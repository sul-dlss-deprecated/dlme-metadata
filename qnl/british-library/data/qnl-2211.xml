Hi Index to the Volume .......... i xi cPART I. I reaties and Engagements relating to Aden and the South-Western Coast of Arabia. ON the expulsion of the Turks in 1630, the greater.part of southern Arabia Jfell into the hands of the Imams of Sanaa. About 1730 the latter were expelled from Aden and other districts by the native Arab tribes, who assumed independence. The tribes and confederations in the region within the sphere of British influence are treated in the following order: — (1) the Abdali (Sultanate of Lahej), (2) the Subeihi, (3) the Fadhli, (4) the Aqrabi, (5) the Aulaqi (Upper and Lower), (6) Irqa, (7) Lower Haura, (8) Beihan, (9) the Yafai (Lower and Upper), (10) the Audhali, (11) the Haushabi, (12) the Alawi, (13) the Amiri (Amirate of Dhala), (14) the Wahidi, (15) the Kathiri (in Hadhramaut), (16) the Qiaiti (Qa'aiti) (Sultanate of Mukalla), (17) Soqotra (Sultanate) and the Mahri (of Qishn), and these are followed by (18) Yemen and (19) Asir (the Idrisi). In 1903-05 a line of demarcation separating the province of Yemen from the territory of tribes in direct treaty relations with His Majesty's c 2ADEN—27ie Abdali. Government was fixed by an Anglo-Turkish Commission appointed for the purpose, and the agreement arrived at was ratified by the Ang o- Turkish Convention signed in London on 9th March 1914 (No. I). This Convention was ratified on the 3rd June 1914. A new chapter in the history of the Aden Protectoiate may be said to have commenced with the outbreak of the Great Wai. The Turks shifted their headquarters from Sanaa to Taiz—close to the frontier of the Aden Protectorate—shortly after their entry into the war in Octo ber 1914. By April 1915 they had fixed their outposts on the vul nerable points of the demarcated frontier on the Haushabi and Amiri border. These Chiefs called upon Aden for assistance under the Pio- tectorate treaties, but none could be given. In June 1915 the Turks pushed their troops into the Protectorate. Ihe Abdali Sultan made an effort to stop their advance on the hills of ISobat Dukeim, but the Turkish machine earns broke the morale of the Abdali riflemen who fell back on Lahej, which was occupied by the Turks on the 5th -Tuly 1915. A military deadlock then ensued for 3^ years till the Armistice in Novem ber 1918, when the Turkish troops evacuated Lahej. After the withdrawal of the Turks from Arabia in 1919 the Imam of Sanaa gradually extended his rule over the Yemen to include the Tihama (coastal tracts) as far as Midi in the north, and also maintained a number of garrison posts in the region under British protection. In the summer of 1928, in consequence of operations by the Eoyal Air Force, the posts in Amiri territory and in the Shaibi section of the Upper Yafai were evacuated but the Imam still occupies the northern portion of Upper Yafa and tlie highland portion of the Audhali tribe. (1) T he A bdali. The district inhabited by this tribe is known as Lahej, and their Chief as Sultan of Lahej. The boundary on the west is undefined; the north-east boundary runs from ISTobat Dukeim to near Bir Aweidein, and thence towards Imad, leaving a strip of land on the sea-coast belong ing to the Fadhli, and meeting the eastern British limit. [See the Shaikh Othman Agreement of 1882 (No. XI).] The Abdali are now the most peaceable of all the tribes in south western Arabia. The first political intercourse with the Chiefs of Aden took place in 1799, when a naval force was sent from Great Britain, with a detach ment of troops from India, to occupy the island of Perim and prevent all communication of the French in Egypt with the Indian Ocean, by way of the Red Sea. The island of Perim was found unsuitable' for troops, and the Sultan of Lahej, Ahmed bin Abdul Karim, received the detachment for some time at Aden. He proposed to enter into anADEN— The Ahdali. alliance and to grant Aden as a permanent station, but the offer was declined. A Treaty (No. II) was, however, concluded with the Sultan in 1802 by Admiral Sir Home Popham, who was instructed to enter into political and commercial alliances with the Chiefs on the Arabian coast of the Eed Sea. From that time there was little or no intercourse with Aden till 1837, when attention was drawn to the plunder and maltreatment of the crews of British vessels wrecked on the Aden coast. The most notable case was that of the Deria Dowlut, the crew of which were stripped and barbarously treated. Captain Haines, who was then em ployed in the survey of the Arabian coast, was instructed to demand satisfaction. He was at the same time to endeavour to purchase Aden as a coaling depot for the steamers plying between India and the lied Sea. Sultan Muhsin, who had succeeded his uncle. Sultan Ahmed, in 1827, at first denied all participation in the plunder; but, finding the British Commissioner firm in his demands, he eventually consented to give up part of the property and pay compensation for the rest. A draft treaty for the cession of Aden was laid before the Sultan, to which he gave his veibal consent and promised formally to agree after consulting his Chiefs. In this draft the amount of compensation to be paid for Aden was left undetermined, but it was afterwards arranged that an annual payment of 8,700 crowns should be made. On the 22nd January 1838 Sultan Muhsin sent a letter under his seal,* engaging to make over Aden, alter two months, but stipulating that his authority over his people in Aden should be maintained after the cession. To the con tinuance of the Sultan's jurisdiction the British Agent objected. The Sultan replied that he was willing to abide by the terms first offered: but, if these were not accepted, his letter of the 22nd January should be returned to him. Negotiations were at this stage when a plot was laid by Ahmed, the Sultan's son, to seize the Agent and rob him of his papers, and delivery of the property stolen from the wreck of the Deria Dowlut was also refused. Preparations were therefore made to coerce the Sultan. On the 19th January 1839 Aden was bombarded and taken, and the Sultan and his family fled to Lahej. On the 2nd February peace was made (No. Ill) in the Sultan's name by his son-in- law, and on the 18th June the Sultan himself signed a Bond (No. IV). engaging to maintain peace and friendship with the British Government, who agreed to pay him and his heirs 6,500 dollars a year, and likewise * At pages 282 and 2?3 of a Collection of Treaties, published by Mr. Hughes Thomas m 1851 under the authority of the Government of Bombay, an extract from a letter of the SuHan of Lahej, dated 23rd January 1838, is given which purports to complete and conclude the transaction for the transfer of Aden to the British Government The facts, however, are, as stated in the text—that in the sequel of tae letter the Sultan desired that the negotiations should be broken off if his jurisdiction in Aden were not admitted : and the bargain owincr to the subsequent course of events, was never concluded.

Peace, however, was soon after broken by an unsuccessful attempt made by Sultan Muhsin in Novem ber 1839 to retake Aden, and the payments were therefore stopped. A second attack made in May 1840 was also unsuccessful, and the repulse of a third attack in July of the same year completely disheartened the Arabs for a time. In LSI-'] Sultan Muhsin came to Aden and sued for peace. An Engagement (No. V) was made on the 11th February 1843, which the British Government considered in the light of an agreement to be observed between the Political Agent and the Sultan, but not of a treaty to be formally ratified. In February 1844, a monthly stipend of 541 dollars was restored to the Sultan with a year's arrears and, before this was paid, another Agreement (No. VI) was taken from him, binding him faithfully to observe his engagements. Sultan Muhsin died on the 30th November 1847, leaving nine sons. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Ahmed, who died on the 18th January 1849, when his next brother, Ali bin Muhsin, succeeded. Short ly after his accession to power, a Treaty (No. VII) of peace, friendship and commerce, which was under negotiation with his predecessor, was concluded with him. Among its other provisions, this treaty stipulated for the restoration of the monthly stipend which had been stopped in consequence of the share taken by the late Chief, Sultan Muhsin, in an attack on Aden in August 1846. Eelations with the new Chief remained on a fairly satisfactory footing till 1857, when, taking umbrage at some fancied wrongs, he entered upon a course of open hostility to the British Government. He was com pletely defeated by an expedition which marched against him in 1858, and the peace which followed remained unbroken till his death in 1863. His son, I 1 adhl (lazl) bin All, was elected bv the tribes and elders to succeed him in the government, but no sooner had he assumed the management of affairs than intrigues were set on foot by other members of the family with a view to his displacement. Ultimately an arrange ment uas effected, through the mediation of the Pesident at Aden and \Aith the consent of the young Chief, by which he was succeeded in the government of the country by his uncle, Fadhl bin Muhsin, fourth son of Sultan Muhsin. For the assistance rendered by Sultan Fadhl bin Muhsin m supplying forage and means of transport for the troops em ployed against the Fadhli tribe in 1865, he was presented with 5 000 dollarg. ( Tn 1867 the Chief consented (No. VIII) to the construction of an aqueduct for the supply of water from the Shaikh Othman wells to Aden, a distance of six miles. t 1 In \ m U in C T &lt; T enoe ot repeated applications by the Sultan of Lahej, lor the protection of the British Government against the Turks.ADEN— The Abdali. i* wlio had demanded liis submission, had occupied a part of Zaida and Shakaa, and had sent troops to support his rebellious brother Abdulla, a fore,3 of British and Indian Infantry with three guns marched to A1 Hauta, the capital of Lahej, to protect the Sultan. After some negotiations the Turkish troops evacuated Lahej and Shakaa, and the Sultan's two brothers and nephew surrendered unconditionally and were conveyed as State prisoners to Aden, while their forts were dismantled. They were subsequently released and retired to Mocha. Sultan Eadhl bin Muhsin died in July 1874, and was succeeded by his nephew, Fadhl bin Ali, who had resigned the Chiefship in his favour in 18G3. The payment of the usual annual stipend of 6,492 dollars was continued to the latter, the amount being increased in 1882 to 19,G92 dollars (see No. XI). In 1877 the Sultan of Lahej was granted a permanent salute of 9 guns. In July 1881 an Agreement (No. IX) was concluded between the Abdali and the Haushabi, by which a portion of the Zaida lands taken from the latter tribe in 1873 was restored to them, and a cause of constant mutual irritation was thus effectually removed. In 1881 the Abdali entered into an Agreement (No. X) by which the Subeihi were placed under their control, the stipends previously received by the latter being made payable to the Abdali. On the 7th February 1882, by a Treaty (No. XI) with the Abdali Sultan, arrangements were made for the purchase, by the British Gov- ernment, of some 35 square miles of territory attached to Shaikh Othman, between the Hiswa and Imad; the salt-pits at Shaikh Othman and the aqueduct between that place and Aden at the same time became British property. Between May and July 1886 the Abdali Chief made repeated complaints of the hardships entailed by the Subeihi Agreement, from which he wished to withdraw entirely. In August he reported that one of his garrisons had been massacred, and that all the others were sur rounded by the Subeihi, and craved assistance in rescuing them. The llesident despatched 50 sabres of the Aden troop (which had been raised in 1865 for police purposes) to support him, and also lent him rifles and ammunition. These proceedings resulted in the safe withdrawal of the garrisons; but from this date the Subeihi agreement became practically inoperative, and the various Subeihi tribes resumed their old position of independent relations with the Aden Residency. At the close of 1886 the Abdali bought back from the Haushabi the lands referred to in the Zaida Agreement (see No. IX), and the Resident thereupon intimated to both Chiefs that articles 1 and 2 of that agree ment were held to be cancelled, with the exception of the words per- mitting the Haushabi to erect a house at A1 Anad,6 ADEN— The Abdali. In 1894, owing to the heavy taxes levied on qafilahs by the Haushabi Sultan Muhsin bin Ali, the Abdali entered Ilan-habi territory and its Sultan fled. He was repudiated by his Shaikhs and, at their request, Sultan Fadhl bin Ali made suitable arrangements for administering their country and protecting the trade routes. The e^-Haushabi Sultan eventually gave himself up at Lahej and on the 6th August 1895 signed an Agreement (No, XII) by which his territory was restored to him under certain guarantees. On the 27th April 1898 Sultan Fadhl bin Ali died, lie was suc ceeded by his cousin, Ahmed Fadhl, to whom the payment of the usual annual stipend was continued. In April 1899, owing to continual robberies by the Subeihi, the Abdali were given permission to occupy Bas al Arah, Turan and Am Rija in the Subeihi country. In November the Abdali raised a force against the Atifi section in consequence of an attack made by the latter on Bar al Kudeimi. The Atiti then submitted. In 1902 the Sultan again raised a force to suppress the Subeihi. After a few skirmishes he returned to Lahej. In September 190G the Rijai Shaikh signed an agreement formally acknowledging himself as the vassal of the Abdali. In 1910 a Convention (No. XIII) was executed with the Sultan, by which he ceded to Government a piece of land on the left bank and eastward of Wadi As-Saghir for use as headworks of the water supply of Aden. The Convention was ratified on the 17th ITarch 1911. It however, became a dead letter, as the scheme has been abandoned. In (h 1914 Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadhl died. He was succeeded by his cousin, Ali bin Ahmed to whom the payment of the usual annual stipend was continued. In July 1915 a Turkish force under General Said Pasha from the Yamen attacked and captured Lahej which they retained till the end of the war. The Sultan, whose irregular troops were unable to offer successful resistance, abandoned his country to the enemy and retired with the British troops which had been hastilv despatched to defend Lahej. The Sultan died at Aden from wounds received during the attack on Lahej. * IlS sllcc « ssor Sultan Abdul Karim is the sou of a former Chief, l-adh hm Al, H,s electron took place in Aden, where he was a refugee the Mrt'™ I ToTo Was formall y installed in his capital on the 14th December 1918, after the surrender of the Turkish iarrison Mni 'V'' 1 r' ' ^ lsh ' aiKl was granted a sum of £10,(100 by His o hif lovaU OVern T, Ut ^ u,T* 0f tlleir a nd appreciation h s eonntrv y Th t e r bIe j hlm to &gt;e-establ,sh the adminislration of his country.

In February 1919 the Subeihi were again placed under the control of the Abdali (No. XIV). The ratification of this agreement has been postponed by His Majesty's Government until after the final settlement of the future political status of Arabia. The agreement, although only in partial operation during recent years has had the effect of strengthening the influence of the Sultan of Lahej in the Subeihi area. In January 1919, in consequence of incursions by the Imam into the Protectorate and the resulting danger to Lahej, a force of British troops was sent to garrison Nobat Dukeim. It was withdrawn in July 1922 but a small detachment of Indian troops was left at Habil. This was withdrawn in April 1928. The Sultan visited India in 1922 and England in 1924 when he was received by His Majesty the King, together with his son Fadhl. He visited India again in 1930. The Resident convened the first Conference of ruling' chiefs of the Protectorate in April 1929. The Conference was held at Lahej under the Presidency of the Abdali Sultan and was reconvened in December 1930. The gross revenue of the tribe is estimated at Rs. 2,75,000 a year, and the population amounts to about 35,000. (2) T he S ubeihi. The Subeihi are a large tribe occupying the country bordering on the sea from Has Imran to Bab al Mandeb, who owe allegiance to no paramount Chief, but are divided into a number of petty clans. In 1839, after the capture of Aden, several Engagements (No. XV) were arranged with Chiefs of this tribe; but until 1871 the only Chiefs enjoy ing stipends from the British Government were the heads of the Dubeini and Ilijai clans. In that year the Mansuri clan attacked and plundered a caravan coming into Aden. A detachment of the Aden troop, which had been raised in 1865 for police purposes, was despatched against them, and an action ensued in which one of the Chiefs and most of his party were killed. Eventually, in 1871, the Subeihi Chiefs came into Aden and tendered their submission: they also entered into Engagements (No. XVI) to preserve the peace of the roads, to restore plundered property, and to abolish transit duties and taxes on the roads passing through their territories, in return for monthly stipends.* An additional Engagement (No. XVII) was also signed in 1871 by the Mansuri Chief, by which he admitted his responsibility for the good behaviour of the Kuraisi. * The Mansuri |25, Maldidumi 130, and Ilijai ^40,ADEN— Tke, Subcthi.

Tn 1886, however, as detailed above m the account of the Abdali, the Subeihi agreement became inoperative, the various Subeihi tribes'resumed their old position of independent relations with the Aden Residency, and their stipends were restored to them. Tn 1889 Protectorate Treaties (Nos. XIX and XX) were made with the Atifi and Barhimi. These were ratified on the 26th February 1890. In April 1899, owing to continual robberies by the Subeihi, the Abdali Sultan was given permission to occupy Ras al Arab, I uran and Am Eija. In November the Atifi attacked an Abdali post, but when the Abdali collected a large force the Atifi submitted. In 1900 Muhammad Salih Tatar, the late Native Assistant Resident, took refuse among the Mansuri and Makhdumi and incited them to plunder. In 1902 the Abdali collected a large force and several skirmishes took place in Subeihi country. The Subeihi continued to plunder during 1904. In March 1904 Captain Warneford was murdered at Am Eija on his wav To join the Boundary Commission as political officer. By May the boundary was demarcated. No opposition was experienced from any tribe, except the Khalifi, Atawi and Tazeri. A postal sowar carrying Government mails was shot by a raiding party of Atifi near Shaikh Othman in January 1906. The greater part of the mails was recovered, but the tribesmen, failing to surrender the offenders as they were called upon to do, were prohibited from enter ing Aden and payment of their stipend was suspended. Salih Ba Haidara the Eijai, murderer of Captain Warneford, was shot by a dependant of the Mansuri Shaikh in March 1900. In July 1906, a dhow flying Italian colours was wrecked and pillaged oft the Barhimi coast. The Barhimi Shaikh was ordered to pav compen sation; but, he having failed to do so. the amount. Rs. 2,450, was paid bv Government and subsequently deducted from his stipend. Some of the Subeihi clans, notably the Dubini and Rijai, took part in the looting of Shaikh Othman after the capture of Lahei bv the Turks in 1915,ADEN— The Subeihi and the Fadhli. 9 In February 1919, an Agreement [see No. XIV) was concluded with I he Abdali Saltan placing' the Subeihi again under his general control. The agreement has been put into partial operation during recent years. In September 1927 a large force of Imamic troops invaded Subeihi territory in the neighbourhood of Turan, but retired as the result of warnings of air action. In December 1928, when a curtailment of doles and entertainment to the chiefs was effected, the tribesmen became restive and resorted to their old tactics of murder and pillage. They were ordered to cease and to make restitution for their offences and, on their refusing to do so, air action was taken against the more guilty parties. The tribesmen eventually made their submission. The gross revenue of the tribe is estimated at lis. 8,000 a year, and the population at 20,000. (3) T he F adhli. The Fadhli, with whom an Engagement (No. XXI) was concluded by the British Government in -Inly 1839, after the capture of Aden, are one of the most powerful and warlike tribes near Aden. Their pos sessions lie to the north-east of that settlement, and extend for a hundred miles alonsr the coast from the eastern limits of the Abdali near Imad to the western boundary of the Aulaqi at Maqatin. The Sultan of Lahej for many years paid annual subsidies to the neighbouring tribes, including the Fadhli, through whose territory the trade of the country passed, and these payments were at first continued by the British Government on condition of the Chiefs remaining in friendly alliance. Owing, however, to the weakness of the character of Sultan Ali bin Muhsin of Lahej, through whom it was the early policy of the British Agent to transact all business with the Arabs of the country round Aden, the neighbouring tribes ventured for some years to perpetrate a series of atrocities upon individual British officers and others, which the Sultan was quite unable to prevent or punish. His efforts, indeed, to procure compliance with the demands of the British Government for satisfaction for these outrages brought on him the hostility of his rivals, the Fadhli tribe, who had sheltered some of the murderers, and who endeavoured to stir up the neighbouring tribes to hostilities with the British. The stipend of the Fadhli Chief, which had been assigned to him by the engagement of 1839, was stopped till he should expel the criminals who had taken refuge with him. This he did and, on the restoration of his stipend, he voluntarily signed an Agreement (No. XXII) to protect the roads from Aden through his territory. But the inability of the Sultan of Lahej to prevent or10 ADEN— The Fadhli. punish, crimes committed by the adjacent tribes necessitated a cliange in policy and the commencement of intercourse witli their Chiefs direct, instead of through the Sultan as medium. For some years after the introduction of this system the conduct of the Fadhli Sultan, Ahmed bin Abdulla, was satisfactory. By his be haviour at the wreck of the State!ie in January 1804 he earned the approbation of the British Government; but soon afterwards, either from dissatisfaction at the amount of the reward granted to him for his services on this occasion, or out of jealousy at the intimacy of British relations with the Sultan of Lahej, he resumed his attitude of persistent hostility. Within gunshot of the fortifications of Aden he plundered a caravan, and assembled a large force with the object of destroying the crops of the Abdali and defying the authority of the British Gov ernment. A small body of troops was accordingly despatched against him in December 1865; he was defeated and compelled to seek safety in flight, while the troops entered the Fadhli country and destroyed several villages. The seaport of Shuqra was at first spared, in hopes that the punishment already administered would prove sufficient; but, some further outrages having been perpetrated by the Fadhli, another ex pedition left Aden, destroyed the forts inland, and returned within three days, thus showing the Fadhli that they could be approached by land or by sea with equal facility. It was decided that either the Sultan or his son should enter Aden and tender unconditional submission before friendly relations could be resumed. All other overtures were declined and, in March 1867, a letter was received from the Sultan stating his wish to send his elder son to tender the submission of the tribe. A safe conduct was granted and finally a Treaty (No. XXIII), embodying the prescribed terms, was signed by the Sultan in 1867 the Resident agreeing on the part of the British Government that the past should be forgotten. This Treaty has been authoritatively declared to be the only oue now m force. In accordance with article 4, a relation of the Sultan was deputed to reside in Aden as a permanent hostage; but, on his death m IS ,1 this article was allowed to remain in abeyance. Shortly after the ratification of the Treaty of 1867 the stipend of the Fadhli Sultan was ra.sed from 30 dollars to 100 dollars a month. Sultan Ahmed bin Abdulla died in February 1870, and was succeeded by his eldest so,, Haulara, who was assassinated in August 1877. His brother Sultan Husem was beheyed to be the murderer and was expelled by the tribe Who elected the latter's son Ahmed to be their fhi't. The succession Was lecognise &gt;y the British Goyernment.

He was liberated in December 1886, and bis conduct after his release gave no cause for uneasiness. In 1872 tlie tribe agreed (No. XXIV) to abolish transit duties on goods conveyed to and from Aden through their territories, in con sideration of which the Chief's stipend was further increased to 180 dollars a month. In 1881 a boundary dispute, which had long caused ill-feeling between the Fadhli and Abdali, was terminated by the conclusion of a Treaty (No. XXV) defining their respective limits. In 1883 it was reported that the Lower Aulaqi had invaded Fadhli territory, and a force was despatched from Aden by sea and land to the assistance of the latter. Xo invasion having actually taken place, the force was withdrawn; but it did take place shortly afterwards and resulted in complete failure. In 1888 territorial disputes arose between the Lower Tafai and the Fadhli and the former cut off the water supply of the Xaza Canal; a desultory strife continued for some time between the tribes with occa sional short truces. In August 1888 a Protectorate Treaty (No. XXVI) was concluded with the Fadhli, which was ratified on the 26th February 1890. In October 1891, in consequence of the misconduct of the Fadhli^ it became necessary to impose a fine of Es. 1,000 upon the Sultan, and to suspend the payment of his stipend. The advisability of reviving the fourth article of the agreement of 1867, requiring the residence of a Fadhli representative at Aden, was also taken into consideration. In December 1891, however, on his making full submission, the punish ment was in part remitted by the Government of India. In 1892 and the following year desultory strife, interrupted by short truces, continued with the Lower afaj over the water-supply of the Xaza. In 189'j a truce was made for one year and was continued in 1894 and the following years. The Marqashi also gave considerable trouble by plundering in British territory. The Sultan finally declared himself responsible for them. In 1899 at the Sultan's request his two brothers, Salih and Abdulla, were deported to India for conspiring against him. In 1900 Salih died at Karachi, and Abdulla was released. Hostilities with the Yafai recommenced in consequence of the Sultan having established a new customs post at Zanzibar for the purpose of levying dues on qafilahs. All efforts to effect a reconciliation failed, till m 1J04 the Sultan 'visited the Resident at Aden, and promised to stop levying dues and to abandon his post at Zanzibar.12 ADEN—T/(e b'adhli and the Aqrabi. In 1906 the Sultan was reported to have commenced levying transit dues on qafilahs at Zanzibar. In reply to representations on the subject lie urged tlmt these were onlv fees willingly paid for escorts turnished to caravans beyond his own limits, and the matter was not pursued. Hostilities with the Lower Yafai continued intermittently. In March 1907 Sultan Ahmed bin Ilnsein died and was succeeded by hi-; father Husein bin Ahmed. The Sultan was considered disloyal during the Great War, on account of an agreement which he signed with the I urks at Lahej, and his stipend was stopped. After the Armistice he satisfactorily explained his conduct and the stipend was restored. In 1924 the Sultan died and was succeeded by his grandson, Saltan Abdul Qadir. In 1926 a truce was made between the Fadhli and the Lower Yaf'ai for one year. This has sine? been extended to four years. In March 1927 Sultan Abdul Qadir died and was succeeded bv his ancle Sultan Abdulla bin Husein, In June 1929 the Sultan of Lahej settled the long-standing quarrel between the Ahl Fadhl and the Lower Yafai. Khanfar was restored to Lower Yafai and the Fadhli Sultan was permitted to levy dues on Lo^er Yafai exports and imports passing through his territory at a fixed rate. The population of this tribe is estimated at 24,000, and the gross revenue at lis, 35,000 a year. The Fadhli Sultan is entitled to a salute of 9 guns, which was formally gazetted on the 1st January 1877. (4) T he A qrabi.

They inhabit the coast-line from Bir Ahmed to lias Imran; inland their territory extends to an undefined point between Bir Ahmed and Wahat. The only town, or rather village, is that of Bir Ahmad. An Engagement (Xo. XXYII) was concluded m 1S:J9 with their Shaikh. Haidara Mehdi. after the capture of Aden, and it was adhered to until the date of the third attack upon the fortress m July 1840. Thenceforward for many years their attitude was one ol hostility.

In 1863 an Agreement (No. XXIX) was made with him, by which he engaged not to sell, mortgage, or give for occupation, save to the l^iitish Government, any portion of the peninsula of little Aden. In return he was to receive an immediate payment of 3,000 dollars, and a monthly stipend of 30 dollars. These terms were not considered entirely satisfactory by Her Majesty's Government, and the Resident was instructed to treat for the complete and unreserved acquisition of the peninsula. After tedious negotiations, which were further protracted by the necessity of investigating the claims of other tribes to this territory, the purchase was concluded (No. XXX) on the 2nd April 18G9 for a sum of 30,000 dollars, the stipend of the Shaikh being at the same time raised to 40 dollars a month. The animosity, always latent, between the Abdali and Aqrabi, broke out in 1887, and in August of that year the Abdali besieged Bir Ahmed in a desultory fashion. Eventually, as the British limits at Al Hiswa were disturbed, the Resident intervened; the Abdali evacuated Aqrabi territory, and peace was restored on the Gth September. Negotiations were commenced in 1887 for the acquisition of a strip of foreshore to connect the British limits at Al Hiswa and Bandar Fukum. They were brought to a satisfactory conclusion by an Agree ment (No. XXXI), dated the 15th July 1888, the Aqrabi Shaikh dis posing of his title for an immediate payment of Rs. 2,000. In 1888 a Protectorate Treaty was concluded (No. XXXII) with the Aqrabi, similar to that arranged with several other tribes, and was ratified on the 26th February 1890. Shaikh Abdulla died in March 1905, and was succeeded by his son. Shaikh Fadhl bin Abdulla bin Haidara. In 1915 the Turkish commander at Lahej sent a Turkish flag to the Aqrabi Shaikh to be flown on his residence. The Shaikh did not do this, but sent it to the Resident at Aden. For this act he was vilified by the Turkish commander, whose letter to the Shaikh was sent by the latter to Aden. Shortly afterwards a party of Turks and their Somali mercenaries surrounded the Shaikh's house in Bir Ahmed and he was taken to Lahej, where he was imprisoned in fetters for about a year, and then released and kept in Lahej under surveillance till the end of the war. The refugees from Aqrabi territory were housed and maintained in Aden until the end of the war. The Aqrabi Shaikh and his subjects were given a Slim of Rs. 24,000 with which to rebuild Bir Ahmed. His cross annual revenue amounts to about Rs. 2,000. His tribesmen n number about 1,000. :-3 * ■ ! n The Aulnqi. T he A ulaqi.

The Upper Aulaqi are again subdivided, part being under the rule of a Sultan who resides at Nisab, and part governed by a Shaikh who is nearly as powerful as the Sultan, and lives at Said. The Aulaqi country is bounded on the north by the Beihan district, on the west by the Beidha district and Audhali and Fadlili tribes, on the south by the Sea and on the east by the Abdul Wahid tribe. The boundary between Upper and Lower Aulaqi ii-; roughly the mountain scarp of the Kor al Aulaqi. (a) The Upper Aulaqi Sultan. In September 1879 Sultan Awadh bin Abdulla was dethroned m consequence of old age and was succeeded by his eldest son Abdulla. Sultan Abdulla bin Awadh died on the 11th December 1887 and was succeeded by his son the present Sultan, Salih bin Abdulla. A Treaty (No. XXXIY) was concluded with the Upper Aulaqi Sultan on the 18th March 1904 and ratified on the 23rd April 1904. [h) The Upper Aulaqi Shaikh. Shaikh Farid bin Nasir died on the 2nd June 1883 and was succeeded by his eldest son Ruweis. Jluweis was deposed by his tribesmen in 1890 and was succeeded by his brother Um Rasas bin Farid, who died in July 1902 and was succeeded by his brother the present Shaikh, Muhsin bin Farid. In 1889 the Upper Aulaqi Shaikh voluntarily signed an agreement abandoning all customary rights over the Fadhli and Abdali. On the 8th December 1903 a Treaty (No. XXXTII) was concluded at Aden with the Upper Aulaqi Shaikh and was ratified on the 5th Febru ary 1904. In October 1918 Shaikh Yeslam Barweis, son of the late Upper Aulaqi Shaikh received a Commission in the 1st Yemen Infantry as Yuzbashi m which he remained till its disbandment in March 1925. On the raising of the Aden Protectorate Levies in April 1938 he became Senior Arab Omcer and remained so until his death in September 1929. The population of this tribe is estimated at 30,000.

He was murdered, together with his son Abdulla, in July 18Gf3, and was succeeded by his cousin, Bubakar bin Abdulla. The authority of the Lower Aulaqi Sultan over his tribe is rather limited, and Sultan Bubakar bin Abdulla was not always able to prevent the plunder of vessels wrecked on his coast. In 1871, however, he bound himself by an engagement to use his best endeavours to prevent such outrages in future, and to protect, and if possible convey to Aden, any shipwrecked seamen who might stand in need of his assistance. In 1883 dissensions broke out between the Fadhli and Lower Aulaqi, leading to a raid on Fadhli territory. The Lower Aulaqi were defeated with considerable loss. A Protectorate Treaty (No. XXXVI) was concluded with the Sultan in 1888, and was ratified on the 26th February 1890. In 1892 Sultan Bubakar resigned the chiefship in favour of Salih bin Ali bin Nasir, a distant relative. The Government sanctioned this arrangement and continued his stipend to his successor. Sultan Salih bin Ali bin Nasir resigned the chiefship in 1900, and Sultan Ali bin Munassar succeeded him. The latter died in 1902 and was succeeded by Sultan Nasir bin Bubakar. In 1904 some Fadhli tribesmen fired on a Lower Aulaqi dhow, and in consequence the old feud between the two tribes broke out again. There was little actual fighting, and at the end of the year a truce was proclaimed. In 1912 Sultan Nasir bin Bubakar died. He was succeeded by Sultan Bubakar bin Nasir. In 1924 Sultan Bubakar abdicated in favour of his cousin, Munassar bin Ali. He was recognised by His Majesty's Government as the ruling chief of the Lower Aulaqi tribe, and the payment of the usual annual stipend was continued to him. In June 1929 a Greek ship, the Hevmes, ran out of coal and went ashore about 25 miles north-east of Ahwar. The Lower Aulaqi Sultan carried out the terms of his salvage treaty satisfactorily. In April 1930 Sultan Munassar bin Ali died and so far (December 1930) no successor has been elected owing to family dissensions. The population of the Lower Aulaqi tribe is estimated at 15,000, and the gross revenue at Rs. 10,000 a year : (G) Irqa. Since 1888 the Shaikh of Irqa has received a stipend.

The Shaikhs reside at Lower Haura, a seaport about 12 miles from Irqa. Siuce 1888 an annual stipend has been paid to them, and a Protectorate Treaty (No. XXXIX) was concluded with them in that year.

He was succeeded by Shaikh Said bin Abdulla ba Shahid who abdicated in February 1896, being succeeded by his brother. Shaikh Ahmed bin Abdulla. The latter died in March 1900, and was succeeded by Shaikh Saleh bin Awadh. A revised Protectorate Treaty (No. XL) was concluded with the latter in April 1902, when his stipend was increased from 50 to 180 dollars. On the 6th October 1917 Shaikh Salih bin Awadh died. He was Succeeded by his son, Awadh bin Salih. (8) B eiitan. This district lies to the north of the Beidha district and north-west of the Upper Aulaqi country. It lies on either side of the Wadi Beihan, in the valley of which the bulk of the population reside. The lower portion of the Wadi Beihan is occupied by the Sharif and his relations together with the Bal Harith tribe and the upper portion by the Ahl Masabein, a powerful tribe, who form the bulk of the fighting men in the district. The headquarters of the Sharif is at An Nuqub, of the Bal Harith at As Seilan and of the Masabein at Beihan al Qasab. It was not until the question of demarcating the north-eastern fron tier arose that any intercourse was held with it. In December 1903 a Treaty (No. XLI) was concluded with Sharif Ahmed bin Muhsin. This treaty is considered to include the Ahl Masabein in its terms. He draws a monthly stipend of 30 dollars. In June 1930 the troops of the Imam of Sanaa who had advanced to the Harib district, north-west of Beihan, with headquarters at Al Joha and Darb al Ali, began to encroach on Al Ain, which is inhabited by Masabi tribesmen. The population of this district is estimated at 11,000.ADEN—T/te Yafat 17 (9) tiiE YAFAI. This tribe is divided into two sections, the Lower and XTpper Yafai. Their territory inland is very extensive, but the maritime districts east of Aden, which formerly belonged to the tribe and extended to the frontiers of Hadhramant, were wrested from them by the Fadhli shortly before the capture of Aden. The Yafai are among the most travelled of the hinterland tribes, owing to their communications with India, Java and Borneo, where thev trade and also serve as mercenaries. (o) The Lower Yafai. Soon after the capture of Aden an Engagement (No. XLII) was entered into in 1839 with Ali bin Ghalib, Sultan of the Lower Yafai, similar to that concluded with the Abdali and Fadhli Sultans. It lias been loyally adhered to. Sultan Ali bin Ghalib died in 1841 at a great age, and was succeeded by his son, Ahmed bin Ali. He died in September 1873, and was suc ceeded by his son, Ali bin Ahmed, who was succeeded by his brother, Muhsin bin Ahmed, in May 1885. The latter died in July 1891, and his nephew. Sultan Ahmed bin Ali, was elected as his successor. The Government of India sanctioned the continuance to him, with effect from the 20th July 1891, of the annual stipend of 250 dollars enjoyed by the late Sultan. In 1873 hostilities broke out between the Yafai and the Fadhli, in consequence of the Yafai Sultan having repudiated an engagement, concluded on his behalf by his son and in the presence of the Resident at Aden, whereby he had consented to accept from the Fadhli Sultan a royalty of 25 dollars a year for the use of water for irrigation. For this breach of faith the stipend of the Yafai Sultan was temporarily withheld. From 1888 to 1893 desultory strife, interrupted by short truces, was carried on with the Fadhli over the water-supply from the Naza channel. In 1893 a truce was made and was kept for several years. In 1893 Sultan Ahmed bin Ali visited Aden on his way to Mecca, where he died on the 27th June. He was succeeded by Sultan Bubakar bin Seif. On the 1st August 1895 a Protectorate Treaty (No. XLIII) was con cluded with the Lower Yafai. In 1899 Sultan Bubakar bin Seif died. He was succeeded by Sultan Abdulla bin Muhsin. i) 2In 1902 the Fadlili Sultan established a new customs post at Zanzibar and levied dues on Yafai qafilahs. The Yafai retahated by cutting off the water-supply from the Xaza channe ie a i then attacked Al Husn and Ar Eawa. In 1903 the Kesident endeavoured to effect a settlement, but the Yafai Sultan refused to attend the con ference In 1904 the Fadhli attacked Ar Eawa and Khanfar, taking possession of the latter and for a time no settlement was reached; while relations with the Lower Yafai Sultan continued strained, partly owing to his dissatisfaction with the position accorded to certain sections of the Upper Yafai, over whom he is inclined to assert a claim to general suzerainty, and partly to his dissatisfaction with the rank and precedence assigned to himself. In 1916 Sultan Abdulla bin Muhsin died. He was succeeded by his cousin, Sultan Muhsin bin Ali, who renewed friendly relations with the Aden Residency, to which he paid periodical visits. In 1925 Sultan Muhsin bin Ali died and was succeeded by his son. Sultan Aidrus bin Muhsin bin Ali. This Sultan has established his per sonal authority over the whole of the Lower \ afai clans. In June 192G a truce of four years was concluded between the Lower Yafai and Fadhli Sultans. In June 1929 the Sultan of Lahej settled this long-standing feud and restored Khanfar to the Lower Yafai. In November 1925 Major M. C. Lake was sent on a special Mission to Lower and Upper Yafai. Sultan Aidrus accorded him a warm wel come and gave him every assistance in his journey. In 192G Sultan Aidrus bin Muhsin was granted a personal salute of 9 guns. The population of Lower Yafai is estimated at 70,000, and the gross revenue at Es. 1G,000 a year. (/;) The Zipper Yafai. The Upper Yafai are divided into several independent sub-sections most of which have separate Protectorate Treaties with Government. In 1895 Sultan Qahtan bin Umar succeeded to the titular chiefship on the death of Sultan Muhammad bin Ali. Very few dealings were held with the Upper Yafai till 1903, when in that year it was proposed to demarcate the north-eastern frontier. Treaties (Nos. XLIV to XLIX) were concluded with the Dhubi, Mausatta and Muflahi sections, with Sultan Qahtan as titular chief of the whole tribe, and with the Hadh- rami and Shaibi sections. In August the Shaibi frontier was demar cated; but, on the survey party entering the Rubiatein district, a post which had been established at Awabil was attacked by Sultan Salih binADEN—-T/ie Yafai. 19 TJmar, Sultan Qalitan's brother. Tlie attack was repelled; but, as tlie Turks declared tbat any advance into tlie Eada district would imperil tbe negotiations tben proceeding between the two countries, all attempts to demarcate the north-eastern frontier were abandoned. In October 1903 an Agreement (No. L) was made by Shaikh Mutahir Ali of the Shaibi tribe, by which he undertook to look after the boundary pillars for a monthly stipend of 7 dollars. In 1904 owing to the agreement entered into with the British Government, Sultan Qahtan bin Umar was deposed by tribesmen headed by his brother, Salih. In 1905 Government sanctioned the gift to Sultan Qahtan of |3,000 as assistance towards effecting his rehabilita tion. The Shaibi tribesmen have their headmen of clans, who owe a sort of allegiance to a stipendiary by name Shaikh Ali Mana, the Saqladi. The Nuqaba of Mausatta, two of whom share the stipend granted to them by His Majesty's Government under the terms of their Treaty, assert that they have considerable influence in Shaibi; and Shaikh Ali Muhsiii Askar, the son of Muhsin Askar (one Mausatta stipendiary), frequently visited the country as mediator. In recognition ot his importance, Ali Muhsin Askar was granted an allowance of $20 a month, so long as he remained faithful to Government. In 1906 Ali Muhsin Askar, owing to a fancied slight which he asserted that he had received in Aden, returned to the Shaibi country and knock ed down a boundary pillar. His allowance was stopped till he came into Dhala before the Resident and asked for pardon. In 1913 Sultan Qahtan died, without having succeeded in getting himself reinstated. He was succeeded by his son. Sultan Umar, but his recognition was withheld by Government who gave him one year's time within which to bring about his rehabilitation, and continued to him provisionally the stipend paid to his father. The period was extended from year to year till 1919, when he abdicated in favour of his uncle Salih. The latter had been accepted by the Muflahi section as their Sultan in 1911, and in 1920 he was recognised by His Majesty's Govern ment and was granted the stipend previously paid to Sultan Umar. November 1919 the Imam of Sanaa s tioops oaptuied Sliaib, Eubiatein, Nawa and Dhabiani. They were compelled to evacuate Shaib in July 1928 but still occupy the other three Yafai sections. In 1923, with a view to checking the advance of the troops of the Imam of Sanaa, Khan Bahadur Sayyid Husein bin Hamid el Mehdar, the Minister of the Sultan of Shihr and Mnkalla, paid a special visit to Upper Yafa, with the approval of the Resident, and obtained the signatures of the Yafai Shaikhs to an agreement by which they declared themselves bound by their existing treaties with Great Britain and20 ADEN—T/ie Yafai, the Audhali and the Haushahi. pledged themselves to tribal unity and combination against any aggressors. This agreement contributed to the successful co-operation of ''the Upper Yafai tribes in the expulsion of the Imam's forces from Shaibi territory in July 1928. Sultan Salih bin Umar abdicated in 1927 in favour of his son, Sultan Muhammad bin Salih, who was accorded recognition by His Majesty's Government. The numbers of the Tapper Yafai tribesmen are estimated \erj ap proximately at 80,000. (10) The Audhali. The Audhali country is of considerable extent and lies between the Fadhli on the south, Aulaqi on the east and Yafai on the west. The Sultan made overtures for treaty relations in 1902, but he was not at the time considered of sufficient importance to be encouraged. In 1903, owing to their supposed complicity with the Ahl Am Saidi of Dathina in an attack on a British survey party, the Audhali were ex cluded from Aden; but the overtures were continued, and in September 1914 a Protectorate Treaty (Xo. LI) was concluded with Sultan Qasim bin Ahmed. He was killed in September 1928 by the brothers Muham mad and Husein Jabil, of another branch of the family, and was suc ceeded by the son of the latter, Salih, a minor, under the regency of his uncle Muhammad. In 1923 the Imam's troops invaded and occupied the highland portion of Audhali territory known as Adh Dhahir. In 1925, in consequence of their encroaching still further and occupying the lowland portion, known as A1 Kor, and the commercial town of Lodar together with the adjoin ing village of A1 Kubeida where the Sultan resided, air action was taken against them with tribal co-operation and they were compelled to withdraw from the lowland portion, but are still in possession of the highlands. Ahmed, the son of the murdered Sultan, and Qasim bin Abdulla, his cousin, have formed a rival faction to the brothers Jabil and have thrown in their lot with the Amil of Beidha, under the Imam, taking up their residence at Aryab in the highlands. (11) The Haushabi. On the 14th June 1839 an Engagement (Xo. LII) was entered into with Sultan Mana bin Salam of this tribe, of the same tenor as those with the Abdali, the Fadhli and the Yafai. In the previous January a Treaty (No. LIII) of friendship and peace had been signed bv two other Shaikhs of the Haushabi tribe with the British representative.ADEN— The Haushahi- 21 Sultan Mana bin Salam, tliongli more than once invited by tlie Abdali and Fadlili Shaikhs to join them in their attacks upon Aden, steadily declined their overtures. He died in June 1858, and was succeeded by his nephew, TJbeid bin Yahya, during whose rule friendly relations were uninterruptedly maintained with the Haushabi. IJbeid bin Yahya died in 1863, and was succeeded by his cousin, Ali bin Mana. Ihe relations of Sultan Ali bin Mana with the neighbouring Chiefs and the British Government were for a long time the reverse of cordial. In 18G8 he cut oft 1 the supply of water from a rivulet which irrigates the Lahej territory, and destroyed the crops on lands belonging to the Sultan of Lahej. An action ensued in which the Haushabi Sultan was defeated. In payment of the loss suffered by the Sultan of Lahej, Sultan Ali bin Mana ceded to him the town of Zaida and its lands which had formerly belonged to Lahej, and the dispute was temporarily settled by the friend ly intervention of the Resident. In October 1869 the ITaushabi Sultan s stipend was stopped in consequence of the outrages committed by him on the Aden road; the proximate cause of this misconduct was the tenure of Zaida by the Sultan of Lahej, who was therefore induced to make over to his rival a small portion of that district. The Haushabi Sultan was not satisfied, and in 18T3 commenced intrigues with the Turkish authorities at Taiz in the hope of thereby regaining possession of Zaida. Supported by Turkish troops he held for some little time a part of Zaida, but on their withdrawal from the neighbourhood of Lahej he was com pelled to retire. The Sultan of Lahej was induced by the Resident to renew his offer of a portion of Zaida to the Haushabi Sultan; but, as the latter insisted on receiving the fort of Shakaa, which commands the rivulet and conse quently the supply of water to Lahej, the negotiations failed for the time. They were, however, renewed with success in 1881, when, as recorded in the account of the Abdali, an Agreement {see No. IX) was signed by both Sultans. In 1886 this agreement was modified by the action of the Haushabi Sultan in selling his lands at Zaida to the Abdali. Sultan Ali bin Mana died in May 1886, and was succeeded by his son, Muhsin bin Ali. On the 15th November 1888, the Sultan signed an Agreement (Appendix No. I) in conjunction with the Alawi and Quteibi Shaikhs and the Amir of Dhala, fixing the rates to be levied on merchandise. In 1894, owing to' the heavy taxes laid on qafilahs by Sultan Muhsin bin Ali, the Abdali entered his country and he was obliged to flee. He was repudiated by his Shaikhs and at their request the Abdali Sultan was elected in his place. Muhsin bin Ali, having failed in his intrigues with the Turks, submitted to the Abdali Sultan and accepted an asylum at Ar Raha with a stipend. On the 6th August 1895 he signed an Agree ment (No. LIV) by which his territory was restored to him under certain22 ADEN—T/ie Uaushahi. guarantees. On tlie same date a Protectorate Treaty (No. LV) was con- cluded with him. In 1900 Muhammad bin Nasir Muqbil, a Shaikh of the Humar tribe, and a Turkish Mudir, built a fort in Haushabi limits which the Turks garrisoned. The Turkish authorities were requested to evacuate it but refused, and the Haushabi Sultan was given permission to drive them out. The attempt, however, failed, and in July 1901 a force of 500 men was despatched from Aden. The Turks and Muhammad bin Nasir Muqbil's adherents were driven from Iheir posiiion at Ad Dareija on the 2Gth July and the expedition returned to Aden. In 1902 several fights took place with the Abdali and the trade routes were stopped for a time. In 1903 the boundary commission demarcated the ITaushabi frontier. On the 28tli September 1904 Sultan Muhsin bin Ali died. He was succeeded by Sultan Ali Mana, Subsequent to the election of Sultan Ali Mana, the question of his relations with the Abdali Sultan had been under the consideration of Government. The decision was that, with the consent of both the Sultans, the relations agreed upon by their predecessors in 1895 should continue. From 1905 ihe Abdali-Haushabi relations were revived in accordance with the arrangements made between their predecessors in 1895, and became satisfactory. Throughout 1906 the Haushabi Sultan was harassed bv his Subeihi neighbours and an Abdali-Haushabi combination was formed against these marauders, resulting in the Haushabi imprisoning the leaders of the Jabbara section at Museimir. The Abdali assistance was, however, purely nominal. Certain Abdali working in the vicinity of the British post at Nobat thikeim were attacked by Subeihi of the Jabbara section. The motive was to retaliate on the Abdali Sultan who had refused them presents at Lahej. The Subeihi retired after exchanging a few shots. In 1914 the Haushabi Sultan Ali Mana signed an Agreement (No. LVI) for the safety of the trade routes in his territory. Under the terms of their agreement the Haushabi Sultan was granted a monthly payment of 64 dollars in addition to his stipend and agreed to keep a force of 50 men and to maintain posts in certain named places on the trade route. In July 1915 the Haushabi Sultan joined in the Turkish attack on Lahej, but came to Aden at the beginning of 1919 to ask for pardon. He explained that he did not go over to the Turks voluntarily, but was compelled by them to join their forces. This explanation was accepted.ADEN— The Haushahi and the Alawi. 23 lie was granted an amnesty and his stipend, which had been stopped during the war, was restored to him. In January 1922 the troops of the Imam of Sanaa encroached on Hausliabi territory as far as Ad Dareija and only withdrew under pres sure of air action. In August 1922 Sultan Ali Mana died and was succeeded by his son, Muhsin bin Ali Mana. The Haushabi number about 15,000. The Sultan's gross annual revenue is estimated at lis. 30,000. (12) The Alawi. The district occupied by the Alawi tribe is situated between Haushabi and Quteibi territory. No separate engagement was entered into with this tribe after the capture of Aden, but the Shaikh's stipend was secured through, the intervention of Sultan Mana bin Salam of the O Haushabi tribe. In 1873 a body of Turkish troops marched through the Alawi country and compelled their Shaikh, Seif bin Shaif, who had refused to tender allegiance to the Turkish authorities at Taiz, to submit, and to surren der his son as a hostage. The latter was eventually released in consequ ence of the remonstrances of Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople. Shaikh Seif bin Shaif died in March 1875, and was succeeded by his nephew. Said bin Salih. The latter died on the 1st April 1892 and his eldest son, Shaikh Seif bin Said, was elected to the chief ship and was recognised by Government. The annual stipend of 60 dollars paid to the late Shaikh was continued to his successor. In 1888 Shaikh Said bin Salih signed an Agreement {see Appendix No. I) in conjunction with the Haushabi, Quteibi* and the Amiri* fixing the rates to be levied on merchandise. On the 16th July 1895 a Protectorate Treaty (No. LVII) was con cluded with the Alawi Shaikh. In April 1898 Shaikh Seif bin Said was deposed by his tribe. His cousin, Husein bin Salih, was elected Shaikh, but died the same year and was succeeded by Shaikh Ali Nasir Shaif, to whom the usual stipend was continued. 1904-1906, The Alawi Shaikh has ever remained loyal to the British Government. He was given assistance to build a fort at Hamra, where the Quteibi had held sway prior to the advent of the British. The Alawi-Quteibi relations have never been good. The chief bone of contention is the existence of co-rights in the village of Thumeir close * The Quteibi and Amiri are separate small tribes owing allegiance to the Amir of Dliala,24 ADEN— The Alawi. t s; I .;i- The Alawi Shaikh has a custom house and he is thus able to fore! , the lew of transit dues on the people of Thume.r m consulerat.ou of Xh they 'pay him revenue, whereas the power of the Qute.b. suiters from their having no right to levy dues.

The Quteibi Shaikh, who bad lost two of bis sons in the fighting, at first refused to come to terms with the Alawi; but a settlement was later effected by the Abdali Sultan, by which the whole of the Alawi Shaikh's country was restored to him. In 1914 the Alawi Shaikh Ali Nasir signed an Agreement (No. LVIII) practically identical with that signed about the same time by the Haushabi Sultan (No. LYI), for the safety of trade routes in his territory. The Agreement has not been ratified. Under the terms of this agreement the Alawi Shaikh was granted a monthly payment of 25 dollars in addition to his stipend and agreed to keep a force of 20 meu and to maintain a post at A1 Jimil. Since the agreement was signed the post of A1 Jimil has been demolished and A1 Jimil itself has passed into the hands of the Quteibi. In July 1920 Shaikh Ali Nasir died and was succeeded by his eldest son, Shaikh Abdun Nabi, to whom the payment of the stipend has been continued. In April 1923 Shaikh Abdun Nabi was arrested in his own country and taken to Nadira by a party of Imamic soldiers from Dhala. In spite of the protests sent to the Imam by the Resident at Aden, the Shaikh was detained till November 1924, when he was allowed to return to his country, which the Imam later occupied. In February 1928 Shaikh Abdun Nabi, with Shaikh Muqbil Abdulla, uncle of the Quteibi Shaikh, was kidnapped at the instigation of the Imamic authorities. They were subsequently released as a result of air action taken by His Majesty s Government against the Zeidi forces of occupation, and the Imam's troops in Alawi territory were expelled in July 1928. The Alawi number 1,000. Their gross annual revenue is estimated at lis. 3,000.ADEN— Amirate of Dhala. 25 (13) A miiiate of D hala. The group of tribes ruled over by the Amir of Dhala occupies the district north-west of the Alawi country on the high road to Sanaa. The ancestors of the present Amir are said to have been Muwallads, or half caste slaves of the Imams of Sanaa, and to have established themselves as independent at Dhala about the beginning of the last century. On the death in 1872 of the then Amir, Shafal bin Abdul Hadi, his nephew, Ali bin Muqbil, was recognised by the British Government as his successor. In the following year he was required by the Turkish authorities to make his submission to the Porte, a Turkish Superin tendent was appointed to Dhala,. a detachment of Turkish troops was quartered there, and the Amir was required to give a hostage for his good behaviour, who was to reside at Taiz. He was afterwards sum moned by the Turks to Qataba and imprisoned there, but effected his escape. Muhammad bin Musaid, who had been appointed Amir by the Turks in the place of his nephew Ali bin Muqbil, was killed, and his son, Abdulla bin Muhammad, was recognised by them as his successor. He continued to resist Ali bin Muqbil till 1878, when, Turkish support having been withdrawn from his rival, Ali bin Muqbil resumed his position as Amir of the tribes, with the loss, however, of several of his villages which had, some voluntarily and some under pressure, yielded allegiance to the Porte. In 1880 the Amir signed an Agreement (No. LIX) by which he became a British stipendiary, receiving 50 dollars a year. This allow ance was afterwards doubled. In September 1886 Ali bin Muqbil died, and was succeeded by his cousin, Shaif bin Seif, to whom the stipend was continued. In 1881 the Quteibi tribe became restless, and began to exact dues on the Hardaba route. In 1884 it was found necessary to support the Amir with a few sabres of the Aden troop and some sappers. They destroyed some of the Ahl-ath-Thumeiri forts, and the Quteibi then tendered their submission. But they soon resumed their independent position, and it was not until 1888, when the Resident met the Haushabi, the Dhala Amir and others to settle a schedule of rates (see Appendix No. I) to be levied on qafilahs, that the Quteibi and Ahl-ath-Thumeiri formally recognised the Amir as their superior. The years 1889 to 1900 were marked by the continued restlessness of the Quteibi, who failed to keep the settlements made in 1888, and by the encroachments of the Turks. In 1901 and the beginning of 1902, the Turks occupied Taleila, Mafari and Jebel Jehaf.26 ADEN—A mirate of Dhala. An Anglo-Turkisli boundarv commission met at Dhala in Fehruaiy 1902. The Turks claimed the whole of the Shairi, Jehel Jehaf and Mafari districts; but, after a year spent in correspondence between the British Government and the Porte, and the increase of the force accom- panving the British Commissioner, the Turkish garrisons were with drawn. In March 1903 an Trade was issued at Constantinople decreeing the commencement of the delimitation. By October the tioDiier had been demarcated, including on the British side th? Shaibi tribes, the Amiri villages in the AVadi As Safiya and the Humeidi and Ahmedi tribes. In Xovember 1903 successful operations were undertaken against the Quteibi who had attacked the po?t at As Suleik. In Xovember 1904 a further Treaty (Xo. LX was concluded with the Amir. Under clause IX of this Treaty the Amir agreed to keep a force of 50 men to help him to carry out his obligations under the Treaty for which he was granted a monthly payment of 100 dollars in addition to his stipend. In 1906 the Shairi rebelled against the Amir. They were joined bv the tribesmen of -lebel Jehaf. and some fighting ensued. The Ahmedi tribe on the river Tiban also became disaffected and refused to admit the Amir's suzerainty. In January 1907 the main body of British troops left Dhala for Aden. The remaining troops and the Political Agent, Dhala, were withdrawn in the following September. On the '22nd December 1911 Amir Shaif died and was succeeded by his eldest son. Xasr bin Shaif. to whom was continued the stipend paid to his father. In 191-3 the Quteibi Shaikh Muhammad Salih al Akhram signed ao Agreement (Xo. LXI) similar to those signed about the same time by the Haushabi Sultan Xo. LVI) and the Alawi Shaikh (Xo. LVIII) for the safety of the trade routes passing through hi- territory. The rati- tication of this agreement was postponed. I'nd?r the terms of this agreement the Shaikh was allowed a monthly payment of 50 dollars. On the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. Amii Xa&gt;r submitted to the Turks when they entered the Aden Protectorate. After the war he wrote asking for pardon. The Abdali Sultan and the Quteibi Shaikh also pleaded for him. He came to Aden in Xovember 1919 and gave an explanation which was accepted as satisfactory, and he was pardoned; but. while he was still in Aden, the Imam of Sanaa occupied Dhala. In January 1920 Amir Xasr. with the help of the Radfan tribes and with assistance in money, arms and ammunition from the Aden Residency, made an attack on Dhala and reovcupied it. but lost it on theADEN— Amirate of Dhala and the }Vahidi. 27 following day owing to a Zeidi counter-attack, the Amir taking refuge in Lahej. In 1920 His Majesty's Cxovernment increased tlie Amir's stipend to Rs. 700 and in 1926 to Es. 800, in compensation for liis financial losses due to his enforced exile. The extra hundred rupees, granted in 192G, ceased in February 1928, and the increase of Rs. 300 in his stipend, granted to him in 1920, ceased in December 1929. In 1920 the Imamic troops invaded the Quteibi country. The Quteibi Shaikh, with the help of other Radfan tribes and assistance in arms and ammunition from the Aden Residency, drove them out. The Zeidi made repeated attempts to take the Quteibi country, but invariably met with strong resistance from the Radfan tribes. After about two years of successful resistance, however, the Quteibi Shaikh yielded to Zeidi pressure and went over to them in 1922 and his stipend was stopped. In November 1927 the Quteibi Shaikh Muhammad Salih al Akhram died and was succeeded by his grandson Shaikh Hasan Ali, who repu diated his predecessor's submission to the Imam: and the stipend was restored to him by His Majesty's Government. In February 1928 a party of Zeidi, despatched under the orders of the Officer Commanding, Qataba, kidnapped the Alawi Shaikh and Muqbil Abdulla, uncle of the Quteibi Shaikh. They were subse quently released as a result of air action taken by His Majesty's Govern ment against the Imam. The air action had so shaken the morale of the Zeidi that a combina tion of the Radfan tribes, with the co-operation of the Royal Air Force and a contingent of Abdali troops, was able in July 1928 to drive them out of the Radfan areas, as also from Dhala and Shaib, The Amir of Dhala was immediately reinstated in his capital and the Zeidi have made no attempt to recapture these places (see Yemen narrative). The tribesmen of the Amir number about 50,000, and the gross revenue is estimated at Rs. 35,000 a year. (14) The Wahidi. The Wahidi are a Hadhramaut tribe. Their territory is bounded on the north and north-east by the lands of the Nam an and Buraishi tribes, on the north-west and west by the Upper Aulaqi, on the south-west by the Dhuyeibi, and on the south by the Arabian Sea. It has a sea-coast estimated at 50 miles in length, and includes the ports of Ras al Kalb, Bir Ali, Balahaf and Ras al Majdaha. The country may be divided into the three districts of Habban, Azzan and Bir Ali. This tribe had no dealings with the Aden Residency until, lin 1872, one of the Wahidi Sultans visited Aden: and uninterrupted com-28 ADEN— The Wahidi. munication has since l)e6n maintaiiiGd I)Gtweeii it and the Adeil Eesidency. In 1877 Sultan Ahmed bin Husein was dethroned, and was succeeded by his son, Salih bin Ahmed. In January 1878 several of the Wahidi Sultans addressed a joint letter to the Resident, complaining that negotiations were going on be tween the Qaiti Shaikh of Shihr and Thalab bin Hadi bin Thalab for the sale of the port of Bir Ali to the Qaiti. The Wahidi desired the Resident to close the port of Bir Ali and hoist the British flag at Balahaf until a settlement was effected. The Resident advised Thalak bin Hadi not to be so imprudent as to sell Bir Ali to the Qaiti. Sultan Salih bin Ahmed died in 1881, and was succeeded by his cousin, Abdulla bin Umar, as Sultan of Habban and Azzan. The latter visited Aden in 1881, and was received by the Resident. In the beginning of 1882 Izzat Pasha was appointed Turkish Governor-General of Yemen, and, on his way from Baghdad to Hodeida to take up his appointment, visited Balahaf and Bir Ali. No agreement of any kind was concluded between him and the Sultan of Balahaf; but Nasir bin Abdulla, one of the Sultans of Balahaf, apprehensive that Balahaf might be annexed by the Qaiti Shaikh of Shihr and Mukalla, obtained a Turkish flag, which was to be hoisted every Friday and on the approach of a foreign vessel. The Wahidi Sultan of Habban and Azzan, while denying all complicity in the matter, stated his inability to prevent the Sultans of Balahaf from flying the Turkish flag, and proclaimed his readiness to go against them with British aid. Subsequently the Wahidi Sultan and the Sultans of Bir Ali, Balahaf and Majdaha all wrote almost identical letters to the Resident, praying for British protection. From the correspondence which took place in connection with this incident, it appeared that the then Wahidi Sultan of Habban and Azzan had little, if any, control over Bir Ali, Balahaf and Majdaha. Abdulla bin Umar of Habban and Azzan was dethroned in 1885, when Hadi bin Salih of Balahaf was made the principal Sultan and the Wahidi were practically united under one ruler; though the title of Sultan continued to be borne by several subordinate Chiefs belonging to the ruling family. It was eventually decided to enter into closer relations with the Wahidi, and with this view Protectorate Treaties (Nos. LXII and LXIII), similar to that executed by the Sultan of Soqotra, were conclud ed in 1888 with the Sultans of Bir Ali and Balahaf. Annual stipends of 120 dollars each were at the same time granted to Sultan Muhsin bin Salih of Bir Ali and Sultan Hadi bin Salih of Balahaf.At) EN— the Wahidi 29 In 1892 Sultan Hadi bin Salih of Balaliaf resigned the Sultanate in favour of his younger brother, Muhsin bin Salih. The Government sanctioned this arrangement, and continued the stipend to Muhsin bin Salih. In 1893 Sultan Muhsin bin Salih of Bir Ali died, and was succeeded by Sultan Salih bin Ahmed, the usual annual stipend being continued to him. During this year Sultan Muhsin bin Salih of Balahaf displayed a refractory spirit and intrigued with foreign powers. He was driven from Habban by his tribesmen, but he still continued his intrigues, for participation in which his brother, Ahmed bin Salih, was imprisoned at Aden. In the meantime another of the Sultans of Balahaf, Salih bin Abdnlla, was elected Wahidi Sultan; but he was overawed by the Sultan's threats, and intimidated by the e^-Sultan's brother, Husein bin Salih, from hoisting the British flag. A small force was therefore sent to Balahaf in November 1894 in II. M. S. Bramble and the H. I. M. S. Dalhousie, which brought back Sultan Salih bin Abdulla oh a visit to the Resident and Husein bin Salih as a prisoner. In March 1895 a Protectorate Treaty (No. LXIV) wafe concluded with Sultan Salih bin Abdulla, by which his stipend was increased to 300 dollars. Hnsein bin Salih and Ahmed bin Salih were released. On the 1st June 1896 an amended Protectorate Treaty (No. LXV) was concluded with the Sultan of Bir Ali and his stipend increased to 360 dollars. During 1901 the Wahidi complained of Qaiti intrigues and asked for British protection. The Wahidi Shaikhs also requested that Muhsin bin Salih, the ^'-Sultan, might be recognised as titular chief; but their request was refused. In 1902 Muhsin bin Salih plundered a Qaiti sambuk containing specie. The Resident proceeded to Balahaf with a small force and, as Muhsin bin Salih failed to give up the plunder, the fort at Balahaf was demolished, and the Resident returned to Aden, bringing with him Sultan Ahmed bin Salih, Muhsin's brother, as a political prisoner. The port was closed against all shipping. In October the specie was restored, but it was not until December 1904 that Sultan Muhsin bin Salih came into Aden and tendered his submission, when he was forgiven his past misdeeds. His brother was released, and he was recognised as Sultan of the Wahidi of Balahaf in the place of Sultan Salih bin Abdulla, who had proved himself a Weak and inefficient ruler and had gained the disapprobation of his tribe and the censure of Government by an attempt to part with his share of the port of Balahaf to the Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla. On the occasion of Sultan Muhsin's recognition the oppor tunity was taken to reaffirm with him the Protectorate Treaty of 1895 {see No. LXIV).ADEN— The Wahidi and the Kathiri. 30 » ma £ ™ «■ W -m.

Sultan Muhsin died in January 1919 and was succeeded by his younger son Ali bin Muhsin bin Salih (who, with bis brother Abdulla, resigned his'appointment in the 1st Yemen Infantry) to whom the Gov ernment of India continued the monthly stipend of 30 dollars paid to his father. In 1930 Sultan Ali bin Muhsin became mentally deranged and though still nominally the Chief of the tribe, his brother, Abdulla, acts for him. (15) T he K atiiim. The country inhabited by this tribe was formerly extensive, reaching from the Aulaqi districts on the west to the Mahri tribe on the east, and including the seaports of Mukalla and Shihr. Civil wars led to the interference of the Yafai, and much of the Kathiri territory came under the sway of the Kasadi and Qaiti, the Kathiri now possessing no seaport at all. Some account of the tribe will be found under ' (1(1) Sultanate of Mukalla ''. At the end of 1883 Sultan Abdulla bin Salih, one of the Kathiri Shaikhs, visited the Resident at Aden. His principal object was to ascer tain what attitude the British Government would maintain in the event of the Kathiri attacking the Qaiti with a view to repossessing themselves of the ports of Shihr and Mukalla. Abdulla bin Salih also visited Zanzibar with intent to intrigue with the e.t'-jNTaqib of Mukalla, from whom, however, he failed to obtain any material assistance.rx (2 ADEN— The Kathiri and Sultanate of Mukalla. 31 Tlie Government of India in Marcli 1884 directed tliat the Katliiri be warned that an attack upon Shihr and Mukalla would be viewed with grave displeasure, and that, if necessary, a g-un-boat would be sent to support the Qaiti ruler. The Jamadar of Shihr and Mukalla was subse quently assured in the most public manner that Government would support him in the event of any attack on his ports. In 1895 the Kathiri captured the fort at Dhufar driving out the Governor, who retired to Marbat. In 1897 the port was recaptured. In 1918 a long standing- Qaiti-Kathiri quarrel was settled, with the assistance of the Aden Residency, by the conclusion of an Agreement (ISTo. LXVI) between the parties, by which the Kathiri agreed to accept as binding upon them the treaty of 1888 between the Qaiti and the British Government and also accepted the arbitration of the British Government in the settlement of future disputes. Sultan Mansur bin Ghalib died at Mecca in May 1929 and was succeeded by his son Ali bin Mansur. (16) S ultanate of M ukalla. Shihr and Mukalla are the two principal ports of the Hadhramaut region. The whole region was, till some 400 years ago, in the pos session of the Kathiri; but, towards the close of the fifteenth century , disputes having arisen among the members of the ruling family, one of the claimants, Amr bin Badr, called in the Yafai, who, in return for their assistance in putting him in power, retained for themselves the ports of Shihr and Mukalla. Mukalla was till lately retained by one of their sub-tribes, the Kasadi; both places are now, however, in the possession of the head of another sub-tribe, the Qaiti (Qa 'iti). Shihr and Mukalla were at one time centres of an active traffic in slaves from Zanzibar and the Dankali coast. In May 1863 Brigadier Coghlan, the Political Resident at Aden, concluded an Engagement (No. LXYIT) with Sialih bin Muhammad of the Kasadi sub-division of the Yafai tribe, Naqib of Mukalla, in which he agreed to abolish and prohibit the export and import of slaves. A precisely similar engage ment was concluded on the same date with Ali bin Naji, of the Qaiti sub-division of the same tribe, Naqib of Shihr. In 1866 Sultan Ghalib bin Muhsin, Shaikh of the Kathiri, expelled Ali bin Naji from Shihr and took possession of the fort. At this time the inland town of Shibam was held by the Qaiti tribe: and their Shaikh, Abdulla, being apprehensive that the capture of Mukalla would follow that of Shibr, and that his communication with the seaboard would be cut off. applied to his brothers, in the service of the Hyderabad State, for assistance against Sultan Ghalib bii?

A request was XT EADEN— The Sultanate of Mukalla. thereupon preferred by the Minister of the Xizani foi tlie armed inter- ference of the British Grovernment on behalf of ihe iig^litful Temadar of Shihr. Government, however, declined to interfere or to allow an armed expedition to be fitted out by Arabs from the Indian coast. In April 1867 Awadh (Awaz) bin Umar, better known by his Hyderabad title of Sultan Nawaz Jang, a brother of the Qaiti Jemadar Abdulla, after establishing a blockade on the sea-coast, landed near Shihr, attacked and put to flight Sultan Ghalib bin Muhsin, and estab lished the authority of his brother as Jemadar of Shihr. An attempt was made by the Kathiri Shaikh in December of the same year to retake the place, but he was repulsed by the Qaiti, who have since remained in unmolested possession of the port and district. Application was made by the Kathiri Shaikh to the British Government for permission to recover Shihr by force, but it was considered undesirable to interfere. At the same time the Nizam's Minister declared his readiness to prohibit any interference on the part of Hyderabad subjects in the affairs of Hadhramaut. Salih bin Muhammad died in 1873 shortly after the conclusion of a Treaty (No. LXVIII) with him, by which he engaged for himself, his heirs and successors, to prohibit the import or export of slaves to or from Mukalla and its dependencies. He was succeeded as Naqib by his son, Umar bin Salih, who accepted tan offer by the Qaiti Jemadar of Shihr to aid him in reducing the refractory Shaikh of Duan. Taking • • • ^ advantage of his admission with 600 followers into the fort of Mukalla, the Qaiti Jemadar demanded payment of a debt alleged to have been due to him by the late Naqib. Finding himself powerless to resist this demand, the Naqib consented to a treaty* under which he agreed to cede one-half of Mukalla, of Bandar Burum, and of the district of Al- Harshiyyat in return for a payment of 2|- lakhs of dollars, from which, however, the debt due to the Qaiti Jemadar was to be deducted. But hostilities continued: the Naqib entered into an alliance with the Kathiri, and the Qaiti, with the aid of their relatives at Hyderabad, purchased a vessel and despatched her to Aden. There she was detained under the provisions of the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870, .uul not released until the Qaiti Jemadar had bound himself under a he n \ penalty to send her at once to Bombay without touching at, or undertaking am operations against, any of the ports of Hadhramaut.

For the plunder of three such vessels he was compelled to pay an indemnity of Es. 6,142 and rained of the consequences of such interference with commerce in the future.vith ADEN— The Sultanate of Mule alia. 33 In 1873 an Engagement (No. LXTX) was concluded witli the Jemadar of Shilir, by which he bound himself, his heirs and successors, to pro hibit the import or export of slaves to or from Shihr and its dependencies. The British Government steadily avoided interference or arbitration in the disputes between the Naqib of Mukalla and the Jemadar of Shihr, and took no action regarding them beyond asking for assurances from the ministers of the Hyderabad State that persons in the service of the Xizam, who might be convicted of taking part in the quarrel by supplying money and munitions of war to their relatives on either side, and so prolonging the strife, would be dismissed. But at length, in 1876, there being no prospect of the cessation of hostilities without some authoritative interference, the Political Resident at Aden, acting under the authority of Government, visited the two chiefs, and through his mediation a truce for two years was concluded, on the expiry of which period a further extension of one year was arranged. Xo permanent settlement was however effected, and eventually hostilities were resumed in 1880 and resulted in the capture of Burum by the Jemadar of Shihr. Being driven to extremities the INTaqib of Mukalla signed the agreements drawn up by the Political Resident, and Burum was evacuated by the Jemadai of Shihr. Xo sooner was the Xaqib thus relieved from immediate pressure than he repudiated the terms of the settlement. The Government of India thereupon directed that the Jemadar should be replaced in possession of Burum, which was surrendered by the Naqib without further bloodshed. Finally, in November 1881, the latter gave himself up to the Commander of H. M. S. Dragon and was conveyed with his dependants to Aden, while the Jemadar of Shihr was put in possession of Mukalla and its dependencies. From Aden the e,r -Naqib went to Zanzibar with a num ber of Shaikhs and followers, and in 1888 he accepted the maintenance provided for him. In 1882 an Engagement (No. LXX) was concluded with the Jemada.r of Shihr and Mukalla by which he became a British stipendiary, an allowance of '360 dollars a year being assigned to him, his heirs and successors. At the same time the Jemadar paid over (article 2) a sum of 100,000 dollars to the Resident at Aden for the maintenance of the e^-Naqib of Mukalla. On the 1st May 1888 a Protectorate Treaty (No. LXXI) was con cluded with the Jemadar Abdulla bin Umar, and his brother Awadh bin Umar. Jemadar Abdulla bin TJmar died on the 25th November 1888, and Government sanctioned the continuance of the salute and stipend to his brother Awadh bin Umar (Sultan Nawaz Jang). In 1896 a quarrel took place between Jemadar Awadh bin Umar and his nephews, Ilusein and Munassar, over their right of succession and e 2 ■ADEN—T/ie Sultanate of Mukalla. 34 the division of their property. In September 1901 the Resident tried to bring about a settlement, but failed. A further conference at Ader in February 1902 was no more successful. Jemadar Awadh bm Tlmar went to India to lay his petition before the Viceroy, while his nephews returned to Shihr after signing a pledge not to mterlere with the administration of their country. The agreement was broken, and m June the Resident, accompanied by Jemadar Awadh bm I mar, went to Shihr with an armed force. Husein submitted and was brought to Aden, Munassar following him shortly afterwards. The settlement of the dispute between Awadh bin TTmar and his nephews was then submitted to arbitration, which resulted in the award of a large sum of money to Tlusein and Munassar and theii families. The}, however, refused to accept the award and in July 1904 left for India and so far (December 1930) the dispute about the nephews Tiust money has not been settled. In 1902 a permanent salute of 9 guns was sanctioned for the Jemadar of Shihr and Mukalla, and his title was changed from Jemadar to Sultan. At the end of 1904 the Sultan purchased a share in the port of Balahaf from the Wahidi Sultan Salih bin Abdulla, but Government refused to sanction the agreement. In 1906 the Sultan's nephew Munassar, writing to report the death of his brother Husein, unsuccessfully endeavoured to re-open the question of his differences with the Sultan. The Qaiti-Wahidi Agreement of 1910 (Appendix No. Ill), by which the Wahidi Sultan allowed passage through his territory to the Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla, has already been mentioned under The Wahidi. In December 1910 Sultan Awadh bin Umar died, leaving a will nomi nating his eldest son Ghalib as his successor and directing that Ghalih's successor was to be his brother Umar bin Awadh, to whom Ghalib bin Awadh's son Salih was to succeed, and so on, the succession alternating between the families of his two sons Ghalib bin Awadh and Vmar bin Awadh. In accordance with the terms of this will Ghalib succeeded as Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla, and the stipend paid to his father was continued to him. In 1916 the Sultan sent to Aden his minister Khan Bahadur Sayyid ITusein bin Hamid el Mehdar to discuss the question of his suzerainty over the Iladhramaut. Sayyid Husein produced a draft agreement in regard to the future status and administration of Balahaf and the other Wahidi territories, which the Sultan proposed to sign with the Saltan of Balahaf and his brothers, subject to the approval of Government. Sayyid Husein asserted that the Sultan had concluded acrreements withADEN— The Sultanate of Mukalla and Soq,otra and Qishn. 35 'i Tf| certain tribes of tlie Hadliramaut, of which he was anxious to obtain Government recognition: and asked that, in the event of this being accorded, the tribes should not be allowed direct intercourse with the Aden Residency. The Government of India explained that, though they had no desire to raise any objection to the agreement which the Sultan had arrived at with Sultan Muhsin and his brothers, they pre ferred to defer their decision with regard to this, as well as the other agreements with the inland tribes, until normal conditions were established. The composition, in 1918, of the long standing quarrel between the Qaiti and the Kathin (No. LX\ I) has already been mentioned in the Kathiri section. Sultan Ghalib died at Hyderabad in June 1922, leaving a will by which he nominated his son Salih as his successor. Salih at first claimed the succession, but finally came to an agree ment with his uncle in accordance with the terms of his grandfather's will by which Umar bin Awadh was to succeed as Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla while acknowledging Salih bin Ghalib as his heir. In 1923 the succession of Sultan Umar was recognized by His Majesty's Government, and the payment of the monthly stipend of -30 dollars was continued to him. In the same year he was granted a personal salute of 11 guns. The Sultan's tribesmen, including Bedouins, number about 60,000, and his gross annual revenue is estimated at lis. 6,25,000. (IT) SOQOTEA AND QlSHN. The island of Soqotra lies about 150 miles off Cape Guardafui on the African coast and 500 miles from Aden. The sovereignty of the island is invested in the Ahl Afrir family of the Mahri tribe of Arabs, who inhabit Qishn on the mainland. The connection of the British Government with Soqotra commenced in 1834, when Captain Ross, of the Indian Navy, was sent on a mission to Soqotra, and concluded an Agreement (No. LXXI1) with Sultan Ahmed bin Sultan of Fartash and his cousin. Sultan bin Amr of Qishn, by which they consented to the landing and storage of coal on the island by the British Government. In 1835 negotiations were undertaken through Commander Haines with the Sultan, Amr bin Saad Tawari, for the purchase of the island, and in anticipation of their success a detachment of European and Indian troops was sent to take possession. The Sultan, however, refused to sell the island, or even to cede a portion of it as a coaling depot, and the troops were withdrawn.36 ADEN— Soqotra and Qishn and Yemen. In 1888 the Chief proposer! to farm the island to the British Govern ment, but the capture of Aden, while the proposal was under discussion, rendered it unnecessary to secure Soqotra as a coaling station. Sultan Amr Inn Saad Tawari died about 1845, and was succeeded in the Sultanate of Soqotra and Qishn by his nephew, Tawari bin Ali, who in turn was succeeded by his grandson, Ahmed bin Saad. The latter was succeeded by his nephew, Abdulla bin Saad, who was followed by his cousin, Abdulla bin Salim. On the death of the latter he was succeeded hy his son, Ali. In January 187G an Agreement (No. LXXIII) was concluded with the Sultan of Soqotra and Qishn, by which, in consideration of a pay ment of 3,000 dollars and an annual subsidy of 360 dollars, he bound himself, his heirs and successors, never to cede, sell, mortgage, or other wise give for occupation, save to the British Government, the island of Soqotra or any of its dependencies, the neighbouring islands. In 1886 he accepted (No. LXXIY) a Protectorate Treaty, and bound himself to abstain from all dealings with foreign powers without the previous sanction of the British Government. At the same time he undertook to give immediate notice to the Resident at Aden or other British officer of any attempt by any other power to interfere with Soqotra and its dependencies. In 1888 a similar Protectorate Treaty (No. LXXV) was concluded with Sultan Ali bin Abdulla, as head of the Mahri tribe, and his annual stipend was increased by 120 dollars. In 1898 some of the cargo of the P. and O. S. S. Aden wrecked off Soqotra was plundered, and the Sultan had to be reminded of his obli gations under the Agreement of 1876. Sultan Ali bin Abdulla had three sons, all of whom predeceased him. He died in 1907 and was succeeded by Sultan Abdulla bin Isa, to whom was continued the annual stipend paid to his predecessor. The area of the island of Soqotra is about 1,000 square miles; its population, mostly Bedouin, is probably about 12,000. The gross annual revenue is estimated at Es. 1,000. The Sultan of Soqotra and Qishn receives a salute of 9 guns, which was made permanent in 1902. (18) Yemen. About the beginning of the seventeenth centnry, the English obtained a firman from the Governor of Mocha for the establishment of a factorv and permission to trade on payment of a duty on goods, not exceeding 3 per cent, f his deed was confirmed by the Turkish Pasha of Yemen. About the same time the Dutch established a factory at Mocha, whichADEN— Y emen. 37 was then the great depot for the trade of soiithern Arabia, and a century later a factory was also opened by the French. After the expulsion of the Turks in 1630 the whole of Yemen came under the rule of the Imams of Sanaa; but at the time of Carsten Niebuhr's visit to Sanaa in 1763, the native Arab tribes of the provinces of Aden, Abu Arish, Taiz and others, had thrown off allegiance to the Imams. In 1799, when the British Government took measures to oppose the expected invasion of India by the French and to revive the lost trade of the Red Sea, Dr. Pringle was deputed to Sanaa with presents from the Governor- General, and obtained from the Imam, Ali Mansur, orders to the Governors of Mocha, Ilodeidah and Loheiyya to give everv facility to trade. Two years afterwards an effort was made by Sir Home Popham, Ambassador to the States of Arabia, to negotiate a commercial treaty with Sanaa; but he was treated with indignity by the Governor of Mocha, and the terms of the proposed treaty were rejected by the Imam. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Imam Ali Mansur suffered severely at the hands of the Wahhabis, who overran and wrested from him some of the best districts of his dominions. In 1816, however, Muhammad Ali Pasha destroyed the TV ahhabi power and restored these districts to Ahmed, the son and successor of Imam Ali Mansur, in consi deration of an annual tribute of 100,000 dollars. Ahmed was succeeded in 1817 by his son, Abdulla, who was unable to retain the provinces which had been restored to his father. In 1817, in consequence of a dispute in which an Arab had been temporarily detained at the factory at Mocha, the British Residency was attacked and plundered, and a British officer was subjected to insult by the Governor. After some delay a British squadron was sent to demand satisfaction for this outrage. On the 26th December 1820 the fort of Mocha was taken, and shortly afterwards a public apology was made for the indignity offered to the British Government, and a Treaty (No. LXXVI) was signed by the Imam of Sanaa and his Council, in 1821, defining the rights to be enjoyed by British subjects, and reducing the export duty on goods to 2\ per cent. This Treaty was carelessly framed and it was afterwards discovered that serious discrepancies existed between the English and Arabic versions. The Imam refused to accept any modification of the latter. To preserve friendly relations, the British Government yielded every point, except a clause in the English version of the 0th article, stipulating that the servants of the factory should be amenable only to the jurisdiction of the Resident. This was altogether omitted in the Arabic version. The Imam was informed that all other points were conceded, but that, if he attempted to seize or punish any person, of whatever nation, in the exclusive employment of the Resident, the Resident would withdraw, and such further measures would be adopted as might seem expedient to the British Government.38 ADEN— Yemen. For many years the country of Sanaa was in a state of anarchy. In 1832 Mocha and all the sea-coast fell under the suzerainty of the Turks; and when, in 1840, a Commercial Treaty (No. LXXVII) was concluded with Sharif Husein bin Ali, Governor of Mocha, by Captain Moresby, it became a matter of doubt whether the Governor had any right to conclude a treaty as a principal. Moreover, some of its provisions were not approved by the British Government, and others were not ob served by the Sharif. The matter Avas referred to Constantinople, where the dispute was amicably adjusted; but the Treaty was never ratified. Ali Mansur, who succeeded his father as Imam of Sanaa in 1834, was deposed three years after. He again succeeded to power in 1844, on the death of his uncle, only to be once more deposed in 1845 by Muhammad Yahya, a distant relative of the family. Mocha and the coast, which had been recovered by the Imam from the Turks for a time, were finally lost in 1848. Muhammad \ahya, in 1849, swore allegiance to the Porte, and agi eed to hold Sanaa as a vassal of the Sultan, paying to him half the re\enues and receiving a Turkish garrison in his capital. This so incensed the inhabitants that they rose against the Turks, massacred them, and reinstated Ali Mansur, who ordered Muhammad Yahya to be put to death. Within a few months Imam Ali Mansur fell into the hands of Ghalib, the son of Muhammad \ ahya, who contented himself with con fiscating his property. The people of Sanaa, however, refused to acknowledge the authority of Ghalib, and elected a governor. Shaikh Ahmed Ali Khemiah, from among their own body. Ghalib led a pro fligate life m an obscure village a few miles from Sanaa till 1858, when he was recalled and reinstated in the government with the title of A1 Hadi, but with merely nominal power. During the internal revolutions m Sanaa and the desultory warfare with the Turks, the Imams repeatedly endeavoured to enlist the aid and advice of the British Government who owever, rigidly abstained from all interference in their affairs. In I8 56 , nevertheless, when the Beni Asir tribe marched against Hodeidah with a strong force, they were deterred from attacking it by the presence of two British ships which had been sent there for the purpose of P J 0 +l!

Hasan Edib Pasha was appointed to be Governor-General in June 1891. A rebellion which took place in the course of the year was put down by Ottoman troops. The withdrawal of the Turks from Arabia in 1919 procured for the Imam of Sanaa a state of complete independence. He re-established his authority over the greater part of the Yemen, and began to encroach on the Aden Protectorate which he claimed to have been a part of his domains from ancient times. By 1925 he was in possession of all the territories of the Amir of Dhala and of the Radfan tribes, of Shaib, Nawa, lUibiatein and Dabiani which are appendages of the Upper Yafai, of Beidha, (an independent confederation inside the demarcated line), and of the greater part of the Audhali country. In 192G Sir Gilbert Clayton was deputed by His Majesty's Government to endeavour to conclude a treaty with the Imam, but the negotiations failed. The Imam's attempts at further encroachment on the Protectorate continued until, in February 1928, the Alawi Shaikh Abdun Nabi bin Ali Nashir, and Muqbil Abdulla uncle of the Quteibi Shaikh, were kidnapped by his forces. In March 1927 the Imam had been warned by His Majesty's Govern ment that he would lay himself open to retaliatory measures if he made further encroachments on the Protectorate. In spite of this warning, a large force of Imamic regular and irregular troops invaded the Subeihi territory in September 1927, burning and looting as far as the neighbour hood of Turan, but retired as a result of warnings to the effect that they would be bombed if they did not evacuate the invaded area within 48 hours. The Imam was again warned that, in the event of further raids, air action would be taken immediately against his towns of Qataba, Ibb, Taiz and other places within his territory. The kidnapping of the Shaikhs referred to above was therefore the culminating point that ren dered immediate concerted action against him essential. Bombing operations were accordingly carried out and resulted in the release of these two Shaikhs. The bombing operations had so shaken the morale of the Imam's troops that a combination of the Radfan tribes, in co operation with a contingent of Abdali troops and the Royal Air Force, was able to expel the Zeidi from, and recover, all the territory which they had hitherto occupied, with the exception of Nawa, Rubiatein and Dabiani and part of the Audhali country. The Imam has made no attempt to resume his incursions into the Protectorate.40 ADEN— Idrisi. (19) T he I dejsi. Between 1830 and 1840 the Abu Arisli, one of tiie leading tribes in Asir, which at one time ruled over the whole of Asir and ia part of the coastal region up to Hodeidah, was governed by a certain Sharif Ali, who made terms with the Egyptians. During his reign, one Sayyid Ahmed el Idrisi, a native of Fez and head of a religious fraternity school (tariqah), whose tenets he had been preaching at Mecca since 1799, acquired land at Sabia, where he settled and died in 1837. He had been the teacher of the original Senussi Shaikh, who had taken the coven ant in his tariqah at Mecca in 1823. The Idrisi family increased in wealth during the life-time of Ahmed's son and grandson, and appears, after the renunciation of Asir by the Egyptians in 1841, to have sup planted the Sharifial family of Abu Arish. It inter-married with the Senussi house, which was now settled in Cyrenaica: and, through branches at Zeinia, near Luxor in Egypt, and in the Sudan at Argo (Arju), it extended its influence. 13ut the expansion of its temporal power at home, to include the Tihama north and south and a suzerainty over several tribes outside those limits, (e.g., in the Sada District of North Yemen, even over the Qahtan tribes), is the work of Sayyid Ahmed's great-grandson, Sayyid Muhammad bin Ali. Sayyid Muhammad bin Ali was born in 1876 in Sabia. At the age of 20 years he left for Egypt and stayed there about 12 years, during which time he was educated at the Azhar and by the Senussi and had married two wives. He returned to Sabia in 1908, determined to assert the complete independence of all Asir. If he was not at first as sue- cessful as he promised to be, he effectually divided the Turks in Hejaz from those in Yemen, and was sovereign in Asir. In 1915 a Treaty of friendship (No. LXXVIII) was concluded with ^ayyid Muhammad bin Ali. Its main object was to war against the Turks, and it is held to have now expired. In January 1917, after the capture of Earsan Islands by the Idrisi from the Turks, a supplementary Agreement (No. LXXIX) was con cluded with him recognising the Islands as forming part of the Idrisi's domains and promising protection against Foreign Powers: an expres sion which, it has been held, does not include Arabian Rulers. In 1919, after the evacuation of Asir and Tihama by the Turks, the Idrisi's influence extended as far as Birq in the north and Zeidiya in the south. In August 1919 a British mission to the Imam of Sanaa, under Lieutenant-Colonel H. F. Jacob, was detained at Bajil by the Quhra tribe who wore led to believe that the chief object of the mission was to make them over to the Imam. After prolonged negotiations with the QuhraADEN— Idrisi. tribe for their release, and with, the help of the Irlrisi, the mission was allowed to return to Aden in December 1919. Shortly after this an Imamic force attacked the Quhra who appealed to the Idrisi for help. The latter espoused their cause and for over three years successfully resisted the advance of the Imamic troops cn the Quhra frontier. In flanuary 1921 Hodeidah, which was occupied by British troops on the declaration of tiie Armistice, was evacuated and was occupied by the Idrisi. In 1923 Sayyid Muhammad bin Ali died. The Idrisi tribes elected his eldest son Ali, aged about 16 years, to succeed him under the tutelage of Ms paternal uncle Sayyid Hasan el Idrisi. The youth soon got out of the control of his uncle and his cousin, Sayyid Mustafa (who was the ruling spirit in the Idrisi country and who had been the chief adviser of Sayyid Muhammad bin Ali in establishing relations with the Uritish Government), and appointed men of no importance as his councillors. Attempts made by Sayyid Hasan's party to depose the young Idrisi proved unsuccessful, with the result that fighting broke out between the supporters of Sayyid Ali and Sayyid Hasan, resulting in the defeat of the latter. In the circumstances Sayyid Mustafa was compelled to leave the country, and returned to Egypt. Subsequently Sayyid Ali deported all the councillors of his father and so weakened himself by this and other ill-advised acts, that the Imam of Sanaa was able to occupy unopposed all the maritime plain from Hodeidah to Medi, which the Idrisi had acquired as the result of the Great War. In 1925 the Idrisi tribes, tired of Sayyid Ali's misrule, deposed him and elected Sayyid Hasan in his place. In October 192(j Sayyid Hasan concluded an agreement with Bin Sand placing his country under the suzerainty of the latter.ADEN— The Abdali —NO. 11—1802. 53 No. II.

Whatever plunder may take place upon our subjects on the coast, I will call upon Syud Alowi, and the Governor of Aden has the interposition. If God should decree a quarrel, between the Fadhlee and the Abdalees, each would know his own friend, and the English should not interfere amongst Arabs. Each would go on according to his rule and covenant, and if anyone should try to make mischief betwixt us (Fadhlee and English), the saying of such enemies must not be listened to. The Governor of Aden should abolish the invention which they have estab lished at the gate of Aden upon the poor of our subjects and others ; for the sake of the good condition of the needy, we and the English are friends upon sincerity and good-will between them and us and protection for our said friends (subjects).

Written on 27th Shaaban, 1336, In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. God has said in his Holy Book ' Ye are the noblest people that have been brought forth for the world, that ye may enjoin the doing of kindnesses, forbid the commission of that which is unlawful, and believe in God. 1 Again he saith ; ' As for those who, when we have enabled them to do so, in the world, perform their prayers, give alms, enjoin the doing of kindnesses, and forbid the commis sion of that which is unlawful, behold the requital of all things is in the hands of God.' Behold, praise be to God, we believe in Him, we follow the guidance of our Prophet (upon whom be blessing and peace) and we believe in (combina tion to effect) whatsoever shall bring benefits to Moslems, the good of mankind and the country—desiring whatsoever may bring security and peace to the people and their well-being both within and without the country. For that reason, the noble Qaiti governments and the family of Abdallah have signed a treaty together in perpetuity until the raven shall turn white and the earth shall fade away—the two parties being the Sultan Sir el Ghalib bin Awab bin Omar and Omar bin Awad bin Omar el Qaiti—contracting on their own behalf and that of their heirs and successors, and of those who have commissioned them on the one hand ; and the Sultans Mansur bin Ghalib, and Muhsin bin Ghalib of the family of Abdallah contracting on 'their own behalf and that of their heirs and successors and those who have commissioned them, on the other hand, i he following are the conditions they have laid down : .1 The Qaiti Sultan, lord of A1 Shahr and A1 Mukalla, and the Sultans of the family of Abdallah al Kathiri recognise that the province of Hadramaut shall be one province, the said province being an appanage of the British liiinpire under the Sultan of Al Shahr and Mukalla. II. The Qaiti Sultan lord of Al Shahr and Al Mukalla acknowledges that the Sultans of the family of Abdallah are Sultans of Al Shanafir, but the family of Abdallah rule within Hadramaut over the towns and villages of Siwun, Tcrim, Teris, Al Gharaf, Mariana and Al Gheil. Ib is acknowledged that the sub-tribes of Shanafir mentioned as follows shall be under the Sultan of the family of Ab dallah namely the tribes of Omar and Aamir ; the sub-tiibes of Al Kathiri, Al Awamir, Bag-iri and Gabiri and all that is within their boundaries, as it) well known and recognised. III. The Qaiti Sultan lord of Al Shahr and Al Mukalla contracts on his own behalf and of his heirs and successors on the one hand, that he acknowledges and recognises the rights and suzerainty of the Sultans of the family of Abdallah and their heirs and successors over the said towns and villages as well as the sub-tribe of Shanafir aforenamed in Article II above ; and also that he will not mterfeie158 ADEN—Ka/hiri—NO.

The Sultans of the Abdallah family admit on their own behalf and that of their heirs and successors on the other hand, that they will net interfere in any way soever with the Government of Hadramaut, with the exception of the towns and villages aforenamed in Article II and likewise the sub-tube named in the said Article ; and agree that they have no power to interfere in any other places. V. The Abdallah Sultans acknowledge and recognise that the treaty signed between the British Government and the Qaiti Government in 1888 is binding upon them, just as if they had themselves made it, and they agree to conform to its conditions faithfully. They further recognise that all their negotiations and correspondence with the British Government shall be carried on throufh the Qaiti Sultan Lord of A1 Shahr and Al Mukalla. VI. Both parties agree to suppress disorders both now and in future, imme diately ; they agree to forgive and forget all that has passed and to renounce severally all vendetta or claims for compensation ; they agree to preserve in future security on the roads existing within their well-known frontiers, to enforce jus tice according to the Sheria and respect for the higher authority, to succour the oppressed and to maintain the common law within the stated boundary VII. The aforesaid agree to give each other mutual assistance in case of any transgression committed by either of the two parties against their subjects or friends or any persons connected with them, or against a sherif, a wayfarer or any defenceless person. They agree mutually to defend life and property, as well as their tollowers and subjects and any who seek their hospitality, as long as the boundaries named shall endure ; they further agree to treat them with the same jusUce and equity that they show towards their friends.

Treaty with the Idrisi,—1915. This Treaty of Friendship and Goodwill is signed by Major-General D. G. L Shaw, the Political Resident, Aden, on behalf of the British Government, and by Sayed Mustafa bin Sayed Abdul Ali on the part of His Eminence Saiyid Muham mad biii Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idris, the Idrisi Saiyid and Amir of Sabia and its environments. 2. Its main objects are to war against the Turks and to consolidate a pact of friendship between the British Government and the Idrisi Saiyid, abovemen- tioned and his Tribesmen. 3. The Idrisi Saiyid agrees to attack and to endeavour to drive the Turks from their stations in the Yemen and to the best of his power to harass the Tur kish troops in the direction of the Yemen, and to extend his territories at the expense of the Turks. 4. The Saiyid's prime objective will be against the Turks only, and he will abstain from any hostile or provocative action against Imam Yahya so long as the latter does not join hands with the Turks. 5. The British Government undertakes to safeguard the Idrisi Saiyid's terri tories from all attack on the seaboard from any enemy who may molest him ; to guarantee his independence in his own domain and at the conclusion of the war to use every diplomatic means in its power to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi Saiyid and the Imam Yahya or any other rival. 6. The British Government has no desire to enlarge its borders in Western Arabia, but wishes solely to see the various Arab Rulers living peacefully and amicably together each in his own sphere, and all in friendship with the British Government. 7. As a mark of its appreciation of the work to be performed by the Idrisi Saiyid, the British Government has aided him with both funds and munitions and will continue to assist him in the prosecution of the war so long as it lasts in accordance with the measures of the Idrisi's activities. 8. Finally, while maintaining a strict blockade on all Turkish ports in the Red Sea, the British Government has for some months past been giving the Idrisi Saiyid full and free scope to trade and traffic between his ports and Aden, and this concession the British Government in token of the friendship existing will continue uninterruptedly to maintain. 9. This Treaty will be held to be valid after its ratification by the Government of India.

THE whole of (he northeni shore of the Persian (xiilf belongs to 1 eisia. That portion of the coast which extends from below Mohammerah to tire shrine of Shah Abul Shah, near Bandar Dilam, is inhabited mainly by Chaab Arabs and their dependents. The Chaab country, as well as the districts of Mohammerah, Shatt-al-Arab and Kamn, was under the immediate jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Mohammerah \\ho, in addition to his de jure position as Governor, was de facto hereditary rulei, under the Shah of Persia, of the locally autonomous district of Moham merah. Shaikh Khazal Khan, however, defied the Government and in April 1925 his heritage was confiscated and he himself arrested and car ried to Tehran, where he has since been detained as a political prisoner. The Persian coastal tract is now administered by the Persian Govern ment; from Mohammerah to Shah Abul Shah inclusive through the Governor-General of Khuzistan, and from thence on to Bushire through the Governor of all the Ports and Islands in the Persian Gulf, whose jurisdiction extends down to Chahbar. Both these officials hold their appointments under the Ministry of the Interior, and are in control of subordinate governorships which administer outlying portions of teni- tories included in the respective major appointments. The port of Bandar Abbas was held in farm by the Sultans of Muscat from 1798 till 1853, when the Shah of Persia resumed possession of Bandar Abbas and its dependencies; but he restored Ihem to Saiyid Said in 1856, though on much less advantageous terms than formerly. The rent was raised from 6,000 to 16,000 tomans a year, and the islands of Hormuz and Qishm, the hereditary possessions of the Sultans of Muscat, were ( 181 )182 PERSIAN GULF. ceded to Persia.* On the death of Saiyid Thuwaini and succession of his son ,Saiyid Salmi in 18g0, the Persian (government appeared at first inclined to renew the lease of Bandar Abbas to Saiyid Salim, but at an increased rent and on the condition that his uncle Saiyid Turki should be appointed Governor. Subsequently, however, on the ground that Saiyid Salini, as grandson of Saiyid Said, could not continue to hold under a lease granted, as it was alleged, only to Saiyid Said and his sons ,t the I ersian Government renewed the lease at an enhanced rate of 20 000 tomans in favour of the former Arab Governor Shaikh Said, a relation of the Muscat family, not as a representative of Muscat, but'as a direct dependent of Persia. Throughout the winter of 18g7 Saiyid Salim was too much occupied in securing himself in the government of Muscat to be able to give his attention to the former dependencies of his family on the northern shore of the Persian Gulf. Meantime Shaikh Said refused to pay the balance of tribute due by him to Persia, and preparations were made for coercing him. In April 1808, however, Saiyid Salim threatened o uockade Bandar Abbas unless the lease was renewed to him; and as the Persian Government had no naval force, it solicited British inter vention, The Resident in the Persian Gulf was accordingly instructed to negotiate for a renewal of the lease, and this was finallv effectedj for a period of eight years at a rent of 30,000 tomans. One'of the condi- ■ions of the lease was that, if a conqueror obtained possession of Muscat, Pers'an Government was not to he hound by any conditions of the covenant Accordingly, on the expulsion of Saiyid Salim in October 1808 by Azzan bin Qais (see Oman, Part III of this volume), the lease ec.ime nu an avoid, and the Persian Government appointed Haji Ahmad, formerly minister of Saiyid Salim, to the charge of Bandar Abbas and its dependencies. In February 1870 Haji Ahmad was ex- p lied from Bandar Abbas by Shaikh Said, acting on the part of Azzaa • p ' ' &gt;Uf ail ^ se( l uen tly regained bis position.

Tliey denied divine honours to Muhammad; abhorred and destroyed all holy tombs; abstained from the use of tobacco; and waged war against all Muham madans who did not accept their peculiar views. When in 1809 it became necessary to send a second expedition against the Qawasim {see Trucial Arab Shaikhs of Oman, infra) the ruler of Muscat was found to be in considerable danger from the aggressions of the Wahhabis. It was decided, however, not to attempt any operations by land, and to show extreme forbearance to the Wahhabi Amir. In 1811 the Wahhabis appeared in the vicinity of Muscat and plundered the territory of* Saiyid Said. Application was made by him for the assist ance of the British Government, but the request was refused on the ground that the British Government had recently co-operated with him merely for the extirpation of the pirates who interrupted the commerce of the Persian Gulf, not in prosecution of war against the Wahhabis, A heavy money payment induced them to retire for the time, but the in vasion was renewed by the Wahhabis under their general Mutlak-ul- Mutairi in 1813. Saiyid Said was relieved from this danger by the Wahhabi general's death, followed in 1814 by that of the Amir Sand, and by the invasion of Nejd from the westward by the Egyptians in 1816. An envoy had been sent by the Amir before his death to endeavour to negotiate a treaty of friendship and commerce with the British Government; but it was deemed inexpedient to negotiate any treaty or to form any intimate connection with the Amir, though a friendly intercourse was to be maintained with him. Meanwhile the Egyptian troops had taken the holy places of the Mnhammadan faith, and the Wahhabi power in that quarter was broken for the time. In 1818 Daraiyah, the Wahhabi capital, was taken by Ibrahim Pasha and razed to the ground. The Wahhabi Amir Abdulla (Sand's successor) was sent prisoner to Constantinople and there beheaded, and the overthrow of the Wahhabis appeared to be complete. In 1824, however, an insurrection against the Egyptians was headed by^ Turki, the son of Abdulla; the Egyptian Governor was compelled to retire, and Turki was proclaimed Amir of Nejd. Overtures were made by him to the Arab Shaikhs of the Persian Gulf to renew their former relations with the Wahhabis, and in 1825 the Shaikh of the Qawasim solicited the ad vice of the British Government as to the course he should pursue; he was warned against any proceedings bearing a predatory character or evincing unfriendliness towards the ruler of Muscat. During the next five or six years Turki was emploved in recovering the provinces formerly subject to the Wahhabis, and at the same time he endeavoured to conciliate the Pasha of Egypt by the payment of a small tribute. In 1831 Saiyid Said entered into an engagement acknowledging his supremacy and agreeing to pay an annual tribute, and the whole of the coast from Has al Hadd to184 PERSIAN GULF— Nejd. Kuwait, with (lie exception of Abu DJiabi, became subject to his authoritv About tins time tlie AValiliabi Amir expressed a desire to enter into inf mate relations with the British Government; to this a reply in ryenfJl but friendly terms was returned. In 18J1 a strong force of Wahhabis advanced into Oman. Strict neutrality was enjoined on the British authorities in the Persian Hnlf * he were diverted from schemes of foreign invasion by tie mill del of furki by bis nephew Mnshari. lie was in turn put to death by urJu s son Faisal, who then succeeded to power. Two years later large Egyptian force was assembled at Medina, and Faisal was sum- moned to contribute a contingent of troops.

In 1852, during the absence of Saiyid Said at Zanzibar, and while his son Saiyid Thuwaini was in charge of the government, Abdulla bin Faisal invaded Oman with a large force of AVahliabis, and demanded the cession of Sohar and the payment of a heavy tribute. Owing to the intervention of the British Resident, Saiyid Thuwaini was enabled to enter into negotiations which resulted in an agreement by the Muscat State to pay the Wahhabi Amir an annual tribute of 12,000 crowns, besides arrears to the extent of 60,000 crowns and the usual supply of provisions and stores. The Wahhabi Amir on his part agreed to assist the ruler of Muscat in every difficulty. The boundaries of the two States lemained as before. In 1859 Faisal again interfered in Bahrain affairs, and made exten sive preparations at Qatif and Dammam for the invasion of the island in favour of Muhammad bin Abdulla, the refugee Shaikh of Bahrain. The attitude assumed by the British naval force in the Persian Gulf induced him to abandon his design. He was then required to expel Muhammad bin Abdulla from Dammam, where for sixteen years his intrigues for the recovery of Bahrain had been the cause of constant disquietude. Dam mam was bombarded in November 1861, and Muhammad bin Abdulla was compelled to evacuate the fort. In August 1865 the Jannabah tribe resident at Sur, a town eighty miles south of Muscat, discontented with Saiyid Thuwaini, invited Ab- ,!„! a *;* n brother of the Wahhabi lieutenant, to join them m an attack the matter was allowed to drop.I &lt; 186 PERSIAN GULF— Nejd.

In 1886 the sons of Saud bin Faisal seized and imprisoned their uncle Abdulla bin Faisal, and Muhammad bin Saud assumed the title of Amir; whereupon Muhammad bin Rash id marched upon Riyadh, which he captured, and reinstated Abdulla as nominal Amir of the Wahhabis with the title of Imam. Abdulla was, however, taken to Hail and Bin Rashid placed an agent of his own at Riyadh. Three sons of Saud bin Faisal continued to reside at Kharj near Riyadh until 1888, when they were put to death by order of Muhammad bin Rashid, whose authority thus became paramount throughout Xejd. In 1889 the Amir Abdulla was permitted to return to Riyadh, where he died some years later. For the next thirteen years the power of the Rashid rulers of Hail remained paramount in Central Arabia. Abdur Rahman bin 1 aisal made an incursion in 1891, during which he captured Riyadh but he was soon dispossessed of it by Muhammad bin Rashid. Abdur Rahman then fled and at first joined the Bedouins of Hasa among whom he sojourned in constant fear of capture by the adherents of Muhammad bin Rashid. Later he lived at Qatar under the protection of the Shaikh of Dohah being joined there bv his family from Bahrain, and finally m 1892, at the invitation of the Turkish Wali of Basrah he settled down m Hasa on a pension granted him by the Poite. In 1897 Muhammad bin Rashid died and was succeeded by his nephew Abdul Aziz, who was soon embroiled with Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait. The latter, who had advanced into the centre of Arabia, met with de feat- but in 1901 Abdul Aziz, son of Abdur Rahman bin Faisal ant commonly known by the family patronymic of Bin ^aud, who was a refugee in Kuwait, suddenly made a surprise attack on Riyadh, whic e captured: and from that moment the fortunes of the Bin Saud fami y revived. Abdur Rahman bin Faisal stood aside m favour of his .on Abdul Aziz (Bin Saud), who resisted all the attempts of Bm Ras to turn him out of Riyadh, and in 1903 made his first overtures to the Resident at Bushire. The next year he captured Buraidah ^ defeated Bin Rashid, though the latter had the assistance of 2,500 Tur^s The Turks now awakened to the fact that they had been backing the wrono- horse in supporting Bin Rashid: and a meeting was arranged at Safwan between the Wali of Basrah, Bin Saud and Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait. At this meeting Bin Saud accepted a position of general sub- Ordi ^n at 1906 t \bdui e Aziz bin Rashid was defeated and slain in a battle with Bin Sand's Wahhabis, and the rapid murder of las two successors hastened the decline of the Bin Eashid family. In the same year Bin Saud, through the intermediary of the Shaikh of Kuwait and Shaikh Jassim of Qatar, renewed his overtures for someJ 88 PERSIAN GULF— Nejd. form of British recognition. TTe expected soon to occupy the Arabian Coast, and was hopeful of the extension to his territories of the Mari time Truce and consequent British protection against the Turks by sea His Majesty's Government decided that there was not sufficient justifica tion for departure from their policy of absolute aloofuess from the affairs of Nejd, and the Shaikhs of Qatar and Kuwait were informed that the overtures could not be entertained. In 1910 the Sharif of Mecca made an incursion into Central Arabia in which he gained some temporary success. The next year Bin Saud visited Kuwait and had friendly interviews with the British Political Agent. In 1913 Bin Saud turned the Turks out of Hasa, which he occupied himself. At the end of the year he had a friendly meeting with the Political Agents of Bahrain and Kuwait. In the following year he met Turkish Commissioners near Kuwait and arrived at a settlement of his affairs with them, though the outbreak of the Great War rendered this abortive. From the outbreak of the Great War Bin Saud declined all requests for assistance emanating from Constantinople and threw in his lot with the British Government, even agreeing to accept a British political officer. This officer. Captain Shakespear, was unfortunately killed with in a month of his arrival in the battle of Terrab between Bin Saud and Bin llashid. In December 1915 Bin Saud met Sir Percy Cox at Darin in Tarut, whcic a Tieaty (Tso. 11) was arranged by which the British Government acknowledged his independence and agreed to render aid in certain con- tinj&gt;encies. Hin Saud agreed not to alienate any portion of his terri tories to a foreign power. This agreement was 'subsequently annulled by the Treaty of Teddah (No. VII) in 1927. In 1916 the Sharif of Mecca rebelled against the Turks and for the next few years the British Government's policy was to keep the peace between the lival rulers of Arabia. They attempted to arrange a settle ment between Bin Saud and Bin Bashid, who had heen carrying on a desultory warfare of raid and counter raid, Bin Saud leaning to the Bn'tish side and Hin Rashid supporting the Turks. In furtherance of the general policy a meeting was arranged at Kuwait in November 1916 which was attended by Bin Saud, the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Moham- merali, and various Bedouin leaders. Certain outstanding differences were settled. 1917 and 1918 Political Officers from Mesopotamia visited Central Arabia to discuss outstanding questions with Bin Saud. 1 he political relations of His Majesty's Government with Nejd, which were conducted prior to 1921 through the Government of India have since been conducted direct.PERSIAN GULF—iVe/d. 189 The main preoccupation of the ruler of Nejd was his relations with the King of the Hejaz; but he also had minor difficulties with Bahrain in connection with the levy of customs dues on through traffic with his dominions, with Kuwait over boundaries and with the Amir of Ibha in Ashir. lie conducted a war against Jabal Shammar, which ended when Hail capitulated in November 1921 and the last scion of the family of Bin Rashid was led away captive. After removing this enemy on his flank Bin Sand considered him self strong enough to concentrate on his main enemy the King of the Hejaz. He had already occupied Khurma and Tabura in 1919. In 1924 his troops captured Taif and Mecca, and by 1925 he was in full possession of the Hejaz. The difficulties with Bahrain were composed by the Shaikh's accept ance of a proposal that the rate of customs duty on goods for re-export should be reduced from five to two per cent. arJ valorem, on the other hand agreement with the Shaikh of Kuwait on the long outstanding question of customs and transit dues has not yet been reached. Difficulties which had arisen between JSTejd on the one side and Iraq on the other were composed by an Agreement (No. Ill) between Nejd, Iraq and British representatives, signed at Mohammerah in May 1922. The boundary between the two countries was subsequently laid down by protocols to this Agreement, signed at Uqair in December 1922. The Kuwait boundary difficulty was composed in December 1922 by an Agreement (No. IV) made at XTqair between the Political Agent at Kuwait and a representative of Bin Saud. In May 1923 the Sultan of Nejd granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited, of London, an oil concession covering the province of Hasa. In May 1924 the Sultan of Nejd and the Shaikh of Kuwait jointly granted an oil concession to the same Syndicate in respect of the neutral zone between the two principalities. As the Syndicate has not complied with its obligations to commence and carry on operations, both concessions are subject to forfeiture and cancellation, if not actually null and void. In November 1925 two agreements were signed, known as the Balira Agreement (No. V) for the regulation of tribal matters and for setting up a tribunal to deal with tribal raids between Iraq and Nejd, and the Iladda Agreement (No, VI) which defined relations between Nejd and Trans-Jordan. In May 1927 a Treaty (No. VII) was concluded at Jeddah between His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and Nejd, which cancelled the treaty of December 1915 and defined afresh the relations between the contracting parties.190 PERSIAN GULF-Bahrain. In 1L8 the erection of police posts by the Iraq Government at liusaiyaii, a watering place some GO miles on the Iraq side of the h- Nejd frontier, was greatly resented by Bin Sand and some of his trib?' vzz -&gt; tlie Ajman and Mutair, Shammar, Barb and Ataibah. The laf/' regarded the establishment of these posts as a serious restriction on their right of access to water, and consequently on their accustomed mode of lite, and set about raiding on an extensive scale into Iraq. This mad Bin Sand decide to summon the tribal Shaikhs to a conference at which he issued orders for the suspension of raids for a period of two months pending further discussion with the British Representative, Sir Gilbert Clayton on the question of the posts and certain other matters of common interest between Iraq and ^ejd. The tribes, however, soon became restive at the delay and early in 1929 rebelled against Bin Saud and recommenced raiding. Extensive operations, which had therefore to be undertaken against them, ended in their surrender and subsequent punish- ment and in February 1930 a meeting between the King of Iraq and , ln ,/ ' . 0n i H.M.S. Lupin in the Persian Gulf, was facilitated by the British Government. At this meeting an amicable agreement on he question of the posts at Busaiyah and certain other outstanding ques tions was reached. 0 ^ 2. Bahrain.

In 1821 the Shaikhs of Bahrain agreed to pay a fixed annual tribute of 30,000 crowns to the ruler of Muscat; but the guarantee of the British Government, for which both parties were anxious, was not given. Sub sequently the tribute was reduced to 18,000 crowns, but ceased with the failure of an attack made on the island by Saiyid Said in 1828. In 1830 tribute was demanded by the Wahhabis, and their protection was purchased by an annual payment of 4,000 crowns. Three years later Shaikh Abdulla of Bahrain refused allegiance to the Wahhabis, induced the neighbouring tribes to make incursions into their territory, and block aded their ports. The dispute terminated by his promising to pay them a tribute of 2,000 dollars, on the understanding that they would assist him against anv invaders of Bahrain, and would not demand his co-operation against Muscat. On the death in 1834 of his nephew and colleague Shaikh Khalifa bin Sulaiman, Shaikh Abdulla became sole ruler of Bah rain. In 1839 the commander of the Egyptian forces in the neighbour hood of Bahrain announced his intention of attacking the island, as forming part of Nejd, over which claims were asserted by Egypt. He was informed that the British Government could not admit any claim of Egypt to Bahrain. In 1843 the British Government declined to recog nise similar claims advanced by Persia to sovereignty over Bahrain. Shortly after the conclusion of the Engagement of 1847 (No. XXIII), overtures were made to the Shaikh of Bahrain by the Turkish authorities at Basrah with the object of obtaining his recognition of the supremacy of the Porte. The ministers of the Sultan were informed that, as the British Government had had treaty relations with Bahrain as an inde pendent power, they could not acknowledge or acquiesce in any arrange ment for placing the island under the sovereignty or protection of the Porte. The Shaikhs of Bahrain were not parties to any of the agreements con cluded after 1820 with the Arab Shaikhs, except the Engagement {see Trucial Arab Shaikhs of Oman, No. XXIII) for the suppression of the slave trade, signed in 184T by Muhammad bin Khalifa, and an additional Agreement' (No. IX) concluded with him in 1856, by which he bound himself to seize and deliver to British vessels of war slaves brought to his territories from any quarter whatever, and to put an embargo on any vessel belonging to him or his subjects, which might be ascertained to have carried slaves. Muhammad bin Khalifa was the grandson of Sulaiman bin Ahmad who hud signed the General Treaty (No. XIX) in 1820. Sulaiman bin XI192 PERSIAN GULF— Bahrain. Ahmad died in 1825, and his son Khalifa, who had snrreeded to his share in tlie government, died it' 1884. Mnliammad bin Khalifa was for some years kept out of power hy liis grand-nncle Abdulla bin Ahmad; but ii, 184-3 he succeeded not only in recovering his rights but in expelling Abdulla bin Ahmad from Bahrain. The latter, who found refuge in Dammam, made several unsuccessful attempts, with the help of the Wah- habis and the Shaikh of Kuwait, to recover his power. He died in 1848, but his son Muhammad bin Abdulla continued the feud. His warlike preparations and his piracies so endangered the peace of the Gulf that in 1859 he was declared a public enemy and expelled from Dammam by a British force. Xo sooner was ibis done than Muhammad bin Khalifa of Bahrain began to levy imposts on Wahhabi vessels, and to carry off their property. On being remonstrated with he made simultaneous applica tions for protection to the Persian Governor of Fars and the Turkish Wali of Baghdad. The Persian flag was hoisted on the arrival of an Agent of the former, only to be immediately pulled down and replaced by the Turkish flag on the arrival of an Agent of the latter. Both Agents dis appeared from Bahrain after a short interval, during which representa tions had been made, and assurances secured, by His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. Earlv in 1861, therefore, when the Shaikh of Bahrain, in violation of his treaty eng agements, again blockaded the Wahhabi ports, he was forced by the Resident in the Persian Gulf to withdraw the blockade, and was required to conclude a perpetual Treaty (No. X) of peace and friendship, binding himself to abstain from war, piracy and the importation of slaves by sea, on condition of protection against similar aggressions, and to permit all British subjects to trade with Bahrain on payment of an ad ralorcm duty of 5 per cent, on their goods. In 1863, in consequence of complaints made against the lawless people on the south-east coast of the peninsula, Shaikh Muhammad bin Khalifa sent his cousin Muhammad bin Ahmad to Qatar to act as his Amir or deputy. This official arrested and deported to Bahrain the local Shaikh of Wakrah, and made himself so unpopular during the next two or three years that he was at last compelled to return to Bahrain. Shaikh Muham mad bin Khalifa thereupon, in October 186T, sent a force from Bahrain under the command of his brother Ali to punish the people of Qatar; and at the same time invited the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to co-operate with his troops, a.s Bida (now known as Dohah) and Wakrah had long been harbours of refuge for seceders from Oman. Shaikh Zaid bin Khalifa promptly accepted the invitation ami joined Shaikh Ali with 2,000 men: and the combined forces, after-destroying a large number of Qatar boats, attacked and sacked the towns of Wakrah and Bida with circumstances of peculiar barbarity, and plundered property of the estimated value of eleven lakhs of krans. As Loth the Bahrain and Abu Dhabi Shaikhs were bound by their engagements with the British Governjnent to abstain from aggression ofPERSIAN 0ULF— Ttahmin. 193 Tji- !tjv ; every kind by sea; to appeal to the British Resident as arbitrator; and to afford full redress for all maritime offences winch could justly be charg ed against them or their subjects, steps were taken to exact reparation for these outrages. Before this could be effected the tribes of Qatar retaliated by an attack on Bahrain which proved unsuccessful; but in the naval action which took place a number of vessels were destroyed and great loss of life occurred. The Resident in the Persian Gulf, accompanied by H.M.S. Vigilant and the gun-boats Chide and 11 ugh Hose, proceeded to Bahrain. Muham mad bin Khalifa fled to the Qatar coast, and an Agreement (No. XI) was signed by his brother Ali bin Khalifa and the principal persons in Bah rain, by which they declared Muhammad bin Khalifa to have forfeited by his piratical outrages all claim to the chiefship of Bahrain, and Ali bin Khalifa bound himself to pay a fine of one hundred thousand dollars. Under these conditions he was permitted to continue in power; but the Abu Mahur fort near Muharraq was destroyed, and the war craft belong ing to Muhammad bin Khalifa were burnt. After about one-fifth of the fine had been realised and distributed rateably among the sufferers, the remainder was remitted. Through the mediation of the Resident an agreement* was also con cluded between the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Shaikhs of the Qatar tribes, determining the amount of tribute annually payable by the latter and the manner of its payments. The tribute, which was only paid for two years, was discontinued when the Turks established themselves in Bida. The deposed Shaikh was forbidden to reside at Bahrain; but in Janu ary 1869, at the request of Ali bin Khalifa, who believed he could keep a * We, the undersigned Chiefs, all residing in the province of Qatar, do hereby solemnly agree and bind ourselves to pay to Shaikh Ali bin Khalifa, (Chief of Bahrein, the sums of money per annum heretofore paid by us to the Chiefs of Bahrein, as follows: this total sum to be paid by us to Muhammad bin Thani of Doha and by him to the Resident for delivery to the Agent of the Chief of Bahrein, at Bushire ; — 1,700 Krans on account of the Mahanda tribe, 1,500 Krans on account of the Al Bu Aainen and Nayim tribes, 500 Krans on account of the Semsemieh tribe (i.e., the Al Bu Kuwara, who live at Sximesma), 500 Krans on account of the Keleb tribe, 1,500 Krans on account of the Sudan tribe, 2,500 Krans on account of Muhammad bin Thani (Chief of the Maadhid) and the Musallam tribe, 800 Krans on account of the Amamera tribe. 9,000 Krans.

He soon, however, began to in trigue, and it became necessary to deport him to Kuwait, whence he afterwards proceeded to Qatif. In September 1869 Muhammad bin Khalifa, aided bv his relative Nasir bin Mubarak and a considerable force of the Bani Hajir tribe, sailed for Bahrain and attacked the fort of Eifa-ash-Sharqi, then held by Muhammad bin Abdulla, son of the Shaikh who died in 1848. An engagement ensued in which, owing- mainly to the treachery of Muhammad bin Abdulla, the Bahrain force was defeated, Ali bin Khalifa, one of his sons and several of his Shaikhs, were killed, and the invaders took possession of Manamah and Muharraq, the two chief towns of Bahrain. Manamah was given up to plunder, and property belonging to British subjects and others, of the estimated value of upwards of twelve lakhs of rupees, was carried oft. Muhammad bin Abdulla then imprisoned Muhammad bin Khalifa and assumed the government of the island. In order to exact reparation for this unpro voked outrage the British Resident proceeded thither, accompanied by H.M.S. Daphne and Nymphe and the gun-boats Hugh Hose and Clyde of the Bombay Marine. The fort of Manamah on the sea-shore was bom barded and destroyed: and, with the exception of Nasir bin Mubarak, who escaped to the mainland, all the leading marauders, including Muhammad bin Khalifa and Muhammad bin Abdulla, were captured, and Isa bin Ali bin Khalifa, a son of the late Shaikh, was installed as Shaikh, on the understanding that the property of the pirate leaders would be considered as forfeited and applied in the first instance towards the reimbursement of the persons plundered. The prisoners, five in number, were taken to Bombay and confined as State prisoners in the fort of Asirgarh, whence they were afterwards removed to Chunar. Two of them, Nasir bin Ahmad (the Wazir of Shaikh Ali bin Khalifa, who de serted to the side of Xasir bin Mubarak) and Muhammad bin Abdulla died there, the former in 1873 and the latter in 1877. The remaining three prisoners were in 1878 removed to Aden where in 1880 two of them, Jasim bin Muhammad Hasan, AVazir of Muhammad bin Abdulla, and Ali bin Nasir A1 Abdulla, were released. The last of the five, Muham mad bin Khalifa, was finally released in 1887 on the sole condition of residence in the holy cities of Arabia. He died at Mecca in 1890. His numerous sons were provided with certain personal allowances by the Shaikh of Bahrain. In October 1888 Shaikh Ahmad bin Ali, the most influential of Shaikh Isa's brothers, died. He had, in accordance with an old custom, enjoyed a moiety of the revenues of the island and exer cised a considerable amount of power and authority. The Shaikh of Bahrain then appointed his own eldest son Selman as successor to his late brother. On Selman s death in 1893 the Shaikh's second son Hamad was nominated as his heir. The weakness of Isa bin Ali's rule more than once led to intrigues for the restoration of the exiled (A1 Abdulla) branch of the family:PERSIAN GULF— Bahrain. 195 and in 1874, in 1880, in 1892, and again in 1894 an attack on Bahrain was threatened by their partisans, the Bani Hajir tribe, but was prevented by the presence of British vessels and by the warnings addressed by the British authorities to the various Shaikhs upon the coast. Th,e Turkish authorities of Hasa, originally at the instigation oi Jasina bin Thaiii, on more than one occasion expressed the intention oi rebuilding the town of Zubarah on the west coast of Qatar opposite Bahrain and estab lishing a military post there; but the Shaikh of Bahrain invariably pro tested on the ground of his ancient rights there and oi the menace to Bahrain which such proceedings would involve. (Prior to the concjuesl of Bahrain by the A1 Khalifa family, Zubarah was their head-quarters; but it was left unoccupied by Shaikh Isa.) The Porte as well as Nasir bin Mubarak and Jasim bin Thani were frequently informed by the British Government that no hostile settlement would be permitted at Zubarah. In March 1895 an act of violence committed by Shaikh Khalid bin Ali, for which his brother Shaikh Isa failed to give redress, brought matters to a climax. The A1 Bin Ali tribe of Bahrain removed in a body to Qatar, where their leader. Sultan bin Salama, promptly entered into relations with Shaikh Jasim bin Thani. Ihe latter, after osten sibly endeavouring to effect a reconciliation between the Bahrain Shaikh and the seceding tribe, resolved to settle the A1 Bm All at Zubarah. This proposal was supported by the authorities of Hasa, who at once despatched a Mudir and a gun-boat to the scene and caused the Ottoman flao- to be hoisted there. In spite of the presence of two British men-of- war, H.M.S. Sphinx and H.M.S. Pigeon, an invasion of Bahrain was seriously threatened, and a large number of boats was collected by Shaikh Jasim for the purpose. Eventually tlie British vessels opened fire on the Arab fleet, disabling 40 boats. Shaikh Jasim then offered full submis sion; the Mudir retired to Hasa; and 120 more boats were surrendered and removed to Bahrain, two-thirds of them being subsequently burnt and one -third restored to their owners on payment of an indemnity. The maioritv of the A1 Bin Ali returned to Bahrain, though their Shaikh ac companied Shaikh Jasim to Bida (now known as Dohah). Zubarah was completely evacuated. After the accession of Shaikh Isa, the Turkish authorities on several occasions evinced a disposition to interfere in the affairs of Bahrain ; but the British Government invariably asserted the Shaikh's independence from Turkish control. In 1880 Shaikh Isa signed an Agreement (No. XII) undertaking to abstain from entering into negotiations or making treaties with any foreign power without the consent of the British Government. In 1892 Shaikh Isa signed an Agreement (No. XIII) promising to enter into no agreement or correspondence with any other power than the British; to disallow the residence within his territory of the agent of any196 PERSIAN GULF— Bahrain. other power; and neither to cede, sell, mortgage nor otherwise give for occupation any part of his territory save to the British Government. In 1893 the Porte objected to British officials taking up the cases of Bahrain subjects suffering from the piracies of the Bani Hajir. They were informed in reply that Bahrain was under British protection. Later in the same year a claim was put forward by the Porte to treat the people of Bahrain as Turkish subjects within Ottoman territories. The British Government, however, maintained its right to extend British protection to the subjects of the Shaikh whenever occasion might demand. In 1898 Shaikh Isa signed an Agreement (No. XIV) absolutely pro hibiting ihe importation and exportation of arms into and from his ter ritory. In 1900 a Political Agency, subordinate to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, was established at Bahrain. In December 1900 a cousin of the Shaikh of Bahrain named Salman bin Diaij, his son, nephew and 28 followers, were attacked on the Dhah- ran coast of the mainland and murdered by Bedouins of the Behaih section of the A1 Moirah tribe. Ihe incident caused great concern to Shaikh Isa. J lis demands for the surrender or punishment of the offenders, and lor compensation for the families of his cousin's retainers, were not complied with by the Turkish authorities. In 1905 Shaikh Ali bin Ahmad, a nephew of the Shaikh, was de- ported to Bombay for five years, owing to his being concerned in two serious cases of assault on German and Persian subjects. In 1909 His Majesty's Government approved of a proposal by the Government of India to raise the local personal salute of Shaikh Isa from 5 to 11 guns, and granted a salute of 3 guns to his eldest son when lepiesenting his father; the salutes to be fired on the termination of the official visits of the Shaikh or his son, as his representative, to anv of His Majesty's ships. In the same year Shaikh Isa wrote to the Political Agent that he desired the British Government to exercise jurisdiction over foreigners. The Turks annexed Zakhnuniyah island, which had hitherto been regarded as a possession of the Shaikhs of Bahrain, but subsequently evacuated it after a British protest. . In 1911 Shaikh Isa undertook not to allow the establishment at Bali- ram of the post offices of any Government other than the British: and m the same year gave an undertaking, similar to that given bv the Shaikh of Kuwait (see Kuwait, No. XXXIX), not to respond, without consulting the Resident in the Persian Gulf, to overtures for pearling concessions and sponge fishing in respect of the banks over which he possessed rights. In 1012 Shaikh Isa granted (No. XV) the British Government a piece of land for th,9 erection of a wireless telegrapli installation.'C PEKSIAN GULF— Trucial Arab Shaikhs of Oman. 197 % it, i,. In May 1913 Bin Sand, Amir of Nejd, drove tlie Turks out of Hasa; and great improvenient in tlie safety of the trade routes in tliat pro\ince quickly followed. In 1914 the Shaikh gave a written undertaking (No. XVI) that he would neither himself embark on the exploitation of oil nor entertain overtures for concessions from any quarter without the approval of the British Government. In October 1914 ships bearing troops which subsequently assisted m the capture of Basrah arrived at Bahrain. The attitude of Shaikh Isa and his son Shaikh Abdulla was helpful. The next year the Turks, who had retained a garrison at A1 Bidam Qatar after the evacuation of llasa, abandoned this post: and vath it ( is- appeared the last vestiges of Turkish influence in the Bahrain area. In 1917 began a period of misgovernment particularly affecting the Shia inhabitants of Bahrain, culminating in 1923 m attacks by t e Dawasir and other Sunni tribes on Shia villages, and a not m Manamah town between Persians and Nejdis. As a result Shaikh Isa agieec m that year to resign all power into the hands of his son Shaikh Hamad, while retaining his titular position. The Dawasir tribe, who had hither to enjoyed a privileged position, alleging that they were unable to submi to the new regime, migrated to the mainland from which a considerable number of them have since letumed. The Bahrain Order in Council was brought into force m lebruary I 919 . . . t • . In 1920 Bin Sand expressed a wish to improve his poits of Lqan, Jubail and Qatif; but nothing has yet been accomplished in this matter. In the same year customs duty levied at Bahrain on cargo bound for the ports of Hasa was reduced from five to two per cent. Since the accession of Shaikh Hamad to power as Deputy Shaikh, many improvements have been effected 111 the administration, ami the worst of the abuses existing under the rule of Shaikh Isa have been abolished.

Treaty relations also exist with the Shaikh of Qatar (see infra). I he Trucial Shaikhs are all independent rulers. At one period in the past they were directly or indirectly liable for a tribute to the Wahhabi Amirs of Nejd but with the advent of the Turks and the subsequent isolation of the Wahhabis in the highlands they emancipated themselves from any such payment. The Qawasim, who have occupied the province of Sir from the earliest times, carried on a vigorous and profitable trade by sea, till in 1805 they succumbed to the influence of the Wahhabis and were drawn into the piratical projects of that turbulent sect. Under their influence the Qawasim plundered two British vessels and treated the commanders with great cruelty. An expedition was sent to the Persian Gulf to punish them for this aggression and to co-operate with the Imam of Muscat, who was then at war with them. The expedition resulted in the conclusion of a Treaty (No. XVII), in February 1806, binding the Qawasim to respect the flag and property of the British, and to assist vessels touch ing on their coast. This treaty appears to have been concluded without reference to the Wahhabis. The spread of &lt;he Wahhabis in Oman soon threatened the ruler of Muscat with destruction: and the British Government determined to support him and, as the only means of preserving the peace of the Gulf, to destroy (he piratical fleets. A strong force was despatched in 1809, which took Ras-al-Khaimah, Lingeh, La ft and Shinas, and destroyed the boats of the pirates. No treaty could at this time be concluded with the Qawasim, whose government had been completely overthrown by the W ahhabis, nor were any permanent measures taken to secure the advan tages gained in 1809; consequently, piracy soon re-appeared. In 1814 the Qawasim professed a desire to be at peace with the British Govern ment, provided they were left at liberty to make war on the neighbour ing Arab tribes. They even expressed themselves ready to abstain from molesting their Arab neighbours, if the British Government would guarantee them protection from the vengeance of the Wahhabi Amir; but they were quite unable to make good their professions. Even after the negotiation of preliminary articles of peace with the Resident at Bushire, the Qawasim attacked and plundered British vessels: other tribes were soon drawn under the Wahhabi influence, and piracy increased to an intolerable extent. An expedition was therefore despatched to the Per sian Gulf m 1819 for the purpose of completelv crushing them. Ras-al- Khannah was taken, and Engagements (No. XVIII) were made with the VrV m'. P re]Lmin a r y to the conclusion of a General Treaty (No. . X). The object of the preliminary engagements w^as to include all matters of a temporary or individual character, so as to reserve the general treaty exclusively for arrangements of a permanent nature common to all the Arab Shaikhs who might be disposed to sign it.PERSIAN GULF— Trucial Arab Shaikhs of Oman. 199 By the 9tli article of the Treaty of 1820 carrying oif slaves from the coasts of Africa or elsewhere, and transporting them in vessels, were declared to be plunder and piracy; but this was not interpreted as for- biddmg traffic in slaves, but as prohibiting kidnapping only. A very extensive trade in slaves was carried on from the ports of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf with Kathiawar, (hitch and the Indian States on the west coast of India; but under the interpretation put on the Treaty of 1820, the British Government had no power to interfere with ihia trade. In April 1838, under instructions from Government, the Resident in the Persian Gulf obtained from the Trucial Shaikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah, Ajman, Dibai and Abu Dhabi an Agreement (No. XX), giving to British cruisers the right to detain and search vessels suspected of being em ployed in carrying off slaves, and to confiscate the vessels if found so em ployed. In the following yeai the Shaikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah, Dibai, Abu Dhabi and Umm-al-Qaiwain (Amulgavine) entered into an Agree ment (Xo. XXI) containing three articles. The first and second of these articles gave the British Government the right to search and confiscate slave vessels found beyond a line from Cape Delgado, on the African coast, passing two degrees east of Sokotra, and ending at Cape Gwadar, on the Makran coast, unless driven beyond that line by stress of weather or other necessity. By the third article the sale of persons of the Somali tribe was declared to be piracy. The same Shaikhs, and also the Shaikhs of Ajman and Bahrain, entered into Engagements* (No. XXIII) in 1847, binding themselves to prohibit the exportation of slaves from the African coast, or elsewhere, in vessels belonging to themselves or their subjects, and authorising British cruisers to confiscate vessels found engaged in the forbidden traffic. In 1850 the Trucial Shaikhs signed an Agreement similar to that concluded with the Shaikh of Bahrain (No IX). The treaty concluded with the Trucial Arab Shaikhs in 1820 did not limit the right of the Shaikhs to carry on acknowledged war with each other by sea, that is to say, war proclaimed and avowed by one Shaikh upon another. All other hostile aggressions, however, were declared to be piratical. But under the name of acknowledged war many acts of piracy were committed, especially during the pearl-fishing season. The Shaikhs were therefore induced in 1835 to bind themselves, by a maritime truce, not in any circumstances to engage in hostilities by sea for a period of six months, on the understanding that the British Government would not interfere with their wars by land. The effects of this truce were ^o marked that the Shaikhs were easily persuaded in the following year, and again in 1837, to renew it for eight months. Thereafter it was renewed annually till 1843, when it was prolonged (No. XXII) for ten vears On the expiry of the ten years' truce in 1853 a Treaty (No. XXIV) of * An Act of Parliament, 12 and 13 Vic., Cap. LXXXIV, was passed to give effect to these engagements. (See Appendix No. I.)200 PERSIAN GULF— Trucial Arab Shaikhs of Oman, perpetual peace was concluded, wliich. provided that there should be a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the sub scribing parties; that in (he event of aggressions on any one bv sea, the injured tribe should not retaliate, but refer the matter to the British authorities in the Persian Gulf; and that the British Government should watch over the peace of the Gulf and ensure at all times the due observ ance of the treaty. In 1864 the Trucial Shaikhs bound themselves (No. XXVj to prevent their subjects from interfering with the telegraphic operations in or near their territories. In 1867 the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi joined the Shaikh of Bahrain in a piratical outrage on the tribes inhabiting the A1 Qatar coast. On the appearance of British vessels of war off Abu Dhabi the Shaikh signed an Agieement ( j N o . XX\ I) not to commit any breach of the maritime peace and to pay a fine of 25,000 dollars. After'about one-fifth of this fine had been realized the remainder was remitted in consequence of the subse quent good behaviour of the Shaikh. At the same time an Agreement (Xo. XXVII) was signed by Muham mad bin Thani, the principal Shaikh of A1 Qatar, by which he bound himself not to put to sea with hostile intentions, to have no connection with Muhammad bin Khalifa, and to refer any difference of opinion with the Shaikh of Bahrain to the arbitration of the British Resident. In 187;J the Trucial Shaikhs renewed (Xos. XXVIII and XXIX) their engagements to prohibit the traffic in slaves. In IS(8 the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was allowed to assert his rights of possession at A1 Odaid, adjoining A1 Qatar, In 1879 the Irucial Shaikhs entered into a mutual agreement regard ing the surrender of fraudulent absconders or payment of their liabilities. r Ihis agreement is. however, not an engagement to the Paramount Power, nor guaranteed in any way. In 1892 the Trucial Shaikhs signed Agreements (No. XXX) promising not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any power other t ian the British; not to admit the agent of any other government; and not to part with any portion of their territories save to the British Government. In 19°° on. the death of the Shaikh of Eas-al-Ehaimah, Humaid bin Abdulla, the place was annexed by the Shaikh of Shareah to his dominions from which it had been separated in 1869. 190 ^ A g re ® m&lt;!uts ( No - XXXI) were obtained from the Shaikhs of Uibm Shargah, Umm-al-Qaiwain, Ajman and. Abu Dhabi, in which they bound themselves to prohibit the importation and exportation of arms into and from their respective territories.% PERSIAN GULF— Trucial Aral) Shaikhs of Oman. 201 In 1910 Shaikh Salim bin Sultan, an uncle of the ruling Shaikh of Shargah, assumed charge of Kas-al-Khaimah without the hitter's consent. Ihe same year a naval party from H.M.S. Hyacinth, which landed at Uibai to search for arms, was fired on, 5 men were killed and 9 wounded; the Arabs were reported to have lost 37 men. The Shaikh was immedi ately fined Rs. 50,000 and the townsfolk 400 rifles: and the Shaikh was forced to agree, in accordance with his treaty obligations, to the accept ance of a telegraph station at Dibai, and to replace immediately a tide pole which had been removed. No telegraph station, however, was opened. In 1911 the T rucial Shaikhs gave undertakings, similar to that given by the Shaikh of Kuwait ( j N o . XXXIX), not to- respond, without consult ing the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to overtures for pearling concessions and sponge fishing in respect of the banks over which they possessed rights. In 1912 the Shaikh of Shargah agreed (No. XXXII) to the construc tion by the British Government of a lighthouse on Tamb Island, In 1914, owing to his contumacious attitude and disregard of Govern ment's advice in regard to the treatment of his brother, the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain was fined Rs. 15,000 and compelled to pay Rs, 10,000 in settlement of his brother's claims. In 1910 the Shaikh of Qatar signed a Treaty (No. XXXIII) with the British Government undertaking obligations and accepting privileges similar to those of the Trucial Shaikhs. It was agreed at the time that the bringing into operation of articles VII, VIII and IX should be post poned, and these articles have not yet been brought into operation. In the same year the Shaikh of Qatar issued a Proclamation prohibit ing traffic in arms in his territory. On the death in 1919 of Shaikh Salim, his son Shaikh Sultan suc ceeded him as Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah : and in 1921 his independent status was recognised by Government. In 1922 the Trucial Shaikhs signed undertakings (Nos. XXXIV and XXXV) not to grant any concessions for oil within their territories ex cept with the permission of the British Government. In October 1925 a cousin of the Residency Agent, Shargah, was killed in an unsuccessful attempt on the Residency Agent's life. After in vestigation the Shaikh's father-in-law, Abdur Rahman, was deported to Aden for four years. The Shaikh of Shargah was fined Rs. 3,000 and compelled to pay 800 dollars as blood money. In 1925 the fort of Fujairah was bombarded and the Shaikh fined Rs. 1,500 because of his defiant attitude in a slavery case. Fujairah was a feudatory of the Shaikh of Shargah until 1901, when the Shaikh of Fujairah asserted his independence; which has, however, never been formally recognised.PERSIAN GULF— Kuwait. Soon after, hostilities broke out between Fujairah and Kalba, a de pendency of Shargah. Intermittent hostilities continued till the summer of 1927 when, at the instance of the Political Resident, a settlement was brought about by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. 4. K uwait. Kuwait was founded about the beginning of the eighteenth century by settlers of the Utub, over whom the Subah family enjoyed predomin ance, and grew rapidly in the first fifty years of its existence. The recorded history of British relations with Kuwait opens in 1775, when, on the investment of Basrah by the Persians, the British desert mail from the Persian Gulf to Aleppo was first despatched from Kuwait, an arrangement which continued until 1779. In 1805 the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Zubarah asked the British Govern ment to guarantee them a safe retreat in Bahrain, in the event of their severing their connection with the Wahhabis, who, they said, might otherwise force them to engage in depredations on British trade. Their proposals were not entertained. In 1809 an offer by the Shaikh of Kuwait to join the British expedi tion against lias-al-Khaimah with his fleet was refused. In December 1821, on account of difficulties with the Turkish authori ties, the British liesidency at Basrah was temporarily removed to an island in Kuwait territory. In 1841 Shaikh Subah bin Jabir, on behalf of his father, signed an undertaking to adhere to the Maritime Truce for a period of one year. In May 1896 Shaikh Mubarak became ruler of Kuwait. At first the attitude of the Turks towards him was one of neutrality, but in 1897 they appointed him Qaitn-rnaqam of Kuwait. In February 1897 the Turks sent a quarantine official to Kuwait, and in the same month the Shaikh asked for an interview with the Political Resident or an agent deputed by him. The Extra Assistant to the Resident eventually ar rived in Kuwait in September, and the Shaikh intimated that he and his people would like to come under British protection to avoid annexation by the Turks. He repeated his request a year later. Her Majesty's Government did not, however, accede to his request. In January 1899 the Shaikh signed an Agreement (No. XXXVI) binding him and his successors not to alienate any part of his territory without the consent of the British Government: and Her Majesty's Government undertook, so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement, to support them and accord them their good offices. In May 1899 Shaikh Mubarak established regular customs at Kuwait, and began to realise an enhanced duty of five per cent, on all imports, including those from Turkish ports. In September a Turkish harbour-PERSIAN GULF— Kuwait. 203 master with five soldiers arrived to take charge of the port but had to return to Basrah, as the Shaikh would not receive him. In May 1900 Shaikh Mubarak agreed (No. XXXVII) to prohibit the importation of arms into Kuwait, and their exportation therefrom, and issued notifications to that effect, and to the effect that vessels suspected of carrying arms were liable to be searched, and all arms found confis cated. In the summer of 1900 the series of events began which led eventu ally to the restoration of the Wahhabi dynasty in Nejd. Before that was brought about, however. Shaikh Mubarak led a remarkable incursion in their interests into the very heart of Central Arabia. A severe engage ment took place at Sarif, near Buraidah, which, though attended by heavy losses to both sides, obliged Mubarak to retreat to Kuwait. Ihe seriousness of the situation was soon brought home to him. Accordingly he approached the Political Resident through the Commandei of II.M.S. Sphinx with a request that the British Government would assume a per manent protectorate over Kuwait as soon as possible. His request was., however, rejected. In December 1901 the Turkish sloop of war Zuhaf arrived at Kuwait and delivered an ultimatum to the Shaikh, requiring him either to re ceive a Turkish military detachment at Kuwait or to leave Kuwait and retire to Constantinople. The Shaikh gave a politic but negative icply and the Zuhaf withdrew Towards the end of the same month there was reason to think that a land attack on Kuwait was contemplated by a combined force of Turk? and Bin Rashid's followers. Dispositions were immediately made by the British naval force to co-operate in the defence of the town. This deterred Bin Rashid, who withdrew to his own part of the desert. The most dangerous direct attack to which Mubarak had been exposed was arranged for the autumn of 1902 by Yusuf bin Abdullah of Dorah : its object was to seize Kuwait by a coup de main. A large body of Sharifat Arabs from the Persian side, under the Shaikh's nephews em barked at Dorah on the Shatt-al-Arab. The Commander of H.M.S. Lapwing received news of the expedition on the 3rd September at 1 T ao, and immediately hastened to Kuwait to give the alarm, but found the town already under arms. Search for the enemy was made, at first without success, but on the 5th they were discovered. Two boats con taining a hundred and fifty riflemen were pursued by the armed boats of the Lay win (j. After a sharp fight the boats and their contents, in cluding scaling ladders, were captured. The visit paid by the Viceroy (Lord Curzon) in November 1903 mark ed the consolidation of British influence in Kuwait, and placed in a clear light the Shaikh's cordial relations with the British Government. In 1904 the Shaikh agreed (No. XXXVIII) not to allow the establish ment of a post office by any other Government.204 PERSIAN GULF— Kuwait. The appointment of a British Political Agent to Kuwait was authorised in June 1904, and the first incumbent of the post arrived in August. In 1907 the Shaikh agreed to lease in perpetuity to the British Gov ernment a plot of land to the south of Bandar Shuwaikh for Rs. GO,000 per annum, leaving to them the right to relinquish the lease at anv time should they wish to do so. At the same time the British Government assured Shaikh Mubarak that they recognised that the town of Kuwait and its boundaries belonged to him and to his heirs after him : that all his arrangements, including customs arrangements, would remain in his hands and in those of his heirs after him : and that the British Govern ment would collect no customs duties in the Bandar Shuwaikh lands or in any other lands that they might thereafter lease from him or hia heirs after him. The Bandar Shuwaikh lease was relinquished in 1922. In 1911 Shaikh Mubarak gave an undertaking (No. XXXIX) not to respond, without consulting the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to overtures for pearling concessions and sponge fishing in respect of the banks over which he possessed rights. In 1912 Shaikh Mubarak agreed (No. XL) to the erection of a wire less telegraph installation. In 1918 Shaikh Mubarak gave a written undertaking (No. XLT) not to permit the exploitation of oil in his territories by any one except a person recommended by the British Government. The outbreak of the Great War excited little interest in Kuwait until the entry of Turkey into the War, which aroused some sympathy with her. This, however, did not last, aud in return for Shaikh Mubarak's unswerving loyalty and offer of co-operation during the 'War, the British Government guaranteed him against all consequences of his attack on Safwan, T mm Qasi and Bubiyan, and assured him that his date gardens between 1 ao and Qurnah would remain in the possession of himself and his heirs and be immune from taxation for ever and that Kuwait would be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. (No. XLII). It had been agreed in 1913 that an Indian Post Office should be estab lished at Kuwait on the ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention, and an Office was in fact opened under the orders of the Government of India at the beginning of 1915. In February 1915 the V iceroy, Lord Hardinge, visited Kuwait. Shaikh Mubaiak died in November 191-i and was succeeded by his eldest son Jabir, to whom the Viceroy sent a letter congratulating him on his succession, and assuring him that, so long as he acted up to exist- ing airangements with the British Government, he might expect the same support as Imd been enjoyed by his father.PERSIAN GULF— Kuwait. 205 Shaikh Jabir died in February 1917 and was succeeded by his brother Salim, to whom the assurances given to his predecessor were renewed. In February 1918 it was found necessary to enforce a blockade of Kuwait, which lasted until the conclusion of the armistice with Turkey, and in July the Shaikh was warned that the assurances given to him and to his father, and the friendship, protection and assistance of the British Government enjoyed by his father, would be continued only on the condi tion that he should be personally responsible for, and prevent, all acts in his territory whether committed by his own subjects or by other persons, which might be against the interests of the British Government. The latter part of Salmi's reign was marked by increasingly strained relations between him and Bin Sand. In 1920 difficulties in connection with the question of customs and transit dues in Kuwait induced Bin Saud to place an embargo on trade with Kuwait, as the result of which the prosperity of the principality has been seriously affected. There has been no development of importance in recent years but the position remains unsatisfactory. Shaikh Salim died in February 1921 and was succeeded, in March, by his nephew the present Shaikh Ahmad-al-Jabir who, at the time of his uncle's death, was absent in Nejd on a mission to try and improve the relations between Nejd and Kuwait. The assurances, given to his predecessors, were renewed to him. At a conference, held at Uqair at the end of 1922, between the High Commissioner for Iraq and Bin Saud, at which the Political Agent, Kuwait, was also present, the question of the frontier between Kuwait and Nejd came up for discussion. The southern boundary of the recog nised territory of Kuwait was demarcated (see No. IV), and also a tract of country in which it was agreed that the Rulers of Nejd and Kuwait should enjoy equal rights. In April 1923 the Shaikh of Kuwait was informed (No. XLIT1) through the Political Agent that His Majesty's Government recognised the Iraq-Kuwait frontiers claimed by him. In May 1924 the Sultan of Nejd and the Shaikh of Kuwait jointly granted an oil concession to the Eastern and (xeneral Syndicate, Limited, of London, in respect of the neutral zone between the two principalities. As the Syndicate has not complied with its obligations to commence and carry on operations, * the concession is subject to cancellation and for feiture, if not actually null and void. In October 1925 an Order in Council came into effect providing for British jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners within the prin cipality of Kuwait. The frontier troubles between Iraq and Nejd anrt the rebellion in 1929 of the Ajman and Mutair tribes against Bin Saud {nee 1, The Wah- habis and Nejd), have placed the Shaikh of Kuwait in a difficult positian.206 PERSIAN GULF— Nejd —NOS. 1—1866 &amp; 11—1915.

We, the undersigned. His Highness 'Abdu'l-'Aziz ibn 'Abdu'r Rahman-al- Faisal A1 Sa'ud, Sultan of Nejd and its Dependencies, and Sir Gilbert Clayton, K.B.E., C.B., C.M.G., the duly accredited Commissioner and Plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty's Government, who has been empowered to come to an agreement and sign on behalf of the 'Iraq Government, have agreed upon the following articles :— A rticle 1. The States of 'Iraq and Nejd severally recognise that raiding by tribes settled in their territories into the territory of the other State is an aggression which ne cessitates the severe punishment of the perpetrators by the Government to which they are subject and that the chief of the tribe committing such aggression is to be held responsible. A rticle 2. (a) A special tribunal shall be set up, by agreement between the two Govern ments of 'Iraq and Nejd, which shall meet from time to time to enquire into the particulars of any aggression committed across the frontier between the two States, to assess the damages and losses and to fix the responsibility. This tribunal shall be composed of an equal number of representatives of the Governments of 'Iraq and Nejd, and its presidency shall be entrusted to an additional person, other than the aforesaid representatives, to be selected by the two Governments in agreement. The decisions of this tribunal shall be final and executory. (b) When the tribunal has fixed the responsibility, assessed the damages and losses resulting from the raid, and issued its decision in that respect, the Govern ment to whom those found guilty are subject shall execute the aforesaid decision in accordance with tribal customs, and shall punish the guilty party in accord ance with Article 1 of the present Agreement. A rticle 3. Tribes subject to one of the two Governments may not cross the frontier into the territory of the other Government except after obtaining a permit from their own Government and after the concurrence of the other Government; it being stipulated, however, in accordance with the principle of the freedom of grazing, that neither Government shall have the right to withhold such permit or con currence if the migration of the tribe is due to grazing necessities.216 PERSIAN GULF— Nejd —NO.

The two Governments of 'Iraq and Nejd undertake to stand in the way by all the means at their disposal other than expulsion and the use of force, of the emigration of any tribe or section of a tribe from one of the two countries into the other unless its emigration takes place with the knowledge and consent of its Government. The two Governments undertake to abstain from offering any present of whatsoever kind to refugees from the territories of the other Govern ment, and to look with disfavour on any of their subjects who may seek to entice tribes belonging to the other Government or to encourage them to emigrate from their country into the other country. A rticle 5. The Governments of 'Iraq and Nejd may not correspond with the Chiefs and Sheikhs of tribes subject to the other State on official or political matters. A rticle 6.

A rticle 9. In case a tribe were to emigrate from the territory of one of the two Govern ments into the territory of the other Government and were subsequently to com mit raids' into the territory in which it formerly resided, it will be open to the Government into whose territory this tribe has immigrated to take from it ade quate guarantees on the understanding that, if a similar aggression were to be repeated by the tribe, those guarantees would be liable to confiscation, without prejudice to the punishment to be inflicted by the Government as provided in Article 1, and without prejudice to whatever impositions may be decreed by the tribunal specified in Article 2 of the present Agreement. *PERSIAN GULF— Nejd —NO.

Presented by His Highness the Sultan of Nejd after the sixth meeting to Sir Gilbert Clayton, K.B.E., etc., His Britannic Majesty's Commissioner and Plenipo tentiary. Translation. 1st Pain Thani 1344 {19th October 1925). 1 have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the Government of JSTejd are still of opinion that it is necessary to examine the possibility of extraditing criminals, in the hope of ensuring peace on the frontier and of preventing all dis turbers of the peace effectively. My insistence in this matter is due to the par ticular experience I have, and to my knowledge of desert conditions. My first object is to prevent any rivalry or friction from arising between the two Govern ments, and in this I am actuated by three main motives :—- (а) religion and honour, which compel us to act truthfully and in keeping with our pledges ; (б) our special ties of friendship with His Majesty's Government, which make it incumbent upon us to take a far-sighted view ; (c) our desire to live in peace, quiet and amity with our neighbours the State of 'Iraq. 2. I am of opinion that the Agreement which you presented for discussion this morning, although it may achieve some of the purposes for which we strive, does218 PERSIAN GUTiF— Nejd —NO, V—1925. yet leave the door open to a great number of troublesome incidents of a kind of which we have had cause to complain in the past. In particular, I have submitted to you the following incidents as being of the kind which habitually occur in life in the desert:— (a) what should the attitude of the Nejd Government be if an 'Iraqi tribe having committed a reprehensible crime involving killing and plunder, were to take refuge in Nejd ; and what would the same Government's attitude be if that refugee tribe were to commit the same crime, notwithstanding guarantees being taken from it; [b) what should the attitude of each of the Governments of 'Iraq and of Nejd be if a Nejd tribe, having been punished by the Nejd Govern ment for a raid into 'Iraq, were to take refuge into 'Iraq and then to raid Nejd from 'Iraq, as was done by those tribes who had taken re fuge with Nejd and then gone over to 'Iraq, after the well-known incidents connected with Yusuf Sa'dun ? I beg that you will examine these questions carefully. After considerable experience, I sec no effective way of circumventing the trouble other than that Nejd and 'Iraq should both admit the principle of the surrender of criminals, and that criminals having perpetrated a crime in their country should be prevented from seeking refuge into the other country. Measures based on any other prin ciple would not, in my opinion, shut the door on the dissensions of which we all complain ■; and I ask that this statement of mine should be put on record so that it may be referred to in the future, and so as to set my conscience at rest in case such incidents, of the kind which we deplore and would prevent with all our efforts, were to recur. Usual respects. 'A bdu'l -'A ztz ibn A bdu'r- R ahman ibn S a'ud.

Y our H ighness, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Highness' communication of 1st Rabi Thani (19th October 1925) and I note that Your Highness is of opi- iiion that no agreement is likely to establish secuntv on the frontier and put a stop to raiding which is not based on the principle that either Government at the request of the other Government should return, if necessary by force, any tribes or portions of tribes which may cross over into its territory.iWttiAN GULF— Nejd —NO. V—X926. 219 2. As I have repeatedly informed Your Highness in our conversations, the 'Iraq Government is unable to subscribe to this principle, which it deems contrary to Arab traditions and impracticable of execution. 1 have also informed Your Highness that His Majesty's Government, after careful consideration of the facts and of the views put forward by Your Highness and on your behalf in the past, have reached the same conclusion. That being so, I regret that I am unable to adopt the principle which you recommend. 3. On the other hand, I would point out to Your Highness that the draft Agreement which I presented to you recently goes far towards meeting your own views in the matter, and that in drafting it I have endeavoured as far as possible to reconcile conflicting opinions. It is based on what, in the view ol His Majesty s Government, is just and fair to Iraq and Nejd and to the tribes concerned , and I feel sure that, provided it is loyally carried out, peace and stability on the bor der ought to prevail, and that any disputes arising from the aggressions of tribes, even in such complicated instances as those mentioned by Your Highness, will be capable of settlement without real difficulty by the two Governments of 'Iraq and Nejd acting in sincere co-operation. 4. With regard to Your Highness' misgivings as to the efficacy of an agree ment such as I have proposed, I rely with full confidence on Your Highness re peated assurances of good-will and sincere desire for peace and order on the Iron- tier. 1 have, etc., G ilbert C layton.

Bahra, 31st October 1925. Y our H ighness, I have the honour to recall that in one of our recent conversations I spoke to Your Highness about the necessity of settling the question of loot and losses re ■ suiting from past raids by tribea from 'Iraq and Nejd, and we agreed that it would be necessary to lay down general principles and formulate a procedure for the satisfactory settlement of this question. 2. In accordance with our agreement, Taufiq Bey Suwaidi, the 'Iraq repre sentative, has discussed the question with Sheikh Hafiz and Sheikh Yusuf, and they have come to a preliminary agreement on the subject. I have the honour, therefore, to request that Your Highness may, if you see fit, signify to me your concurrence in the following proposals : {a) That the 'Uqair Conference should be taken as the starting point for reckoning the losses claimed respectively by 'Iraq and Nejd on ac count of the raids which have taken place between that Conference220 PEilSIAN GULF— Nejd —NO. V—3925, and the date of ratification by the 'Iraq Government of the Bahra Agreement. {b) That the tribunal provided for in Article 2 of the Bahra Agreement should be charged with the task of enquiring into the claims of both sides and of assessing compensation due for the losses resulting from raids taking place during the above-mentioned period, without prejudice to the other duties which this tribunal will have to perform in the future. (c) That this tribunal should be assembled and should meet within a period not exceeding six months from the date of the ratification of the Bahra Agreement by the Government of Iraq in accordance with their con- etitutional laws.

From this point, it proceeds in a straight line to the point of intersection of meridian 38°E and parallel 30 o N, leaving all projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan in Nejd territory ; and thence proceeds along meridian 38 0 E to the point of its intersection with parallel 29 0 35'N.

A rticle 6 (a) A special tribunal shall be set up, by agreement between the two Govern ments of Nejd and Trans-Jordan, which shall meet from time to time to enquire into the particulars of any aggression committed across the frontier between the two States, to assess the damages and losses and to fix the responsibility. This tribunal shall be composed of an equal number of representatives of the Govern ments of Nejd and Trans-Jordan, and its presidency shall be entrusted to an addi tional person, other than the aforesaid representatives, to be selected by the two Governments in agreement. The decision of this tribunal shall be final and exe cutory. lb) When the tribunal has fixed the responsibility, assessed the damages and losses resulting from the raid, and issued its decision in that respect, the Govern ment to whom those found guilty are subject shall execute the aforesaid decision in accordance with tribal customs, and shall punish the guilty party in accordance with Article 5 of the present Agreement. A rticle 7. Tribes subject to one of the two Governments may not cross the frontier into the territory of the other Government except after obtaining a permit from their own Government and after the concurrence of the other Government; it being stipulated, however, in accordance with the principle of the freedom of grazing, that neither Government shall have the right to withhold such permit or con currence if the migration of the tribe is due to grazing necessities. A rticle 8. The two Governments of Nejd and Trans-Jordan undertake to stand in the w a y, by all the means at their disposal other than expulsion and the u»e of force, of the emigration of any tribe or section of a tribe from one of the two countries into the other unless its emigration takes place with the knowledge and consent of its Government. The two Governments undertake to abstain from offering any present of whatsoever kind to refugees from the territories of the other Gov ernment, and to look with disfavour on any of their subjects who may seek to224 PERSIAN GULF— Nejd —NO, VI—1925. entice tribes belonging to the other Government or to encourage them to emigrate from their country into the other country.

Y our E xcellency, In the Agreement relating to Trans-Jordan and Nejd provision is made for an undertaking on our part not to fortify Kaf or to make it a military centre. In one of our conversations, I asked Your Excellency to elucidate the meaning of ' fortifications and you explained that the construction of a wall round the villages concerned, according to the custom prevailing in the desert for the pre vention of thefts and raids, as well as the construction of a military barracks for the housing of Public Security troops and the placing of a gun or a few machine- guns according to the requirements of public security, would not be considered as being fortifications of the kind which we undertook to abstain from erecting but that such works would be considered as necessary for the preservation of order. The object of the present letter is to obtain clear confirmation of that from Your Excellency so that we should be perfectly explicit about our undertakings and leave no room for such misconstructions as might arise from the intrigues of mis chief-makers.

B ahra C amp, 2nd November 1925. Y our H ighness, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th Rabi' Thani 1344 (1st November 1925) relating to the interpretation of Article 2 of the Hadda Agreement. In reply to Your Highness' enquiry, I would confirm the verbal statement I made in a recent conversation with Your Highness, namely, that it is difficult for anyone to define, fully and in detail, what is to be understood by the word ' fortification ' in such a manner as to cover all possible eventualities ; and that the best interpretation of that Article would be that which conforms to the spirit as to the letter of the Agreement, and rests on a sincere execution of its terms. For instance, if you desire to erect a wall, as is usual, or barracks for Public Secu rity men other than military forces, or a small gun or a few machine-guns intended to repel brigands and aggressors, it will undoubtedly be open to you to do so, pro vided such preparations do not exceed the bounds of what is required for the main tenance of order, and do not constitute, in the judgment of the British military authorities, a menace to Trans-Jordan. I have, etc., G ilbert C layton, His Highness Sultan 'Abdul-Aziz ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman al-Faisal Al Sa'ud, Sultan 0 .f Nejd and its Dependencies, to Sir Gilbert Clayton, K.B.E., etc., His Britannic Majesty's Commissioner and Plenipotentiary.

Y our E xcellence, With reference to the discussions which have taken place concerning traders who are subjects of Trans-Jordan, I am not aware of an established and customary road used for passage through the Wadi Sirhan by traders from Trans-Jordan. Should it appear, however, that subjects of Trans-Jordan have an established and acknowledged right, recognised by those who are expert in such matters, to ply their trade from Syria and Frans-Jordan to the southern portions of Trans- Jordan by way of the Wadi Sirhan, then we hereby undertake to extend to them the same treatment as is extended to subjects of Nejd by the Government of Trans- Jordan in their transit to and from Syria.

I would add that His Britannic Majesty's Govern ment will be prepared to consider the abolition of the right of manumission as soon as it becomes clear to both parties that the co-operation stipulated in article 8 of the Treat} of Jeddah has resulted in the enforcement of such practical mea sures as to render the exercise of the right of manumission no longer necessary.

In continuation of previous letter intimating the out-break of war between the British Government and Turkey, I am ordered by the British Government to convey to Your Excellency gratitude for your loyalty and your offer of assistance, and to request you to attack Umm Qasr, Safwan and Bubiyan and to occupy them. You should endeavour, afterwards, in co-operation with Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan, Amir Abdul Aziz bin Saud and other reliable Shaikhs to liberate Basrah from Turkish possession. Should this prove to be beyond your ability, you should make arrangements, if possible, to prevent Turkish reinforcements from reaching Basrah or even Qurnah, until the arrival of the British troops whom we shall send, please God, as soon as possible. I also hope that two of our men-of-war will reach Basrah before the arrival of your troops there. And though it should be your highest aim, in this connection, to liberate Basrah and its people from Turkish rule, still we request that you should use your utmost endeavour in preventing troops and others from plundering the merchandise belonging to British merchants in Basrah and its dependencies, to protect the European residents of Basrah and to safeguard them from loss and oppression. In return for your valuable assistance in this important matter, I am ordered by the British Government to promise to Your Excellency that if we succeed therein—and we shall succeed therein, please God,—we will not return Basrah to the Turkish Government and we will not surrender it back to them at all. Furthermore I make to you, on behalf of the British Government, certain promises concerning Your Excellency personally viz.:— (1) that your gardens which are now in your possession, viz., the date gardens situate between Fao and Qurnah shall remain in your posses sion and in possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of revenue or taxes. (2) that if you attack Safwan, Umm Qasr and Bubiyan and occupy them the British Government will protect you from any consequences arising from that action.266 PERSIAN GULF— Knvnit NOS.

Shaikh Ahmed at the same time claims as appertaining to Kuwait the Islands of Warbah, Bubiyan, Maskan (or Mashjan), Failakah, Auha, Kubha Qaru and Um-el-Maradim.

Treaties and Engagements relating to Oman (Muscat). IN the middle of the seventeenth century the Muscat Arabs, having driven the Portnguese, who had occupied the Oman coast since 1507, from Muscat, established their ascendency in the Persian Gulf and, by the end of the century, had gained possession of Mombasa and other ports on the African coast. In the reign of Nadir Shah the Persians invaded Oman and gained supremacy over the country for some time, but were eventually expelled by Ahmad bin Said, the Arab Governor of Sohar, a town on the Batinah coast about 150 miles north-west of Muscat, who contemptuously rejected Nadir Shah's claims to tribute. For this service Ahmad was elected Imam in 1741 and founded the present dynasty of the A1 Bu Saidis. He died in 1775 and was succeeded by his second son Said who, however, proved an incapable ruler, and ten years later the power was usurped by the fifth son. Sultan. It was in 1798, during the rule of this Imam, that the first Treaty (No. I) with Muscat was negotiated by the Company's Agent at Bushire, with a view to exclude from Muscat the prejudicial influence of the French, with whom Saiyid Sultan was brought in contact through his trade with Mauritius. When Sir John Malcolm visited'Muscat on his first mission to Persia in 1800, he formed another Engagement (No. II) with Saiyid Sultan, stipulating for the strict observance of the previous treaty and for the residence of an English gentleman in an official capacity at Muscat. Saiyid Sultan bin Ahmad was killed in 1804 in a contest at sea with his enemies, the Atbis and Qawasim. The rights of his two young sons were disputed by their uncles, especially by Saiyid Qais of Sohar, who aimed at usurping the government of Oman. To oppose their uncle^ s pretensions the two youths put themselves in the hands of their cousin Saiyid Badar bin Saif, who called in the ahhabis, and with their help defeated Saiyid Qais and recovered Bandar Abbas and Hormuz, which had been seized by the Shaikh of Qishm. The weakness resulting from this disputed succession gave the Wahhabis a footing in Muscat which ( 269 )270 OMAN (MUSCAT). ■ i ; ■ they retained until the occupation of ITasa by the Turks. In J 800 thev made their first appearance in Oman. They reduced all the sea -coast of the Persian Gulf from Basrah to Dibai, released the Shaikhs of Zahira and Sohar from allegiance to Muscat, and forced Saiyid Sultan to beg for a three years' truce, which they broke soon after. They would probably have conquered all Oman if they had not been stopned by the assassination of their Amir. Saiyid Said, the second son of Saiyid Sultan, succeeded Badar bin Saif in 1807 but the religious title of Imam was not conceded bv the Arabs to him. He ruled for fifty years, during which time he cultivated a close intercourse with the British Government. In 1808, smarting under the insults of the Wahhabis whose agents were forcibly converting his subjects in his very capital, he roused the Arab tribes in Oman to a combination against them. If Muscat had fallen under the Wahhabis, Saiyid Said would have been drawn into the general system of piracy which they encouraged, and would have been converted from a friend into a dangerous enemy. The British Government, therefore, resolved to support him. An armament was accordingly sent towards the close of 1809, which destroyed the piratical boats at Ras -al-Khaimah, Lingeh. and Laft, and bombarded and took Shinas. ]S T o arrangements, how ever, were made to secure permanently the advantage then obtained. Piracy was soon renewed, and it became necessary to send another expedition against the pirates in 1819, in which also Saiyid Said co operated. With these exceptions, till the year 1822, when a Treatv (No. Ill) was concluded for the suppression of slavery, there is nothing requiring special notice in the intercourse between the British Govern ment and Saiyid Said, who was chiefly occupied in wars with his rivals, the Qawasm, and m fruitless attempts to possess himself of the island of Bahrain. The treaty of 1822 aimed at the suppression of the foreign slave trade with Christian nations only, and not of the trade with Muhammadan (Oiiutnes and within the Muscat dominions, except in cases of kidnap- ping; and the permission, given under the treatv to British cruisers to seize slave ships east of the line defined in the treaty, applied to His Majesty s ships only and not to vessels of the Indian Navy ■ In 1839 however a Treaty o Commerce (No. IV) was concluded with Saiyid Said hy Her Majesty s Tlempotentiary at Muscat, by the 16th article of which he confirmed the treaty of 1822 for the suppression of the slave trade ve N o7th!V o rT ; s ' r 1 co,iceded ,&gt;ower &lt;•* ^ ^ ^ to r, 1. 1 ffu Company as well as those of the Royal Navy.

In the fourth article of the Arabic version of the treaty of 1822 no mention was made of the obligation of the Sultan of Muscat or his authorities to assist in the apprehension of British subjects engaged in the slave trade, although this obligation was distinctly specified in the English version. lie was therefore urged to have the omission rectified b.) ai1 addition to the Arabic text. He was, however, averse from altera tion being made in the treaty; but in a separate letter, dated the 18th August 1845, he bound himself, his heirs and authorities to afford assistance, when required by persons authorised to demand it, in appre hending British subjects engaged in the slave trade. In 1845 Saiyid Said entered into a Treaty* (No. VI) prohibiting, from the 1st January 1847, the export of slaves from his African dominions, and their importation from any part of Africa into his dominions in Asia; and agreeing to use his influence with the Shaikhs of Arabia, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf to put a stop to the slave trade. The treaty, however, did not prohibit the transport of slaves from one port in his African possessions to another. In consenting to this treaty he requested that three additional articlest might be added, prohibiting the search of his vessels in the limits within which the transport of slaves was allowed under the treaty, and of his vessels coming from the Arabian and Red Seas to Africa; and stipulating that, if slaves were stolen from the Zanzibar territories, he should not be held responsible. These articles do not appear to have been formally agreed to; but Saiyid Said was informed, in the name of Her Majesty's Government, that British ships of war would search only such vessels under the Muscat flag as might reasonably be suspected of being engaged in the slave trade; that, there fore, the description of vessels mentioned in the articles would not be searched unless there should be good ground for suspecting them to be so engaged; and that, in any case, if they should be searched and found not to be so engaged, that fact would be ascertained in a very short space re ,^ n P ar hament. 11 and 12 Vict., Cap.

In consequence of some discussion regarding the right of Saiyid Said to duty on goods transhipped in his ports, he issued 'Rules (No. YII) in 1846 for the levy of the full duty of 5 per cent, on goods transhipped, but exempting from duty ships putting into his harbours from stress of weather, and all stores of the British Government landed at his ports. In 1854 Saiyid Said ceded (No. VIII) to the British Crown the Kuria Muria islands on the south coast of Arabia. The islands were valuable only for the guano deposits which were found on them and which are now exhausted. In 1874 a piratical outrage was committed by the Jaaferah section of the Bani Bu Ali tribe on two trading vessels at Hallaniyah in these islands, for which they were fined 000 dollars, and a promise of future good behaviour was exacted from them, During the later years of his rule the affairs of Saiyid Said in his Asiatic dominions fell into much confusion, owing partly to his prolonged residence at Zanzibar, which in 1840 he made the permanent seat of his government, and partly to the incapacity of the agents whom he left at Muscat, and latterly of his son Saiyid Thuwaini. On more than one occasion his power was saved only by the intervention of the British Gov ernment. His contests with the Wahhabis in 1832 and again in 1845 and 1852 are described in Part II of this volume. In 1833 Saiyid Said concluded a treaty with the United States of America,* and in 1844 with France.t In 1880 a Consul for the former and in 1881 a Consular Agent for the latter were appointed. I he American Consulate was closed in 1915 and the French Consulate in 1920. Saiyid Said died in 1856. In 1844 he had intimated his desire to appoint his sons, Saiyid Majid and Saiyid Thuwaini, as his successors in his African and Asiatic dominions respectively, and had appointed them his deputies. Saiyid Thuwaini accordingly succeeded to the gov ernment of Muscat on his father's death, and Saiyid Majid to that of Zanzibar. In virtue of his •succession to Oman, Saiyid Thuwaini claimed also feudal supremacy over Zanzibar, and prepared to establish his claim by force of arms. The dispute was submitted to the arbitration of Lord Canning, who in 1861 decided (No. IX) that Zanzibar should l)e independent of Muscat, but should pay an annual subsidy of 40,000 crowns. A rticm 3. • It is known that the vessels belonging to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and those oelongmg to his subjects coming from the Arabian and Red Seas do not bring slaves Irom those parts to the territories of the Sultan of Muscat which are m Africa, accordingly English men-of-war shall not search nor trouble them. * See Appendix No. T. t See Appendix No. II.OMAN (MUSCAT). 273 In 1862 an Engagement (No. X) was concluded between Great Britain and France, by which both powers engaged reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar. In 1864 Saiyid Thnwaini agreed (No. XI) to the construction of one or more lines of telegraph through the territory of Muscat: and in 1865 a Convention (No. XII) was made with him for the extension of the telegraph through his dominions in Arabia and Makran. In February 1866 Saiyid Thuwaini was assassinated at Sohar, where he had gone to organise an expedition against the Wahhabis. Grave suspicions of having been concerned in this crime attached to his son and successor Saiyid Salim: and so much alarm was created at Muscat that trade was paralysed and the town was deserted by British subjects residing there. Envoys were shortly afterwards sent by Saiyid Salim to Bombay; but they were informed that, while the British Government had no wish to interfere in the domestic affairs of Oman, they were compelled, in the circumstances of the case, to suspend friendly relations with the Sultan of Muscat. At the same time, the ireaty obligations of the British Government with the State of Muscat, which had for their special object the protection of British subjects residing in Muscat terri tory, were in no way abrogated, and their fulfilment would be required from every Sultan of Muscat. Subsequently, however, as the people of Muscat had apparently ac cepted Saiyid Salim as their legitimate Sultan, it was intimated to the merchants trading with Muscat that they might resume commercial deal ings with that port: and finally in September 1866, Saiyid Salim was recognised by the British Government as Sultan of the State. The appointment of a British Officer as Political Agent was revived in the following year. In the meantime Saiyid Turki, brother of Saiyid Thuwaini, who had been residing at Bushire on an allowance granted to him by the British Government pending a settlement of Oman affairs, made an unsuccessful attack on Muscat. For this breach of the maritime peace his allowance was stopped : and he was subsequently warned that similar proceedings, which he was believed to be meditating in concert with the Shaikh of Dibai, would expose him and his adherents to be treated as enemies of the British Government. In June 1867 Saiyid Turki attacked Sohar by land, but was driven off with loss ; subsequently, however, he captured Matrah, the principal fort commanding the pass leading to Muscat: and, as Saiyid Salim was unable to expel him, an arrangement was effected through the mediation of the British Resident, by which Saiyid Turki was to receive a monthly allowance of 600 dollars from Saiyid Salim, on the condition that he should reside in India. u 2274 OMAN (MUSCAT). Saiyid Salim's rule, however, was not destined to last lon^. In addi tion to the suspicion of parricide, from which he could never entirely free himself, his preference for ihe Ghafiri tribe, who professed Wahhabi tenets, excited the discontent of their rivals the Hinawis, by whom the ruling- family of Muscat had been principally supported. Early in 1868 an expedition was undertaken by Saiyid Salim against his uncle, the Shaikh of Masnaah, with whom he had a trifling dispute regarding money. Although a reconciliation was effected before hostilities actually began, Saiyid Salim's conduct on this occasion alienated manv whose support would have been valuable, while his resources were materially diminished by the expenses of the expedition. When, therefore, Azzan bin Qais, Chief of Rustaq and brother -in-law of Saiyid Salim, rose in rebellion, the latter had neither friends nor money with which to resist him. In October 18G8 Azzan bin Qais obtained possession of the town of Muscat and, on the flight of Saiyid Salim, whom the British Government declined to assist by force of arms, was pro claimed Sultan. For some time Saiyid Salim endeavoured to rally his friends on the Arab coast and contemplated an attack by sea on the Oman ports. He was warned, however, against any act which might tend to a breach of the maritime peace : and Government resolved to prohibit, by force of arms if necessary, all naval operations by any party at Muscat or elsewhere. 1 he hope which Saiyid Salim entertained of assistance from the Wahhabis was frustrated by the assassination at Shargah of Sadairi, Governor ol the Wahhabi outpost of Uaraimi, and by his own exertions he could excite no enthusiasm for his cause among the Shaikhs of the Arab coast. During the rule of Azzan bin Qais the chief power was wielded by Said bin Khalfan A1 Khalili, the head of the priestly faction among the Tlinawis; his cruelties and exactions, and the severity with which he enforced compliance with the precepts of the Koran, rendered Azzan bin Qais rule unpopular at Muscat, though his authority was successfully asserted over the refractory tribes in the interior. Early in 1869 the Wahhabi Amir Abdulla bin Faisal made a demand for tribute on Azzan bin Qais. io this no attention was paid : and, on the invitation of the Naim tribe of Bedouins, who had suffered from the oppression of Sadairi, Azzan bin Qais attacked Baraimi in June 1809 and captured it. Pre parations for its recapture were at once set on foot by the Wahhabi Amir, in whose possession it had remained for many vears previously: and in the first month of 1870 he was reported to be advancing on Baraimi with a considerable force. Difficulties connected with the want of water en route, the anticipated hostility of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, who was known to be in alliance with Azzan bin Qais, and the intrigues of his brother Saud bin Faisal, combined to deter the Wahhabi Amir from carrying his intentions into effect: and before the close of the year he was a fugitive, pursued by his successful brother Saud.OMAN (MUSCAT). •275 In the meantime the events which had taken place in Oman induced Government to withdraw its prohibition against Saiyid Tnrki's inter ference in the affairs of Oman: and in March 3869 he was informed that he might, if lie should so wish, proceed to Muscat, but that no help or protection could be afforded him by the British Government in any attempts he might make to establish his power in Oman, and that no operations by sea would be permitted. Saiyid Turki remained at Bombay till March 1870, when he proceeded to Bandar Abbas and thence to the Arab coast. He was at first unsuccessful and was obliged to return to Bandar Abbas. In the following September, however, assisted with funds from Zanzibar, he again landed on the Arab coast with a few followers and soon collected a considerable force, a portion of which he placed under the command of Saif bin Sulaiman. In January 1871 Saif bin Sulaiman attacked Azzan bin Qais at Matrah. Both the leaders fell in the engagement; but an armistice was arranged through the interven tion of the British Resident, and eventually negotiations between Saiyid Turki and Said bin Khalfan ended in a declaration of peace between the contending parties. Said bin Khalfan died a few days afterwards. Saiyid Turki's principal opponent was now Ibrahim bin Qais, brother of Azzjan bin Qais, who held the fort of Sohar. In July 1871 Saiyid Turki laid siege to Sohar and had effected a practicable breach, when an arrangement was concluded by which Ibrahim bin Qais retained posses sion of Sohar and the portion of coast from Sallan to Khaburah, a tract of some 30 miles in extent; and all other parts of the coast, including Suwaiq and Masnaah, were made over to Saiyid Turki. Soon after wards Ibrahim bin Qais plundered a native craft belonging to British traders and imprisoned three of the owners. As Saiyid Turki was un able to procure redress, the Ilesident in the Persian Gulf was directed to demand restitution of the plundered property and compensation for the imprisonment of British subjects, and in ca«se of refusal to bombard Sohar. These claims, amounting to 2,255 dollars, were accordingly paid by Ibrahim bin Qais. Saiyid Turki was recognised by the British Government as Sultan of Muscat in June 1871; but during that and the succeeding year his power was endangered by the intrigues of his brother Saiyid Abdul Aziz, and his nephew Saiyid Salim, in addition to the persistent hostility of Ibrahim bin Qais. A coalition was proposed in April 1872 between Ibrahim bin Qais and Saiyid Salim, but failed owing to the defeat of the former near Liwa and the desertion of the latter by his followers. Find ing themselves unable to subvert Saiyid Turki s authority, his bi other and nephew quitted Muscat territory towards the close of 1872 and pro ceeded to Bombay. In the spring of 1873 they left Bombay and began to intrigue against Saiyid Turki's authority in Makran. Offers had been made to them by Saiyid Turki of an allowance of 300 dollais a month on condition of their residing in India and abstaining from interference•276 OMAN (MUSCAT). iii Muscat affairs. These offers they declined, and in July of that year ftaiyid Abdul Aziz moved on Gwadar. The attack failed, but a consi derable amount of property belonging - to J5ritish subjects was plundered Saiyid Abdul Aziz was afterwards captured in an attempt to cross over to Oman, and detained in surveillance at Karachi. On his undertaking not to interfere in Muscat affairs or leave Karachi without permission he u as set at liberty, and the allowance of oOO dollars a month was paid to linn through the British Government. Gwadar was again attacked in December 187-3, on this occasion by Saiyid Salim; the attempt, however, failed, and Saiyid Salim escaped into Persian territory. He was then informed that, if he surrendered unconditionally, he would be granted the same allowances as Saiyid Abdul Aziz; otherwise the offer would nut be renewed, and he would be arrested wherever lie might be found. He subsequently made another attempt on Oman, was arrested by H. M. S. Daphne, and sent as a State prisoner to the fort of Hyderabad in Sind, where he died in December 1870. In June 1873 Saiyid Turki undertook active operations against Ibrahim bin Qais and invested Sohar. Negotiations were entered into which resulted in the surrender of Sohar and other places on the coast to Saiyid Turki; Ibrahim bin Qais receiving a sum of 5,000 dollars and a monthly allowance of 100 dollars on condition of not moving eastward of the iort of Hibi. In spite of this reverse, Ibrahim bin Qais continued to intrigue against Saiyid Turki, and in March 1874 collected a force composed principally of the Yal Saad section of the Hinawis, with which re attacked Masnaah and took possession of the fort after having p undeied &lt;i consideiable amount of property belonging to liritish sub- jects. As Ibrahim bin Qais refused to evacuate the fort at the demand of t lie Political Agent, it was bombarded, and an indemnity of 10,000 dollars as compensation to British subjects was exacted from the Yal U ' 11 lllean f 11116 Saiyid lurki had hardly returned from his suc- cessful expedition against Sohar when he was compelled to make terms ti ai bin Ali A1 Harithi, Azzan bin Qais' former minister, who made a successful attack on Matrah and was only induced to withdraw by the payment of a large sum of money. + ' su ^ J dy which, under the terms of Lord Canning's arbi- ra ion, the Sultan of Zanzibar was bound to pay to the Sultan of Mus cat was duly paid up to the date of Saiyid Thuwaini's death in 1866, aiju ajid, who was then Sultan of Zanzibar, objected to continue the subsidy to Saiyid Thuwaini's successor, Saiyid Salim, partly on the pietext that the engagement was personal to Saiyid Thuwaini, and partly on the ground of Saiyid Salim's alleged parricide. These argu- nen s admitted by the British Government, who had recognised Saiyid Salim as Sultan of Muscat; but an arrangement was effected by which the subsidy was to be paid through the medium of the Political Agent in Oman.OMAN (MUSCAT). 277 On the expulsion of Saiyid Salim by Azzan bin Qais, Saiyid Majid again declined to pay the subsidy, on the ground that a member of another branch of the family had succeeded to power. This plea ceased to have force when Saiyid Turki had succeeded in establishing his authority, and he appealed to the British Government to procure the due observance of the terms of the arbitration. As the great obstacle to the consolidation of Saiyid Turki's power and the establishment of a peace ful administration in Oman was his want of funds, it was determined to guarantee to him the payment of the subsidy, with arrear from the date of his succession to power; and an assurance was conveyed to him in 1873 that, so long as he continued faithfully to observe his treaty engagements and manifest his friendship towards the British Govern ment, ihe subsidy of 40,000 crowns would be paid to him annually during his rule. In accordance with this guarantee, the payment was regularly made and, after the death of Saiyid Turki in 1888, the sub sidy was continued to his successors always on the understanding and with the provisos under which it was paid to Saiyid Turki. The greater portion of the money thus received by Saiyid Turki was spent in subsidising the various tribes in the interior; but the successful, raid of Salih bin Ali showed how little reliance could be placed on their allegiance, and illustrated the real weakness of Saiyid Turki's authority in Oman. As a means of maintaining his position Saiyid Turki sought a reconciliation with his brother Saiyid Abdul Aziz. Terms were finally arranged between the brothers, and Saiyid Abdul Aziz was permitted to proceed to Muscat and was associated with Saiyid Turki in the govern ment of the country. The difficulties, however, with which Saiyid Turki had to contend did not disappear with the arrival of his brother: and Saiyid Turki, after an ineffectual attempt to conduct affairs unaided, entrusted the government to Saiyid Abdul Aziz and retired temporarily to Gwadar. Signs of opposition to the administration of Saiyid Abdul Aziz soon became apparent: and, within a few months of his retirement, Saiyid Turki found himself in a position to return to Muscat. In December 1875, in the absence of Saiyid Abdul Aziz, he once more took possession of the town and forts: and by February 1876 he had completed the re- establishment of his authority, Ibrahim bin Qais alone remaining inde pendent at the stronghold of Rustaq. In 1879 Saiyid Turki, at the invitation of the Shaikhs, sent an expe dition to Dhufar from which the notorious Moplah usurper, Saiyid Fadhl, had lately been expelled by the inhabitants. The district was occupied by Saiyid Turki's troops: and, although two unsuccessful attempts were made by the inhabitants in 1881 and 1888 to overthrow the Sultan's rule, it still forms part of his dominions.278 OMAN (MUSCAT). In Junuaiy 1880 the Sultan gave Lis assent to the adoption of the rules and regulations for preventing collisions at sea, etc., as published at page 81, Part I, of the Gazette of India of Ihe 31st January 1880, so far as Muscat vessels are concerned. In 1880 the British Government declared publicly their determination to afford Saiyid Turki active support in case of attacks on Muscat, which had the salutary effect of maintaining peace during the remainder of his life. Saiyid Turki died in 1888 leaving three sons, Muhammad, Faisal and Fahad. The second, Saiyid Faisal, who had already taken a share in the administration of the State during his father's lifetime, and had shown an aptitude for government, assumed power and proclaimed himself Sultan of Oman, immediately on his father's death. In September 1888 Saiyid Faisal undertook active operations against Saiyid Ibrahim bin Qais with a view to reduce Rustaq, but the attempt ended in total failure. Saiyid Abdul Aziz made several attempts to overthrow Saiyid Faisal, but the latter successfully maintained Iris position and established himself in power. In 1890 Saiyid Faisal was recognised as Sultan by the British Government, and in the same year Saiyid Abdul Aziz with- drew to Bombay. In 1891 the Sultan of Zanzibar offered him an allowance of lis. GOO a month, on the express conditions that he did not attempt to go 1o Zanzibar, or to apply to the Sultan for more money. IFe was advised by the Government of India to accept this offer, and was warned against disturbing the peace of either Zanzibar or Oman. Bandar Abbas was formerly held by the Sultans of Muscat on lease iioin 1 ersia, but the lease was resumed in 18G8 and has not since been renewed. Besides their possessions on the Arabian coast, the Sultans of Muscat have held uninterrupted possession of the port of Gwadar since the close of the eighteenth century when, according to native tradition, it was conferred by Nasir Khan, Khan of Kalat, on Saiyid Sultan who had fled fiom Muscat after an unsuccessful attempt to subvert the authority of bis hi other Saiyid Said. When Azzan bin Qais succeeded to power in Muscat in 18G8, he sent Saiyid Saif as his Governor to Gwadar, but his fanatical opinions disgusted the inhabitants and he had to give way to Nasir bin Thuwaini. After Saiyid Turki's success at Muscat in 1871, his biother Saiyid Abdul Aziz established himself at Gwadar, and subsequently seized the port of Chahbar, which had also been for manv \(ais in the possession of the Sultans of Muscat, but had been occupied by Din Muhammad, Shaikh of Dashtyari, about 1871. The Persians, however, who had long asserted a claim to sovereignty ovei Ohahbar, attacked and took it in February 1872 and expelled Abdul Aziz, while Saiyid Turki availed himself of this opportunity to make himself master of Gwadar, and has ever since retained possession of it. No intervention was made by the British Government in the proceedingsOMAN (MUSCAT). 279 of the Persian authorities; but in the attack on Chalibar property beloiig'iiig to British subjects was plundered, for which compensation was afterwards paid by Persia. In November 18G7 an Order in Council was issued making suitable provision for the exercise of Consular jurisdiction in Muscat. In May 1871 Saiyid Turki issued a Proclamation prohibiting the import of slaves into Muscat by sea, and in April 1873 Sir Bartle Frere, who had been deputed as Her Majesty's Special Envoy to effect arrange ments for the more effectual suppression of the slave trade, concluded a formal Treaty (No. XIII) with him, by which he engaged for himself, his heirs and successors, to prohibit absolutely the import or export of slaves within his territories, to abolish all public slave markets, and to confer freedom on all slaves entering his territories. It was moreover consi dered desirable that subjects of Indian States residing in Muscat should, like British subjects under the Treaty of 1889 (No. IV) and the Order in Council of 1867, be amenable to the jurisdiction of the Political Agent and Consul. An Agreement (No. XIV) to this effect was signed by Saiyid Turki. In 1875 Saiyid Turki consented (No. XV) to observe the customs rules issued by Sultan Said in 184() [see No. VII), and to forego the duty in cases where the cargo might be transhipped to another vessel. In 1877 a commercial declaration was exchanged between Muscat and Holland.* In 1891 a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation (No. XVI), superseding the Treaty of 1839 (No, IV), was concluded between the British Government and the Sultan of Muscat. There was not in the new treaty any material departure from the spirit of the old, which it was expressly declared to supersede; but it con tained a new provision by which the Sultan was debarred from prohibit ing the import or export of any particular article, and the levy of export taxes was made conditional upon the consent of the British Government. The treaty was to remain in force for 12 years absolutely, and was to be subject to revision at any time thereafter on the expiration of twelve months' notice given by either party. In March 1891 the Sultan issued a Proclamation prohibiting the im port into Gwadar and its dependencies of arms and ammunition. About the same time the Sultan signed a Declaration (No. XVII) binding himself and his successors not to cede any portion of his dominions to any power other than the British Government. In 1895 certain Shaikhs of the Hinawi tribes rose in rebellion against the Sultan of Muscat, and seized the palace and the greater portion of the town. After three weeks' desultory fighting, the Sultan came to terms * See Appendix No. IV.280 OMAN (MUSCAT). with the rebels, who evacuated the town. The damage done to British Indian property was assessed at $177,000, and an indemnity of this amount was demanded. It was finally liquidated in 1900. In 1895 the Sultan notified the leading Shaikhs of Oman of the decision of the British Government that, in view of the important British interests in the towns of Muscat and Matrah, they would not permit an attack on these towns by the Shaikhs whatever differences the latter might have with the Sultan. This warning was reiterated in slightly different form in 1913. In December 1895 a rebellion broke out at Dhufar, where the rebels obtained possession of the town and province. Finding himself unable to regain possession, the Sultan asked the British Government to help him to recover his position. The 1'olitical Resident, with the Lawrence and Bossack, proceeded to Dhufar, whither 400 troops under Saiyid Muhamad bin Turki were also despatched. The rebels came to terms and handed over possession without bloodshed. In 1898 the Sultan agreed to co-operate with the British and Persian Governments in the suppression of the illegal importation of arms into British India and Persia, and issued a Proclamation authorising British and Persian men-of-war to search in Muscat waters vessels flying the British, Persian or Muscat flags, and to confiscate arms proved to be destined for British Indian and Persian ports. In 1897 the Sultan granted a lease to the French Government of the harbour of Bandar Jissah, about seven miles south of Muscat, as a coaling O station. (Jn the receipt of a protest from the British Government against this action as constituting a breach of the Sultan's treaty engagements, he decided to cancel the lease. The matter was satisfactorily settled by the grant to the French Government of a moiety of the area of the British coal depot in the Makallah cove of Muscat harbour. In 1921 the French Government renounced their rights in it to the Sultan, who granted the use of the site to the British Government. In 1899 the attention of the Sultan was drawn to the extent to which the practice of granting I rench flags, and therewith a claim to French protection, to Omani subjects had increased. The use of French flags by the people of Sur had gradually become so prevalent as to constitute a serious encroachment on the integrity and independence of Oman. Accordingly in February 1899 the Sultan wrote to the French flag holders in Sur enjoining them to give up their flags: and at the same time informed the French Vice-Consul at Muscat that he did not recognize the right of the I rench to exercise jurisdiction over Omani subjects in Oman. During a visit which the Sultan paid to Sur in the following year the Suri French flag holders spontaneously presented himOMAN (MUSCAT). 281 with a written agreement* in which they renounced the benefits of French protection, and undertook to return the French flags and certi ficates in their possession to the authorities from whom they had received them. The Sultan formally taccepted this undertaking and issued a * Translation of document voluntarily passed by the Jannabah and Bani Abu Ali, French flag holders at Sur, in which tliey express their wish and intention to relinquish French protection from date, dated 12th June 1900— Let it be known to all who see these words that we, natives of Sur, who have been domiciled in the place from the days of our fathers and forefathers, consider ourselves the subjects of His Highness Sultan Feysal-bin-Turki-bin-Saeed, we are his vassals and under his protection, and we wish to render him that loyalty and obedience which it is the duty of subjects (to render to their sovereign); accordingly those of us who have taken French flags will return them to that Government at the beginning of the coming year (that is, when season re-opens after monsoon), and, moreover, if their Consul (at Muscat) will accept thein from us, we are ready to return them at once in order to save ourselves the incon venience and loss of time (which would result if we took them to Zanzibar, etc.).

And, furthermore, having understood your wishes and agreed to fall in with them, I now intimate in return, on my own account, to you and all my subjects, that, whereas there appears to have been in time past a misunderstanding among you as to my wishes in this connection there must be nothing of the sort in the future, you must there fore, clearly understand that from to-day I neither recognise nor permit that any subject of mine, no matter who he may be, should take so-called protection papers and flags frciu the French Government or any Government whatever28^5 OMAN (MUSCAl 1 ). ProclamationJ refusing to recognise in his territory foreign flags and papers given to his subjects without permission. This proclamation was to have effect from after the date of its communication to the French Consul, and did not therefore debar those already in possession of the French flag from continuing to make use of it. The question reached an acute stage in 1903, when a French flag holder belonging to Sur, who had arrived at Muscat and who was subject to quarantine, broke quaran tine himself and absconded, after abducting two followers from the quarantine station. The matter was then taken up in London by the French Ambassador and, as a result of negotiations between the liritisli and French Govern ments, was referred to the Hague Tribunal whose decision, published on the 8th August 1905, was as follows: — 1. That before the § 2mi January 1892, France was entitled to authorise vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules; 2. That owners of dhows, who before 1892, had been authorised hy France to fly the French flag, retained this authorisation as long as France renewed it to the grantee; and 3. That after the 2nd January 1892, France was not entitled to authorise vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness tlie Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners, or fitters-out, had established, or should establish, that they had been con sidered and treated by France as her ' proteges ' before the year 1863;ll without my special written permission and in accordance with the treaties exist ing between me and Foreign Powers.

The award of the Hague Tribunal was considered as generally satis factory, and the French Government instructed their Consul at Muscat to prepare a list of French proteges for communication to the British Consul and to discuss with him the manner of announcing the award. In 11)00 a question arose as to the exact interpretation of article fi (1) of the Treaty of 1891. Under the provisions of this article exemption from payment of duty could be claimed on goods destined for tranship ment or re -exportation, provided that a declaration to this effect was made on the arrival of the ship and that the goods were handed over to be kept under customs seal. The Sultan of Muscat contended bat goods consigned to Muscat in the manifest of the vessel, with discretion as to disposal on arrival, were not exempted from customs duty if re exported or transhipped. It was, however, eventually agreed that there should he no rule requiring that goods to he transhipped or re-exported should be so declared in the manifest, and that the real intent of the Treaty would be secured if the agents observed the procedure prescribed in article 6 (1) of the Treaty. In November 1901 Muscat was put in cable connection with the outer world via J ask. In 1902 the British Government obtained from the Sultan an Engage ment (No XVIII) that he would not grant a concession for working the coal -fields in the hinterland of Sur to any foreign government or company until an opportunity had been given to the British Government of under taking the work in conjunction with the Sultan himself. In um:', the Sultan issued a notification prohibiting the export ot arms and ammunition into the British and Italian protectorates in Africa. In 1905 a London Company ' the Sponge Exploration Syndicate Limited ' obtained from the Sultan of Muscat, for a period of fifteen years, a concession to fish for sponges in the territorial waters ot Oman. In 1919 a notification was issued by the Sultan prohibiting the export of arms and ammunition to Kuwait and Bahrain,284 OMAN (MUSCAT). The great difficulty encountered in restricting the trade at Muscat was the interest which certain French dealers had acquired in it, and French treaties with Oman. Tn 1912 the Sultan, in consideration of an increase of one lakh of rupees in his annual subsidy {cf. pages 276 and 277 above) from the British Government, issued a Proclamation establishing an arms warehouse and setting forth rules and regulations to govern the import and export of these goods. These regulations were intended to prevent tlie issue of aims to all destinations where their import was prohibited, and thereby to kill this illegitimate traffic. In 1913 Saiyid Faisal died and was succeeded by his eldest son the present Sultan Saiyid Taimur. In 1913, a few months before the death of Saiyid Faisal, the tribes of the interior of Oman, who had been dissatisfied for some years with the weakness of the Sultan's rule, broke out into open rebellion. Indian troops were landed for the defence of Matrah and Muscat. In 1915 the tribes attacked the British outpost line and met with a crushing defeat; the Sultan's Government, however, was too weak to regain control of the interior. In 1920 the imposition of a penal tax on exports from the interior induced the Omanis to come to terms with the Sultan's Govern ment through the mediation of the Political Agent. In 1921 the Indian troops were withdrawn, their place being taken by a local corps. In 1921 the Sultan signified his adhesion (No. XIX) to the Interna tional Arms Traffic Convention. In 1923 the Sultan gave an undertaking (IS T o. XX) that he would not exploit petroleum in his territory without consulting the Political Agent and the Government of India. In 1925 the Sultan concluded an agreement with the D'Arcy Ex ploitation Company, giving them a two-years' concession to explore for natural gas, petroleum, asphalt and ozokerite in his territories. The exploration license granted under the agreement was extended for a further period of one year, after the expiration of which the agreement lapsed. The question of the revision of the Treaty of 1891 (No XYI) came under consideration in 1903, and His Majesty's Government approved a revised draft in 1905. The question has, however, since remained in iInn an T The Treaty WaS P rolon £ ed for five years in 1914, and since 11 lias ^ een Prolonged every year up to the present time (No XXI) The Commonwealth of Australia withdrew from participation in the Treaty in 1923.

Thev then attempted to obtain mastery over the town but were attacked by'certain■■■■AHHHHHHIHflnHHHHnnBnHiBiHnnMlb OMAN (MUSCAT)— Sohar. 285 sections of the Jannabah, a local tribe of Sur. Dissensions amongst the Jannabah however enabled the Bani llu Ali to take sides with some of their sections against others and to interfere in the internal administration of Snr. The Political Resident visited Snr in August 1930 and interviewed the Shaikhs of both the tribes with the result that the Jannabah promised to settle their differences and the Bani Bu Ali hauled down their flag and hoisted that of the Sultan. In 1929 the Sultan of Muscat agreed to the erection of a permanent wireless post of the British Government at Muscat. In March 1930 the Shaikh of Ruus-al-Tibal prevented survey parties from H. M. S. Ormonde from landing at Khasab, refused to obey the orders of the Sultan of Muscat on the subject, cut off supplies from the Wali of Khasab and generally adopted an openly rebellious attitude. The Sultan sought the aid of the British Government in subduing the Shaikh, and an ultimatum was issued to the Shaikh calling upon him to surrender. As he refused to do so punitive action was taken against him by IT. M. S. Lupin and Cyclamen in company with the Sultan's gunboat Al Said. After due warning the Shaikh's fort at Khasab was bombarded and the Sultan declared the port closed to dhow traffic. The Shaikh surrendered on the 5th May when he was made a State prisoner, a new Shaikh being appointed in his place. Sohar. The present ruling family of Muscat are, as has been already noted, descended from Ahmad bin Said, the Governor of Sohar, a town on the Batinah coast about 100 miles north-west of Muscat, who in 1741 expelled the Persians and became the first ruler of Muscat. Saiyid Qais of Sohar, who had attempted to supplant his nephew Saiyid Said in the government of Muscat, was killed in 1808, and his family were deprived of their patrimony. In 1830, however, his grandson Saiyid Kamud bin Azzan, the cousin of Saiyid Said, taking advantage of the absence of the latter at Zanzibar, regained possession of Sohar and compelled Saiyid Said to restore to him also other districts on payment of tribute. His popularity in Oman was great and, but for the intervention of the British Govern ment, he would have succeeded in dismembering the Muscat possessions. In 1839 a reconciliation was effected between Saiyid Said and Saiyid Kamud through the mediation of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and an Engagement (No. XXII) was mediated between them by which they engaged to abstain from aggressions on each other, and to admit free intercourse and trade between their respective possessions. Saiyid Said also bound himself to support the Sohar chief when attacked by enemies. By this agreement the Chief of Sohar became independent. As the general engagements for the suppression of the slave trade in the Persian Gulf were concluded while the relations of Sohar and Muscat were still undefined, no formal agreement had been concluded with Saiyid Hamud. (f^c ,.SI286 OMAN (MUSCAT)—Softar. But in 1848 lie was invited to enter into the general arrangements: and a Treaty* (No. XXTIT), similar to those concluded with the other mari time States for the suppression of the slave trade, was concluded in 1849 with his son Saiyid Said, who was then in possession of the govern ment. Saiyid Saif, who had usurped his father's authority, was soon afterwards put to death by him. The treaty concluded in 1889 between Muscat and Sohar contained no article by which the British (xovernment undertook to guarantee its con ditions; but the very formal manner in which it was negotiated was con sidered to make it more than usually binding on both parties. Notwith standing this, Saiyid Thuwaini, who governed Muscat during his father's absence at Zanzibar, treacherously seized Saiyid TTamud at a friendly conference and laid siege to Sohar by land and sea. Failing in his attempts to take the fort, he returned to Muscat, carrying his prisonei with him. Saiyid TTamud died from the rigour of his confinement in 1850. Saiyid Qais, his brother, took up arms to avenge his death, and with the help of the Qawasim took Shinas and several other forts. Saiyid Said, however, returning from Zanzibar, gained over the Qawasim to his side and defeated Saiyid Qais, from whom he took Sohar, leaving to him Rustaq and Hibi and assigning him a monthly stipend of 200 crowns. On the death of Saiyid Said, his son Saiyid Turki, who had been placed in the government of Sohar, made several unsuccessful attempts to make himself independent of his elder brother Saiyid Thuwaini, and to create a rebellion in Oman. Accordingly in 18(12 Saiyid Thuwaini seized him and placed him in confinement. Tie was subsequently released on the intervention of the British Government, and a monthly allowance was made to him by Saiyid Thuwaini conditionally on his remaining loyal. Tn 1805, in consequence of Saiyid Thuwaini's expressed distrust of his brother, he was informed that Saiyid Turki would be permitted to reside in India during good behaviour on any allowance he might sanction : and that, unless Saiyid Turki accepted this offer, the British Government would not interfere between him and his suzerain. When Saiyid Thuwaini was murdered in the following year, Saiyid Turki's life was in danger at Sohar, and he was taken up by the British Resident. The subsequent history of Sohar has been given in the narra tive of Muscat affairs. Being now a part of Muscat dominions, it is governed by a AVali nominated by the Sultan. * An Act of Parliament, 16 and 17 Vict., Cap. XVT, was passed to carry this treaty into effect.

I address Your Highness on the subject of the unhappy differences which have arisen between yourself and Your Highness's brother, the ruler of Zanzibar, and lor the settlement of which Your Highness has engaged to accept the arbitration of the Viceroy and Governor-General of India. Having regard to the friendly relations which have always existed between the Government of Her Majesty the Queen and the Government of Oman and Zanzibar, and desiring to prevent war between kinsmen, I accepted the charge of arbitration between you, and in order to obtain the fullest knowledge of all the points in disjmte, I directed the Government of Bombay to send an Officer to Muscat and Zanzibar to make the necessary enquiries. Brigadier Coghlan was selected for this purpose, an officer in whose judgment, intelligence, and im partiality the Government of India reposes the utmost confidence. Brigadier Coghlan has submitted a full and clear report of all the questions at issue between Your Highness and your brother. I have given my most careful attention to each of these questions. The terms of my decision are as follows :— 1st. —That His Highness Syud Majid be declared ruler of Zanzibar and the African dominions of His late Highness Syud Saeed. 2nd. —That the ruler of Zanzibar pay annually to the ruler of Muscat a subsidy of 40,000 crowns. 3rd. —That His Highness Syud Majid pay to His Highness Syud Thowaynee the arrears of subsidy for two years, or 80,000 crowns. I am satisfied that these terms are just and honourable to both of you : and as you have deliberately and solemnly accepted my arbitration, I shall expect that you will cheerfully and faithfully abide by them, and that they will be carried out without unnecessary delay. The annual payment of 40,000 crowns is not to be understood as a recogni tion of the dependence of Zanzibar upon Muscat, neither is it to be considered as merely personal between Your Highness and your brother Syud Majid. It is to extend to your respective successors, and is to be held to be a final and permanent arrangement, compensating the ruler of Muscat for the abandonment of all claims upon Zanzibar, and adjusting the inequality between the two inheritances derived from your father, His late Highness Syud Saeed, the venerated friend of the British Government, which two inheritances are to be henceforward distinct and separate.

They shall more especially not be liable to other or more onerous duties, im posts, restrictions, or obligation of whatever description, than those to which subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation now are, or hereafter may be, subjected. Article 3. . f ^ le ^ wo Contracting I arties acknowledge reciprocally to each other the right of appointing Consuls to reside in each other's dominions wherever theOMAN (MUSCAT)—NO. XVI—1891. 311 interests of commerce may require the presence of such officers ; and such Consuls shall at all times be placed, in the country in which they reside, on the footing of the Consuls of the most favoured nations. Each, of the High Contracting Parties further agrees to permit his own subjects to be appointed to Consular Offices by the other Contracting Party, provided alwyas that the person so appointed shall not begin to act without the previous approbation of the Sovereign whose subjects they may be.

Article 6. His Highness the Sultan shall be permitted to levy a duty of entry not ex ceeding 5 per cent, on the value of all goods and merchandise, of whatever de scription, imported by sea from foreign countries into His Highness's dominions. This duty shall be paid at that port in His Highness's dominions where the goods are first landed, and, on payment thereof, such goods shall thereafter be exempt, within the Sultan's dominions, from all other custom duties or taxes, levied by, or on behalf of, the Government of His Highness the Sultan, by whatever names these may be designated, and no higher import duty shall be claimed from British subjects than that which is paid by subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation.312 OMAN (MUSCAT)—NO. XVI—1891. This duty, once paid, shall cover, from all other charges on the part of His Highness the Sultan, goods of whatever description coming from Foreign coun tries by sea, whether these are intended for local consumption or for transmis sion elsewhere in bulk or otherwise, and whether they remain in the state in which they are imported or have been manufactured.

But goods and merchandise so landed shall be exempted only, provided that the consignee or his Agent shall have, on the arrival of the ship, handed over the said goods to be kept under Customs seal, and de clared them as landed for transhipment, designating at the same time the foreign port of destination, and also provided that the said goods are actually shipped for the said foreign port as originally declared, within a period not exceeding six months after their first landing, and without having, in the interval, changed owners. (2) All goods and merchandise w'hich, not being consigned to a port within the dominions of the Sultan, have been inadvertently landed, provided that such goods are re-shipped within a month of being so landed and transported abroad. Should, however, such goods or merchandise, here spoken of, be opened or removed from the custody of the Customs authorities, the full duty shall then be payable on the same, (3) Coals, naval provisions, stores, and fittings, the property of Her Majesty's Government, landed in the dominions of His Highness for the use of the ships of Her Majesty's Navy. (4) All goods and merchandise transhipped or landed for the repair of damage caused by stress of weather or other disasters at sea, provided the cargo so discharged shall be re-shipped and taken away on board of the same vessel, or if the latter shall have been condemned, or her departure delayed, in any other manner.

A rticle 9. It shall be at the option of the British subject in each case to pay the per centage duties stipulated in Article 6, either in cash, or, if the nature of the goods allows of it, in kind, by giving up an equivalent amount of the goods or produce. In the event of payment being made in cash, the value of the merchandise, goods, or produce on which duty is to be levied, shall be fixed according to the ready money market price ruling at the time when the duty is levied. In the case of foreign imports, the value shall be fixed according to the market price at Muscat, and in that of native goods and produce by the market price at the place where the merchant shall choose to pay the duty. In the event of any dispute arising between a British subject and the Custom house authorities regarding the value of such goods, this shall be determined by reference to two experts, each party nominating one, and the value so ascertained shall be decisive. Should, however, these experts not be able to agree, they shall choose an umpire, whose decision is to be considered final. A rticle 10. His Highness the Sultan of Muscat engages by the present Treaty to provide and give orders to his officials that the movement of goods in transit shall not be obstructed or delayed in a vexatious manner by unnecessary Customs formali ties and Regulations, and that every facility will be given for their transport.

A rticle 12. Should sailors or others belonging to a British ship of war, or merchant vessel, desert, and take refuge on shore or on board of any of His Highness's ships, the authorities of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat shall, upon request of a Con sular official, or, in his absence, of the Captain of the ship, take the necessary steps in order to have them arrested and delivered over to the Consular official or to the Captain. In this, however, the Consular officer and Captain shall render every assistance. A rticle 13.

The trial and also the punishment of all offences and crimes of which British subjects may be accused within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, also the hearing and settlement of all civil questions, claims, or disputes in which they are the defendants, is expressly reserved to the British Consular authorities and Courts, and removed from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan. Should disputes arise between subjects of His Highness the Sultan or other non-Christian Power, not represented by Consuls at Muscat, and a subject of Her Britannic Majesty, in which the British subject is the plaintiff or complainant, the matter shall be brought before and decided by the highest authority of the Sultan, or some person specially delegated by him for this purpose. The proceed ings and final decision in such a case shall not, however, be considered legal unless notice has been given and an opportunity afforded for the British Consul or his substitute to attend at the hearing and final decision.

BALUCHISTAN— Kalat Agency. 305 KALAT AGENCY. 1. K alat. The nucleus of the Kalat State was formed from the few tracts of irrigated land in the immediate neighhourhood of Kalat. About the 15th Century the Dehwar inhabitants of the tracts, finding themselves unable to withstand the depredations of Pathan and Brahui tribes, in vited a Brahui Chief to rule over and protect them. The dynasty thus formed brought in five tribes of their own kin, still known as the Khan's Ulus, and later formed a loose alliance with other Brahui tribes and tribes of Pathan origin which acquired the language and customs and later the name of Brahui. The first noteworthy Khan of Kalat was Abdulla Khan. At the commencement of the eighteenth century, he affected to be independent of the Delhi empire, and reduced several provinces to his rule. During the reign of his son Mahabat Khan, Nadir Shah invaded India, and annexed the whole of the territories west of the Indus. On the dismemberment of the Persian empire after the death of Nadir Shah, Kalat formed part of the territories over which Ahmad Shah Abdali established his supremacy. Mahabat Khan, who was unpopular with his Chiefs, was deposed by Ahmad Shah, and his younger brother Nasir Khan was appointed to rule in his stead. From this time the power remained with the younger branch of tlie family, till the attempt vvhich the British Government made after the first Afghan War to change the succession. Nasir Khan I (the Great) was by far the most distinguished of the Khans of Kalat. It was he who devised the peculiar polity the main principles of which still govern the relations between the Khan and the tribal chiefs of Sarawan and Jhalawan. His policy was to attach more completely to his interests the nomad Brahui tribes of the highlands and to weld them into a weapon sufficiently strong to enable him to assert a virtual independence of Delhi. The means were at hand in the recently acquired province of Kachhi, which had been granted to his predecessor Mahabat Khan in lieu of blood money for Abdullah Khan, who was murdered by a Rind when fleeing wounded after an encounter with the Kalhora. Nasir Khan granted the chiefs of the Brahui nomad tribes fiefs in the rich plain of Kachhi, on condition that they supplied him with a certain quota of men at arms. By the acquisition of Kachhi he also acquired control over certain Baluch tribes of the plains, and a less firm control over the Marri and Bugti. With the aid of these tribal con tingents he extended his authority to the south-west over Makran.326 B A L l J CH J ST A N— Kalat A(j ency. Nasir Khan was succeeded in 1795 by his son Mahmud Khan, and he in 1819 by his son Mehrab Khan, in whose time the political connec tion of the British Government with Kalat began. Mehrab Khan was a well-meaning but weak ruler. He disgusted his Chiefs by surrendering himself to the influence of one Daud Muhammad, a man of low extraction, for whom he sacrificed the hereditary minister, i ateh Muhammad. Daud Muhammad, however, was killed by Fateli Muhammad s sou, Naib Mulla Muhammad Hasan, who was restored to the hereditary office; but he never forgave the injury done to his father, and the misfortunes which subsequently overlook Mehrab Khan were due to his revenge. On the failure of Shah Shuja's first attempt to recover his dominions in 18-33, he found refuge for a short time at Kalat before his return to his exile at Ludhiana, When the expedition of 1838 for the restoration of Shall Shuja was determined on, a British officer. Lieutenant Leech, was sent to Kalat to secure the co-operation of Mehrab Khan, through whose territories the armies had to march. Mulla Muhammad Hasan, however, contrived to create enmity between the Khan and Lieutenant Leech, who left without attaining his object. The treacherous minister further caused it to be believed that the Khan had seized stores of grain which had been collected for the British troops, and wrote orders in the Khan s name, but without his knowledge, inciting the tribes to rise and harass the British army on its line of march. Sir Alexander Burnes was deputed to Kalat to allay the supposed hostility of the Khan and to negotiate a Treaty (No. I) with him. The treatv was signed contrary to the secret wishes of Mulla Muhammad Hasan, and the Khan agreed o proceed to Quetta to pay his respects to Shah Shuja. Sir A. Burnes preceded him; but on his way Mullah Muhammad Hasan caused him to be robbed of the draft treaty which the Khan had signed. The belief that this was done at the instigation of the Khan was studiously impressed on the British Government, and the Khan himself was prevented from gonig to Quetta by MuUa Muhammad Hasan, who frightened him into . le , 1 )e ^ ^ ^ e British intended to make him a prisoner. The proofs o the Khan s hostility were now apparently complete, and it was resolved to punish him when a fitting opportunity occurred. Accordingly, when General Wiltshire's brigade was returning from Kabul m 1839, a detachment was sent to Kalat to punish the Khan. he town was taken on the 13th of November, Mehmb Khan fell in the assaul , and his son Husain Khan fled. From the papers discovered in the fort the treachery of Mulla Muhammad Hasan was fully proved, and he was made a prisoner.

Shuli Nawaz Jvlian was set up by the British Lruvernment as Khan of Kaiat, but the provinces oi Sarawan and KacL Gandawa were annexed to the dominions of the ruler of Xabul. ShoitJj aftei the accession of Shah Nawaz Xhan 3 a revolution broke out, headed Mehrab Khan s son Husain Khan, who had assumed the name of Nasir Khan. Shah jNawaz Khan was deposed, the British repre sentative at Kalat was murdered, and there was open war between Nasir Khan and the British Government. As the only means of quieting' the country and doing tardy justice to the memory of the unfortunate Mehrab Khan, the British Government reversed its policy, established Nasir Khan in power, and restored to him the districts which had been annexed to Kabul. A Treaty (No. 11) was concluded with him in 1841, the main feature of which was that it recognised Kalat as a dependency of Kabul. After the withdrawal of the British army from Kabul, this Treaty became a dead letter. In 1842 a proposal was made to conclude a supplementaly tieaty, by which pecuniary aid should be substituted for military support to the Khan ; but this suggestion was not acted upon. In 1854, however, when war between England and Russia was threatened, and it became of importance to strengthen British influence on the western frontier, a new Treaty (No. Ill) was concluded with the Khan. This abrogated the Ireaty of 1841, and renewed the obligations of the Khan to oppose all enemies of the British Government, to act in subordination to the British Government, to enter into no negotiations with other states without their consent, and to receive British troops into his countrv if such a measure should be deemed necessary; while the British Govern ment granted the Khan an annual subsidy of Us. 50,000 on condition that he prevented his subjects from committing outrages within or near British territory, protected merchants, and permitted no exactions on trade beyond certain specified duties. Nasir Khan died in 185 his death being generally believed to have been caused by poison. There were three claimants for the succession, Azim Khan, brother of Mehrab Khan, his son of the same name, and Khudadad Khan, his half-brother. Khudadad Khan was selected by the ( hiefs of the country, but soon quarrelled with them. He also had to contend against the pretensions of Fateh Khan, brother of the British nominee Shah Nawaz Khan, who was supported by Azad Khan of Kharan. But for the countenance and support of the British Government Khudadad Khan could not have maintained himself in power. In 1859 the British Government gave him lis. 50,000 in addition to the subsidy paid under the Treaty, to enable him to strengthen his hands and meet the cost of reducing the rebellious Marri tribe, who had harassed the British frontier. This additional grant was paid for four successive years, but little good resulted from it. The leading Chiefs of Kalat conspired against Khudadad Khan, and in March 1863 proclaimed hisijll ^ Hi i i »^28 BALUCfTlSTAN—TvaM Agency. cousin Sherdil Klian as their ruler. The town and the fort of Kalat were surrendered to the rebels without a show of defence, and Khudadad Khan retired to Nasirabad in Kachhi. Sherdil Khan was murdered by his own guards in May 1864, and Khudadad Khan was re-elected Chief of the State, He was recognised by the British Government as Khan of Kalat, and the payment of the subsidy of lis. 50,000 under the Treaty of 1854, which had been suspended during the disturbances in the country, was renewed. In 1862 the Khan of Kalat signed an Agreement (No. VI) by which the boundary between Sind and Kalat was defined. A portion of this boundary, on the border of the Shikarpur district, was for some years disputed, but was finally settled in 1887 by an order of the Government of India. In 1807 the Ruler of Kalat was granted a permanent salute of 19 guns. The Telegraph Agreements made, directly or indirectly, with the Khan of Kalat in 1861 (No. IV), 1862 (No. V), 1863 (No. VII), 1869 (No. VIII) and 1870 (No. XI), as well as those made with certain Chiefs of Persian Baluchistan in 1869 (Nos. IX and X), are mentioned under a later heading {Makran Telegrayh Line, q. v.). The history of Kalat after the restoration of Khudadad Khan was marked by constant conflicts between the Khan and his turbulent subjects. Taj Muhammad Khan, the Chief of the Jhalawan country, was taken prisoner and placed in confinement, where he soon afterwards died : and the Jam of Las Bela was forced to take refuge in British territory. But in 1871 a combination of the Brahui Chiefs ended in open rebellion. The causes of their discontent were alleged to be the resumption by the Khan of their hereditary lands and the introduction of changes which deprived them of their due share in the administration. Finding himself unable to coerce his subjects, the Khan asked for British aid and dele gated to the Commissioner in Sind full powers to mediate a settlement. The malcontents were summoned to Jacobabad, and an arrangement was effected by which the Khan consented to restore to the Sardars their confiscated lands; to grant them the allowances customary in the time of Nasir Khan II; and to allow them to live on their estates so long as they paid him proper allegiance. They, on the other hand, were to restore all property plundered during their rebellion, the Khan consent ing to forego all claims in regard to his own property. The opportunity was taken to impress upon the Sardars the duty of obedience to the legitimate authority of the Khan, and to warn the Khan that high handed interference with the rights of his subjects would not be countenanced. These arrangements, however, were distasteful to the Khan, who resented the part taken in promoting them by his minister the ShahgasiB aluchistan— Kuiat Agency. 329 VV ali Muhammad Ivlian. He then came under the influence of unworthy favourites, and quarrelled with ^Vali Muhammad: and it was not until the 1 olitical Agent, whose appointment had been revived after remaining in abeyance since 18G4, was on the point of leaving Kalat, that he con sented to restore the minister to his former position and dismiss the favouiites. hinding his efforts to procure the recall of these men un availing, the Khan ceased to look after his administration, and took no steps to remedy the disorder which prevailed in Las Bela, or to compen sate merchants for the plunder of their caravans. This led to the depar ture of the Political Agent, accompanied by Wali Muhammad, from Kalat territory in 187-}, and to the withholding of the payment of the annual subsidy under the terms of the Treaty of 1854, The Khan was also informed that his obligations under the Treaty to protect trade and secure the peace of the frontier remained unaltered; but that, in the event of disturbances occurring on the frontier, the British Government would be compelled to take their own measures for preserving order. During the rebellion against the Khan the attitude of the Marri and 13ugti was uncertain; at its close an attack, said to have been instigated by the Khan, was made by the Brahui on the section of the Marri to which the protection of the Bolan Pass had been entrusted. The Marri retaliated by plundering caravans, and a state of chronic disorder ensued. In these circumstances the Khan was informed that, until he showed both willingness and ability to put an end to plundering and outrages near the British frontier, the Government of India would take their own measures to protect their territories and subjects. Subjects of Kalat committing offences in British territory, if apprehended there, would receive the utmost penalty of the law ; and, if they succeeded in escaping into Kalat, they would be followed and punished. At length the state of anarchy prevailing on the frontier became so intolerable that the Government of India decided to depute a special agent to effect, if possible, some settlement between the Khan and his Sardars. Captain Sandemau, the officer selected for this duty, convinced himself, during his first mission in 1875, that a modus vivendi could be arranged between the contending parties through the mediation of the British Government. 1 he result of his labours was considered so far satisfactory that in the spring of the following year he was again deputed to Baluchistan; and at a Darbar held at Mastung in -luly 1876 lie effected a formal reconci liation between the Khan and the leading Brahui Chiefs, the Baluch Chiefs being absent. Tn December of the same year the Khan met the Viceroy at -Tacobabnd, and a new Treaty (No. XII) was concluded on the 8th of that month. It re-affirmed the engagements made in 1854; and provided, among other things, for the location of troops in, and the construction of railway and telegraph hues through, Kalat territory; political officers, with suitable330 BALUCHI ST A N— Kalat Agency. escorts, were to be posted in the Kliun's dominions; and the British UovermJient undertook to pay the Khan au annual subsidy of one lakh of rupees, which was to be supplemented by a contribution of Us. 20,501) a year for the development of traffic on the trade routes running through his country. This treaty was the foundation of the Baluchistan Agency. On the 21st February 18T7 Major Sandeman was appointed Agent to the Governor-General, his headquarters were fixed at Quetta and British troops were cantoned at Quetta and Mitri. During the Afghan War Khudadad Khan loyally acted up to his engagements, and proved his willingness to assist the British Government by all means in his power. In 1880 the Khan made over to the British Government 'with full jurisdiction (No. X [11) the lands on which the Kandahar State Railway had been constructed. In 1879 it had been arranged that the district immediately surround ing Quetta should he administered by British officers, any surplus revenue being made over to the Khan. In 1888 a fresh Agreement (N3 XIV) was entered info, by which Khudadad Khan agreed to lease tlie Quetta Niabat to the British Government for an annual rent of Ivs. 20 ,000: and at the same time, in consideration of a yearly payment of lis. 30,000, he surrendered his right to collect tolls on the trade passing through the Bolan Pass. In 1893 certain murders were committed at Bhag in Kalat territory, for which Khudadad Khan was found to be responsible.. The Khan himself asked the Government of India to accept his resignation and to recognise Mahmud Khan as his successor. The Government of India, while holding that Khudadad Khan's conduct would justify his deposi tion, decided, in consideration of the fact that lie had been an ally of the British Government for many years, and in deference to his position and rank, to accept his abdication. Khudadad Khan accordingly abdicated in 189.} in favour of his eldest son the present Khan Mahmud Khan, born in 1804. He was installed by the Agent to the Governor-General on the 10th November 1893. He enjoys a personal salute of 21 guns. In 1894 the Khan of Kalat ceded (No. XX) full jurisdiction over the lands required for the Mushkaf-Bolan Railway. 1 he frontier between Kalat and Persia from the sea to Kuhak had been settled, but not demarcated, by an Anglo-Persian Commission in 872. In 1896 a joint British and Persian Commission, which had been appointed to decide upon and demarcate the Perso-Baluch boundary from Kuhak to Koh-i-Malik Siah, surveyed and demarcated (No. XXII) part of the boundary northward from Kuhak. 11 boundary pillars wereBALUCHISTAN— Kalat Agency. 33j ! | set up; but the Persian Government failed to send a surveyor to work with tlie British surveyor, and the boundary north of pillar No. 11 was not actually marked out on the ground, but was merely described and marked on the existing maps, which were subsequently found to be inaccurate. Some tension afterwards resulted, particularly regarding the possession of Mirjawa: and it was decided that the undemarcated boundary should be marked out by a joint Anglo-Persian Commission, Later, it was decided to dispense with any actual delimitation, provided that a suitable arrangement could be concluded with the Persian Govern ment: and in May 1905 an Anglo-Persian Agreement (No. XXX) was signed, under which Great Britain withdrew the claim to Mirjawa, while the Persian Government undertook to permit the British post at Padaha to procure water from the Mirjawa side, and due provision was made for supplies for the neighbouring British posts. In consideration of this settlement, the two Governments agreed to abandon the further examination of the boundary by a joint commission. In 1899 the Khan transferred the Nushki district and Niabat in perpetuity to the Government of India in consideration of an annual quit-rent of Rs. 9.000 (No. XXVI); and in 1903 he similarly transferred the Niabat of Nasirabad, including the Manjuti lands, for a quit-rent of Rs. 1,17,500 (No. XXVIII). Full jurisdiction over the lands required for the Nushki Railway was ceded (No. XXIX) by the Khan in 1903. The administration of Kalat proper, or the Khan of Kalat's Niabats, is now in the hands of a Wazir-i-Azam, whose services are placed at the disposal of the Khan by the Government of India, and the Khan enjoys a civil list of Rs. 3,50,000 per annum. The administration of the tribal area has passed into the hands of the Political Agent; but every endeav our is made to encourage the Sardars to manage their own tribes. In 1917 the Khan agreed to the regularization of the finances of the State. An Audit Office was established, and all revenue is paid into the State Treasury: payments can only be made in accordance with the sanctioned budget which, after being sanctioned by the Khan, \s approved by the Agent to the Governor-General, wtio appoints the Audit Officer and his staff. In 1927 the Khan issued a decree abolishing slavery throughout his dominions. According to estimates made in 1921 the area of Kalat, including Kharan and Makran, is 73,278 square miles, and the population 328,281. The revenue has in recent years amounted to between 16 and 17 lakhs of rupees, inclusive of the payments made to the Khan by the Govern ment of India. The military forces of Kalat consist (1926) of 154 Cavalry, 68 Infantry and 20 Artillery men, with 12 serviceable and 23 unserviceable guns.332 BALUCHISTAN— Agency. 2. M akran. British Makran, the South Western Province of Kalat State, is divid ed into two districts, Panjgur which consists of the valleys of the Gichk and Ilakhshan Rivers, and Kech which consists of the vallevs of the Kech aud Nihing Rivers, Kolwa and the coastal tract. The Grichkis, the ruling family in British Makran, are reputed to he of Rajput origin. They originally settled in the Gichk valley and from that base gained control of the whole of Panjgur. Early in the eighteenth century a younger branch succeeded in ousting the Buledas, who then ruled over Kech, and established themselves there. About 1750 Nasir Khan I, after more than one expedition to Makran, extracted from both families of Gichkis an agreement whereby he under took to protect them from external aggression and internal dissension in return for half the land revenue of the country. The Gichkis shook off the Kalat yoke in the time of Mahmud Khan, but his successor Mehrab Khan re-established his rule over them. The Khan of Kalat frequently selected a Gichki as his Naib in Kech and Panjgur, but occasionally sent a Naib from a Brahui Sardarkhel; for instance Faqir Muhammad, Bizanjo, who maintained peace in Kech for over 30 years. During this time Panjgur was ravaged by inter necine strife between Mirs Gajian and Isa, claimants to the Sardari of Panjgur, whom the Khan favoured in turn. At the signing of the Treaty of 18T6 (No. XII) at Jacobabad, Lord Lytton promised the Khan that Colonel Sandeman should proceed to Makian 1o setlle the country. 1 he Second Afghan AVar, however, intervened, and Colonel Sandeman was not able to visit Makran till 1884, lu wLich time haqir Muhammad was dead^ and Kech was in as disturbed a state as Panjgur. 1 he Government of India then decided to undertake onlv the mini mum of commitments in Makran. In 1896 the services of a Hindu official A\eie lent to the Khan as Nazim of Makran. The Khan himself ^ent to Makian to instal the Nazim, but within two years the country had risen. The rising, which was headed by Mir Mehrab Khan, half- brother of Sardar Sheh Fmar, son of Sardar Mir Baian of Kech, needed a column of all arms for its suppression. The rebels were defeated at Gokhprosht, and Mehrab Khan fled across the border. Sardar Sheh Umar and his cousin Abdul Karim, Naib of Kech, remained loyal to the British Government. The Government of India then decided that a new Nazim should he e ec '^ e d) who should not take a direct hand in the collection of revenue,BEBMH BALUCHISTAN— Kalat Agency. 333 but should see thai; the Naibs did their duty, and should keep the Khan informed of what went on in the country. The Local Administration Avas at the same time enjoined not to interfere in the details of the administration of Makran. The possibility of adhering to these prohibitions was in any case doubtful; but the choice of the new Nazim made such a course impossible. Mir Mehrullah Khan, uncle of the Eaisani Sardar, was the man selected. Described as the strongest man in Baluchistan, he had recently headed a demonstration against the British Government in Sarawan, and was at the head of a faction of Sardars who claimed to be independent of the Khan. He soon created an autocracy entirely independent of the Khan except for financial support: an autocracy in which the rightful Sardar Shell TJmar was pushed on one side in favour of his disloyal half-brother Mir Mehrab Khan, who had headed the recent rising'. In 1904 the Makran Levy Corps was raised, and an Assistant Political Agent, who was ex-ojficio Commandant of the Corps, was stationed in Panjgur. His duties were confined to frontier affairs and the control of the Corps, and the Nazim continued to rule Makran nominally on behalf of the Khan. In 1917 Mir Mehrullah Khan retired ami the post of Nazim was held by Indian Officials lent to the Kalat State until 1922, when the Khan of Kalat's brother Nawab Bahadur Mir Azam Jan was sent to rule the country on behalf of the Khan. This experiment proving unsuccess ful, a Naib Wazir was appointed to take charge of Makran under the Wazir-i-Azam. The peculiar status of the Gichkis was provided for by placing them under the Assistant Political Agent who is also in control of the frontier. The area of Makran is estimated at 23,269 square miles. The popu lation, according to the Census of 1921, is 71,860: and the revenue, in 1926-27, showed a surplus of Ps. 75,79 .1. Ferso-Kalat Frontier. —The construction of the Indo-European Tele graph Line necessitated the defining of relationships with the petty Chiefs who then dominated the country to the west of Kech. Dissensions among these Chiefs and their raids on Persian territory afforded Persia opportunities, which she was not slow to seize, of extending her frontier to the eastward until she had not only exacted tribute from the whole of Makran west of Kech, except a portion of the sea coast about Chahbar and Gwadar, but had asserted claims of sovereignty over Kech and its dependencies, which were under the authority of the Khan of Kalat. The British Government, having treaty relations with Kalat, could not view with indifference the threats of aggression which were constantly held over the Khan's subjects in Kech, and the expediency of putting a stop to these proceedings on the part of the Persian frontier authoritiesB A L U OH 1ST A N— Kalat Aye. n cy. was impressed on the minister of the Shah. A proposal was then made by the Shah that the boundaries between Persia and Kalat should be defined by Commissioners on the part of England, Persia and Kalat. To this the British Government assented, and the frontier from the sea at (jwattur Hay &lt;0 Kuhak was settled, but not demarcated, by a Frontier Com mission whose award was accepted by the Shah in 1871. According to this Panjgur and Parom and their dependencies, with Kuhak, Boleda, including Zamiran, and their dependencies, Maud, including Tump, Nasirabad, Kech and all districts, delis, and dependencies to the east ward, and Dasht witli its dependencies as far as the sea, were declared to be beyond the Persian frontier. Claims were afterwards put forward by Persia to the small district of Kuhak below the frontier districts of Talk and Kalagan on the Persian side. Without pronouncing any opinion as to whether Kuhak was Per sian territory or not, the British Government agreed that the boundary line of Kalat should be drawn to the east of Kuhak. Kuhak was occupied by the Persians in May 1874, and was formally included in Persia in 1896 by the Perso-Baluch Boundary Commission Agreement (No. XXII). In 1902 a joint Jirga of Sardars of British and Persian Baluchistan agreed to adopt* certain measures for the periodical settlement of border cases. Among other provisions it was agreed that there should be an annual meeting on the border between the Nazim and the Deputy Governor of Bampur. At the same time the Governor-General of Kerman undertookt to do all in his power to check the traffic in arms through Persian Baluchistan. As the result of the entente thus established the Political Agent, with tn escort consisting of eight British officers and 500 men of all arms, accompanied the Persian Governor on a march through Persian Balu chistan and assisted in destroying several forts which had afforded isvlum to raiders. Persian control of the province of Persian Baluchistan ceased in 1908, and the Governorship of Bampur was usurped by an adventurer, Mir Bahram Khan, Baranzai. The frontier entente came to an end and raids into British Makran became frequent. In 1915 Mir Bahram Khan invaded British territory with 1,400 men and 2 guns which he had taken from the Persians. His force was re pulsed from Maud Post by its garrison of 36 men of the Makran Levy Corps, though the post was several times set on fire by bursting shells. * Roe Appendix No. TTT. t See Appendix No. IV.BALUCHISTAN— Kalat Agency. 335 Makran 7 elegraph Line. —Since 1861 various agreements liave been entered into, from time to time, with some of the Chiefs, in connection with the construction and protection of the Makran telegraph line. The erst to be made was with the Jam of Las Bela in December 1861 (No. IV), whereby he was granted a subsidy of Es. 10,000 a year for the protection of the portion of the line passing through his territory. In January 1802 a similar Agreement (No. V) was made with Mir Fakir Muhammad, at that time the Khan of Kalat's Naib in Kech, for the protection oi the line from Kalrnat to Gwadar. These agreements were made with the knowledge and consent of the Khan of Kalat, and were approved by the Government of India in August 1862. At the same time it was proposed that an agreement should be made with the Khan of Kalat setting forth that, in consideration of the sum of lis. 16,000 being annually paid into the hands of the Political Agent at Kalat, to be disbursed by him to the Jam of Las Bela (Es. 10,000) and to the Naib of Kech (Es. 6,000) for the protection of the line of telegraph, the Khan would undertake to do all in his power to maintain the line. Subsequently an Agreement (No. VII) dated the 20th February 1863 was concluded with the Khan, whereby, in return for an annual subsidy of Es. 5,000, he undertook the protection of the line between the western boundary of the province under the rule of the Jam of Las Bela and the eastern boundary of the Gwadar territory. Under article 6 of the agreement the Khan was to suggest in what proportions he wished the Political Agent to distribute the sum to the various Chiefs to whom he would entrust the conservation of the line. In May 1863, however, it was ordered that, as Kalat was in the hands of the revolted Baluchis the engagement should be considered in abeyance. In the same month the Government of India sanctioned the increase of the Jam's subsidy to Es. 15,000. In December 1863 it was decided that the Naib of Kech's subsidy under the agreement of January 1862 should be fixed at Es. 5,000 a year, and that Es. 1,000 a year should be granted to Bahrain Khan of Pasni for the protection of the line through Pasni. In 1869, in continuation of the Agreement of 1862, another was made with the Naib of Kech (No. VIII), whereby, in return for a subsidy of Es. 1,500 a year, he undertook on behalf of himself and Mir Bhaian, Gichki, the protection of the line from Gwadar to the Bahu boundary. The cost of the line riders was to be deducted from the subsidy by the telegraph superin tend en t. In the same year Jam Mir Khan, then ruler of Las Bela, rebelled against the Khan and was defeated; his country lapsed to the Kban and the subsidy of Es. 15,000, as well as the conditions for the protection of the 1 ine, were also transferred to him. In August 1870, owing to the XI 2 A330 BALUCHISTAN— Kalat Agency. difficulty experienced in protecting the line from Kalat, the Klian agreed (No. XI) to pay Rs. 6,600 a year to the Telegraph Department to arrange for guards, etc. He also consented to allow the e^-.Tam of Las Bela Rs. 8,000 a year so long as the latter remained under British protection. The balance of Rs. 400 out of the subsidy of Rs. 15,000 was retained by the Khan. This arrangement took effect from the 1st January 1870. Subsequently, in 1877, Mir Khan was allowed to return to Las Bela, and it was decided in November of that year to revert to the terms of the agreement of 1861, and to pay the whole amount of Rs. 15,000 to the Jam direct. In 1881 an annual subsidy of Rs. 480 was granted to Mir Mandu, the Chief of Chahbar in Kolwa, but no agreement was taken from him. Before that time the Jam of Las Bela appears to have paid this amount to the Chief out of his own subsidy, for the protection of the line near Ormara. On Mir Mandu's death in 188-3 it was continued to his son, Mir \ ar Muhammad. The subsidy is now paid to Mir Dur Muhammad Bizanjo of Chahbar (Rs. 320) and Sardar Siddiq of Chahbar (Rs. 160). In July 1891 it was decided to pay the Kech subsidies through the administrative officer of Kech-Makran. After Fakir Muhammad's death the sums had been ecjually divided between Sardar Bhai Khan and Shahdad, less Rs. 1,980, which had been paid by the Telegraph Depart ment to the line guards. In 1895 a similar arrangement was made whereby the Pasni and Chahbar subsidies were to be disbursed to the Chiefs tinough the Political Agent, Southern Baluchistan. This system having proved unsuccessful, it was decided in June 1899 to revert to the method by which the Kech, Pasni and Chahbar subsidies were paid dhect 1o ilie Chiefs by Ihe Persian Gulf Telegraph Department. At that time the Kech subsidy was shared by Sardar Shell Umar, Gichki, and Mir Abdul Karim, Gichki, Naib of Kech; but it was then decided to re-distribute the amount and to pay Rs. 2,260 to Mir Mehrab Khan, Gichki, and Rs. 1,130 each to Mir Abdul Karim, Gichki, and Mir Shah Kasim Khan, Gichki. In June 1899 an Agreement (No. XXY) was entered into with Mir Mahmud Khan, Kalmati, of Pasni for the protection of the telegraph line in Pasni on conditions similar to those which had been made with his father Bahrain Khan. A sum of Rs. 520 is at present paid on this account to Mir Bijar Motabir of Kalmat, Pasni. A new line of the Indo-European Telegraph Department was com- p eted from Karachi to Nok-Kundi in 1907. Por its protection, in addi tion to the amounts shown in the statement below, a sum of Rs. 800 a year is distributed to the tribal Chiefs in the form of Khillats; but no agreements were entered into.n'jk. j'f |M ' i .

L as B ela. The State of Las Bela lies on the southern coast of Baluchistan. It is bounded on the north by the Jhalawan division of Kalat, on the south by the Arabian Sea, on the east by the Kirthar range which separates it from Sind, and on the west by the Hala offshoot of the Pab range. Its early history is wrapped in obscurity, but the army of Alexander the Great appears to have marched through the southern part of the State in 325 B. C. In the seventh century its ruler seems to have been a Buddhist priest but later Buddhism gave place to Islam. Little is known about the succeeding period, but Chiefs of the Gujar, Ilunjha, Gunga and Burfat tribes, which are still to be found in Las Bela, are said to have exercised a semi-independent sway previous to the rise of the Aliani family of the Jamot tribe of Kureshi Arabs, to which the present ruling Chief, known as the Jam, belongs. The first Chief of the line, AH Khan I, surnamed Kathuria, estab lished himself about 1742, and was succeeded by Ghulam Shah about 1765. He was succeeded in 177G by Mir Khan I, and he by Ali Khan II in 1818. The Jams appear to have held the province on some kind of tenure from the Khans of Kalat, the original conditionn of which were that the Jam should acknowledge the supremacy of the Khan and maintain a body of troops for service when required.340 BALUCHISTAN— Kalat Agency. The Jam still acknowledges the Klian of Kalat as liis suzerain: and the Jam of the day (Mir Khan II) signed the Mastnng Convention as a Kalat Sardar and voted in the Jirga which recommended the deposition of Khan Khndadad Khan. Mir Khan II, who succeeded Ali Khan II about 1830, several time,^ endeavoured to throw off allegiance to Kalat and make himself indepen dent. The last occasion was in 1868, when the Jhalawan Brahuis, with his connivance, laid waste the Khan of Kalat's territories. On this occasion he appropriated the revenues of two State villages, and threatened to renew hostilities with the Khan. The latter took the ini tiative and sent a force against the Jam, who sought refuge in British territory. At the instance of the British Government the Khan allowed him an income of Rs. 8,000 a year, on condition that he remained within the British borders and abstained from intriguing in the affairs of Kalat. This allowance the Jam declined to receive. lie lived for a time at Karachi, but as he still continued to foment rebellion in Kalat and to hold treasonable correspondence with the subjects of the Khan, he was deported to Hyderabad (Sind), and thence to Poona. In 1874 his son, Ali Khan, escaped from Hyderabad, where he was under surveillance, and returned to Bela, which he ruled for the next three years. In 1877 Mir Khan II was pardoned and restored to his former position. After Isis restoration he quarrelled with his son Ali Khan, who was deported from Bela and detained under surveillance at Sibi till his father's death. Mir Khan II died in January 1888. The succession was disputed; but eventually Ali Khan was acknowledged and installed in January 1889, on certain conditions (No. XVIII). Ali Khan III died in January 1896 and was succeeded by his eldest son Kamal Khan, who .was formally installed ii] May of the same year, Kamal Khan on his accession sub scribed to certain conditions (Ko. XXIII), the most important of which was the stipulation that, for five years at least after his accession, he would delegate all powers of administration to the ^\ T azir selected bv the (rovernment of India. In 1901 these conditions were modified (No. XX\ 11); but the Jam was still required to employ a Wazir approved by the Agent to the Governor-General, and to act in accordance with his advice. Kamal Khan was permitted to resign in 1921 owing to a quarrel with the Mengals caused by his divorcing his Mengal wife. He was succeeded by his eldest son the present Jam Ghulam Muhammad, on whose behalf the State was at first managed by a Wazir. In 1925 he was invested with extended powers on signing an Agreement (No. XXXII) re-affirming the undertaking s given by his predecessors. Ihe aiea of Las Bela is 7,132 square miles; the population, according to the Census of 1921, 50,696 ; and the average revenue lis. 4,03,000. The armed forces of the State consist of about 130 men.BALUCHISTAN— Kalat Agency. 341 Tlie Indo-European telegraph line runs tlirougli the State* and the flam receives lis. 1G,200 per annum for its protection. 4. K har an. The Sardar of Kharan is entitled to the third seat in Darbar in the Sarawan line. Little is known of the history of Kharan previous to the end of the seventeenth century, except that it appears to have formed part of the Persian province of Kerman. The Nusherwani Chiefs, on whom local interest centres, claim descent from the Kianian Maliks, and have at different times acknowledged subordination to 1'ersia, Kalat and Afghanistan. There is evidence that in the time of Nadir Shah Kharan was still included in Kerman; but Nasir Khan I appears to have brought it under the control of Kalat, under which it remained until quarrels between Khudadad Khan and Azad Khan, in the middle of the nineteenth century, threw Azad Khan into the arms of Afghanistan. In 1884 the Agent to the Governor-General visited Kharan and succeeded in settling the chief points of difference between Azad Khan and Khudadad Khan; and Azad Khan acknowledged allegiance to the Khan of Kalat by taking his place among the Sarawan Sardars at a Darbar held at Panjgur. In 1.885 a Settlement (No. XVI) was made with Sardar Azad Khan, by which he undertook to do certain tribal service in consideration of an annual payment of lis. 6,000. Azad Khan died in 1885, and was suc ceeded by his son Nauroz Khan. The settlement of 1885, which had been made with Azad Khan, was continued with Nauroz Khan. He died in 1909 and was succeeded by his son, Muhammad Yakub Khan, who was murdered on the 19th April 1911 by his own sepoys, at the instigation of his relative Amir Khan. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the present Sardar Habibullah Khan, who received the title of Sardar Bahadur in 1919 and of Nawab in 1921. In 1909 Muhammad Yakub Khan had made an Agreement (No. XXXI) with the Government of India : and this was continued on tke 19th September 1911 with Sardar Bahadur Nawab Habibullah Khan. The Kharan Sardar holds from the Khan of Kalat a Jagir at Kluula- badan in Panjgur. The area of Kharan is 18,565 square miles; and the population, according to the Census of 1921, 27,738. The greater part of Kharan is desert. The Indo-European Telegraph line runs through Kharan from Grawag to Ladgasht, and the Sardar receives lis. 4,000 per annum for its protection. 5.

Darwaza m tlie hills where it opens into the Dasht plain. iJie leopening to trade of this 1'ass, which had been closed in the civil wars between the Khan of Kalat and his tribes, was one of the main objects of Colonel Sandeman's first visit to Ivalat. The right to levy tolls passing within this area was handed over to the British Government by the Agreement of 1883 (No. XIA ) in return tor a yearly payment of lis. J}0,0()0 to the Khan and fixed annual pay ments to certain Sardars for service in the I'ass, representing their share of the transit and escort dues. In order to facilitate the collection of tolls, full civil and criminal jurisdiction and all other powers of admin istration in the area, including certain lands purchased at llindli, were ceded by the Khan at the same time. Similar jurisdiction, with the right of occupation, was ceded in 1894 (No. XX) for all railway lands in the Pass. The collection of tolls was abolished in 1884. With the establishment of settled administration, a revival of agri culture in the few cultivable areas in the 1'ass was brought about. Ihe revenue administration of these areas was carried out by the British Government under the Agreement of 1883, and the revenues collected were paid into the British treasury. Subsequent exploitation of minerals, however, raised the question of the right of the State to all forms of revenue accruing from the Pass: and an examination of the existing treaties showed that all such revenues vested in the Kalat State. Against these revenues the British Government had a reasonable claim for the cost of the administration which effected collection; but this claim was waived, as was the State's claim to past revenues : and the position under the existing treaties was affirmed. Thus the revenues accruing in the Bolan Pass are collected by the British Government and paid in full to the Kulat State at the end of each financial year.BAL U Cli ISTAN— Sibi Ay envy. 343 SIBI AGENCY.

The northern part belongs to the Harris and the southern to the Bugtis. They are the strongest Baluch tribes in the Province. The three important clans of the Marris are the Gazni, Loharani-Shirani and Bijrani. The Bugtis include the Pairo- zani Nothani, Durragh Nothani, Khalpar, Massori, Mondrani, Shambani and liaheja. The Chiefs levy no revenue, but usually receive a sheep or a goat from each flock when visiting different parts of their country. The early history of both tribes is obscure. The Marris are known to have driven out the Kupchanis and Hasnis, while the Bugtis conquered the Buledis. Owing to the poverty of their country both tribes were continuously engaged in plunder, and carried their predatory expeditions far into the adjoining localities. They came into contact with the British during the first Afghan War, when a small detachment was sent to occupy Kalian and guard the flank of the lines of communication with Afghanis tan; but it was invested for five months and two attempts at relief were beaten off. The fort was, however, only surrendered after a safe retreat had been secured from Doda Khan, the Marri Chief. In 1845 Sir Charles Napier conducted a campaign against the Bugtis, who fled to the Khet- rans, and the expedition was only a qualified success. Sir John Jacob, after much trouble with both tribes, but especially with the Bugtis, settled some of the latter on irrigated lands in Sind in 1847, but many of them shortly afterwards fled back to their native hills. Both tribes were subsi dised by the Khan of Kalat after the Treaty of 1854, but in 1859 Khuda- dad Khan was obliged to make an expedition against the Marris. Another unsuccessful campaign followed in 1862, and systematic raids continued. Previous to 1867 the Punjab authorities had attempted to control the Bugtis by enlisting into their service some of the subordinate Chiefs with their clansmen, giving them land rent free, and places in the border militia. This policy, however, proved unsuccessful, partly owing to jealousies among the remaining Chiefs who had not been dealt with similarly, and partly to the different policy pursued by the Sind Govern ment towards the sections of these tribes on its own frontier. In 1867, therefore. Captain Sandeman endeavoured to extend the same policy towards the Marris, who up to this time had been excluded from all friendly intercourse with the British ; and a meeting took place at Rajan- pur, at which the Khetran, Bugti and Marri Chiefs, with one exception, were present. As a result it was arranged to place ten police sowars at the Marri capital of Kahan and to bestow five places in the frontier militia on the Chiefs of the tribe ; and similar action was taken in regard O■' Mi I ■ J3ALtJCHISTAN— Sihi Agency. to the liugti Cliiefs. Some success attended these measures so far as the Punjab frontier was concerned, but the tribes continued to raid the Siud border. In February 1871 a conference of officials of the Punjab and Sind was held at Mithankot with a view to secure unanimity of action in the management of the tribes. In accordance with the suggestions then made, it was determined that (1) the control of the relations of (jovernment with these tribes should be placed in the hands of the Poli tical Superintendent, Upper Sind Frontier, and that, in respect of these tribes, the Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazi Khan should be placed under him; (2) in addition to the sums which had previously been paid to the tribes for service on the border of the Punjab, Ps. 32,040 should be paid annually for the entertainment of horsemen belonging to the tribes, to maintain the tranquillity of the Sind as well as the Punjab frontier, and of the Kalat territory. The amount, the payment of which was provisional for one year, was to be handed over to the Chiefs in the name of the Khan. The rebellion against the Khan which broke out in Kalat in October 1871, and the troubles which followed, prevented the execution of the second of the measures decided on at Mithankot, except for the payment of a small subsidy, Ps. 5,520, to the Bugtis, who had behaved themselves. The state of affairs continued unsatisfactory: and in 1875 it was decided to put an end to the dual system of manage ment from the Punjab and Sind. The conduct of the tribes was to be considered as a whole; and the Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazi Khan was, under the Commissioner in Sind, to be the medium of communioations with the Marris and Bugtis in all their branches. In November 1875 Captain Sandeman was deputed to the hills to try and bring about an amicable settlement of the tribal quarrels and to provide for the security of the Bolan route, lie succeeded in getting the Brahui, Marri and Bugti Chiefs to accompany him to Kalat and to attend a darbar held by the Khan. The result, however, was not completely satisfactory, as rebellions and raids continued. Captain Sandeman was despatched on a second mission to Kalat in 1876, from which resulted the Treaty of Jacobabad (No. XII) and a reconciliation between the Khan and his rebellious Sardars. It was then decided to continue to the Bugtis and Marris the allowances paid since 1875, and to deal with them independently of the Khan. In February 1877, on the establish ment of the Baluchistan Agency, relations with the Marris and Bugtis became closer. The Bugtis have throughout behaved well. With the Marris relations remained on a tolerably satisfactory footing till the disaster of Maiwand in 1880. On hearing of this the Marris broke out again and, besides committing other acts of violence, attacked and looted a Government convoy on the Harnai line in August 1880. A force was sent into their country to exact retribution for these outrages: and the two leading Marri Chiefs, Mehrulla Khan and Karam Khan, came in and accepted the terms laid down by Government. These were the resti-BALUCHISTAN— Sibi Agency. 345 tutiou of the treasure and bullocks plundered from the couvoy; the pay ment of a line of lis. 20,000 to compensate private losses; the pay ment of blood mouey according to tribal custom for those slain; an unopposed passage to the troops marching through the Marri country by Kalian to Hairand; and the giving of hostages for the future good behaviour of the clan, ihe tribe complied with these conditions, and friendly relations were resumed on the former basis of tribal payments and service. The Harris took part in the Sumari outrage in 1896, in which they killed eleven men, and also in the unrest which occurred in 189h and which ended in the son of the Marri Qhief emigrating tem porarily to Afghanistan. Again in 191 with the spread of false rumours of the impending- victories of the Turks and Germans, the Marris began to get restless. Ihe tribe broke into open rebellion in 1918, deserted their levy posts, cut the telegraph lines between Kohlu and Grumbaz and made several attacks on the Sind-Pishin Railway. The Political Agent, Sibi, was sent to make enquiries. He found all the passes closed by hostile gangs, and while at Grumbaz was attacked by a large force of Marris, which was driven off with heavy loss. The Marris retired and, assisted by the Khetrans, destroyed Government buildings at Kohlu, Barkhan, Bawata and 1 ort Munro, besides looting the Barkhan treasury. A punitive expedition was despatched and a fight ensued at Mamand, where the Marri Chief finally surrendered unconditionally and accepted the Government terms which, in addition to compensation for private and Government damages, included confiscation of all Muafis and titles: the return of all Government rifles and ammunition captured during the rebellion : an increase in the revenue; the permanent cession of the land temporarily laid out as an Aerodrome, and its further main tenance at the expense of the tribe; and an undertaking to meet the expenses of a cart road through the country whenever called upon to make it. Since this much needed lesson the internal affairs of the country and the tribe have been satisfactory. Petroleum having been discovered in the Marri country, the Tuman- dar, Sardar Mehrulla Khan, executed in October 1885 an Agreement (No. XVII) by which he ceded to the British Government his rights to petroleum and all other mineral oils in consideration of an annual cash payment. Ihis agreement was formally cancelled by the Government of India in 1927, when the Tumandar was left free to enter into negotia tions for the exploitation of mineral oil in the Marri country. In September 1925 the Indo-Burma Petroleum Company, with the sanction of the Governor-General in Council, entered into an agreement with the Bugti Tumandar Muhammad Mehrab Khan, to explore the Bugti area for petroleum; but, owing to the refusal of the Tumandar toUi) BALUCHISTAN -Sibi Agvficy. agree to certain terms offered by them, the Company decided in Septem ber 1928 to discontinue the operations. The present Bug-ti Tumandar is Sardar Bahadur Nawab Muham- mad Mehrab Khan, who succeeded his father Shahbaz Khan in 1917. He received the title of Sardar Bahadur in 19UG, and the personal title of Nawab in 1918. The present Marri lumandar is Khan Bahadur Muhammad Mehrulla Khan, who succeeded his father Mir Khair Bakhsh Khan on the 28tli January 1925. He received the title of Khan Bahadur in 1927. Both tribes are under the control of the Political Agent in Sibi. The task of the political officers is chiefly confined to the settlement of inter tribal cases either between the Marris and Bugtis themselves, whose relations are frequently strained, or with the neighbouring tribes of the Loralai district and the Punjab. The area of the Marri country is 3,o92 square miles, and that of the liuo-ti countrv 3,870 square miles. The population of the two areas was. in 1921, 37,024.BALUCHJSTAN- -British Baluchistan and Agency Territories. 347 BRITISH BALUCHISTAN AND AGENCY TERRITORIES. British Baluchistan consists of the tahsils of Pishin and Chaman, which form the Pishin District: the tahsils of Sihi and Shahrig-, which form the Sibi District: the Duki District which forms part of the Loralai Agency: and the Shorarud District which forms part of the Chagai Agency. The Agency Territories are the assigned Niahats of Quetta, Nasirabad, the Bolan Pass and Nushki: the Loralai Agency, except the tahsil of Duki: the Zhob Agency: and the Chagai and Western Sinjerani country, except the tahsil of Shorarud. The districts of Pishin, Sibi with its dependencies of Thal-Chotiali and Harnai, Duki and Shorarud are under the administration of the Agent to the Governor-General in his ex-officio capacity as Chief Com missioner of British Baluchistan. Till 1878 they formed part of the dominions of the Amir of Afghanistan. When war with Afghanistan was declared in that year they were immediately occupied by British troops, and under the Treaty of Gandamak [see Vol. XIII, Afghanistan) executed in May 1879, their administration was to remain with the British Government, any surplus revenue being paid to the Amir. In September 1879, however, war broke out again, and ended in the abdica tion of Yakub Khan and the accession to power of Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. He was informed that these districts had ceased to form part of Afghanistan; and they have since remained in the possession of the British Government. They were incorporated with British India in 1887, and are officially known as the Province of British Baluchistan. Loralai, Zhoh and Chagai Agencies. —The Bori and Zhob Valleys lie to the north of Harnai and Thal-Chotiali. In consequence of outrages committed by the Kakars of Zhob a punitive expedition was sent against them. Shah Jahan, the leading Zhob Chief, was deposed, and a relation, Sardar Shahbaz Khan, was set up in his stead. An Agreement (No. XV) was taken in November 1884 from the Maliks of Zhob, Bori and the Musa Khel, by which they undertook to put a stop to raiding into British territory; to prevent Shah Jahan and his chief adherent, Saifulla Khan, from returning to Zhob; to pay a fine of lis. 22,000; and to raise no opposition to the location of British troops in Zhob and Bori. In 1887 a British force was stationed at Loralai in the Bori valley for the protec tion of the frontier road from Dera Ghazi Khan to Pishin. In the same year Bori, and the country of the Khetran tribes lying between Thal- Chotiali and the Punjab, were, with the acquiescence of the Chiefs and people, brought more directly under the political and administrative control of the Baluchistan Agency. About the same time Shah Jahan and Saifulla Khan submitted and were permitted to return to their homes; and Sardar Shahbaz Klian, who was in delicate health, deputed his authority to Shah Jahan's eldest surviving son Shingul Khan,348 BALUOilJSTAN— British Baluchistan and Agency Territories. In 1888-89 Sardar Shahbaz Khan, Shah Jahan Khan, Shingul Khan and the chief Zhob Maliks made a request that Zhob as well as Bori might be brought under more direct British control. When in 1889-90 it was decided to open up the Gomal Pass, the occupation of Zhob was sanctioned ; and a Political Agent was appointed to take charge of the district, which included Bori and the country of the Khetran, Kibzai ana Musa Khel. Ihe country of the Bargha Shiranis, Zimarais, Isots, Jafirs and Kharshins, tribes occupying different parts of the Suliman range and intervening between Zhob and the Punjab, was subsequently added to the district. In 1903 the Bori valley with the Barkhan, Musa Khel and Thal-Chotiali (Duki) tahsils, and the Sinjawi sub-tahsil, were formed into a separate district, called the Loralai district. The Khanai Hindubagh Railway was constructed in 1917. The extension from Hindubagh to Fort Sandeman of the Zhob Valley Railway was completed in 1929. In 1890 the Government of India decided that the line of the Gomal iner, between its junction with the Kundar and Zhob rivers, sliould he the limit of tubal jurisdiction between the IN orth-AVest Frontier Agency (then the Punjab Government) and the Baluchistan Agency. By the Durand agreement of 1893 the Sinjerani country, extending from Chagai to Sistan, came under the administration of tie Baluchis tan Agency. The boundary of this tract was demarcated in 1896, and a road suitable for camel traffic was constructed in 1897-99 between Quetta, Nushki and Sisfan. Ihe Quetta-Xushki Railway was opened at the close of 1905. The Nushki Extension Railway, which reached Duzdap in February 191!), was opened in April 1919, while the portion from Ahmedwal to Dalbandin was opened in October 1919. In July 1926 the Shorarud Valley was transferred from the Quetta District to the charge of the Political Agent, Chagai. Nushki, Chagai and Western Sinjerani country were incorporated in Baluchistan Agency territories in May 1929. At the beginning of 1890 negotiations in connection with the opening of the Gomal Pass were, entered into with the Bargha Shiranis, as a result of which they were taken into service (No. XIX), and given an allowance of Rs. 7,680 a year. In 1891 the arrangement whereby the Bargha Shiranis were placed under the Baluchistan Agency, which had been made after the Zhob Expedition of 1890, was confirmed by the Government of India. In the same year the tribe was called upon to pay revenue for the first time. In 1894 the Bargha Shiranis agreed to submit a long standing boundary dispute with the Mianis to the arbitration of the political authorities, and accepted their decision. In 1895 the boundarv me between the Bargha and Largha Shiranis, the latter of whom are under the jurisdiction of the North-West Frontier Province, was settledtarn BALTJCHISrAN British Baluchistan and Agency Territories. 349 | I with, tlie consent of both parties (No. XXI). In the same year the tribe was fined Rs. 4,200 for its complicity in certain outrages committed ok the Dhana road in the Shirani country, when Lieutenant Home, R.E., and his attendants '\Aeie mui'dered. The Barg'ha Shiran is rendered loyal assistance in 1902 during the disturbance connected with the murder of Arbab Faiid Khan, l^xtia Assistant Commissioner m the Largha Shirani country. In 1897 an Agreement (No. XXIV) was made with the Suliman Khel Ghilzai, whereby the sections of the tribe in the Zhob district were to pay tirni (grazing fees) for their animals while grazing within the British border and, among other conditions, to be responsible for the good behaviour of their sections while within the Zhob tracts, and for the detection of offences committed within the limits where their sections resided. They were, in return, granted an annual allowance of Rs. 1,550. O t \ ing to the difficulty, however, of collecting the tivni from the sections of the tribe on the Punjab frontier, the agreement remained inoperative in 1898; but the sections in the Zhob district then agreed in writing to act independently of their brethren in this matter for the future, and since 1899 the allowances have been regularly paid. With the sanction of the Government of India, the rates mentioned in the Agreement were doubled in 1923, both in the North-West Frontier Pro vince and Baluchistan. In 1918 the Khetrans belonging to the Loralai District rose in revolt, in sympathy with the Marris. The rising was put down by a small expeditionary force which entered the Marri country via Gumbaz and proceeded via Kohlu to Barkhan. Terms were imposed on the Khetrans. In 1919 Loralai was made the Headquarters of the Zhob Area, which includes Port Sandeman and the Zhob Valley: and the force was brought up to the strength of an Independent Brigade. Between 1919 and 1922, owing to the Afghan disturbances and the defection of a considerable portion of the Zhob Militia, a series of raids took plaee in various parts of the Loralai district.HtaHBMKBMBBBHBBHBHB 350 BALUCHISTAN—NO. 1—1839.

In accordance with the agreement for the delimitation of the Perso-Kalat frontier from Kohak to Koh-i-Malik Siah, drawn up between Her Britannic Ma jesty's Minister at Tehran and His Highness the Sadar-i-Azam of Persia, dated the 27th December 1895, this frontier has been demarcated as follows Commencing from the Mashkel river it is defined by the bed of that river from pillar 1 to pillar 2. Pillar 1 is placed on a conspicuous hill on the left or north bank of the river, about a mile and a half below the junction of the Gazbastan stream with the Mashkel, and almost immediately south of Kohak Fort. Pillar 2 is built on a well marked hill on the right or south bank of the Mash kel river about 6 miles above the junction of the Mashkel and Eakshan rivers. From pillar 2 the boundary runs in a north-westerly direction to a conspicuous peak on the subsidiary range which runs from the Tank-i-Grawag to the Siahan872 BALUCH J STAN—N U. XXJ1—1896. The peak is marked by pillar 3. From pillar 3 it follows the watershed of thia subsidiary range to its junction with that of the Siahan Koh and thence it is de fined westward by the main watershed of the Siahan range to a point about 4 miles east of the pass called Bonsar or Sharindor, on the main road connecting Isfandak with Jalk. At this point, which is marked by pillar 4, a subsidiary watershed or spur runs northward, along which the boundary extends, leaving all drainage into the cultivated tracts of Kalagam on the Persian side. The bound ary is here marked by a conspicuous peak, distinguished by a natural bluff resem bling a tower on its summit. From this peak 5, it is carried to pillar 6, which is placed on the main road leading a little south of east from the village of Kaladen towards the Mashkel river. Pillar 6 is 4 miles from the village of Kaladen. From pillar 6 the boundary runs direct to pillar 7 on the main road connecting Jalk with Ladgasht and Mashkel at 12 miles from Zirat-i-Pir-Omar at Jalk. From pillar 7 the boundary is carried in a northerly direction by a straight line to pillar 8. Pillar 8 is placed on the road connecting the date groves of Ladgasht with t.iose of Muksokhta or Muksotag, and it is erected at a distance of 3 miles from the southern edge of the Muksotag grove, so as to divide the southern group of date groves, including Ladgasht and Kalag, from the northern group, which in cludes Muksotag, Gorani and others. Ladgasht, with its date groves, becomes the property of Kalat, and Gorani with its date groves, has been allotted to Persia, on the understanding that the frontier Govecnors of the Persian Government in future become responsible for the conduct of the Damani cultivators of these groves. From pillar 8 the boundary runs 14 miles nearly north to pillar 9 at the south eastern edge of the Kindi date grove, and thence in the same direction for 3| miles to the north-eastern edge of the same grove of Kindi, where pillar 10 is erected. From pillar 10 the boundary runs 11 miles a little south of west so as to clear the northern edge of the Kindi date grove, to pillar 11. Pillar 11 is on the edge of the right bank of the Talab watercourse, and about 1 mile east of the northern end of the Gorani date groves. From pillar 11 northwards the Talab river becomes the boundary to its junc tion with the Mirjawa river. From the point of junction it is carried by a straight line to the nearest point on the watershed of the Mirjawa range, which limits the drainage into the Mirjawa river on the north. Thence it follows the main watershed northward to the highest point of the Kacha Koh, From the highest point of the Kacha Koh the line is carried straight to the highest point of the Malik Siah Koh.

It then follows the southern limit of the Hamun as far as the Wad-i-Sultan, and after skirting the western limit of the Wad-i-Sultan to the northern limit of the Hamun, follows the latter until the neighbourhood of Reg-i-Wakhab is reached. After leaving the limits of the Hamun-i-Mashkel the boundary follows the line of sand-hills south of Reg-i-Wakhab and Galichah, until it reaches a point south west of Gaukok, where it bends north-east, and after skirting the western limit of the Gaukok Hamun, follows the crest of the Gaukok and the chain of low hills running from the Gaukok to the Raskoh range until that range is reached. It then follows the crest or watershed of the Raskoh as far as the Sultani Kand passBALUCHISTAN—NO.

HP HE North-West Frontier Province was inagnrated on the 9th i- November 1901. It was formed by separating from the Lientenant- (xovernorship of the Punjab the Mansehra, Abbottabad and Haripur tahsils of ITazara, the Peshawar and Kohat districts, the Bannu and Marwat tahsils of the Bannu district, and the Tank, Dera Ismail Khan and Kulachi tahsils of the Dera Ismail Khan district, with the exception of thirty three villages at the southern extremity of the Kulachi tahsil. One of these villages, Naranji, was subsequently, in 1902, transferred to the North-West Frontier Province. The above areas are now administer ed as five separate districts and form part of British India, but the province also comprises a large tract of tribal territory of which only small portions such as the Kurram and Tochi valleys are administered. This tribal territory, though included in India, is not part of British India. The head of the Local Administration, who in British India is styled Chief Commissioner, in tribal territory exercises authority as Agent to the Governor-General. The greater portion of tribal territory is comprised in the following Agencies: — Dir, Swat and Chitral (Malakand); Khyber; Kurram; Waziristan (North and South). But certain important tribes such as the Mohmands and the Shiranis are not included in any of the above Agencies. For the Deputy Com missioners of the five districts are also Political Agents in charge of relations with those tribes adjoining their districts whose countries are not included in any Agency. The line between the districts and tribal territory is commonly called the border and must be distinguished from the frontier of India or ( 387 )388 NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE— Introduction. Duraud Line which runs on the north and west sides of the tiibal territory. The border may he taken to start from the head of the Kaghan valley whence it runs south-west to the river Indus and thence down the left bank of the Indus to Torbela, where it crosses the river and follows the foot of the hills on the northern and north-western sides of the Peshawar valley to the Khyber Pass. From the Khyber Pass it runs along the foot of the Afridi hills in a southerly and south-westerly direc tion to the mouth of the Kohat Pass and thence nearly due east to the neighbourhood of Cherat, so as to exclude the Kohat Pass and all territory occupied by Afridis, and from its most easterly point turns south and west again to the neighbourhood of Ivohat. From Kohat it runs in a south-westerly direction and passes along the summit of the Samana ridge which separates the Miranzai valley of the Bangash from Orakzai country in Tirah, It touches the Kurram river in the neighbourhood of Thai and thence again runs sharply eastwards so as to exclude the country of the Kabul Khel and othei AA aziis. From, a point in the neighbourhood of Bahadur Khel it turns south west towards Bannu, crossing the Ivurram and Tochi rivers near where they emerge from the hills, and leaving the Bannuchis, Marwats and some of the settled Wazirs in the Bannu district and other Wazirs and the Bhitannis outside it to the west. From the south-west corner of the Bannu district the border crosses the Sheikh- buddin range in the neighbourhood of the Bain Pass and thence runs southwards past Tank in the Dera Ismail Khan district to the Gumal river and then south again to the neighbourhood of Draband where the Dera Ismail Khan district meets the Dera Ghazi Khan dis trict of the Punjab. The tribal country of the Shiranis to the west of the border of the Dera Ismail Khan district is divided between the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan. The tribes from Hazara to Dera Ismail Khan and the northern limits of Baluchistan who live between the border of the districts and the Durand Line are, with a few insignificant exceptions, of Pathan origin. The population of this belt of tribal territory has never been enumerated, but the number of fighting men is estimated at nearly half a million men, of whom a varying but considerable proportion are well armed. The Treaty between Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Shah Shuja, con cluded in March 1834, {see Vol. I, Part I, pages 4-5), enumerates the frontier territories possessed by the Maharaja: ' the Fort of Attoc&lt;, Chach, Hazara, Kabel, Amb, with its dependencies, on the left bank of the Indus: and, on the right bank, Peshawar with the Yusufzai territory, Khattaks, Hashtnagar, Michni, Kohat, and all places depend ent on Peshawar as far as the Khaibar Pass; Bannu, the Wazin terri tory, Dawar, Tank, Girang, Kalabagh and Khushalgarh with their dependent districts; Dera Ismail Khan, and its dependency, together with Dera Ghazi Khan, Kot Mithan and their dependent territory,NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PliOYmCE—Introduction. 389 Sangarh, Harand, Dajal, Hajipur, llajipur, and the tliree Kacliis, as well as Mansera witli its district and tlie Province of Mult an, situated on tlie left bank The Sikh method of administering the border tribes was of the loosest description. Strong forces were maintained at the headquarters of districts, round which a semblance of authority existed; next followed a belt of country owning a doubtful allegiance, and paying revenue at uncertain intervals under compulsion; at a further distance from the garrisons the power of the Sikh governors diminished considerably; and lastly came the tribes who openly asserted their independence. The Sikhs looked mainly to the realisation of the revenue; for the rest the tribes conducted matters in their own way. Consequently the Sikh armies rarely, if ever, penetrated so far as to inflict punishment on the tribes in the hills, and the latter considered themselves unconquerable, and the plains their prey. On the annexation of the Punjab in 1849, in the strong hands of such frontier officers as Edwardes and Nicholson, the tracts inside the border were brought under administration, and the relations of the British Government with the inhabitants of tribal terri tory have ever since been characterised by the constant strife inevitable when a civilised administration marches with a tract inhabited by law less men whose immemorial habit has been the plunder of their less war like neighbours. This state of strife, intensified by the difficult nature of the tribal country and, as has often been the case, by the easily aroused fanaticism of the Muhammadan tribesman, has led to numerous campaigns from the year 1852 onwards and the campaigns in turn produced a crop of treaties and engagements with the tribes which are recorded in this volume. The first frontier expedition of importance was the Ambeyla campaign of 1863, which owed its origin to the activi ties of the Wahhabi colony known as the Hindustani Fanatics. The most notable subsequent landmarks in the history of the North-West Frontier are the Second Afghan War of 1878-80; the delimitation in 1893 of the Durand Line, India's western frontier and, where local conditions admit ted, its demarcation; the period of activity which followed and which resulted in the creation of the Dir, Swat and Chitral Agency and the occupation of the Tochi valley and Wana in Waziristan; the tribal reaction to'this activity which brought about the general rising of 1897; the widespread unrest which followed the outbreak of war with Afghan istan in 1919; and the series of spectacular outrages which occurred between 1920 and 1923:—the murder of Colonel and Mrs. Foulkes in 1920, the murder of Mrs. Ellis and the abduction of Miss Ellis in April 1923; the attack, in both these instances, being made on private houses situated in the heart of the Kohat cantonment; and the murder of Captain and Mrs. Watts at Parachinar in November 1923. A striking exception to the tale of tribal misbehaviour was furnished by the mutiny of 1857, when the tribesmen behaved excellently through-390 NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE—/nfroducfton. out the crisis, aud numbers Uocked down to India to take service against the mutineers. Again, during the Great War of 1914-18, even after the entry of Turkey into the war, the behaviour of the frontier tribes was, on the whole, excellent, the only exceptions being the Mohmands and the Mahsuds. The relations of the British Government with the frontier tribes have inevitably been affected by those between the British Government and Afghanistan. From 1877 to 1881 the frontier was disturbed owing to the dispute between the British Government and the Amir Sher Ali which resulted in the Afghan War of 1878-80. During the reigns of Abdur Rahman and his son Ilabibulla relations were consistently good; though raiding in British territory by Afghan gangs, who mostly had their headquarters in Khost, assisted by outlaws from British India and tribal territory, put a considerable strain on the vigilance of the British authorities. The murder, in February 1919, of Ilabibulla, whose open declaration of neutrality had greatlv contributed to the peace of the frontier during the Great War, and the subsequent pro ceedings of his successor Amanulla, caused wide-spread disturbances; but, since the ratification of the Treaty with Afghanistan in February 1922*, the record of steady progress has been manifest in the reconcilia tion of the tribes: and this was scarcely disturbed by the Afghan revolu tion and the period of anarchy that intervened between the flight of Amanulla and the accession of Nadir Shah. Much progress has been made, of late years, in strengthening the defence of the border. In 1913 the Border Military Police were replaced b\ the Frontier Constabulary, whose special duties are the patrolling of the border, the prevention of raids, and the capture of raidiuo- gangs and outlaws. The Frontier Constabulary also supervise the District Levies m the Kohat, Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan districts; while the Dir and vSwat Levies remain under the control of the Political Agent at Malakand. There are four trans-border Corps—the Chitral Scouts, the Kurram Militia, the Tochi Scouts and the South Waziristan Scouts: the two latter having replaced the old North and South Waziristan Militia. Their primary duties are to prevent raids, ensure the safety of communications, and deal with minor tribal disturbances. Shortly after the outbreak of the Afghan War of 1919 most of the Khyber Rifles were disbanded and, subsequently in 1920 on the disband- ment of the remnant, a force of Khassadars, or tribal levies on a purely tribal basis, supplying their own arms, was raised to replace this Corps • Khassadars are now employed on an extensive scale, especially in Wazir istan, where this form of service, of which the essence is that the Khassadar provides his own rifle and ammunition, is now exceedindv * Rpe Vol. XTTT, Afghanistan.NORTH-WEST FRONTIER VROVmCE-Introduction. 391 The most important tribes of the North-West Frontier Province are enumerated below.

The two great divisions of the Wazirs are the Darwesh Khel and the Mahsuds, each of which is usually reckoned as a separate tribe * the name Wazir being commonly confined to the Darwesh Khel, The fighting strength of the two tribes together is estimated at 50,000.

The trans-border tribes under the political control of the Deputy Com missioner, llazara, are the Swath is; the Pariari Saiyids; certain divi sions and sections of the Yusafzai; and the trans-Indus Tanaolis whose cliiei is the Nawab of Amb. 1. SWATHIS. The Swathis are not pure Pathans, but appear to be of Indian origin. Retiring before the invasions of the Yusafzai, who wrested from them Swat and Buner, they crossed the Indus and settled in the tracts which they now occupy.' The trans-border Swathi tracts are Allai, Nandihar, Tikri, Deshi and Thakot. During the Black Mountain expedition of 1868, the Allaiwals attacked one of the survey camps. They were summoned-to answer for their conduct, but did not do so. In the same year the Deshiwals took part, with the other Black Mountain tribes, in the invasion of the Agror Valley, and a fine of lis. 1,000 was exacted from them. In 1874 the Allaiwals under Arsala Khan, in prosecution of a tend with the Kohistanis, violated British territory. Retaliatory measures were taken and a blockade established. In 1875 the Allaiwal jirga came in, apologised and paid a fine. At the same time they entered into a written Agreement (No. I) for the maintenance of friendly relations for the future, and for the surrender of property stolen from British territory. Arsala Khan himself did not, however, tender his submission, and the agreement was never acted up to. In 1876 the Deshiwals sent in their jirga to testify their good will to the British Government. In 1877 a gang of Nandihari outlaws was broken up and their leader, Abbas Khan, was captured and imprisoned. In 1878 Arsala Khan attacked Battal in the Konsh- Valley, and carried off some Hindu British subjects: and other raids were made by a son of Abbas Khan.. The Allaiwals were closely blockaded until 1880, when they gave in and surrendered the Hindus captured at Battal. In 1887 raids were committed by the Madda Khel Miyans, living at the head of Allai: and in and before that year men from Tikri and the neighbouring Black Mountain glens, known as Pariari and inhabited by Saiyids and Basi Khel Chagarzai, joined in raids on British territory. During the Black Mountain expedition of 1888 Tikri was occupied and a fine of Es. 1,000 was levied from the chief men: and in November the Nandiharis and Tikriwals entered into Agreements (Noe. II and III). Arsala Khan and the Allai jirga were summoned,NOimi-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE—HAZARA DISTRICT— Swathis and 395 Yusafzai. but refused to come in; whereupon a force crossed from N audi liar to Allai aud destroyed the village of Pokal. In 1892, after the Black Mountain expedition of 1891, the Nandiharis, Tikriwals and Deshiwals were granted annual allowances of I?s. 1,000 on condition of rendering general service when required. There is a long standing quarrel between Bradar Khan of Thakot and the Wali of Swat over the recovery of timber tolls on the Indus. In 1924 Bradar Khan's property on the right bank of the Indus was seized by the Wali of Swat, and in the following year he was ousted from Thakot by the Khans of Allai and Nandihar, supported by the Wali of Swat. Bradar Khan appealed to Government for the restoration to him of Thakot, and orders were passed that the Wali of Swat should not interfere on the left bank, nor Bradar Khan on the right bank of the Indus. In 1925, when Survey operations were undertaken in certain tribal tracts, including Nandihar, the Swathis generally behaved well and put no obstacles in the way of the Survey Party. In 1928-29 Survey operations were undertaken in Tikri-Nandihar, etc. The attitude of the tribes concerned was generally friendly and the work was completed without much difficulty. The Pariari Saiyids however at first refused to admit the Survey Party but eventually they agreed under pressure. In June 1930 a lashkar consisting mostly of Talib-ul-Ilms from Allai, numbering about 200, threatened the Agror Valley, but retired on encountering opposition from the Frontier Constabulary and a small column of regulars supported by a contingent of the Nawab of Amb's men. 2. YTTSAFZAI.* The trans-border Yusafzai under the political control of the Deputy Commissioner, Hazara, are the Isazai clan (consisting of the Akazai, Hassanzai and Madda Khel divisions): the Amazai division of the TJsmanzai clan; the Basi Khel sub-division of the Chagarzai (who, though properly forming part of the Malizai sub-division of the Khwazozai division of the Akozai clan, are generally reckoned as a separate division of the Akozai) living with the Pariari Saiyids: and the trans-Indus Utmanzai whose principal villages are Kabal and Kaya, In 1851 the Hassanzai murdered two officers of the Salt Department, and in 1852 made an attack on the territory of the Nawab of Amb. A force was sent against them in December 1852, and they were punished, but did not tender their submission.. * For the history of the tribe see Part III, Peshawar District.396 NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROV1KCE—HAZARA DISTRICT— Yusafzai. The Utmanzai of Kabal and Kaya gave every assistance in the operations against the Hindustani Fanatics of Sitana in ]858; but when, in 1861, the Fanatics made a fresh settlement in Amazai territory, the Utmanzai weie called to account for permitting them to re-settle and to pass through their country to and from British territory. A blockade was instituted, and in September 18G1 they agreed (No. IV) to the terms imposed upon them. In August 1803 ihe Hassanzai raided some Tanawal villages. On the conclusion of the Ambeyla campaign of 1803, Agreements were taken, in January 1804, from the Utmanzai (No. Y), Madda Khel (No. VI), Amazai (No. VII) and Hassanzai (No. VIII); all of whom agreed to exclude the Hindustani Fanatics from their limits. In July 1808 the Hassanzai, in concert with the Akazai and Ohagarzai, attacked a British police post at Oghi in the Agror Valley. A small force was despatched from Abbottabad and, on arrival at Oghi, was joined by a contingent under the Nawab of Amb. The presence of this force successfully prevented the occupation of the Agror Valley: and in the following October iin expedition, which included a Kashmir contingent furnished in accordance with the Treaty of Amritsar [see Vol. XII, Kashmir No. I), was despatched against the Black Mountain tribes. 1 heir submission was accepted : and the Akazai were informed that the village of Shahtut, within the British frontier, which they had hitherto held rent-free as an independent village, would in future be assessed and held by them as British subjects. The attack on Oghi was traced to the instigation of Ata Muhammad Khan, Khan of Agror, who was removed in 1808 to Lahore as a State prisoner; his jagir of the annual value of Us. 1,008 was confiscated, and his estates were placed under the management of a British officer. Eaids continued to be mode by the Hassanzai and Akazai during his confinement; and it was found necessary to blockade them and burn Shahtut. Ata Muhammad Khan was permitted to return to Agror in 1870, and was reinstated in the posses sion of his estates, but not of his jagir, on condition that he was to be responsible for the internal peace of the valley as well as for the security and protection of the frontier, and with a warning that any hostile or treasonable action on his part against the British Government would entail his dispossession and removal. After the return of the Khan, the troops which had been stationed in Agror were withdrawn; but the raids did not cease, the principal offenders being the Akazai. After .1872 matters somewhat improved; but in April 1875 a serious raid, in which they were joined by the Nasrat Khel and Basi Khel sub-divisions of the Cbagarzai, was com mitted by the Akazai, and the Khan Khel sub-division of the Hassanzai, on the British village of Ghanian, in the Agror Valley. Before any measures for the punishment of the tribes could be decided upon, a2'i NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE—HAZARA DISTRICT— Yusafzai. 397 quarrel took place between the Hassanzai and Akazai, wkicli led, mainly through the influence of the independent Saiyids of Tilli, to the volun tary and complete submission, in September 1875, of the Akazai, who engaged to abstain from all opposition to Government—a promise which they did not keep. The Nasrat Khel Chagarzai came in at the same time : and in December the Hassanzai and their allies, the Basi Khel Chagarzai, also came in and professed a desire for pardon. In the meantime Shahtut was occupied and the land distributed among other communities. Ata Muhammad Khan died in 1875 and was succeeded by his son Ali Grauhar Khan. In 1882 the question of restoring Shahtut to the Akazai came under consideration. Government were willing to restore it on a tribal guarantee for good behaviour. The majority of the tribe were prepared to give the required engagement; but, as a sub-section of the clan declined, the negotiations fell through for the time. In March 1882 Hashim Ali Khan, the nominal Chief of the Hassanzai, raided a village near Oghi in Agror; but the tribe was not believed to lie implicated. Disputes between the Khan of Agror and his cousin Abdulla Khan, of Dilbori, regarding the latter's land interests in the Agror Valley, culminated in 1884 in active hostility. Abdulla Khan secured the aid of the Saiyids of Pariari with their Chagarzai tenants, and of a section of the Akazai: and these tribes committed numerous raids throughout the summer of 1884 on the villages of the valley. A blockade was established, and in September 1884 a small military force was sent against them while engaged in attacking the village of Ghanian. The tribes were routed and driven out of British territory. Petty raids continued for some months afterwards; but in October 1885 the Pariari Saiyids and the Chagarzai submitted, paid the lines imposed upon them, and gave hostages for future good conduct. In November 1887 a servant of Hashim Ali Khan of Seri, Chief of the Hassanzai, was charged with several murders in Agror and was arrested and put on trial. Disregarding friendly messages asking him to send in the witnesses named by his servant for his defence, Hashim Ali Khan sent a raiding party into Agror, which killed two men and carried off two others. In the following June Major Battye, with a company of the 2-5th Gurkhas, while making a route march on the Black Mountain, ,was attacked by a gang of Gujars and others of Akazai villages; Major Battye, Captain IJrmston, and a few Gurkhas were surrounded, overpowered and killed. For some years past the glaring offences of the Khan Khel Hassanzai and Akazai had been met merely by the imposition of fines on paper and by a blockade: and in 1888 it was decided to send an expedition against the Hassanzai, Akazai and Pariariwals. The Hassanzai were com-398 NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE—HAZARA DISTRICT— Ymaftai. pelled to pay a fine of Rs. 7,500, the Akazai a fine of Es. 4,000, and the Pariariwals Rs. 1,500: and hostage were taken from each clan. At the same time, before the force returned to British territory, the jirgas of the Hassanzai and Akazai made Agreements (Nos. IX and X) with CTOvernment. The most important terms in these agreements were that the clans acknowledged their responsibility for Hashim Ali Khan, or their Chief, whoever he might be, and bound themselves to control his behaviour. They also acknowledged the right of the British Govern ment to send its servants, troops, or police, along its own border on the crest of the Black Mountain : and promised to attend when summoned to accompany any troops making a peaceable march on this border. The Akazai also admitted that they had no claim to Shahtut, which had long been a source of contention on the Black Mountain. In 1888 AH Gauhar Khan of Agror was removed from the border for complicity in many of the raids and disturbances of the past years. Abdulla Khan of Dilbori surrendered in 1889 and was imprisoned, but released early in 1890. Though no agreement was entered into by the Chagaizai of the northern slopes of the Black Mountain, a large jirga of the clan visited the Deputy Commissioner in 1889 and professed resolves to remain in friendship and peace with Government. In 1890 Government determined to make certain roads in Agror up to and along the crest of the Black Mountain, and to send a small force to march along the crest, and thus assert the intention of holding the clans to their agreement. The tribes were invited to send in deputa tions to arrange either to assist in these projects, or at least to see that no offence 'v\as offered. Shortly before the troops actuallv started, the clans were warned that if, in violation of their agreements, they attempt ed to molest or oppose British troops marching peaceably on the border. the\ would be severely punished. To all warnings and advice they turned a deaf ear, and permitted Hashim Ali Khan, some Akazai headmen and other leading malcontents, to assemble bodies on the crest of the hill to oppose the force sent from Abbottabad. When the inten tion of the clans was clearly proved by their firing at the camp at Barchar, the troops retired, under orders, and the TTassanzai and Akazai were warned that they would be punished by an expedition to be sent against them in the spring. In pursuance of this threat the Black Mountain expedition of 1891 was undertaken. The Hassanzai and Akazai were warned that their unconditional submission was demanded: and the Madda Khel were told that they must join the other clans in any final arrangement of which Government might approve regarding the Khanship of Seri. In May 1891 the tribes accepted all the term^ demanded, save that of the surrender of Hashim Ali Khan, which his flight had put out of their power. They also undertook to keep Fashim Ah out of their country and to surrender him if he returned to it. TheXI NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PHOVINOE—IIAZARA DCSmiOT-rujo/rni. 399 Hassanzai and Akazai executed an Agreement (No. XI) embodying the terms imposed. The Madda Ehel followed and made a similar Agree- ment (i T o. XII). Before the force broke up the headmen of Pariari came into Oghi and executed an Agreement (No. XIII) of a similar nature. In January 1892 the Government of India sanctioned the follow- mg annual allowances: Hassanzai Rs. 1,700, Akazai Rs. 800, Madda Ahel Rs. 1,000, Panaris Rs. 500; while Rs. 2,000 a year was to be paid to Ibrahim Khan, who was accepted as Khan of Seri and was given the confiscated Khani lands of Hashim Ali Khan, which the tribes gicint to the de facto Khan for the support of the Chiefship. In 1892, however, the Hassanzai and Madda Khel allowed Hashim ^ i to return to their country and to settle at Baio. In August of that year they were warned that, if they did not surrender or expel him within a month, they would be punished; and,, as they persisted in refusing compliance, a force was sent in October to Baio, which was found empty. The defences were destroyed, and the force was with drawn, Hashim Ali being still at large. In 3900 Ibrahim Khan's allow- ance was reduced to Rs. 1,000 and that of the Hassanzai increased by the same amount. Subsequently Rs. 300 out of Ibrahim Khan's allow ance was transferred to Rahim Khan of Mirabad. Hie Amazai took no part in the disturbances of 1888 or 1891-92. They kept their agreement to exclude the Hindustani Fanatics from their territory until 1893, when Maulvi Abdulla, the leader of the colony, again entered into negotiations, as a result of which the colony was allowed to re-settle in the country of the Mubarak Khel Amazai. In the altered circumstances no notice was taken of the colony's re settlement; but the Amazai were from time to time given to understand clearly that they were responsible for the behaviour of the colony. The Amazai gave little trouble during the disturbances of ,1897. In 1898, at the time of the Buner expedition, the Hindustani Fanatics moved their headquarters from Mubarak Khel limits, but returned later: and the Mubarak Khel were again informed that, if they gave shelter to the colony, they were absolutely responsible for its behaviour. The headquarters of the Hindustani Fanatics are now at Samasta in Madda Khel country. The Ftmanzai were practically unaffected by the general fanaticism of 1897. Their feuds with the Salar Gaduns led to some villages of both tribes being put under a short blockade in 1901, which was removed at the end of the year. Since the expedition of 1892 the general behaviour of the Isazai tribes has been satisfactory except for a general rising of the tribes on the Hazara border in 1920.400 NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE—HAZARA DISTRICT— Yusafzai and Tanaolis.

Ali Gauhar Khan, e^-Khan of Agror, died in 1924. His son Badi-uz- Zaman Khan was appointed his successor, and a monthly allowance of Its. 550 was fixed for him. He was, however, not allowed to return to Agror, and the family resides at Hassan Abdal. In 1925 Survey operations were undertaken in certain tracts of tribal territory. With the exception of the Akazai, the attitude of the tribes concerned was friendly. The Akazai. however, destroyed the marks set up by the Survey Party on their first visit, and refused to allow the party to visit their territory on their return. 'Whenever called upon to send a jirga to see the Deputy Commissioner, they refused to do so, until December 1920, when they sent in a jirga to Abbottabad, ex- ] ressed repentance, and promised to remain friendly and to put no obstacles in Ihe way of the Survey Party when it next visits their territory. The Survey however has not yet been carried out. In 1920 the Utmanzai of Kabal and Kay a were called upon to a irrender certain outlaws reliably reported to be within their limits. Some of these were surrendered, and the tribe paid a fine of Rs. 4,000 for the rest. The Wali of Swat has been debarred from interfering with the Hassanzai, Akazai and Madda Khel. In 1980 Survey operations were successfully carried out in Azizwai, cis-Indus Hassanzai and Pitao Amazai territory. 3. TANAOLTS.

We know nothing about the other cases. We wish them passed over. 2nd. —We j^omise for the future on behalf of all Alahi that we will not commit any offence in British territory, and if any thefts take place, and Government sends us word, we will exact punishment. ord. —We sometimes have complaints against British subjects : we do not know anything of law and procedure, and hope that we may receive justice in some easy manner. 4th.— The claim of the Kohistanis for loss of property is exaggerated ; about 126 head were taken in the flock ; we offer Rs. 840, and hope this will be accepted by Government.

Apart from the State of Chitral, tlie trans-border tribes under the political control of the Political Agent, Dir, Swat and Chitral, are the Akozai, Iliaszai and Malizai clans of the Ynsafzai: certain sections of the Utman Khel : the Tarkanri: the Sam Ranizai : and various alien races of which the Baskari of Panjkora Kohistan, and the Torwal and Garwi of Swat Kohistan, are the most important. The Akozai inhabit the Swat Valley and Dir: the Iliaszai and Malizai, collectively known as the Bunerwals, inhabit liuner: the Tarkanri inhabit Bajaur: and the Sam Ranizai, a heterog-eneous mixture of Yusafzai, Utman Khel, etc., inhabit the area which lies between the Malakand range of hills and the border of British India. 1. CIIITRAL, Chitral was formerly divided into two States, lower or Chitral proper, and upper Chitral, including Yasin and Mastuj. Both States were governed by members «f the same family, claiming descent from a common ancestor named Muhammad Beg. Mohtaram Shah (Katur I) was Mehtar of lower Chitral, while his elder brother. Shah Khushwakt, was ruler of upper Chitrai. Aman-ul-Mulk, the Mehtar of lower Chitral and head of the Katur branch, for many years acknowledged allegiance to Kashmir. In 1878 he accepted an Agreement (No. 1) with the Maharaja, by which he acknow ledged subordination to Kashmir and undertook to receive an agent from,, and to send one to, the Darbar. Under this engagement he received an annual allowance of Rs. 12,000 from the Maharaja. In 1885 Chitral was visited by a British mission, and this visit was followed, in 1888, by one under Captain Durand, who was w T ell received. After his return the subsidy paid to the Mehtar by the Kashmir Darbar was raised first to Rs. 16,500 and then to Rs. 18,000, and an additional subsidy of Rs. 6,000 a year was granted by the British Government. Pahlwan Bahadur, Chief of upper Chitral, was also, though without any written agreement, for some years in receipt of a subsidy from Kashmir. He was, however, not satisfied with the way in which he was treated by the Darbar, and in 1880, he invaded Kashmir territory. The expedition was unsuccessful, and lie returned home to find that Yasin had been occupied during his absence by Aman-ul-Mulk, whom he was unable to oust. All Chitral thus became united under one Chief, and Pahlwan Bahadur died a few years afterwards a homeless fugitive. In 1892 Mehtar Aman-ul-Mulk died and was succeeded by one of his younger sons, named Afzal-ul-Mulk. His succession was recognised by the Government of India; but shortly afterwards he was murdered bv Sher Afzal, his father's brother, who seized the government of Chitral,N.-W. F. PROVINCE DIR, SWAT AND CHITRAL AGENCY— .^g but was soon attacked and expelled by Nizam-ul-Mulk, the eldest son of Aman-ul-Mulk. In the winter of 1892-93 a mission was despatched to the new Mehtar - izam-ul-Mulk. This mission returned to Gilgit in the following June, leaving a political officer at Chitral. In January 1895 Nizam-ul-Mulk was shot dead at the instigation of ns vounger half-brother Amir-ul-Mulk, who then seized the Chitral fort. this time Sher Afzal, the most popular candidate for the Mehtarship was interned at Kabul, and the Amir had given a written promise that ie wou (I not be again permitted to create disturbances in Chitral. The mir had ' moreover, undertaken in the Durand Agreement of 1893* that he would at no time exercise interference in Swat, Bajaur or Chitral. bhortly after Nizam-ul-Mulk's murder, tJmra Khan of Jandol, the brother-in-law of Amir-ul-Mulk, invaded Chitral with a force of Pathans and refused to obey the British Agent's orders to withdraw. I he Chitralis at first opposed Umra Khan; but, owing to the weakness and incapacity of Amir-ul-Mulk, and to treachery, the resistance col lapsed. In the meantime Sher Afzal arrived from Kabul and began to make common cause with TJmra Khan to induce the British officers, bv f ° rCe J i f necessar y? to quit Chitral territory. As soon as it became known that Sher Afzal was in the country, a few of the Chitralis went over to him, and before the end of February the Adamzadas (the noble class) practically joined him in a body. Amir-ul-Mulk now began to make overtures to Umra Khan. The British Agent therefore placed him in custody, and formally recognised Shuja-ul-Mulk, a boy of some 14 years, as provisional Mehtar, pending the orders of the Government of India! On the 3rd March fighting took place outside Chitral fort between Sher Afzal s foice and the British Agent's escort, which resulted in the latter having to retire into the fort. The British Agent and his escort of 400 men were besieged by Sher Afzal, with the Jandol Chiefs and Pathans aided by Chitralis, from the 4th March to the 19th April. On the night of the 18th, owing to the near approach of relieving troops from Gilgit, the whole force of the enemy quietly withdrew and aban doned the siege. On the 26th April, British troops crossed the Lowarai pass and entered Chitral territory. Sher Afzal was captured by the Khan of Dir, and with other leading men was sent down to India. Shortly afterwards Amir-ul-Mulk was also deported, and died in India in 1924. On the 2nd September the present Mehtar Shuja-ul-Mulk, younger brother of Amir-ul-Mulk, was installed as Mehtar of the Katur country in the name of the Maharaja of Kashmir as his suzerain, and with the authority and approval of the Government of India. At the same time the Khushwakt districts, Mastuj and Laspur west of the Shandur pass, were taken away from the Mehtar and placed under Governors over whom * See Vol. XIII, Afghanistan No. XII. ~ '41C N.-W. F. PROVINCE—DIR., SWAT AND CHITRAL AGENCY— Chitral. the Mehtar had no antliority. They were included, however, in the Chitral Agency. The Khushwakt districts on the east of the Shandur pass remained under separate Governors under the control of the Politi cal Agent, Gilgit. This separation of the Khushwakt districts from the Katur rule was in accordance with the request of the Khushwaktis, who had frequently declared their desire to have no more Katur Mehtars over them. The internal administration of Chitral was left in the hands of the Mehtar and his advisers, three advisers being appointed to assist him during his minority. But it was stipulated that traffic in slaves should be absolutely prohibited. In return for security from aggression the Government of India were to control the foreign relations of the State. A political officer was appointed, subordinate to the British Agent at Gilgit, to supervise affairs generally and to give advice and assistance to the Mehtar. A subsidy of lis. 1,000 a month was granted to the Mehtar, and a further sum of Rs. 8,000* a year to compensate him for loss of revenue arising from the separation of the Khushwakt country from hia control. A garrison sufficient to guarantee safety from foreign aggres sion and to provide a guard for the Mehtar was left in Chitral. In 1896 the Political Agency at Chitral was separated from Gilgit, and placed under the Political Agent for Dir, Swat and Chitral, who, on the formation of the North-West Frontier Province in 1901, was made subor dinate to the Chief Commissioner. In 1914 the districts of Mastuj (including Yarkhun and Kuh) and Laspur were transferred to the direct administration of the Mehtar, and an Agreement (No. II) was taken from the Mehtar regarding his rela tions with the inhabitants of those districts. During the Afghan War of 1919 the Chitral Scouts and Bodyguard co-operated with the movable column from Drosh in an attack on a body of Afghan regulars and tribesmen who bad occupied Arandu in Chitral limits. The action was most successful, the intruders being dispersed and the Afghan fort of Birkot taken. Por his services in this connec tion the Mehtar received a grant of Rs. 1,00,000 as a contribution towards the expenses incurred by the State. In the same year the Mehtar of Chitral was granted the title of His Hi ghness and a salute of 11 guns, as personal distinctions. In 1926 the Mehtar agreed (No. Ill), in consideration of an annual subsidy of Rs. 15,000, to take steps for the prevention of charas smug gling through I)ir and Swat into British India. In 1928 an Agreement (No. IV) was concluded with the Mehtar, under which his annual subsidy was increased by Rs. 30,000, and he undertook to supply local produce to the British troops stationed in Chitral. * Paid by the Kashmir Darbar.N.-W.

The Mehtar maintains a force of about 2,500 men, called the ' Body- guard , and an irregular labour corps known as the t£ Sappers and Miners In addition to these forces there are 110 Chitral Levies, armed and paid by Government, and a corps of Chitral Scouts number ing 989 men under two British officers. The scouts are armed by Gov ernment and receive pay for only one month in the year when they are called up for training. 2. DIR. The small State of Dir lies to the south of Chitral. The ruling family are Akhund Khel a branch of the Painda Khel of the Malizai Akozai Yusafzai. The founder of the line was Mulla Tlias, known as Akhund Baba, a holy man who flourished in the^ 17th century; but his giandson, Ghulam Khan, seems to have been the first to acquire tem poral power. Khan Rahmatullah Khan, a collateral of Ghulam Khan, was indebted to the Maharaja of Kashmir for pecuniary assistance which enabled him to assert his authority and he succeeded in obtaining the Chiefship for himself. Rahmatullah Khan acknowledged the obligations due to the Maharaja, and there was for some years a tolerably close connection between Dir and Srinagar. But in 1875, offended at the way in which he was treated by an agent sent by the Darbar to strengthen the connection, the Dir Chief broke off relations with Kashmir: and from that time till Ins death he cannot be said to have acknowledged the Maharaja's suzerainty. Muhammad Sharif Khan succeeded his father Rahmatullah Khan in 1884. Shortly after his succession, he went to war with Aman-ul-Mulk of Chitral, but was completely defeated, and it seemed at one time not improbable that the influence which Aman-ul-Mulk had acquired in Dir might be used to establish more friendly relations between Dir and Kashmir. In 1890, however, Dir was conquered and occupied by TJmra Khan, Chief of the neighbouring State of Jandol, and Muhammad Sharif Khan was obliged to take refuge in Swat. He made several unsuccessful attempts in the succeeding years to regain his country. In 1895, on the advance of the Chitral Relief Expedition, Muhammad Sharif Khan did good service by advancing up the Panjkora line with his own forces, recovering Dir from Umra Khan's garrison, and send ing a force into Chitral territory, which seized the Drosh fort. He also captured and handed over the Chitrali pretender Slier Afzal. 2 F 2418 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—DIR, SWAT AND CHITRAL AGENCY—Dir. At the conclusion of the expedition Muhammad Sharif Khan, now restored to his Khanship, entered into an Agreement (No. V) with the Government of India, by which he undertook to keep open the Chitral road from Chakdarra to Ashret, and in return received an allowance of Rs. 10,000 a year, and a similar sum in consideration of his freeing from tolls the trade between Chakdarra and Ashret. In the spring of 1897 the Khan of Dir annexed to his territories the tribesmen on the right bank of the upper Swat, w T ho had till then been practically independent. In June 1897 the Government of India granted the title of Nawab to Muhammad Sharif Khan. In October 1898 the Nawab arrived at an Agreement (No. VI) with the Khan of Nawagai, defining the boundaries of their respective juris dictions. In December of the same year he executed an Agreement (No. VII) with the Government of India, defining the boundaries of his territories, and undertaking not to interfere with, or commit aggies- sion on, any tribes beyond those boundaries. The engagements made by Muhammad Sharif Khan with Government were on the whole satisfactorily carried out. In the disturbances raised by the ' { Mad ' Faqir in 1897, the bulk of the Dir tribes, except those in the Swat valley, took no part; and, when the Faqir attempted in November-December 1898 to attack the Chitral road, he was repulsed by Dir forces under Abdulla Khan of Eobat. The river sections of the Akozai clan—the Azzi Khel, Tinki Khel, Nikpi Khel, Shamizai and Sebujnis—then executed Agreements (No. VIII) in December 1898 binding themselves to exclude the Faqir and enemies of the Government of India from their limits. In March 1899 Muhammad Sharif Khan's allowance was raised to Rs. 15,000 with effect from the 1st October 1898. The Government of India had, in February 1897, decided that the crest of the Lowarai range was to be regarded as the boundary between Dir and Chitral: and in 1898 an annual payment of Rs. 500 to the Nawab was sanctioned, as a very special concession and act of favour. The Nawab, however, declined the offer; but in 1900 he accepted a pay ment of Rs. 1,000 a year, as compensation for grazing and other rights enjoyed by Dir on the Chitral side of the Dir-Chitral boundary, and signed an Agreement (No. IX). Muhammad Sharif Khan died in December 1904 and, with the sanc tion of the Government of India, w T as succeeded by his eldest son Badshah Khan (Aurangzeb Khan). In 1905 Badshah Khan executed an Agreement (No. X), renewing the aoreement given by his father and submitting to certain new conditions chiefly concerned with the Dir timber trade. The allowances enjoyedN.-W. F. PROVINCE—DTR, SWAT AND CHITRAL AGENCY—Dir. 4x9 by his father, amounting to Us. 2G,000 per annum, were continued to Badshah Khan, who undertook to provide a sum of Es. 5,000 annually, to he retained by Government out of these allowances, for the support of his brother Mian (hil Jan, on condition of the latter living in Peshawar, 01, with the permission of Government, elsewhere out of Dir. Mian Gnl Jan, ho^ever, did not remain long in Peshawar, and bv the follow ing June was back again in Bajaur as the result of promises made by San id Ahmad Khan of Barwa to reinstate him in Jandol. A common distrust of the Khan felt by both brothers led to an agreement between them on the 12th June 1905, by which Mian Gul Jan was to hold Mundah in Jandol and the boundaries of Jandol and Dir were defined. But peace between the brothers was not long preserved. Bv the follow- ing year Mian Gul Jan had placed himself at the head of tribes smart ing under the highhandedness of Badshah Khan, and had seized two his forts. Political action to bring about a settlement led to the signing of an agreement at Chakdarra on the 12th June 1906. The dissensions between Badshah Khan and his brother on the one side and his people on the other were by no means terminated by this but after a truce of six months had been imposed on all parties by the Chief Commissioner, a more lasting agreement was signed in April 1908 by Badshah Khan and all the important persons concerned except Mian Gul Jan and Saiyid Ahmad Khan of Barwa. In June 1908 the title of Nawab was conferred on Badshah Khan as a personal distinction. In 1911 the Nawab attended the King Emperor's Darbar at Delhi i but was not called upon to do homage. Fighting took place between Badshah Khan and his brother in 1911 and again in 1912. Mian Gul Jan died at Jandol in June 1914. Badshah Khan's annual subsidy of Rs. 25,000 was increased to Rs. 50,000 in 1918, when the title of Nawab was made hereditary and the title of Khan Bahadur was conferred on his eldest son Shah Jahan Khan, who was at the same time formally recognised as his heir. The latter years of Badshah Khan's reign were principally spent in an unsuc cessful struggle to extend his possessions on the right bank of the Swat River and to maintain what he already held. Under the leadership of Mian Gul Gul Shahzada the whole of the Swat tribes eventually threw off Badshah Khan's rule and in 1919 Gul Shahzada captured the Adinzai Valley. This he was forced by political pressure in 1922 to relinquish to the Nawab of Dir, and both parties were induced to agree to certain terms laid down by Government as to their future boundaries and mutual relations. These terms were stated in a Murasila issued by the Political Agent, which is known as the Adinzai Agreement (No. XI).42b N - w - PHOVINCE—D1R, SWAT A^l) CHITRAL AGENCY— Dir and Swat. Badsliah Khan died in February 1925: and, after some difficulties with liis brother Alamzeb Khan, the eldest son Shah Jahan Khan was accepted by the leading men of Dir as successor and was accorded formal recognition as Nawab by Government at a Durbar held at riiakdarra in May 1925. A new agreement was drawn up with Nawah Shah Jelian Khan (No. XII). In 1926 and 1930 the Viceroy visited the Dir State. In 1928 the Nawab evicted Alamzeb Khan from the estates mentioned in No. XII on account of disloyalty. During the disturbances which took place in Peshawar District and elsewhere in the year 1930 the Nawab placed his resources at the disposal of Government. In 1930 the Chitral reliefs were for the first time effected without the employment of a supporting column. In December 1930 certain ambiguities latent in clause (4) of the Adinzai Agreement (No. XI) were rectified by the issue of instructions to the Nawab and to the Wali of Swat (No. XHI). These had the effect of confirming existing boundaries and prohibiting hostilities between Dir and Swat in future. The arrangement is personal to the present rulers and conditional on their observing their obligations towards Gov ernment. The area of Dir is about 3,000 square miles; the population about 140,000; and the revenue (including subsidy) about lis. 1,65,000 exclu sive of sales of timber which, though fluctuating greatly, average about lis. 70,000 a year. A great part of the Dir territory is divided into minor Khanates, which are held by relations of the Nawab, or by the heads of the main sections of the Malizai tribe. 3. SWAT. Of the Yusafzai inhabiting the Swat Valley, the most important is the (liar) Ranizai division of the Akozai clan, whose fighting strength is about 6,880. Abdul Ghafur, the Akhund of Swat, was a religious leader of great fame and influence at the time of the annexation of the Punjab, his headquarters being at Saidu in Upper Swat. In December 1849 it became necessary to punish the tribes of Lower Swat for complicity in various raids within the British border, and a force was sent against the villages at the foot of the Shahkot and Morah passes. The operations were completely successful: and the Akhund, recognising the strength of the British power, impressed on the tribes that their only chance of resisting it lay in unity under a single leader. He put forward Saiyid Akbar, a descendant of the famous Pir Baba whose grave in Buner is still one of the holiest shrines in the country, as a candidate. Saiyid Akbar came to be known as the Badshah of Swat.N.-W. F. PROVINCE—Dlk, SWAT AND CH1TRAL AGENCY— Swal, 421 In 1852 a series of outrages was committed by Ajim Khan, the fugitive Khan of the village of Tangi on the Swat River. His chief suppoit was Hie Badshah of Swat, and he was aided and abetted by the fUman Khel and Ranizai. In March 1853 a force from Peshawar destroyed the chief villages of the Utman Khel, though no agreement was taken from them at the time. The force proceeded as far as Dargai and imposed a fine of Rs. 5,000 on the Sam Ranizai, who surrendered thiee of their head men as hostages. These, however, they subsequently 1 epudiated, and the fine remained unpaid. In May 1853 a second force maiclied against the Sam llanizai, who submitted and expressed a wish to become British subjects. This was not acceded to; but they were allowed to re-settle on terms (No. XIV) to which they have since stead fastly adhered. Saiyid Akbar, the Badshah of Swat, died in 1857. The Akhund, and under his influence the leading Ranizai Khans, joined the combination of tribes that took part in the Ambeyla campaign of 1863. The Akhund of Swat died in January 1877. On his death two powerful factions arose, headed by Rahmatullali, Khan of Dir, and the eldest son of the Akhund, known as the Mian Gul. In 1877 the Ranizai village of Skhakot took to harbouring outlaws and otherwise giving trouble, A small force was sent against it, when the terms demanded by Government were at once complied with. The neighbouring villages also gave similar guarantees. In 1878 a small force was despatched to exact reparation for a wanton raid by Iltman Khel on a gang of unarmed coolies working on the Swat canal near Abazai. The tribal leaders came in and submitted to the terms imposed by Government. In 1895, during the march of tlie Chitral Relief Force, the attitude of the IJtman Khel was generally friendly, as was that of the Sam Ranizai and the Khans of the Khan Khel and Ranizai of l^ower Swat. After the conclusion of the Chitral expedition, the Khan Khel section of the Akozai Yusafzai, and the Bar and Sam Ranizai, undertook (No. XV) to protect the road from Peshawar to Chitral running through their limits. The Khans and Khan Khel of Lower Swat also agreed (No. XVI) to abandon their right to tolls in consideration of an annual pay ment of Rs. 10,000. During the disturbances of 1897 the Sam Ranizai acted up to their agreement of 1895, with a few individual exceptions. The Bar Ranizai and the tribes of Tipper and Lower Swat, however, took an active part in them and expeditions were sent into Upper Swat to exact punishment. The Musa Kliel section of Akozai Yusafzai, and other tribes of Upper Swat, in addition to complying with the Government terms, expressed (No. XVII) their unconditional submission.422 N -- w - F - PROVINCE—DIR, SWAT AND CHITRAL AGENCY— Swat. The movable column, which had been located in the Swat Valley since 1895) was withdrawn in 1902. Tn 1907 the Utman Ivhel jirga of Agra gave a written Agreement ^No. XVIII) arranging terms of peace with the Ranizai and undertak ing to protect and be responsible for the safety of Government survey parties. tn 1909 the construction of the Upper Swat Canal was begun, with head works at Amandarra and a tunnel under the Malakand Pass to Dargai, which was completed in 1914. The project was viewed with considerable distrust by the inhabitants of Lower Swat, who feared that the diversion of so much water from the Swat River would decrease their facilities for irrigation. Government therefore agreed to assist the Swat villages below Amandarra in maintaining and developing irriga tion and in making the best use of the water remaining in the Swat River. 1 he Sam Ranizai are now given water from the Canal on payment of water-rate, and their land has become extremely valuable in conse quence. In 1915 the Shamizai and Sebujni sections of the Akozai Yusafzai, in Upper Swat, succeeded in freeing their country from the domination of the Nawab of Dir as far down the right bank of the Swat River as Shamozai. They then called in Saiyid Abdul Jabbar Shah, of Sitana on the Indus, to be their Badshah ' and to lead them against the Nawab of Dir. Ihis effort, however, finally resulted in a collision with •i lintish foice at the Uandaki ridge. The attack was easilv repulsed, and a blockade was established against the whole of Upper Swat, which lasted till the end of 1915, In 191G the two surviving descendants of the Akhund of Swat, Mian (xiil (iiil Shahzada and Mian (lul Shirin Badshah, grandsons of the Akhund Abdul Ghafur, who had been driven out of Swat by Abdul Jabbar Khan, re-established themselves in Saidu: and in September 1917 the Badshah was told that he was no longer required, and letmned to his home on the Indus. Gul Shahzada was soon afterwards recognised by the tribes of Upper Swat as their leader. Shirin Badshah was killed in 1918 in the course of fighting between Swat and f)ii, which continued sporadically until 1922, when an agreement was reached between the Nawab of Dir and the Mian Gul Gul Shahzada. The terms oi this agreement are given in No. XI. It was amended in 1930 (No. XIII) (&gt;See under ' 2. Dir '). The next four years were occupied by C tii I Shahzada in consolidating his position : and in Mav 1926, o\\ ing to his effective establishment of his rule over the whole of Upper Swat, the Government of India decided to recognise him as tuler or ^Vali of Swat, to conclude with him an Agreement (No. XIX) of mutual friendship, and to grant him an annual subsidy ofN.-W. F. PROVINCE—DIR, SWAT AND CttlTRAL AGENCY— Swat and 423 Buner. Rs. 10,000. All dealings with the tribes of Upper Swat are now con ducted through the Wali. In December 1926 an Agreement (No. XX) was taken from the Khan Khel and other jirgas of Lower Swat, under which no outlaws will in future be permitted to reside in any part of the protected area of Malakand. In 1927, in consideration of an annual payment of Rs. 500, the Wali of Swat surrendered the rights theretofore exercised by him in the Pitao-Soria Malandri area. No written agreement was taken on this occasion. This area is now included within the administrative border. In April 1930 the Viceroy visited the Wali of Swat at Saidu and invested him with the insignia of Iv. B. E., which had been granted on the 1st January 1930. During the disturbances which took place in the Peshawar District and elsewhere in the year 1930 the Wali of Swat placed his resources at the disposal of Government. 4. BUNER. The inhabitants of Buner belong to the Iliaszai and Malizai clans of the Yusafzai, collectively known as the Bunerwals. Their fighting strength is about 10,000. Mir Saiyid Ahmad Shah of Bareilly, the Wahhabi founder of the colony of Hindustani Fanatics, was killed by the Sikhs in 1831. His followers settled at Sitana on the Indus, but were expelled in 1858 and moved to Malka in Buner. As the peace of the border had for some years been disturbed by their fanatical operations, it became necessary to eject them; and in October 1863 a force moved up the Ambeyla Pass with that object. A temporary check gave time for the tribes to collect, and contingents from Swat, Dir and Bajaur came to the assistance of the Bunerwals. Severe fighting ensued; but in December 1863 all opposi tion was overcome, and the Bunerwals agreed (No. XXI) to disband their force, destroy Malka, and expel the Hindustani Fanatics from Buner. In 1868 the Salarzai division of the Iliaszai Yusafzai burned a village in British Yusafzai, and were blockaded until they agreed to rebuild the village and pay a fine. In 1877 a border raid by the Bunerwals led to the imposition of a blockade and the exaction of a fine. In 1884 a series of raids by the Salarzai and Ashuzai divisions of the Iliaszai, and the Nurzai division of the Malizai, led to all three clans being blockaded : and it was not until February 1887 that the Bunerwals Bubmitted and complied with the terms imposed by Government.±24: N - w F - PROVINCE—L)IR, SWAT AND CHITRAL AGENCY— Buner and Bajaur. In July 1&lt;S97 the liunerwals took part in the attaek on Malakand and Chakdana. 1 hey refused to come m and answer for their conduct, so an expeditionary force was despatched against them in January 1898. The clans submitted practically without resistance, and the whole of Buner proper was examined and surveyed. Their prestige as a fighting clan, which had stood high since the Ambeyla campaign, has in conse quence much diminished. Two serious raids committed by the Bunerwals in 1913-14 were punished by a force which entered their country by the Malandri Pass and imposed a fine of lis. 7,000, which was paid in full. In August and September 1915 the tribe, assisted by detachments of the Chagarzai and by the colony of Hindustani Fanatics, were several times-engaged by British troops: a blockade was enforced, which was not raised until July 191G, when the Bunerwals paid a fine of Rs. 8,000. In 1924 the Wali of Swat established his rule over Buner, though he has not yet been formally recognised as its ruler. Since his occupa tion of the country the conduct of the Bunerwals has been exem- plary. The A\ ali has imposed customs duties on goods exported from Buner by the various passes leading into the Mardan Sub-Division, and has done something to improve communications in Buner and Chamla. A road has also been made by him over the Malandri Pass 'as far as the boundary of Bahroch village, lie has taken consistently efiective measures to prevent raids into the Peshawar District and has on more than one occasion handed up absconding criminals for trial in the regular courts. He and his local officials in Buner have at all times shown their readiness to co-operate with the British officials at Mardan for the preservation of the peace of the border and, during 1926, a traversing survey of the whole of Buner and Chamla was carried out by the Imperial Survey Department under tribal escorts provided bv the Wali. The border between Buner and British territorv was revised in 1927 to include the Malandri and Wara Dara tract and the administration of the latter area was assumed by the Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar. Proprietary title in the Malandri area was bitterly disputed between the Kumari Khel and Hamza Khel sections of Buner. An influential jirga was appointed to go into the whole matter and their finding regard ing Pitao Malandri was accepted by the Chief Commissioner and the Tillage was allowed to remain with the Kumari Khel. The ownership of Soria Malandri still awaits decision. An original settlement of the tract will be undertaken as soon as the question of title is finally deter mined. 5. BAJAUR. The Bajauris, or Tarkanns, sent a contingent under their Chief, Faiz Talab Khan, to the assistance of the Bunerwals in the Ambeyla cam-1 % N.-W. F.

In 1895 Umra Khan of Jandol, grandson of Faiz Talab KJian, who had at that time made himself master of a considerable poition of Swat, the greater part of Bajanr and the whole of Dir, was the moving spirit in the siege of Chitral, and also sent a large contin gent of Bajanris to oppose the Chitral Relief Force at Chakdarra. In April of that year, two brigades of the Force advanced into the Jandol Valley, but Umra Khan tied into Afghan territory. Consequent on the rising of 189T, two brigades were despatched tinough Rajaur against thfe Mohmands, the Bajauri Khans of Nawagai, Khar and Jhar promising them unrestricted passage. One of these brigades was attacked at Nawagai, and the other in the Watalai Valley, \\lieie se\ ere fighting ensued, and it became necessary to send a punitive force against the Maniund and Salarzai clans of the Tarkanris. In October the Mamund Jirgas came in and made full submission, and the Salarzai complied in full with the terms imposed. For their assistance rendered during the occupation of Bajaur, Government granted Es. 10,000 to the Khan of Nawagai, Es. 3,500 to the Khau of Khar, and Ks. 2,500 to the Khan of Jhar. In August 1915 the Salarzai, in concert with the Shamozai Iltman Khel, attacked the Dir Levy post at the Panjkora Bridge and a blockade was imposed upon Bajaur which remained in force till the end of the year. The Khan of Nawagai, who had received from Government the title of Nawab and a yearly subsidy of lis. 10,000, allowed his own relatives to go down with tribal lashkars and attack British troops at Shabkad r. For this conduct he was deprived of his title and subsidy. In 1917 the Nawab of Uir conquered the greater part of the Jandol Valley and added it to the Dir State. In April 1925 the Nawab of Dir and his brother Alamzeb Khan signed a formal Agreement {see No. XII, Annexure A), under which Alamzeb Khan was put in possession of Jandol under the suzerainty of the Nawab: he was evicted from these possessions in 1928 {see under '2. Dir '). The agitation in Peshawar in 1930 spread to the Bajaur and Utman Khel tribes who in May sent a lashkar estimated at 1,200 to Jindai Khwar. A few days' bombing of their villages brought about their speedy retirement. The Hindustani Fanatics, whose headquarters are at Samasta, in Mad da Khel country {see Part I), also have a colony at Chamarkand in Bajaur. 6. KOHISTAN. The Bashkaris of Panjkora Kohistan at one time paid tribute to Chitral, and afterwards to both Chitral and Dir. They iiow r pay tribute to Dir only.

PROVINCE—DIE, SWAT AND CHITHAL AGENOY— Kohistan. the sale of this timber, which is floated down the Panjkora river, is a source of considerable revenue to the Nawab of Dir. The agreement of May 1925 with the Nawab (see No. XII) includes a special Article regard- iner the Dir timber trade. Swat Kohistan also possesses rich deodar forests, over which the neighbouring states desired to obtain possession : and in 1923 Govern ment warned the Rulers of Chitral, Dir and Swat that interference in this tract would not be permitted. The inhabitants, estimated in 192G to number 20,000, are Torwal and Garwi, non-Pathan races of whom little is known : they appear to be remnants of the races who occupied both Lower and Upper Swat before the arrival of the Yusafzai. In 1927 a representative jirga of the Garwi tract visited Peshawar and submitted a petition making certain requests, which were eventually embodied in an Agreement (No. XXII) concluded in 1928. In the same year a Forest Officer visited the Kohistan forests and prepared a report. In March 1929 the tribe concluded an agreement with Messrs. Spedding, Dinga Singh and Co. for the working of their forests and during the summer a Political Tahsildar was sent to maintain the neces sary liaison between the tribe, the firm and the Forest staff. The work proceeded fairly smoothly during 1929, but in 1930 considerable trouble was experienced owing to local jealousies and other causes.N.-W. F.

Now by means of this document (Murasila) I beg to submit in detail, the result of the discussion and the conclusions arrived at:— (1) I am prepared fully to comply with the terms of the deed of gift executed by my late father, in connection with my younger brother, Bakht Jehan Zeb, and will abide by the written Will of my father, dated 7th of Shaban, 1341 Hijri, in which the lands acquired by purchase and situated in Landali and other villages were given to my said brother and his mother Khunza Bibi of Chitral. Further as an act of grace and out of affection (for my brother) besides the lands purchased in Landai, etc., I also give to him the remaining mort gaged and unmortgaged lands situated in the said Landai which were at his death, in possession of and under the control of, my late father the Nawab of Dir, Swat and Jandul. I grant to my said brother these lands for his maintenance. 1 also promise that I will myself settle any existing disputes about the mort gaged and unmortgaged lands in question with the Khans of Landai and Ranai. My said brother, or his mother will not be called upon to settle these disputes. I further promise that I will not in any way interfere with the property above- mentioned so long as my said brother and his mother are loyal to me and do not in any way side with my enemies and ill-wishers. As a further act of grace I promise provided my said brother goes to an ac knowledged college or school in British territory for competent education, to pay him a sum of Rs. 50 per mensem until he attains the age of 21 years. This allowance will be paid only if my brother is educated in an acknowledged Government college or school beyond the limits of Dir, Swat or Chitral.

F ree translation of a settlement between the J irgas of the D ir S tate and of S wat , dated the 14th April 1925. 1. In clause 8 of the Murasila dated 2()th June 1922 from Colonel Ramsay, Political Agent, Dir, Swat and Chitral, to the address of the Mian Gul of Swat certain words are not clear and in consequence thereof disputes have arisen between the Mian Gul and Khan Bahadur Shah Jehan Khan, Waliahad of Dir State, about the meaning of the words. The point at issue is as to whether the words ' Kar-wa-Begar ' (forced labour) is or is not included in the words ' Dakhal-wa- Charaz (should not interfere). To settle this point the Mian Gul and Khan Bahadur Shah Jehan Khan have appointed the following persons as a Council of Elders (' Jirga '); Akhundzada Hazrat Said, Akhundzada Muhammad Zarin, and Ganari Jan, on behalf of Khan Bahadur Shah Jehan Khan, and Malik Kamran, and Mian Abdul Ghafur alias Kasmai Mian on behalf of the Mian Gul. An agreement has been reached to the following effect;— We Akhundzada Muhammad Zarin Khan, Akhundzada Hazrat Said and Ganari Jan Jirga of Dir State on behalf of Khan Bahadur Shah Jehan Khan, Waliahad of Dir State and Mian Abdul Ghafur alias Kasmai Mian and Malik Kamran of Shamozai on behalt of the Mian Gul of Swat, after a full discussion in the presence of the Political Agent, have decided that Khan Bahadur Shah Jehan Khan of Dir State shall not exact forced labour (' Kar-wa-Begar ') from the Estates ( Seris ) of the Mian Gul situated in the Adinzai, Khadikzai and Abazai tracts, i.e., the tenants (' Muzarghans and Faqirs ') of the Mian Gul on these religious grants of land ( Seris ) as indicated shall be exempt from all demands by the Dir State for forced labour (' Kar-wa-Begar '). In all other matters connected with the administration the above-mentioned tenants ( Faqirs and Muzarghans ) will be subject to the orders and under the ^ontrol of the Dir State officials. 1 his concession has, however, been made to the Mian Gul on the clear condition that the tenants in question are loyal to the Dir State and are not permitted to engage in any propaganda inimical to that State.N.-W. F. PROVINCE—Dili, SWAT AND CHITRAL A G EN CY J)ir— 4^5 NO. XII—1925. If the Political Agent is satisfied that the Mian Gul is using the tenants in question for purposes of improper propaganda against the Dir State, or is encourag ing them to be disloyal then the Ruler of the Dir State will be entitled to withdraw from the Mian Gul the said concessions. 2. If any logs belonging to the Mian Gul are stranded on the right bank of the river situated in the Dir State, then the Mian Gul has the right to refloat them down the river by the aid of his servants or contractors, but he is not entitled to open a depot or timber-stack of any description on the right (river) bank within the Dir State. The Ruler of the Dir State will not be responsible in any way, for the protection of logs which are stranded. The contractor will make his own arrangements to guard such timber on the river bank. 3. The Dir State will levy no tax or toll on ghee, grain and other trade com modities belonging to the Mian Gul which pass through Dir limits. 4. The Dir representatives are not prepared to accept the modification suggested by the Mian Gul in clauses 4 and 5 of the letter dated 20th June 1922 (written by Colonel Ramsay). On the other hand the members appointed by the Mian Gul consider that such modification should be made. Nothing, therefore, has been settled between the parties on this point. I Ith April 192'). P.S.

The experience gained during the last four years of the advantages that have accrued to all parties from a state of peace, which advantages would be greatly increased if the prospects of peace being made durable could be assured, has convinced the Government of India that between the neighbouring States of Dir and Swat hostilities are contrary to the real interests of both, and con sequently to the interests of the Government of India who are equally concerned in the welfare of both. Provided therefore that both the present rulers of those States, viz., Khan Bahadur Shah Jehan Khan, Nawab of Dir, and Mian Gul Gulshahzada Sir Abdul Wadud Khan, K.B.E., Wali of Swat, continue loyally to observe their respective engagements with Government, Government will not tolerate the initiation by either party of hostilities against the other and will view with the gravest disapproval any indication that either ruler is engaging in or instigating any intrigue in territory lying beyond his own existing boundaries.

Later on lie succeeded in securing some support from the local Pathans and with their aid was for several years successful m his struggles with the Barakzai Sardars. But in 1829 a general insurrection, produced by his oppressive exactions, took place among the Pathans. Many of his followers were massacred, and he was compelled to flee to Hazara. His followers however again iallied lound him there. In 18'iO Raja Slier Singh, heir-apparent of Ran jit Singh, marched with a large army against the Saiyid and his followers and completely defeated them. The Saiyid fell in the action and some of his followers found their way to Sitana, a villag'e belonging to Sai\id Akbar Shah, who had served Saiyid Ahmad in the capacitv of treasurer and counsellor. After the annexation of Peshawar the Akhund of Swat induced the people of that valley to receive Saiyid Akbar Shah as their temporal ruler. Saiyid Akbar Shah died in 1857. Though the Hindustani Fanatics were known to have aided the Kassanzai in an attack made by them in 1852 on the territory of the Nawab of Amb, no actual collision took place with them till April 1858, when, in order to punish them for an attack on the camp of a British officer near the border, a force of British and Indian troops, 5,000 strong, under Sir Sydney Cotton, was despatched against them. The Utmanzai of Kabal and Kaya gave every assistance to this force in its operations, during the course of which the buildings at Sitana and also at Panjtar, Chinglai and Mangal Thana, where the fanatics had been invited by Mukarrab Khan, son of Fateh Khan of Panjtar, were destroyed, and theN.- W. F. PROVINCE—PESHAWAR DISTRICT—Fusa/zai. 455 Hmdustems were expelled from Sitana. They subsequently re-settled at Malka m the territory of the Amazai, a section of the Utmanzai divi sion of the Yusafzai, on the north-western slopes of Mahaban, and in the eai j pait of 1861 occupied Suri in the vicinity of Sitana and resumed their former depredations on British territory. It therefore became necessary to take steps against them, and the Utmanzai who had per mitted the Fanatics to re-settle and to pass through their country when pioceeding lo and returning from British territory were blockaded. Soon after the institution of the blockade the Utmanzai expressed their willingness to submit to any terms demanded of them- and after some time they agreed (see Part 1, No. IV) to pay a fine of Es. 1,000, to c ose their country against the Sitana Fanatics and other robbers, and to cease from levying certain oppressive dues from traders proceeding up and down the Indus. ♦ Shortly after the settlement with the Utmanzai, the Hindustani Fanatics, however, again returned to Malka, and in the Ambeyla cam paign of 1863 troops were despatched under Sir Neville Chamberlain to drive them out of that place. The Fanatics were joined by the Amazai and the Bunerwal in their opposition to the advance of this force. The Amazai, after a show of resistence, were pacified by the Buner chiefs and joined them in burning Malka. In January 1864 both the Amazai and the Bunerwal executed Agreements {see Part I, No. VII and Part II, No. XXI) to exclude the Hindustanis altogether from their limits. The Amazai kept their agreement till 1893, when Maulvi Abduila, the leader of the colony, again entered into negotiations, as the result of which the colony was allowed to re-settle in the Mubarak Khel Amazai territory. In the altered circumstances no notice wap taken of the colony's re settlement, but the Amazai were from time to time given to understand clearly that they were responsible for the behaviour of the colony. In 1898, at the time of the Buner expedition, the colony moved for safety from Nagri, their headquarters in Mubarak Xhel Amazai territory, to Batara. After the expedition they returned to Mubarak Khel country, and the Amazai were again informed that if they gave shelter to the colony, they would be absolutely responsible for their behaviour. In 1875 the Chagarzai section of the Malizai, a sub-division of the Yusafzai, was implicated in the Akazai and Hassanzai raids on the Agror border (see Part I, Hazara District). In 18(7 a border raid by the Bunerwal led to the imposition of a blockade and the exaction of a fine. Ajab Khan, a leading Chief, who was instrumental in inciting these tribes in order to injure his enemies and enhance his importance in the eyes of Government, was arrested and tried at Peshawar as a common criminal and was executed in June 1878.456 tt.-W.

In 1884 a series of raids by the Bimerwal—the Salarzai aud Ashuzai sections of tbe Iliaszai and the Nurzai section of the Malizai—led to a blockade of all three sections; and it was not until February 1887 that they submitted aud complied with the terms imposed by Government. In July 1897 the Bunerwal took part in the attack upon Malakand and Chakdarra. They refused to come in and answer for their conduct; so an expeditionary force was despatched against them in January 1898. They submitted without resistance. The Khudn Khel and Chamlawal form part of the Mandanr tribe of the Yusafzai. The Khudu Khel, who live south of Buner, are a sub division of the Saddozai division of the Utmanzai clan of Mandanr Yusafzai; and the Chamlawal, who inhabit the Chamla Valley south east of Buner, are a mixture of various Mandanr clans. Both the Khudu Khel and Chamlawal joined in the outbreak of 1897, and in November of that year were called upon to tender their submission. The Khudu Khel promptly complied and paid the fines imposed; but the Chamlawal remained recalcitrant and did not finally comply with the terms of Government until forced to do so, in January 1898, as a result of the operations of the Buner Field Force. In 1912 a strip of land in tribal limits was leased from the Khudu Khel for the Upper Swat Canal, as it offered an alignment more suitable and cheaper than the alternative alignment in British territory. The conduct of the Khudu Khel was marred by a fruitless raid at Zarobi, in the Swabi Tahsil, on the 5th February 1914. No damage was done and one raider was captured. A baramta was sanctioned; the tribe paid a fine of Rs. 2,000, and the houses of some of the raiders concerned were burnt. A portion of the Khudu Khel country, which was proposed to be irrigated by the Upper Swat Canal, was rectangulated in 1921. In February 1922 the Khudu Khel villages of Dagi, Totali and Naugram were visited by a party of Frontier Constabulary under Mr. E. C. Ilandyside; some cattle were seized and hostages brought in. In addition some murderers and malefactors were arrested at Naugram and brought in for trial. The Khudu Khel were implicated in a raid committed in November 1924 at village Kalabat, in which two persons were wounded. Eleven Khudu Khel were seized in baramta and the case was settled. 2.

During the Ambeyla campaign of 18G3 their misbehaviour in cutting otf stragglers from the British columns was punished by the infliction of a fine of Es. 2,500. The adjustment of the shares in which this fine was to be borne by the different villages led to serious internal disturbances: and in 18G6 a force was despatched against them. Their villages were destroyed and rebuilt on the plain, where they were no longer difficult of access. They again gave trouble in 1872, in connection with revenue settlement operations. Troops were sent out, and the recusant villages made submission. In 1897 a number of Utman Khel British subjects secretly joined the Fanatics in Swat. Some individuals were punished; but no villages were openly committed to hostility, (6) Trans-border. The section of this tribe under the political control of the Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar, is the Butkor (or But Khel) section, and the territories occupied by it are Ambahar, the Salala Hills, and the country south of Salala bordering on the district and known generally as Laman TJtman Khel. In November 1908, as a result of raids committed by the Ambahar TJtman Khel, a blockade was instituted. Their jirga came in, in January 1909, paid all the fines imposed, and undertook (JsTo, I) to behave well in future. In 1911 the Laman IJtman Khel were fined for violating British territory in prosecution of their inter-tribal feuds. In 1913 they were placed under blockade for a serious raid committed in TJtmanzai. The Ambahar ITtman Khel also committed several raids in the Peshawar district in 1913, in consequence of which a blockade was en forced. This continued until 1918, when the Ambahar Utman Khel jirga came to Peshawar, paid a fine of Rs. 3,000, and gave security for their future good behaviour. During the settlement operations of 1924 the Laman Utman Khel at first opposed the survey of the Darwazgai salient; but subsequently the survey was carried out without further trouble. In June 1930 an Utman Khel lashkar, mainly composed of the But kor and Asil sections, numbering some 2,000, crossed the Abazai river and occupied the bank of the Jindai Khwar above Palai. They were engaged by Scouts and regular troops and were dispersed, suffering 20 casualties and losing 23 prisoners. In July 1930 the Alingar Faqii succeeded in raising a lashkar of some 2,000 Mamunds from Bajaur, but as the Laman Utman Khel refused to give them a passage through their villages, the lashkar dispersed. The Butkor Utman Khel jirga was interviewed in August 1930, and, as their attitude was friendly, their captives were released, but the captured arms were forfeited.HBBHMHCT .247 'ii' tfti ■ N.-W. F.

During the year 1929 a Government primary school was opened at Malkakadi in Gadun country. In September 1929 Captain Hay, Joint Deputy Commissioner, Mardan, accompanied by Squadron Leader de Crespigny, M.C., D.F.C., U.A.K, visited the Mahaban hill in Gadun country and at the invitation of the Wali of Swat returned through Sori Amazai and Chamla, 4. MOHMANDS. Ihe Mohmands are a large tribe, occupying the hilly country on the north-west border of the Peshawar valley. They originally owned allegiance to the Amir of Kabul, from whom their Chiefs received cash allowances and the revenue of certain districts in the direction of Jalala bad, amounting to about Rs. 70,000 a year. The tribe can turn out about 20,000 fighting men, and is divided into four main clans—the Baizai, Khwaezai, Tarakzai and Halimzai. Owing to the direct influence exercised by the Amir Dost Muhammad over the Mohmands, it was chiefly through this tribe that he endeavoured, after the annexa tion of the Punjab, to harass the British border. The Chief, Saadat Khan of Lalpura, was also hostile to the British because, during their brief connection with the affairs of Afghanistan in 1841, he had been superseded in the Chiefship by his cousin Torabaz Khan, who was, how ever, unable to maintain his ground after the British had left the coun try. The tribe possessed peculiar facilities for causing annoyance as two of the roads leading to Afghanistan pass through their territories. Ihe principal clans with which Government have had dealings are the Tarakzai, whose most important Chief is the Khan of Lalpura: the Burhan Khel and Isa Khel, of Pandiali, who were originally branches of the Tarakzai but are now quite distinct: and the Halimzai, of Gandab and Kamali. These clans all border on British territory and were in the enjoyment of certain villages within the Peshawar district of the collective value of Rs. 10,000 a year, thus owning joint allegiance to the British Government and to the Amir of Kabul. In 1850 and 1851 their raids and robberies were frequent: and in October 1851 a force was sent against the Tarakzai and Halimzai. It was opposed by the whole tribe, under Saadat Khan, and operations continued for three months, severe punishment being inflicted. After the withdrawal of the force, the whole tribe again combined against the British; but in April 1852 they were completely routed. The Halimzai, under their Malik Ahmad Sher, at once tendered their submission and entered into an Agreement (No. V). 1 hey w eie allowed to re-settle on payment of an annual tribute of Us. 200, and on condition of loyalty and good service. To these terms■MMMMHUi N.-W. F. PROVINCE—PESHAWAR DISTRICT— Mohmands. they have steadfastly adhered, and in 1857 they were so useful to the local authorities that Ahmad Sher received an annual grant in acknow ledgment of their services. The Tarakzai did not at once submit, but eventually did so and were allowed to re-settle on payment of an annual tribute of Es. 600. Soon afterwards, however, they again began to give trouble, and finally the greater portion of them left their villages in British territory and went to their hills in August 1854. A force was despatched against them which inflicted severe punishment, and they submitted unconditionally. Those who had thrown off their allegiance were only allowed to re-settle on payment of the revenue assessed upon their lands, while those who had remained loyal continued as before to hold their lands rent-free on payment of their share of the tribute. No written agreements we're entered into, but these arrangements were successful. The Tarakzai Mohmands hold a tribal jagir of their lands in British territory amounting to Rs. 11,300. The Pandiali Mohmands long continued recalcitrant; but finally, in November 1860, their Chief Nawab Khan submitted unconditionally and was pardoned, on making restitution to British subjects for stolen pro perty and paying compensation for other injuries caused by his clan. In 1888 the Burhan Khel gave some trouble in consequence of a dispute regarding their tribal allowance with Pirdost Khan, son of ISawab Khan. The shares of each were fixed and the Burhan Khel paid a fine. In 1863, at the time of 'the Ambeyla campaign, emissaries of the Akhund of Swat succeeded in inciting the Mohmands of the Peshawar valley to attack British territory. Two Mohmand lashkars, one under Sultan Muhammad Khan, son of Saadat Khan, and the other (in January 1864) under Nauroz Khan, also a son of Saadat Khan, were met and defeated near Shabkadr. For his share in these acts of aggression, Saadat Khan was removed by the Amir of Kabul from his chiefship of Lalpura and, with his son Nauroz Khan, was deported to Kabul. He was subsequently released, but died soon afterwards. In 1871 Sultan Muhammad Khan, who was then Chief of Lalpura, was assassinated, and was succeeded by his brother Nauroz Khan. In 1873 the Hafiz Kor sub-section of the Tarakzai were prohibited from entering British terri tory for three years, and their lands were confiscated, for having fired at the Commandant of Shabkadr. Bahrain Khan, half-brother of Nauroz Khan, caused the murder of Major Macdonald, Commandant of the fort of Michni, in 1873. For his negligence in allowing the murderer to escape Nauroz Khan was removed from the Chiefship by the Amir, but was afterwards restored, only to be deprived of it again in 1875, when he was replaced by Muhammad Shah Khan, son of Sultan Muhammad Khan. IN.-W. F. PROVINCE—PESHAWAjR DISTRICT — Mohmands. 461 're-stfl illj, i In! In April 1879 Muhammad Sadik Khan, the eldest son of Nauroz Khan, joined the Amir Takub Khan. As soon as the British troops left Dakka in 1879 the Amir appointed Muhammad Sadik Khan as Khan of Lalpura in the place of Muhammad Shah Khan. He was acknow ledged as Khan by the Government of India at the end of 1879. But in January 1880 he threatened Dakka and the Landi Kotal road with a large following, which was routed by a British force. Negotiations were then opened with Sadik Khan's half-brother Akbar Khan. Eventually a Sanad (ISTo. YI) was granted to Akbar Khan, conferring upon him the Chiefship of lialpura and all the jagirs and allowances appertaining thereto, subject to the condition of his loyalty and good service to the British Grovernment. Later on, the Amir Abdur Rahman Khan was informed that Akbar had been appointed Khan of Lalpura by the British Grovernment, and that the Khanship of Lalpura was under British protection. At the end of 1880 Akbar Khan was confirmed in the Khanship by the Amir. ITnder the Durand Agreement of 1894 the eastern Mohmand clans, comprising the Tarakzai, Halimzai of Gandab and Kamali, Burhan Khel and Isa Khel, and the affiliated clans of Dawezai and Utmanzai, fell on the British side of the border. These clans are known as the ' Assured Clans '—those to which the British Government have given assurances that they should not lose or suffer from the severance of their ancient connection with the Afghan State. In 1896 the jirgas of these clans formally tendered their submission to the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, and were granted the following allowances to replace those which they formerly received from Kabul and Lalpura:—Halimzai of Gandab Rs. 8,480, Halimzai of Kamali Rs. 2,800, Dawezai Rs. 1,200, TTtmanzai Rs. 720, Tarakzai Rs. 3,600; while the allowance of Rs. 1,000, already enjoyed by the Isa Khel and Burhan Khel, was raised to Rs. 1,325, The Mohmands were implicated in the general frontier rising of 1897, in the course of which they looted and burned the village of Shankargarh and attacked the adjoining fort of Shabkadr. A force was despatched against them in September, inflicting severe punishment: and, in addi tion to the confiscation of a number of rifles and guns, a fine of Rs. 19,094 was realised from the sections concerned. In 1902 an allowance of Rs. 2,250, and Rs. 1,125 for lungis to repre sentative Maliks, was sanctioned for the Musa Khel of Mitai, a section of the Baizai clan, who executed an Agreement (ISTo. VII). In 1904 the Tarakzai received an addition of Rs. 1,000 a year to their allowances in consideration of their protecting the head works of the Kabul River Canal (No. VIII). In 1905 they undertook full responsibility for the protection of the Kabul River Railway from all attacks from the left bank of the Kabult62 N.-W. F. PROVJ NOE—PESHAWAll DISTRICT— Mohmands. River, in return for which they received un increase of Tls. 5,000 a year to their allowances (No. TX). In April 1908 two separate attacks on British territory were made by Mohmand lashkars. Severe punishment was inflicted by a force whicli enieied (heir country in May: and the Mohmand allowances up to the 31st May 1908, except those due to the Tarakzai, were declared forfeit. The Gandab and Kamali Halimzai, the Tsa Khel, the Burhan Khel and the Khwaezai—the four clans who control the routes leading into British territory from Mohmand country—announced in open jirga on the 30th May 1908 their determination to forbid passage to thieves or raiders from the Baizai. The work on the Kabul River Railway was discontinued in 1909, but the payment of the additional allowance of Rs. 5,000 per annum was continued to the Tarakzai. InFebiuarv 1909 the following additional allowances were sanc tioned : Rs. Pandiali clans ... 4 800 Mnsa Khel of Mitai ...... 4 000 Dawezai 1,500 Utmanzai ....... 600 In December 1913 the Mitai Musa Khel came in for their allowances after a lapse of ten years and were paid for three years in arrears. During 1915 three attacks on British territory were made fby the Mohmands: the first in April, by a lashkar of about 4,000 Khwaezai and TTsman Khel Baizai, the remaining clans holding aloof: the second in September, by a lashkar of 18,000 to 20,000 Baizai and others: and the third—a very half-hearted affair—in October by a lashkar of about 9,000. All these attacks were defeated with severe loss: resulting, in each case, 111 the immediate dispersal of the lashkar. A period of comparative quiescence followed, disturbed only by the activities of various gangs of laiders, which culminated, in January 1916, in a determined attack on Shabkadr fort by a gang of about 200 men of the Koda Khel section of the Baizai. As a result of these offences, a blockade of the Upper Mohmand clans was ordered. In April 1916, they accepted the prescribed terms and the blockade was removed. Fines to a total of Rs. 30.000 were imposed and lealised from the tribesmen concerned, and security in bonds of Rs. 10,000 each were taken from all sections of the Upper Mohmands for their good behaviour for two years. In September 1916 the jirgas of the Tarakzai, Halimzai, Isa Khel and Burhan Khel were interviewed by the Chief Commissioner, North- West Frontier Province, to whom they presented a petition for the res- toration of their allowances which had been suspended as the result of the lecent turbulent conduct of the Mohmand tribe as a whole. ThisN.-W. F. PROVINCE-PESHAWAR DISTRICT-J/o). m a«d s . 46 3 was rejected : extensive raiding ensued, chiefly by the Halimzai and J andiali clans: and, after punishment had been inflicted on certain iarakzai vi lages on and near the border, a strict blockade was instituted, including the provision of a barbed wire fence containing a live wire, and the erection of block-houses. In November 191C a lashkar of 6,000 men attacked the defences, but was repulsed with loss: and in July 1917 ie Molimand jirgas came in and accepted the terms imposed (No. X), 'Wiiereupon the blockade was raised. Early m 1919, at the time of the Punjab disturbances and when war with Afghanistan was imminent, some mnllas, accompanied by a detachment of the Amir's troops, came through Mohmand country as tar as Gandab and invited the tribe to rise against the British; but, under the leadership of Malik Ahmad Nur, Musa Khel, and Malik Anmir, (randab Hahmzai, they refused to send a lashkar until they had inter viewed the Afghan General. On this the mullas held a conference, as a result of which the Amir's troops received orders to retire and the mull as dispersed. The Mohmand ,jirgas then hastened to Shabkadr, where they were seen by the Chief Commissioner and their allowances, suspended since the outbreak of tribal disturbances in 1915, were restored to them as reward for the services rendered by them on this occasion. In November 1919 jirgas of Tarakzai, Isa Khel, Burhan Khel and Halimzai were interviewed at Shabkadr, and allowances were distribut. ed to these sections without incident. During 1921 three years' allowances were paid to the Musa Khel of Mitai. . In ' Time 1924 demarcation of the Mohmand border, in connection with the settlement operations in progress in the Peshawar District, caused the resurrection of the ancient claim of the Burhan Khel to pro prietory rights in some of the Matta lands: and a gang of the Burhan Khel drove off a number of cattle. The Burhan Khel jirga was sum moned to Shabkadr, a fine of Es. 1,000 was realized and all the cattle were recovered. In 1924, during the Mangal rebellion in Afghanistan, a Mohmand lashkar, which included some contingents of the assured clans, assisted the King of Afghanistan in the suppression of the rebellion. For their participation in these operations the allowances of the Utmanzai were withheld in November 1924; but, on their renewed professions of good will towards the British Government, they were permitted to receive their allowance for the half year ending the 30th September .1925, the two preceding half yearly allowances being forfeited. In 1927 there was considerable unrest among the Mohmands, chiefly due to the machinations of the Haji of Turangzai, a notorious firebrand who^ had been responsible for several of the earlier attacks on British territory. This culminated, in June 1927, in an attack on the block house line by a lashkar of about 1,500 men, mainly drawn from the Usman ^ 21464 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—PESHAWAR DISTRICT— Mohmands. Kliel Baizai, with, contingents from the Tarakzai of Lalpura, the Khwaezai, and the Safis (q.v., infra). The defence of the block-house line was entrusted to friendly sections of the Mohmands, supported hy a small British force at Shabkadr. The attack was repulsed, and the defeated lashkar was bombed by the Royal Air Force: the general result being a serious loss of prestige to the Haji of Turangzai and a consider able impression made on the tribes by this demonstration of the ability of aeroplanes to inflict punishment with impunity. The Musa Kb el of Mitai, the most powerful of the assured clans, had refused to join in the attack and had done their best to break up the lashkar. The Government of India decided, by securing a more effective control over this clan, to strike a blow at the influence of the Haji of Turangzai, against whose activities it constituted the best bulwark; and they offered to raise their allowances by Es. 5,000 a year. The offer was accepted : and in December 1927 the Musa Khel entered into a renewed and more extensive Engagement (No. XI) to maintain friendly relations with the Government of India. The allowances of the Mohmand assured clans now amount to Rs. 50,323 per annum. J he disorder in eastern Afghanistan following on the Shinwari rebel lion during 1928 caused some excitement among the Mohmands on the British side of the Durand Line. These tribes, though anxious to assist their fellow tribesmen across the border against the Shinwaris, loyally identified themselves with the British Government's policy of neutrality and abstained from active intervention. During the brief reign of Bacha-i-Saqao at Kabul they were subjected to great pressure from their kinsmen in Afghanistan to join in the struggle which centred round the collection of Afghan tolls on the Khyber-Dakka route. The Shinwaris had appropriated these tolls, which the Mohmands regarded as their hereditary right, and it was by no means easy to persuade them to resist the combined appeal to their tribal feeling and to their cupidity. How ever, ihe Maliks of all sections including the Mitai Musa Khel controlled their young men with great success and the eventual accession of King Nadir Shah removed the chief incentive to interfere in Afghan affairs. In April 19-30 a hostile lashkar of Usman Khel Baizai Mohmands and Safis (q.v.) under the leadership of the Haji of Turangzai came down to the border of the Peshaw T ar District. It was made to retreat after two months. In July and August ]930 the Haji of Turangzai attempted without success to raise another lashkar to enter the Peshawar District through Gandao. Ihe Mohmand assured clans not only remained staunch to their engagements with the British Government, but two of them, the Halimzai and Tarakzai, also undertook to prevent the entry of the lashkar. The assured clans also resisted all Afridi attempts to embroil them against Government.MmaDldi:. anxious fog; tiwaris, fcr icy of iieiite: ! kief rei«: W.-W. F.

In 1853 an expedition was undertaken against the Jowaki village of Bon, with whose misbehaviour the Hassan Kbel and Ashu Khel had been associated. An Agreement (No. XII) was taken from them in November loOo. In 1806 a series of outrages committed in British territory led to the institution of a blockade against the Hassan Khel, which was terminated on the signature of an Agreement (No. XIII) in April 1867. 2i2 I466 N -- w - F - PROVINCE—PESHAWAR DISTRICT— Afridis. In 1876, when difficulties arose regarding the construction of a road through the Kohat Pass, the Hassan Khel and Ashu Khel became involv ed, and were included in the blockade instituted in consequence; but in February 18T7 they offered their submission, which was accepted. Both the Hassan Khel tand Ashu Khel refrained from participation in the general Afridi rising of 1897; but the Ashu Khel afterwards com mitted a number of serious raids in the Peshawar District, for which they were fined in 1899 and 1900. Raids committed in 1916-17 by a gang of outlaws living in Janakhor and Khui, assisted by individuals of the Hassan Khel and Ashu Khel, led to the imposition of a fine of Rs. 5,000: and in 1921, in similar circmn- stances, they were fined Rs. 4,203. In 1923 the Hassan Khel and Ashu Khel maliks undertook, [see Article 4 of the Kohat Agreement of that year, Part V, No. VII) not to harbour outlaws from British territory. This Agreement also included an Article (No. 3) regarding the establishment of Khassadar posts on the Kohat road : and in 1925 the Hassan Khel and Ashu Khel openly declared their intention to oppose the building of the posts. A blockade was enforced in March 1925, when a full jirga immediately came in and made sub mission. In 1929 the allowances of the Hassan Khel and Ashu Khel were stopped owing to their refusal to abstain from interference in the Sunni- Shia dispute on the Kohat border and to furnish the posts and Khassadars promised in the Kohat Agreement of 1923 {see Part V, No. VII). The Ashu Khel, however, accepted the Government terms in November 1929 and were paid their allowances. The three Khassadar posts were built early in 1930: the Ashu Khel post 'being constructed under tribal ar rangements and the Khui and Janakhor posts bv outside agency owing to refusal of the Hassan Khel to undertake their construction. Ihese sections jointly with the Jowakis of Bori and Pastawani (under Kohat control) were responsible for a serious raid on Akbarpura on the 22nd June 1930. They admitted that they were responsible for the raid on Jaroba village on the 22nd July 1930. Owing to their complicity in these two raids and to their failure to supply Khassadars, their allow ances continued to be withheld during the year 1930. I he retreat of the Tirah Afridis after their second incursion in the Peshawar District in August 1930 was largely directed on Kandao and Kalla Khel. Under the influence of a Kalla Khel mulla named Niamat Gul the Hassan Khel and Ashu Khel formed a tribal pact with the Kalla Khel and Jowakis of Bori and Pastawani, the chief term in which was an undertaking to give no information and to render no assistance to (xovernment. A severe warning was therefore given to these sections in November 1930 that any assistance given to the Tirah Afridis would render them liable to retaliatory action. In the Jaroba case, a fine of Rs. 800 was imposed on the Hassan Khel of Janakhor. The fine was promptly paid.ISfll. idtk fCIItlft N.-W. F. PROVINCE—PESHAWAR DISTRICT— Utman Khel —NO.

F. PROVINCE—KHIBER AGENCY. IV.-KHYBER AGENCY. The tribes under the political control of the Political Agent, Khyber, are the major portion of the Afridis, the Shinwaris, the Shilmanis and the Mullagoris. Of the eight Afridi clans, the Aka Khel, and the six clans—Kamarai, Knki Khel, Malikdin Khel, Qambar Khel, Sepah and Ziakkha Klid— collectively known as the Oola Khel, are entirely under his control: as well as the Jowakis of Tirah and the Kalla Khel section of the Ali Khel sub-division of the Ashu Khel (both forming part of the Adam Khel clan) whose political control was transferred in 1923, after the Ellis outrage, from the Deputy Commissioner, Kohat, to the Political Agent, Khyber, in the hope that the Oola Khel might exercise a restraining influence over them. The Aka Khel, who had previously been under the political control of the Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar, were transferred to that of the Political Agent, Khyber, in 1909. There are four divisions of the Shinwaris, only one of which—tke Ali Slier Khel—comes within the British sphere of influence. These are known as the Loargi Shinwaris. The Shilmanis are politically at one with the trans-frontier Mohmands and look upon them as their parent stock. The bulk of the Mullagoris live to the north of the Khyber Pass. In 1854 a serious outrage by Aka Khel, who attacked and destroyed the District Engineer's camp on the Kohat-Peshawar road, led to the despatch of a force which inflicted severe punishment, and the institu tion of a blockade, which was renewed in 1855 and resulted in an Agree ment (No. 1) concluded in January 1856. In January 1857 a party of British officers was fired on by the Kuki Khel, one of them being killed. A blockade was instituted, during the course of which the mutiny broke out; but the blockade was continued in full force and in August 1857 the Kuki Khel entered into an Agree ment (No. III). Some minor offences by the Zakkha Khel having led to the detention of individuals of the clan in British India, both the great factions, into which the Zakkha Khel were then divided, entered into Agreements (Nos. II and IV) in August 1857. The Sepah, Kamarai, Malikdin Khel and Qambar Khel migrate in winter to the Khajuri Valley, north of the Bara River, on the Peshawar border. This joint occupancy proved very inconvenient, as the res ponsible party could seldom be ascertained in cases of robbery by members of other clans. In 1861 a party of Zakkha Khel, who had been residing in Khajuri, attacked and plundered some British villagers graz ing cattle near by. Severe punishment was threatened unless the tribes concerned made immediate reparation and undertook joint responsibility in future. The Sepah and Kamarai entered into the required Agreement (No. V) in April 1861, and the Malikdin Khel and Qambar Khel shortly afterwards. The effect of these agreements was to close that corner of the district against the Zakkha Khel and other robbers. A long standing quarrel, between the Basi Khel section of the Aka Khel and the Akhorwal sub-division of the Hassan Khel division of thelif I N.-W. F. PROVINCE—KHYBER AGENCY. 475 Adam Khel (as to which, see Part V), regarding the claim of the former to a portion of land, called Kalamsada, near the entrance of the Kohat Pass, m respect of which the Basi Khel refused to abide by a decision of the Commissioner of Peshawar which they had previously agreed to accept, led to the Basi Khel being debarred from entering British territory in February 1867. After a brief interval they submitted, and accepted terms (No. ^ I) dictated in April 18G7. The decision disallowed the claim of the Basi Khel and imposed a seven years' truce between them and the Akhorwals; but increased the Basi Khel allowances, during the period of the agreement, from Ps. 600 to Ps. 1,000. In January 1880 annual allowances of Ps. 2,000 each were sanctioned for the Shilmanis and Mullagoris, in connection with the survey of a proposed road running through their limits, north of and roughly parallel with the Khyber pass. The conditions imposed in return for the subsidv were general good behaviour, active assistance in debarring gangs of Mohmand raiders from approaching the Khyber, and keeping open and secure to travellers the trade route lying through their valleys. By the Treaty of Gfandamak (see Vol. XIII, Afghanistan) concluded in 1879, it was stipulated that the British Government should retain in their own hands the control of the Khyber and Michni passes, and of all political relations with the independent tribes inhabiting thei country directly attached thereto. Though the treaty became null and void, its provisions as regards the Khyber were in the main adhered to in the arrangements subsequently made with the Amir Abdur Rahman: and the entire length of the pass, as far as Dakka opposite Lalpura, was placed under the control of the Punjab Government. The Afghan Government had granted allowances to the tribesmen in return for the pass being kept open for trade; but these allowances were irregularly paid and often suspended for years together, with the result that the road had become practically closed to commerce except on payment of almost prohibitive dues. On the transfer of the pass, arrangements were at once initiated for placing the relations between the British Govern ment and the tribesmen on a satisfactory footing. A conference was held at 1 eshawar in the autumn of 1880, and a settlement was finally arrived at, the terms of which were embodied in an Agreement (No. VIl) concluded in February 1881. Tinder this agreement, which was signed by the Kamarai, Kuki Khel, Malikdin Khel, Qambar Khel, SepalTand Zakkha Khel, and by the Loargi Shinwaris, the tribesmen accepted exclusive responsibility for the safety 'of the road. The signatory Afridi clans were granted annual allowances totalling Ps. 87,540, and the Shinwaris an annual allowance of Ps. 9,660. All the Afridi clans took an active part in the frontier rising of 1897. They attacked, sacked and burned Landi Kotal, Ali Masjid and the smaller Khyber posts, and a large Afridi contingent joined the Qrakzai in attacking the Samana forts. The Tirah expedition followed: and by April 1898 the Afridis had submitted and had paid, or given security for payment, a fine of Ps. 50,000 and 800 rifles. The Aka Khel were the last clan to submit. In October 1898 the Khyber Afridi clans accepted the terms of476 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—KHYBER AGENCY. Government on a formal Agreement (Xo. VIII). As an act of grace, their former allowances were then restored to them. The Aka Khel, who had been blockaded for their share in the rising of 1897, were again blockaded in 1899 owing to their refusal to pay the fines imposed for a number of serious raids committed by them. The fines were paid in 1900; but, in the meantime, the clan had been guiltv of a fresh series of offences, and the blockade was re-imposed in October 1900, though it was decided to confine this blockade to the most guiltv sections, which did not include the Basi Khel. The re-imposition of the blockade was immediately effective, and the Aka Khel paid the fines demanded. In 1902 the Aka Khel were fined lis. 1,200 for harbouring outlaws. In addition to the allowance of Rs. 1,000 granted in 1867 to the Basi Khel (see No. VI), which had been stopped on account of their participation in the frontier rising of 1897, but restored in 1899, the remainder of the Aka Khel received, under an Agreement (Xo. IX) concluded in October 1902, an allowance of Es. 4,000. In 1902 Government decided to make the road, in connection with the survey of which allowances had been granted to the Shilmanis and Mullagoris in January 1880. In consideration of their good behaviour during the construction of the road, the allowances of the Alullagoris and Shilmanis were increased to Rs. 5,000 each, and the Shinwari allowance which, under the Khyber Agreement of 1881 (Xo. VII), had been fixed at Rs. 9,660, was increased to Rs. 13,000. Agreements to this effect were taken from the Mullagoris (Xo. X) in 1904, and from the Shilmanis and Shinwaris (Xo. XI) in 1906. In 1908 continued raiding by the Tirah Zakkha Khel resulted in an expedition which reduced them to submission. An Agreement (Xo. XII) was taken from the Khyber Zakkha Khel and the five other Oola Khel clans, by which they became sureties for the future goofl behaviour of the Tirah Zakkha Khel. In 1915 the Khyber Afridi allowances were doubled, in connection with the doubling of the Khyber road. During the Afghan W ar of 1919 a number of raids were committed by the Afridis into the Peshawar and Kohat districts; but in Xovember of that year a jirga came in and expressed contrition. The terms imposed included a fine of Rs. 5,000 and suspension of their allowances. All the clans except the Zakkha Khel complied with the Government terms by March 1921, and the Zakkha Khel in February 1922. In 1921 the Khyber Railway was begun, and the annual allowances of the Khyber Afridis were increased by Rs. 84,040, and the Shinwari allowance by Rs. 16,000. An annual lungi allowance to the Afridi elders was also made of Rs. 12,000, In 1923, after the Foulkes and Ellis outrages (see Part V), in the former of which the Qambar Khel and Zakkha Khel had participated, while the Jowakis were largely responsible for both, a joint Agreement (Xo. XIII) was taken from the Afridis and Orakzai. By this they bound themselves not to allow the outlaws concerned to enter their tribal limits, and undertook to arrest them and hand them over to theN.-W. F. PROVINCE—KHYBER AGENCY. 477 authorities should they do so. A special supplementary Agreement (No. XIV) was given in 1924 by the Malikdin Khel and Qambar Khel, promising active co-operation in the exclusion of these outlaws from Tirah Adam Khel country. At the same time the Tirah Jowakis and the Kalla Khel section of the Ali Khel Ashu Khel, whose political control had, as already stated, been transferred from the Deputy Com missioner, Kohat, to the Khyber Agency after the Ellis outrage, gave an Agreement (No. XV) similar to that taken from the Afridi and Orakzai clans. In the spring of 1930, after receiving their allowances and returning to Tirah, the Afridis came under the influence of Indian politics and the Congress agitation in Peshawar District. By the 10th May they had assembled a large lashkar composed of contingents from the Aka Khel, Sepah, Kamarai, Malikdin Khel, Qambar Khel, Kuki Khel and Zakkha Khel and occupied the cave dwellings at Tauda China and the low hills on the western border of the Khajuri Plain. This lashkar even tually attained a strength of about 10,000 and on the evening of the 4th June a contingent of some 3,000 men advanced on Peshawar, their advance guard entering the outskirts of the City, and the remain der establishing themselves in villages and gardens between Bara and Peshawar Cantonment. They were engaged by ground troops and by the 7th June the whole lashkar had left the District, one party sustaining heavy casualties from aerial bombing as they crossed the boidei. X ndeterred by this failure and incited by intensive propa ganda from British India, the irresponsible elements among the Afridis succeeded in assembling another lashkar in the caves to the m est of the Khajuri Plain by the i th August. They entered the District on the night of the 7th/8th August in gangs of 50 to 200 strong and although opposed by military and Frontier Constabulary pickets succeeded in making their way into the heart of the District concentrating mainly in the thickly wooded belt to the south and south east of Peshawar and amongst the ravines further to the east. From this shelter they made a number of unsuccessful attempts to enter the City and Cantonments and one party forced its way into the Supply Depot where it did considerable damage before being driven out. Owing to various reasons—the smallness and mobility of the gangs, the height of the crops affording excellent cover, and the shelter, food and assistance given by the villages round Peshawar—the troops had great difficulty in locating the enemy or expelling them from the District. However as the result of constant pressure by troops and aeroplanes the last of the invading gangs had left the District by the 20th August. All sections of the Afridis were involved in these unprovoked attacks and it was therefore decided as a punishment for their offence and a precaution against similar attacks in future to construct posts and roads in the Khajuri and Aka Khel plains. The Afridi jirga when summoned was unable to agiee to this action and a blockade of the Tirah sections was therefore put into force. During the winter the posts and roads were constructed with little interference. Up to the end of 1930 the Afridis had neither taken hostile action nor made peace.478 N.-W. F.

The jiriza has been summoned by you to assemble in Peshawar on the 24th October 1898, and I now am to convey instructions as to the manner iu which you and vour colleatrue will announce tne Government terms and explain their nature and attention. 3. The announcement to be made is to the following effect:— first,—-The Afridis by their own acts ruptured all agreements, forfeited all allowances, and forced the British Government to take and hold the Pass which, as already announced by Sir William Lockhart, will be managed and controlled as rhe British Government think most desirable. Second. —The Pass will be kept open for trade. The British Government will build a fort at Landi Kotal and posts between that and Jamrud, will keep up a jiood road or roads and, if they want it, a railway, and will take such measures as thev think fit to punish offences and preserve order on road and railway, in the fort and posts, and in the neighbourhood where necessary for their purposes. Third. —-The Afridis will have no dealings with any power but the British. They will be left to manage their own affairs in their own country ; but, in the Khyber Pass, they are responsible to the British Government that they will co operate to preserve order and security of life and property on roads or railway and within the limits of the Pass. Fourth. —-The British Government will give allowances as formerly to the Khyber Afridi clans for discharging this duty, and will maintain a militia recruited from the Afridi and other tribes and commanded by British officers. The British Government do not undertake to always keep troops at Landi Kotal, but will make arrangements for supporting the militia if circumstances require. Fifth. —Arrangements for trade in the Khyber will be made by the British Government, and the militia will be used for guarding traders. Sixth. —'The allowances granted by the British Government will commence to reckon from the date of the adhesion by the tribe to the terms settled by the Government of India ; but they are subject to withdrawal for misbehaviour in the Pass, iu British India, or against the friends or allies of Government. * ♦ ♦ % it * Translation of written statement of acceptance of orders of Government handed in by Maliks, elders ami representatives of the Khyber Afridis in full jirga.

As regards those who lead the gangs in committing raids in British Territory, we beg to state that wherever they may be found we will punish them with the help of the Zakka Khel to the satisfaction of the Government, and as a security for the execution of this undertaking we submit 53 rifles which according to the present market rate cost Rs. 20,000 and which may kindly be returned to us when the Political Agent, Khyber, has been satisfied that the raiders have been satisfactorily punished. We, the Zakka Khel clan, agree to the request of the Afridi Jirga and under take to help them in every way. For the rest we hope gracious and merciful treatment at the hands of the Gov ernment. Ends.

The trans-border tribes under tlie political control of the Deputy Commissioner, Kohat, are the greater part of the Adam Khel clan of the Afridis; the majority of the Orakzai; and one section of the (Kohat) Bangash, of whom the remainder live either in the Kohat District or the Kurram Agency. 1. AFRIDIS. The Adam Khel clan was formerly altogether under the political control of the Deputy Commissioner, Kohat; but in 1896 and 1807 the control of the Janakhori sub-division of the Hassan Khel division of the clan, and of the Kandau and Kandar sections of the Ashu Khel division, was transferred to the Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar: and in 192') that of the Jowakis of Tirah, and of the Kalla Khel section of the Ali Khel sub-division of the Ashu Khel, to the Political Agent, Khyber. There are four divisions of the Adam Khel clan—Galai, Jowaki, Hassan Khel and Ashu Khel. The Galai can control the whole of the Peshawar-Kohat pass, in which they live. There are four sub-divisions of the Galai—Tor Sapar, Zargun Khel, Sharakki and Bosti Khel. In 1849, immediately after the annexation of the Punjab, the Galai entered into an agreement to keep communication through the Kohat pass open, in consideration of an annual payment of Rs. 5,700. Their sus picions were, however, aroused by the construction of a road from Kohat: and in February 1850 a party of sappers, engaged on the road, was attacked by the Galai and the Akhorwal Hassan Khel. A force entered the pass and inflicted punishment; and a blockade was instituted, under pressure of which the Galai sued for terms in September 1850. Their allowances, which had been forfeited in consequence of their recent misconduct, were restored on condition of their accepting responsibility for the security of the pass. In order to strengthen the arrgangement, Rahmat Khan, a malik of the neighbouring Orakzai, was admitted to a share in the responsibility and was granted a personal allowance of Rs. 2,000 a year, besides Rs. 6,000 as the pay of a guard to be main tained on the crest of the ridge near Kohat. The total annual allowances granted for the security of the Kohat pass thus aggregated Rs. 13,700. The Jowakis inhabit a strip of country to the east of the Kohat pass and were thus conveniently situated for raiding into both the Peshawar and Kohat districts. Throughout the Sikh rule, the Sweri (northern— literally ' shady ') Jowaki village of Bori had been notorious as the residence of freebooters who plundered on the Attock road : and after the annexation of the Punjab its depredations increased. The Pitao (southern—literally ' f sunny ') Jowakis also committed offences in the Kohat district; and in 1851 an Agreement (No. I) was taken from them, by which they accepted responsibility for offences committed in the494 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—KOHAT DIST1MCT— A f rid is of the Kohat Pass. Ivohat district, and undertook to deny passage to freebooters to or from Bori. Towards the end of 1853 continued misconduct on tlie part of the Galai necessitated a change: and Government decided to confine the responsibility of the Galai to their own defile, and to entrust to the Han gash the road from Kohat to the crest of the mountain. The Galai successfully opposed the Bangash, whereupon Government prepared to intervene by force of arms. The Galai promptly submitted and accepted the Government terms (No. II) in December 1853. At the same time, an Agreement (No. Ill) was taken from the Pitao Jowakis, under which they were admitted to a share in the allowances for the protection of the Kohat pass. They received Rs. 2,000 a year on this account. The continued misconduct of the Sweri Jowaki village of Bori neces sitated the despatch of a force against them in November 1853. Bori was destroyed and the Boriwals submitted; and an Agreement (No. IV) was taken from them in January 1854. The Hassan Khel and Aslm Khel were both implicated in the Bori depredations, and signed a separate Agreement {see Part III, No. XII) on that occasion. The Akhorwal Hassan Khel were included in the blockade instituted in 1806, and signed the Agreement (see Part III, No. XIII) in April 1867 accepting the terms then imposed. lleference has been made in Part IV to the quarrel between the Basi Khel section of the Aka Khel, and the Akhorwal Hassan Khel, regarding the ownership of the Kalamsada lands. Under the Agreement of December 1853 (No. IT) the Galai had relinquished Rs. 300 of their annual allowances of Rs. 5,700 to the Basi Khel, who were thus admitted to a share in the allowances granted for the security of the Kohat pass. It was mainly on account of their claim to Kalamsada that this allowance was granted to the Basi Khel; but, in the terms dictated to them in April 1867 (see Part IV, No, A 7 1) their claim to Kalamsada was disallow ed. r l he decision then arrived at, which imposed a seven years' truce, was announced to and accepted by the Galai and the Akhorwals, as well as the Basi Khel. In 1875 negotiations for the construction of a good road through the Kohat pass were opened with the Galai, who were bound by agreement to undertake it: and they were offered the alternative of doing so or of foregoing their allowances. The Galai as a whole were willing to agree, but were oppose*! by the Sharakki section, who resorted to open outrage in order to embroil the Galai. The main body were unable or unwilling to coerce the Sharakkis, against whom a blockade was instituted in February 1876. The Hassan Khel and Ashu Khel became in\olved in the quarrel, and in August the blockade was extended toN.-VV. P.

The brother of one of them, malik Mushki of Mundand continued for years to raid British territory and gave infinite trouble, till his village was surprised and he himself captured by a force from Kohat m November 1889; whereupon depredations on the iUuishalgarli road and adjacent villages absolutely ceased. In 1892 Government sanctioned the discontinuance of the maintenance 0 le Jowaki hostages, and the money thus saved (lis. 1,848 a year) w^as granted to the Jowakis as an allowance on conditions set forth in an greement (Is o. \ ) then taken from them. This Agreement cancelled chose of 1851 and 1853 (Nos. I and III). In 1894 the Boriwal Jowakis claimed a share in the new allowances sanctioned in 1892 for their fellow tribesmen; but the claim was rejected. fn 189b the Hassan Khel, except the Akhorwals, and in 1897 the Asiiu Khel of Kandau and Kandar, were transferred from the control P i eputy Commissioner, Kohat, to that of the Deputy Commissioner, 1 6SJici \Vcir, In September 1899 the Galai and Akhorwals agreed (No. VI) to the construction of a metalled road through their limits in the Kohat Pass, XI 0 2 L1 490 N - W - F - PROVINCE-KOHAT DISTRICT— Afridis of the Kohat Pass. and received nn inrrease of Ks. 3,000 in their annual subsidy. The remainder of the Hassan Kliel petitioned for a share in the increased allowance; but their claim was rejected. in 1919, in consideration of their tjood behaviour during 1 the Great War and the Afghan War of 1919, the allowances of the Kohat Pass Afridis and of the Jowakis were doubled. Tn 1920 began the series of spectacular outrag-es in Kohat, the moving spirit in which was Ajab Khan, a member of the Bosti Kliel section of the Galai. For these outrages the Towakis were largely responsible, and several of the Galai sections were implicated. In November 1920 Colonel and Mrs. Foulkes were murdered in their house in Kohat can tonment: in November 1921 and February 1923 Kohat was raided, two persons being killed on the former occasion and 46 rifles stolen on the second: and in April 1928 the house of Major Ellis, in Kohat canton ment, was attacked in his absence, his wife was murdered and his daughter abducted. Miss Ellis was rescued unharmed a few days later, owing to vigorous action taken against the culprits with the co-operation of all the Afridi and Orakzai clans. Ajab and his gang were hunted from tribal territory, most of them taking refuge in Afghanistan, where they were interned by the Afghan Government. The tribes were held strictly to account for harbouring and giving passage to Ajab Khan's gang, and the Bosti Khel and Sharakki sub-divisions, and the Suni Khel section of the Zargun Khel sub-division, of the Galai paid a fine of Us. 50.000. With a view to the future protection of Kohat, an Agreement (No. VIT) was taken from the Adam Khel in May 1928. This Agreement, which was signed by all four divisions of the clan—the Galai, Jowaki, Hassan Khel and Ashu Khel—was supplementary to that signed by all the Afridis and Orakzai (see Part IV, No. XIIT) at the same time. In 1928 the Hassan Khel were fined for failing to act up to the Kohat agreement by omitting to notify the authorities of the presence of outlaws within their limits : and in the same year the control of the Tirah •Towakis, who had been fined Rs. 12,000 for their complicity in the boulkes' murders, was transferred from the Deputy Commissioner, Kohat, to the Political Agent, Khyber. Tn 1925 the Hassan Khel and Ashu Khel declared their intention to oppose the building of posts for their quota of khassadars imposed on them by Article 3 of the Kohat Agreement. A blockade was enforced, whereupon they immediately submitted. Several cases of faction fighting among the Zarghun Khel having resulted in casualties to travellers on the Kohat Pass road, fine® were inflicted, of Rs. 1,000 on the offending faction in November 1924, and of Rs, 10,000 on both factions in June 1926. On the latter occasion, an Agreement (No. VTIT) was taken from the Galai and the AkhorwalN.-W. F. PROVINCE-KOHAT DISTRICT— Orahzai. 497 Hassan Khel to ensure the safety of the road. Opportunity was taken at the same time, to impose an Agreement (No. IX) on the same siona- ones regarding the sale of Mills homhs, in which the Pass Afridis\ad been reported to be engaged. During the Afridi incursions into the Peshawar District in 1930 the (ralai, despite the severe pressure brought upon them, refused to become involved and loyally maintained the safety of the Kohat Pass road throughout this critical period. 2. ORAKZAI. T he Orakzai tribe is divided into six clans—Massuzai, Lashkarzai, Aiizai or Stun Khel, Muhammad Khel (Bar Muhammad Khel, Mani Khel S'pah or Sipaya and Abdul Aziz Khel), Daulatzai and Ismailzai (Akhel, Eabia Khel, Mamazai, Isa Khel and Sada Khel): and includes four affiliated alien c hamsaya '* clans—Mishti, Malla Khel, Sheikhan and Ah Khel. All these clans were originally under the political control of the Deputy Commissioner, Kohat; but, after the appointment of a Political Officer for Kurram in J893, the Massuzai, and the Pitao (southern) portion of the Alisherzai division of the Lashkarzai, wtere transferred to the control of the Political Agent, Kurram. In 1923 the Sweri (northern) Alisherzai were similarly transferred. The approximate fighting strength of the more important Orakzai clans is as follows: Daulatzai 2,100: Muhammad Khel—Bar Muham mad Khel, Mani Khel and Sipah—2,800: Ismailzai—Akhel 1,200, Eabia Khel 2,000, Mamazai 800, Isa Khel 125 : the Mamuzai division of the Lashkarzai 3,200: Aiizai or Sturi Khel 400: and the hamsaya clans 13,500 Mishti 3,800, Malla Khel 1,800, Sheikhan 3,500 Ali Khel 5,700. In 1850, as already mentioned (Afridis, supra), Rahmat Khan, a malik of the neighbouring Orakzai was admitted to a share in the responsibility of the Kalai Adam Khel for the security of the Kohat 1 ass, receiving a personal allowance of lis. 2,000 a year and an annual allowance oi lis. 6,000 as the pay of a guard to be maintained on the (rest of the iidg'e near Kohat. Agreements were taken in December 1853 from the Bizoti and Firoz Khel divisions of the Daulatzai (No. X) and from the Sipah division of the Muhammad Khel (No. XI), under which the former received an annual allowance of Rs. 2,000 and the latter of Rs. 500. In March 1855 the TJtman Khel division of the Daulatzai were assigned a share in the allowances of the Bizoti and Firoz Khel, and an Agreement (No. XII) was taken from them. * Meaning according to frontier usage, 'dependant'. 2 ti 2N.-VV. F. PROVINCE—KOHAT DISTRICT-— Orakzai. After tlie annexation of the Miranzai Valley in 1851, numerous raids on the British border were rommitted by the Orakzai: and in 1855 the Rabia Khel division of the Ismailzai attacked and plundered a British village. A force was despatched against them, which inflicted consi derable punishment and brought about their immediate submission, recorded in an Agreement (No. XIII) taken from them in September 1855. In August 1858 Agreements (No. XIY) for general good conduct were taken from the Utman Khel and the Alisherzai. In 18G8 the Daulatzai attacked some police posts in British territory and a blockade was established against them, stiffened by punishment inflicted by a small force in February 1869. In 1809 the Alisherzai raided British territory in violation of their agreement of 1858, and a fresli Agreement (No. XV) was imposed upon them in March 1870. In April 1872 the Bar Muhammad Khel, Abdul Aziz Khel and Mani Khel divisions of the Muhammad Khel clan executed an Engagement (No. XA I) regulating their intercourse with the British Government: and in the following May the remaining division of the Muhammad Khel, the Sipah (more generally known as Sipaya) signed a similar Agreement (No. XVII). In 187() the T tman Khel Daulatzai sided with the Gralai Adam Khel Afridis in the disputes regarding the Kohat Pass, and committed a few outrages. Arrangements were made for isolating the whole of the Daulatzai, which produced an immediate return to good behaviour. During the Afghan War of 1878-79-80 several of the Orakzai clans gave considerable trouble. The Kabia Khel division of the Ismailzai harassed the British line of communications in the Miranzai Valley: the Akhel division^ with the Ali Khel hamsaya, displayed hostile activitv in November and December 1878: and both divisions of the Lashkarzai— the Alisherzai and Mamuzai—joined the Zaimusht {q.v., Part VI) in attacks on ihe Miranzai border in 1879. A settlement was effected with the Akhel and Ali Khel in January 1879; but this was soon disregarded, and throughout 18^9 and 1880 they continued to commit outrages on the border. Larly in 1880 the Alisherzai and Mamuzai submitted and paid the fines imposed; but shortly afterwards the Mamuzai again turned hostile, and a blockade was established. In August 18S0, in conjunction with the Akhel and Ali Khel, the Mamuzai committed a seiious raid in which eight British subjects were killed. A settlement with the Mamuzai was finally effected in March 1883, and arrangements were made for the payment of the balance of the fines due in the following November; but the fines incurred by the Akhel and Ali Khel remained unpaid until 1891.ijf N.-W.

Severe punishment was inflicted on the tribesmen, who surrendered unconditionally. It was found that they had been supported in their course of outrage by the Khan of Hangu and Ins famih, v\ho ^\el'e thereupon deported; and the tribesmen who had, until then, been under the direct management of the Khan came undei that ol ihe Deputy Commissioner, Kohat. It was resolved to maintain a British garrison on the Samana range, which divides Miranzai fiom the Khanki A alley; and the terms imposed included the construction of roads and posts on the Samana ridge, and the payment of revenue for lands south of the ridge. These terms were most un willingly accepted by the tribesmen ; and, as soon as the British troops had withdrawn, a powerful Orakzai combination was formed, assisted bj a contingent of Afndis, with a view to getting the terms altered, iii Apiil 1891 a treacherous attack was made on the military guards piotecting working parties on the Samana range; and a general confla gration followed, necessitating the despatch of the second Miranzai expedition, w hich inflicted severe punishment and resulted in the unconditional surrender of the tribesmen. Agreements were taken from the Akhel (No. XVIII) in May, and from the llabia Khel (No. XIX) in June—this latter superseding that of September 1855 (No. XIII) under which all the Government terms were accepted in full. Tribal service, at the rate of lis. 1,008 a year each, was granted to the liabia Khel and the Akhel; and in 1892 this was extended to the Mishti (Rs. 1,008) and Sheikhan (Rs. 648, increased to Rs. 1,008 in 1895) hamsaya clans, and the Muhammad Khel clan (Rs. 2,016). In June 1893 Agreements were taken from the Bar Muhammad Khel and Mani Khel (No. XX) and the Sturi Khel (No. XXI). In the former, which carried with it an allowance of Rs. 2,010 a year, it was originally intended to include the Abdul Aziz Khel also; but it was subsequently determined to confine it to the Bar Muhammad Khel and Mani Khel, in whose case it cancelled the Engagement of April 1872 (No. XVI). The latter remained in abeyance for six years, the Sturi Khel clan objecting that the allowance granted (Rs. 500 annually) was too small; but they finally accepted it in May 1899 after Government had waived the first article, regarding the maintenance of a tower. In 1893 the control of the Massuzai and Pitao Alisherzai, as well as that of the Zaimusht tribe, was transferred to the Political Agency, Kurram. All the Orakzai clans, except the Shia Muhammad Khel, joined in the frontier rebellion of 1897. In August the Daulatzai attacked, and captured or burned, a number of frontier police posts: and in: us N.-W. l&lt;\ PROVINCE—KOHAT DlStolCT— Orakzai. 501 —Kabia Khel, Akliel; Daulatzai—Bizoti, Utmau Khel, Fnoz Khel: Aluliamniad Khel—Bar Muhammad Khel, Mani Khel, Sipah: the I iiahwal division of the Sturi Kliel: and the hamsaya clans—Ali Khel, Malla Khel, Mishti, Sheikhan. In iJ2'o the control of the Sweri (northern) Alisherzai was transferred from the Deputy Commissioner, Kohat, to the Political Agent, Kurram. In the same year a fine of Its. 20,000 was imposed on the Orakzai for harbouring and giving passage to the gang responsible for the Ellis outrage: and in May 1923 the Orakzai and Afridis jointly executed an Agieement (Part IV, No. XIII) declaring the outlaws responsible for the Kohat outrages to be their enemies, and binding themselves to arrest and hand them over to Government if they entered their country. In Apiil l!)^4 the Ali Khel hamsaya clan, and the Mamuzai division of the Lashkarzai, entered into Agreements (Nos. XXVIII and XXIX) binding themselves to exclude the outlaws from their limits, and to help the Atiidi Lishkai despatched, in accordance with the orders of Government, against the Tirah Jowakis. I 1 or many years the Shia Orakzai have quarrelled amongst themselves and in 1923 this resulted in serious fighting between the Bar Muhammad Khel and Sipah (Sipaya) on the one side and the Mani Khel on the other, in which the Sunni Orakzai seized the chance of interfering. With the help of their Sunni allies the Mani Khel were successful. The Shia tribesmen therefore approached Government with a request that their country should be taken over as British territory and that they should be given levies to protect the long line of border adjoining the Kohat Distiict. It was not considered opportune to accept this responsibility, but every effort was made to maintain solidarity amongst the Shias and to establish permanent peace. In 1927, however, quarrels again broke out and the Sunni Orakzai at the instigation of Mulla Mahmud com bined with the Afridis and expelled the Shias from all their lands in the Mastura valley. I he Mulla refused all overtures for settlement whether from the Government or from the Shias themselves and preparations weie made tor expelling the Shias from the lands remaining to them in tribal territory. This compelled Government in 1928 to declare the lands iemaining to the Shias as a guaranteed area and Shia levies were enlisted to protect this area. After several abortive attacks on the Shias in 192(S and 19^0 the Sunni Orakzai and the Afridis eventually agreed to make peace with the Shias on terms suggested by Government. This Agieement (No. XXX) was signed in March 1930. As a result the lands which were in the occupation of the Shias before 1927 were restored to them. During the tribal unrest of 1930, in spite of the example set by the Afridis, the Orakzai under the political charge of this district held out against all attempts made to persuade them either to join the Afridis in their attack on Peshawar district or to make depredations on Kohat Z(%502 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—KOHAT DISTRICT— Bangash. district. This firm adherence to their agreements was the more credit- aide as the Orakzai under the political control of the Political An-ent Knrram, could not resist Hie temptation to attack that ag-eucy. 3. BANGASH. The Bangash are about equally divided in numbers between the Ivohat district and the Kurram Agency. Practically the whole of that part of the tribe which is under the control of the Deputy Commissioner, Kohat, lives on the British side of the border : the exception beino- the Biland Khel section of the Jamshedi sub-division of the Baizai division of the tribe. In 1853, when it was decided {see Afridis, supra) to confine the Galai Afridis' responsibility for the Kohat pass to their own defile, and to entrust to the Bangash the road from Kohat to the crest of the mountain, the Bangash attempted to take possession of the crest by force, but were driven back by the Galai, who claimed it as their own. The Bangash thereupon called upon the Daulatzai clan of the Orakzai, and the Sipah (Sipa\a) division of &lt;he Muhammad Khel, for aid; and assigned to them a portion of the annual allowance of Rs. 7,700 which they themselves received for the security of the pass from the crest to the Kohat entrance. 1 he*se an angements were given effect to in the Agreements given in 1853 by the Bizoti and Firoz Khel (No. X) and the Sipah (No. XI) to which the Utman Khel also adhered (No. XIT) in 1855. The first two of these Agreements both contain specific guarantees to the Bangash. The Biland Khel Bangash are associated with the Kabul Khel suh- duision ol the I tmanzai Wazirs. In 1922 they were granted an annual allowance of Rs. 2,500 as their share in the increased allowances sanc tioned tor the I tmanzai [see Parts VII and VIII) in that year: and an Agreement (No. XXXI) was taken from them in March 1926.ri ■ . _ . giras cest : ik N -W.

PKOVTNCE—KURRAM AGENCY— Turis. 531 VI.—KURRAM AGENCY. The most important tribes under the political control of the Political Agent, Tvni i am, are the Turis : part of the Orakzai : the Zaimusht; and the Chamkannis. Up to the time of the outbreak of the Afo-han War in 1878 the Kurram Valley was under the authority of the Amir of Kabul. In 1880 it was declared to be independent : and in 1892 its administration was permanently taken over by the British Government, a Political Officer for the Kurram being appointed in 1893. At the time that this appoint ment was made the Massuzai clan, and the Pitao (southern) portion of the Alisheizai division of the Jjashkarzai clan of the Orakzai were placed under the charge of the Political Officer, Kurram, together with the Zaimusht tribe : all of whom had previously been under the political control oi the Deputy Commissioner, Kohat. The Swleri (northern) portion of the Alisherzai was similarly transferred in 1923. 1. TURIS. The fighting strength of the Turis is about 6,000. Until about the middle of the nineteenth century the Turis of the Kurram Valley were an independent tribe, but were then conquered by the Afghans. The Turis gave trouble on the British border in 1853 and 1855, on each of which occasions they concluded a so-called Treaty (Nos. I and II) with the British authorities. About 1869 there was a recurrence of Turi aggression, mainly due to a quarrel between the Turis and Wazir tribes: and the Turis entered into a third Treaty ( j ST o . Ill) in December 1869, In 1878 the Turis were cruelly oppressed by the Afghan Governor and, in, despair of obtaining redress from the Amir, disavowed his authority. In 1878, on the outbreak of war with Afghanistan, British troops were despatched to the Kurram district and occupied it, being well received by the people. The Treaty of Gandamak [see Volume XIII, Afghanistan), which concluded the first stage of the war, provided by Article 9 that Kurram should in future be treated as an assigned district to be administered by the British Government, who were to pay to the Amir of Kabul any excess of revenue over expenditure. Under the settlement subsequently made with the Amir Abdur Rahman, the district was definitely excluded from Afghanistan. This arrangement was, however, subsequently modified (No. IV), the western portion, Hariob and the -Tajis, being restored before the close of 1880 to the Amir, while Kurram proper, with the Turis and Bangash—the Kurram river being fixed as the boundary—was declared independent. On the withdrawal of mg ia N.-W. F. PROVINCE—KUI?RAM AGfttiC\—Turn. British troops from the valley the tribes were informed that, so long as they desired it, the British Government would protect their independence against any interference oji the part of the Amir, conditionally on their following the advice which the British political officers might think oper to offer them. At the same time all desire to meddle in their internal affairs was disclaimed. In 1885, as a tentative measure and in the hope that the tribe would be able to manage their affairs more satisfactorily under his guidance, an Assistant Commissioner of the Punjab service was appointed to the Thai outpost on their border, and empowered to make occasional visits to the Kurram. The experiment did not, however, answer, and in, 1887 the Assistant Commissioner was withdrawn. In 1888 a joint British and Afghan Commission was appointed to settle outstanding disputes between the Turis and their Afghan neigli- bours; but tin's proved ineffective, and the British Commissioner and his escort were consequently withdrawn. The Amir was informed of this unsatisfactory result, and warned that his officials should not interfere with the Turis, who were regarded as independent by the British (xovern- ment. The Amir continued to complain of their conduct, and the Gov ernment of India offered to send :i British officer to enquire. At the end of 1891 the robber Chikkai [see ' 3. Zaimusht ' below) returned from a visit to Kabul and seized lower Kurram. The Turis appealed to the Government of India who, at the end of 1892, determined to act on their wishes and, on a suggestion made by the Amir, to send a political officer, accompanied by an escort of troops, to make some permanent settlement of affairs in Kurram. Accordingly a strong military escort entered the Valley in October 1892. The Zaimusht, who had forcibly taken posses sion of lower Kurram, withdrew quietly to their own country, and the administration of the Kurram Valley was taken over permanently by the British Government. A head-quarters station, with a fort, was con structed at Parachinar: and the Kurram Militia was raised in 1893. The Kurram Militia refused to serve outside the Valley during the Great War; but the Turis behaved well in 1919 in resisting the great . o n religious pressure that was brought to bear on them and in offering a stout resistance to the invasion of tribal lashkars from Khost and Hariob, although these lashkars were assisted by Afghan regulars, and Nadir Khan s investment of Thai isolated the Valley for some weeks. In August 1919 the Viceroy visited the Valley, when the Turis felt considerable disappointment, in the belief that their loyalty had not been adequately rewarded. This led to attempts by the tribe to gain favour with the Afghans, who were not averse to a Turi-Afghan iappiochemenf. 1 he situation was, however, changed by an unpro voked attack by Mangals and Khostwals on a Turi encampment in February 1920.N.-W. F. IWOVtNCE—fvUlillAM ACENCY— Turis. 533 111 November Captain and Mrs. TVatts were nmrdered at Parachinar in circumstances clearly indicating that the outrage was the work of the gang which murdered Mrs, Ellis and abducted Miss Ellis from Koliat in April of the same year. In 1924 and 1925 the Valley was greatly affected by the rebellion in Khost. A contingent of about 200 Turi irregulars joined the Amir : and, after spending some months in Kabul, returned to the Valley in the summer of 1925. Successive Commissions have been held from time to time to settle cases between the Turis and Jajis. One was held in 1910, another was about to assemble in 1923, when the Watts' murders and the Khost rebellion caused its abandonment, and a third was appointed in the spring of 1928, but owing to the disturbed state of Afghanistan did not materialise. In 1926 an Anglo-Afghan Boundary Commission was appointed to determine the position of and to re-erect the old boundary pillars in the Peiwar area. The correct position of the pillars between Bar Gawi and Bala Hissar was determined and six pillars were erected; but no agree ment was arrived at regarding pillars in the vicinity of Ut Sar and Bala Ilissar. In 1926-27 in spite of the Afghan offer of a yearly subsidy to the Turi Matam Khana in Parachinar and a promise to reopen the Lewanai water channel, the Turis were not drawn into Afghan intrigues; and in 1929, when Sirdars Nadir Khan and Shah Wali Khan entered Khost via Para chinar, they took no active interest in Afghan politics. In April 1929, owing to disturbances in Afghanistan and the dis appearance of Afghan control over the tribes on the Kurram border, a truce was concluded between the Jajis of the Jaji Maidan and the Turis at Lakka Tigga. The truce was the result of a request on the part of the Jajis and was approved by Government. It was extended to the Kharlachi border in August. As a result of these measures, peace pre vailed on the Jaji Maidan border; but on the Kharlachi border the Chamkannis took part in the attack oil Kharlachi during August and September 1930. In April 1930 a detachment of 200 Kurram Militia rendered a good account of themselves during the height of the political disturbances in the Peshawar District. This was the first occasion on which the Turis of the Kurram Militia had served outside the Agency. During August and September the Massozai and Para Chamkannis, who had been affected by Congress propaganda, after a series of minor offences attacked the Kurram in force. Almost simultaneously Afghan tribesmen made an unproved attack on the western border of the Agency. The Turis, who had been re-armed with over 3,000 '303 maga zine rifles, defended themselves with great determination and althoughN.-W. F. PROVINCE—KURRAM AGENCY— Turin and Orakzai. it was found necessary to call for military assistance, the trouble sub sided before the arrival of the troops. In recognition of their services one year's land revenue was remitted to the inhabitants of the Agency and all ranks of the Kurram Militia were granted an extra month's pay. Cash rewards were distributed and wound and family pensions were sanctioned for those of the village chighas who were killed or wounded. The year closed with feelings between the Turis and the Afghan tribes of Chamkanni and Ilariob very strained. The Peiwar trade route was closed and all intercourses between the Turis and the Chamkhannis and .Tajis of TTariob practically ceased. 2. OEAKZAI. The fighting strength of the Alisherzai is about 3,850. The Agree ments taken from them in 1858 and 1870 have been mentioned in Part V (Nos. XIV and XV, in that Part.) For their complicity in the Zaimusht attacks on the Miranzai border during the Afghan War of 1879, tke Alisherzai paid a fine of lis. 4,000. For some generations the Massuzai (fighting strength 3,700) had enjoyed the right of coming down en masse and living free for a day at the expense of certain villages in Kurram—in token, it is said, of the lands on which those villages are built having originally belonged to the Massuzai: and they also levied tolls upon traffic along the main road up the Kurram Valley. These tolls were commuted, before the Afghan War of 1878-79-80, by the Afghan Governor of Kurram for a cash allowance; but after the war the Massuzai resumed their practice of levying tolls and their semi-feudal claim to a day's feeding. In 1884 a British official was deputed to the Kurram Valley, and all the Massuzai claims were commuted for an annual cash payment of Rs. 500; but this payment appears to have ceased about 1886, when the Massuzai resumed their ancient rights. In 1893, after the British Government had taken over the administration of Kurram, and the Massuzai and Pitao Alisherzai had come under the control of the Political Officer, Kurram, the Mas suzai were granted an annual allowance of Rs. 500 in commutation of all their claims. Both the Massuzai and the Alisherzai took part in the frontier rising of 1897. The Massuzai country was visited by a column of the Tirah Expeditionary Force, and their allowance was forfeited. In December 1902 the Alisherzai and Zaimusht jointly signed an Agreement (No. V) acquiescing in the construction, and undertaking the protection, of a road passing through their limits. The Landaizai division of the Massuzai clan is sub-divided into the Dilmarzai and Mastu Khel, both Gar in politics, and the Ash Khel, who are Samil; and the Khwaja Khel division is also Samil. In 1902 it was decided to grant the Massuzai an annual allowance of Rs. 2,000,N.-W. F. PROVINCE—KURRAM AGENCY— Orakzai. 535 1 ( the Gar Massuzai to receive Rs. 1,200 and the Samil Massuzai Rs 800 In February 1903 an Agreement (No. VI) was taken from the Samii Massuzai; but payment of the (iar allowance was delayed owing- to the misconduct of the Mastu Khel. The Dilmarzai received their share b April 1903, and made an Agreement (No. VII); but the Mastu Khel did not make complete submission until October 1904, when they o&gt;ave an Agreement (No. VIII) and received their share of the allowance. In 1915 the Massuzai committed a series of raids in Kurram and were put under blockade from 1915 to 1922. In May 1919, after the outbreak of the Afghan war, the Massuzai and Alisherzai, together with the Khani Khel Chamkannis, attacked the Badama picket, but were repulsed with considerable loss. The Massuzai and Alisherzai jirgas were received by General Nadir Khan, who tried to persuade them to collect their lashkars; but this they declined to do until the Afghans should have made sufficient progress to afford effective support to the tribesmen. In 1921 the Alisherzai participated in the ambushing of a small party of Kurram Militia, three of whom were killed. Prompt punishment was inflicted on them by the Militia, in a retaliatory raid. In 1922 the work of converting the Badama picket into a permanent post was completed: and this, combined with the pressure of the blockade, brought about the submission of the Massuzai. Then- allowances for seven years were confiscated and they restored 17 Govern ment rifles. The Alisherzai signed the joint Afridi-Orakzai Agreement of May 1923 (Pait IA , No. XIII) after Ihe Kllis outrage: and a similar ag-ree- ment was signed at the same time by the Mastu Khel and Dilmarzai sub-divisions of the Landaizai Massuzai, and the Mandu Khel sub-divi sion of the Khwaja Khel. In September 1923, after the transfer of the Sweri (northern) Alisherzai to the control of the Political Agent, Kurram, the Alisher- zai were granted an annual allowance of Rs. 1,800, plus a lungi allowance of Rs. 600, and an Agreement (No. IX) was taken from them. After the raising of the blockade against the Massuzai in 1922 up to 1930 the behaviour of the tribe was good. In 1930, however, they were badly infected by Congress propaganda from Afridi Tirah. They failed to come in for their allowances and eventually after committing various minor offences had the temerity to organise and commit an attack on Badama Militia Post on the night of the 9-10th August. They were beaten off with loss but eventually Massuzai country had to be bombed by the Royal Air Force before they would submit. Ultimately they surrendered forty Maliks as hostages and 100 rifles as security for their future good behaviour.^ ^ | 0 |&gt;J?OV INCK -Kli n H AM AGENCY—Orafezai and Zairuushi. ij36 No offences were conimitted by the Alisherzai for several years but, during the winter of 1930, when the Afridis were under (blockade, they gave shelter to a large number of Afndi families. 3. ZAIMTJSHT. In 1858 the Zainvusht entered into an Agreement (see Part V, No. XFV) for the regulation of their intercourse with the British Government. In 1879, during the Afghan War, the Zaimusht and the Lashkami Orakzai committed a series of offences on the Thal-Kurram road and the Miranzai border, including tlie murder of two liritisli officers and an attack on a military convoy. An expedition was sent against them in December 1879 and heavy punishment was inflicted on them. Their sub mission soon followed: heavy fines were realised, and hostages surrender ed: and in February 1880 the Zaimusht made formal submission at Kohat, promising to keep open the road through the Zaimusht \alley. In 1891 under the leadership of a notorious fieebooter named Sarwar Khan, alias Chikkai, the Zaimusht seized a considerable part of lower Kurram; but, when arrangements were made, at the end of 1892, foi the temporary occupation of the Kurram A alley by British troops, Chikkai and the Zaimusht evacuated the lands that they had seized, without waiting to be coerced. In December 1902 the Zaimusht and Alisherzai signed a joint Agreement (No. acquiescing in the construction, and undertaking the protection, of a road passing through their limits. In January 1903 the Zaimusht were granted an annual allowance of Ks. 3,500, and an Agreement (No. X) was taken from them. The two divisions of the tribe, the Khoedad Khel and the Mamozai, received Us. 1,500 and Es. 1,000 respectively; the balance of Rs. 1,000 being reserved for the grant of Juiujis to leading maliks. During the Afghan War of 1919, General Nadir Khan succeeded in persuading some of the Zaimusht to assist in his investment of lhal, but the tribe as a whole was not involved. Certain nomad AVazirs, who had gradually begun to settle in Khoedad Khel limits, committed numerous offences in the Kurram A alley between 1918 and 1922. The Khoedad Khel, who did not welcome their presence, but were unable to combine to turn them out, were held to account foi violation of their territorial responsibility : and ultimately paid a fine, surrendered a number of Government rifles, and gave security for the future good conduct of the AVazir settlers. In October 1922 some Militia deserters from Ivliost ambushed a patrol of the Kurram Militia within the limits of the Watizai sub -divi sion of the Mamozai. For this the Watizai were fined Us. 5,000.hi ■■ \22C ^•-W. 1*.

On account of tlieir terriorial responsibility ;in&lt;l ot the apathy shown by them subsequent to the commission of these offences a fine of lis. 1,000 was imposed on the Khoedad Khel. The question of harbouring outlaws by the Khoedad Khel had become acute and in ^luly J!)28 that portion of the agreement of 1903 referring to outlaws was revised and the tribe made to accept the following terms : — (1) Outlaws from British territory who took refuge with the tribe prior to May 1927 were to be permitted to remain with the tribe provided security was furnished for their good bebaviour. (2) Outlaws taking refuge after May 1927 were to be turned out forthwith. (V)) No outlaws were to be harboured in future. A conditional fine of Es. 500 was imposed on the tribe for each new outlaw. A portion, i.e., lis. 300, was refundable on receipt of proof that the outlaw had been turned out of Khoedad Khel limits and had remained outside their limits for a year. The full fine was refundable on the satisfactory termination of the case against the outlaw. Beyond giving shelter, at a price, to a large number of Afridi families during the winter of 1930, the Zaimusht remained loyal to their agreements and took no part either in Congress agitation or in the dis turbances of August and September 1930. 4. CHAMKANNIS. The Chamkanni tribe consists of four clans—Khani Khel, Khwajak, Haji or Para Khel (the true Para-Chamkanni, though the whole tribe is commonly so designated), and Bada Khel. The last-named clan has left Chamkanni country and settled permanently in the Kurram. During the Afghan administration of Kurram, the Chamkannis, especially the Khani Khel, constantly raided the \ alley, and continued to do so after the British Government had taken over the administration. The tribe took part in the general rising of 1897 and their country was visited by troops, without, however, any permanent effect. A completely successful counter-raid from Kurram led to the surrender of the tribe, who paid a fine of guns and rifles and promised amendment: and in 1901 Government sanctioned a yearly allowance of Es. 1,000. Soon afterwards, the Khani Khel again began raiding; but in 1902 tendered their submission and furnished security for good behaviour; whereupon the annual allowance of the tribe was increased to Es. 1,200. No agreement was taken, on this occasion. PI538 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—KUJiUAM AGENCY— Chamkannis. it From 1904 to 1908 the Chamkannis committed frequent raids: but after 1909 the behaviour of the Khwajak aud Haji Khel improved. During the Afghan War of 1919 the Khani Khei took part in the attack on the Badama picket: and their jirga was received by General Nadir Khan, who unsuccessfully tried to persuade them to collect their lashkar. In May 192^3 the Chamkannis signed an Agreement (No. XI) uuder- taking to exclude from their limits the leaders of the gang responsible for the Ellis outrage. In September 1925 a tribal dispute led to the Khwajak and Haji Khel firiug on the Political Agent, and to the consequent despatch of a small force from Parachinar to punish them. Between 1923 and 192G Khani Khel depredations became increas ingly frequent, and in 1925 they were fined two years' allowances. They then refused to come in to receive their allowances until May 1927, wben a satisfactory settlement was effected regarding cases outstanding against them: and it Avas agreed that, as an experimental measure during the following three years, instead of the tribe being held jointly responsible, each clan would be treated separately for purposes of fines or rewards. Between 1927 and 1929 the behaviour of all sections of the Para Chamkannis was unsatisfactory, and the Khani Khel allowances for 1927-28 were forfeited in order to satisfy decrees passed against them. Continuous disputes between the residents of Jalandhar village and the Haji Khel over the grazing in the vicinity of Manosam necessitated the establishment of a temporary Militia picket at Manosam; and in April 1929 the boundary between the Jalandharis and the Haji Khel was delineated by the Political Agent. The Haji Khel, however, ignored the boundary and, when arrangements were made to intercept their cattle grazing on the Kurram side of the boundary on the IGth April, they occupied the crest line and fired on a Kurram Militia patrol. Punitive action was therefore taken against them and Manosam was permanently occupied in May 1929. In 1930 the Chamkannis were badly affected by Congress propaganda from Afridi Tirah, and in August a series of minor offences by them cul minated in a heavy attack on Arghanja Patai and Manosam, during the course of which they received heavy casualties. Air action was taken; and they were bombed into submission and surrendered rifles and hostages as security for their future good behaviour.N -W. F.

It is well known to Your Highness that in the letters addressed to Your Highness, to Tnr- kistan, by the British authorities at Kabul, it was said that it was impossible to discuss the treaty made with the ex-Amir, Muhammad Yakub Khan, in respect to the north-western frontier (of India). And it was assumed that Your Highness had thoroughly understood the ideas expressed in those letters regarding the frontier districts occupied (by Government). Therefore the province of Kuram cannot be included in those cities (provinces), which the British Government admitted and acknowledged as the dependencies of the kingdom of Kabul. With regard to the Furis inhabiting the Kiiram valley. Government has decided that they should not, according to the engagement made (with them) some time ago, be placed under Your Highness ; and that their independence conformably to their wish should be maintained. With respect to Hariab, which is beyond the Peiwar Kotal to the west, al though it is, no doubt, also included in the districts occupied, the British Gov ernment, out of regard for Your Highness' friendship, and with a view to strength en your kingdom and also deeming it fit to let the Jajis (who inhabit that district) be under the government of an ally, has relinquished the said Jaji ' ilaka ' of Hariab to Your Highness, Arrangements for transferring the government (of that ' ilaka ') to Your Highness' agents will be made when the British troops come down from the Kotal. Further, this letter has been addressed from the British Government through Major-General Watson, C. B. and V. C., the Officer in command of the British Force in Kuram, and signed by Major Arthur Conolly, the Political Officer of Hariab.' P roclamation issued to the M aliks and people of the T uri tribe in K uram. I, Major-General John Watson, Commanding the British Troops in the Kuram valley, am instructed to announce to the maliks and people of the Turi tribe that the British Government intends to withdraw its forces very shortly across the border. Under these circumstances, it has become necessary to make some arrange ment for the future administration of the district, and the matter has been con sidered with an earnest desire to meet, as far as possible, the wishes of the people. The British Government understands that the Turi tribe desire their country to be made independent. Consequently, I have now to announce that the British Government recognises their independence, and, so long as the Turis desire it, will regard their country as having no connection with the Amir of Kabul. Regarding the internal administration of the district and its protection against neighbouring independent tribes, the British Government does not wish to inter fere, and the Turis will be left free to make their own arrangements. In this matter also the British Government believes that it is consulting the interests of the tribe.542 N - W - F - PROVINCE— KURRAM AGENCY— Orakzai —NOS. V—19()9 AND VI—1903.

The transfrontier tribes under tlie political control of the Deputy Commissioner, Bannu, are part of the Darwesh Khel tribe of the Wazirs, and one (Dhanna) of the three divisions of the Bhitannis. 1. WAZIKS. Hie Wazir tribe of the Darwesh Khel, commonly known as the Wazirs, though the other great tribe of Waziristan, the Mahsuds, is a Wazir tribe also, is composed of two clans, the Utmanzai and Ahmadzai, There are three divisions of the Utmanzai clan—Ibrahim Khel, Mohmit Khel and Wali Khel: and three sub-divisions of the Wali Khel—the Kabul Khel, which is now under the political control of the Political Agent, North Waziristan, and the Bakka Khel and Jani Khel, which are under that of the Deputy Commissioner, Bannu. The Ahmadzai clan has two divisions—the Shin Khel and Kalu Khel: and the Kalu Khel has two sub-divisions—the Nasruddin Khel and Sperkai. The greater part of the Shin Khel and Sperkai Kalu Khel live on the Baimu border: the Nasruddin Khel Kalu Khel, who are mostly nomadic, are scattered about Wana (South W^aziristan) and the Kurram region (towards Spinwam) and have settlements in British terri tory and at Gumatti on the Bannu border. In 1870 the Muhammad Khel section of the Sperkai fired on a detach ment of troops on the Kurram road. Ileprisals followed, but the terms imposed by Government were not accepted until September 1871, when the Muhammad Khel surrendered unconditionally. The Sudan Khel section of the Sperkai, the Umarzai sub-division of the Shin Khel, and the Bizan Khel sub-section of the Nasruddin Khel Kalu Khel, who had actively or passively aided the Muhammad Khel. were called to account at the same time and punished. In April 1872 the Hathi Khel and Umarzai sub-divisions of the Shin Khel, the Muhammad Khel section of the Sperkai Kalu Khel, the Bizan Khel sub-section of the Nasruddin Khel Kalu Khel Ahmadzai and the Bakka Khel and Jani Khel sub divisions of the Wali Khel Utmanzai, entered into an Agreement (No. I) for the regulation of their frontier responsibility. Depredations were committed throughout 1881 by the Hathi Khel and other tribesmen on the Bannu border, aided by the Kabul Khel sub-division of the Wali Khel Utmanzai. In 1882 a settlement was effected, and the conduct of the Bannu Utmanzai improved: though in 1890 the Bakka Khel were fined Rs. 3,500 for misbehaviour. In 1895 the Ahmadzai and Utmanzai were granted allowances. In the same year, on the establishment of the Tochi (now North Waziristan) Political Agency, the Ibrahim Khel and Mohmit Khel divisions of the Utmanzai were transferred to the control of the Political Agent from that of the Deputy Commissioner, Bannu.548 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—BANNU DISTRICT— Wazirs. The behaviour of the Bakka Khel and Jani Khel continued to give trouble, the misconduct of the Bakka Khel being- due to internal feuds, and that of the Jani Khel to the presence of a gang of outlaws of whom they were unable to rid themselves until 1899. The presence of another gang of outlaws in the Sperkai village of (rumatti was also the source of ceaseless trouble on the Bannu frontier from 189G onwards. A long series of nmrders and robberies culminated in an attack on the Barganattu border military police post in January 1899 : and in the following November troops were despatched against Gumatti village. They were, however, successfully defied by the twelve principal outlaws, and sustained casualties on their return journey. When the village was again visited by troops a few days later, it was found to have been deserted. In 1900 Hathi Khel and Umarzai outlaws attacked Domel police station: in 1901 the Baran border military police station was raided, and the Muhammad Khel fined lis. 5 ,000; and in the same year the Jani Khel Utmanzai were fined lis. 5 ,000 for allowing a gang of raiders to pass through their limits and attack the police station of Ahmadzai. In June 1902 the Islam Chauki border military police post was attacked and a fine of lis. 10,000 inflicted on the Muhammad Khel, and on the Bakka Khel and Tori Khel Utmanzai, for their complicity in the affair. Finally, in November 1902, after another outrage had occurred at the Gurguri police station in the Kohat district, military operations were undertaken in the Thal- Idak tract of the Darwesh Khel country. The operations were completely successful, a large number of outlaws were subsequently surrendered to the Deputy Commissioner, Bannu, and order was restored all along the frontier. In 1903 negotiations were opened with the Wazir tribesmen for the construction of roads from the Tochi to Thai and from Thai to Bannu. Separate Agreements (No. II) were taken in April 1904 from the Ahmadzai Wazirs living on and near the Bannu border, who undertook to protect the Bannu-Thal road, and to accept other conditions, for allowances aggregating lis. 450 a year: the Muhammad Khel also accepting, in addition, responsibility in respect of the Bannu-Spinwam road for an additional annual allowance of Rs. 250. The Muhammad Khel gave some trouble in 1920-21, and punitive measures were undertaken against them in May 1921. In May 1922 the Bakka Khel and Jani Khel presented a petition (No. Ill) associating themselves with one presented at the same time by the remainder of the Utmanzai clan {see Part VIII) : and increased allowances were sanctioned for the Utmanzai and Bannu Ahmadzai. In September 1927 a feud between the Jani Khel and the Shabi Khel Mahsuds (a small colony of whom live on the Bannu border) was settled, both parties entering into an Agreement (see Part IX, No. XVII) whereby the lower Shaktu trade route was opened up and placed under their protection. Ihe Jani Khel signed the Agreement in November.N.-W. F. PROVINCE—BANNU D T STRICT— Bhitannis. 549 In April J 922, iu conformity witli the general policy adopted in Waziiistan, Khassadars were granted to the Wazir tribes of the Bannu district. In the summer of ] 930 all the Wazir tribes of the district, with the exception of the Sperkai and Muhammad Khel sections, shared in the general unrest. On the 24th August the Hathi Khel Wazirs held a mass meeting at Spina Tanga. A large party came into contact with a small body of troops which had been deputed to prevent the meeting. The murder of Captain Ashcroft of the 6/I3th Frontier Force Rifles, who was in command of the detachment of troops, resulted in a fierce encounter in which 19 men (including Captain Ashcroft) of the detachment were killed or wounded. The Hathi Khel were believed to have lost 20 killed and 18 wounded including the notorious Mulla Fazil Qadir who had been chiefly instrumental in rousing the tribe. After this incident the agitation subsided. 2. BHITANNIS. The Bhitanni tribe, a large proportion of whom are British subjects, consists of three clans—Dhanna, Tatta and Waraspun. Of these, the Dhanna aie under the political control of the Deputy Commissioner, Bannu, and the other two clans under that of the Deputy Commissioner, Dera Ismail Khan. All tlnee clans of the Bhitannis jointly accepted responsibility for the safety of the passes on both the Tank and Bannu frontiers in 1876: renewed this agreement in 1879 : and in 1890 accepted conditions regard ing service, allowances, etc., and re-affirmed their Pass responsibilities, before the Deputy Commissioner, Dera Ismail Khan (see Part X Nos I, II and III). In 186'j-()6 a settlement was made with the Bhitannis whereby they were given a large tract of land in the Bannu district, on condition that they brought the land under cultivation and that the Dhanna made themselves responsible for the passes leading through their limits into British territory. In March 1883 the three divisions of the Dhanna clan—Boba, Bobak and Wargara executed an Agreement (No. IV) accepting responsibility for the passes in the Bannu district. In I89G internal feuds among the Dhanna Bhitannis of Bannu caused some trouble. The general agreement of 1890 remained in force until 1907, when it was renewed, by all three clans, under a revised Agreement [see Part X, No. IV). Owing to failure to implement their Pass responsibility, and general misconduct, the allowances of the tribe were suspended from 1914 to 1917. They were restored in 1917 and increased in 1919, when a renewed Agreement (No. V) was taken from the Dhanna clan. The Bhitannis were entirely unaffected by the disturbances of 1930, and their behaviour in recent years has been praiseworthy.m ^ : dS ■ HH 550 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—BANNU DISTRICT—Wazirs— NO. 1 —1872.

Your Excellency ,—In so far as now a map of our lands situated on the boundary of British territory, and showing the boundaries between each of us responsible tribes has been made, and we have by way of attestation put our seals and signatures to the same, we the Maliks and headmen whose names are attach ed by tribes at the end of this petition, with regard to our responsibility for the frontier included within our respective boundaries, do hereby agree to the follow ing rules, and petition that the Government may be pleased to sanction the same for future observance and guidance. We on our part agree always to abide by them :— (1) In so far as a rule in front of our lands in British territory the hills out of that territory to some distance belong to us, and for this reason from a long periorl we have been held responsible for the passes through them, and as that respon sibility has not been defined, at times we suffer undeserved hardships; for this reason for the future we present the following agreement. We are responsible for all stolen property taken from British territory to foreign territory by any passes, roads or hills included within our boundaries as defined according to tribes in the map and list hereto attached in this way ;— (а) We are in no way responsible until the Deputy Commissioner of the district has satisfied himself by enquiry that either by the evidence of track or other evi dence in truth stolen property has been taken through the bounds for which we are responsible into foreign territory. (б) When he has thus satisfied himself, then he or any assistant to whom he has given special orders shall summon the headmen of the responsible tribe through whose bounds stolen property has been taken, and shall give them a certain period, whatever may appear fair under the circumstances of the case, with the object that within the period fixed the responsible tribe may recover the stolen property or pay its value according to the estimate of the officer in question, or pay the ransom paid for its recovery if the property is recovered by payment of ransom, or produce the real culprits, or point out for attachment and seizure in British territory property belonging to or members of their tribe, or of that tribe with whom the stolen property is, and will, according to Afghan custom, prove the liability of such person, persons or tribe. (c) If within the fixed period we have the real criminals or sufficient persons or property of their tribe or of that tribe with which the stolen property is seized in British territory, and prove their liability according to Afghan custom, their compensation will be levied from that person or persons, or tribe, and the res- honsible tribe will be free.N.-W. F. PROVINCE—BANNU DISTRICT— Wazirs —N0. 1—1872. 55^ {d) If within the period fixed the responsible tribe do not recover the stolen property nor produce the criminal, nor have sufficient persons or property of his tribe seized, or are unable to prove their liability, then we will pay the value of ths stolen property or the amount of ransom paid for its recovery or fine as the Deputy Commissioner decides, and we will be permitted at any time within three years to produce the criminal or have members of his tribe or property of his tribe, or of that tribe with whom the stolen property is, seized in British territory and be reimbursed our loss and expenses from him or them if we first prove his or their liability according to Wazir custom. (2) If it is proved that the criminal belongs to the tribe which is responsible for the pass, road or bounds by which the stolen property has been taken to foreign territory, then the Deputy Commissioner may deprive us, so far as he pleases, of all the rights contained m the first condition, and will take the plundered propertv or its value from responsible tribe. (3) If the responsible tribe, according to Afghan custom, prove to the satis faction of the Deputy Commissioner that the stolen property which has been passed through their bounds into foreign territory has been stolen or the theft of it abetted by any British subject or any one resident in British territory, we will be entitled to the same rights with respect to him or them with regard to realization of com pensation or production of stolen property as is entered in condition (1). (4) All we heads of the Wazir tribes do solemnly agree that we will not allow as far as lays in our power and knowledge, the passage by the roads running through the bounds for which we are responsible, of any outside criminals who may, with bad intent or with intent to robbery or theft or any other crime against the subjects, or against the rule of the British Government, wish to pass openly into British territory, nor will we openly or secretly give them shelter or assistance. If we do, we will agree, on condition of proof, to any punishment the Deputy Com missioner may award, or we will prove our innocence to his satisfaction by oath or otherwise. (5) We also agree that We will not as far as We know give shelter or assistance, or a passage secretly, to any outside thieves, or allow our tribe to do so. (6) Whenever we get notice that any thief or band of robbers is carrying off plundered or stolen property from British territory, we will at once pursue along the roads in the bounds for which we are responsible, and will, as far as we can, recover the property, and if any British official joins in the pursuit, we will assist him, (7) Now we state the mode of decision according to Wazir custom. In the case of any dispute between us responsible tribes or other tribes the decision will be made in this way : If the responsible tribe state that a certain person is the cri minal, or that he belongs to the criminal's tribe, or that in his village or tribe the plundered property has been seen, their decision will be made in one of two ways :— First. —That suspected person or the tribesman of the suspected person who has been seized will clear himself by himself and two other persons of his tribe552 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—BANNU DISTRICT—Wazirs—NO. 1—1872. whomsoever the Deputy Commissioner or the plaintiffs agree to swearing that neither the suspected person nor any other person of their tribe were principals in the crime, nor abettors, nor advisers to it, nor instigated it, nor is the stolen property in their tribe, nor did their tribe receive the property or shelter the criminal. On their doing this, that suspected person or persons or property which has been seized will bo released, and the responsible tribe will be liable as if they had made no claim. In the case when the stolen property has been seen with the tribe upon whom claim is made by persons of the responsible tribe, the person or persons of the tribe against whom claim is made will not be entitled to swear, but two persons who saw the property will swear, and the claim will be considered as established ; but if the Deputy Commissioner is doubtful, or the defendants dis- catisfied, then, in addition to these two witnesses, headmen of the responsibls tribe may be selected, and they will be required to swear that the witnesses have not been made up for the occasion. If persons on the part of the responsible tribe have thus sworn, then the claim will be established. If there are no eye wit nesses, the defendants will be entitled to swear in the way stated above. Second. If a person or persons of the responsible tribe are suspected as being the criminals and there is no legal evidence against him or them, he or they and four connections of each selected by the trying officer will swear to the innocence of each, and on their doing so an acquittal will be ordered and the whole tribe will be liable as before, and if the presiding officer considers more evidence is re quired, he may call on the Malik of the suspected person or persons to swear that he does not know or consider the suspected person or persons to be the criminal or criminals. Third. In the same way, if any British subject or subjects are suspected of having aided or abetted the crime for which compensation has been taken from the responsible tribe in the case of there not being legal evidence, in the same way it will be required that they and four connections for each person and the Malik swear to the innocence, and then he or they will be entitled to an acquittal, and the responsible tribe will be liable as before. (8) We clearly understand that if any person or persons, whether subjects of the British Government or foreigners, found guilty in the Judicial courts are sen tenced according to law, the conditions above do not apply to these cases, but only in those in which legal evidence is not forthcoming, and which it is considered ought to be decided by Wazir custom, by seizure of property, etc, (9) Finally, we all confidently state that if these rules are sanctioned and carried out, we shall be able fully to discharge our responsibilities, and crime will certainly be reduced, and the punishment of the real criminals will be an example and warning to others. ' Baramta,' or what we Wazirs call ' Shaisa,' or sei zure of property as a reprisal, is an ancient and well known custom. If worked with discretion, it will not displease any tribe, and will have great advantage.

In 1922, as a corollary to the extended occupation of the Agency, the allowances of the Tochi tribes were increased from Us. 27,390-10-0 to l{s. 89,000. 1. WAZIRS. Two of the three divisions of the Utmanzai clan—the Ibrahim Ehel and Mohmit Khel—were transferred in 1895 from the control of the Deputy Commissioner, Uannu, to that of the Political Agent, Toclii: and in 1909 the Kabul Khel sub-division of the third (the Wali Khel) was similarly transferred from the control of the Deputy Coinmissioner, Kohat. The Kabul Khel, whose fighting strength is about 3,600, were the first to give trouble. Between 1851 and 1854 they committed a number of raids, and were blockaded. They submitted and gave an Agreement (No. T). In 1859 they gave shelter to the murderers of Captain Mecham, and a considerable force was despatched against them; but arrangements were made with them, and other tribesmen implicated, for the surrender of the murderers, and the objects of the expedition were attained without fighting. In 1869 the Kabul Khel were concerned in a raid on Thai, for which they were fined Rs. 2,000 and an Agreement (No II) was taken from them. In 1871 a counter-raid was made against the Saifali section of the Kabul Khel, who had been giving trouble, and an Agreement (No. Ill) was taken from them. In 1874 reprisals were made on the Miamai section of the Kabul Khel for plundering: and in March of the same year a military demonstration was made at Thai for the purpose of effecting a settlement of outstanding claims against various sections of the TJtmanzai. A satisfactory settlement was concluded in April with the Kabul Khel, including the Malikshahi section. In 1880, during the Afghan War, outrages were committed by some of the Mohmit Khel and the Tori Khel sub-division of the Ibrahim Khel. In October 1880 a military expedition entered Malikshahi country and collected penalties inflicted for offences committed on the Kurram route by the Kabul Khel and Malikshahi; but Kabul Khel depredations continued throughout 1881 and, though a further settle-mmmm i k N.-W.

A military force inflicted severe punishment on the Madda Khel, whose allowances were or eited. A settlement was effected in 1897, but this was not reduced to writing until 1901 (No. V), when new allowances were granted. In June ! 902 the Tori Khel took part in the attack on the Islam Chauki border military police post Part VII) and were included in e fine of Bs. 10,000 levied in consequence. The Tori Khel and Kabul el were also anion;; those who received punishment at the hands of he force operating in the Thal-Idak tract of the Darwesh Khel country in JNoveniber 1902 (see Part YIT). The negotiations of 1903 for the opening of roads in the Wassir country ( jcc Part VII) resulted in Agreements being taken in 1994 from the on Khel and Madda Khel sub-divisions of the Ibrahim Khel, and (he Mohmit Khel including the Hassan Khel sub-division (No. VI) and the Kabul Khel and others (No. VII). Both these Agreements provided lor the opening and safeguarding of the Idak-Thal road in consideration of allowances totalling Eg. 6,000 annually: while an additional annual a onance of Es. 924 was granted in the former in respect of the Pannu- Spinwam road, and of Es. 1,000 in the latter in respect of the Bannu- inal road. , * n 19 ^ the Mad(1a E:]lel were granted an additional Maliki allowance o Us - 3 ' 000 a and an Agreement (No. VIII) was taken from them. In April 1913 the Kabul Khel made an attack on the Spinwam post. In February 1914 a blockage was instituted against the Khostwals 0 ^hamstan, m consequence of continued incursions on the Tochi and Bannu borders by outlaws from Khost from 1909 onwards Three incursions into the Tochi were made by lashkars from Khost during 1914 and 1915, but they were driven back on each occasion. Tlle i, T)eIlavimir tIle TFtmanzai Wazirs remained satisfactory throughout the Great War, in spite of fjie anarchy in Khost and intrigue by Afghan officials, but the evacuation of the militia posts in the Tipper Tochi m May 1919, on the outbreak of the Afghan War, led to wide spread disturbances, which were intensified by the subsequent evacuation XIN.-W.

The Wazirs offered no opposition: and in November 1919 a representative jirga of all the Utmanzai clan, except the Madda Eh el and a few minor sections, made complete submission and complied with the terms of Government. The recalcitrant sections were subjected to bombing from the air, and shortly afterwards submitted also. Tn May 1922, owing to encroachments by the Mahsud tribe on Wazir lands, especially in the neighbourhood of Razmak, the Mohmit KM, Tori Khel and Kabul Khel presented a petition (No. IX) asking Govern ment to take over that area and to grant them increased allowances. The request was granted. The TJtmanzai allowances were accordingly increased, and Agreements were taken in August from the Madda Khel (No. X) and Manzar Khel (No. XI) sub-divisions of the Ibrahim Khel. In 1925 the Madda Khe] returned a number of the Government rifles taken by them during the Tochi Militia outbreak of 1919. In 1926 an Agreement (No. XII) was taken from the Tori Kliel for the lease to Government of the site of the Razmak camp at an annual rent of lis. 17,940. In 1928 the leased area of the camp was increased from 536 to 684 acres and the rental to Rs. 20,853. In November 1927 an Agreement was taken from the Tori Khel regarding the opening of the lower Shaktu trade route, identical in terms with that taken from the Shabi Khel Mahsuds (see Part IX, Xo. XVII) in the preceding September. In November 1928 the Madda Khel were blockaded owing to their unsatisfactory behaviour and the repudiation of their agreements with Government. A settlement whereby the tribe accepted Government's terms and renewed their agreement was effected on the 19th January 1929 and the blockade was raised. Intensive anti-Government propaganda in the adjoining districts of Kohat and Bannu arising out of the Civil Disobedience movement led to an outbreak on the part of the Madda Khel, Khiddar Khel and a few Manzar Khel in May 1930. The Datta Khel Scouts' Post was invested on the nth May by a lashkar composed of Madda Khel, Khiddar Khel and a few Kanirogha Manzar Khel. Prompt air action resulted in the dispersal of this lashkar and the complete submission of the Madda Khel and Khiddar Khel who paid fines of Rs. 15,000 and Rs. 4,000 respec tively. The Kanirogha section of the Manzar Khel was also fined Rs. 1,500. Despite a rising wave of anti-Government feeling in South Waziristan (//-v.) matters soon returned to normal in North Waziristnn and save tor a few cases of sniping and the participation by some Ton Khel malcontents in the seige of Sararogha nothing else of importance eventuated,N.-W. F. PROVINCE—NORTH WAZlRTSTAN AGENCY— Daurs. 5 61 2. DAURS. The Tochi Biver flows tlnough the two valleys of Upper and Lower Daur. Upper Daur is inhabited by the Malizad division of the tribe and by a large number of Darwesh Khel Wazirs, and Lower Daur bv the Tapizad division. The fighting strength of the Upper Danrs is estimated at 3,000, and that of the Lower Danrs at 4,000. The British (Government first came in contact with the Daurs in 1851, when they were concerned in an attack on a police guard, which was repulsed with heavy loss. In 1855 the East India Company formally renounced all claim to sovereignty over Daur in favour of Amir Do?t Muhammad; though the valley remained independent of Kabul, whos* rule over it was never more than nominal. ^ In 1870 the Upper and Lower Daurs assisted the Muhammad Khel Wazirs {see Part VII) against the British. For this, the Upper Daurs were fined lis. 1,500, which they paid; but the Lower Daurs, who had been fined Rs. 5,000, refused to pay until a small force was despatched against them, when they submitted unconditionally. In February 1872 an Agreement (No. XIII) was taken from the whole tribe. Raids committed by the tribe in 1876 led to their being summoned to come in and make reparation, which they did. But a similar sum mons, consequent on a raid committed in August 1877, remained unheeded, and a blockade was proclaimed, which lasted until June 1878. when the Daurs tendered their submission. In 1870 and 1880 the Daurs kept up a series of attacks on the British line of communications, mostly beyond the frontier; for which reason, no special action was taken against the tribe. The delimitation of the Waziristan-Afghan boundary took place in 1894-95 : and in April 1895, when the demarcation commission was in the Daur Valley, the Daurs and Wazirs inhabiting the valley petitioned the British Government to take over the valley in order to protect them from their Wazir and Mahsud neighbours. This was agreed to in October 1895, but no specific written agreement appears to have been made. At the same time the Daurs were granted an annual allowance of Rs. 4,884, subsequently increased to Rs. 6,768. The Upper Daurs rendered good service in connection with the Khostwal incursion of 1914 and the Mahsud disturbances of 1917. The tribe joined in the rising in Waziristan which accompanied the Afghan iVar of 1919, and punitive operations were undertaken against the Lower Daurs in the summer of that year, with successful results. In 1922 th e annual allowances of the tribe were increased to Rs. 17,000. 2 v 2N.-W. F. PROVINCE—NORTH WAZ1R1STAN AGENCY—Dawrs.

Their maliks, however, managed to withdraw this lashkar. The Upper Uaurs were fined lis. 2,000. The Lower Daurs remained loyal throughout.N.-W. F.

F- PROVINCE—NORTH WAZIRISTAN AGENCY— Wassira— 571 No. TX—1922, No. IX. Translation of a Petition presented to the Resident in Waziristan at Miran- shah by representatives of the Tori Khel, Mohmit Khel and Kabul Khel sections of the Utmanzai Darwesh Khel Wazirs on the 12th May 1922. Regarding the consolidation of the Tochi Valley we, the whole body of Maliks and Elders named at the end of this petition who have been chosen to represent our tribe, beg - to present the following petition :— When the Resident in Waziristan interviewed our full jirga on the 9th May, he pointed out that the dark times of war and fighting had passed and the day of peace and prosperity had dawned again. Intercourse and friendly relations had been restored with His Majesty the Amir of Afghanistan, and the time had come for every one to set his house in order and to take this opportunity of protecting and safeguarding himself from the dangers and weaknesses which threaten him from outside and from within. The Tochi, which was not in too satisfactory a state at present, should there fore be made secure against any possibility of disturbance from outside or inside, and we should see that we ourselves caused no injury to the lives and property of the subjects of the neighbouring friendly Government. The Resident consulted the opinion of our joint jirga and asked us to discuss fully the question of strengthen ing the Tochi and to make suitable suggestions. After three or four days of thorough discussion we have come to the following conclusion. It is obvious that the Southern and Northern borders of the Tochi Agency are the dangerous ones. We deal with each separately. (A) Razmak, the Khaisora and Sen are the dangerous portions of the Southern part of the Agency as it adjoins Mahsud country. Most of the troubles of Bannu and this Agency are the work of that noxious tribe. These criminal people use Razmak and the Khaisora as routes to raid into British territory, and a certain number of foolish and wicked Tori Khel and Moh mit Khel Wazirs join them. The Mahsuds are however the real originators of the trouble and if their misdeeds are checked with a strong hand these few bad charac ters among the Tori Khel and Mohmit Khel will certainly give up their habit of helping in these offences. The total prevention of such serious occurrences is however extremely difficult. It must be admitted that our present annual allow ances are paid to us for our territorial responsibility and we cannot deny that we are responsible so far as lies within our power. Though we continually try to fulfil this duty, it is impossible, however hard we try, to check these Mahsuds entirely. We, the Tori Khel and Mohmit Khel, who are the owners of these parts, are very scattered tribes, and the majority of us live in Sheratalla, Kaitu, Spinwam }572 N - w - F - PROVINCE—NORTH WAZTRTSTAN AGENCY— Wazirs —NO, IX—1922. Darweshta and other out of the way places. In the Khaisora and Razmak there are not enough people to resist the Mahsuds. Moreover the Tochi road has now out us in two and thus further weakened us and increased our misfortunes. It is due to such unfortunate circumstances that the Mahsuds have now actually got, their teeth into certain of our possessions, such as Razmak, Shawal, and others and the danger is that these places will go the way of Badar and Tauda China which the Mahsuds seized from the Wazirs in the past. Apart from these acts of aggression, the Wazirs and Mahsuds have been at feud for generations and until the Mahsuds' grasping greed is curtailed we shall always be in danger of losing Razmak and Shawal, etc. The Mahsud is undoubtedly the common enemy and antagonist of the Wazir and the Government, and in our opinion we must make a combined attempt to save ourselves from this common threat, and must each help the other to defeat the common enemy. As regards the matter under immediate discussion we propose that as allies we should strengthen the Razmak and Khaisora border, cut at the root of Mahsud mis doings and close every hole to their aggression. We believe that the only means of doing this is for Government to build a strong fort on Razmak and garrison it adequately with regular troops or Militia and make a broad metalled road for motors from the Tochi to Razmak. For one thing, this proposed occupation will prevent the passage of Mahsud gangs, and the new position will be a direct blow at the very heart of the Mahsuds. If any trouble should ever arise between Gov ernment and the Mahsuds it will be perfectly easy from Razmak to break the neck of this pestilent tribe. In the second place our property and possessions in Raz mak, the Khaisora, Shawal, Sham and elsewhere will be permanently safe from Mahsud aggressions. In pursuance of our common object we therefore authorise the British Government to build a road and fort in our country, and we have, of our own accord, ventured to make this proposal. If Government considers our proposals suitable to their own interests, and wishes to make a road and fort in our country, the following conditions should be laid down, and we promise to abide by them. 1. In compensation for the new occupation fresh allowances of a suitable amount should be paid to these sections of the Tori Khel and Mohmit Khel in whose territory the new road and fort are situated, and should be distributed pro- portionately among these legally entitled to them. We shall decide the method of distribution in consultation with the Resident and the Political Agent, Tochi. 2. I he right to take contracts for building the road and fort shall belong solely to the tribe in whose limits the work is situated ; no one else will have any claim to hav c a share in them without the permission of the tribe concerned, except as a partner of the rightful owner, or when the Political Agent for some special reason gives permission. 1 he distribution of contracts, fixing of rates, and arrange ments for carrying out the work will lie with the Political Agent. The rates pre- \ ailing in the nearest parts of the Mahsud country will be applicable.X.-W. F. PROVINCE—NORTH WAZIRTSTAN AGEN C Y— Wazirs K7Q —NO. IX—1922. 3. Particularly in the country newly occupied by the road and fort and generally in the whole of Razmak and the Khaisora Government will acquire no rights of ownership m lands, jungles or mines. They may however use water for drinking purposes without payment, and may conduct it from one place to another, pro vided the interests of the real owners are not prejudiced. 4. In this newly opened tract of the Khaisora and Razmak regular law will not be introduced, nor will police be posted, nor any dues imposed, nor will any intervention be made in cases dealing with women. But to ensure peace and quiet it is essential that Government's hold on the country should be a firm hold. Our agreement is on the understanding that Government will only intervene in cases affecting the peace of the country and will decide these by the custom of the country and by Shariat, where this is not contrary to justice, equity and good conscience. 5. Suitable compensation will be paid for any damage done in making the road or fort to villages, mills, burial grounds, cultivated land, irrigation works, or forests of any value. 6. Government will be entitled to keep any number of regular troops or Militia in the fort as occasion demands. 7. A sufficient number of Khassadars shall be enlisted to protect the road and give assistance to the garrison of troops or Militia. If this is approved we shall decide as to the method of enlistment and numbers of Khassadars in consultation with the Resident and the Political Agent. It is clearly understood that if the road and fort are not sanctioned, Khassadars will not be enlisted, since without the presence of troops or Militia Khassadars in Razmak or the Khaisora would be use less and a mere source of danger. In fact neither should Khassadars alone be enlisted, nor should troops or Militia be on Razmak if there are no Khassadars. 8. To effect the occupation of Razmak Government will be entitled to move any number of troops they think fit through our country. We shall make no objec tion and we shall ourselves take up the contracts for supplies and transport. If any survey party or engineering party wishes to go to Razmak for a preliminary survey or reconnaissance, strong escort shall be provided by our tribe, and the whole of the Tori Khel and Mohmit Khel will be responsible for their safety and comfort. The escort shall be paid and reasonable rate of wages shall be fixed. (B) The other side of the Tochi Valley from which most offences in this Agency and im Bannu district are committed is the North side, stretching from Lawara to Bannu on the East and Thai on the North. Its most dangerous part is the Spin- warn line between Idak and Thai. The offences committed through this tract originate chiefly in Khost, and during the last 2 or 3 years of war with Afghanistan this activity of Khostwals has increased. Now, however, that peace and friendship have been made with the Afghan Government, it is to be hoped that they will set Khost in order. We think that the proper cure to be prescribed for troubles in that direction is the old one of occupying Spinwam. This is no fresh matter requir ing much discussion, but the following points may be noticed.574 N-W. F. PROVINCE—NORTH WAZ1R1STAN AGENCY— Wazin —NO. IX—1922. (1) When occupation of this tract is deemed advisable it should be carried out with our knowledge and in consultation with us. (2) The allowances now paid to our tribe for the Spinwam routes are insuffi cient and should be duly increased and divided proportionately among the tribes in whose territories the road and forts are located. If this is sanctioned, we shall discuss the method of distribution with the Resident and Political Agent, (3) The method of settling private and inter-tribal cases among the people of this country will be the same as is mentioned above for the Khaisora and the terms of condition No. 4 above regarding the settlement of private cases and regarding taxes, etc., will be applicable to Spinwam. (4) Government will be entitled to build new roads and forts in the Spinwam tract besides the old ones, and suitable compensation will be paid to the owners. The description of damage given in condition No. 5 for the Khaisora may be taken as applying also to Spinwam. Government will also be entitled to locate either regular troops, Militia, or Khassadars in the Spinwam tract. (5) Government is entitled to widen and metal the old roads in this tract and make them fit for motors, but we shall take over every kind of building contract and no outsider will have any claim on them, unless the Political Agent or we ourselves give special permission. We shall later consult the Political Agent about the distribution of contracts and fixing of rates. If troops or Militia occupy Spinwam, the supply contracts should be given to us. (6) Whether troops or Militia garrison Spinwam it is necessary for the peace and safety of these routes that an adequate number of Khassadars be enlisted. Without them there can be no satisfactory settlement of the country. If this is sanctioned, we shall later discuss with the Political Agent the method of enlist ment. (Here follow the signatures.) Reply given by the Resident in Waziristan to the petition presented by the Tori Khel, Mohmit Khel and Kabul Khel sections of the Utmanzai Darwesh Khel Wazirs. Government ha\ e no desire to introduce into your country a regular adminis tration such as exists in British India with land revenue, regular law and a police force. Government are anxious that you should remain undisturbed in full pos session of the lands of your ancestors with undiminished proprietary rights in the lands, forests and mines. The object of Government in affecting a new agreement with you is to enable you to control your own tribe and consolidate it against exter nal aggression so that your tribesmen should neither commit offences against Gov ernment themselves nor allow others to commit them across your territory. In view of the treaty concluded with His Majesty the Amir of Afghanistan, you will beN.-W. F. PHOVINCE- -JNOll TH VVAZIRI STAN AGENCY— Wazirs —NO. IX—1922. 575 expected to refrain from committing offences in Afghan territory. In return for the material help which Government offer they wish you to police yourselves with i % as little interference from outside as possible. Both as regards the Khaisora trac« o 1(it to the South of the Tochi and as regards the Kurram and Kaitu tracts to the North ^ the same principles will apply, namely, that when Government decide to take' cognisance of any cases or disputes among you, either at your own request or in J the lnterest of general peace and security, such cases will be decided equitably in accordance with tribal custom or Muhammadan law and that Government will not interfere unduly in women cases. li. Government will however exercise their ancient existing right to enforce the «| regular law, if necessary, against persons who commit ofiences in British India or the protected areas in the Kurram and Tochi Agencies. Government are aware of your inability to consolidate your tribal organization in the Khaisora, Kaitu and Kurram tracts and are therefore ready to consider your suggestions that you s,| should be supported by the forces of Government, either regular or irregular. Government also accept your request that a suitable number of Khassadars shall liite enterta i n ed at Government expense. The question of constructing roads from Inr anc ^ ^ rom I^ak to Razmak and of constructing a fort on Razmak are receiving favourable consideration and Government are willing to grant you in creased allowances in view of your increased responsibilities. But you must under stand that these allowances are closely bound up with the maintenance of the Khassadar forces and both are conditional on your good behaviour and hearty co-operation, not merely in protecting the roads but also in controlling offenders. Government agree with you that, as regards the Khaisora, Government forcee will be useless without Khassadars in addition and that Khassadars would be useless and even dangerous without Government forces in support. As is invariab ly the rule in such cases. Government will offer the contracts for constructing any forts and roads to local Maliks in the first instance, prescribing rates which shall be similar to the rates sanctioned for similar work in Mahsud country. As regards any damage caused to villages, mills, burial grounds, cultivated lands, irrigation works and forests, suitable compensation will be assessed by the Political Agent and paid promptly. Any other disturbance of ancient rights of appreciable value will be paid for. Government shall be free to make use of exist ing streams and springs for the supply of water to its forces and for the construc tion of roads and buildings and shall be liable to pay compensation for the same only if material loss is caused to the rightful owners of such water rights. When making surveys for these roads, Government will call on the local tribes to supply escorts at suitable rates for the protection of surveying parties. Similarly, when construction work begins, the protection of Government staffs, contractors and labourers and their camps shall, as far as possible, be entrusted to local tribes men, unless such protection appears to be inadequate. When Government forces are located in Razmak, Spinwam and Shewa, if contracts are given out for the supply of local products such as timber, mattings, grass, hay, bhoosa, cattle, XI 2 q576 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—NORTH WAZIRISTAN AGENCY—TFazirs —NOS. IX AND X—1922. sheep and goats, fowls and eggs, preference will be given to local tribesmen at reasonable rates, provided a regular supply can be ensured. Similarly if hired transport is required contracts for the same will be offered in the first instance to the tribes of the Tochi, No. X. T ranslation of an A greement made by the ] VT at)da K hel D arwesh K hel on the 26th August 1922. We fully understand and accept the total amount and internal distribution of the new increased maliki and tribal allowances. The conditions and obligations on which the old allowances were based are fully described in our tribal agreement made on 10th July 1908, and have now been read out to us. Our whole tribe rely on and agree to the renewal of agreement, and we confirm and accept all the conditions and regulations without reserve. The agreement of 10th July 1908 may be considered as renewed and reaffirmed, and the following condition is added to it;— We shall be responsible that nobody from our tribe will commit any offence in Government territory, and that no ill-disposed person or persons, of whatever tribe or section, will be allowed to live in our territory, or to pass through our limits to commit any offence in Government territory. During the last 14 years the constitution and organisation of the frontier tribes has, according to the law of nature, undsrgone a vast change. The universal use of new weapons of war, the arms trade from the Persian Gulf and Persian Tur- kistan, and the institution of rifle factories on various frontiers, have produced an important and obvious change in the war-like armament of the tribes. More over this age of enlightenment has inspired the frontier tribes with a certain amount of wisdom. Although there is still something to be said for the old methods em ployed by the great tribes in controlling their members, stopping internal and external misdemeanours and fulfilling their obligations, they have nevertheless been weakened by the changes referred to above. To repair this deficiency and to strengthen our hands satisfactorily we consider that the Government should seek a new method of helping us effectively. Hence our proposal for the appointment of a tribal force, the Khassadars. By the grant of such effective assistance our personal relations and authority will acquire strength and support, and we shall be capable of bearing with tase and with confidence the burden of our obligations to the Government, and we shall be able without difficulty to carry out and fulfil the duties of our office. Even if it be considered inadvisable to grant this request, we and our tribe will abide by and be bound by the conditions of our agreejnent,N.-W. P. PROVINCE-NORTH WAZJRISTAN AOBNCY-WW* —NOS.

Having paid the above amount of fine, and having restored the four horses of the Government which were within our country, we solicit pardon for past offences, and freely and sincerely make the following promises for the future :— 1st. That we shall never give shelter or assistance to any individual, indivi duals, or tribe who after committing treason against the British State seek shelter or assistance in our country, but, on the other hand, we will do our best to carry out the orders of the Government as may be issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Bannu in regard to such man, men, or tribe. 2nd. That our tribe shall never be guilty of the offence of rebellion against the British Government. 3rd. —That no man of our tribe shall ever commit any heinous offence such as murder, plunder, burglary, etc., within British territory, and that though we cannot be responsible for our entire tribe in regard to thefts, yet we shall endeavour our utmost to retain the thieves among our tribes, and if at any time it is found that stolen property is brought into our country by any one of our tribe from British territory, we shall have either the stolen property restored or the whole tribe will be responsible for its value, 4th. —That we shall never receive any property stolen from British territory by any other tribe, nor will we give shelter or aid to the culprit, and if any one bring such property into our country, we will, if possible, restore it without ran som, or if not, we will never allow the perpetrator to remain in our country, and if the property be still in our country, we are responsible for either the restoration or payment of it.s value.ttHlmm 58U N -- w - V- PKOViNCE—NOiITU WAZ1KJSTAN AUENCY Daurs NO.

The tribes under the control of the Political Agent, South Waziristan, are the Mahsuds: part of the Ahmadzai clan of the Darwesh Khel Wazirs: and the Ghilzai nomads who have settled in the Wana plain. There is also a settlement of Urmars—a tribe of uncertain origin, with a language and customs of their own—at Kaniguram in Mahsud country. 1. MAHSUDS. The Mahsud Wazir tribe consists of three clans—the Bahlolzai, Alizai and Shaman Khel, numbering about 5,000, 5,000 and 2,700 fighting men respectively. For many years the Mahsuds remained hostile to the British Govern ment, and lawless bands, recruited from among the tribesmen living nearest to the British border, constantly plundered and harried neigh bouring British territory, particularly along the Tank border, which was not under direct British management. The conduct of British relations with the Mahsuds, and all powers of political and magisterial jurisdiction, were in the hands of the Nawab of Tank until 1873, when these powers were withdrawn from the Nawab, and Tank was amalga mated with the Dera Ismail Khan district. The Wana (now South Waziristan) Agency was established in 1895. In March 1860 the Mahsuds attacked Tank, but were heavily repulsed, and a military expedition inflicted severe punishment on them in April and May. The tribe at first refused to submit, but in March 1861 the Maliks came in to sue for peace. Terms were offered, but were refused; but in June they again came in: and, whereas they had previously been required to make peace as one tribe, they were now permitted to do so separately, clan by clan. Three separate Agreements (No. I) were accordingly taken from the Shaman Khel, Alizai and Bahlolzai clans. In August 1861, however, the murder of a party of grass-cutters led to the tribe being excluded from British territory until October, when blood money in accordance with the fifth article of the Agreement, amounting in this case to lis. 4,500, was paid. The peace, thus tem porarily restored, did not last, and murders and robberies in British territory were of frequent occurrence. The only punishment inflicted was exclusion of the tribe from trading in the Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan districts, which had been imposed upon the Bahlolzai in 1864 and extended to the other clans later. This took a long time to produce any effect, but it did so at length in 187-°), when the Shaman Khel made full submission and signed an Agreement (No. II): an example which was followed by the Bahlolzai (No. Ill) in 1874.N.-W. F. PROVINCE-SOUTH WAZTRISTAN AGENCY— Mahsuds. 533 The abolition of tlie 4 middleman ' Nawab of Tank in 1873, and arrangements made in 1876 with the Bhitannis and others {see Part X) for safeguarding the passes on their frontier, rapidly reduced Mahsud crime and made it more easy to deal with. From August 1877 to March 1878 the whole tribe was under blockade. On the 1st January 1879 a lashkar of about 3,000 Mahsuds made a sudden attack on the town of Tank, which they sacked and burned : on the 19th January three British villages weie attacked: and throughout 1879 and 1880 Mahsud raids were of constant occurrence. A rigorous blockade, instituted in 1879, had little effect: and in April 1881 a military expedition entered the Mahsud country. In July the tribe submitted and accepted the Govern ment terms, which included the surrender of the ringleaders of the attack on Tank, and a fine of lis. 30,000. The blockade was then raised. In January 1890 the three Mahsud clans accepted (No. IV) the Government offer ol service in protecting the road through the Gromal Pass. The annual allowances fixed on this occasion amounted to Rs. 30,456, in addition to the old service allowance of Rs. 19,000: and personal emoluments totalling Rs. 833 monthly were granted to the leading Maliks. In 1890-91 a railway survey was carried out in the Gomal Pass, the Mahsuds behaving well throughout the operations of the survey party. In 1892, largely as the result of interference by Afghan emissaries, Mahsud offences were numerous: and in 1893 they were even more so. In November 1894, during the Indo-Afghan boundary demarcation operations, a party of 500 Mahsuds made a night attack on an escort encamped at W ana, and inflicted considerable damage before being ejected with heavy losses. On the assumption that the whole tribe was uot implicated in this attack, negotiations continued with the Mahsuds, on whom terms were imposed in December. These, however, they failed to carry out; whereupon, in the same month, a force entered their country and compelled them to comply. Steps were taken to render control over Waziristan more effective: and the allowances paid to the Mahsud Maliks were re-distributed and their total amount raised to Rs. 61,548. The Mahsuds took no part in the disturbances of 1897; but in 1898 there was a recrudescence of offences which continued until the autumn of 1900, when the Mahsud jirga was informed that, as the Maliks had failed to control the tribe, the allowances would in future be distributed to the whole tribe and not to the Maliks: that a fine of Rs. 1,00,000 had been imposed and that, until this was paid, allowances would be withheld and the whole tribe placed under blockade. Payments were made regularly at first; but in the summer of 1901, they practically ceased and offences again became numerous. In the winter of 1901-02 an expeditionary force entered the Mahsud country and inflicted heavy084 N - vv - F - I'lWVl^CE-SOUTH WAZIRISTAN AG EN C ¥—MuhsUds punishment, whereupon the tribe offered complete submission, ^h' was accepted, terms were imposed, and the blockade was raised f March 1902. In the following month an Agreement (No. V) was taken from the combined jirga of the whole tribe, and the grant of allowances was resumed, each of the three clans receiving one third of a total annual allowance of lis. 54,000, in supersession of that ffranted in 1895. In 1903 a further sum of Rs. 9,000 was sanctioned, for distri- bution among the leading men who actually represented the tribe in its dealings with Government. In 1904-05 three British officers were murdered, two by Mahsud sepoys, and the third by an ex-sepoy of the Militia. It was subse- quently ascertained that these three murders were not isolated acts of fanaticism, but were the results of a conspiracy: and the tribe was fined lis. Jo,000 and their allowances were suspended. They were also re quired to surrender five men of their tribe suspected of the murders Four of these were unconditionally surrendered, and security was eiven for the surrender of the fifth, who had fled from Mahsud limits, in tie event of his return. In 1911 a Mahsud lashkar invested the Sarwakai Militia post, but dispersed on the assembly of troops in the vicinity. In April 1914 Major Dodd, Political Agent, Wana, and two other British officers were inurdered at, Tank by a Mahsud orderly who was himself shot dead by the Frontier Constabulary. As this act of murder appeared also to be I he result of a conspiracy among the tribe, -they were called upon to surrender the conspirators and the near relatives of the murderer, and a I allowances were suspended pending compliance. A series of 0 ls followed in 1915, and in April 1917 a Mahsud lashkar again invested Sarwakai post. In a sortie by the garrison the British com- mandant and two Indian officers were killed, and 33 men of the Southern U azinstan Militia killed or wounded, a number of rifles being lost. ns unexpected success was followed by a number of serious offences and attacks on troops, including the capture of no less thau 400 rifles. mi itai\ foice enteied Mahsud country in June and inflicted very ae\ere punishment, resulting in submission and acceptance of the Gov- ..ininent tei ms, on the Jnd July. Government in return pledged them selves not to build any new posts or roads in Mahsud country, so long as tie in k bcluned well. All Mahsud detenus were also released. In August a joint Agreement (No. VI) was taken from the tribe: and their owances, which had been under suspension since 1914, were restored. . . r ^' , . e nil ^ rea ' v 0 f the Afghan War in 1919, and the evacuation of the 1 i iti.i posts, produced great excitement among the Mahsuds, who invested ,7 andola and several frontier police posts in the Dera Ismail Khan district, and committed a series of raids in British territory. ie immaix teiins were offered to the tribe, which were refused: andlis k ■ N.-W.

Severe fighting ensued, especially in January 1920: and the force, after inflict ing heavy punishment, reached Kaniguram, in the heart of the Mahsud country, on the 1st March 1920. By the summer of that year all the Mahsuds had made settlements with Government except part of the two most important divisions of the Bahlolzai clan—the Aimal Khel and Nana Khel. Of the former, the Abdullai sub-division, and the Shubi Ivhel section of the Nazar Khel sub-division: and, of the latter, the Jalal Khel sub-di\ision and the Abdur Rahman sub-section of the Haibat Khel sub-division : remained recalcitrant. 1921 was a ^ear of forays and raids, and of the wearing down of stubborn resistance on the part of the recalcitrant tribesmen. In September the Abdullai made overtures for peace: and in November the policy of Government was announced (No. VI1) to a tribal jirga in Tank. Ihe withdiawal of regular troops from Wana in December caused a temporary relapse 111 the situation, and a recrudescence of intensive raiding; but in July 1922 a full jirga, except the Abdullai, Jalal Khel and Abdui liahman KiieJ, presented a joint petition, accompanied by separate petitions from each of the three clans (No. VIII), for peace: and to these an answer (No. IX) was returned by the Resident. This included the announcement of an increase of the annual tribal allowances to lis. 1,08,000. During 1922 aerial operations were undertaken against tlie Abdullai, Jalal Khel and Abdur Rahman Khel: and in February 1928 a military force inflicted punishment on the Abdullai. In the same month terms were offered (No. X) to the Jalal Khel, and the Abdullai presented a petition (No. XIj accepting the terms imposed upon them, which were confirmed in a reply (No. Xll) made to them on the following day. In March 1923 an Announcement (No. XI11) of the future policy of Government, particularly as regards the construction and protection of roads, was made to a representative jirga of all the Mahsuds except the Jalal Khel, with whom terms were being made separately. The settlement with the Jalal Khel was completed in May. There are two divisions of the Alizai clan—the Shabi Khel and Mauzai: and the latter has three sub-divisions, one of which is the 1'alli Khel. In consequence of offences committed by the Guri Khel and Garrarai sub-sections of the Talli Khel, their jirgas were called upon to fulfil certain terms. The Guri Khel refused to comply, and aerial action was taken against them, resulting in their submission in October 1923. In September 1924 the three Mahsud clans jointly undertook (No. XIV) to guarantee ihe safety of the Sararogha-Razmak road : and a separate undertaking (No. XV) to (he same effect was taken from the Shabi Khel division of the Alizai.580 n -W. F. PROVINCE-SOUTH WAZIRISTAN AGENCY Mahsuds. During 1924-25 the Abdur Ealiman Kliel were responsible for a number of serious offences, and aerial action was taken against them This had the desired effect, and an Agreement (No. XVI) was tak from them in May 1925. In September 1927 the Shabi Ivhel gave an Agreement (No. XVII) for the protection of the lower Shaktn trade route. Numerous offences by the Nekzan Khel, Giga Khel and Kikarai includ- ing four murders and the kidnapping of two labourers from the Sarwakai- Wana road led to the aerial bombardment of Nekzan Khel and Giga Kkel villages on the 15th and 16th November 1928 and ground action by Scouts against the Kikarai. This action resulted in a speedy settlement, the Nekzan Khel paying lis. 4,000 blood money and Us. 3,046 and two •■50.3 rifles as fine, the Giga Khel a fine of lis. 1,640 and the Kikarai blood money of Es. 1,500 and a fine of Rs. 1,500. On the 14i h June 1929 Jiostan, a Shnigi Khassadar Havildar, opened fire near Tauda China on a Military Staff car and killed Lieutenant Stephen, R.A., and Assistant Surgeon Cabral. The whole tribal machinery was set in motion to secure Bostan's arrest but he managed to escape into Afghanistan. A fine of Us. 10,000 was extracted from the Shingis and Bostan and his companions were declared outlaw. ^ On the 23rd July 1929 the entire Mahsud jirga signed an Agreement (No. XV III) regarding the construction of the Tauda China-Wana road in so far as it runs through Mahsud limits. 1 he campaign of Civil Disobedience set on foot in the districts of the North-West Frontier Province had its reaction in Mahsud territory. Several agitators visited Kaniguram and other places and the hostile element among the Mahsuds declared a heavy fine to be recovered from any Mahsud betraying such agitators. The Garrarai betrayed two Hindu agitaiois w ho weie arrested near Bibizai. This led to the destruction of Sega, a Garrarai village, by Mahsud hostiles on the 31st May 1930. The hostiles were subjected to aerial bombardment. This was followed bv a quiescent period of a month, but further agitation led to the investment of Sararogha Scouts' Post on the 7th July 1930 by a lashkar drawn from practically all Mahsud sections. A stout defence put up by the garrison of Hie post combined with aerial bombardment of lashkars assembling around Sararogha and villages of hostile sections compelled the lashkars to disperse. In the meantime troops were moved into Ladha and up the Baddar Valley and by the beginning of August all the hostile sections concerned had submitted. A final settlement was made with the Mah suds on the 5th November 1930 whereby a fine of Us. 46,677 and 52 nfies was recovered from the offending sections.111 W, irttf- ffl iS- N.-JV. F. PllOVlNOi!:—SOUTH WAZIRISTAN AGENCY 2. WAZIRS. There are two divisions of the Ahmadzai clan of the Darwesh Khel Wazirs—the Shin Khel and Kalu Khel. The Shin Khel have three sub divisions—Umarzai, Sirki Khel and Hathi Khel. Of these, about half of the Sirki Khel live in and near Wana; and the Idal Khel, one of the sections of the Hathi Khel, have settlements in Wana and Shakai. The Kalu Khel have two sub-divisions—Sperkai, some of whose sections have summer settlements in Shakai, and Nasruddin Khel, consisting of two sections, the Bomi Khel and Shadi Khel. Of these, the Bomi Khel live at Wana and the Shadi Khel are scattered from the Kohat border to Wana, some of the sections of the latter living at Shakai. The settlement concluded with certain sections of the Utmanzai clan in April 1874 (see Part VIII) included the Khojal Khel sub-section of the Shadi Khel and the Taji Khel sub-section of the Bomi Khel Ahmadzai. In January 1879 the Zilli Khel sub-section of the Bomi Khel, excited by the Mahsud attack on Tank, seized a small British outpost, but were soon reduced to submission. In 1890, on the opening of the Gomal Pass for traffic, the Sirki Khel, Taji Khel and Zilli Khel accepted responsibility for guarding and keeping open the pass, and were granted annual allowances of Bs. 10,980. In 1894 Wana was occupied with the acquiescence of the Sirki Khel and Bomi Khel, and the Khojal Khel sub-section of the Shadi Khel; all of whom, as well as some of the Shadi Khel sub-sections living in Shakai, received allowances, totalling Bs. 3,612 a year, for services in Wana. During the Mahsud blockade and subsequent fighting in 1901-02, the Ahmadzai Wazirs gave little trouble; but the Mahsud success at Sarwakai in April 1917 produced unrest and led to a plot by the Taji Khel to capture the Wana tahsil. This was frustrated by the receipt of timely information, and the ringleaders received heavy sentences. When in May 1919, during the Afghan War, Wana and the South Waziristan Militia posts east of Murtaza were evacuated, the Wana Wazirs joined in attacking the Militia force retiring from Wana. During the subsequent months they engaged in an intensive raiding campaign into British districts, their most notable exploit being the burning and looting of Gomal town in the Bera Ismail Khan district. They also took part in the severe fighting that occurred in January' 1920 during the Mahsud expedition of 1919-20. Soon after the evacuation of Wana, Afghan troops occupied the deserted post. Preliminary terms were announced to the Wana azirs in October 1920; but, owing to continued intrigue by Afghan emissaries,588 N ' W - F - PROVINCE—80TTTTT WAZTRISTAN AGENCY—TTWs and Crhilzai. they did not comply, and military action was taken against them in November 1920, together with the imposition of a blockade. The re- occnpation of VVana improved the situation, and in August 1921 the Government terms were complied with and the blockade was raise/ In November 1921 announcements were made to the Wana Wazirs (No, XIX), and to the Ahmadzai Wazirs of Shakai (No. XX) who had also complied with the Government terms. hi December 1921 the regular troops evacuated Wana and were re placed by Khassadars. This gave rise to the belief that further retire- ments were intended, and the Khassadar garrison of Wana was attacked l'\ a hostile lashkar, which was dispersed by aerial operations. \u 1922 increased annual allowances, totalling lis. 25,260, were sanctioned for the Ahmadzai Wazirs of the South Waziristan Agency. In February 1923 aerial action was taken against the Taji Khel, as a pmiishinent for a long series of outrages committed since 1919. The Gangi Khel sub-section of the Bomi Khel had been included in the settlement of November 1921, but had committed numerous offences, chiefly m the Kohat district, during 1922 and 1923. In November 1923 Major h inn is, Political Agent, Zhob, was murdered by a party of Zilli Khel who had been domiciled in Afghanistan, assisted by two Shiranis I he Wana Wazirs effected the arrest of the two latter, but failed to capture the Zilh Khel offenders. In August 1924 the Political Naib 1 ehs,ldar was murdered by his Taji Khel Khassadar escort. As a punishment for this offence, Rs. 10,000 were deducted from the allowances of the Wana Wazirs and two months' Khassadari pay, anionn I mg to Us. 33,000, was stopped. In January 192G the Gangi Ivhel and m February 1926 the Taji Khel who had been consistently hostile since 1919, made a settlement with Government. In January 1926 the Khonia Khel sub-section of the Shadi Khel murdered three men of the 4/5th Mahratta Rifles inside the Baiinu antonment, and carried away their rifles. The rifles were recovered, and the Khonia Khel paid a fine of Rs. 3,000. Wana was re-occupied by regular troops in November 1929.

We most respectfully beg to represent that, on being summoned by the Govern ment (Sarkar), we, all the Maliks of each of the three sections of the Mahsuds, have presented themselves at Appozai. Your Honour has informed us that tho Government intends to pacify the Gomal Pass and establish communication through it with Zhob and elsewhere, and for ensuring the safety of these routes and maintaining peace in the country, proposes to grant us pay and allowances and entertain us in their service. We are greatly pleased with this arrangement and willingly accept the pay and allowances Government has graciously been pleased to fix for our tribe, in return for which we, in future, hold ourselves responsible for the safety and protection of the road, and will cheerfully comply with any orders that the Government may be pleased to give, and will always remain united to, and 011 friendly terms with, the Sarkar. We have distributed among ourselves the amount Government has been pleased to fix for service by common consent and according to tribal usage. We trust that in future Government will regard us as their own subjects and treat us with kindness, and we, maliks and our nominees, levies, will always be present when required and ready to do the Government service. In whatever places Government may be pleased to fix posts for our nominees, levies, they will remain there without objection and serve the Government faithfully. {Here follow the signatures.) No. V. Agreement by the Mashud Jirga , dated the 5th April 1902. Government has been pleased to grant allowances to the Mashud tribe. Therefore, in consideration of these allowances, we, the full tribal jirga, com pletely representing the whole Mashud tribe, hereby bind the whole tribe to faith fully abide by the following conditions ; for compelling the observance of which,we. the tribal jirga, are responsible : we,the Mashud tribe, will be loyal to Government ; we will be of good conduct and commit no offences in areas occupied by Govern ment, that is to say, districts like Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, the Sheranni country, or Wana or the Tochi or roads like the Gumal and other trade routes ; or against Government interests in any way ; it is the duty of the tribe to control and keep in order all and every member of our tribe and all the Mashuds are jointly respon sible for every Mashud without exception within our limits and for any others who reside in our country ; this responsibility is full joint tribal or sectional responsi bility as Government chooses, coupled, if Government pleases, with the punsh -598 N -W.

Announcement made to the Mahsuds on the 5th November 1921. Preamble.—Owing to their sincere desire for peace and the betterment and free development of the tribes on the lines of their cherished institutions, the Govern ment of India have decided to announce the following generous lines of policy by which they propose to be guided in the future in regard to the occupation and administration of Mahsud country. (1) Though it is the intention of Government to remain for so long as it pleases in occupation of the Mahsud country, it has no intention of introducing into that country the regular administration of a settled district but will admin ister it on tribal lines in accordance with tribal customs and usage. (2) Allowances and other privileges will be granted as Government may deem proper having due regard to services rendered and especially to the degree in which the co-operation of Maliks and tribesmen is forthcoming for the restoration and maintenance of law and order. (3) The conditions for the payment of allowances will be (a) To the Maliks for their services in actively helping the Khassadar scheme, (6) To the Maliks for the maintaining of order in their sections. Those sections which have cleared their account and such individuals as have rendered conspicuous service will be per mitted to count their allowances from the date of this announcement. (4) Proprietary rights of Mahsuds in all produce will be respected, but the Government reserves to itself the right to levy after the next five years as the due of the Supreme Government a light toll in kind whether on flocks or otherwise. (5) No land revenue whatever will be demanded for the next twenty years, the matter to be further considered on the expiry of that period. mm(jQg N.-W. F. J'JIOV1 iNCE— SUUTli VVAZllUSTAW AGENCY- -Alahsuds —NUS. VII—1921 AND VIII—1922. (6) There will be no interference in women cases which shall be settled by Mahsud jirga when Mahsuds only are concerned, and when Mahsuds and another tribe arc concerned, by joint jirga of Mahsuds and that tribe. (7) No court fees whatever will be levied for the next five years, thereafter for the succeeding years an eight anna court fee will be levied : the matter to be further considered on expiry of that period. (8) No forced enlistment will be imposed. {[)) All cases will be dealt with by jirga except offences committed against the Government or Government servants or in the Government settlements. T. G. Mathbson, Major-General, Oomtnanding, Wazirislan Force, Novonhcr 5lli, 1921. No. VIII. Petition of all three Mahsuds , dated the 14th July 1922. We all the Mahsud Maliks from Mandana kach to Sigha unanimously beg to say, that not a single man of ' Nekidars ' will cause any loss to the Government. If unfortunately any one did so, we would be responsible for that. If any one will be proved guilty, he shall be handed over to the Government, by us the maliks without any objection. If within our area any hostile Abdullai or Jalal Khel will commit mischief, we will help against him in -every possible way. 2. \\ e will be responsible for the new incidents which may occur, particularly in return and affecting release of Hindus or Muhammedans, who may be kidnapped from British territory. o. We will produce the offenders for their trial ; however any one may run away and may not return within five years, and in the meanwhile might not have settled with the Government, all his landed property should be confiscated. 4. \\ e may not be arrested on saying of our enemies, nor we may be troubled. Enquiries concerning to the outlaws should generally be made from Maliks and they may not be arrested if possible. 5. Government should be kind enough to award us a written ' Sanad ' as to the effect, that our people including the maliks will not be disgraced. If any enquiry is necessary first the Maliks should be summoned. In case of non-com pliance with the above terms, we would be liable of any treatment which Govern ment thinks suitable. 6. 1 hat the Government will give us land compensation and will as far as possible arrange for the irrigation of our lands.N.-VV. i&lt;\ i'liOVlNCE—SOUTH WAZIRISTAN AGENCY—!/ ahsuds ou , —NO.

P etition of the S haman K hel J ikga. 1. ^e trust that we shall in future be treated separately and distinctly from the other two sections of the Mahsuds. 2. As far as lies in our power our responsibility shall be complete and undis puted within oui limits, as far as concerns village areas. As regards unoccupied areas where there are no habitations, Government should assume responsibility themselves as long as it remains in occupation. If and when Government withdraws then we are ready to accept responsibility for the unoccupied areas also, within our respected limits. We shall then be prepared in every way to help Government as stated in the opening position of this paragraph. 3. We, the Shaman Khel, are responsible jointly and individually for all offences ; that is to say, in the first instance, the sub-section concerned will be responsible ; after that the responsibility will lie on the next larger tribal unit and finally the Shaman Khel section will be responsible. 4. If any one belonging to the Shaman Khel section leaves the section and takes shelter elsewhere, then the section which gives him shelter shall be in every way responsible for his behaviour. And in the same way, if any one comes from another section and takes refuge with us, then we shall be responsible for his behaviour. 5. When a sub-section or a village is charged with an offence, in the first in stance the enquiries connected with the offence and demand for satisfaction shall be made through the malik concerned and then in case of default of satisfaction, all steps in the way of arrest etc., may be taken. But we ask that, as far as pos sible, the maliks should not be arrested. Such proceeding should be carried out by the Political Staff, and in the case of absconders and refugees from British territory, we shall attempt in the first in stance to have the settlement effected through the instrumentality of the Political Agent. If we fail in this, we shall either be responsible for his behaviour or shall turn him out of our territory. 6. If any Shaman Khel is killed by any Mahsud while doing his manifest duty in the service of Government then we trust that Government will bestow such a sum in compensation to the heirs of the deceased as may enable them to main tain themselves. Or if any Shaman Khel kills or severely wounds another Mahsud as a service of Government then the amount given to the Shaman Khel may be sufficient to enable him to make the customary amends to the heirs of the dead man. Moreover, it should be laid down and explained to the heirs of the deceased and the section to which he belonged that they should abandon their revenge over(502 N -W. F. PROVINCE—SOUTH WAZIRISTAN AGENCY—Mahsuds —NOS. VIII AND IX—1922. the killing of the dead man, otherwise any one taking revenge for that killing will be liable to punishment. 7. Within the limits of British territory our bahirs (caravans) should be treated as being on the same footing as the bahirs of British Indian subjects. 8. With regard to offences of damage to the telegraph and telephone lines we are responsible for offenders in our own tribe and in our own limits and we shall be responsible within our limits for offences by others on the understanding that our complicity is proved. 9. We are responsible for the enlistment of Khassadars to the extent of our share in the tribe and are willing that they should be located in our limits. 10. In return for all these responsibilities we pray that our allowances may be distributed to us. 11. The Khassadars will patrol, within the limits of their respective 'beats' and, working in conjunction with the maliks and elders, will bring in offenders and accused persons on safe conduct for settlement or investigation. The Khas sadars will release all kidnapped British subjects and will oppose raiders and will perform the duties of dial weshtas (tribal police) and badragga (tribal escort) with the officers of Government. 12. We pray for a copy of this document. jlrgah of the shaman khels. The loth July 1922. Note .—Similar petitions (with the exception of para. 1) were put forward by the Altzai and Bahlolzai Mahsuds. No. IX. Answer to the jVFahsud petition by the Resident in Waziristan,—1922. (1) 1 he Mahsuds are a Pathan tribe and like all other Pathan tribes must abide by Pathan customs or Pashto. (2) The main principle of Pashto is that of the joint responsibility of the com munity for the acts of each member of the community. Thus, a Pathan family is responsible for the acts of each member of that family ; a village is responsible for the acts of its inhabitants ; a sub-section is responsible for the acts of each mem ber of the sub-section ; a section is responsible for all its sub-sections and tribe of each of its sections. (3) On the other hand, if a Pathan leaves his family completely, the family may claim to be released from responsibility for his acts ; if a Pathan and his family leave their village or sub-section completely, then the village or sub -section may repudiate responsibility for their acts ; if a sub-section abandons its village or villages and removes itself entirely fromthe control of its section, then the sectionN.-W. F. PK0V1NCE—SOUTH WAZIRISTAN AGENCY—Mahsuds 093 —NO. IX—1922. may repudiate responsibility for the acts of the sub-section ; and if the sub section migrates bodily, then the tribe may repudiate responsibility for it. (4) If a Pathan or his group migrate as described in clause (3) and take refuge with another village, sub-section, section or tribe, then that other village, sub section, section or tribe becomes responsible for their acts. (5) But unless and until such actual separation of a Pathan from his family, or of the family from the village or sub-section, or of the sub-section and section from the section and tribe, respectively, takes place and a definite breach between the two also takes place up to that time the original responsibility of the larger tribal unit continues. A temporary separation and breach are not in themselves sufficient to absolve the larger unit ; the separation and breach must be such as to carry conviction to all parties. (6) According to strict Pathan customs, a Pathan who leaves his home for foreign service, e.g. service under the British Government in India, or under the Amir-in-Afghanistan, commercial or industrial service in India, Burma, Siam or any other lands or seas, and even a Pathan who is captured and awarded a long term of imprisonment in India, may still be considered as an active member of the tribe, that is to say, the bond of joint responsibility continues to connect him with his family and his tribe. Any blood feuds incurred by his family may be visited on him and his family and tribe may be involved in any feud he may have incurred while absent from the tribe. The mere fact of his being employed outside tribal limits, or by some person or Government other than the tribe, does not of itself break the bond of joint responsibility. (7) The British Government, however, has always accepted the principle that it does not hold the tribe, as such, responsible for the offences committed by any members of the tribe who have become separated from the tribe and have left their tribal country, unless it is known that those offences have been committed after communication with and with the complicity of the tribe or unless the tribe shelters the offenders after the commission of the offences. This limitation on the strict Pathan custom is based by Government on principles of justice. (8) The British Government also acts in most cases on the principle that, as far as possible, the punishment for an offence shall be inflicted on the actual offender, or if the actual offender cannot be secured, on his near relations, and in default, on his village, sub-section and section in progressive order. But in the end the joint responsibility of the whole tribe remains, and the tribe can never be completely divested thereof. The rights of Government in this matter remain unimpaired. (9) The second principle of Pathan custom or Pashto is that of territorial re sponsibility. Any person, family, village, sub-section or section owning and enjoying a tract of land is bound to prevent the violation of that tract by other persons, or sections for the purpose of committing offences on it or from it, and is liable to penalty unless it can be shown that the owners of the land opposed that violationI ! rp I (504 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—SOUTH WAZIRISTAN AGENCY-Mahsuds —NO. IX—1922. by armed force to the best of their ability. The same principle applies to the violation of the tracts by offenders after the commission of an offence This re sponsibility is inseparable from the ownership of the land; it is balanced by the right of badragga, or escort within the limits of that land. (10) The British Government recognise the badragga as an institution in tribal' territory, and it is opposed to it in such areas and under such conditions as mav render direct protection by Government impossible or undesirable. Whenever Government considers that badragga protection is required in any tract such badragga shall be arranged for through the maliks of the tract or section concerned and maliks and section in question will be held responsible for any loss to life or property. If such badraggas are arranged for otherwise than through the maliks the maliks and section will not be called to account by Government for any loss incurred. The responsibility for producing the badraggas demanded by Govern ment shall lie on the maliks, and the badraggas will be paid at the rates fixed by Government. (11) Nothing in clause 10 shall affect the right of the Khassadars to provide safe conduct in tribal territory, irrespective of the section or sub-section to which the individual Khassadar may belong and the tract in which he may be providing the escort. All Khassadars on escort duty shall be considered as constituting badragga on behalf of all three sections of the Mahsuds. If the badragga of the Khassadars is violated, then it shall be considered that the badragga of all three Mahsud sections has been violated. (12) The British Government has announced its intention of entertaining a number of Mahsud Khassadars in Mahsud country for the purpose of enabling the tribe to maintain order within its own limits and of executing the orders of the local Government officials. The number of these Khassadars and the localities in which they will be stationed will be fixed with due regard to local conditions. Their main duties will consist of :—- the execution of the orders of the local officials passed after consultation with the maliks and elders, the summoning of persons whose attendance is required (on safe conduct) by the local officials, the investigation of reports relating to the area in which they are posted, the tracing and recovery of any person kidnapped from British territory, the opposition of raiding gangs violating their area, the escorting of Government officials, and in general the duties of chal weshta (tribal police) and badragga (tribal escort). (13) The question of awarding compensation to the heirs of any Khasaadar killed while in the execution ol his duty has been referred to the CJovernment of%CI 4 , Hi: 0f S«iE| titoiiii. niitff. :tioD 01 [ MIKKJP; 1 wlicl icijb 1 C0Qsi( iW(lli|r ids, 11 tie W®, N.-W.

(14) The total amount of allowances now sanctioned for the Mahsnds is one lakh and eight thousand British rupees per annum. The distribution of this sum will be effected in the manner finally approved by Government, but it must be clearly understood that no share in the allowances can be considered to be hered itary. The allotted shares will be continued from one year to another as far as possible without alteration, subject to the conditions that the grantee continues to be the best representative of his group or sub-section and that he continues to render valuable service to Government. Failing either of these conditions, the grant is liable to be suspended or confiscated and transferred to some other mem ber of the group, sub-section or section who may appear preferable to the original grantee. In any case, on the death of a grantee his allowance does not automatically descend to his heir or any other relation, unless that relation is also approved as representing his group and serviceable to Government. (15) The grant of these allowances is conditional on the general good behaviour of the three sections of the Mahsud tribe on the assumption of full responsibility, both tribal and territorial, for all offences against Government and the subjects of Government, and for whole-hearted co-operation in maintaining the Khas- sadars in the interests of peace and effective control. It must be understood that the grant of allowances and the institution of the Khassadar force are inseparable portions of one scheme, and that, if the Khassadar force fails to effect its object, the allowances must also be withdrawn. (16) As the system of Khassadars is developed it will be necessary to consider the advisability of absolving the Khassadars, in their capacity as chal weshtas, from liability to blood feuds ; this will be done in consultation with the Mahsud jirga. The advisability of declaring the Takki Zam road, and any other roads leading to Khassadars posts, to be ' Protected Roads ' for all travellers, caravans and Khassadars, will also be considered. The Takki Zam road from Tank to Razmak will enable Mahsud caravans also to visit Bannu via Tochi and will have to be declared a shahi sarak or protected high road. (17) Petitions have been received asking that Mahsuds should receive in British territory the privileges accorded to British Indian subjects. This can only be considered when the Mahsuds pay land revenue and other taxes like British Indian subjects or like the inhabitants of the Kurram and Tochi Agencies. But every improvement in the conduct of the Mahsud tribe towards the British Government will be met bv an equal demonstration of good will on the part of the British. ■006 N - w - *• PKOVINCE—SOUTH WAZJillSTAN AGENCY Mahsvds —NOS.

No. XI. franslation of a Petition submitted by the Abdullais to the General Officer Commanding, Waziristan Force at Makin , through the Eesident in Waziristan on the 2l8t February 1923. We are the representatives of the Abdullais section of the Mahsuds. Some forty days ago we received an order from the Government to surrender five persons for trial on the charge of having murdered a British officer in the Khaisora Valley, the country of the Mohmit Khel AVazirs, about one month previously. These five persons were :— (1) Musa Khan, Bahadur Khel, Lalli Khel, Abdullai. (2) Bahawal Khan, Payo Khel, Lalli Khel, Abdullai. (3) Shahir Khan, Gula Khel, Lalli Khel, Abdullai. (4) Azorgai, Bahadur Khel, Lalli Khel, Abdullai. (5) Toter, Bahadur Khel, Lalli Khel, Abdullai,N.-W. F. PROVINCE—SOUTH WAZUUSTAN AGENCY— Mahsuds fi 07 -NO. X[—1923. Of these five persons, Musa Khan was demanded because he had openly claimed responsibility for instigating the murder, and the remaining four persons were demanded because they were the actual murderers. One more person, named Shawan Shabi Khel, hamsaya of Makin, has recently become known to Govern ment as also having been one of the actual murderers, and the Government is also demanding his surrender. When the surrender of these five persons was demanded from us by Govern ment, we pointed out that we were unable to hand them over as they were too strong for us, having the support of certain persons outside the tribe. Accordingly Government in announcing its intention to punish these offenders, also announced its intention of sparing the innocent as much as possible and came to Makin in search of the offenders who fled to the hills of the Darra, Mandech and Spin Kamar tracts. We do not dispute the justice of the demands of Government, nor are we pre pared to prove the innocence of these six persons-of Musa Khan for instigating the murder and of his five companions who carried it out. But we wish to repre sent that Musa Khan's party, though at present weakened and exiled, may still recover its former strength and influence if Government's forces are withdrawn from the Makin neighbourhood, since he receives support in money and ammunition from outside the tribe. Thus we are not able to guarantee that Musa Khan and his party will not return to Makin for the purpose of intriguing against Government from the moment that Government withdraws its support from us. For this reason we are anxious that Government should engage our Khassadars from the Band Khel and Umar Khel sections of Makin, as well as from the Abdullai, to support us in our efforts to maintain order and to put a stop to the mischief of Musa Khan s party. Ihese Khassadars should be enlisted as soon as possible and should be posted at a spot selected by Government. We are anxious that a road should be built to that Khassadar post through our limits from Razmak side and from the Piazha side and we request that that road may be built now and that we may be given some share of the contracts thereof. Further we request that now that good relations are being restored between the Government and ourselves we may be granted Maliki allowances like all the other Mahsud sections, and in return we accept full responsibility, sectional and terri torial, as they have done. In future we will commit no offences against Govern ment territory or the protected areas of Government, and we hold ourselves res ponsible for all future misdeeds of any outlaws from British territory who may be residing with us. We request that we may receive an amnesty for any offences committed by our section during the past years of hostility, and in return we undeitake to hand back to Government all Government rifles which are known to be with us at this time.

Rrply of the GtENEral Officer Commanding, Waziristan Force , to the petitiok of the Abdullais section at a jirga at Makin on the 22nd February 1923. I have heard the petition which you have signed and represented to the Kesi- dent yesterday. It has again been explained to you in Pashtu and you have endorsed it. I wish to remind you that you are liable by your own tribal custom to suffer for the misdeeds of your fellow tribesmen to surrender them for trial and punish ment. There can be no question that the whole of Makin is liable to be punished for the crimes of Musa Khan and his associates who murdered Lieutenant Dicksou, I have, however, taken all possible steps hitherto to confine the punishment to the guilty and to save the innocent from suffering. I realise, moreover, that in the case of Musa Khan and his party there are certain facts which make it difficult for you to exercise control over him according to your tribal custom. It is well known as you say that he has received much support from outside the tribe. This may make it difficult for you at first to exclude him and his associates from your limits, but I warn you that it is your duty to keep him away from Makin. Government is prepared to assist you in carrying out this duty by engaging your Khassadars. It is also the intention of Government, as you know, to locate its forces on the Eazmak Plateau, whence they will be in a position to inflict serious damage on any village which is known to be sheltering these offenders. The roads connecting the Makin Khassadar post with Razmak and Piazha are also necessary and their construction will be taken in hand as soon as Government thinks fit. In view of the difficulties caused by Mahsud contractors in the past, I cannot promise that the road will be built solely by Mahsud contractors and I propose to construct a considerable part of it by means of the troops under my command. But if I find I can get the work satisfactorily and cheaply done by Mahsud contractors, I am quite ready to consider your request on the subject. Your Khassadars will be enlisted in a few days and a post will be built on a spot which I will select. As regards allowance, you will receive them as from the date of this settlement on the same scale as the other Mahsuds and on the same conditions of full sectional and territorial responsibility. You will in future be hold strictly responsible for the acts of all outlaws from British territory residing with you. You will receive an amnesty for all past offences on condition that you return all Government rifles known to be in your possession. Tauda China Camp; T. G.

Announcement by the General Officer Commanding, Waziristan Force, to the Mahsud jirga at Tauda China Camp, Makin , on 23rd March 1923. 1. On the 5th November 1921, at Tank I announced through the Resident in Waziristan the orders of Government regarding their future policy in MahsudN.-W. F. PROVINCE SOUTH WAZIBISTAN AGENCY— —NO. XIII—1923. \ il Hi country to you, the representatives of the three Mahsud sections. You remember the terms which were then announced. In pursuance of that policy you were granted increased Mali la allowances and a scheme was drawn up for affording you generous employment in a Khassadar force for the purpose of enabling you to carry out your responsibilities for controlling your countrv. 2. In July last a further jirga of your representatives was held in Ladha in t details of t}ie dls tribution of allowances and of the Khassadar scheme was worked out. You also accepted your full sectional and territorial respond bilities and these are now re-affirmed. 3 Siace July last, unfortunately, some of your sections behaved in a manner which necessitated the use of force against them, both by land and from air I am glad, however, that the Abdullais and Band Khels of Makin have now made a settlement with Government, and I hope they will do their best to carry it out. The Jallal Khels have also made a settlement and I hope to see their representa tive jirga at Sararogha in a day or two. The Garrarai and Guri Khel sub-sections of the Manzais, whose representatives are here today, have made amends for their recent offences. A few sections, however, of the Bahlolzais and Manzais are not represented here now but I hope to go shortly to Sarwekai where it may be possible to effect a settlement with them also. 4. During the last ten days you have been here and have discussed in detail with the Resident the arrangements required for carrying into effect the policy of Government as now defined. That policy, as you have been informed, is in- tended to enable you to organise your tribe in such a manner that you may be able to carry out the responsibilities which you owe to Government especially to control the bad characters of your tribe. Your duties to Government include your assistance in the construction and protection of the roads which are now being undertaken from the plateau of Razmak to Sararogha and from Jandola to Sarwekai. Owing to the unsatisfactory nature of the work done by certain Mahsud contractors in the past Government has decided to exercise their right to construct as much of the road as they think fit by military labour and by outside contractors. But as you have presented many applications to be granted contracts on the road work, I am authorising the Resi dent to arrange for the employment of such Mahsud contractors as may be con sidered likely to execute their contracts satisfactorily and cheaply. The Resident will also arrange with you for the allotment of contracts in certain areas to each of the main sections and for the protection of the work by the sections concerned. • F ). Later on, when the work of constructing permanent posts for the Scouts located at Sararogha, Kotkai, the Shahur Tangi and Sarwekai can be taken in hand, it will be seen whether your work as contractors on the road will justify your being given the contracts for the construction of the posts also. 6. When the roads and posts have been constructed you will be allowed to assist in protecting them and for this purpose the scheme of Khassadar posts has been re-considered with you by the Resident, and you have agreed to the scheme as now recorded by him. 2 s g610 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—SOUTH WAZIRTSTAN AGENCY— Mahsuds —NOS. XI[I—1923 AND XIV—1924. This scheme is intended, as you are well aware, to ensure that each section and sub-section of the Mahsud tribe shall receive a paid share of the benefits offered by Government. It is the intention of Government that you should be given every opportunity of carrying out your duties by means of your own tribal organisa tion, with as little interference by Government as possible. But Government reserves the right at all times to take all necessary steps for the enforcement of order in tribal territory and it reserves its right to seize offenders wherever they may be found and to punish them in any way that it thinks fit. 7. Finally, I wish to announce to you that I intend shortly to withdraw this force in order that I may concentrate my military labour on the Sararogha-Dwa Toi portion of the road. I hope your contractors who will be offered contracts on the Dwa Toi-Tauda China portion, will carry out their work so efficiently that it may not be necessary for me to bring a force to this camp in order to have the road completed by military labour.

We, the Maliks of the three Mahsuds clans, were summoned to attend on 23rd September 1924 in case of some fires made over Government officials between Sararogha and Razmak and we were asked to submit a written agreement for taking resp onsibility. We unanimously beg to say that we have already submitted a similar agres' ment at Ladha in July 1922, which we hope will be in the office of Political Agent- The same agreement is quite correct and we are still bound to that. 2. We also agree that if any badmash will fire on a Government official on road or on a fort from a distance of one mile, the Khassadars and the villagers of the neighbourhood will not be held responsible for that mischief. The Political Officer will trace out culprits and if they wore found guilty the officer will send for their maliks who would bring forth the badmashes for the settlement. If they failed in bringing them the chief maliks of their sections will then produce them for trial. If no trace of the badmashes could be found the fine imposed will be paid up by the three Mahsuds. 3. If Kabul hostiles will commit such mischief as mentioned above in paragraph 2. we will not be held responsible for their misdeed as they are hostiles to the Govern ment as well as enemies to us, and if any body will feed them he will be liable to punishment. 4.

The wishes of the tribe concerned will however be ascertained and due consideration given to them at the time of undertaking construction. The compensation where due will be paid to the person or persons to whom it is found to be due, i .e., the owner or owners by the Political Agent, and not to the tribe or to the Dre Mahsuds. V. The Government is further at liberty to make use of all water, springs, streams and tanks, etc., subject to the following conditions :—• 1. Where the use of such water by Government affects the power of a water- mill either by stopping it altogether or diminishes its profits, com pensation to be assessed by the Political Agent will be paid on it. 2.

This, however, does not apply to the Urmurs to whom contracts and commission will be given separately for those portions of the road which may pass through their territory. ^ IT.

The most important of the trans-border tribes under the political control of the Deputy Commissioner, Dera Ismail Khan, are two of the three Bhitanni clans: certain Ghilzai nomads and semi-permanent settlers: and the Largha Shiranis. 1. BHITANNIS. The two Bhitanni clans under the political control of the Deputy Commissioner, Dera Ismail Khan, are the Tatta and Waraspun. The third clan, the Dhanna, is under that of the Deputy Commissioner, Bannu (see Part VII). The fighting strength of the tribe is estimated at 6,000. In 1860, at the time of the expedition against the Mahsuds, the Bhitannis gave some little assistance to the British force. In 1876, at the time of the reorganization of the Tank border (sec Part IX, Mahsuds) all three Bhitanni clans entered into an Agreement (No.'I) accepting pass responsibility on the Tank as well as the Bannu frontier. In January 1879 the Bhitannis made no attempt to prevent or resist the Mahsud raid on Tank (see Part IX) and were punished, and fined Rs. 10,000. In March a renewed Agreement (No. II) was taken from all three clans. In April 1880 the Bhitannis of Tandola gave some trouble. A small force was sent against them, find in May they submitted. In February 1883 their frontier service, which had been suspended in 1879, was restored. The reorganization of their service, and the redistribution of their allowances, were carried out under conditions •'No. Ill) laid down in 1890. The Bhitannis claim to have given assistance in the Mahsud delimita tion of 1894: and they undoubtedly gave considerable help to the troops during the blockade operations against the Mahsuds in 1901-02. Koi this they were given a reward of about Ps. 2,000, and were piesented with sanads. They did, however, commit one outrage during this period, by robbing the mail tonga in the Pezu Pass in 1901, for which they were fined Ps. .1,800. In 1908, in order to ensure the safety and tranquillity of the Jandola- Tank route, a strip of Bhitanni territory was marked out as a protected area, through which the Mahsud trading caravans could pass unmolested to British territory. In 1907 all the three Bhitanni clans signed an Agreement (No. IV^ renewing and extending that of 1890.1 J 620 N.-W. F. PROVINCE—DERA ISMAIL KHAN DISTRTCT— Bhitannis, Ghilzai and Shiranis. In 1914, owing to general misconduct of the tribe, and failure to take pass responsibility, the Bhitanni allowances were suspended. Thev were restored in 1917. In 1918 the levy and silladari allowances, paid to the tribe in lieu of liability to provide armed men to assist Government, amounted to Es. 12,712 per annum. In that year they were increased to Es. 25 764 but, owing to the subsequent misbehaviour of the tribe, the allowances on this enhanced scale were not actually granted till 1921. The silla dari allowances are now known as maliki or lungi allowances In 1919 a revised agreement, similar to that taken from the Dhanna {see Part VII, No. V), was taken from the Tatta and Waraspun clans. Between 1922 and 1924 the old Bhitanni Levies were expanded into a Corps of Khassadars, whose functions are to protect the Bhitanni border of the Dera Ismail Khan District, the road through the Hinnis l angi between Khirgi and Jandola and the Shahur road from Jandola to Shwak Narai, a place three and a half miles from Jandola. 2. GHILZAI. Besides the permanent settlements of Dotannis and Suleman Khel Ghilzai in the South Waziristan Agency {q.v., Part IX), both these clans have semi-permanent settlements, during their passage between Afghanistan and India, in the Dera Ismail Khan district. Of the numerous other Ghilzai clans that do the same, the Nasir settle in the Dera Ismail Khan and Dera Ghazi Khan dictricts in the winter, and in Baluchistan in the summer: and the Mian Khel, or Miam, inhabit a portion of the Gonial Valley. In 187b, when the Bhitannis accepted pass responsibility on the Tank frontier, similar arrangements were made with the Miani and the Ghwarazai (a clan of the Kakar tribe of Baluchistan, living apart from the bulk of the tribe) on the skirt of the Gonial Valley. The Mahsud laid on Tank, in January 1879, was the signal for general disorder, in which the Miani and Ghwarazai joined; but they were soon reduced to submission. 3. SHIRANIS. The Shiranis are divided into the Largha, or eastern, and the Bargha, oi western, Shiranis. The Largha Shiranis are under the political control of the Deputy Commissioner, Dera Ismail Khan : the Bargha Shiranis are included in the Zhob Political Agency, Baluchistan. The fighting strength of the Largha Shiranis is about 2,500. They are divided into three clans—Hassan Khel, Oba Khel and Chuhar Khel. in ISod misconduct on the part of the tribe was punished by a military expedition, In 1874 the tribe formally acknowledged their responsi- we in, iN.-W. F. PROVINCE T)F^RA ISMAIL KHAN DISTRICT—^21 bility for crimes cominitted in British territory; but in 1882 they were guilty of several serious offences, and were blockaded. They soon submitted : and in July 1883 the whole tribe executed an Entrae'ement (No. Y). At the end of 1883 a military survey expeditiou visited the Takht-i- Suliman, and a temporary arrangement was made with the Chuhar Khel clan for good behaviour during the expedition. The Khidar/ai division of the Oba Xhel clan had, however, maintained a defiant attitude for many years, and seized the opportunity of the survey operations to attack the escort. In February 1890, in connection with the opening of the Gonial Pass to traffic, the Largha Shiranis presented a petition (No. VI) asking for Government service for guarding the pass. This was accepted, and allowances amounting to lis. 567 per mensem were granted. They also undertook to bring about the submission of the Khidarzai: who, during the progress of the negotiations, had not only ignored an invitation to come in, but had fired on a cavalry patrol: and to hold themselves res ponsible for their future good conduct. Misconduct on the part of the Khidarzai, however, continued : and in October and November 1890, their country was entered by a military force, whereupon they submitted. A darbar, at which representatives of the whole of the Shiiani tribe were present, was held, all pending cases were settled, and the tribe as a whole was fined Rs. 6,000, which was shortly afterwards realised in full. In March 1891 an Agreement (No. YIT) was taken from the Largha Shiranis, under the terms of which they were granted monthly allowances of lis. 917, and hostages were taken. Certain Khidarzai headmen were imprisoned; but they were released in September 1891 on paying the fines imposed on them, and giving security for future good behaviour. In 1899 the Largha Shiranis presented a petition (No. VIII) asking for increased allowances and offering to pay lis. 2,000 a year by way of revenue, in return for Government assistance in the management of their watercourses. The offer was accepted: and the allowances were increased by lis. 3,600 a year. In September 1901 the Largha Shiranis were held responsible for the murder of a Zhob Agency muharrir, which took place in the Ohuhar Khel-Dhanna Pass: and in February 1902 the Extra Assistant Com missioner at the Domanda post was murdered by an Oba Khel jema dar of the border military police, and the post destroyed. For the former offence, the Largha Shiranis were fined lis. 500 : and the latter was avenged by a small punitive expedition. The unrest among the Shiranis was of short duration, order was quickly restored, and I he troops were withdrawn.^22 N --W. F. PHOVIJMGE—DEKA ISMAIL KHAN D1BT1UCT—jS/u&gt;om«. In tlie disturbances consequent on the outbreak of the Afghan War of 1919, the posts in the Shirani country were evacuated and their garrisons withdrawn. Most of the posts were destroyed by the Shiranis both the Largha and Bargha divisions of the tribe being implicated The Shirani allowances were, in consequence, first suspended and later confiscated. In November 1919 the Largha Shiranis accepted the terms (No. IX) imposed upon them, and their allowances were restored with effect from the 1st April 1921.N.-W. P.

Translation of a Petition and Engagement presented by the Shirani Jirga, dated 13th July 1883. The object of these lines is as follows :— Owing to the evil deeds of some of the Shirani bad characters who have committed oifences in British territory, the executive officers of Government have shut out the tribe from British territory. We therefore now as representatives of all the Shiranis make the following promises in order to have the blockade raised (1) Rupees 2,530-3 are still due by us on account of compensation for offences committed by the tribe. All the stolen property that can be collected will be now handed over to the executive officers of the Government. The Chaudwan dam and the water-mill which were burnt and destroyed by our tribe we will reconstruct with our own hands. The balance remaining after deducting value of cattle to be returned, and the labour we supply in repairing dam and re-building water-mill will be guaran teed in cash by a trustworthy surety resident of British territory, who will pay the amount due within a period of two months. The said surety will make up the sumN.-W. F. PROVINCE—DERA ISMAIL KHAN DISTRICT— Shiranis ($9 —NOS.

If, however, we wish the blockade to be raised before tender of security, we will place a number of our hostages (to be fixed by Government) in British territory, and the cost of their maintenance will be borne by ourselves so long as they remain in British territory. (2) As regards future offences, we engage to restore the actual stolen property or to point out the offenders or their property when they come down to the plains and make them over to the Sarkar within three months from date of committal of offences. If we fail to do this, the whole tribe will be liable to pay in compensation. These terms include the Khidarzais and Chuhar Khels. In the same manner, we shall be responsible for individuals of other tribes who may be in the Shirani limits. (3) We engage to expel outlaws who, having committed offences in Bri; jsh terri tory, seek refuge in our country. Mir Khan, Gondapur murderer, who is now with us, we will turn out from our country. We will send down Mir Ahmad, Mian Khel, and Muhammad Biluch to the plains if they agree to have their cases tried by jirga, otherwise we will expel them from our country.

We beg respectfully to represent that we the Shirani Maliks went to Appozai in compliance with the Government invitation. The Government accepted the sub mission of the Bargha division of our tribe, and granted them service, and entered into agreement with them, they becoming responsible on that side. Some of the men of the Largha division did not come in, and consequently no settlement was arrived at with us. We therefore accompanied your camp to Dera. The Kidderzai Maliks have not come in and made submission. In this they are to blamc^and we therefore consider them our enemies. We the Maliks of the Uba Khel and Hassan Khel sections pray that a settlement be made with us on the following terms . ■ That the Government may grant us service allowance, which we will distribute between us, and we will carry out any orders the Govern ment may be pleased to give in regard to those members of our tribe who have not yet come in to tender their submission.630 N-W.

That within six months we will engage to bring them in and submit unconditionally, and in the meantime we will hold ourselves respon sible for their good behaviour. If we fail to bring them in within that period, the service granted us may be forfeited. And in case the (Jovernment should decide to send a force against them, we will ren der every assistance in our power and help the Government army and servants through any route within our limits.

Translation of a Petition presented by the Shirani Maliks , etc., to the Commis sioner and Superintendent, Derajat Division, dated 4th March 1899. We, the Shiranni Tumandars, Maliks and Mutabirs, beg to state that since the construction of levy posts in our country 8 or 9 years ago our tribesmen have com mitted no serious offences in British territory. Cases, however, arise among ourselve s and specially between us and the Barghawals ; Government demands offenders from us, and when we are unable to surrender them the authorities are displeased with us. Murders are committed in our tribe, and we are unable to inflict deterrent punishment on offenders. Ever since the Sarkar has entered our country culti vation has increased, but as long as no satisfactory arrangement is made for water-courses (vials) the whole of the culturable land cannot be brought under culti vation. In the construction of ' vials ' disputes regarding the distribution of water ensue and until we come to an agreement nothing can be effected. If Gov ernment, however, will assist and help us in the management of our ' vials ' great improvement can be made in cultivation. We shall willingly pay revenue to Government. Government, however, should show so much favour as not to impose a heavy revenue. We shall gladly pay Government To th of the produce in accord ance with the Muhammadan law (Shariat). To determine the share of Government it will be necessary to measure lands or weigh produce. To avoid this for the present we desire that Government should accept Rs. 2,000 a year for two or three years as a fixed sum and afterwards assess the revenue by measurement of lands when it thinks proper. Government should look upon us as its subjects and con sider our country the same as the Daman and decide our cases through its officers. Regard should*however, be paid to our allowances. We have previously stated that our allowances are small, and now too beg to request that our allowances may be increased. The present amount is insufficient for us, for a large portion is paid as service allowance ; and the amount of Maliki allowance is only nominal. The Syads and religious leaders (Pirs) should be exempted from payment of t) e No. VIII.N.-W. F. PROVIKCE—DERA ISMAIL. KHAN DISTRICT—S/urams (333 —NOS. VIII—1899 AND IX—1919. revenue. As we are British subjects, we shall esteem it a great favour if Gov ernment will assist us in the preparation of our water channels and construct roads in our country with a view to facilitate communications. Government should confer honors on our leading men in the same way as they do in British territory. {Here follow the signatures.) No. IX. Terms for the Largha Shiranis,—1919. 1. All outstanding allowances to be confiscated and allowances will not again be granted until the British Government is satisfied of the good behaviour of the Largha Shiranis. 2. All Government property taken by the Largha Shiranis since 1st May 1919 to be returned. A sum of Rs. 600 will be accepted in lieu of any rifle which is proved to have passed from the control of the tribe. 3. A fine of Rs. 10,000 to be paid. 4. Government will station troops, construct roads, posts, aeroplane landing grounds and water channels or other arrangements for the supply of water to posts wherever it may deem necessary. Tribal labour for the same and tribal badraggas where required will be furnished at the normal rates of pay locally in force, but Government reserves to itself the right to employ any outside labour it may think fit. 5. Any land or the water of any springs or streams required for the purposes referred to in paragraph 4 above to be made over to Government without payment of compensation. Wood may be cut and stone quarried for the same purposes without payment whenever required in the Largha Shirani Country. 6.

Agreement mabe between the Nakib of Mokalla anb the K aitis ,—1873 Praise he to God ! On Wednesday, the 3rd of Rajab 1290, the Honourable Abdulla and Salih and Awadth, sons of Omar-bin-Awadh-al Kaiti, purchased and became the owners oJ half of the Bandar Mokajla, with all its fortifications, and half of the Bandar Buram from Nakib Omar and Nakib Muhammad, sons of the late Nakib Salah for the sum of $2,40,000. Out of this was deducted $1,60,000, which was due by their father (the late Nakib) to the Kaiti, the remaining 180,000 was paid to them. The total value amounts to $2,40,000, half of which is $1,20,000. The above-mentioned Nakib Omar and Nakib Muhammad, sons of the late Nakib balah, have already sold half of the Bandar of Mokalla and half of Buram as has been said above with all their rights, internal and external. This sale is quite fixed upon those whose names have been mentioned above, viz., Abdalla and Salih and Awadth-bin-Omar. This sale lias paid off all the debts that were upon the late Nakib Salah-bin-Muhammad. There is nothing now remaining of this debt. 11 any claim is advanced, it will be null and void. They have settled that Nakib Omar is to be Governor of Mokalla and to do justice according to the Mu- hammadan law, and to order for good and prevent evil, and not to oppress the subjects and others. If any quarrel should arise among the seafaring men, they are to be sent to those of their own class. In all cases relating to law, justice to be done according to the Muhammadan law. All mercantile cases to be sent to the merchants for trial. Khairulla, the slave of the late Nakib Salah, is to do all work relating to the Bazar. Nakib Omar is to govern according to justice in all small cases, and in cases of importance he should consult with any one of the sons of Omar-bin-Awadth. If all of them are absent, then to consult with their Agents, ^.akib Omar cannot settle anything without their consultation, nor can he write any correspondence with the High Ottoman Governments or its officers, neither to the English Government or its officers, also not with any other power, without consulting the Kaiti people or their Agents. He also can not have interviews with any of the above-mentioned Governments without their or their Agent s presence. Their opinion and their voice should be one. Nakib Omar cannot do anything without their consultation. If he were to do violence to any person, the Kaiti or their Agents should give him advice. If he does not hear their advice, they can prevent his acting without right. The Kaiti can put their garrison in half of the Mokalla forts, and can also put their soldiers in the house called Najdi, situated near the northern fort and the eastern fort, and also in forts situated out of Mokalla, viz., Bakarain and Thamaj, and Nakib Omar can keep his garrison in forts Nakan and Dis, and all the other remaining fortsADEN— Shihr and Mule alia —APPENDIX NO. II. vii are to be divided equally. The Kaiti can put their garrison in Bandar Buram on account of their half-right. Nakib Omar should give them house. The Kaiti can build houses for themselves and put clerks in the Custom House and the gate to keep accounts ot exports and imports. All the revenue arising from the tax or other things is to be divided equally. The Kaiti can reside in the house of Nakib Abdulla for one year until he may build one for himself. These agree ments for the sale have been made with each other's consent without force and compulsion. Ihe Nakib Omar and Nakib Muhammad have got possession of the amount of the value, and have given permission to those men whose names have been mentioned below to be witnesses of this :— Names of Witnesses.

On Wednesday, the 3rd of Rajab 1290, the Honourable Abdulla Salih and Awadth, sons of Omar bin Awadth-al-Kaiti, and Nakib Omar and Nakib Mu hammad, sons of the late Nakib Salah, have joined together to assist one another and to obey the Muhammadan law. They swear before God that each will behave honestly towards the other and will order for good and prevent evil. They should have one and the same friends and one and the same enemies. Mokalla is between the Kasadi and Kaiti, Shihr and Mokalla are one, and Hadthramut and the sea-coast are one. He who is an enemy to the Kaiti is an enemy of the Kasadi, and he who is an enemy of the Kasadis is an enemy of the Kaithi; the one is not to give refuge to the enemy of the other ; but if the Kaiti see that it is good to settle with an enemy he can do so. If the Kaiti have a claim against any one, he is to get it if the things claimed are not burnt or destroyed. Kaiti are to be as fathers and Kasadis to be as sons and attendants. The Kasadis are to obey the directions of the Kaiti. Both parties are one, and each should do good to the other and prevent evil. Nakib Omar is not to keep friendship with the Kathiris and the Aulakis but through the Kaiti. The agreement that hadviii ADEN— tihihr and Mukalla —APPENDIX NO. II. been made between the late Nakib Salah and Awadth-bin-Omar the Kaiti is ap proved by Nakib Omar, except about the money mentioned in the agreement which has been paid oft' by the sale of the half of Mokalla, which also is mentioned in the agreement.

If none of these -R. SiKDEMiH, De^i, Commw- proposal3 ^adopted, then the next best thing to do is to release Jam Mir Khan, now in confine ment in British territory, but this should be conditional on his ceasing to wage war on me and causing injury to my country. He should be required to render the same allegiance to my Government as he did to the Governments of former Khans of Khelat, and I on my part will engage not to encroach on his rights and privileges. 3. The Brahooee Sirdars should be required to expel from the country my ex-Wuzeer Atta Mahomed, who treacherously escaped from Khelat notwithstanding my servant Nawab Mahomed Khan was security for him. Lhe ex-Wuzeer is doing all he can to keep up disturbances throughout the length and breadth of the land. After a permanent peace has been arranged on the condition that the ex-VVuzeer leaves the Khelat State, I will allow his family (who are in Khelat) to go with him. 4. By the settlement come to in 1872 by Sir William Merewether it was decreed that the Sarawan Brahooees should pay compensation for the kafila they plundered in the Bolan Pass. This compensation they could not pay. I had to give Rs. 35,000 to the merchants. I had also to pay lis. 55,000 to the merchants that were plundered by the Murrees. I had thus a total sum of Rs. 90,000 to pay merchants on account of kafilas plundered by the Brahooees. It was decreed that they should pay, but as they had not the means I had to do so. I received, after the settlement, a lakh of rupees from the Government for my own use, but by this means I only received Rs. 10,000. This was not what the British Government intended ; I therefore desire that the money should be refunded to me.xlvi ftALUCHIS'TAN—APPENDIX NO. 1. 5. The annual subsidy of Rs. 50,000 which I used to receive has now for three years ceased, but I do not feel 1 have committed any fault to have caused this. Formerly the Khelat Government used to levy transit fees-at one rupee per maund. The British Government reduced this to 8 annas per maund, and the Rs. 50,000 was given as compensation. 6. My Commandant Shukur Khan and my Munshis Mulla Saleh Muhammad and Gul Muhammad were taken from me and put in prison by the British Govern ment without their having committed any fault. I shall feel obliged by the British Government releasing them and allowing them to depart in peace. 7. I desire to appoint Nawab Muhammad Khan, who is a well-wisher of my Government, to attend on Major Sandeman as my agent, 8. I desire that the share of the transit fees to which the Brahooees are entitled by ancient usage shall be continued to them as decreed by Sir William Merewether. 9. Whatever terms of peace the British Government desire to give the Brahooees on the part of my Government that I will agree to. I will not violate terms. Let the past be forgotten. I will restore to the Sarawan and Jalawan Sirdars their ancestral lands ; and should they at any future time violate the conditions of peace, before punishing them I will report what has occurred to the British Gov ernment through the Political Agent at Khelat, and after receiving sanction (from British) I will then punish the offenders. On the other hand, should my Naibs and officers cause them injury contrary to custom and ancient usage, and should I not on being referred to do justice, then I am willing that my case should be appealed through the Political Officer at Khelat to the British Government for orders. 10. The Brahooees should, according to precedent and old rule, serve me and obey my orders, and I on my part will confer favours on them, as my ancestors did. 11. Should the British Government approve of these desires of mine as recorded herein, then my Government will hold itself responsible for the safety of the Bolan, Mulla, Raj, Kedj, Mekran, and all other Khorassan Passes, and I will do my best to keep these Passes open, as desired by the British Government.BALUCHISTAN —APPENDIX NO. II. xlvii BALUCHISTAN. APPENDIX No. II. The following rules for the guidance of the Sirdars and Naibs in conduoting the civil administration of the Khelat State received the assent of His H ighness the Khan of Khelat on the 1st August 1876. Whereas the late civil war created great difficulty in the administration of the Khelat State, which of late years, contrary to ancient usage, has been entirely iti the hands of the Naibs, supported by a small body of regular troops ; and whereas peace has been again restored to the country, 1, Mir Khodadad Khan, Khan of Khelat, direct that the former civil administration of the country be restored, and I publish the following rules, which this day have received my assent, for the guidance of my Sirdars and Naibs : The civil administration of the country is divided into four parts— 1. Collection of revenue, whether in cash or in kind. 2. Settlement of claims for money, etc. 3. Disposal of criminal cases. 4. The protection of the civil power by the military. Regarding the first I direct my Naibs not to interfere in any way with revenue free grants. These are to remain, as formerly, entirely in the hands of the Brahooees. But should a Brahooee purchase from a ryot land on which revenue, either in cash or in kind, has been fixed, the Nail) will collect from him the usual assessment. Should any Brahooee refuse to pay the assessment to the Naib, the latter will at once refer to the Sirdar of the tribe to which the Brahooee belongs, who will realise the amount due. Should the Sirdar consider the Brahooees had just grounds for refusing to pay the assessment, he will refer them to the Naib, and should the latter concur, the claim will be dismissed. Should the Naib not agree with the Sirdar the latter can refer the dispute to His Highness the Khan, whose decision in the matter will be final, and the Sirdar will be responsible for putting it in force. After putting the Khan's order in force, should the Sirdar consider the Khan's order unjust, he can refer the matter through the Political Agent at Khelat to the British Government. The procedure recorded here applies to all disputes regarding the collection of revenue, whether in cash or in kind. 2. Money transactions, debts, etc.— As a rule, when the plaintiff and defendant belong to one and the same tribe, the Sirdar of the tribe will in accordance with ancient custom hear and dispose of the case. In the event of the Sirdar's decision giving dissatisfaction to either plaintiff or defendant, party dissatisfied can appeal to His Highness the Khan, whose decision .shall be final. The Sirdar, on being informed of the Khan's decision, must put it in force. In the event of a Hindu or Dewar complaining against a Brahooee, the claim in the first instance must go before the Sirdar of the tribe. Should a settlement in which both sides concurxlviii BALUCHISTAN—APPENDIX NO. II. be come to, weJl and good ; if not, the claim will be brought by the complainant before the Naib, who will dispose of it according to State law. Appeal from tho Naib's order will lie to His Highness the Khan, whose decision is final and must be carried out by the Sirdar. In the event of the plaintiff being a Brahooee and the defendant a Dewar or Hindu, the claim in the first instance must be brought before the Naib, who will dispose of the case according to State law. From the Naib's order an appeal will lie to His Highness the Khan, whose decision shall be final. The order of the Naib need not be put in force by the Sirdar until the Khan 's decision is known, then it must be put in force at once*. 3. Regarding the disposal of all criminal cases.—Should plaintiff and defendant be Brahooees or Belooch and belong to the same tribe, the Sirdar will according to ancient custom dispose of the case. An appeal from his order will lie to His Highness the Khan, whose decision shall be final and must be put in force by the Sirdar. In the event of the Sirdar not having the power for any course whatever to enforce His Highness' order, in that case he will apply to His Highness for help to enforce the order of the Khelat Government. Should the Sirdar consider the act of His Highness an oppressive one, he can complain to the British Govern ment through the Political Agent. In the event of the complainant being a Dewar or Hindu and the defendant a Brahooee, the case must go before the Naib, and the Sirdar, on the Naib s application, must seize the defendant and make him over to the Naib. The Sirdar can attend at the inquiry, and take part in it, and if the Naib and the Sirdar agree in the finding and sentence they will together dispose of the case. Should they differ in opinion the case will be referred to His Highness the Khan for final orders, which will be binding on the Naib and Sirdar. Should a Brahooee escape to any tribe after committing an offence the Sirdar of that tribe is responsible to apprehend him, and to dispose of his offence in accordance with the procedure j ust recorded. 4. Protection and aid to be rendered to the civil power by the military.- His Highness the Khan has the power to place troops in any part of the Khanate, whether inhabited by the Brahooees or not, for the protection of the civil power.' In the event of any tribe or portion of a tribe disobeying a lawful order of the Khan, the Sirdars will be called upon in accordance with ancient law and precedent to cause the oflending tribe or portion of a tribe to submit. In the event of its being necessary to resort to arms to enforce submission, the Sirdars will aid the Khan with their followers in accordance with old custom, but before war on the tribe or portion of a tribe is declared, the Khan will obtain first the sanction of the British Government before waging it. In the event of the Naibs using the troops stationed with them contrary to the procedure laid down for their guidance, and that of the Sirdars in the rules herein recorded, the complainant must refer the matter direct to His Highness the Khan, who will inquire and do justice. Should the Sirdars consider that the Khan's decision is unjust, they will not raise the standard of revolt, but will first refer the matter to the British Government for decision.BALUCHISTAN—APPENDIX NO. III. xlix BALUCHISTAN. APPENDIX No. III. (T ranslation.) M emoeandum of the proceedings of a J irga regarding the periodical settle ment of cases arising between the subjects of P ersian B aluchistan ancl K alati M akran. A combined Jirga of Persian and Baluchistan Sardars was held at Magas on the 16th February 1902 to consider the means that should be taken in future to provide for the settlement of cases arising between Persian and Makran subjects. The following were present:— On behalf of the Governor-General— (1) Mirza Fateh Ullah Khan, Saiyid-nl-Saltanah, and Naib-ul-Hukumah of Kerman and Persian Baluchistan ; (2) Hasham Khan, Satwat-ul-Mumalik, Amir-i-Panj, Deputy Governor of Bampur ; (3) Mir Abdulla Khan, Hakim of Dizak and Jalak ; (4) Mir Ghulam Easul Khan, Hakim of Sib and Soran. On behalf of the Political Agent, Kalat (1) Kazi Fakir Ahmed Khan, Native Assistant to the Political Agent, Kalat; (2) Sardar Ghaus Bakhsh Khan, Eaisani, Sardar of Sarawan ; (3) Sardar Mir Mehrullah Khan, Nazim of Mekran ; (4) Sardar Mehrab Khan, Gichki; (5) Khan Bahadur Muhammad Hasan Khan, Gichki. After a careful consideration of the question the Jirga express the opinion that hitherto border criminals and others, inclined to take the law into their own hands in the settlement of local disputes, have been under the impression that offences committed in foreign territory are not likely to be taken notice of by their own Sardars and officials and that on return to their own side of the border they are secured from pursuit and other after -consequences. This belief has been the cause of much lawlessness and disorder on the border, and it is time that all badmashes should be strictly brought to account for their crimes and all border disputes taken up and enquired into as promptly as possible to p^ out their leading to serious disturbance. The Jirga accordingly make the following recommendations— 1. That the Nazim of Makran and the Deputy Governor of Bampur should porrespond with regard to all matters, petitions, and complaints arising betweenI BALUCHISTAN—APPENDIX NO. JIJ. the subjects of the two Governments residing on the frontier and arrange for the redress of their grievances. If the cases can be settled by correspondence, well and good. 2. But it is possible that there will always bo many matters whether with regard to border offences and disputes or otherwise outstanding between the Nazin. and Deputy Governor which could not be decided by correspondence. It is, therefore expedient that the two above mentioned officers should meet each other and have the cases decided in their presence. The Jirga, therefore, most strongly recommend that the two officers should meet near the border once a year without fail. The best places for the meeting are Pishin and Kohak and the meeting .can be held alternately at each place. Next year, 1903—1320 H., it will be at Pishin on the 1st Burj-i-Jadi, corresponding to 1st January 1903, and in 1904%1321 H., at Kohat on the 1st Burj-i-asad, corresponding to 1st August, and so on in each alternate year until such time as the Kerman and Baluchistan* authorities should consider the meetings no longer necessary. 3. On arrival at the place of meeting a combined Jirga of Persian and Makran Sardars will assemble to dispose of all cases which the Deputy Governor and the Nazim may respectively wish settled in their presence. Each official will of course have present with him all complainants and defendants concerned in the cases which are to be decided and they should make every endeavour to carry into eSect the awards given by the Jirga before their return to their head-quarters. To prevent cases falling through owing to the absence of the parties the Deputy Governor and Nazim should supply each other in good time before the meeting with a complete list showing all cases they wish discussed. 'i The Jirga in disposing of cases should endeavour to render the settlements as final and as acceptable to both parties as possible, and they should, there fore, follow as far as they can the custom of the country and the rules of ' Shariat.' 4. The Deputy Governor and the Nazim will be responsible for the carrying out of the awards given by the Jirga against the people of their respective districts, 5. '1 he scope of these meetings and accompanying Jirgas will include the settle ment of all cases of a purely local character such as cattle theft, afEiays, the ofiences of individual badmashes, women cases, the raiding of small kafilas by small parties of local tribesmen, etc. More important offences such as the looting of large kafilas by large gangs, organised raids from one country into the other will have to be referred to higher authority on either side. In any case of doubt as to whether a matter should be dealt with or not, reference should be made by the Deputy Governor to the Governor-General of Kerman and by the Nazim to the Political Agent, Kalat.

M emorandum of an arrangement come to in conversation between the G overjvor- G eneral of K erman and P ersian B aluchistan and the P olitical A gent, K alat , on the subject of the importation of B reech- L oading rifles and ammunition into B ritish and P ersian B aluchistan. The Political Agent informed the Governor-General that an extensive traffic in arms is being carried on at Maskat and other Persian Gulf ports, that the arms landed are breech-loaders of the Martini-Henri, Lee Metford and Mauser patterns— all arms of the most advanced and effective types—^and that these arms are coining rapidly into the possession of the tribesmen all along both sides of the Perso -Baluch border. In a very few years, if the traffic continues, the tribesmen Will be as well armed as either the Persian or British troops and the control of the country, difficult enough already, will become well nigh impossible or will at least demand the employ ment of a largely increased number of troops. There is a grave political danger underlying this re-armament of the people with modern weapons in place of their old and useless matchlocks. Should these wild and lawless tribes once think that they are in a position to cope with their masters on equal terms, there may be no limit to their excesses or to the distance from the border to which their depredations may extend. The Political Agent further informed the Governor-General that in Kalat-i- Makran the strictest watch is now being kept over this traffic and all arms imported into the country without permission are at once confiscated by the Khan's officials. The Governor-General agreed with the views above expressed and said he was prepared to do all in his power to put a stop to the traffic on his side of the border. To this end he will adopt the following measures :— (1) a notification will be issued and published throughout Persian Baluchistan (including the seaboard) that in future all breech- loading rifles of whatever pattern and ammunition for the same brought into the country, except under the written sanction of the Governor-General of Kerman, will be at once confiscated and the importer or person in whose possession the rifle or rifles and ammuni tion may be discovered severely punished ; (2) the Deputy Governor of Bampur and the leading Sardars of the district will be held responsible that the terms of the notification at (1) above are strictly carried out, the Deputy Governor being responsible for the whole district and each Sardar or headman for his particular sab-district or village ;BALUOHTSTAN—APPENDIX NO. IV. liii &lt;3) the Deputy Governor to at once ascertain and report to the Governor- General the nurabef of breech-loading rifles now in the Rampur district (excluding, of course, Government arms carried by soldiers and officials) and the names of the persons who own them ; (4) the Deputy Governor to submit an annual report to the Governor- General, showing any changes that may have occurred in the list referred to at (3) during the past year ; /5) the Governor-General will arrange to have a strict watch kept on all the custom and other ports, big or small, along the Kerman and Baluchistan portion of the coast with a view to all arms illicitly imported whether by traders or by private individuals being imme diately confiscated ; (6) all arms and ammunition confiscated will be forwarded to Kermaa and the Governor-General should be informed of the punishment inflicted in each case of unauthorised importation ; and (7) with reference to the list at (3), if the Governor-General considers that any particular Sardar has in his possession more breech-loading rifles than are reasonably necessary for the purposes of supporting his dignity or securing him against attack from his enemies, he will cause such Sardar to deliver up to him all such rifles as are con sidered to be in excess of his requirements. Equally any breech- loading rifle found to be in the possession of a person, who by hia character or position in life is thought by the Governor-General unfitted to be trusted with a breech-loading rifle, such rifle will be taken out of his possession.
