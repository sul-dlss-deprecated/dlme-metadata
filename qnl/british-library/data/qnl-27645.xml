His Jxcollency the Shaikh of Kuwait cane to see me this morning with regard to a letter he had received from Major Prank Holmes about the oil con cession agreement. In the course of conversation, it transpired that Major Holmes had put forward the sug ’estion that if H.E. was agreeable to the abandoning of the nationa lity clause from, the agreement the British overn- ment would also bo agreeable to do so. The Shaikh, however, replied that if the British Government were willing to let this question drop, ho would abide by their decision as he had implicit faith and trust in is Majesty’s government, but as T - T is Majesty’s Government required such a clause he would insist that it 1x3 inserted From this it would appear that M. M. was weakening though he repeatedly told me that he r : ould not agree unless the nationality clause was inserted in the agreement, and he gave as Wis reasons the same as those he had given Colonel Biscoe who embodied them in his No.40-T dated at Bahrain 9th November 1950. I certainly gathered, that should II.M.Government decide to give up this clause then, the Shaikh, though acquiescing, would himself put forward the above mentioned reasons as a clause in the BgBeement f and this he has stated in his reply to Major TTolr.es. The Shaikh 'bo my mind, appeared a bit wo ried owing to Major Holmes having said that he the Shaikh had promised him verbally and now he required it ir Major T.C.W.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushirei © writing. This, I feel sire, is only ahother of this gentleman’s artifices to gain his object, but I don’t think tho Shaikh can be hustled. 7e have now in writing the Shaikh’s decision, but as it is only a draft letter, I will obtain a copy of the actual reply he sends Major Holmes. If there is anything I may have omitted to do in the present instance, please let me know and also if you need any further information. I received today your P.0. No. 316-S to C &gt;lonel Dickson from him for filing in the oil file and I thank you fbr your kind remarks about myself. Tou may rest assured that in all matters and especidly in the present one, I shall endeavour to do my very best and give all the help I can.Confidential B.O.ITo.316-S of 1931. British Residency, Bushire, the 2nd June 1931 Reference correspondence ending with your .0,0 letter -No.72 of the 25th May 1931, to Bradshaw, I am sorry that I have not had an opportunity of seeing you before you left, and that also I shall not have the benefit of your support at Kuwait during my t enure of Bushire* However, I am sure that Greenway will prove a good substitute. It is curious that you and I have never met consider ing that we were alongside one another more or less in -Iraq in neighbouring districts for some time, and have now been together in the Gulf. However, I hope we shall meet when you come back from leave, I have just been going through the Kuwait Oil Concession which is filled with Holmes’ activities* Colonel Biscoe before leaving also put me wise to these. The situation, as I understand it, is that the Shaikh insists on the inclusion of the 'British Control Clause', which of course we are all out for, and that the Eastern and General Syndicate are not prepared to swallow it; which is all to the good. If at any time -3ai did accept it then the ether objections to their proposed agreement pointed out by you and endorsed by Colonel Biscoe could be taken up. The Colonel H.R.P. Dicks on,C.I*E 4 PA OS'The present danger apparently is that Holmes may renew the ’’attacks” on the Shaikh to waive his objection to the ’’Control Clause”, but I imagine that the Shaikh will stand firm; in any case Greenway will be on the sxjot and advise me of any developments.

Sir, With reference to your letter of 31st January 1931 (79173/30) addressed to this Company regarding its application for the grant of an Oil Concession in Kuwait, I art instructed to inform you that our representative went in larch 1931 to Kuwait and discussed with the Sheikh of Kuwait the question of the British Control cause, which according to your letter, he has insisted should he includ d in any concession which he might grant in respect of his territory. Our representative found upon his arrival in Kuwait, after some discussion r egarding trie British Control clause, that tne Sheikh was willing to omit the British Control clause, provided His Majesty’s Government were willing to agree tne omission. It is the opinion of our representative that the Sheikh has been influenced by the pressing demands of the people to develop without delay the natural resources of Kuwait and the severe trade depression and unemployment experienced during the past two years within the Sheikh’s territories have accentuated the necessity to promptly meet these demands. I enclose a photostatic copy of a letter from the Sheikh of Kuwait, dated 2nd July 1931, addressed to iajor Fiank Holmes, our Eastern representative, in wnioh letter the Sueikh clearly establisnes ^is willingness to omit the British Control clause from the c oncessi onconcession which he is willing to grant to my Company, provided H.r. Government will agree to the omission of same* The Sheikh is fully aware that the Concession is to be exploited by American interests* I am therefore instructed to ask if you will now kindly notify the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that the objection to which you refer in your letter of 31st January 1931, is removed and that H.M* Government has no objection to the Sheikn of Kuwait granting an Oil Concession to the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited from which the British Control clause is omitted.

Dear Laithwaite, I enclose, for your edification, a copy of a despatch whic . we have had from Bushire on the subject of the oil negotiations that have been proceeding in Kuwait. Before any action could be taken on receipt of t is despatch, 1'r. Janson of the Eastern and General Syndicate called on Sir John Shuckburgh and stated that they interpreted the Shaikh’s letter as intimating that subject to the approval of his Majesty’s Government, he was prepared to waive the condition about British control. He went on t o say that before taking any action ne wes anxious to know what could be done to meet our wishes and that if it was made plain to the Americans that His I ajesty’s Government was opposed to gun American concession, they would probably accept the inevitable and ring their negotiati ms to an end. Sir John Shuckburgh told them that the best step would be to write in officially, in which case we would consider what could be done, and ossibly arrange for an informal discussion, but refused to commit i.imself on that or any other point. We have not yet got trie official letter but Colonel Dickson came in on Saturday and I snowed him the despatch and its enclosures. He said tnat he was not at all sure tnat the interpretation put on the Shaikh’s letter was the correct one and that it was open to the interpretation ’*1 am sick of being bothered by you, so go and talk to tne British Government, and if y u can get them to agree to anything, come back and we will see about it*, and in view of this, I think you ought to ;ave the stuff now, even though we have not yet got any letter from the Eastern and General Syndicate. Dickson was generally ofof the opinion that the Syndicate^ as represented by Holmes, were very persistent and slightly underhand negotiators* Tne matter is complicated by the fact that His Majesty*a Government has recently decided as a g neral rule not to insist on the 'British control' clause even in Colonies, so it would be rather illogical to insist upon it in this particular case but we can wait and see* t Yours etc., Sd» J.I5*W.

Before Armstrong went he told me that if Holmes 1 company did not treat him handsomely as regards pay and gratuity, he would 'blab” (his expression) and he had very much to give away he said. Aparently he was done well, and is now in Somaliland boring for Government. 4 Then I saw you I mentioned that there were traces of oil in the sea close to one of the Islands owned by Kuwait,I have since verified from the Sheikh that ”KARU” Island is the place. Another interesting point which possibly may have something behind it is the fact that according to local Arabs the ancient name of Has al Ajuza which lies close by the Sheikhs palace was 'Bandar Gauz”.

It will be necessary, as you are aware, to obtain the approval of the Shaikh, and it is presumed that you will approach him through the Political Agent at Kuwait. The Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent are being informed of your intentions. You are, no doubt, already aware that another concern has been negotiating with the Shaikh for some time past for an oil concession in his territories. The question whether any payment to the Shaikh of Kuwait will be required is one for settlement between your repre sentative and the Shaikh, and His Majesty*s Government are not in a position to give any undertaking on the subject.

Sir, X have the honour to inform you that I have received inti nation that lajcr F. Heines is now on his way t© y Kxiwait from l n^land, and has probably by now reached Baghdad* B© telegraphed this fact to hie Persian Agent in the town. 2* In connection with this individual’s activities, X have to report that I recently had two long talks with His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait on the subject of his much die* cussed letter of 2 nd July to Kajcr Holmes. 2. As I suspected was the case, the Shaikh explained that Major Holmes worried him so often and so long, that to get rid of him gracefully, he told him to go and fight the matter out with His Majesty's Government. He felt confident when he wrote the letter that His Majesty's ovorn- oent would see him through and give the Eastern and Gene ml Syndicate a clear and definite refusal to allow any agreement without a British Nationality Clause. He felt, he said, that this would be the easiest way out in dealing with this very per sis tent person. Arab politeness, he said, forbade that he should rudely 'turn him down', especially m Major Holmes had twice mad© handsome personal gifts to him in the shape of a £ 1,000 Cunbeam car in 1929, and Ks 10,000A in cash in 1950. The Shaikh added that Major Holmes was such a 'difficult' parson at taking a hint that nothing short of deliberate rudeness to his face, would have had any effect. Arab etiquette of course forbade such a course, especially as Major HolmesHolmes was a kind of guest In Kuwait, so he had deliberately decided to writ© the letter he did, put ting his reliance on Hi© Majesty*s Goverrment to step in and do the needful. 4. Lastly tbs GhaUcfe assured me that the meaning Therefor© if you and your Company cces to { of the last paragraph of his an a&amp;reeaaat with His Majesty 1 a Govern- Snt on the elauses mentioned to you by } letter (which incidentally me and should they (His Majesty’s Govern- I meat) allow you to omit them, then there \ should read as per translation will have to be a fur ther discussion i with you * i in the margin, and not in tfc© free way given by Major I olraas’ lawyer) was that in the possibly unforseen event of His Majesty’s Got am- meat weakening in the matter of the w Kattonality Clause', be the shaikh would himself insert a clause in any agreement granted to the effect that the Company must be entirely and altogether a British on© as ha had already verbally assured Colonel Biocoo (vide Bushire confidential Ho* 40-T dated Bahrain 9tfc November 1930/ to H.M’s Secretary of State for the Colonies)* The same point was emphasised in Dr* Greenway’s demi-offi cial letter Ho. 87 dated 2 nd July to the J on’bl© the Poll t leal Kesid exit * 5. Whether the Shaikh really meant to do what he says he intended 1 s' open to conjecture, r^ut knowing as I do that he is easily swayed and not possessed of much strength of character, it would, in xsy definite opinion, be far too risky for us to leave it at this, and I still think that it must be made quite clear to the Shaikh that we expect him to insist on the in sertion at the 'Nationality Clause'. 6 . A point,which in fairness to the Shaikh,must not be f ergot ton, in judging him over the letter business, is that he has had it in writing, vide Bushin confidential letter l;o*290-3 dated 4th August 1928 to the iolitied Agent, that His Majesty’s Government would always insist that any oil agreement oono to wittK syndicate must have e British Nationality Clause in it. % was again told this in 1930, vide the Fon’ble th '2the Political Resident's confidential deni-official No* 393-3 dated let August 1950. He therefore, I think had no reason to suppose that Ilia Majesty's Oorermr^cnt would recede fmn this view. Anothar point worth mentioning perhaps, is that Major Maines (according to the dhaikh) again and again rubbed it in directly end by suggestion that he, Major Heines, had had it on the highest authority in the Colonial Office that if i&amp;e dhciikh did not went the insertion of the Nationality Clouse, Hi© I.a jo sty's nwmwmm would not insist because they would under- take to see that his interests would and would be properly protected by other dlplcmtle means. B» f rhc Lhailth, though one cannot entirely excuse him of weakness and wasoillation in this matter is really a simple Bedouin at heart, and there is some excuse for his haring succumbed to the continuous and direct attack of a mn of Holmes' calibre* 9.

Sir We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Mr Starling*» letter of the 20th January, P.D./98 and to state for your confidential information that the results of recent test borings on the Persian Coast south of Bushire give us some reason to think that the prospects of the existence of petroleum in Koweit territory are perhaps somewhat less remote than have hitherto appeared to be the case. In these circumstances we should be prepared, subject to the approval of the Shaikh of Koweit and the concurrence of H.M.’s Government, to send a small part of geologists to Koweit in the autumn to make a thorough examination of the surface geology. le anticipate that a reconnaissance on the above lines would take several months and we assume that the Shaikh of Ko^it would be prepared to give us every facility in the matter without requiring any payment from us other than out-of-pocket expenses incurred.

(Mines Department) Dean Stanley Street, Millbank, lestrainster, London, S.W.l. 10th September, 1931. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to refer to your letter of September 4th, No.89178/31, enclosing a draft letter to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in regard to the Company’s proposal to undertake a geological survey in Kuwait, and to request you to inform Mr Secretary Thomas that he concurs generally in the terms of the draft letter. It appears to the Secretary for Mines, however, that it would be desirable to make some reference in the proposed reply to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s inquiry as to whether they can be given every facility for carrying out the survey without being required to make any payment. It is in accordance with usual practice to make no charge, or at least only a nominal fee, for the right to carry out a geological survey in undeveloped territory. In India no Exploration Licence appears to be necessary. The India M lines Regulations” state t! The issue of Exploration Licences authorising the surface of the land to be searched for minerals having been discontinued, the surface of unoccupied and unreserved land which is the property of the Grovernment may be freely Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, S.W.l.freely searched without authority^. As far as this Department can ascertain, the only fee charged to the Anglo-Gaxon Petroleum Company in respect of the Geological Survey which it recently carried out in Somaliland was a nominrljone of £5. In Egypt ixploration Government is in principle free upon all unoccupied and unreserved land although exclusive rights to explore in certain specified areas may exceptionally be granted to approved applicants for which no fee appears to be specified in the Mining Regulations. It is true that in Trinidad a scale of fees is laid down for use in connsction with Exploration Licences ranging from £5u per annum for areas not exceeding 250 acres to £1,250 per annum for areas in excess of 100,0)0 acres, but it is suggested that no comparison can fairly be drawn between a well- developed country such as Trinidad where oil is known to exist and a large oil industry has already been built up and desert territory such as Kuwait which is comparatively unexplored and to which the sending of an expedition must involve considerable expense. The Secretary for Mines recognises, however, that a difficulty may arise in that the Eastern and General Syndicate have already offered, in the draft concession which they have submitted, to pay a fee of Rs 30,0)0 under Exploration Licence (on signature of the Agreement) and Rs.20,000 annually thereafter although the Concession if granted would have covered rights to a Prospecting Licence and a Mining Lease. It is suggested that in communicating with the Resident in the D ersian Gulf and the Political Agent at Kuwait the considerations referred to above may be brought to their attention. TheThe Secretary for Mines considers that in view of the difficulty of inducing British Companies to undertake exploratory work under present conditions, it is important that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should be given every encouragement and all facilities which can reasonably be afforded them. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office and India Office. 1 am, etc. (Sgd) F.C. Starling.[y J ^aptaabsr 1 89178/31. Gentlemen, With, reference to jour letter of the 25th of . . A .

K-Cjl ^ The Bahrain Government have been complaining for some time past that the A.F.O.C have been profiteering with regard to the petrol and kerosene they sell in Bahrain. The price is more then double what it sells for in Persia and half as much again as the price in England and. they are determined to put an end to the monopoly by one me am or another. As you are awa-re, Russian steamers are not allowed to call at Bahrain,consequently we have no supply of Russian petrol but,I believe,they call at Kuwait and if so there is no reason why petrol should not be sent down by launch from Kuwait and so break this ring. Would you please let me know whether Russian j&gt;«^t is available in Kuwait^and whether you think this scheme which I have outlined is practicable or not.

Very Confidential„ Notes on a general conversation held between the F.A. and the Sheikh on 10, 10. 3j. as a result of Colonial Office letter,No dated 14th Sept. 1931, forwarded under Bushires No. 634 S. dated 30.9.31. * (a) (b) (c) (d) The Political Agent commenced l&gt;y saying that he wished to have a plain heart to heart talk with the Sheikh, and that the latter must not mind if he spoke quite frankly. He then in general terms made the following points to the Sheikh. (a) A letter had been received fron the Colonial Office on the 9th October,( letter of 14th Sept 1931 to Political Resident was the one P .A. had in mind ) from which it was obvious that His Majestys Secretary of State felt surprised at the contents of the Sheikhs letter (of 1st July) to Major Holmes. (b) It was also fairly obvious that H.M.Gr. (although they did not say so in so many words) believed that Ma^or Holmes had deliberately waited for the permanent incumbent Colonel Dickson to go on leave, and then had somehow or othwr got round him (the Sheikh) and in doing so had cleverly bluffed Dr G-reenway who could not be expected to fully appreciate the considered policy of H.M.Gr. in the matter, in to acquies- ing in the wording of the letter, which he the Sheikh had sent to Major Holmes. (c) H.M.G-. had received three despatched from the Honble. the Political Resident, No.36 dated 17.9.30 No.42 ' 6.10.30 No.40 T. ” 9.11 .30 which not only showed the undesirability and danger to himself the Sheikh of Kuwait of a concession to an American concern being granted without clear and definite safeguards, but also showed in the plainest terms that he the Sheikh had repeatedly stated and in most vigorous terms that he would never grant any concession to Major Holmes without tbe M Nationality Clause ^belng Inserted. (d) The Sheikhs sudden apparent M volte face'’ had mystified and annoyed H.M.Gr., and of course had somewhat astonished the Honble, the Political Resident who with Colonel Dickson2 . c% Colonel Dickson had been shewn the letter in London. (e) The Political Agent reminded the Sheikh that he had been told in 1928 and in 1930 that H.M.G. wanted the '’Nationality Clause inserted', but that it had suited H.M.G.'s purpose that he himself (the Sheikh) should be the person to tell Major Holmes this. Now,he, the Sheikh had thrown the burden of saying this on H.M.G. which of course put the latter in an awkward position. Seeing that they had persistently been telling Major Holmes’s. American backers that -it was the Sheikh who wanted the “Nationality Clause' and that they were not prepared to ask him to change his views. (f) The Sheikh in spite of the e ^ : ^ o:r ^ c | a ^ v ^^ r i-S ues of his neighbours had earned the confidence of H.M.G. and the A u-ovt. of India( as instance the conferring on him of the K.C.I.E. and the recovery of £3000/- from Bin Saud.) H.M.G. also appeared firm in their resolve to see justice done in the matter of (a) the Sheikhs Date Gardens (b) Bin Sauds Blockade. It would be the greatest pity therefore if he, the Sheikh in anyway now alienated H.M.G.’s sympathy and support by opposing their well known wishes and doing anything foolish in the matter of the Eastern General Syndicate. (g) The Sheikh would clearly be:acting in accordance with the wishes of H.M.G. if he once again told Major Holmes that he could have nothing to do with any 'ageement ' unless he ,Major Holmes agreed to insert the Nationality Clause and such course would clear up all misunderstanding and suspicion in the minds of everyone concerned, (h) Colonel Biscoe was due to arrive in Kuwait on Oct, 22 nd and the first thing he probably would do would be to enquire hin the Sheikh, about his apparent change of mind( as enn\ciated in his letter of 1st July to Major Holmes.) (i) (i) The Political Agent then suggested to the Sheikh that was so Important in his own interests to clear himself4 received the necessary assurance did he send it off. He had in no way at all altered his views about the Nationality Clause and the necessity for its insertion, and he still stood by every single word that he had spoken to Colonel Biseoe on the subject. He had then assured the Honble, the Political Resident that his honour and the interests of his State were beyond purchase, and that unless Major Holmes agreed to the insertion of the Clause in question, that he, the Sheikh, would ask Major Holmes to leave his State, as he desired to have no further discussion with him over the question of his agreement. The Sheikh lastly said he preferred the second alternative of the P.A*s sugesstion,(para(i) 2 above) as he desired personally to explain how the mistake arose to the Honble: the Political Resident^and assure him, that he had no intention of going back on his word, also that he was as determined as ever that no foreign concern should get a footing in his territory unless under complete and proper safeguards. In other wards that it should be under the direct control of the British G-overnment. The Sheikh terminated the interview by grasping the P.A’s hand in most friendly manner and saying, '’Trust me to keep on the right side of my G-overnment ’’hakumti” , If I were given a million pounds I would not barter away the protection and the good will of H.M.G-. which in the past has seen Kuwait safely through every danger^ and will I know in the future do the same.16th October, 1931. My dear Dickson, Many thanks for your letter of 25th September and its useful enclosure, much of which was new to me. You will no doubt hear further on the matter shortly from Abadan, who have instructions to enter on negotiations with the Shaikh. All we want to do at present is to examine the area thoroughly from a geological point of view, in the light of our fairly ex tensive knowledge of adjoining areas. We hope, of course, that the Shaikh will not in the meanwhile commit himself to other parties - but we ask for no formal undertaking. A proper geological examination is an expensive matter and I am assuming, I hope rightly, that His Excellency will not ask for more than out-of- pocket expenses for guards, etc. With renewed thanks and all good wishes. Yours sincerely, -1, Lt.-Col. H.R.P. Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, KOWEI T.Confidential. D.O. No.133. The Agency, Kuwait, Persian Gulf. 4 . 11 . 31 . Many thanks for your letter of 16th October. Blscoe has heard officially from Abadan about the A.P.O.C's proposed geological survey. As he spent five days recently in Kuwait on his way out from Sngland, to avoid having to do quarantine in Bushire, he took the opportunity himself of sounding the Sheikh on the matter, with I am glad to say satisfactory results. It remains now to get a written undertaking from the Sheikh, In applying for which I shall mention that the company is prepared to pay out of pocket expenses for guards etc. If I may suggest it I think your Abadan people would do well these days to start quietly ingratiating themselves with Sheikh Ahmad, as a counter blast to the strong efforts Holmes makes in this respect. The latter has”pull rt over you, in that he has taken a house here, and loses no opportunity in trying to shew that he has money behind him. In other words he makes a'* splash spends money on local charities etc. and regulary keeps the Sheikh happy with small gifts, such as cigarette boxes, silver it trinkets etc. etc. He has of course given him several expensive gifts in the past such as a six cylinder Sunbeam Car, Rs.10,000/- in cash, and now an eight cylinder Bulck I believe Is on order. I do not suggest that you should spend money, but your people could do much to get the Sheikh on their side, if they would for instance sell their parafin and petrol cheaper here. The Sheikh tells me he recently asked Abadan to meet him in the matter, but got no change, and he feels rather bitter l about it. As a result he is encouraging the sale of either pirated A.P .0.0. petrol, or Soviet stuff, I dont know which it is, at Rs.3/- a tin against your Rs.5/4 a tin.Bahrain I know feels equally sore about this, and Holmes of course goes about saying what a shame It is, and promises wonderful1 changes when he gets his Bahrain oil going. It may interest you to know thajc on the 25th October Holmes received a cable from his head office, to the effect that the A.P.O.C. had obtained sanction from the Colonial Office to approach the Sheikh about the proposed survey. Holmes immediately rushed round and told the Sheikh. The latter told me. This looks like leakage. Hoping you are well. Yours sincerely. P.S. Should your people ever think of a gift for Sheikh Ahmad, you could not do better than suggest a good 12 u search light with Dynamo for his Yacht’ 1 Kuwait M which is run by a 75h.p. Thornycroft engine. I know he is very keen on one, but does not know from where or how to get it.( Received under Government of India endorsement Ro.

Major Holmes had for some time past been pestering the Shaikh both directly and through intermediaries to come to terms* His methods are somewhat devious and at time he undoubtedly draws the long bow in his endeavour to impress the Shaikh with his own importance and his influence among high personages in London and America* He has done a certain amount of • propaganda 1 among the notables of Kuwait and has assured them that the grant of a concession would bring much money into the principality, and during the present difficult crisis he has found the soil already sown, and deputations have visited the Shaikh urging him to come to terms with Major Holmes, and finally the Shaikh has received two handsome presents from Major Holmes, first a Sunbeam oar and later Hs*10,€00* Finally, just before he was leaving Kuwait, Major Holmes came and called on the Shaikh in person and again made a final effort to get something in writing out of him, and the Shaikh yielding to his importunity and anxious to get rid of him gave him the letter which certainly does not commit him to anything definite but is of that evasive style in which the Arab mind seems to delight and may be interpreted In different senses by the writer and the addressee* The Shaikh himself explained the letter by saying that the meaning of the last paragraph was that in the possibly unforeseen event of His Majesty’s Government weakening in the matter of the ••*9*? -a- the nationality clause he (the Shaikh) would himself insert the clause In any agreement granted to the effect that the company must be entirely and altogether a British one. The Shaikh bad spoken in this sense to Doctor Greenway, the Acting Political Agent, before sending the letter and I think he certainly felt that the letter did not commit him one way or the other; his explanation however is not convincing and 1 think the long and short of it is that he wanted to get rid of hey or Holmes’ importunities, and therefore gave an evasive reply which really committed him to nothing and left the matter in suspense, 4 , X took the opportunity of reminding Shaikh Ahmad that he had all the advantages of an independent ruler, since we did not interfere in the internal affairs of his State, and that he must accept some of the responsibilities of that position, X am however quite convinced that the shaikh really does not desire the presence of an American company in hie State, and will not willingly agree to any abrogation of the nationality clause, and I submit that there is absolutely no need for u® to bring any pressure to bear upon him in this matter, his excellency told me that just before hie interview with me a deputation consisting of some of his relations and leading men of the town had called on him again urging him, in view of the grave distress prevailing, to c orae to some agreement with H&amp;jor Holmes* But he had given them a very short reply and informed them that in this matter he intended to take his own line, 5. He is very gratified indeed to learn that the Aagla-lersian Oil Company contemplated a geological survey of the State, a fact which apparently reached the ears of Maj or Holmes and had caused him some consternation* l trust the Angl ©-Persian Oil Company will not delay in carrying out the survey, «•*4» 4~ #urTs/ f ihich will strengtiien the &gt;haikh t e hauda and # if Uie survey ia successful and results in a definite application by the Anglo-Pereian Oil Company for &amp; concession, it will relieve the British authorities from the somewhat delicate position in which they have been placed by the activities of Major Holmes on behalf of American interests* 6* 1 should like to mention in conclusion that the Shaikh made a most earnest appeal to me that His Majesty's Government should take some steps to relieve the blockade which £s pressing so hard upon this small principal!ty* He reiterated that he had consistently endeavoured to follow their advice and to meet their wishes, and that in return he did think that it was incumbent upon them to relieve him and his people from the grip of Bin Baud* X am sending a copy of this despatch to the Govern ment of India* X have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient, humble servant, sd/~ H.V.Biscoe, It* Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,C0HFID15NTXAL.

I have given them out to the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Europeans. The work at the borehole has progressed wonderfully. The depth reached is 835 feet. A series of bands of oil-bearing shales have been encountered in drilling. These showings of oil are very encouraging and are favourable indications of oil being struck at a lower depth.

Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, London, E. C. 2 . 25th November, 1931. My dear Dickson, Many thanks for yours of 4 th November. I have passed on to Abadan your views as to making love to the Shaikh: it is not hov/ever so easy a matter for us as for Holmes. As to petrol prices, our Kuwait price is 5/1: the Basrah price is 4/12: our present price at Bushire works out at 4 /-. No shipments from Soviet or other sources have, as far as we know, been made to the Arab coast, and I can only suppose that fluctua tions in exchange rates between Krans and rupees are responsible, and the reduced rate is not likely to endure. We cannot reduce our rates at Kuwait by r s# 2 /- as you suggest, without making a simultaneous reduction in neighbouring countries, and that is not a course we can afford to contemplate. As to your paragraph 9 , I am unable to suggest v/hen the leakage occurred. The C.O. sa^nctioned our approaching the Shaikh by letter dated September 23rd, so the new^s percolated very slowly.

This wat«r Major Holut&amp;a wa« of opinion came from the Persian iioimtains and not from tlia hl&amp;tlimiv of Jejass and Nej4l as hitherto supposed, and passing under the Persian Gulf and the lower end of Iraq, at a great depth (as instance the heat ) was eventually farced up again on the line described in the preceding para by a sort of fault In the aarth*s surface which took the form, to use an easily understood simile, of a groat rocky wall or cliff, which cams up from a great depth mid ran in a North and South Kasterly direction following the general lino of the ' ©rsian Gulf and the valley of the Euphrates. 6.

This lino whi^ h he said followed the same course as the water springs mentioned in para 4 above, Major Holmes tms of opt- nion^ formed the Smitliem edge of the 'Gil' bearing xoue or line, and it was close to this line that the underground cliff so to apeak ran* 7.

I am afraid that the pric e Question is a sore one which present circumstances do not permit us to correct at the moment.

I am of course not in a position to say at the moment to what extent we shall be able to assist the Sheikh in this matter, but there is no harm in obtaining all the necessary information. Your telegram has just been received, and I must thank you again for so kindly offering the Survey party your hospitality on their arrival. This they will be only too glad to accept I am sure, but they will of course make all necessary arrange ments as soon as possible with our Agent, and you must not let them trouble you unduly.

KUWAIT OIL# Reference para.r&amp;ph 4 # Oil interests are unlike ordinary commercial concerns. They have infinitely larger resources frequently wield much political influence and demand mu c h more extensive concessions# For instance in draft concession submitted by Holmes to Shaikh he sought not merely permission to explore and prospect for oil but to construct roads, railways, ports, lighthouses, telegraphs and telephones and to establish coaling stations. If foreign companies’ operations approached scale ox Anglo-Persian Oil Company establishments at Abadan there would be enormous influx of foreign labour, much of it of an undesirable type. Sirnikh could certainly not exercise control and we should have to assume charge. After company had obtained control of all means of communication transport etc. in state Shaikh would be puppet in their hands. mile I do not attach much importance to risk of isolated incidents of which foreign nationals would have to take their chance there is always possibility of dis turbances on large scale such as occurred four years ago and as may well recur if Ibn Saud’s kingdom breaks up. In such event Hoyal Havy could not protect establishments in hinterland and foreign interests might well call on their own ^overnmen„ fo. prot ect i on, • •protection, and very difficult situation would arise. Further if foreign interests obtained footing all down Arab littoral their Government might consider it desirable for their warships to show the flag. In any case Arab Shaikhs would in short time look' to foreign interests who would doubtless not stint /V money than to British Government as dispensers of favours and we should lose to large extent that influence which we now exercise and the whole position which we have labo/riously built up would be threatened. Having regard to strategic importance of Persian Gulf nowadays it would seem Essential to avfcid this risk. 3 . As regards particular case of Kuwait discussions ^ hitherto have been -feerbal. I would suggest that Political Ao-ent should write to Shaikh to effect that his letter to Holmes is somewhat ambiguous and seems t o be at variance with the views expressed verbally to me. His Ma^3esty s government would therefore be glad to know whether Shaikh is !&gt;r is net- prepared to grant concession to company controlled by foreign interests. If he replies that he is not prepared to do so I presume it is not the intention of His Majesty’s Government to force him and reply could be communicated to Americans, emphasis at the same time being laid on his independent status and fact that we do not interfere in his internal affairs. - RESIJEHT -Confi dential^. /i f ^ J).0.

As you will see, the Shaikh*s stupid letter to Holmes has fairly put us in the soup. xt is difficult to he angry with Greenway in view of his lack of experience but the whole business is very annoying, what has happened is that Holmes has informed his American ffiends that the shaikh is willing to give him the concession but that the nritish Government are standing in the way. uil interests in America are of course enormously powerful and the American Embassy in London have immediately tackled the foreign uffi'-e on the subject and practically charged us with trying to get the Americans o\x£ of the Gulf for our own purposes so that we could get the monopoly of the oil. fhe foreign office ox course are very sensitive on the subject of we are never anxious to define or emphasise position in the Gulf, and, as you will see, would like to waive the .Nationality Clause, on the other hand are standing up for it as t.-Colonel H.H.i'* Dickson, C.I.E., tieal Agent, it. the Americans and our special the foreign office xhe xndia office much as they can, but/2 ! ® 'but Sliaikh AJimad has definitely let us down badly and x think it is up to him to get us out of the mess, and put his foot down and to say definitely that he will not have Americans at any price. On the other hand the foreign office may say that this will look rather thin: that every one knows we are quite prepared to take up a strong line with the shaikh vhen it suits us and that the Americans will contend that we have dragged this letter out of the Shaikh. I persona&amp;ly am convinced that the Shaikh does not want Americans and if he let them in and. they struck oil he would very soon cease to be anything but the nominal ruler of Kuwait. However, we will see how they react in London to my suggestion and if you have any comments to offer 1 shall fce very glad to consider them.Telegram XX., No. 62^, dated 25th February 1932. From . .

Policy of His Majesty’s Government in Gulf region was authoritatively defined by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs speaking in House of Lords on 5th May 1903. Ex tract will be found in Lorimer’s Gazetteer Volume I Part I page 369. It will be noticed that even then suggestion that our efforts should be directed towards exclusion of legitimate trade of other Powers was emphatically repudia ted. If we attempt to define what constitutes legitimate trade we can find no more satisfactory criterion than that which is genuinely beneficial to interests of principalities in Gulf region. ceding on this line, although we must admit force of many/arguments and anticipations to which Biscoe has given expression in his telegram of 7th February No. 93, and are . under no illusion that if concession were granted it would prove unmixed blessing either for Koweit or for His Majesty’s. Government and ourselves, yet drawbacks which he pictures are likely to arise in matters incidental. Moreover some of them at least could be avoided by maintenance of good relations with foreign Government concerned. If attention is confined to essentials, we incline to opinion that, suoject to certain reservations, balance of advantage lies in admiss ion of American interests. For if project does not develop, no harm will have ensued. If it does, engagement o.f American capital on considerable scale in Gulf will make for stabil ity and world peace, which we regard as His Majesty’s Govern-'Clpromote local prosperity and development with v;hich doth they P nd we are especially concerned. We therefore agree to omission of British control clausa. 4 . We are addressing you further on various aspects of this ouestion hy mail, hut desire to take this opportunity of offering certain observations for your immediate consider ation and communication to Foreign Office, if you accept cur views. 5 In first place omission to have made proper provision at Bahrain for exclusion of foreigners has undoubtedly queered Koweit pitch and we are inclined to think that it was perhaps mistake of tactics to attempt to raise nationality bar question over Koweit agreement. In view of Shaikh's tortu ous attitude it is anyhow now no longer possible to pretend that objection comes from him and at present juncture we therefore advocate dropoing this line altogether. 6 . This however is by no means to be construed as acquiescence in imediate grant of concession in proposed form. Shaikh has not yet signed anything and is mder no obligation to give any concession at all to Extern General Syndicate, unless they are prepared to offer him term which are genuinely to his advantage. If can offer from A.P.O.C. .or any other quarter he is quite at liber ty to accept it. It might now, we suggest, be represents-- to American Ambassador that our chief concern 1- net with questions of nationality as to secure best terms possib] for Shaikh of Koweit and other Arab Eulers of Gulf whom we regard as our wards, and our opposition to admi foreign interests hitherto has been at least m part based on anticipation that they would prove less amenable to our guidance than British concerns.

The party will be followed shortly afterwards by one of our engineering staff, Mr. H. H.

We are informed by our London Principals that they have approached the Colonial Office with regard to an extension of the reconnaissance some distance to the South into the territory of Hasa, where it is believed that the older strata are in places exposed, and that they have requested the Colonial Office, if possible, to telegraph to Ibn Saud applying for the necessary permission and facilities.

I have passed on your news about Philby to whn i s now in the U.S.A. His book is just I am sending you herewith a Bertram Thomas, who out and very notable it is. presentation copy. As to our own affairs in Kuwait, it is not possible as yet^td^nake any deductions from the meagre information whibli we have of surface shows of bitumen, which mean nothing in particular, so far as the prosoects of commercial use are concerned or the sulphuretted hydrogen at Jebel Fawaris. We contemplate making an exploratory boring 500 ft. or so in depth at Bohara, in the hope that it may tell us something of what sort of rocks are to be found beneath the surface. This may enable us to make some sort of guess as to oil prospects, and help us to decide whether or not to apply for a concession. The Americans having put down a couple of bores in Kuwait, we are reasonably entitled to do as much ourselves, for though they were as ostensibly looking for water, there could have been no reasonable doubt in anybody*s mind that fresh water would not be found at Kuwait. Indeed, I had the wiiole question examined by Pilgrim of the Geological Survey of India and by Pascoe, if I remember right, in the War years, and their reports were entirely unfavourable for the possibility of fresh artesian w r ater, though they were sure that it would oe found at Bahrain, as has indeed happened. 8»-L L.IX Cl-L-L for your co-operation With all good wishes to you a iperation with our geologists. to you and many thank; 1 ^ n-T o Yours sincerely, Lt.-Col.

Mr Atherton stated his understanding that on that occasion Sir Lancelot Olipnant had replied that he had no information on the particular point but that Mr Atherton's representation would be brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities, with an idea of determining whether Mr Atherton's possibly undue apprehension was - in fact founded In the course of a subsequent con- -versation Sir Lancelot informed Mr Atherton that he under- -stood that the activities of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company had in fact increased during the month of December, since, in fact, the begining of the conversations between the Foreign Office and the American Embassy on the question of a Kuwait oil concession. Mr Atherton took occasion to explain to Sir Lancelot Oliphant on January 27th. that according to his then understand- -ing^a number, if not all of Anglo.Persian Oil representatives engaged in exploration work in Kuwait had in fact 'cleared out ' On February. 24th, after brief references to former cmver- -sations, Mr Atherton then informed Sir Lancelot Oliphant that he had recently been advised that geologist representing the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had recently returned to Kuwait and had this time brought with them drilling machinery and plant2 /l ths matter migtit Toe t)xouglit to ttie attention of* tlxe appro 'or 3 ate authorities, together with the fact that he could not hut feel from this latest information that his representation made on December 29th as set forth above was indeed founded. On February 26th Mr. Atherton called by appointment on Sir ^anc&amp;Lot Oliphant at the Foreign Office and under instruct- -ions stated that he desired to emphasise the opinion of his Government as to the correstness of the views that Mr Atherton had expressed to Sir Lancelot Oliphant on December 29th, as set forth above, and to urge that the activities of the Company in Kuwait be suspended pending the receipt of a reply to the representations first made through the American Embassy in London on December 4th and subsequently continued by Ambassa- -dcr Dawes and Mr Atherton. The American Charge D*Affaires /*- also on this occasion stressed to the Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the viewpoint of his Government as to the desirability that an early reply to the American repre- -sentations might be received without further cindue delay.

It may be too late to advocate the introduction in Kowelt# and elsewhere in the Persia® Gulf# of agreements following closely the lines of the draft prospecting licenses and mining leases given in the Indian Mining Rules* Bit we must realise that in agreeing to a concession in any particular terms now, we are in effect agreeing to the type of Mining Rules that should apply to iCowelt territory! and the absenoe of any such rules appears to necessitate that an agreement for the grant of mineral concessions in Kowelt territory should be self-contained with its own embodied mining rules# as in the case of Blisoat and Bahrain* As 2 have said above# I strongly reconmend scrapping the present draft agreement and the drafting of a new one following the general form of the Mu so at and Bahrain agreements with such additions as seem necessary to make them17# How with reference to the terms of the proposed concession agreement of which two forms are presented and of which it may he presumed that the Syndicate would prefer the second edition as it is of later date* The chief objections appear to me to he as follows i- (a) The use of the term ’conceded territories* appears to he open to the gravest objection, as the use of such a term would do mor^tban anything to create an Izaperium in ligperio * The form used in the earlier edition of the proposed agreement namely *Khweit territory* appears to me hardly less objectionable* Ho necessity for any such terms was discovered in the Muscat and Bahrain leases, where the term used is •leased area* in small letters, and it seems to me exceedingly undesirable to make use of any terminology, the mere existence of which would help to usurp and derogate from the authority of the Shaikh and give the impression locally that a new power has been crested? consequently if this form of lease is to be retained, ’conceded territory* should be replaced by ’leased area* in lower case throughout* (b) In clause 1,paragraph 3, the ri#it to select 640 sq# miles is granted, under what should be termed a mining lease* Whatever area be specified here, there should be an explicit statement that at the end of two years, the exclusive light to explore and search the territories of the Shaikh for natural gas, petroleum, etc* should cease outside this area, and that, in addition this agreement is not at any time to 'Operate to prevent prospecting by other persons for other minerals eif.ner within or without the leased area* (c) With respect to the area, I agree that it is excessive, and that a reduction could be induced by charging an appropriate rent* In our mining leases we provideprovide for rent charges for two purposes. Surface rent is charged only for land actually occupied for mining opera* tlons* huilding8» etc. and depends upon the looal rates of rent in force# and if rent is to he charged for the whole area of this concession# it should not he called surface rent# hut minimum dead rent? there would then seem to he no reason why the rate so charged should he lower than the rates given in Schedule 0 of our mining rules* from ahloh it will he seen that the minimum dead rent should he He* 1 per acre for the first 10 square miles# Hs • 2 per aore for the next 40 square miles* Hs* 5 per aore for the next 50 sq* miles and Rs* 10 per acre for the excess over 100 eq* miles* the footnote to the Schedule states that these minima are purposely fixed low* hut they are liable to he largely exceeded* according to the value of the deposit and degree of development of the country. It will he agreed that as this is completely undeveloped country* the minimum rates cited above should not he enhanced in the present case* Ihus on an area of 640 sq* miles the mininum dead rent would amount to Hs* 30*49#600# a sum which seems absurdly hi£h# and would nn/douht deter any oompany from attempting to acquire a concession over a completely unproved area* The meaning of this is# of ocurse# that prospecting and mining periods are mixed up in one lease* as a result of vdiicth a much greater area is being sought for inclusion in this concession than would he finally held on mining lease# if a period were provided for prospecting# during which a fee not exceeding one rupee and not less than one anna per acre would he leviable under our rules. A fee of two annas per acre would amount to Hs* 51*200 annually over 640 square miles* and might hs regarded as suitable if joined with a minimum royalty of Ha# 50*000 as recommended later* (d) Clause 1# para* 5* prescribes a period of 70 years for the concession* This would he in addition to the 2 yearsyears provided for exploration* I auggeet the reduction of this period to a figure conforming with our customs in India* namely a maximum period of 30 years with a clause permitting renewal for a further period not exceeding 30 years* with provision for a revision at the time of the renewal of the rate of royalty* On thia point 1 should mention that the HU scat and Bahrain agreements provide for revision of the royalty after 10 years* The omission of any such provision in the present lease appears indefensible* In addition* there should be provision for a prospecting period prior to the grant of this mining lease? m&amp; as we Jmow prospecting licenses for oil are apt to be extended for many years before mining leases are taken out* (*) Clause 2(c)« The rights granted to the leasee for water should not be such as to interfere with the possibility of other prospectors subsequently searching for oil or searching for other minerals at any time* There is no easier way to block the work of other people than to obtain control of water resources* (f) Clause 4* The Sh&amp;ifch retains the right to grant permission to others besides the con^aqy to iaport oil and * lay pipe lines for these purposes* It is most in$&gt;artant that this provision should be adhered to* (g) Clause 5 appears to me to be thoroughly objection* able* as its retention in this form would preclude the exercise of the right of proeaption for oil in time of war either by the Shaiidi of Kowelt or the British Cevernment* The rate of expert customs duty on oil exported should* of course* be levied not on the value of the oil at well-head as provided* but on the value of the oil and Its product© ae exported, especially if under clause 6 the company is to have the right to inqport free of customs duty* the machinery* plant and materials required to enable the value of the crude ^il to &gt;&lt; bebe enhanced by refining. On whether 1$ ie/eui table «ite I express no opinion* (h) Clause 7* It has already been suggested that surface rent should be charged over the whole area of the concession* X have suggested above that instead a minimum dead rent should be charged over the whole area and in addition surface rent where ground is actually occupied. (i) Clause 3 contains no provision for advice to the Shaildi concerning the terms of transfer* This clause should* I thinky provide that the British company or com panies to which the ,3a stem and General Syndicate Ltd* desire to transfer their rights should be approved by the Shaikh acting under the advice of the British Government* AS the term * Canadian* is included in ♦British*» I suggest that the words f or Canadian* should be deleted* (j) Clause 14* This contains no provision that on the abandonment of any excavation pit or any well by the company* such excavation pit or well shall be properly fenced or enclosed* (k} Clause 15* For the grant of such an enormous concession what amounts to a salaami of H»* 30*000 appears to be a completely inadequate sum* and unless the maximum area to be leased is gi|atl^ly reduced* I suggest that this figure should be enhanced to one lakh* In addition* a sum of Bs * 20*000 prescribed as an annual payment thereafter seems also completely inadequate* As this sum is subsequently to give way to royalty* it is evident that it represents a minimum royalty* that Is* a minimum dead rent* which at the rates prescribed in our Indian rules would be* for 640 sq* miles* Rs• 30*49*600 as we have seen above! If the final area to be retained were* however, limited to 100 sq* miles* the minimum dead rent would be reduced to Rs* 1*93*600* and if the concession were split up into separate blocks and each assessed for dead rent and royalty separately* then the total &amp; minimumzainiaauia dead rent would be much amiler. Hhua on 5 block® ot 20 ®q* mile® each, the minimum dead rent would be i&amp;« 19200 x 5 » Ss*96000* It seem® ImposBible, therefore, to roeoumend that this figure of Es* 20,000 should be en hanced to less than l lakh even with a leased area restrict ed to 100 »q. mile®* If,however, it were decided eventually to treat this conceeaion in a different way from that pre vailing in India and to exhct &amp; permanent dead rent to continue Irrespective of payment of royalty,then I should suggest 2 annas an acre permanent dead rent over the whole concession, a® suggested above in paragraph 17(c),and a minimum royalty of 50000 in addition. (1; Clause 16. It Is evident from this clause that the &amp;• 20000 which, I suggest, be increased to &amp;&gt;. 50000, 1® by ^ way of being a minimum royalty. (m) Clause 17. If the minimum royalty be left at Es.200Q0, until the company declares that it has found oil in commercially exploitable quantities, which may be assumed to be in the opinion of the company the quantity of oil that should produce Es. 70,000 as royalty at the rate prescribed, then as ks. 20,000 corresponds to 4714 tons and Es. 70,000 corresponds to 20,000 tuns, any quantity between these two figures in excess of 5714 ton® would escape paying royalty at all, until the company had declared its success in finding oil in commercially exploitable quantities. I may mention that the rate of royalty of is. 5/8/-per ton agrees with the royalty charged in India of anna® 8 per barrel on the basis of 7 x 40 » 280 gallons to the ton. All that is necessary is to amalgamate clauses 16 and 17 to the effect that the royalty is to be a t £s. 3/8/- par ton subject i to a minimum royalty of i&amp;. 50,000. In) Clause 19(b) contain® no provision for the deposit of iian. and inforaation wittakbe JbaUh on abandonment of the work. Also this clause would require radical modifi cationlaodlfleation if tue lease be remodelled to conform to the Indian leaee of 3o years with right of enhancement of rate of royalty on renewal for a further 30 years. io) Clause 21 does not suggest how the Chaiitn'e arbi trator is to oe eel acted. 1 suggest that it csiould provide that the Chaikh in such a case should receive expert advice and that his arbitrator should be approved of by the Poll- tical Agent at Koweit. i8. In addition to the pointe enumerated fcy me above as the result oi perusing tne leaee consecutively, there are others of which by far the most importatit is the right of pre-emption in time of war concerning which 1 strongly urge that a clause be inserted* 19* In addition, a comparison of this projected agree ment with our standard form of mining lease shows the following omissions;* There is no cl&amp;uee analogous to Part III, clause 4,of the standard form of mining lease; perhaps this can be omitted, Part IV, clauee 2* Liberty to make railways and roads is not reserved. Part VII, clause 2* There is no reference to the demarcation of boundaries* Tart VII, clause 6* There is no provision for inspec tion on behalf of the Shaikh* Part VII,clause 5* Ho provision exists for reporting accidents; there will be no expert body to whom such re ports could be made; nevertheless good government requires that the Shaikh should know what happens in his territory. i art VII,clause 8. There is no provision to report to the shaikh the discovery of other minerals. Partx X M X X &amp;;(§&gt; J/&amp; iart VII, clause 13. No provision for ment of coapensatioa' for injuries to third parties. Fart VI1,clause 14. Bo provision that the company shall mxt not obstruct the working of other minerals; this might prove a serious o mission ii other prospectors discovered other minerals in the area leased for oil* Partjvi 1, clause 18, whica is the British control clause ox Indian leaBes, is # bi course,missing,as also clause 20 of F a rt HI, granting right of pre-emption in time of war,and clause 9 of Fart IX granting power to take possession In event of war or emergencies. 20. Apart from the numerous specific defects In the &amp;&amp;ift agreement between the Eastern and Uener&amp;l Syndicate Ltd. and the dhaikh of &amp;oweit,my chief objection to this agreement is that it appears to be in a form that Vviii not work. there is no provision for an adequate prospecting period and this appears to be the real reason why it is necessary to provide for the selection of so large an area as 640 sq. miles, if this agreement were to be remodelled on the lines of the Muscat and Bahrain agreements so as to provide for an exploration period of 2 years with a possi bility of extension, and a prospecting period of 2 years also with the possibility of extension for the reasons given in the Muscat and Bahrain leases,we should be pro* viding the company with a longer period within which to selectjthe tracts they require to take up on mining lease and the total area to be granted could then be much smaller. In additionalth the provision of a longer period for exploration and prospecting, the period of the Mining Lease could be reduced from 70 to 60 years, split up into 2 periods of 30 years, as already 8Uggested,and if this is to be done, it will be seen that by far the simplest procedure, in view of all the objections, is to start with the saterlal of th© present Bahrain agreement and modify it so as to take account of tae various points brought out.25* IV* Ri^ht of ^re-eiaation Clause . I note that the Angloreia n 0 U Company are aga in in the field the mg el ve s be applicants for a xaocjciEjBxxi Qjcoe salon* This should be welcomed; but if eventually a portion of fCoweit is granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd*t in spite of their entanglement with an American Company, it will evidently prove impossible, in view of the Bahrain precedent, to include a British control paragraph* nevertheless, this should not preclude the addition of clauses providing the right of pre-emption and possession in case of war* I noticed somewhere on the file the suggestion that if the company were re gi g»te ye d as a British company, this would automatically render possible British control in case of war. Our previous experience in dealing with the Syndicate shows that anything not specifically included will be difficult to claim later and I suggest for consider**tion that though the Government is prepared to waive the Britisi control caluse, they should insist on the explicit inclusion in the concession of a clause providing right of pre-emption* V*Chief 2,opal •Representative* 26, If a concession for a portion of Koweit is eventually granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd*, and transfer is permitted to American interests on conditions similar to those arranged in the case of the Bahrain,leaae, providing for a shadowy x&amp;&amp; sort of British control with provision for a Chief Local Representative, I venture to suggest that Government should object to ;4ajor Frank Holmes being Chief Local Representative in Koweit as well as in Bahrain* It has already been suggested in these papers that it is impossible for him to carry out sa ti sfactorilyeatisfactorily his duties as Chief Local Representative at Bahrain if he spends a considerable portion of the year eleewhere, This provides sufficient reason for objecting to his holding the same poet in Koweit, and in the event of the Qovernnaent adopting this point of view f I suggest that provision should be made for a Chief Local Representative who is a persona grata to the Government, as in the case of the British Director of the Bahrein Petroleum Company.2 P.T.P.

No.65. j M »y l6th , l i l i . { 1 I aa enclosing in original a 'personal' letter which I recently received from Sir Arnold Wlleon, as you ought to be kept aware of every move In the 'oil game' which Is going on hero. 2# On receipt of* oil* Arnolds letter* X took upon iByself the responsibility of seeing the Sheikh and informing hi* verbally and in as tactful a manner as I could, of what the former had said in his para 2. I of course took special care to say that what I was communicating was entirely un official , and that I was only passing on a friendly message of Sir Arnold Wilson, made to me in a purely private capacity. I further added that I took no responsibility at all for what I had been asked to say. 3# The Sheikh as I expected he would rejected the proposal at once, saying that it would neither be fair on himself or on Holmes, were he to grant an exclusive option as proposed. He asked me to Inform Sir Arnold to this effect, and to say that he was prepared to consider, as he had always been ready to do, a formal application for an u oil concession” from the A.P.0.0, in the same way as Holmes was doing, but nothing more. The Company which offered the best terms would get the concession, always provided that approved the wording of the various clauses. 4. The Sheikh rather heatedly told me that he had been blamed on all sides by letter and otherwise (presumably by Holmes in particular) for having again allowed the A.P.0.0. Geologists into his country when smother Companys proposals were before him. He had however done so he said simply because H.M.G. had supported and blessed the A.P.O.Cs request. As the A.P.O.C. had been foolish enough to withdraw their men, he could mot see his way to let them in again in order to sink The Honble, Lieut-Colonel H.V.Biscoe Political Resident in the Persism Gulf.2. sink shafts and dig holes etc. etc. f and generally lay hare the possibilities of his country. They ought to come forward like Holmes eas doing, and make him a straight business offer, and chance ahether there was oil or noti This he said Holmes was at present doing, and in exchange for a concession was daily renewing his money offer, for a handsome sum of money down and much more to follow if oil were found. 5* obviously Holmes has been bringing heavy pressure to bear on tne Sheikh since he came back from Bahrain and I think has got him largely on his side now. 6. The oheixli greatly resented the sudden withdrawal of the geologists, for he had formed great hopes that as a result of their work the A.P.O.C. would come forward and firmly bid against Holmes 1 people. Holmes has not failed to seize the opportunity to atrenghan his position, and daily I believe points out that the A. P. 0.0. are only flirting with him, the Sheikh, whilst he,Holmes, had never deviated from his original offer to negociate an agreement, with financial benlfits to the state. 7* AS I have mentioned elsewhere, on Holmes 1 return here, the Bazaar was filled with rumours that the Eastern General Syndicate had brought an action in London against the A.P.0.0, and had won, hence the withdrawal of the geologists. The rumour must have originated from Holmes. 8. To sum up the local situation at present seems to be that while A.P.0.0. rt stock H has depreciated t&amp;rxifely heavily. Holmes* rt stock* 1 has gone up. 9. The A.P.0.0, are, rather late in the day, trying to rehab ilitate themselves with the Sheikh and Elkington is now arranging to send the Sheikh a searchlight for his yacht. He of course ought to have done this two years ago. 10. I have written to Sir Arnold Wilson and told him that the Sheikh did not at all 'jump' to the £2000/- idea. 11. In the meantime I am closely watching Holmes, who I feel sure at every opportunity suggests to the Sheikh that he ought to strike out a strong line for hlmsalf and cease leaning on and trying to please H.M.G-. or the Political Agent, especially in matters that concern the immediate financial prosperity of hfes state. IllTne Athenaeum Personal* ' . P all Mall S.W, 1 . 29th April, 1932. Mv dear Dickson, You will have been as dissapointed to receive as we were to send, a telegram a fortnight ago saying that we did not wish jat_Jjresent to negotiate for a concession in Kuwait, and that we were withdrawing our geologists. Bor tactical reasons which I need not detail, it was necessary to send this tele gram and to withdraw our geologists,■ who would in any case have oeen compelled by the heat to leave within the month. The Infor mation that we were getting was of a nature that would greatlv Interest any of our competitors and we were not disposed to make them a present of it. I do not mean you to deduce from this statement that the views that we formed regarding the prospects of comercial oil in Kuwait were hopeful., but( Unlike Major Frank Holmes) we have Interests in Persia and in Iraq through the I.P.C., and the physical world being what it is geological conditions existing below the surface in neighbouring countries an&lt; 3- YAb-g versa, , and we are at this monentKR. engaged in putting down a deep test in the hills south of Bushire, and our observat- ions at Kuwait have to be correlated with what we are getting in that well. Thus looking at Kuwait, not merely from the local point of view of a possible small oilfield but as part of the geological problem of the countries at the head of the Persian Gulf, we are,or are likely to be, interested in the matter £0 the extent of not wishing entirely to abandon further research into the possibilities of Kuwait, though these are of necessity very speculative• I have no idea as to whether Frank Holmes and his American backers are pushing the Sheikh hard, or whether he is disposed to grant them a. concession* If, however, you think fit, you might inform the Sheikh verbally that you have reason to think that this Company might be prepared to pay the Sheikh £ 2,000 sterling cash down in return for an exclusive option to prospect and survey Kuwait territory for the next two years, or if the Sheikh thinks this too long, for the next eighteen months, i*e., covering two cold weather* seasons. This would give time for us to complete our deep well tests on the other side of the Gulf and to correlate the information that we have or may obtain at Kuwait with the work that is being done both2 a / C- 'V fa 'both in Inacj. and in Pensia* X cio not- tninlv th.at the Company w would be prepared to go higher than £ 2 , 000 , nor to commit ourselves to any specific undertaking as to drilling, etc., and at the end of the period of this option, the Sheikh would, of course be perfectly free to take whatever action he thought fit elsewhwre. Will you drop me a line to let me know whether the Sheikh is disposed to consider favourably some such arrangement. If so , I would be prepared to recommend strongly to the Chairim that we should take action on these lines. I am only venturing to trouble you personally in the matter in view of our conversations last summer and of the fact that we have no representative at Kuwait whom we could entrust with the duty of making these preliminary enquiries. With all good wishes. Yours sincerely, A.T.Wilson.(signed) ' ! ’ I Lt.-Col, H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait, Persian Gulf.D.O. Ho.301-3 of 1932. British.

I presume communications to the Shaikh from you generally issue in Arabic: I do not, however, trust my present staff to make a proper translation of this letter. I am there fore sending it to you in English and should be glad if you would have it carefully translated into Arabic, and forward my letter to the Shaikh with the translation certified oy you to be correct. Please explain to him verball y- the reason for this procedure. It is unfortunate in a way that we have had to give up the nationality Clause, but the Shaikh’s unfortunate letter certainly put everyone in a very difficult position, and possibly when Holmes sees the modifications in the lease that we propose to insist on he will not think that his victory is quite as complete as he Sir Evelyn Howell is passing through Bushire by ^ V.~ —' ~ W • 4 .« Tio a Vi after dinner on the 19tn and go shall be going into Basrah aite.. amu* down to Mohammerah on the afternoon of the 20th. l.H.R.P.Dickson,C.

It presumably stops long enough to enable me to get ashore and have, say, an hou^s talk with the Shaikh. So you might inform him that I shall be arriving on the 21st or 22nd, and that if he would like to discuss this matter or any other matter with me I should be very glad to see him. Should the Shaikh discuss this question with you, please note the sentence in the Colonial Office telegram that '’His Majesty’s Government do not wish to should be careful to avoid any appearance of desire to influence his choice.” Also you will see that the conditions mentioned in the concluding portion of the telegram are for our informa tion only and should not be communicated to the Shaikh at present.R 30 Telegram Fr om To Ho 3.

You should explain to Sheikh that as regards application of Eastern &amp; General Syndicate His Majesty’s Government for their part c,c not insist upon confining concessior to a purely British concern anc that he is at liberty to dispense with this condition or not as he feels nest. His Majesty’s Government go not wish to influence him one way or the other on this point ana you should be i careful to avoid any appearance of desire to i nfuence his choice. You will see however that it has aeen mace clear to trie American Emoassy that His Majesty's Government ’ s decision does not imply agreement in immediate giant of proposed concession to Syndicate.

Followinglearning this, felt sorre acubt as to the correctness of tiiif- interpretat 1 ck of the sne ikh* s attitime, since the sheikh haa consistently expressed himself emphatically to trie lecal EntiSh athority as desirous of confining any oil concession to entirely British interests. in 1 oui letter of the 3Ctii fecs tt, o e t you were rood enoup-ii to transmit for my information a copy ana translation of a letter f rom the sheikh to j c r Hoimes , tne re ore- -sentat ive 01 tae Eastern ana General Syndicate, on which thenAmerican interests apparently cased tae information on this point given to your Government. His Majesty’s Government have cause d encu iry to oe rnaoe of the sheikh, v.ho replied that he was still averse from receiving in his principality a company other than an entirely British one ana that he dda-not consider himself as in any way ^ committed by his letter to Major Holmes to grant the I Eastern ana General Syndicate the concession which they seek. It will be observed from a reference to tne Sheikh's letter that its final sentence only expresses; a readiness to discuss the matter further witn Major Holmes af ter agreement has been reached between tae s ynd 1 cate a no H 1 s e s ty ’ s Govern me n t. 4. Waen examining tne necessity for tue con- -t inued insistence on the inclusion in an;&gt; cA+ con -cession in respect of Kuwait of a clause coni ining it to British interests, His Majesty's Government aave bee no one err,ec not only with t.,eii own interest £. ir. t..e matter , but also with their o't,y to . ec ne terms possible for the Sheikh of Kuwait, ana, in particu -lar, have hau regard to tne pcssibu. jtj, be less difficult for tne local Blit tea authoritjee to coiitxol the activities of a Burely Bi..ti-u conc^,. to reconcile them wi ,1th the Sheikh’s interests. On aO o on a bali.ce of all tiie conflicting congelation*. Hie Maifsty'r Ooverninent are, however, now prepared, for their part, not to insist in Une case that any concession met contain a clause confining it to British interests, if the Sheikh for his part is willing to grant a. concession without sue a a clause, o.

I Should add that the craft concession submit ten to the Colonial Office by the Syndicate would in ari y case need revision, beta ir respect of the provisos designee to safeguard the interests of Hie Maiefctys's Government ( clause 6} arc on many points affecting the interests of the Sheikh. 6 . Ir paragraphs 4 and o of your note oi the 2#in March you have referred to the operations now being carried out by the Angle-Persi an Oil Company in Kuwait anc reminded me of the requests mace to my department that this cpmpary Should not be permitted to proceed with its ope rat ions penning a decision by His. Maics£y o Government as to the exclusion of. all but British intcJs.-t^ I would explair that the Anglo-Pereian Oil Company maui- -festea an inteiest in Kuvat oil;, and, inceea mace a foimal application for a concession before the^a*,tej.n and General Syndicate haa ever appeared on .tae ..cene,&amp; &lt;± . tae scene, though, the negotiations were at tnat time not brought to a conclusion, chiefly oecause the terms cuggestea Vvtre not sat isf act cry. Several months before any representations were maae by General Dawes or your- -sell j. n t ne ma 1 1 , e i , t ne A ng 1 o-^P e rs i a n Oil Com pa ny maae a request for permisicn to earry out a geological survey in Kuwait with a view to dec ice whether to suomit an application for an oil concession. In oruer to ensure that any oil concession which the sheikh may grant snail embocy the best available terms, it is, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, desirable ana propei tnat any interested companies be given every opportunity in auvance 01 satis!ying themselves, whether or not tney wisa to suo- -mit an offer. His Majesty’s Government therefore raised no objection to tne giant by the Sheikh of the application of the Anglo-Per; ian Company. I ur.aerstano that their present activities in Kuwait are coni inea to such a geo- -logical survey. 7. The pos i tier therefore is. that His Majesty’s Government, for their part, are preparea to agree to the omission from any oil concession , which the b$.eixn mg' be preparec to giant , of a clause ccnirning it to British interests.-. li , the ref ore, the Eastern ana fteneral Sync lea te des ire to remew their appl ioation to t.r.e &amp;c=ika for a concession, yo ich they v:c’il&amp; n&gt; tsecuently tr-nei er to the Ear tern Oil Comps teHnty’* Govetmerit v/ill raise no objection to the application being taken into cons ice rat ion together '.vita any otner applications fca for oil concessions which may be i orthcoming irc.n otnex cuarters.

You will doubtless have advised Sir Arnold direct regarding this proposal. Mr.Elkington had in mind send ing a representative to Kowait to pursue the matter further with your advice and assistance and we proposed sending down Mr.A.H.T.Chisholm who at present is our representative and Manager at Ahwaz. If in the interim Gass returns from Baghdad it is possible that I might be sent instead of Chisholm or perhaps subsequent to his visit.

Yours sincerely, Lt.Col. H.R.P.Lickson, C.I.B., Political Agent, Kowait.Strictly Confidential. No. 69. My dear Myles, Thank you for your confidential No.72/c/7. Dated 17th May 1932. 2 . I received Sir Arnold Wilsons’s letter of 29th April all right, and I privately put forward his proposal to the Sheikh about an exclusive option to prospect and survey Kuwait territory. 3. The Sheikh did not jump to the proposal at all, and for t he present at any rate , the going is difficult. I have 1 written and told Sir Arnold all about this. 4 . The trouble of course i s the pre sehce in Kuwait of Holmes of the Eastern General Syndicate. Holmes'is in the very strong position of being able to offer the Sheikh generous money down for an immediate oil concession, and much more to follow if oil is found. He is quite positive that Kuwait is the center of or near an immense oil field, and he is never tired of rubbing it in to the Sheikh that he wants to make no examination or survey of his territory beyond what he has already seen and done, and is ready to risk heavy money for an immediate concession. Your people on the contrary are over cautious. 5. Hithertoo H.M.G.’s M British Nationality Clause ” has prevented Holmes concession going through, but the clever Holmes backed b;/' his American palls has forced us off this line and the Nationality Clause has now gone west. 6 &lt;&gt; It was a thousand pities 3 r ou had to withdraw your Geologists. The Sheikh had hoped their report would bring the A.P,O.C. right forward with an application for an oil concession proper- Their withdrawal hurt his amour - considerably, and his attitude new is,”no more survey, but a proper oil application such as Holmes is putting forward . 7, Biscoe arrives here tomorrow and will no doubt talk to the Sheikh. For the moment my advice is that you send no one to Kuwait, if it is only to put forward Sir Arnold’s proposals. My second advice is that your company do not le^ the grass grow under their feet any longer, but should go right ahead and apply for an oil Concession at once. I like Holmes am convinced there is oil here, and If your people dont m4ve Holmes and his Americans will cut you out. The Agency, Kuwait, Persian Gulf. 21 . 5. 32lersonal.

I only had a couple of hours on shore and the discussion was rather hurried, but served a useful purpose. jDiokson then showed me the letter he had received from Silson, and told me that the Shaikh was not prepared to accept this offer, and X must say X think ns is quite right. The dealings of the Angl©-Persian Oil Company with these Arab Principalities have in the past been un satisfactory. In his despatch Mo.l«/205-S of 28th March 1924 the Political Resident reported that they were un popular on the Arab ooaet and expressed the view that their principle object in seeking oonoesoione was to prevent other companies from coming in, but that this was not fair to the h'- iifha and that they ehould be given a specific time within which to carry on negotiations, failing which other •C.PprkinBon,Ssq*, CeM•'I * , 0 *B*k* , Colonial Office, £ &amp; E Si £ E*o one es si on hunters would be given a chance* As a result of this they were informed in Colonial Office letter Uo.22811/1924 of 27th May 1924 that their claim to priority would be recognised up to the 3lst March 1925 and though they subse quently applied for a further extension this was refused them, Tide Colonial Office letter Ho*29139/1924 of the 28th June 1924* Since that time they have done nothing in particular on the Arab coast till last August when they asked permission to send their geologists to Kuwait* Xhe Shaikh readily accorded all facilities and asked for no payment of any kind except out of pocket expenses for guards, etc. 'Hie geologists did some months’ axploration in Kuwait, but laat April were suddenly withdrawn, and I was informed by their General Manager out here that their Directors had decided that they did noc wish to take any steps to acquire a concession at present, and a letter in this sense was also written to the Shaikh. Holmes at once gave it out that they had withdrawn their people ae a result of pressure from his company. I do no^ suppose i. is true, but it goes down with the Arabs. Now we get Wilson’s letter in which again no request is mode for a concession, and the Shaikh not unnaturally regards it simply as an attempt to ride off Holmes and Company, and I think he it probably right. Anyhow a private letter from Wilson to Dickson hardly seems to me a particularly desirable manner of dealing with this question, or one which is calculated to inspire the Shaikh with confidence in the intention, of the company. On e one ton d we hare Holmes, who presents the Shaikh with neiderable cash presents, motor cars, wireless, etc. and finitely ask. for a concession and is obviously anmious to itain one. and, Judging from Bahrain, to exploit it when he Vl A I • • e3- ,/j r ' i / ( has got It, and on the other hand the Anglo-Peralan Oil Company, who hare for years past shilly-shallied and now first of all inform the Shaikh that they do not desire a concession and then in a rery informal manner say that they will give him £ 2,000 for an exclusive option to prospect and survey though no request is made for any formal concession* In these circumstances /it seems pretty obvious that they do not mean business but are merely anxious to ride off their rivals. I have thought it as well to let you know of this demarche and I am convinced that unless the Angl©-Persian Oil Company come forward formally with a definite request for a concession and some sort of indication that if granted they will exploit it I do not think there is the least ohance of the Shaikh agreeing to any proposals from them* As regards the Eastern and General Syndicate, the Shaikh said that on the one hand he did not wish to get into the bad books of His Majesty^ Government, but on the other hand he did want Money* Holmes, I understand, is preparing a revised draft concession and as soon as the Shaikh receives it he will send it to us to be vetted, and he assured me that any conditions that we put in he would certainly insist on, and he asked me to let him know definitely and clearly what we required.

I am to refer, in the first place, to the letter which the Sheikh of Koweit sent to Major Prank Holmes on the 2nd July, 1931, a copy of which was /* enclosed in your letter of the 4th August, 1931, and which you interpret to mean that the Sheikh is willing to omit the British control clause from any concession which he may be prepared to grant to your Company, provided that His Majesty 1 © Government are also willing to agree to its omission. Peeling some doubt as to the SECRETARY, 'HE EASTERN AHD GEKHJRAL SYNDICATE LIMITED.the correctness of this interpretation of the SheiM^s attitude, since the Sheikh had consistently expressed himself emphatically to the local British authority as desirous of confining any oil concession to entirely British interests, His Majesty's Government caused inquiry to be made of the Sheikh, who replied that he was still averse from receiving in his principality a company other than an entirely British one and that he did not consider himself as in any way committed by his letter to Major Holmes to grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate the concession which they seek. It will be observed from a reference to the Sheikh * s letter that its last sentence only expresses a r' re. tineas to discuss the matter further with Major Holmes after agreement has been reached between the Syndicate and His Majesty's Government. 3. his Majesty's Government have now considered the question in all its bearings a,nd have decided that, for their part, they will not insist in this case that any concession must contain a clause confining it to British interests # Whether the Sheikh for his part is willing to grant a concession without such a condition isis therefore now a matter entirely for the Sheikh's decision. It should, nevertheless, be made clear that this decision of His Majesty's Government does not imply agreement in the immediate grant of the concession to the Eastern and General Syndicate, to which the Sheikh, as stated above, considers himself in no way committed. His Majesty's Government indeed do not consider that they caul d properly advise the oheiich to give prior or preferential treatment to the Eastern and General Syndicate, but JiOh. i : to be necessary that any application for a concession which may be forthcoming from any quarter be examined with a view to deciding which, if any, will best serve the interests of the Sheikh and his principality. ' .h?.; &amp; 4. The draft concession which you have -already submitted would in any case need considerable revisioi, (a) in respect of the provisos designed to safeguard the interests of His Majesty’s Government which will need considerable amendment on several important points; and (b) in respect of many points affecting the interests of the Sheikh. 5. ■J- r~- 5 * If, therefore, the Eastern and General Syndicate desire to renew their application to the Sheikh for a concession, His Majesty^ Goyernment will raise no objection to the application being taken into consideration together with any other applications for oil concessions which may be forthcoming from other quarters.

I am much obliged for the action that you have taken and regret that it has not been rewarded with success. Elkington is dealing further with the matter on our behalf. The latest information that has reached us from Bahrain as to the progress of Holmes 1 well there is by no means favourable, and I have little doubt that it will shortly be abandoned. They have struck a little oil, rather less than 2,000 ft. below sea level, but there is not enough pressure to bring it to the surface and it appears to be heavy oil at that. This increases the prospects of unfavourable results at Kuwait, and makes us correspondingly the less inclined to leap into negotations without looking, but I need say no more as you will be in touch with Elkington. With renewed thanks and my kindestAla mail. M \ Confidential. D.O,So.346-S of 1932. The Haaiden^.

He began by referring to maon's letter and I told him my views regarding itf with which X found that he was in general agrees ment g and he told me frankly that their office out here had never thought that a proposal of that nature was in the least likely to be accepted by the Shaikh* X said that X thought the Shaikh was not unnaturally very dubious about their intentions and that it was essential if they wished to regain his confidence to come forward with e much more definite proposal* I then went on to say that I really saw no reason why the Angl©-Persian Oil Company should not come forward with a definite request for a concession on the lines of the Bahrain Concession* This would in the first instance not involve them in any considerable expenditure or commit them to anything definite* They oould ask for an exploration license for two years, during which they would only have to pay the Shaikh about £ 1000 a year and send some geologists round Kuwait, At the end of this period they could ask for a further extension as Holmws hrd done in Bahrain, and then they oould take out a prospecting license^which again would only involve putting up one rig - a ve-y smell matter for a comp an# like In© Angl©-Persian Oil Company.

Chisholm agreed with what I said, and is, I understand, reporting in this sense.

(No. 389.) Sir, Foreign Office, March 30, 1932. Mr. ATHERTON saw me this morning with reference to the transfer to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company of the oil concession which the Eastern and General Syndicate are seeking to obtain from the Sheikh of Koweit. General Dawes had mentioned this matter to me last December, and I had referred Avhat he had said to the Colonial Office. Air. Atherton indicated that the State Department were concerned at the lapse of time which had taken place without a reply from the British Government, especially as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, a rival concern, has been in the meantime conducting geological investigations in the area, and has been following these up by an expedition equipped with drilling machinery and plant. Mr. Atherton left with me a note which he had been instructed to deliver, and observed that inasmuch as a satisfactory arrangement had been made in reference to Bahrein, his Government considered that there ought to be no objection in the case of Koweit. I explained to him that my own absence at Geneva had -to some extent delayed the reaching of a conclusion on the matter, but that I had, since my return, been studying it afresh. Several Departments were interested in the question and I hoped to have the opportunity of bringing the matter before the Cabinet at its next meeting in a week’s time, after which I would communicate with him again. I am, Ac. JOHN SIMON. Enclosure in No. 1 Mr. Atherton to Sir John Simon. United States Embassy, London, March 29, 1932. ACTING under instructions, I have the honour to inform you that my Government recalls the enquire which it made through this Embassy m 1929 as to the policy of His Majesty's Government in the matter of the holding and operation of petroleum concessions by American nationals in British-protecte Arab territories such as Bahrein. His Alajesty s Government is aware o ic solution subsequently arrived at in the specific case of the Eastern enera Syndicate which, on behalf of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, was a ia ime seeking a modification of the so-called “ nationality clause, t e me usion o which in anv oil concessions granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein was oemg msis e upon by the Colonial Office. The arrangement then agreed upon had appeared to my Government only just in view of the extremely liberal treatment accorded n the United States and in its possessions in reference to the operation of petroleum concessions by British companies. My Government had therefore supposed that the policy of His Majesty’s Government would be no less liberal m the matter of according open-door rights to American nationals 111 , ow ® 1 • p . itself to be in the almost identical case of Bahrein. e ..rmlrl jm nr pci ate sincerely trusts that it has been correct m this assumption and would appreciate ' - g.***-. gw?- ment to require the companies seeking ^^'^^Njerfo'f such States to the ^ andTpeEns of such companies in the American Government is informed that contrary o JUs [408 gg—1] .—-—r^T'iir'wEE'k Y LE ENCLOSURE ^ 1932 -m,V P.UTIC&amp;L AKO ■ tGREtKRY, n p fiGE FR0 SeCBET BEPTMNO^ it2 have prevailed in the Colonial Office, the Sheikh of Koweit is understood to be quite agreeable to the specific entry of the Persian Gulf Oil Company and to the granting on behaif of that company of an oil concession without the inclusion of the “ nationality clause.” The American Government trusts that, in view of the apparent willingness of the sheikh in this matter, His Majesty’s Government will see its way clear to taking up, in the case of the Koweit concession, no less liberal an attitude than was assumed in the case of the Bahrein concession. The American Government understands that, despite the fact that the Colonial Office as early as 1925 gave its full and unqualified consent to the nego tiation by the Eastern and General Syndicate of an oil concession with the Sheikh of. Koweit, that office later qualified its consent by insisting upon the inclusion of the nationality clause in any agreement arrived at with the sheikh for the apparently specific purpose of preventing the entry into that territory of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, which had meanwhile arrived at an under standing with the syndicate as to the transfer of any concessions that it might -obtain from the sheikh. The continued insistence of the Colonial Office on this point and its apparent unwillingness to accord to that syndicate the same treatment as was accorded in the case of Bahrein has seriously handicapped the syndicate in bringing to a conclusion with the sheikh the negotiations which that concern was authorised by the Colonial Office to undertake. The above situation is further complicated by the fact that at the very moment while His Majesty's Government had under consideration the petition of the syndicate for the elimination or modification of the “ nationality clause,” permission was granted the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, a rival concern, to send a small party of geologists to Koweit for the purpose of studying the surface geology of the ground. It will be recalled that this Embassy on repeated occasions requested of the Foreign Office that the company in question should not be permitted to proceed with its operations, pending a decision by His Majesty’s Government on the question then before it regarding open-door rights for American nationals in Koweit. Now my Government has been informed that this study of the surface geology has been followed by a second expedition equipped with drilling machinery and plant. The Government of the United States greatly regrets that no effect has been given to this Embassy's request in this matter, but would appreciate being assured by His Majesty’s Government that this fact will not be allowed to militate against the position of the syndicate and its affiliate, the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, in the eventual granting of an oil concession in Koweit.

Il» Sir, X have the honour to Invite a reference to my despat eh Ho. 20 of the 7th June, with tv hi oh X forwarded a draft of the concession presented by Major Frank; Holmes to the Shaikh of Kuwait, and to submit herewith certain comments thereon. 2. this is the third concession that Major Holmes lias submitted to the Shaikh since 1 hare been here, the first was forwarded to you with my despatch Ho. 56 of the 17th September 1930. the second was sent with my demi-official letter Ho. 298-6 of the 2dih May 1931 to Sir John Shuckburgh as 1 was on tine point of leaving for Kngland. 5 ?he general conditions of these three concessions are similar, and 1 would invite attention to the suggestions put forward in my despatch Ho. 42, dated the 6 th October 1936* which with the exception of the reference to the nationality clause, apply equally to the present concession. 3. The chief distinction between the three con cessions is in the area bo be leased, in ilifc iirst concession no specific area is mentioned and the refer ence throughout is to Kuwait territory: in the second the area is 640 square miles divided into as many blocks as/ His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, London.&amp;a th« Company choose tfiile in the pxesenf oonceooion the area la no less than 1640 square miles. 4* Tlie previous concession van very severely criticised by the Director of the Geological Burwy of India from the technical point of vies. I vould venture to state that I entirely agree, from the political point of view, vith his view that the expression 'conceded territory' is open to the gravest objection, and with that expressed by the Government of India that anything suggesting an impsriuzn in iiaperio should be avoided, and that it should be definitely laid down in the agreement that the Company’s employes shall be subject to administrative and legal authority of the Shaikh to the j same extent as other foreigners resident in Kuwait f territory. 5 . flic area of 1640 square miles would certainly seem to be very excessive, but if the proposal made by _ the Director of the Geological Survey of India is accepted and a dead rent charged# it will presumably oe very considerably reduced. 6 . Doctor yemasor points out that clailoe 5 would preclude the exercise of pre-emption in time of war# •liter by the Shaikh of Kuwait or Hie British Government. As it is proposed to insist on this right of pre-emption —vide your telegram ho. 3# dated the 9th hey 1 presume this necessary amendment will be made. In para graph 26 of his note the Director of the Geological Survey of India has further suggested that His Majesty’s Government should object to Major Ifrank Holmes being Chief Local Representative in Kuwait as well as in Bahrain. I entirely agree with this view. The Company have apparently struck oil in Bahrain and it i» probable that they will in consequence in the near future consider ably extend their operations and increase the number of their employes. If eo. there will be many matters of detail arising for discussion between the Company and the Bahrain Government . &amp;nc it is essential a ^at thelocal Kesreoentative of tl* Com^^ B i louid ^ permanent ly located at Bahrain.

I would suggest tn&amp;t Xn view of the opinion expressed by the Director of the Geological Uurvey of India in paragrai&gt;h 15 of hit note an entirely freeh concesBion ehould be drafted enbodying those hf his Buggeetions which Hi® Majesty’s aovermaent consider desirabxd to incorporate and also tlie safeguards and that it nhould be die cussed with the Syndicate in London on the urn ere taming that it does not neoeoearily bind the Shaikh. 1 regard die cue si one out here as very unsatisfactory, as the Bhaikh is a child in the hand a of Major Holmes, \shile neither Colonel Dickson nor 1 possess any technical knowledge.

I retain very happy recollecticrs of my visit to Koweit and trust that I shall have the pleasure of renewing them and Your Excellency’s acquaintance in the near future. I have followed up my conversation on the subject of the pay- / ments made to Your Excellency’s account in respect of sand and shingle by further2 . enquiries to the Manager of the Ottoman Bank in Basrah.

I suggest that Your Excellency should therefore give this a trial and in the event of finding any cause for dissatisfaction, the alternative will be to keep the account in Dinars or to open a Rupee account in Bombay. In either event we shall be only too pleased to give Your Excellency any assistance you require. 1 am still prosecuting enquiries into the sand and shingle position and will shortly be in a position to write fully.

Your Excellency, We beg to refer to our conversa tion on the subject of lighters load ing sand and shingle within Your excellency’s territory and to inform you that the matter has br en closely ^ investigated in Abadan. We greatly regret it if there have been any cases of evasion of the obligations of the Hakhodas to take out manifests on payment of the specified fee. % careful search h- s been made of our records as the result of which we can assure Your Excellency thet the manifest numbers, the quantities dis- eherged from each lighter and the. Quantities given out to contract in the first place tally correctly, -e do admit however that the oossibility of evasion cannot be overlooked but we are confident that Your excellency can be satisfied that such cases are few and far between or our stocks of sariCi and shingle Cwhich are checked regularly) would at once show qu- ntities largely in excess of those we had con tracted for. Your Excellency will remember that immediately after the agreement aated 12th September 1927 was concluded between us, it was arranged that we Should, in bsdan, issue all manifests to Hakhodas loading sand or shingle against a Company contract ana collect the fee on Your Excellency’s behalf. This was later found to be impracti cable in some cases, as lighters emnloved by contractors are sometimes at -oweit or other seanorts and it would be much out of the way end add to their exnense if they were made to proceed first to Abadan to collect- 2 - &lt;&gt; J s* _ r\ o at&gt; t.h.eip manifests. In these cases there- f ore it was arranged that the manifest) should be issued and the manifest fees collected at Koweit and we on our side would insist on the production of the manifest before accepting delivery. The most specific instructions have been issued on this latter point and Your Excellency may rest assured that disciplinary action will at once be taken if any infringement of the regulation comes to our notice. To tighten up the procedure still further we have arranged henceforth to send to your Customs Authorities advance details of the contract when it is placed for sand or shingle from Tour Excellency's territory and to send regularly thereafter state ments showing, in tabulated form, the manifest numbers, the quantities delta -ed and the fees and taxes paid into Your ixcellency's account in Basrah. It is possible that the lighters seen and interrogated by Your Excel lency's control launch were loading shell which v/as not proviued for in the Agreement, but we intend hence forth to bring this commodity within the scope of the arrangement also. We have absolute proof that quantities of sand and shingle from Your Excellency's territory are being supplied under contract between Abdul Rahim and the Persian State Railways to Khor Muss; also that smaller quan tities are being supplied to Basrah under contract by Baoud Suleiman and Hasson S’assir. These three are well known contractors of ours and we venture to suggest th- t it is possible that the Rakhodas of the lighters, in ignorance or perhaps intentionally, affirmed incorrectly that they were loading for delivery to the Company. Ray we suggest that if any further- cases come to the notice of the control launch, they should be at once reported to us and the lighters detain -ed by Your Excellency until the matter has been fully investigated. In conclusion we should like to assure ¥our Excellency of our anxiety to see these contracts ruin smoothly and to the entire satisfaction of Your Excellency, We have the honour to be, Your excellency's most obedient servants, for ANGLO- PERSIAN OIL COMPANY Li ITED Sdj- A, Gass.

QUOTE My dear Colonel, Thank you very much for your letter No.lOO of the 29th June, it was of the greatest interest and assistance to receive the information contained therein. 1 confirmed after the plane had left that Major nolmes was aboard and I sent a telegram to my Principals to warn them of this development. i shall personally be very surprised if the Concession is negotiated in London, as 1 can scarcely imagine that such a course would be taken without offending the amour-propre of the Sheikh. This is however a matter of higher politics of which of course i am completely ignorant. You may be quite sure that we shall enter into this negotiation with no feeling of over-confidence. 1 realise that a thorny path lies ahead and' that only with perseverence and hard work can we hope to be successful. 1 have, however, a-great deal of confidence in my own mind in which direction the Sheikh's-best interests lie, and I hope that possessing faith regarding this, it may help to convince the Sheikh, in the long run, to the same opinion. 1 am quite sure that no time will be lost in prepaiing the draft concession and you can rely upon me to ensure that there is the minimum delay at this end before the document is transmit ted on to the Sheikh. 1 am so glad that you have sent a copy of your letter to Sir Hugh Biscoe, to whom I also wrote at length to exolain the - oresent nosition and have received his reply. 1 keeo him fully au' fait with any developments there may be bejore his departure.

My dear Colonel, I was greatly distressed to hear the news of Sir Hugh Biscoe’s sudden death. It was indeed a great tragedy and I hope you will oemit me to express to you my deepest condolences on the loss of such a \&amp;Lued colleague. I knew that he had been in a precarious state of health and 1 have little doubt that his death was due to the fact that he would never spare himself but insisted on subordinating his personal interests to those of the Country, which has indeed sustained a great loss. I had been in frequent correspondence .with him during the past month and 1 shall miss greatly helpful cooperation in connection with the Koweit developments which we have in mind and on which I had come greatly to rely. This letter will be handed to you by Mr.(Haji) A.F.Williamson who is now in Koweit for the purpose of leasing a suitable house and 1 shall be more than grateful if you will give him any assistance he may need in this matter. p- For your personal information,I should add that i have now in my hands an advance draft of the Concession we shall present to M.F. but there are still a^number of points to be rounded off before it is in its final form. I feel pretty confident, however, that it will not be long now before we are in the field. With kindest ut-Col. H.B.P.Dickson, C.

Thanks very much for your letter of the 1st August. I am asking Capt. Denison if he will very kindly deliver this to you as he happens, very conveniently for me, to be moing to Koweit tomorrow. I can quite appreciate what a terrible shock ir Hugh Biscoe’s death must have been to you, the more so as you were with him at the end and it was so sudden and unexpected. I congratulate you most heartily on completing the Sharjah Agreement; it must indeed have been a difficult task and is a fine achieve ment. I have sent Haji Williamson back to Koweit to complete the lease of the house which we are taking; many thanks for your advice about it, it sounds very suitable. The draft concession is being finally touched up and Chisholm will proceed to Koweit on or about the to present it to the Sheikh, with of course a copy to you and I shall send a copy direct to Bushire. It is an admirable document and I a 1 ^ sure you will be very satisfied with it. The wording is very simple and practical ly all the complicated legal phraseology which is apt.to appear in such documents in the form of padding, has been omitted. The terms we are offering are generous; I an.leaving them.blank in the very first place as I wish to ascertain if the Sneikh would prefer them to appear in Sterling or Rupees. It makes no differ ence to us and it occurs to me that sterling mi^ht be attractive to the Sheikh. It is such a well-established basis of Currency obligations in this part o^ the world and it rather tends to lift the document into the same sphere as the other concessions v/hich have been granted in Iraq and Persia. I intend.to follow Chisholm to Koweit a few days later and will then fill in these2 Q_ t? terms after the Sheikh has decided this point. Chisholm will of course, in the meantime communicate them to you. 7ith kindest regards Yours sincerely, Lieut-Col.
