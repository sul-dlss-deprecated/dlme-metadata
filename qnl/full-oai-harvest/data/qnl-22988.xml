Stannus reports that the strength of the Wahabee [Wahhabi] tribe has been entirely exhausted, following its unsuccessful efforts against the Turkish power. He suggests that as a result it will no longer be necessary to appoint someone to reside at Katiffe [Al-Qaṭīf]. Stannus states that his correspondence with the Arab chieftains has been constant and satisfactory. He discusses his recent correspondence with Sultan Bin Suggur [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī, ruler of Ra's al-Khaymah and Sharjah], particularly regarding the subject of two piratical boats from Sharga [Sharjah], which have reportedly been met on the coast of Africa by a British frigate, where its plundered property was confiscated and returned to its owners. In addition, Stannus relays information on the recent movements of Rahma bin Jauber [Rahma bin Jabir] and expresses his concerns that the reduced scale of the marine establishment could weaken British authority in the Gulf. Included with this letter are the following enclosures, primarily concerning the aforementioned boats from Sharga, which reportedly committed an act of piracy to the south of Muscat:Enclosure no. 1: a translation of a letter, dated 19 May 1824, from Sooltan Bin Suggur [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī, ruler of Ra's al-Khaymah and Sharjah] to Ephraim Gerrish Stannus, Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire;Enclosure no. 2: a copy of a letter, dated 9 June 1824, from Ephraim Gerrish Stannus, Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to Soultan Bin Sugger [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī];Enclosure no. 3: a copy of a letter, dated 9 June 1824, addressed to Goalab, the Native Agent at Muscat, by Ephraim Gerrish Stannus, which includes its own enclosure: enclosure no. 4, an extract of a letter, dated 9 June 1824, from Stannus to Shaikh Syed Mahomed been Syed Sallum, Governor of Muscat;Enclosure no. 5: a translation of an extract from a letter (not dated) from Shaik Kulfan of Asseloo [Bandar-e `Asaluyeh] to Ephraim Gerrish Stannus, on the subject of Soultan Bin Sugger;Enclosure no. 6: a translation of an extract from a letter (not dated) from Soultan Bin Sugger to Ephraim Gerrish Stannus;Enclosure no. 7: an extract from a letter (not dated) from Ephraim Gerrish Stannus to Shaikh Khalfaun of Asseloo, responding to the latter's concerns about Soultan Bin Sugger.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054395.0x000069#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
