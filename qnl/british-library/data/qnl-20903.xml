' |Q Political Agency, Bahrain,4th April 1909. i^rom Major P. B. Prideaiix, Political A^ent, Bahrain. h T o The Political Residenb in the Persian Gull', B u s h i r e« Sir, e I have the honour to report that the iur.-.ish officials in Ilasa,under their present Mutawrrif Mahir Pashc^ are apparently making some effort to establish their autho rity more securely in the rather vaguely deiined district over which they rule. During the last week of l^ehruar^ 1909, T 16o&gt;rd that the Mudir of Ojalr had beep oorrespoijlin j vnth the Dowasir tribesmen who periodically visit Zakhnuniya Island from Bahrain,with a view to getting them to admit their a,ll®:jiance to the Turkish throne.A week or two later the rumour reached Bahrain that a Turkish salaried Kiiranakam had been despatched to Poha to take over the Governmeno of the town (or whole Katar Peninsula, perhaps,as the Tixrks claim it) from Shaikh Jasim bin Thani and his deputy s n, Abdallah bin Jasim. On the 3th March I proceeded to Lusail,Shaikh Jasim' s headquarters, in the Agency Launched on the 10tn the old Chief rode in from the interior to meet me. I also despatched a Confidential reporter,who had accompanied'mo from Bahrain, by name Yusuf bin Ahmad Kajio, overland to r-oVa to collect all the authentic news possible connected wit- the object of iny vioit. Shaikh Jasim received me very cordially,ap- ^ ' J ' ever , . peared » be 1JS-. v: before. lie scoffed at; 'bhe not;ion 'that; there had been any recent ill-feeling between the Turks 3Jid himself^ ana dec lared that in the matter of the A1 bu Ainain disaifection a,t Wakra the Government had supported him quite as muc i as he could wish •The ftew official who had come to the foi't a Bida* was,he said,connected with the troops,and though he had tried occasionally to ; 5ive advice to Shaikh Abdaila^ (Jasim* s son),the latter had resolutely ignored him.When I observed that I had heard that the Turks were talking of assuming the Administration of the Customs,Shaikh Jasim said the revenue from this source was insignificant,bei^g only a,bout Es:400/-monthly,and barely sufficient to the cost of the Bazar watchmen.To please the British rT;.ve:r.-&gt; c.f.PersiaJi Gulf Residency Piary) ment he had introduced a Entry ITo.1340 for week ending + „ + ^11 +h* 7th July 19 07. ^ I ^eavy tax to kill the ^ trade in slaves and arms,but provisions and other necessit ies were still admitted free.The latter part of this state ment I am quite sure is not true, though the Shaikh went to the length of calling in my pilot,a Katar ilahkoda,to con firm what he said,and the mm actually did so until we had left the Shaikh's presence IMy messenger m Poha reported on his return that the Turkish official about whom we had been uneasy was ostensibly a Kazi,suoh as was attached to the Government Staff in Hofuf and Katif, and that his post, m Doha would be quite ^'sinecure as jio Arabs would eve^ go nee^' him.

Letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office dated the 26th May 1909 (Received under Foreign Department endorsement No.1642-E.A., dated the 15th October 1909). A( Copy ) • iJ&gt; India Office, 26th Myy 1909 Sir, I am diractad by Visoount Morley to encloae a copy of a tolsgram from the Viceroy aa to the action of the local Turkish authorities at Ojair in occupying the Is land of Zakhnuniyah, which is clairaed by the Sheikh of fa Bahrein. It will be observed that copies of correspond- A. ence are being sent by mail. An extract from the Persian Gulf Gazetteer giving the available information as to the island is enclosed| together with extracts relating to the Dowasir tribe. Lord Morley recognises the objections, in the pre sent phase of the political situation in Turkey, to ma- king representations of a controversial nature to the Ottoman Government. But the Turkish occupation of the island raises both the question of our protectorate over Bahrein and of the limits of Turkish jurisdiction on tho Katr Coast. In view of the consequences that may follow on any acquiescence on our part in Turkish encroachments Lord Morley see^s no alternative to at once addressing the Porte on the subject. As regards the form of the representations to be made Lord Morley would suggest for Sir E. Grey's consi deration7 (3 LA sideration that the question of our protectorate over Bsilirein should not be raised in the first instance, but jr that the warning against any disturbance of the status quo in these regions, which was addressed to the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1903, in connection with the reported appointment of Mudirs at Zobara, Wakra and Odeid, should be repeated with an expression of the hope that instructions will be sent to the Mudir of Ojair to revert to the status quo ante and withdraw from the island. As regards the tiovernment of India's suggestion that the Sheikh of Bahrein should be authorised to fly his own flag on the island. Lord Morley is of opinion that it would be desirable to await the result of any represent ations that may be made to the Ottoman Government before deciding on any line of action. It might, if necessary, be indicated to the Turkish Government that, in the event of the status quo ante not being restored, the question of examining more carefully and, if necessary, supporting the Sheikh's rights over the island will come under our consideration.

Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to the corres- Dondence ending with my telegram i 0.1077, dated the fMth ins tant on the subject of the occupation of Zakhnunieh Island by the Turks. n. In this connection I bep to forward r or the information of the Government of India a cony of a letter from the Poli tical Afent, Bahrein, or the subject. It would appear that No.745, dated 20th November 1909 5 the assurances given by the Turkish Ccverrment regarding the evacuation o^ the Island are correct and that there are no Turkish soldiers now there. 3. It will be seen that the Sheikh of Iahrein suggests that his flag should be flown at Zakhnunieh in the cold weather when the De/wasir tribe are there, but that no flag shoull be flown during the summer months when the island is uninhabited. On the other hand Captain Mackenzie thinks that, as no flag has been flown on the island since the days of the Sheikh's father it will be rather a disturbance of the status quo to fly a flag and the action will increase the suspicion with which our actions on the Arab Coast are viewed by the Turks. 4. It seems to me that if a flag is to be hoisted at all it shoul I be flown at intervals all the year round and not only for a few rronths in the year. I therefore propose, should thethe Government of India nee no objection, to request the his Sheikh to hoist flag and maintain a Da/wasir custodian who will remain on the Island during the hot weather, I have the honour to be.

Trevor , I.A., First Assistant Resident, in charge of Residency, Persian Gulf. With reference to this office diary entry No. 122, dated the 30th April 1909, I have the honour to inform you that some days after Major Prideaux left Zakh nuniya, four Turkish soldiers were sent to reside in the fort there and guard it. They stayed a few days and built a small house, and repaired the platform of the flagstaff, and then returned to Ojair, taking the flagstaff with them. About three weeks ago some fifteen men of the Dawasir tribe went to Zakhnuniya and it is reported that the Island is clear of soldiers. As the Island is uninhabited during the summer months, it is difficult to obtain reliable information as to whether the Turks visited the island from time to time, but it is reported by the Dawasir that there were a few soldiers th ere when they first arrived but that they left shortly after. They also stated that they have been told by the soldiers of the Ojair garrison that it is the intention of the Turkish officials to send over men shortly to repair the fort which is now a ruin. It seems probable that these actions are due to the changes of Mutasarrifs of Hasa, and of Walls of Busrah. ' I have warned the head of the tribe not to permit any imbroglio with the Turks. 2. I mentioned to Shaikh Esa the question of flying his flag in the island. He said that he would like it flown while the Dawasir remained there during the win ter, but that it should be withdrawn in summer on their return. 3. My personal opinion on the flag question is that if we are going to adhere to the status quo ante, the flag should not be flown as Sheikh Esa told me he did not think that the flag had been flown since the time of his father. Provided the Turks are not allowed to go there, and the Dawasir continue to go every winter the pre scriptive right to the island is strengthened without the question of the flag being raised Again if any insult to the flag takes place it may force our hand into severe measures than it may be politic to take. The hoisting of the flag there would moreover tend to increase the suspicion and distrust with which our actions in these parts are viewed by the Turks. S. G. P. I.—No. 2383 F. D.— 28-12.09—40—P, J.

The Vali replied that he had not at present received any telegram on this subject; that the island belonged to Turkey and that this Consulate had no right to enquire into their affairs either offi cially or privately. His Excellency then told my dragoman that he was astonished that the Consul, whoso business it was to watch trade, should interfere in political matters. My dragoman asked him to explain more precisely what he meant but he dropped the subject and on being informed that most of the people who fished in the island were foreigners and that the enquiry on ay part was Justitia:la.

With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 733, dated the 16th July 1910,1 have the honour to forward, for the information of „ _ f j i j iu o« j t i nmn the Government of India, a copy of a Ko. 613, dated the 23rd Jnly 1910. p .1 • - i e iv. t» T x» 1 further report received from the Political Agen^, Bahrain, in which he reports that two of the Turkish soldiers on Zakh luniyah Island deserted their post on 18th July and the other two have been recalled. 2. It is clear however from Captain Mackenzie's letter that the withdrawal of the men is only a temporary measure due to the heat and not to any change of intentions on the part of Saad Beg or the receipt by him of fresh instructions. In the circumstances I have not thought it necessary to communicate the purport of the report by telegraph. Enclosure, Copy of a letter No. 513, dated 23rd July 1910, from Captain O. IP* Mackenzie, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, to Lieutenant- Culonel P. Z. Cox, O.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Q-ulf, Bashire. With reference to my letter No. 429, dated the 17th June 1910, I l ave the honour to inform you that two soldiers of the Zakhnuniyah garrison ran away about the 18th instant, and the ether two were recalled by the Mudir of Ojair. The reasons for the flight are loneliness, bad water and indifferent provisions. I had originally not anticipated that the Turks would attempt to keep men in the island during the summer, but apparently the Mutasarrif of Hasa (Saad Beg) had given orders that it was not to be left empty. I will keep you informed of future movements in this respect.No. 2971, dated Bushire, the 6th (received 15th) November 1910 (Confidential). From Lteutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C .S.I., C.LE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To-The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 2963, dated 5th November 1910,1 h ive the honour to forward, for the information of (1) No. 720, dated 29th October 1910. the Government of India, copies of two (2) No 722, dated 29tl. Ortober 1910. letters received from the Political Agent, Bahrain, regarding the revival of the Mudirates of Odaid, Zuharah and Wakra and the location of a Turkish detachment on Zakhnuniyah Island. 2. It must be borne in mind that owing to the length of the time required for collecting and transmitting news, the Political Agent's reports on these subjects may conceivably have become incorrect by the time they reach Bushire. Enclosure 1. No. 720, dated Bahrain, the 29th October 1910. From— Captain C. F. Mackenzie , Political Agent, Bahrain, To-Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S .I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to correspondence ending with your endorsement No. 2974, dated the 19th October 1910, and more especially to your telegram No. 914, dated the 30th September 1910, to Mr. Crow, Basrah, 1 have the honour to state from reliable information that no Mudirs have taken up their appoint ment either at Odaid or Wakra. My present information is that there are Mudirs of Odaid and Zubarah residing in Hofuf (Hasa), while with regard to Wakra there is the office of Mudirate without a Mudir, although it is admittedly quite possible that some one may have recently taken up that post without the information reaching me. I hope to be in a position to give definite information as to the names and salaries of these Mudirs within a fortnight. Enclosure 2. No. 722, dated Bahrain, the 29th October 1910 (Confidential). From—C aptain C. F. Mackenzie , Political Agent, Bahrain, To— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S .I., C .I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to your endorsement No. 2599, dated the 27th September 1910, I have the honour to report that Zakhnuniyah is at present free from Turkish soldiers. The contingent of five whose arrival in Zakhnuniyah was reported in my letter No. 602, dated 26th August 1910, left shortly afterwards and two of them visited Bahrain at a later date and stated that they had deserted Zakhnuniyah on account of their fear of Bedouin. They have not yet been replaced but it is anticipated that a new consign ment will be sent as soon as the Dowasir from Bahrain go there to take up their winter quarters, viz., in about 10 days' time. 2. Should the Dowasir or Shaikh Esa enquire from me whether I approve of their going as usual I propose to reply in the affirmative, and add a few words warning them against getting mixed up in any imbroglio with the Turks.
