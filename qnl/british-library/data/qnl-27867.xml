Dear Harrison, © 1- Clinton Thomas has referred to me your letter of the 10th February about the proposal to route confidential correspondence between the Political Resident and the Embassy at Tehran via London. This is to let you know that we should have no objection to this proposal. I ought to mention, however, that it is assumed that the reference to 'air mail' in the first paragraph of your letter and in the second paragraph of the letter No.D.0.251-S of the 28th January from the Residency is intended to read 'air bag' since confidential material cannot, of course, be sent by ordinary air mail. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Embassy at Tehran. Yours sincerely. (E.A.G. Taylor) T. A. K.

We learnt about the closing of the Iraa-Kuwait your Office and from the Kuwait Oil Co. on the on the follov/-inc day; with the agreement of the Ministry o.

This arrangement should be better than sending the mails 3U ^ e v 1 Political Resident because I understand the Company has no 1 f a l interests in Bahrain and does net run a Polt Bahrain and Kuwait. Indeed it would be n ? A ) bv Office to send its mails for the United Kingdom fend ti.e by the direct flights to London, and I understand tnat the Comp ny will suggest this course to them. Surface letter mails for Kuwait are sent overland from Palestine via Basra, taking on an average, 24 days from the Uni vinffdrm tn Kuv/ait. These could be sent by direct snip or via MT ^ith adverse effects on the transmission time and we are reluctant to make any change without further infonna ion. /Could P.I.

Now that the headquarters of the Residency is at Bahrain there is no longer any necessity for this system and I would suggest that if you see no objection it should be discontinued and that instead sufficient spare copies of all communications should be sent to me to pass on to the Agencies which may be interested in them If for any reason it is desired to send any 4. covers direct to one of the Political Agencies I suggest that they should be put into my bag and I will then forward them. 5 .

Perhaps you will be prepared to write to Sir Geoffrey Prior on the lines of the attached draft. U (|(VBRArT LETTER Sir Geoffrey Prior^K.C.I.L., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. JiMi, (§?) 6530 Dear Prior, f DEC t943 You will remember I wrote to you on the 14th December last year about delays in the receipt of Auscat Intelligence Summaries, and that you replied in your telegram 4fc. ^3 of 1st March emphasizing the difficulties arising through dislocation of communications in the Gulf. I have since had enquiries made into the question of the receipt of despatches, sunniaries etc., from the Persian Gulf area, and you will see from the lists enclosed exactly how long these have been taking to • j reach Lonuon. The effect of this is of course that all correspondence of any importance or 1 urgency has to be conducted by telegram and that, generally speaking, air mail can only be used to convey detailedand supplementaiy information on questions under consideration. We have, therefore, had a preliminary . word with the Air Ministry to see whether they had ary suggestions to offer for improving the situation. The proposal has been put forward that a possible solution would be for the various Political Agents to send their air mail by R.A.F. plane,if opportunities are available,to Bahrein, A bag would then be made up at Bahrein and handed to the officer comnanding the R.A.F. Staging Post^ there marked 'for onward transmission to Cairo by 216 ^roup service', it would then be flown to Cairo under R.A.P. arrangements and there transferred to the R.A.F. Transport Command Service to this country. The Air Ministry say that there are frequent services from Bahrein to Cairo, and more or less daily runs from there home. The success of this system is likely to be1 dependent on the extent to which the R.A.P. are ahle to fly mail from the various Political Agencies to Bahrein, and the Air l.iinistiy are not certain to what extent this will he possible. They say, however, that the Bahrein Staging Post would be able to advise on this, and suggest that it will be best for R.A.P. Headquarters, Midale JSast, to communicate with them on the subject if it is considered desirable to proceed with the proposal as a whole, though suggest that in order to initiate such arrangements it would be best for us here to get into touch direct with the Priorities Board^Headquarters, R.A.P*, Middle Bast, informing them of the approximate j frequency, and weight pf the, bags, and asking them to fix up details with the R.A.P. Staging Post at Bahrein. R.A.P. Headquarters, Middle East, could then let us know when the system is ready to operate as a whole. I should be glad to have your comments We are, of course. on these suggestionsi to a considerable extent,in the dark as to the actual local conditions, but the Air Ministry appear most helpful in the matter, and there would seem to be great advantages if something of the sort could be got into operation* Bushire, of course, presents a slightly different problem, and here it may be best for you to continue sending mail by safe hand to Basrah jp^rt for onward transmission^ as I gather is the present practice. The question of transmission of mails from this country to the Persian Gulf also arises. Provided that a reasonably frequent distribution from Bahrein to the various Agencies by R.A.P. plane can be arranged it might be best for us to send all our papers (except perhaps for Bushire) direct to Bahrein, and have them distributed from there. At present I gather that what happens is that1 DRAbT LuiiTTilR S.V7. Warran, iSsq, , Air I&lt;linistiy.

V i — Many thanks fdr your note of yesterday giving details of despatches during recent months from your posts in the Persian Gulf area. Some of the transmission times are, as you say, very long indeed and it should certainly be possible to make better arrangements for the future. I have discussed the question with those concerned - here and my suggestion is that your various Resident s be instructed to despatch their mail to Bahrein by safe hand. A bag should be made up at Bahrein and handed to the Officer Commanding the R.A.P. Staging Post there, marked 'for onward transmission to Cairo by 216 Group service' • It will then be flown to Cairo under R.A.P. arrangements and there transferred to the R.A.F. Transport Command service to this country. There are frequent services from Bahrein to Cairo and more or less daily runs from there home. In order to initiate these arrangements I suggest that you get into touch direct with the priorities Board, H.Q. , R.A.P. Middle East informing the Board of the approximate frequency and weights of the bags and asking them to fix up details with the R.A.P. Staging post at Bahrein. R.A.P. ,H.Q. Middle East can let you know when the system is ready to operate and you can then advise your Residents. We are not too sure here to what extent the R.A.P. might be able to fly the mail from each Resident to Bahrein, but the Bahrein Staging Post will be able to advise on this if you will get H.Q.,I.i.E,, to ask them. If you know at once. should run into any snag, I hope you will let me Yours sincerely. t P.A.K.
