E 710/160/65 of the 12th February we enclose herein a copy of a despatch which was sent to the Government of India last December on the subject of the visit to Iraq of Maulvi Mohammad Bashir. We did not then send the Foreign Orfice a copy as we did not know that the Maulvi’s report would be passed to you. We take this opportunity to point out that it is more difficult to report on a visit by one of* these divines than it is to report on a tour made by a personage such as the Nawab of Bahawalpur. The divines eschew all contact with the ] Embassy and insist that any suspicion of their having ! come to work on behalf of His Majesty’s Government is i ; fatal to their usefulness; they work furtively and in dark places. The Nawab of Bahawalpur however openly declared that his desire and purpose was to do all he could directly to help the British war effort. In these circumstances we have to rely much on hearsay for knowledge of what the divines do whereas the comings and goings of the Rajahs and Nawabs can be seen by all. Yours ever, CHANCERY. EASTERN DEPARTMENT, FOREIGN OFFICE.(217/82/41). British Embassy, Bagdad. 27th December, 1941. My Lord Marquis, With reference to the despatch of the Secretary to the Government of India in the External ^ Affairs Department Do.F.32-N(p)/41 of the 29th August, I have the honour to offer the following observations on Maulvi Mohammed Bashir’s report on his visit to Iraq. 2. The Maulvi’s work was, so far as could be judged from the Embassy, good. He is a clever and 1 fluent talker and made the most of his talent. I am informed however that his personal character was not pleasing. he seemed to be grasping and malicious and much given to back-biting. These defects are reflected in his report, much of which is devoted to animadversions on individuals with whom he came into contact in this country. 3. Your Lordship is no doubt well aware of the ceaseless currents of intrigue which swirl through the fetid alleys of the holy Cities and will not wish me to discuss in detail the eddies which find their place in the Maulvi’s report. It will suffice for me to remark that enquiry neither confirmed tne charges which he makes against certain persons associated with the distribution of the Oudh Bequest nor substantiated his criticism of the Indian Vice-Consul, Khan Sahib Tahir Hussein Quereishi. 4. His proposals regarding further work in Iraq and, in particular, concerning the Oudh Bequest do not appear to me to deserve serious consideration. The statement that Arabs are fond of Indians and hate His Excellency Tne Governor-General of India, External Affairs Department, Government of India, NEW DELHI. the/the people of the Hijaz inspires no confidence in his judgment and his suggestion that Kashif al Ghata should take over the Oudh Bequest reveals a strange ignorance both of this man’s personal reputation and of the several 'fatwas' which he has issued attacking Kis Majesty’s Government. 5 . I am not acquainted with the scale on which the Government of India is accustomed to reward such service as the Maulvi .rendered by his visit to Iraq but the recompense claimed in riis letter to Major Shah appears to me to be out of all proportion to its intrinsic value. I should judge that he has been well enough rewarded by the payments he received before coming to Iraq and by the additional sums given to him here, though some, small extra gratuity may be justified on account of the hardships which he suffered during his internment in May.

His Highness the Nawaib of Bahawalpur visited Iraq at the instance of the Government of India for the purpose of putting the attitude of the Indian Muslims to the war to important Iraqi political circles. The Government of India described him as ’’one of the leading Muslim rulers in India. His loyalty is beyond dispute and he is not without perspicacity and experience of affairs” (P.Z. 1147/41) • He visited Iraq in April but owing to tlie outbreak of trouble left for India at the beginning of May ? but returned to Iraq from August to October (Ext.5105/41 and Ext.6327/41). His report on his visit is interesting. He reviews Iraqi sentiments towards the Briti (pp.2, 4 and 5) and the grievances of the desert Arabs, the Kurds and the Jews (p.3). He points out the difficulty of finding ^suitable Ministers and Government officials the pernicious system by which Government employees are dependent on favouritism for their continued employment His estimate of the character of Rashid Ali will be found on p.4 and of the Regent^ Abdul Ilah, on p.7. A letter from H.M. Ambassador, Bagdad, to the Viceroy giving an appreciation of the Nawab*s visit and of his interest in and generous gifts to the Indian troops in Iraq is flagged at Ext.7365/41.

I have decided to write two separate notes, one referring to Iraq, the other the Middle East* The former I now venture to submit for Your Excellency's perusal. 1 hope that there may be something in this further note which may possibly be of interest to Your Excellency. I have endeavoured to put domi just irfiat I personally experienced. The manner in which I have dealt with the various matters may, 1 am afraid, be considered as rather crude and lacking correct phraseology for which 1 hope I may be excused, and for any ether mistakes which may occur in this note. In conclusion my most earnest and sincere wish is to convey through this letter my extreme gratitude for lour Excellency's goodness and generosity in affording me again the opportunity to render further service towards a cotuDon I end this letter with the earnest prayer that Allah the Most Merciful, Just and Compassionate may shower His choicest gifts on my beloved master His Imperial Majesty cause.the hing Bnperor, and may He bring about the subjugation of the brutal force that now stands up against all that is clean, beautiful and right in this our world, and that He may bring about a glorious victory to the Imperial Forces and our Allies. With every sincere wish for Your Excellencies 1 welfare, health and happiness. \f Ct Yours respectfully His Excellency The Most Honourable The Marquess of Linlithgow, P.C., K.T., Gr.M.S.I., C.B.E., D.L., T.D., Viceroy and Governor General of India, Viceroys House, New Delhi.Iraq . Before I proceed further with this note on my second visit to Iraq, I may be permitted to express my very sincere gratefulness to His Excellency the Most Honourable the Marquess of Linlithgow, Viceroy and Governor General of Indii for His Excellency’s further mark of kindness in enabling me to again proceed to Iraq on special duty. In May last I had the pleasure of submitting to His Excellency the Viceroy a note on my first visit to Iraq (April and May 1941). This note deals with my second visit to Iraq (August to October 1941). I respectfully venture to bring to the notice of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General certain points and my observations during my visit to Iraq, and also a few remarks on my visit to various countries in the Middle East. t g.., 2 Q th ... QQt . 9 ^e r ., 1 9 Jl. I may here be permitted to express my very deep sense of gratitude to His Excellency Sir Kinahen Cornwallis, British Ambassador, Baghdad, who has on so many occasions shown his satisfaction and appreciation of my humble efforts in attending to certain matters entrusted to me, and also for His Excellency’s requesting that I should be sent out to Iraq again thus affording me the opportunity of rendering further services to my beloved Ting Emperor and the cause of Empire. I kept myself constantly in touch with His Imperial Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad and worked in very close co-operation with the staff of the Embassy to whom I am very/-A A. See p°^ c ^^ rfaoivi 'RasW.v* 'Set*'*' -( 2 )- grateful for the sincere support and extreme courtesy which was extended to me at all times, and who never failed me in giving all assistance within their power. During this period I renewed many previous acquaintences and also got to know many important personalities (a list of names enclosed). I also had the opportunity of making some exceedingly useful contacts in the country, specially at Najaf-i-Ashraf, Karabala-i-Kaulvi and Kazmain. I have in my possession 'Fatwa' by (1) Kaulvi Mohammad Hussain Kashif-ul-Chataya and a written request for financial help from (2) His Holiness Hujjat-ul-Islam Ab&lt;|ul Hassan Fusawi Asfhani. Vdioever I met, one and all were very considerate and many very helpful. I had occasions of having very many free and frank talks on questions relating to:- (a) The unhappy events during and after the Rashid Ali el Grillani’s Premiership. (b) The feelings of the Iraqi people towards Great Britain. (c) Association of Iraq with His Majesty's Government. (d) The friendly aid offered by His Majesty's Govern ment to Iraq and its people. (e) General Islamic feeling towards the Axis. (f) The steps taken by us in Iran. (g) Our support to and co-operation with the U.S.S.R. As a result of these talks I gathered that while the more cultured and understanding gentry were calm and unperti ed, and in many respects helpful, the middle and lo^er clasi were in the majority undoubtedly rather hostile and unreliable but in a very guarded and secretive manner. I could not help but notice that a large number of the people I met appeared to show a certain amount of anxiety, restlessness and suspicion, this I think is due to the affairs in Iraq being so unstable and unreliable, also to some extent anxiety is ieaj\ OS shovm regarding Iraq's future after the war. I found that three distinct elements, or should I call ohem classes, have a p^petual grievance, and at various occasions have shown some discontent. They are: (1) The desert Arabs. (2)The Kurds, and (3) the Jews. They complain that they have no voice in the Government of the country, since they are not representced in the Ministry. This I think is in r ny respects a just claim. Ministers usually come frdma very select number of people who I believe are very limited, and I understand the reason given for the non-inclusion of the three classes mentioned above is, that they cannot produce qualified men to hold office ir the Cabinet. I have noticed that in the educational Policy of Iraq, these three classes have not received sufficient encouragement , so as to enable them to produce capable rnen to hold high and ..'jLiponsible positions in the country's Government. fae Kurds are a tribe who keep very much to themselves. Though once they were very eager to be formed into a separate administration, I understand that j,his feeling has now more or loss ceased to exist, but they complain that the Iraq Government aoes nothing to better their conditidhs of life in their country in the way of educational, agricultural and other facilities. In the case of the Jews who are of course the oneyed olass in tne country, there are some individuals who could even aspire to Ministerial position, but owing to the whole community being despised there appears no possibility of this osntittlity o.oing very much in the country P at present. In fact if it were permitted a great number of Jews families would be only too pleased to emigrate to India. I understand that this has so far been .. „ —-(4)- discouraged by His Iiaje 8 ty f s Grovernmeiit. From reliable sources I learnt that very feftr capable Iraqi gentlemen are available who could hold the office of Cabinet Minister. In fact in the last few months every one capable appears to have had the opportunity of holding Ministerial position but not for very long and this difficu?.ty appears to be very acute. During the course oi a conversation I had with a very distinguished personality at the Embassy and when I happened to mention the name of Rashid Ali el Grillani, I v/as not surprised when he was mentioned to have been the cleverest and most able man to have neld the position of Prime Minister oi Iraq, and that even regrets were expressed on his having gone to the other side. I was rather interested to hear these remarks as I have all along been of the opinion that he could have undoubtedly been very useful to us had we been able to persuade him to have appreciated our point of view in regards to the British Ira^i,Treaty obligations. Unfortunately matters took a turn for the worst, and tne army leaders (the G-olden Square) precepitated matters oy forcing him to adopt such a course of Policy, by which it became impossible and inadvisable to negotiate with him any further, as his further activities became detrimental to the interests of both Iraq and thoseof his Majesty^ 4 Government. The suosequeno action taken by his Majesty's Gove resulted in his fleeing the country with hie henchmen, is believed that he is now in Germany while his friends been brought back from Iran and are now standing their trial at Baghdad. Many people whom I met were very sorry for what had ^ taken place during May and June and some even went so far as to freely confessing that they well deserved the treatment they Gontd. 'had received, and that it was truly their own fault, some cursed Rashid Ali el Gillani for having brought so much misery upon them and their country. Yet in spite of this I feel tnat there is still a very strong under-current of discontent and suspicien and the desire I to make trouble when the occasion should arise, this is strong- | er amongst the middle and lower classes of whom unfortunately over 60% Anti-British. The constant Ministerial changes in Iraq are not only harmful to the country but are a cause of continuous set-backs to our interest in that country, and the desire to see a popular Grovernment permanently settled in Iraq. It is natural that having no confidence in their Govern ment the minds of the people are apt to being influenced by undesirable and trouble seeking elements, rich and poor all suffer alike and the Government employees must undoubtedly suffer the most. Unlike, cultured and civilized countries where wheir a pr Cabinet Minister relinquishes his office, the subordinate staff still continues to be employed and the employees have no fear of losing their livlihood, but are assured of receiving a pension or a bonus on retirement, and even have the opportunity of obtaining employment for their sons and other relations. Unfortunately in a country like Iraq this is not so, the employees are more or less introduced into the various administrative departments by benefactors, and usually are favouritds. It is obvious that where such a state of affairs exists, that Government can hardly hope to be prosperous or progressive. From what I have seen of Iraq from Mosul in the extreme West to Basrah in the extreme East, there is ample scope for agricultural development, there is an abundance of water supply, and some very good land exists which could produce good,results, unfortunately there is a great lack of funds, and also settlers are hard to be found just now as the prospects offered are not too cheerful.— - r w* ta^ - 6 - Iraqi Forces: The Iraqi Forces still continue to exhibit in a very submiss- » ive manner some resentment at the sttbacks they received during their difficulties in May and June last. It is now to be seen if any good can be obtained by utilizing Iraqi Troops for Internal Security, or for the defence of the lines of comnuni- cations. 1 understand the matter has been discussed with the Iraqi authorities on many occasions and something useful may have been decided upon by now. Though while I was still in the country tllere wa 8 considerable opposition to any such arrangement, and tv*, the Cabinets that have been formed in Baghdad from time to time, have all been unable to guarantee any satisfactory scheme in supporting our earnest efforts to better the position of Iraq and its affairs. I sincerely hope that the new Premier, General Nuri Elsaid Pasha and his colleagues will be more fortunate and that they , 7 i_: x be able to give us more solid support than their prede cessors were able to give, I am rather doubtful if he is really very popular with the Iraqi people as I have mentioned above, there is still so much discontent that a really strong Cabinet coula only oe able to bring things back to a normal and satis factory condition. I have noted that some very beneficial ehanges in many internal arrangements of the Government of Inaq have been brought about since the collapse of the Gillani Government, and that cortam rather Cangerous elements have now been replaced by more sober and sensible ones, for example the 'Fatuha* movement has /iow entirely disappeared and a healthy scout movement has taken its place. There is not much more to mention about Iraq, generally on tne surface all is going on as best as is possible under the existing circumstances in the country. Schemes for Rail and Road building are progressing# -7- rapidly, all tre troops that I have met and came into contact with in biie country have a pearea to me to be quite fit and cheerful, though it is noticeable that many units consist of very very young men, I have found that there is a &amp; reat scarcity of amusements for the troops, 1 am taking steps to ao something in my humble manner and intend to discuss this matter with both His Excellency the Governor of the Punjab and the HorPble the Premier. I would also like very much to approach The Array Headquarters at Delhi on this subject, there are many other not small matters of this kind, but are/of such an importance as to be mentioned here. During my stay at Baghdad His Excellency the Ambassador arranged with the Palace Authorities for me to interview the Regent, His Royal Highness the Prince Abdul Ilah, maternal uncle of the minor King His Majesty Fasil II of Iraq. I was much impressed by the Prince who is well educated in English having lived in England for sometime. Being cultured and so much accustomed to Western ways 1 am sure he feels very lost where there is no one of his own position with whom he can A/W f • associate himself or have company. He is of a very retiring and shy nature and very much keeps to himself, amongst European company he is always at home and happy. It is indeed a very great pity tnat as a result of this shyness ana reserve His Hignness does not go out sufficiently by which, 1 mean paying social visits to the different parts of the country and attending such functions that would lead to his popularity and be a cause of confidence and satisfaction to the public. On the 8 th of September I rnaue the aoove suggestion to Mr. Holman, Counsellor to His Excellency the Ambassador, Bagdad and on the Ihth cf September during the course of a talk with His Excellency Sir Miles Lampson at Cairo, His Excellencymentioned that in a message from Baghdad he had come to know that this advice had been conveyed to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent. give a dinner party in my honour at the Palace and after dinner in the presence of His Excellency the Ambassador conferred upon me the Order of the 'Rafidain' 1st class and lour decorations of the same Order 111 class were bestowed upon the four senior members of ihy Staff. I am sure that His Excellency the Ambassador at Baghdad will have acquainted His Majesty’s Government in India of the situation that now exists in that country, and that the information will be even ma-e recent, and I sincerely pray very assuring and that an era of goodwill and understanding oetween both Governments has commenced bringing confidence and satisfaction.

Maulana Moh'amed Bashir of Taxila, Punjab, was the first of the ’’religious dignitaries” chosen by the Government of India to go to Iraq and Persia for propaganda purposes, he was to travel as an ordinary pilgrim, and arrived in Iraq on the 16th March, where he entertained Ulemas and Mujtahids and received certificates of Ijtihad. He appears to have fallen foul of most of the cumuli VW British h mb assy at Baghdad, and also of the administrators of the Oudh bequest and of the Vice-Consul at Baghdad, Khan^Sahib Tahir Hussain Sahib Qureshi, who originated the idea of these propaganda pilgrimages (P.Z.5013/40). He accuses Qureshi of giving away information, and of r&amp;i.llxig i »0 forward his reports, which,he says, came into the hands of Rashid Ali’s Government and led to his arrest as a spy by the Iraqi Police. Bashir was thrown into Baghdad jail, and thence taken via the Police iraining School, where ne was questioned about his reports, to a prison camp, from which he was released at the suppression of the rebellion. in Iraq (pages 7-11), and suggestions for future propaganda there (pages 11 and 12 ). x Bashir arrived in Persia on the 19th June, and on pages 13-16 of his report he reviews public opinion there and telrs of the measures he took to counter anti—British propaganda from Iraq and to discount German propaganda. - which he oould visit in the guise of an ordinary pilgrim, Bashir married the daughter of a Qizalbash family', and thus had an excuse to travel about Persia to visit her relations, and also to return there at will. He intends to train his v/ife, v/ho is ’’very cute and adept at propaganda” for work among Persian v/omen.

I replied that I did not wish to bargain but if my work was approved by Government, I would then be in a position to ask for a suitable reward. I left Taxila on the 19th February and travelled across Iran to Iraq where I arrived on the 16th i March. 2 . I£v preliminary work in Iraq .- To start with I tried to gain jj contacts with the various religious bodies through which I arranged to convene several religious meetings in Kerbela and Nejef in which I delivered religious lectures. In these gather ings thousands of people used to collect and I provided them with tea, fruit and other refreshments as is customary in that country. ; Subsequently I used these Anjumans for advertising myself. Consequently big religious luminaries and Mujtahids of that country came to know about my knowledge of religion and abilities as a religious missionary. My pupils who are at present students in Kerbela and Ilejef, took their full share in this propaganda, and very soon the following Ulemas and Mujtahids started calling on me. During my conversation with them I took every opportunity of converting them to my own point of view:- (1) Aghai Sheikh Mohd. Hussain Kashif-ul-Ghata. ( 2 ) ' ( 2 ) ' (4) ' (5) * ( 6 ) ' (7) * ( 8 ) ' (9) * ( 10 ) Abdul Hassan Ispahan!, byed Mohs an Hakim. Zia Iraqi. Syed Hassan Iraqi. Syed Mohd. Ali Tabrezi..

(14) •1 Syed Ali Nuri Arab. (15) « Murawij Mohd. Raza Khorasani. (16) it Sheikh Hussain Arab Rais. (17) it Syed Mohd. Shahrudi. (18) M Syed Mirza Hassan Najwardi. (19) It Hujjat Kerbelai. i 1 The above named Ulemas came to me frequently and I also returnecf their calls. This went on for about a whole week during which I the conversation was mainly confined to religious controversies I and discussions of intricacies of theology. All this resulted in these Ulemas giving me certificates of Litihad . Armed with these certificates my dignity and integrity was established amongst the people of Iraq and whatever I said in my sermons and speeches was accepted with trie authority of religious I^atwahs. 3. German propaganda in Iraq .- On my arrival in Iraq and asa result of my mixing among the various societies I came to know that the Iraqis had great respect and sympathies for the Congress in India and also for Germany in Europe. The reason for this was that the German secret agents had succeeded in creating intimate social contacts with the students in colleges and schools whom they always asked to their tea parties and invited them to their educational lectures and helped them in their learning modern games and the art of mixing with Europeans socially. In addition to these German agents, the Ulemas of Iraq had attributed the problem of Hejaz, destruction of shrines in Madina and Mecca, the assistance rendered to the Jews in Palestine and general tyranny upon the Mussulmans, to the British, whom they described as the enemies of Islam and had thereby aroused a general feeling of religious resentmentj—— u J -3- egainst them. Germany had thus succeeded in both these forms of propaganda and both the educated and uneducated classes had become hostile to the British. 4. Reasons for failure of British propaganda in Iraq .-Against the above two lines taken in the German propaganda, the arrangements made by the British were of an ephimeral and spasmodic nature. The individuals selected by the British for their work were unreliable. From the following incidents it will appear that while some of the British agents were in league with the enemy agents, others were known as British agents by every Arab in the street. For instance Allama Abul Kasim and his son Syed Sadiq, Sheikh Abdul Karim Zanjani and Aghai Hujjat. These gentlemen not only gave themselves away but also gave a bad name to other good workers. Consequently they often had to resort to anti-British propaganda in order to get rid of the name of 'spy' from themselves. Among these who were unreliable or who were short-sighted and careless in their behaviour were those in the service of the British ^nbassy in Iraq, whose manner of work, integrity and general behaviour detracted from their value as suitable propagandists, for example Khas^Gahib Tahir Hussain Sahib Qureshi, Vice-Consul, who gpve away political secrets and acted with lack of responsibility in other matters as shown in the following Ik instances. When I reached Iraq I found that the Khuddams of Kerbela and Nejef already knew about my visit although I had never written to them or informed any one about my proposed visit to Iraq. Subsequently I also heard that Haulvi Mohd.Razi of Lucknow was coming to do propaganda in Iraq, a news which I consistently contradicted and it was just as well that he never reached Iraq. Maulvi Mohd. R a zi is my pupil. I know him | very well. I deprecate his selection because he is childish and is therefore not worthy of such an important work. Afterwards in Kerbela I also heard about His Hi^iness the Hawab of Bahawalpur f s visit. People said that he had also come for -HvJ ■^i, 6 . - 4 - propa^anda purposes. ’Thatever money he gave to the Khuddams of Kerbela, people put it down to British propaganda purposes. The news that the Nawab of Bahawalpur gave money to Agjiai Kashif“ul-Ghata was given away everywhere and this brought about such serious and undesirable consequences as to force this religious luminary to give a ?ntwah of Jehad against the British — in order to save his face and maintain his prestige. The biggest proof I have against the staff of the Embassy is in regard to my weekly reports which I used to submix to Mr.Qureshi. Not one of these was ever sent to the Embassy nor to Delhi in spite of the fact that I used to give him two copies of my reports, one addressed to H.M f s Ambassador, Baghdad and the other to MajorjShah in Delhi. 5. The evidence against non-despatch of my reports .- 'Then the war started Mr.Qureshi was in Kerbela and he had kept my reports with him as he did not want the Govt, of India and the Embassy to see my reports. As a result of this all these reports got into the hands of the Govt, of Rashid Ali who ordered that I should be traced and arrested. I was in Kazemain at that time when the police found me and hand-cuffed me. I was then hurled into a small room in the Baghdad jail, with hand-cuffs on, where they used to beat me mercilessly. Subsequently order^s were passed for my execution. They showed me my reports as proof of my guilt as a spy. A nr hours they used to hang me up by a rope tied to ceiling with my hands tied behind my back. The news of my death reached Kazemain and Kerbela where the rites of obsequies were actually perfcmed. Suddenly I was sent to the Police Training School for further examination. The behaviour of the police here was such that I would have preferred death to it a thousand times. Fortunately my reports were couched in ambiguous terms. It was not therefore possible for any one other than those to whom they were addressed, to know their real meaning. Some of these reports I-R- were against Oongi' , ess and in favour of the Muslim League and | the British and during the investigations I had an opportunity I of talking to one of the Police officers who was a Shia Mussulman. I took the opportunity to say to him that I an a Shia Mussulman from India and that in India there is an overwhelming majority of Hindus who are against the M u ssalmans .r- The Hindus have formed the Congress and the l^slims have formed the Muslim League which carries the support of the ij British. Without British support, Muslims would be destroyed by the Hindus majority. It was with this object that I sided with the British and my religion enjoins me to do so because I am a British subject and service of the Rulers is what is advised by the Quran. After this I gave this official a bribe of £11/* and asked him to take a letter from me to Aghai Kashif-ul-Ghata, Mujtahid-i-Nejef. He agreed to do so and delivered my letter to the Mujtahid who at once began to work for my rescue. He wrote commendatory letters to Govt, officers and also a general letter to all the Iraqis and sent it to me. The purport of this letter was as follows:- ! I Maulvi Mohd. Bashir is a renowned Alim and a Muslim missionary. He has no connection with political matters. I call upon all the Mussulmans to help him and treat him with respect and honour. It was the result of this writing that the Police stopped molesting me and it began to dawn upon the Iraqis that I was not a spy. I have submitted a copy of Aghai Kashif-ul- Ghata’s letter to the Embassy and I give below its true copy. I have retained the original toith myself.- 6 - Scme time before my release I ms sent to the Prisoners* Camp where ther- were also other Indian and British prisoners. Aeroplane bombs were dropped near this camp and our lives were in imminent danger. A few days later the war ended and I was set free. I at once nent to Kerbela and renewed my contacts with the Ulemas and rebuked them for giving Fatwahs of Jehad against the British. They told me that they had doi.e so because they were afraid of Rashid Ali but that they had deliberately included the word H self-defence M in the Fatwah. Another evidence of the unreliability of the staff of the Embassy is apparent from the attitude of the individuals who have been selected to control the distribution of money from Cudh Bequest, an attitude which is definitely dangerous to the British cause. I give below a short account of each of these gentlemen. (1) Syed Abdul Farah. Treasurer. Oudh Bequest. Kerbela . Ihen the hostilities started this man induced 25 British Indian subjects to appear before the Deputy Commissioner, Kerbela (Mutasarrif) who was told that these men had come to offer themselves to figjit against the British and he was asked that he should give them arms. As a result the Government of Rashid Ali appreciated Syed Abdul Farah , s action and he was officially thanked. He was, however, told that these men were not required. (2) Syed Sadiq, Member of the Committee of Oudh Bequest , Kerbela .- This man also joined hands with (1) above in inducing these poor Indians to appear before the Deputy Commissioner. He used to visit the Deputy Commissioner who was known to be a friend of Rashid Ali*s and he also gave him regular reports about the Indian British subjects and also openly indulged in anti-British propaganda. (3) Sheikh Shamshad Hussain. Distributor. Ondh Bequest . Neief .“ This man directed hit propaganda against myself, IfeulviMaulvi Mohd. Razi, the Nawab of Bahawalpur and also against certain Firs of Mohra Sharif, District Rawalpindi, who were then present in Iraq. He used to tell people that we are all spies of the British Government and he used to induce the Ulemas of Iraq to issue Fatwah against the British and this was probably why Rashid Ali f s Government did not arrest him. All the above mentioned individuals have been appointed by the British Government and they receive salaries from the hands of the British. They are all unreliable, irres ponsible, fickle-minded, and conceited individuals and their presence is detrimental to the British cause. (4) It is my considered opinion that as Controller of Distribution of Oudh Bequest, Khan Sahib Tahir Hussain Qureshi's position, his behaviour and his character are such that if he remained connected with this work, it would produce most disastrous results. 6 . How I carried out my propa/^nda in Iraq .- ^en I arrived in Iraq and got to know the true state of affairs in that country, I started a regular and systematic tour of lectures and religious sermons which produced very satisfactory results. I may however mention that all this propaganda line was conceived by me and is the outcome of my brain. Nowhere I received any 0 iidance from the British authorities as to the line I should take in my propaganda. The general themes of my propaganda were as follows:- (1) Islam has said that one should sacrifice money to save one’s life and life should be sacrificed to save one’s religion. In these days both life and property as well as religion are secure under the British Government who have given their subjects complete religious liberty. I am( 3 ) - 8 - v-&gt; ^ 7 *-; J£ ' ^ Art \&gt; ^ 1 I C' | ^ ' a missionary and I have carried out many controversies with Christian missionaries. In other words I have worked against the religion of the State. Other missionaries do the same but British Government have never tried to stop us. It is this Christian Government which has given its subjects liberty to follow Islam. On the other hand in Muslim countries \ religion is not safe; for example - (1) There are restrictions against the performance of religious duties in Iran where mata* (tanporary marriage) is now an offence under the law. (ii) Turkey. - Prayers are now said in the Turkish language, (iii) Heiaz.- The structrues over the shrines of Prophet and other holy personages have been destroyed. ( iv) Afghanistan. - No Shia can say his prayers according to the Shia religion. (v) In India before the British arrived, hundreds of Ulemas were executed in xi gra and Delhi. No hhia could express his faith openly. 3yen today in Agra and Dplhi the shrines of Shahid-i-Sails and Shaid-i-Rabi, (the 3rd and the 4th Martyrs) speak of these acts of tyranny which still make one f s heart shudder. (vi) Iraq. - T 7e Indians come to Iraq because the shrines of our religious heads are situated here who were mercilessly slaughtered by the Iraqis. All these instances show how cruel and merciless the Muslim Governments have been to their fellow Mussalmans an 1 how the children of the Prophet were ill-treated. The British have, on the other hand, never done such a thing. (2) During the incident of Kerbela an Englishman arrived in the court of Yazid and when heard about the butchery of Kerbela he called Yazid had names for allowing such acts of cruelty to be practised on the children of the Prophet. Yazid ordered him to be executed and we still sing the praise of that Englishnan in our religious sermons.(i) -9- (3) In accordance with the beliefs of liuslim religion, Jesus Christ is alive, 'lien our 12th Imam appears again, Christ will come down from Heaven and say his prayers behind our Imam and lend him his support. Nov; we wish to find God Almighty’s reason for keeping Christ alive and allowing the remaining 1,24,000 Prophets to pass away. To should refer to the prophecy of the holy Prophet who said that when Imam Mehdi re-appears, Christians shall be ruling the world and their Empire will remain until the Imam appears. This is mentioned in the book ’Bisharat-ul-Islam’ which is publish ed in Nejef (Iraq). 'Then Christ comes down from Heavens he will ordain that his people should believe in luieta Ilehdi and the majority of those who will help the Imam will be Christians. See Bahar-ul-Anwar printed in Teheran and Baghdad. (4) In tiie 6 th chapter of the Quran you will find the following 'You will find that your enemies will be Jews and idolaters and you will find that your friends will be Christians because the latter follow their religion and they are humble and meek'. In India Gandhi and his disciples are in great majority. According to Quran, they should be counted as enemies of Islam. The Mussalmans of India should not therefore be friendly with Hindus, but consider English men as their friends because they support Mussalmans a^inst tne Hindus. If the English were not to help the.Mussalmans they would have been destroyed by the Hindu majority. In this way I countered the Congress propaganda in Iraq and this is a most useful quotation from the Quran in favour of gaining the sympathies of Mussalmans. 7. My propaganda during the r ul e of Rashi d Ali’s Govt .- In addition to the above propaganda, I adopted the following themes.— &gt; r— - 10 - (i) Ikzrat All ruled over Iraq for five years. His experiences about the Iraqis are important. I used to recite the following sayings of Ali in a whispering campaign, therefore the Iraqis could not contradict me - (a) 'Oh people of Iraq, your character is very low; your religion is treachery, your outside is different from your inside, you break your word, your water is brackish and you help to create the means of your own destruction.' Rashid Ali has broken his pact with the British and has therefore brou^it about the means of his own destruction. (b) 'Oh Iraqislyou are like that pregiant woman who carries her child for 9 months and at the end of that period brings about a miscarriage.' Hie Iraqis were complete savages. Their country was uncivilised. The British brought with them civilisation to Iraq and tau^it Iraqis how to live and eat and drink like human bein^. Now that they have achieved the heights of civilisation, the Iraqis have started fighting against the same British who brought them all this good c.f. the miscarriage of the Iraqi woman in the final stages of pregnancy. (c) 'Oh Iraqis! money is your religion and adul^ry is your goal'. Rashid Ali has taken £1,00,000/- from the Germans and now wants to make his people figjit against , their own benefactors, the British. For 15 days before outbreak of trouble I carried on this propaganda which continued for 3 days after the war started i.e.until I was arrested. w-re-AA. ! } (ii) 'Abdul Ilah will come back and the Rebel Rashid Ali will run away'. In the book 'Alaim-ul-Zakir' and the book 'Nur-ul-Anwar 1 the Imam has said that there will be a war in Iraq and Abdul Ilah (or Abdulla,) will come from the direction of Palestine to Baghdad and after his entry inr- 9 i - 11 - in Iraq / \^ the rebels will be punished. This prophecy ereated a great deal of resentment against Rashid Ali but unfor tunately I was soon arrested. 8 . IJtL s lu £’es t i ons m^ rdin,: I raq. - (i) The connections of Tahir Hussain Qureshi, Sheikh Shamshad Hassan, Distributor, Syed Abdul i'arah, Treasurer, Syed Sadiq, Member, should be severed from the administration of Oudh Bequest. Their presence in Iraq is harmful to the British cause. Instead of these men more reliable and capable men should be appointed. (ii) T 7ell known and digiified Ulemas should be sent to Iraq who should follow my line of propaganda and counter the propaganda of the Ulemas of Iraq. (iii) Educated young people should be sent to Iraq who can mix with the educated classes and students in colleges and schools. If such men are conversant with religion, it would add to their value. (iv) Both the Ulemas as well as the young educated individuals wjtfould be Indians because the Arabs are fond of Indians and hate the people of Hejaz and Iran. (v) The management of the Oudh Bequest should be entrusted to an Arab Mujtabid preferably to Agjiai Kashif- ul-Ghata who should be induced to take over the management of the fund. This man wields great influence in Iraq. He will always be able to turn the situation ijfi favour of the British and even if there is some opposition he can overcome it easily. (vi) I have persuaded Sheikh iibdul Kasim, Khuddam of the Kazemain to assist in the British propaganda. This man is very reliable. He also knows the technique of propaganda. He is very shrewd and can exerciae considerable influence both among the urban and rural areas of Iraq. He 11 5He is prepared to help the British cause. I could not, however, get an opportunity to inform the Embassy about this man. Mo Indian should be sent to approach this man. Only a Britisher can settle this affair. In Iraq I found the Captain who is propaganda wi* - &lt;Wnin Secretary to the Embassy, a very intelligent man and £*.rw 7 ?rcs S - capable officer. If only other men like him could he sent to Iraq there would be a chance of British propaganda to succeed. I left Iraq on the 17th June for Iran.’ | -13- ? T ro^ m 0 ! T HAN. On the 19th June I crossed the frontier of Iran and arrived at Qasr-i-Shirin. 1. How I started mv work in Iran.- As I was one of the new-cotaers from Iraq, many Iranians used to gather round me and enquire about the events connected with the war. Wherever I went in Iran, I found the people inquisitive about Iraqian affairs. I also found that the war in Iraq had produced a profound effect in Iran. There were rumours that the British had destroyed the shrines of Kerbela, Kazemain and that of Abdul Qadir Gilani in Baghdad. There were rumours that some mosques had been destroyed. Another harmful form of propaganda had taken the line that the British forces were weak and they had taken a whole month to defeat the Iraqian army. How could they fight with Germany and Hitler who takes over countries within a few hours. I countered this propaganda by narrating the events which I had seen with my own eyes. I assured the people that the shrines were all intact and told them how Rashid Ali had taken bribes from the Germans and how after leaving his own Arabs to their fate, he had run away to Iran. I also told them that Rashid Ali had emptied the entire treasury and had removed gold and jewellery from all the banks. I said that he had brought with him 25 big boxes full of money which was really the property of the Iraqis. I added that he is now in Teheran eating, drinking wine and taking part in un-Islamic music and dances. 2. Reasons f or the war in Iraq iaeinp; protracted one .- (i) I explained that this was not a war against the Iraq Government but against Rashid Ali and his rebels. As Rashid Ali f s Government was not accepted by any other country in the world, the English forces were sent to Baghdad-14- Baghdad and other cities not with the idea of annexing these cities to their own ^pire, but to prepare the way for Abdul Ilah to come back and take over as Head of the legitimate Government. The British forces did not want to destroy Iraq but confined their fight only against the rebels. They continuously dropped leaflets which informed the Iraqis that this was not a fight a^inst them. The British did not wish to destroy the Iraqi an army and they kept on giving them time in which they could save themselves. This was one of the causes of delay. (ii) Rashid Ali had assured that the Germans would come to his assistance at any moment. The British therefore deliberately allowed him time, just to show that the promises of aid made by Germany were false ones. Germany could not send any troops to help Iraq and it was due to German machinations that the Iraqis were made to fight against the British. 3. ?alse propaganda against the British .- It was said that the British had demanded from Rashid Ali that he should surrender his army to the British and authorise them to fight against Germany and that upon his refusal, the British had attacked the Mussalmans. I countered this by saying that the British never asked for any troops but they only wanted to implement their treaty ri^jits and station their army in that country. It was Rashid Ali who broke the treaty clause and said that both the trekty and those who had helped to make it were dead. He issued orders that the British must depart from Iraq within 24 hours and subsequently attacked the unprepared Cantonment of Habbania. 4. Ill-treatment of Indiangby Rnshid Ali^ ~ As soon as the war started, Rasnid All's Government started arresting Indians. All Indian pilgrims were put in jail and they were subjected to unspeakable cruelties. Even their women folk were locked up in the same cells as men, whereC +9 -15- where these poor women could not uncover their faces nor could they rest or sleep. Indian prisoners were locked up before sunset and therefore they could not say their evening prayers. They were not allowed out before sunrise and therefore they could not say their morning prayers. This treatment was in such mi contrast to the freedom allowed to Iraqi prisoners in Habbania, who could visit their mosques, temples and churches. 5. My tour in Iran on lorries .- In Iran I deliberately travelled in lorries because this mode of transport enabled me to meet large number of urban and rural people and do propaganda amongst them. 6 * Public opinion in Iran .- 80?S of Iranians are anti- (h British and the same number is against Raza Shah. Of the [ao'\ * ^ 1 \ remaining 20% who are in favour of R a za Shah, not one is in I favour of the British. In Iran everybody talks about Hitler, so much so that even women tall* of Germany. 7. Reasons for anti-British feeling in Iran .- Iranians believe that all laws and restrictions against religion such as removal of purdah, liberty to sell wine and pigs meat in open shops and restrictions upon ceremonies of Moharrum and Mata* have been introduced at the instigation of the British. I countered this by presenting the picture of freedom enjoyed by Mussulmans in India. I told them that during the last 100 years the British had issued no decrees against purdah or against observance of any religious custom. I stressed that the Muslim missionaries had written books against Christianity; even in those cases Government had not interfered. I suggested that these anti-religion ideas had been introduced in Iran by Germany and Turkey. The rest of my propaganda in Iran took the same lines as in Iraq. In Iran there was no danger to my life, therefore I could freely hold religious sermons some of which were attended by such high digiatories as Aghai Sadr Qummi and Aghai Hujjat Aghai Huasain Qunmi, Aghai ShahabuddinQurami and Aghai Bahani Teherani and Aghai Sabzwari. 8 . 'Vhy do the Iranians like Gpmans .- In actual fact the Iranians are against Raza Shah and they are pining for revolution. They want to kill their King so as to bring in revolution immediately. As Hitler is adding victories after victories to his naine, Iranians look to Hitler to come to Iran and create revolution. People have become so fond of Hitler that they look upon him as their own friend, so much so that they say that the country of Hitler*s fore-fathers was in Kermanshah. 9. How I countered the German propaganda .- (i) Quotation from the Quran. ’•Those who love cruel people they are not Mussalmans even if these cruel people are their own fathers, brothers or relatives'*. I explained to the Iranians that Hitler was cruel and that his wars were inhuman, he was anti-God and therefore your religion enjoins you not to trust him. If you do this you will not remain Lflussalmans. I also explained to them that Hitler was not a gpod Christian and therefore as such he was not entitled to friendship of Mussalmans. He was haughty, conceited and cruel and Muslims cannot love such a person. (ii) Hitler is a Dictator and Islam forbids dictatorship and enjoins the rule of Parliament upon Muslims. (iii) Prophesies of the Prophet such as 'in the end British will win** which I quoted from the book mentioned in my Report on Iraq, went down very well because I could also show the certificates of Ijtihad given to me in Iraq. The Ulemas of Iran also gave me similar certificates. I gave a note on my methods of work and my personal experiences to Miss Lambton and suggested that her agents should carry 'on their propaganda work on similar lines.-17- rrr&gt; 10. !!y outatandln^. service .- As I was travelling as an ordinary pilgrim and pilgrims can only visit places where there are holy shrines - and such places in Iran are only three, viz.- 1. Shah Abdul Azim. 2. Shahr Qum. 3. Meshed I could not find any excuse for visiting other towns in Iran. It is no doubt necessary that one should also stay in big towns and tour about in villages before one can succeed in his mission. To achieve this object after great efforts I succeeded in gaining contact with a very higi and noble Qizalbash family and married one of their daughters. The Government of Iran do not allow an outsider to marry an Iranian woman but owing to this family’s influence with the Government of Iran, I succeeded in obtaining the requisite permission and also got an endorse ment from the Iranian Government on my passport about my marriage. I secured this endorsement purposely so that CisV*** there should be no ^12 riiiJai-r 1 about my returning to Iran quickly. The Legation in Teheran had asked me to return to Iran quickly. This Khanum is a resident of Shiraz. She has relations in Ispahan, Teheran and Meshed. Some of her relations are in Government service, some are traders and some are owners of garages with a number of lorries which they ply on hire. Some of her relations are Ulemas and Muftis. This family is one of the most hi^ily respected family in Iran. This Khanum owns many houses by her own ri^it. Nowadays she lives in Meshed where her brother owns garages. This young lady is educated and a very fine lecturer. She has been a teachress in some industrial girls schools. She is very cute and adept in propaganda. She has vast social contacts amongst women and girl schools in Iran. Like all Iranians she has a very quick brain and a wonderful nack of understanding things quickly. I kept- I G K h tM ' 1 V \ -18- her with me for ten days and brought her from Meshed to Znhidan and made her fall in with my views. f*he also helped me a little in my work but so far I have not completed her training because I have had very little time to do so. She is not yet properly equipped to undertake a propaganda mission. I shall train her properly after T have brou^it her to India. I suggest it should be so arranged that she can live for six months in India and six months in Iran for the purposes of propaganda. Her passport, etc. were not completed therefore I could not bring her to India and had to send her beck from Z^hidan to Meshed. This marriage of mine would offer a good cover for my visiting Iran again. I can now visit all big cities and meet the big families in Iran because this Qizalbash family has great influence all over Iran. I contracted this marriage purely for propaganda reasons and only because the Legation insisted that I'should return to Iran soon and do propaganda in oti^er places and so that the lady should do propaganda amongst womenfolk. I had no personal necessity for a second marriage. I am already happily married and have children. I had no reason to marry again or to give an undertaking that this lady could live six months in Iran and six months in India. 11. My suggestions about Iran .- (i) Some suitable men should be sent to Iran for propaganda very quickly. They should act according to my suggestions. They should be selected tx in consultation with me. Their main work should be to make the Iranians believe that it is not true that the British have brought about these changes in religion. (ii) The British Government should help the Iranian people by using their good offices with the Iranian Government with a view to resuscitating religion in thatthe people of Iran know that the British are helping in restoring religion. (iii) Seised. (iv) At the end of June I submitted a report to the Legation in Teheran saying that, there are a large number of Germans in that country wno have arrived th^re under the garb of traders and tourists. The Legation should take early steps to remove these Germans from Iran. (v) There should be a Vice-Consul at Birjand. At present the only official there is a clerk. Large number of travellers from Meshed, Zaliidan and Zabul stay there. It is therefore necessary that the staff of the Vice- Consulate should be s trengthened. I surest that Birjand snould be placed under Zahidan and not under Zabul although it is nearer Zabul. The Vice-Consul, Zabul is a young officer and only a beginner. Besides Z a bul is not an important place from the political point of view. (vi) Indian traders should be encouraged to go to Birjand.. The whole of Iren needs Indian traders but these traders should be supported by British Government because at present the traders in Teheran and Birjand are so frightened that they cannot mention the name of the British before an Iranian. These traders should be Shia Mussalmans and they should have good knowledge of politics and religion. (vii) The biggest Mujtahid^ in Qum, Aghai Byed Shahabuddin is prepared to do British propaganda. I have given his report to the Legation in Teheran. He is the biggest Mujtahid and the most influential Alim in Iran. He is anti-R a za Shall and therefore most useful at the present juncture. I suggest he should be approached. Tith his help great deeds can be performed. This man can usefully be employed in Iraq, Hejaz, Syria and Egypt as -.veil and should also be invited to come to India.f - 20 - In Iran I found Miss Lamb ton a£ ef icie JlL x k 1 8064 and intelligent as the Captain in the limb assy in Baghdad. .capable 12. My. arrival in India and Indian public opinion .- f j T 7hen I entered India I found the same ideas prevailing here about Iraq as I found in Iran. People are singing the praises of Hitler and sympathies for Germany in India are the same here as I have found in Iraq and Iran. I have foundh that some of the people in Government service are also against British and are doing pro-Hitler propaganda. In the . circumstances I think that a proper and systematic propagr ndal campaign should be started amongst the public in India as well. I am sending an account of my travels to the newspaper the hhia of Lahore. I recommend that copies of my accounts should be re-published in other papers as well and. distribut-j ed in the frontier areas and districts of Rawalpindi, Abbottabad, Peshawar, Kohat and Oampbellpore where propaganda on the lines suggested by me should be started especially amongst the Muslim Congress circles, amongst whom quotations from the Quran and publications which I have mentioned should be circulated. My journey has ended after 6 months but I am still busy with my mission.■ t . -.V4 EN0L03URK IN BAGDAD DESPATCH NO. • \ 296 DATED 213T OCTOBER. 19U1&gt; ^ J 3 Q J (217/76/41) British ISrab^tssy, Bagdad 21st October,1941.

R.T.Peel,Esquire, C.B.,M.C., External Department, India Office, London. ernal Department, India Office, Londo6./ I left Quetta on the 21at August 1941 and reached Mirjawa* on the Iranian border, on the 23rd August. I returned to Nokkundi on the 6 th September. The only reason for my coming back was the present war in Iran as a result of which all roads into that country had become dangerous. Consequently the Commander of the Persian Army refused to allow me to enter Meshed and I had perforce to return after havir^ reached very near that town. 2. I was in Bir jand at the time of declaration of war in Iran. It was the 25th Augpst. The next day I heard on the radio that negotiations for peace were afoot so I took courage and started for Meshed. 3. During all my journeys I heard complaints from the Iranians about bribery and highhanded methods employed by Iranian official, against their fellow countrymen who were sick of these cruelties 4. The Iranian officials are always on the look out for robbing the pilgrims and tourists. I too had to face such difficulties at different places. Iranian officials are always drunk. I have seen some of them drunk even while on duty, e.g. officer in charge of Road G-uards at Mulak Siah, very near Zahidar* who was absolutely not in his senses at the time of duty. In sucl circumstances what else can be expected except cruelty? 5. While at Bir jand I heard the news that Raza Khan Pehalwi had made the Prime Minister, Ali Mansur, and Ml Cabinet to resign and had appointed Faroghi as Prime Minister instead. The former is a very staunch supporter of the Germans. At the same time as I heard the news that British and Russian forces had entered Iran via T&amp;br4* and Khanqin, I also heard that the Indian troops were advancing towards Zahidan. I found the Iran ians very jubilant at each one of these news and they said that Indian troops would also brir^ with them grain. The news was also current that the British had unloaded sufficient quantities of grain at Ahwaz.10./— 6 * When I left Birjand, a resident of Kerbelai Mualla was also with me • He pointed out that the German p: opaganda that Baghdad was heavily bombarded Jbring war in Iraq was false* He was very emphatic when he said that not a sirgle bomb had been dropped there. 7. After leaving Bir jand, I reached Gonabad on the mornii^ of the 27th August* At midday I reached tfalina whene I met an Iranian Military officer who appeared to be a nice man. He asked me where I had come from and I replied that I was an Indian and was going to Meshed on pilgrimage. On an enquiry from me this officer stated that the Russians had occupied X&amp;aah Kbochan and that they were still advancing. I asked him if in such circumstances the Turbat Police would allow us to $o ahead. He replied * Nobody knows anythirg about anybody else at this time*. Then he whispered to me '•War is inevitable. An aged Iranian has predicated that there will be a war with Iranians. He has stated somethirg about the Kigg himself as well. All these thirgs must come to pass.'* 8 . There were no signs of sadness or despondency on the face of that officer when he uttered these words. He was on the other hand very confident and composed. After two hours we reached Turbat-i-Haidari, We experienced no difficulty at the time of entry into this town but as we progressed, we came across a huge mob rushirg about in frenzied madness. They gathered round any lorry that came from Gonabad or Meshed and every one of them was distressingly enquiring about the latest news. 9. We got the news at Turbat-i-Haidari that the Russian troops had entered Chunar. We were constantly seeirg big Military and Police officers and their families rushing past from the direction of Meshed in lorries, the majority of which had Teheran Numbers on them. The distress and excitement of these men was visible from their shrivelled faces.n« nfiii .MmuTBinn ,r ~ I I MB 3 10* Some of our Iranian companions showed us some Germans and Italians too who had fled from Meshed with these Iraniana officers. We saw Germans and Italians with Iranian officers at Turbat-i-Haidari, but I could not find out where they were going* Possibly they were either trying to escape towards Afghanistan or are hiding themselves in the villages of Iran which are far removed from the main roads, and where no means of transport, except camels and donkeys, are available* It is therefore highly essential that whole of Iran should be occupied and these Germans and Italians traced and imprison* ed, thus purging the country of these poisonous elements and thereby saving India from grave darters in the future* 11* At Turbat-i-Haidari I also got the news that a member of the Iranian Parliament had deserted and joined the Germans* After leaving this place we went a little further; darkness had set in and we stopped our lorry neary one of the Coffee Houses* A few people approached and asked us to put out the lights of the lorry as a Russian aeroplane had just dropped a bomb on the neighbouring hill* They suggested that we should halt there for the night as it was dangerous to bring liftjat on that road* Our driver advised us that if it was at all necessary to halt, there was a better place some distance ahead. These villagers laid great stress on the news that Meshed and surrounding places had been heavily bombarded. We advanced according to the advice given by the driver, but it was a very odd hour as on one side there was the fear of bombardment which meant that we could not proceed with the lights on, arxi on the other the ups and downs of the hilly track, where the slightest deviation meant rolling down the deep khud-side to God knows where ! 12. It was a time of great suspense and uncertainty* With great difficulty our lorry reached Rabat Safed where we halted for the night, but could not have a sound sleep in the fear that these wild Iranians would loot us. At last the morning came/4 cama. The sun had not gone very high when we heard rumbles in m the sky f A white aeroplane was seen coming from Meshed side* This is the colour of Iranian ’planes’* So far as I have heard from Iranians, Iranian Oovernment have white aeroplanes* (When I returned the same day to !tfurbat-i-Haidari, I came to know from an Iranian that the anroplane mentionsd above contained some Germans who had fled from Meshed side, but I could not ascertain to vhich side they had gone). 13* While at Rabat Safed, again after a short interval, a similar rumbling sound was heard and we saw 3 aeroplanes flying at a terrific speed towards Turbat* Each one of these ’planes was equipped with four Lewis guns. Shortly after, these ’planes on return from Turbat, proceeded slowly towards Meshed as if in search for something. Definitely these Russian* ’planes were after those Germans who had preceded them. We were terror stricken and were afraid that these ’planes would drop bombs on us, but they did not* 14. When Russian ’planes disappeared in the distance, we hurricfedy boarded the lorry and rolled off towards Meshed. We were not so far aware that Russian tx&gt;oops had entered Meshed. A few miles beyond, a buildir^g was seen where a few cars and lorries were parked. Our lorry halted at a signal by an Iranian Military officer. People looked very much ky penturbed there. We were first told that we could go to Meshed in the evening: later we were told that we could leave imnediately, and finally, that we could not go beyond and should return to Turbat-i- Haidari. 15. TWo Iranian Military officers were standir^j on the road and inside the room was the Commander of the Meshed Army. These officers communicated to us the orders of the Commander. Lorries which contained goods were unloaded at once. The poor Iranians who* were the victims of conscription were set free immediately and were asked to go to their homes. At this place we were informed by the people that Russians had entered Meshed and/and Iranian troops had vacated that place • Lorries xsatismiiig containing soldiers rushed past at a tremendous speed and the whole army which was estimated at about 2,000 went off towards I Turbat* We too came back to Turbat with this Army* As we were climbing towards Shutar Ourdan, we saw in the distance 12 black Russian aeroplanes but they did not drop any bombs on the Iranian Army# 16* We reached Turbat-i-Haidari on the 23th August. This time we saw the inhabitants of this place in greater excitement and despair* On the roadside the people crowded round sometimesj this lorry and sometimes round another. People looked famished with hunger. There was only one shop of a bread seller which was assailed on all sides by the public and it was after about four hours f struggle that one was able to get just half a loaf and that too at a very high price# 17. In an effort to save their own lives the Iranian Army was causing immense trouble to the travelling public too. I saw with my own eyes hundreds of pilgrims from Zabul being chased off towards jungles or left in the garages and their lorries seized for military purposes. There was also with us a lorry belonging to Meshed Consulate and this too was seized and probably its whereabouts together with its driver are still not known. This motor was seized by an Iranian Military officer# The name of its driver was Sher Mohd# I also noted the name of that Iranian officer and I think the Consul-General, Meshed must be aware of it. (I saw only rifles and machine gpns with the Iranian Army but no artillery, etc. and these were taken down in the ordinary garages. The Governor of Meshed, the Military Commander and the senior officer i/c Road Guards had also travelled with us to Turbat. This time some of our Iranian companions also showed us in a small garden a few Germans who appeared to be very worried, some of whom were having a wash with water in the tank.) 18./-1 PPPBR 18* As we were thinking of leavir^ Turbat-i-Haidari, two Iranian officers came along and expressed a desire to go with us in a lorry* I have forgotten the name* of one of them, but the name of the other was Sarhang AzacL Yagana, who was a senior officer of the Road Guards at Khwaah, a military centre in Iran. Just at this time ^eggar came near me who was crying himself hoarse in praise of Russians and decrying the Iranian Government but nobody seemed to pay any heed to him* 19* I did not come across any person, except this beggar, who talked highly of Russians. At this very place, i.e. Turbat-i-Haidar i, I came across some Iranians who were saying that Russians are an uncivilised and Godless nation, and that they preferred the English to Russian a hundred times. They openly pass disparaging remarks about the Iranian Government. They ^re now thoroughly fed, up with the Government of Raza Khan Iranians that if the Iranian Army was not capable of Pahalwi. I also heard about the complaint of/opposition, why had the public money been wasted on them* People are now openly talking about the palaces built by Raza Shah at Mazandaran and the money invested by him in foreign banks* 20. Iraniaj*who associated themselves with the staff of British Consulates were severely punished and I heard of several incidents which corroborated this* Indians are even now held in derision* Iranians* said to them 'If we were in your position, we would have up-rooted the English long ago* In spite of our limited numbers, we are independent.' 21* We left Turbat-i-Haidari for Gonabad by lorry and the two Iranian officers referred to above we*e seated in the front seats. These officers expressed a feeling that the Russian attack was absolutely unexpected, otherwise the Iranian Army would have certainly opposed them* They said that Russians had attacked with armoured cars and light tanks which were supported by a large number of aeroplanes. 22. As we were pas-sing through waste lands, we came across a spot where a pilgrim, who had run away from Meshed, had halted /7 halted his lorry aixl was taking his meals • Ttie two Iranian officers got down from our lorry, gave a slap on the face of the driver of the other lorry and compelled him to leave the pilgrim there in the desert and to take them to G-onabad* The pilgrim was, however, left alone in the desert and his lorry left ahead of ours* Having left Turbat-i-Haidari, we stopped at Malina where another officer. Accountant of Sarhang Azadi, and whose name was Aghai Saadat Pazhof, got into the lorry. After reachir^ Gronabad, we learnt from an Iranian driver that Russians had bombarded Turbat-i-Haidari at midday and had occupied the town* 23* At G-onabad, in our presence, many Iranians praised English kind-heartedness and said 'we are praying Grod that English should take over the G-overnment of Iran in their own hands. No doubt the Iranian Government is our national Govern ment but these people are very cruel to us* They take work from us but refuse to pay wages. The Government officials extract money from us in various forms without paying the slightest regard to our poverty* They seize our lorries by force but refuse to pay even for the petrol* The 4 e is a rigorous control over Iranian produce and not a grain of whiat can be purchased without license from Government* No one is allowed to purchased more than his actual requirements. Sufficient quantities are being exported to Germany and arms have been purchased in return which are lyiflfi safe in a secret fort at Zahidan*. 7/e left Gonabad on 29th August for Birjand via Khadri and Shahr Qain* Not far from Shahr Qain, a lorry was waiting which was carrying some rich Iranians who had fled from Meshed. When they saw Sarhang Azadi, they came running to him and asked for the news from Meshed. Safchang replied that the Russians had occupied Meshed and Turbat and they said that according to broadcasts from London and Moscow peace negotiations were still in progress and that they would have to wait so long as the question of policy in Iran was not finally settled.8 The English and Russians also said that they would continue their advance till they were fully satisfied with the policy* The two man were rather alarmed and asked how would the British and the Russians be satisfied* Sarhang replied '•Not till all the German agents present in Iran had left that country'* Then they remarked 'If we were not strong enough to oppose, why did we not turn out those Germans in the beginning*' At this Ear hang replied in a low tone that the Iranians were all along banking on Turkey and Germany and that even then they had hopes that the German troops would soon march on the inglish and rescue Iran. Aghai Pazhof (Sarhang f s Accountant) had disclosed to me during the journey that suffi cient Iranian troops were stationed at Khwash but that provision for them were being supplied from India* The Iranians also said that they were friends of English and Russians and had trade the English and the Russians would become their enemies* 24. I told them that they themselves were responsible for such a state of affairs but for *hich nothing would have happened to them. They had no answer to this. We reached Birjand at night. The news about the expected arrival of Governor of Meshed was also current there. Nearly 200 motors which had fled from Meshed and Teheran had already arrived there. On the 30th August, it was learnt from the public at Birjand [j that traffic was entirely closed; telegraphic communication jj with Meshed had also been cut off; people were not plyirg their lorries lest they migjit be commandeered and there were in fact not many lorries as they had been taken over for military purposes. I also learnt at Birjand that there were three parties in Iran: there was the rich class which favoured the Erglish; the youth mostly favoured the Germans and there were a few who were in favour of the Russians - these probably belonged to the labourirg classes who were no doubt large in numbers but there were very few who could think for themselves. relations with them and they had not the faintest idea that (Soldiers /9 m (Soldiers in the Iranian army are only given free rations and clothing* In addition they are given four annas p*m. per head. I got this information from a very reliable source* The families of the soldiers either work as agriculturists or labourers, but most of them are beggars* Iranians are very much adicted to opium eatir^ and huge sums of money are wasted on this. Even the Police and the Array are not free from this evil habit* Iranians generally have become very ease loving and given to pleasure-seekir^ habits; bribery is rife among them; money can make them stoop to anything mean and degrading* The Iranian Oovernment have imposed so many restrictions on the movements of the public that they have to face numerous difficulties.) 25. Germans were given high posts in important departments in Iran and the German officials freely indulged, with their Iranian subordinates, in propaganda against the English. The management of the Iranian Railways was mostly in the hands of the Germans* 26. An Indian named Ali Akhtar who had distributed some religious pamphlets in Meshed was imprisoned on some political charge. The Germans on the other hand were given a free hand in spite of the fact that the Iranian Government had from time to time declared their absolute neutrality* 27. On our return from Gonabad we had with us in the lorry an Iranian soldier’s wife who was making fun of the Iranain Army in the face of the Iranian officers who would not say a word* On the 30th August when I was in Birjand, a man came with the news that the bazaar was being closed as the people were saying that the Russian troops had left Turbat in the morning for Birjand. By the evening the whole city was vacated; people hid themselves in the mountains; a fairly large number of Police as well as Military disappeared and people who were conscripted were immediately released. I found out that the officers had taken off their uniforms and dressed themselves/TkJ- themaelvea in Mufti. They had decided to receive the Huasian troopa and hand over the city to them. There waa deapair and gloom everywhere. There is a building, the property of the British, in which there lives a clerk named Abdul Rahim. Many Indiana had come to take shelter in that building. Some of tie Iranian neighbours had also expressed a desire to be sheltered in the event of an attack. One Italian too came and begged for shelter. Presumably Iranians were given refuge in that building. 28. On the 2nd September, in spite of the fact that traffic was closed, we were able to get a lorry in which I could leave for Zahidan. I took the permission of Vice Consul, Zabul before leavir^ Birjand. He had arrived there on the 2nd September. It was commonly believed that the roads were in danger and that communications between Meshed and Teheran were also not free from danger. News about the escape of Raza afesh to Ispahan were* also current in Birjand and when the public came to know about the bombardment of Teheran, they said ’•That is good 1 This is a deservir^ retribution for the cruelty and injustice done to the Iranian subjects.” 29. When I left Birjand, there was also an Italian with me who had fled from Meshed. Before that he was at Ahwaz from where he had fled at the time of the British invasion. He paid Rs.125/- for a seat which could be obtained for Rs.4/- before the war. Nowadays everythirg is dear in Iran and the poor have to face enormous difficulties. This Italian is an Ergineer in Iran and before coming to Iran he was representing Italy as a military officer in Abyssinia. He also owns a huge building in Meshed. On my enquiring about his proposed destinat ion he said that he would try to go to India. On hearirg this an Iranian told him that it waa very likely that he would be arrested by the Indian Police. He replied '•Even if I am arrested, I would prefer British prison to a Russian one.11 - If the Russians catch hold of me they won r t leave me alive, or if they do, they would subject me to all kinds of tortures'. 7/e had also with us two Iranian officers who used to talk to the Italian when alone, and when I or my Sikh companion used to go near him, they would intently gaze at us and stop their conversation. (It was also heard at Bir jand Ahat plunder and pillage had started on the roads. Simply on the basis of this inform ation we could not leave Harmak for Zahidan that night. Ihere is also a small Iranian force there.) 30. I reached Zahidan on the 4th September and stayed at the house of Malik Mohd. Ali. Here I had the occasion of meeting an Afghan named Ghulam Mohd. who is a bitter enemy of the i^liah and is spreading anti-British propaganda there. There is another person named Raza Khan who is a Barbari and a Britishaibject. He too is stated to be anti-British. 31. G-hulam Mohd who is an Afghan subject, said in my presence *1 am anxiously waiting that as soon as the German troops invade India via Iran, I will be the first man to volunteer'. These words he said in English. He is an Engineer there and is carrying on work of repairs of lorries. 32. I also came to know that in that house German Radio was openly listened into, and the general public, so much so that evta some of the Iranian officers, went to that place. London radio broadcasts were laughed at. This is the state of affairs all over Iran and it is therefore very essential that the German Radio should be janmed so that the people may not get the infection. 33. Germans have spread a good deal of their propaganda in Iran and have also widely distributed their literature in that country, with the result that I felt that Iran was nothin short of second Germany. (There /■I 12 (There were 6 Germans in Meshed who, it was stated, were arrested by the Russian Army* So far as I was able to know. 34. I left Zahidan for Mirjawa on the 4th September. To avoid suspicion of the Iranian Police J did not aee the Vice Consul, Zahidan. But I did somehow inform the Consulate about the Italian referred to above. In Zahidan, on the road to Mirjawa, Iranians have also dug a 6 miles long trench which they call 'Khatt-i-Dafai Iran* (Line of Iranian Defence). Its depth is equal to the height of a man. This shows that they were prepared for a fight with India much earlier. Military strength in Zahidan must be less than 2000 but it is more in Khwash where it is estimated at about 14-15,000. 35. At Mirjawa I met two Afghan Muslims who had come with official of that place, named Aghai Noori. I came to know from these Afghans that they heard Aghai Noori say 'If Iran were attacked either by Russians or English, Iranians would have certainly opposed but now it is difficult to oppose the combined Armies. Even now we are anxiously waitir^ for the Germans to come to our rescue. It is only then that we would give a befittir^ answer to this attack. It has been proved beyond doubt that Iranian youth were in hoped of German and Turkish help, but this help did not arrive in time. This help was either refused deliberately or due to some special designs. The fact remains that this had damped the courage of Iranians. 36. I reached Nokkundi on the 6 th September and left for Quetta the same day by train. There was also one Pole in the train whom I saw with the Germans at Turbat-i-Haidari, and I took him for a German. This man has escaped to India; nothir^ is known about the others who may either have escaped to Afghanistan or may be hiding themselves in some distant aubrubs of Iran. I informed Mr .Sethi and Mr. P.J.Keene, some important documents were also recovered from them.) 'the idea of going to Meshed. They were known to a Customs Intelligence/-t6&gt;&amp; -13- Irrtelligence Officers in Quetta, that I had seen that Pole at Turbat-i-Haidari# 37. I had also heard at Zahidan that the Russian Army had advanced up to Birjand and had also established a centre of air activities at Oonabad. 38. I also learnt from the Izuiiu Iranians that Mufti Ahzam, Palestine and Rashid Ali Oilani were in Teheran and that hundreds of German secret agents were hati hiding themselves in the Iranian hills, whom it was difficult to trace and who are anxiously waitir^ for the German Army. 39. A brief statement by me was broadcast from Delhi on the 9th September and was published in the Indian newspapers on the 10th and 11th September in which I stated that the English and the Russians have saved India from a grave danger by taking these steps.

I have the honour to Invite your attention to the following observations on the question of propaganda a.iong the Shi 1 a communities of Ne^ef and Kerbela with special reference to its effect in Iran. 0. Tn view of the widespread dislike with which Great Britain is regarded in Iran and the sympathy felt towards Germany, it would seem worth while to ma^e some effort to influence the population in our favour through the religious classes. Although it has been the Shah 1 ® settled policy to break their power, this section of the population is still regarded with respect, and Shi*a tradition is still strong. Further there is a tendency to arrive at some kind of compromise between Islam and modernism. 3. There is little opportunity in view of present conditions in Iran of approaching the religious classes directly or of making an appeal to the people through the medium of Ghi f a tradition, but this could perhaps be done through the Shi'a communities of Nejef and Kerbela. There has been, admittedly, a considerable decrease in pilgrim traffic between Iran and Iraq. A propaganda campaign in Nejef and Kerbela would eventually filter through to Iran, and such an infiltration could be expedited by arranging visits of Muslims from Kerbela and Nejef to Iran. This would not involve great difficulty, for there are a considerable number of mu.jtahidin of Persian extraction. 4. It may be that direct approach to the nujtahidin by the British authorities in Iraq would be difficult and unlikely to be successful. An alternative method of starting such a propaganda campaign would seem to be by sending some prominent Muslim* from outside Iraq to visit Nejef and Kerbela. It would be desirable for him to spend some time in those cities, to entertain the rau. 1 tahidin liberally and meanwhile to spread propaganda among them. In this connection I would mention a proposal made by the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Baghdad for an exchange of visits of prominent Muslims between India and Iraq (see despatch No. D.3740-N/40 of 16th July to Sir Basil Newton and the latter’s renly No. 33/47/40 of 89th August). 5. As regards the type of Muslim to be chosen for such a task, it seems essential that he should be a man of_some standing in the Muslim world, e.g., a man of the 'NaWab' type and not for example merely an iiuUtH ordinary Indian official who would carry little weight. He should also be a lan of modern outlook. India would seem the obvious place to select such an individual, but n» Bight Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.G.I., O.C.I.B., etc., etc., etc., FOREIGN OFFICE. CF/:but it may be that some prominent Muslim, prepared to undertake such a task, could be found elsewhere. In some ways this might be preferable. 6 . If the mujtahidln could be convinced that their true interests lay in supporting the Allies and that Germany was an enemy of civilisation, or induced to make pronouncements on these lines, it it would be ideal, and such pronounce ents would naturally carry more weight than if it was thought the mu jtahidin ?/ere being 'bought'. It is unlikely that such disinterestedness will be found. There is little doubt, hoY/ever, that a judicious distribut ion of largesse would achieve the desired results. 7. The type of propaganda which would be suitable for use through these channels in so far as Iran is concerned is as follows: material on the general results at stake in the war and the reasons for the war, German disregard of the rights of other nations, her ultimate aim of world conquest, and the anti-religious nature of the German regime coupled with emphasis on British strength and certainty of ultimate victory.

Your Excellency, Reference correspondence ending with the letter from the Government of India in the External Affairs Department No. F. 437-N/40, dated the 17th June 1940. 2 . on a conversation with Khan Sahib Tahir Hussain Qureehi, Ills Majesty’s Vice Consul at Baghdad. The Government of India have noted in particular the remarks of the Khan Gahib to the effect that (a) the exchange of visits between pilgrims from India to Iraq and religious leaders from Iraq to India can obviously form a most effective channel of propaganda against Great Britain and (b) that the Indian Congress have been doing a certain amount of propaganda in the Holy Cities through students from the United Provinces and through Indian merchants and that to some extent they may be financing these merchants. G. In the light of the above the Government of India have been considering whether by judicious propaganda, possibly assisted by some expenditure, it might not be possible to use Indian pilgrims to Iraq or possibly Iraqi as religious leaders who visit Indiajd a channel of pro-British propaganda and would be grateful for Your Excellerjcy * s views on this suggestion. Copies of this letter and its enclosui^are being sent to the Secretary of State for India and His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. I have the honour to be? Your Excellency's most obedient servant, Sd/- W.

Hay, for Secretary to the Government of I r diu. .J • - * S,J% RiiPORT on conversation with Khan Sahib Saiyid Tal: ir Qureshi, Vice-Consul at His Majesty’s Consulate, iBa^ ir iv Baghdad* ; '940 J . On June 11th and 12th I had two very interesting talks with Khan Sahib Sajfcyid Tahir Hussain Qureshi and he was able to give me his views and impressions of the present political situation in Iraq* In addition he gave me notes on various tendencies and activites of Indian Shias domiciled in or on pilgrimage to Iraq, which provide an interesting background in studying the present arix attitude of the Shias both to the British Government and the Iraqi Government* In tracing the development of political tendencies and activities among the Indian Shias he goes back to the days of the Turkish Regime, when the treatment meted out by the British Consul General to the Indians in Iraq was the envy of all Iraqis* rthen Iraq came under British occupation, naturally no discrimination could be made between the Shias of India and Iraq, and both were treated alike. However, about this time other influences began to be felt, and the Iraqi Religious Heads, who were opposed to non-Muslim Rule, began to stir up trouble among the Arabs. The unrest was increased among Shias, both in Iraq and in India, by such stories as the bombing of the Kufa Mosque etc* , but the excitement died down on the expectation of the formation of a national Muslim Government in Iraq* In the new Cabinet the se&amp;ts for Sunnis and Shias were allotted accord ing to population, and the Shias found themselves in a considera- ole minority, blame for this being largely placed on the British Government. About this time rumours were spread about the demolishing of tombs in Saudi Arabia, and here again the British Government was brought into disrepute for not interfering in a question which affected the religious feelings of their Shia subjects. This common grievance intensified the bond of union between Indian and Iraqi bhias against the British Government. The apqci attitude of the domiciled and pilgrim Indian Shias towards the Iraqi Government in recent years is largely influenced by certain laws, such as the Residence Laws, conscription, Nationality and Labour Laws* These laws react, not only legally, against ti e Indian Shia, but also to a great extent from the somewhat arbitrary method of their application. Pilgrims come unaer the residence Law, and on first entry into the countiy are. subject to a certain amount of unnecessazy trouble by the Police in the examination of their credentials, involving frequent attendance of themselves and their women folk at the olice Station* Not only do these laws create bad blood between the Indian Shias, and the Iraqi Shias, and tue Iraqi Government, but there seems little doubt that it is felt, or the rumour is spread, that these laws have been suggested to the Iraqi Govern ment by the British Government* On the subject of the relations of Indian Shias domiciled in Iraq with their co-religionists in India the Vice-Consul pointed out that the Iraqi Shias receive a considerable amount of money from Indian Shias, and in return represent them in reciting addresses, conducting prayers for the deceased relations, maintaining ancesti'al tombs, and in obtaining verdicts from the priests in Iraq. Many Iraqi and Indian Shias visit India to collect charities and attracted by the religious toleration of the country* Some of these visitors are reciters of elegies, others are religious lecturers, and are generally treated with considerable respect ....respect by the Indian Shias. pilgrims from India to Iraq and religious leaders from Iraq to India, can obviously form a most effective channel for propa ganda against Great Britain, and brings into prominence the importance of the attitude of the iihia population in Iraq. On the other hand, I understand that among the Iraqi Shias there is strong appreciation of the religious toleration of British rule, a fact which, if properly used, should do much to lead Muslims in India and elsewhere to a true appreciation of one of the great facts of British £ rule. Relations between the Iraqi Government and Iranian Shias are said to be strained, owing partly to stonfes of the demolishing of a portion of a mosque in Karbala, and on the other hand difficulties in obtaining visas for Iran, restrictions on the export of money from Iran and consequent loss to the Holy Cities, and interference with religious liberties, have embittered the Iraqi Shias against the Iranian Government. ^&gt;/KtRh;SS t In recent years Congress have been doing a certain amount of propaganda in the Holy Cities through students from the U.P,, and through Indian merchants in Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, etc. The merchants may be financed to some extent by Congress and some of them are used as distributing centres for literature. The Chief Congress follower is said to be Kai Saheb G.S, Varma, a merchant in Baghdad, who was visited by Nehru when the latter was in Baghdad. Another important Congress agent was A.M.K.Sagar, an Indian Irom x ; oona, and strongly pro-German, who was recently deported from Iraq. He was very friendly with Gant Bingh Talwar, a Punjabi Bikh, who was trained as a pilot in England and is still in Baghdad in some b siness firm. Another close friend of Sagar's was Puranich, from Poona, Secretary of the Indian Association and a clerk in Andrew Weir &amp; Co., Baghdad. M USLIM LEAGUE S There has idtla lately been a certain amount of propaganda by the Muslim League against the Congress. Rashid, Secretary of the League in Baghdad, who works under Sir Abdulla Haroon, is said to be a w nonentity. MUFTI OF JERUSALEM . He is said to be well guarded and watched by the C.I.B. Hasrat Mohani and azad Subhani both visited kix him separately when in Iraq, the interview being arranged by Abdul A z iz :uassab, ex-Minister of the Interior. (If thought desirable a still closer watcn could be arranged secretly, but this would necessitate provision of funds). KHAKS.xRB « Very little is heard of the Ahaksars in Iraq. It is said that Allama Mashriqi met Nuri Pasha (Foreign Minister) once when on Ha.i . national Islamic party (green shirts) and istiblalists. The Vice-Consul knew nothing of either of these parties and I have promised to pass on to him such information as we possess about them. FOREIGN ANTI-BRITISH INFLUENCE . In the opinion of the Vice- Consul the greatest influence in foreign propaganda has been Dr. Grobba, who is suspected by some to have been connected with Yunus Bahri in the murder of Mr. Monde Mason. While Dr. Grobha was in Iraq he worked unceasingly among the students, arranging to send selected candidates to Berlin for education. He undoubtedly still has his close contracts in Iraq and continues to conduct his propaganda from Irun* The ....— n 'y— - 3 - men f r n 1 ■$ ^ W 2 v.&gt; tioned as The following three persons are specially being undesirables, No. (1) being suspected strongly of working with Grobba i- _ (1) Sheikh Ali Sharqui, President, Shara Appellate Court, in Baghdad. It is rumoured that he receives £50 per month from XBk Grobba and may be a link in the chain between Germany and Iraq and Iran. (2) Sheikh Mohd. Hussain Kash-al-Ghata. An ardent political agitator, being particularly interested in Palestine. His mode of living leads to the suspicion that he receives more money than he earns honestly. He lives in Nejaf and is visited by many Indian students. He v/as refused a visa by the Iraq Govern- ornt. (3) Mohd. Mehdi (British subject) s/o M. Kalbe Baquir, is a bom intriguer. His father c^me from Lucknow and he has many relatives there and in India, one being the Government advocate Kalbe ^bous of Rae Bereli. Mohd. Mehdi was bom in Iraq of a Arab mother. He is very anti-British, and a dangerous man and I understand his removal from Iraq would be much appreciated. His brother Abdul Mehdi (by a Persian mother) is strongly pro-3ritish. There is a great deal of pro-German and pro-Italian propaganda in the chief towns. Taken as a whole the Russians are disliked as being anti-religio us• I IAN . In Iran the upper classes appeared to be anti-Russian, but owing to general oppression and heavy taxation the lower classes formed a very fertile ground for Bolshevik propaganda and the Soviet are exploiting this advantage to the full. There appeared to be much Russian propaganda among the Sikh motor drivers in Teheran, of wj&amp;om there is a considerable number. Narain Singh of Teneran is particularly suspected of being a Soviet agent. He made a special point of seeding the Vice-Consul when in Teheran, and asked him if he thought Great Britain would safeguard Iran from invasion by Russia*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000396_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/418</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000396</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/418</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 5013/40 'Propaganda among Shi'ite communities in Iraq and Persia'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1940/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-04-06T10:32:21</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (96 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 98; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This volume consists of letters, telegrams and memoranda relating to reports on propaganda among Shi'ite communities in Iraq and Persia.The file includes correspondence on the visit of the Nawab of Bahawalpur (Maulvi Mohamed Bashir and the report of his visit on propaganda among Shi'ite communities in Iraq (ff 30-41) and Persia (ff 42-49).Included in the file (ff 94-96) is the report on the conversation with Khan Sahib Saiyid Tahir Hussain Qureshi by the Vice-Consul at HM Consulate, Baghdad.Principal correspondents are HM Ambassador, Baghdad, and HM Ambassador, Tehran.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000396#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
