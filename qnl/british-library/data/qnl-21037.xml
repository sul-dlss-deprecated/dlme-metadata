AIR STAFF ISTELLISEHOE, AIR HMDQUARTEIB, BAGHDAD. D,D t O/l96. 23rd t December 192fi. To Major O.K. Daly O.I.E., Political Agent. BAHREIN. i ihere is a proposal under consideration, if it should be politically and topographically possible, to establish a subsidiary air route to India via the Arabian coast and Muscat, and thence across the sea to British Baluchistan. This would provide an alternative route for ieinforcement by air in the event of political factors render ing use of the Persian coast route impracticable. Before the matter is taken up officially by the Air Officer Oommanding, it would save much time if you could kindly send us preliminary notes unofficially, by the first available mail on the following points:- Topographical possibility of establishing landing grounds and refuelling stations at Kuwait, Khaburah and Muscat, with intermediate landing and refuelling grounds in the vicinity of the Musallamiyah Islands and Mirfah. As far as possible, the distance between refuelling grounds should not exceed 250 miles, and distance flown over sea should not be greater than 30 miles at a stretch. ^ The practicability of establishing tanks and stores with the necessary guards, tribal or otherwise, at these refuelling grounds, including a rough estimate of the numbers 01 such guards necessary to security and their approximate cost. ^ As an alternative to (2), temporary establish ment of such refuelling grounds from H.M. ships as and whend) required. (4) The provision of intermediate emergency landing grounds at about 20 to 50 miles inter^l from Kuwait to Muscat inclusive, to include at least one with water on the route across the Oman Peninsular 'between Mirfah and Ehaburah. (5) Opinion on the practical degree of security of such refuelling grounds and emergency landing grounds, and of personnel and machines landing along the route. (6) Political aspect of the establishment of such refuel ling and emergency landing grounds and of the question of flying over foreign territories concerned. Best methods of approaching these questions and surmounting possible difficulties involved. You will understand that all that is required at present is a preliminary note from information at your disposal in order to gather a general idea as to whether the preposition is practicable and if so, to provide the material for inaugurat ing it officially on the right lines. Oopies of this letter are being sent to Major More, Major Daly and Major Barrett, at Kuwait, Bahrein and Muscat respectively. ^en the matter is taken up officially in conjunction with India, one of the first steps will probably be the arrange ment at as early a date as is possible, of a reconnaissance of possible landing grounds in co-operation with the Navy. Would you also advise on the necessary preliminaries before despatching such a reconnaissance and as to whether the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf or the Government of India be addressed in the first instance. We should be most grateful for any assistance you can give us and feel confident from your great helpfulness in the past, that you will do all you can for us* The matter should be treated as ^SORET 1 .

Air Officer Commanding wishes to carry out in February reconnaissance of subsidiary air route to India via Arabian coast of Persian Gulf, reconnaissance to include flying over territory of Chiefs concerned and landing from H.M's. Ships to examine potential landing grounds. Jesirable that distance flown over sea should not exceed 30 miles at a stretch, and that there should be refuelling grounds at maximum intervals of 250 miles and emergency landing groungs at intervals of 20 to 50 miles. Cooperation of Arab leaders from Kuwait to Muscat will be necessary and I suggest that H.M.Government should approach Ibn Saud direct and that Resident, Bushire. should communicate with others. Communication from Ibn Saud referred to in Bushire telegram No. 35 of 1 2th July 1924 makes it certain that Ibn Saud would strongly object to reconnaissance over his territory without his previous permission. HIGH COHMISSIOHER. Telegram From To Repeated Bated andHo. C. IS' /7/4 of 1927. , Political Agency Bahrein. Date tiie loth January 1^7. To The Secretary to the Hon*bit the Poiiticai Resident, Persian Gulf, BUSHIBB. Memorandum. Reference your Uo.e~Q. of loth January 1927. Shaikh Hamad would welcome a visit to Bahrein 1'rom aero planes and the political effect would be good. I do not anticipate any objection from Shaikh ^bdulla ibn Jassim Al Thani to aeroplanes flying over his territories. I consider that such a visit should have a good political effect. If the previous permieeion of Bin Saud be obtained there should be no objection to visits to the Mussalama islands, Qatif and Ojair, as the inhabitants apfjear to be absolutely obedient to his orders. So far as I can ascert ain landings could be effected at all the places mentioned. The Mussalama islands are inhabited by the £ vhl Khalid and Ahl Sabah during the winter. The majority of these inhabitants are said to return to ^atif in the Summer. They are said to be secretly opposed to Bin Saud but are so greatly impressed by his power that the, would not dare to act contrary to his wishes. There are four wel3s on the island and as far as I can ascertain the ground is flat and sandy. Ciatif has a fringe of date palms on the sea shore, about hall a mile to three miles wide. Landings can be effected behind this fringe, as the soil appeara to be hard sand. landing place for aeroplanes was prepared by iaa^or 1m.1v vphrn ao-o in t.hp northnrn half of Bahrpin inlynhrf CONFI-Dr UTIAL.but i* is in need of attention. I request that timely inforiaation niay be given to me before aeropianes visit tbe island, so that I may have it put into proper order. Aeroplanes would normally fly from Bahrein to Zunara on the west coast of (Jatar and thence to Shaqiq and Dohah and down the coast to IfekeaK on the way to Abu Lhabi. I have not been able to get much information about i^atar. but from what I can gather the land is flat and stony ana the water supply scanty and of poor quality. Shaqiq possesses a well of good water and water can be obtained at Dohah and WaJcfat which though of indifferent quality would at a pinch n suffice for the needs of a reconoitring party. \ I have not myself visited any of the places in this * area outside the Bahrein islands and it is difficult to obtain information regarding landing grounds etc without giving rise to undesirable curidsity. I think it should be possible for aeroplanes to land but I strongly recormend that a preliminary ground reconnaissance should be made, if possible, by myself att4 some officer deputed from Iraq, or if this ue impractic able by a trustworthy Arab, before an aeroplane reconnaissance is undertaken. /t '£7 Political A^ent, Bahrein. fti/t® 7/, SECRliiT. D.O. Political Agency, Bahrein Bated the 17th January 1927, JltiU In reply to your D. dated the 23rd December. I am afraid my information about the neighbouring mainland is very scanty as I have never visited it and there is very little information on the Office files. Ihe iiussalama islands appear to be low and sandy with four good wells. They are inhabited by the Bani Khalid and Bani Sabah, who are both secretly opposed to Bin Saud who claims everlordsnip but aa they are thoroughly cowed, any arrangements made with the Sultan of Kejd woulo be carried out on the isianas without difficulty. Qatil the next halting place is well in Bin Baud's grip and it he gave pemission for a rooaa-t aeroplane no dilficulty ©f any sort need be ariticipated • The same applies to Ojair which the jkir Force might like to use as a jumping off ground for Bahrein. The sea coast near ^atif is fringed \&gt;j a belt of palm trees varying from half to fourteen miles in width, and it is 14 miles in legtiu The land immediately inland of the palm trees appears to be fit for aeroplane landings though it soon changes into sandy desert. The sandy desert comes right down to the sea at Uqair• Daly made an aerodrome at Bahrein about 4 yeasr ago, and although it is in a very neglected condition I could soon have it ready for use if you gave me timely warning ©f the approach of aeroplanes. From Bahrein a sea crossing of roughly 18 miles brings one to Zubara in i ^atar where the Shaikns of Bahrein used to have their headquarters. It is now practically uninhabited, but I do net think there should be much difficulty Col.lS.Dent,C.B.i;.,D.S.O., about Baghdad.about arranging for a landing ground and guards. The route from here would be to Dohah Tia Shaqiq and thence to Wakrah, alter which it passes out of my political jurisdiction into that of the Secretary to the Hon'Me the Political Resident, Bushire. The whole of Qatar is described as low lying roclcy and pebbly desert, so a certain amount of Work i»\ preparing aerodromes would probably be necessary. Shaqiq possesses a very good well, but the water at Cohah, the capital of Qatar, and at Wakrah is of poor quality. The whole of Qatar is under the jurisdiction of ShaiJch Abdullah bin Jassim a1 Thani, whose word carries weight at Dohah cind . akrah. I think independent arrangements with local tribes would have to be made for protection at Zubara and Shaqiq, as Abdullah is represented to me as more of a pearl merchant t.h an a Shaikh • I think that before aeroplanes visit this area a ground reconnaissance and report on possible landing grounds is most necessary. I will. With pleasure, undertake any enquiries that may be necessary. / 7 2^ p.s. I attach the few notes desired 'by you© I B The following are the average maximum and minimum ground temperatures for Bahrein taken from the Persian Gulf Pilot. Ho observations have been kept since the war.

In the 4 months since I came here there was a thick mist on one morning only. There is very occasionally a haze which affects visibility, but I do not consider it heavy enough to affect flying. I have seen nothing that could be described as a dust storm here and only on one day in October was the air filled with dust owing to the continuance throughout 2 days of a strong southerly wind. The mainland is, I think, free from fog but in certain areas sand storms off the desert are probable. The prevailing winds and rain periods at Bahrein are givengraph Department, but there are no ether Telegraphs, Telephones or Wireless along this coast.810RXT. @ D.0.1fo.0.20 Political Kgenoy, Bahrein. i&gt;«ted the IVth January ISte?.

The Ibn Saud question has been referred through - normal diplomatic channels, but the A.O.C. is trying to arrange for a reconnaissance of the eastern portion of the route on the Arabian Coast as soon as possible, which one hopes will be at the end of February or not much later / if all-goes well. Should this eventuate, who ever carries out the reconnaissance Y^ill be certain to visit you on route. If you can do something to supplement the informa tion you sent to.us in the meantime, we shall be most grateful. Thank you also for the meteorological - notes. How are you getting along these days and have you anything further in view, or is it p . case of contemplating retirement and the west in a few years time'? It is a long time since we met. With further thanks and wishing you the best of luck, Yours sincerely,© D.O. C 4^ Political Ageacy # Bakreia, 15tja March 1927. Please refer to tkc D/0 correnpojideaoe ending with your D•D.O.32 of 3rci February 1927. I do not think the preseat landing ground for aeroplanes suitable for that purpose*. It is far removed from and the area is over growa with tufts of grass. I have accordingly had a atw wkgett marked out, much nearer the agency. Its position is shown on the accompanying map of Bahrein Island. I am also sending you a large scale plan show- -ing neighbouring gardens and buildings. The road shown as crossing the ground is not an obstacle in an., way. The ground is flat and such small traffic as passes near the area of the landing ground can easily be diverted. The area shov^n as C^AS a IBIA and -luliLfcABAD villages consists of ffftat huts mostly unoccupied during the winter. The best guide for an aeroplane would be Sheikh Hamad's new palace which has a dome at its northern end, and when occupied would fly a red flag.

At Dahal It will he a matter of difficulty to sooure acooffifflodatlon ashore, hut our .Residency Agent for the Truclal Coast could arrange to put the party up at Shargah, which Is within sight ol Dahal ( 8 miles away) and his headquarters. The Residency Agent lias a motor oar and a sea going motor heat whloh would he available for the party to come Into Bahal as they required. (c). As cohah and as el Khalmah are hoth rather fanatical places the Hon'hie the Political Resident considers the only practical and safe course ®ould he for the party to reside on hoard one of H.' 's. sloops which could he asked to work In conjunction with the reconnaissance party from Do hah ('4a tar, alongalong the fruoial Coast to &lt;as el Xhaloab, being at the various places desired on certain dates. 11 • I' etrol and oil. (a). It should ha possihle to store these at Abu Dhabi and las el Khaiaah, provided the Mesopotam- -ia Persia Corporation will arrange onward deepatoh iroffi Babai by dhow, as I understand you they can. The Kesiaency Agent will be able to find storage accommodation at each place, but ample time should be given this office, so that all details jaay be arranged with the Residency Agent beforehand. (b). As regards Dohah (tjatar) the Mesopotamia 'itftia orporatlon would probably prefer to send petrol and oil from Bahrain by dhow, as being more convenient. Here again, as the Jolitical Agent at Bahrain would have the arranging of all details with the Buler of Qatar, early notice of your final pr.o- -graame and dates would be required by us. (c). Should by chance the Shaikh of Qatar raise objection to your stores being landed, which is un- -likely, you would have the warship in attendance to fall back upon. The Senior Haval officer would psobably raise no objection to oil and petrol being stored on one of his ships provided qusntitias were reasonable ami he was warned beforehand. III. in conclusion I am to say that when your dates for the recoMaissance are fixed it would be of great assist -anoe if you could send an officer to rots hire to discuss details. he chief person concerned, the '-esidenoy Agent, ihargah, could also be called here at the sane tlae.

I was instructed by Air Commodore Bowhill (Chief Staff Officer) to get moorings ready for Bahrein which I have done and 1 sent all details to Air Headquarters some fortnight ago in order that they might communicate with you. I received a signal today ordering me to send these moorings down in the Slow Mail and I am sending an K.C.O. down with them. I have given him his instructions but you will of course understand that they are given subject to your approval, and dependant on the local conditions which might prevail. The flying Boats left England yesterday the 28th. February, and should be here in the middle of the month. I hope that one of our first trips will be to Bahrein and that we shall be able to take you down the coast to visit the places mentioned to me while I was staying with you. Yours Sincerely,SECRBT. ho. 97-S. of 1929. British KefiideriGy md Consulate-General, Bushire, 2nd April 1929. The Air Officer Commanding, Air Headquarters, Iraq. Command, Baghdad. Memorandum .

Ko objection exists at the present time to direct flights to Kuwait and Bahrain provided the consent of the f'haikh concerned is previously obtained through the Political Agent. 3. As regards Has al Khaima: no arrangements have as yet been concluded with the Rhaikh and no visits should be paid and no buoying and other arrangements can be made until the agreement of the Bhailch has been obtained. 4. HenJ am and Bushire are in Persian territory and cannot be visited without the special permission of the Persian Government which has to be obtained through His Majesty's Minister in ^ehran. I shall be glad to see fing Commander Howe at any time but he will, I think, have difficulty in coming to Bushire. I expect to be at Abadan and neighbourhood from the 3rd to the 15th April with Mr Elkington of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Could Wing Commander Howe arrange to meet me there^ I shall be glad to discuss matters with him. In any case X would suggest that he should take an early opportunity of meeting Lieutenant-Colonel C.

Bubject: Flights down Persian Gulf 'by Flying Boats of No.203 (Flying Boat) Qquadron^ 1. Three 'Southamptom' Flying Boats of the above Squadron have now arrived as Basrah and are ready to carry out flights down the ffulf as soon as the necessary arrangements for their reception at various places can be arranged. 2. It is proposed that the first flights to be under taken will be to Bail rain. Moorings and fuel are already available there and arrangements havebeen made for more fuel to be sent. t 3. It is important to establish if possible moorings and a fuel supply at Has al Khaimah. In order to do this it is proposed^, as soon as the arrangements at Bahrain have proved suitable, to fly from Bahrain to Henjam and carry out a reconnaissance from there to Has al Khaimah. 4. At present there are four mooring buoys with sinke^ at Henjam one of which is laid. It is proposed to move the other three to Has al Khaimah. Eventually it is desirable to establish a fuel supply of 3000 gallons aviatic^ mixture and 200 gallons of oil at this place. I should be grateful for any advice you can give in this connection. 5 # As far as possible the flights will keep to the Arabian Coast in order to avoid any trouble with the Persian authorities. At the sjime time it would be a good thing if the boats could visit Bushire to give the Commanding Officer, Wing Commander T.K.B. Howe, A.F.C., an opportunity of calling on you, and discussing future plans if*you agree. 6. With regard to the general arrangements for the flight we will give you ample warning by cypher signal of ou: proposals. After you have replied to this we will keep you informed en clair of the actual movements.Ho. of 1347 Office of me AQYiser to the GoTernment, Bahrain. Dated, 1st -Uil Qad 1347 To E. B.

Sir I have the honour to submit a report on i^y trip to Abu Dhabi and Has el iOmima for the information of the Hon # ble the Resident# 2. The Southampton flying boat arrived on Monday the I7th JUne in record time, having accompliahed the trip from Basra to Bahrein in 2 hours and 55 minutes, aided by a strong wind. Th^ boat was commnded by Wing Com^nder Howe, with Flight Lt. Oandy and P/0 Southey as pilots. The crew consisted of a fitter and a wireless operator# 3. The 18th opened very misty, and though the wind and the weather reports were favourable ( we were in tough with Hlffi I«Pin ) the officers were unable to make up their mind whether to proceed or not. Eventually at 9 a.m. we started with the in tention of returning from qatar if the mist was found to be e- qually heavy there. We reached the peninsula* in a quarter of an hour, having a very strong wind behind us, but after proceed ing a short way ting Commnder Howe decided to return. As we found the next day, when conditions were worse, this was a mis- . take as conditions improved directly the jatar peninsula was left 4. we again set out on the iStt 1 th, after witing to see conditions *ould improve. They got worse, so we decided to We without waiting and so* reaped Bohah. From here on the plst beg..,.i to lift and the wind to die down, but after leaving akr ,h some * error occurred which shows how far aerial n&amp;viga-tlon is fron being an exact science* The pilot on the 1o&amp;cout, F/L Gandy, had pa sed back a message giving the e xct time of our arrival at Balmh and Yas, a message which surprised me as we had passed no point by which our position could be checked for over half an hour. Shortly after .he time specified, we flew over two islands, but they seewd very small and upon ma- king inquiries it was discovered that they were Karnain and Zirko I It was now d cided to make straight for Abu Dhabi, which we reached at I p#m. after some 4$ ho rs flying* 5# I disembarked with the ing Commander, and having no tiui time to waste set out for the fornt, sending a mn on ah&amp;ad to announce our arrival# Shortly after ray arrival, ( we were shown to a shaded spot at the sMe of the formt weher a carpet had been spread ) Shaikh Bhakhboot arrived with several relation and apologised for not having been ready earlier, but that he had been aileep, and had not known of my visit. He was friendly and expressed a desire to see the plane, and on our return he rowed out to the plane, but only had time for a very cursory glance* He took some time to find a boat to come out in and we preceded him finding the crew of the plane to fully occupied from preventing the greater part of Abu Dhabi from se»wrming over the machine. A boat carrying out some of his relations capsized but all swam to shore. 6« It appears that this is the first time a plane has been to Abu Dhabi, and our reception was excellent. We were parti- culary requested to fly round the town low down on our departure so that all might have a good look at the machine. Incidental ly there was a little difficulty in getting off the water. fttiat impressed the local ir^abitante most war that we proposed to get to Ras-e1~Khaimah in two hours, and not the fact that we had we had come from Bahrein in 4^*. As I have said above, nothing was known of sjy impending visit, which was a pity. 7* ?e arrived at Ras-el-Khaimah punctually at 5 p.m. and the Residency Agent came ofx at once. I disembarked, and half an ho r later received the Shaikh. He was a little # dt±tm±±e• difficile ♦ and had little to I sent for the Wing Conana der and introduced him. We arranged to return his iriait after dark, ae there waa no time to spare the next day, and were receiTed at his raejlis outside his fort* He became much more affable, and finally became quite friendly, and insisted on returning to the water 's edge with me, chatting the whole way. He asiced me my age, and the number of my children. He was very surprised to find that I apparently had no children and was not married and inquired the reason. I explained that out religion allowing ua a less generous quota than Islam, it behored us to kxkx be more circumspect in taking a step so unique and permanei 8. The Khan dahadur adijylsed that the ap re petrol should be kept on the dhow in the lagoon, as it will be required for Sir Geoffrey M Galmond's flight to India at the end of July. He said that its return to Shargah would be misinterpreted by the local Arabs, and as the extra cost was alight wing Comman der Howe readily agreed to thla. I Informed the Ke^sldency Agent of the Impending vlalt of the Political Resident, and he said that he would no doubt go into the matter of a storage plac place then. J. ''oxt morning after an early start, we flew to Ota-el- Qaiwain and taxied about the lagoon. The Residency Agent had told me that aome family quarrel war ins progress so that we decided not to land, nor as a matter of fact waa there time to do so. Our visit here was not without its humorous side, nota bly when we went aground, quite unnecessarily, and again when the pilot opened up to leave the water with the fitter sitting outside on the back plane 1 The look of indignant astonishment on his face and hie rapid descent into the after hatch were well worth weeing. 10. ing Commander Howe was much impressed with the ad vantages of •im-sl-qaiwain as a seaplane base, and considers it .uuch perior, tkxto Has el Shaimaft, the only advantage at the latter place being the preaence of the R.A. for a prt of the yea*.

By Order for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Botes by the Air Staff on the regulation of Air Control in undeveloped countries. Copy No. 121| This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Gov ernment. SECRET, 121 NOTES BY THE AIR STAFF ON THE REGULATION OF AIR CONTROL IN UNDEVELOPED COUNTRIES, THE use of Air Power as an instrument for the control of semi-civilized countries is still a recent development, and it is important that all who are in one way or another concerned with its regulation should fully understand the methods by which it operates. The following notes describe the cardinal points of the regulation of this form of control. 1. Moral effect of Air 'power. It is a generally accepted axiom that the air arm achieves its chief results through the moral effect it produces on the enemy, and when employed in backward countries there is the favourable factor that the enemy has little or no air resources with which to counter our action. This enhances the moral effect on the inhabitants, who are confronted with a weapon against which they cannot retaliate. 2. Necessity for co-operation between the Air Force Commander and the local Political Authorities. The proper employment of air power is essentially dependent on the most intimate co-operation between the Air Force Commander and the local political authority. If air operations are to be successful, it is vital that all concerned with their conduct, whether civilian administrators or officers of the fighting services, should realise that success is dependent on the effect produced on the enemy morale. To obtain this moral effect, air forces do not require to get to grips with the enemy, nor do they produce tangible and visible results, such as prisoners of war, casualties to our own personnel and definite advances into the enemy's country. During active air operations there are few of the recognised signs of warfare; there are no long columns, no marching and counter-marching, no Red Cross ambulances, and none of the so-called panoply of war. Consequently, those who in the past have only been accustomed to fighting on the ground, where nothing can be achieved without gaining actual physical contact with the enemy and defeating him in battle, are not always able to appreciate the effect that air action produces on the enemy's morale and mentality. In land warfare the progress of operations is slow, and it is possible to estimate the result of a particular operation and to foresee the approaching end when one combatant will surrender or ask for an armistice. The political authorities have been able to follow the course of the operations and are well aware when the final scene is set and it is their turn to enter the arena and to conduct the peace negotia tions. In air warfare it is not possible to follow the operations stage by stage, and that is especially the case when the operations are carried out against a semi-civilised enemy, and when it is consequently difficult to judge the moral effect of. air action on his mentality. In this type of warfare it is essential that the Air Officer Commanding and the local political authority should act together and maintain the closest touch, so that the Commanding Officer, assisted by the advice of the political officer and by his intimate knowledge of the characteristics of the enemy, can keep his finger on the pulse of the enemy morale and nerves and decide, subject to any overriding political consideration, on the most favourable objectives for attack and can say whether air action should be continued or suspended against former objectives, or whether the bombing should be distributed over a wider area. Unless this close tofich is maintained, the Air Officer Commanding cannot advise when the right moment has arrived for air operations to be temporarily suspended, and for the political authority to endeavour to initiate peace negotiations. The air arm is a delicate weapon which is easily blunted if misused, either by wielding it too early or too late, and especially too much. How, where, when and in what degree it is to be employed are questions upon which the Air Officer Commanding on the spot, and he alone, can give authoritative advice with the aid of the local political officer, and by using his experience in estimating the effect of the air operations on the morale and mentality of those against whom the operations are being conducted. [19366]2 Air operations, when carried out against an enemy whose existence is not dependent on a highly organised civilisation, are liable if unduly protracted to creat an attitude of sullen resignation. Consequently, as soon as there is reason to beliet 6 that the morale of the enemy is affected by the interference with his normal mode )f life, then offensive air action should be temporarily suspended. An opportunity i thus created for the enemy formally or informally to indicate whether the operation^ have effected a change in his attitude. If that is the case it should be our policy to take immediate advantages of this change of heart to avoid any unnecessary prolongation of air warfare. Otherwise the next stages in active operations are more difficult since the enemy will probably leave his towns and villages and live in the open or in caves. Air operations then become more difficult to undertake and require a longer time to achieve results. It is not, perhaps, appreciated that the air arm under these conditions exerts pressure on an enemy in very much the same way as diplomacy. The power of the • diplomat and of the air arm alike rest on the fact that the enemy does not know how far we are prepared to go in order to attain our ends; nor does he know what steps we will take to attain them. This close connection between political force and air power entails the necessity for the most intimate co-operation between the political authority and the Air Officer Commanding. 3. The Importance of 11 Intelligence.' Just as early and accurate information based on a sound intelligence organisation I is essential to political authorities to enable them to achieve results, so the Air Officer i Commanding is dependent on his intelligence service if he is to obtain a quick, economical and humane success. When land forces are employed for punitive operations, their movements are probably limited to the speed of a camel, or of a horse or a man. If air forces are employed, moving 20 times faster than the older arms, then it is essential that the speed with which they receive information should be similarly accelerated. To make the fullest use of air power, an enemy or a disturber of the peace living 200 or 300 miles away from an air force, must be made to feel that any act of insurrection or violence will meet with retribution within 12 to 24 hours of its commission. The offender must not be allowed to feel, as he will if land forces are employed, that s punishment will tarry and that he may be able to use the interval to evade it. Even if the case is one in which the Political authority decides that bombing would not be justified, the air arm should still be made use of, to enable the Political authorities to reach the scene of the trouble and to deal with the matter on the spot within a few hours of it arising. If full use is made of air communications to speed up the diplomatic and administrative action, much can be done to obviate the trouble spreading, and a small misdemeanour can be prevented from developing into a rising on a large scale, and this speeding up is dependent upon a fullv organized intelligence system. 4. Necessity for swiftness of decision and action in times both of negotiations and active operations. The essential characteristic of the air arm is rapidity of action; this depends not only upon a quick and accurate Intelligence Service, but also on quick decision to initiate air action. It is of the highest importance once the necessary authority is obtained that the local political officer should come to a prompt decision, in 1 conjunction with the Air Officer Commanding, both on the initiation of air action and on its extension when the situation demands it within the limit of his instructions. 5. Limitations of Air power. The air arm is essentially an offensive weapon and can do little towards defenaing a country if its actions are confined to the tactical defensive. For the success of air operations aircraft must have room for manoeuvre, and so be in a position to locate and attack an enemy some hours before he has reached a position where he can do harm. It is, therefore, important, once it has been decided to initiate air action, not to tie down the aircraft to narrow geographical limits.

As regards (b) I said that I would have the corner points whitewashed, but I certainly never said that I would iceep the aerodrome free from encroachments. As you know, the finding of water near the surface, or at any rate readily accessible to artesian wells, has made property here very valuable, and I do not see how owners can be x revented from developing their pro perty simply because the R.A.F may want to fly over it some day. If you wish me to do so, I will ask the Land Department to try and discover who owns what portions of it, and if much of it is unclaimed mk the Shaikh to give the HJUP the refusal of it. &gt; Or perhaps you think the State ought to provide the R.A.F with a free aerodrome ?

Political Agent . Bahrain•. O/ No 157 of 10th July 1929. [emorandunu With reference to the question of the Landing Ground in Manama, 'he Landing Ground, which was marked out at the request of The Political )fficer about two years ago, is a square whose sides are 1800 feet .mmediately south of The Palace, to the south of Manama town, a At the time that the Landing Ground was marked out nothing was definitely suggested or arranged as to its permancy. The Landing Ground was formerly on a plain on the north of the Rafaa *oad some five miles out of Manama. This situation was thought to be ^ather far away. The present Ending Ground, with the exception of a small area on she east, is the property of the Bahrein Government. There are two plots, narked ' A ' and n B n which overlap into the Landing Ground. One of :hese, ' B ' was originally the property of Shaikh Sulman bin Hamed, the Shaikh's eldest son, the other plot was lately gifted by Shaikh ^amed to Shaikh Sulman. Both plots are now under cultivation and are irrigated Dy an artesian well. The area occupied by the Landing Ground is a valuable property. The soil is particularly good for agricultural purposes and it is possible bo obtain water by sinking wells on any part of the area. The site is lear Manama and adjacent to the suburb of Gazabia. When H.E # Shaikh Hamed granted permission for its use as a Landing Jround he certainly had no idea of presenting the Air Porce with any iefinite or permanent rights over the property. Its demarcation was taken to be in the nature of a temporary arrangement carrying with it 10 rights. I now understand that The Air Force require a permanent Landing Ground of the size of the present one with a clear area around it of 400 yards in each direction. This is impossible in the case of the present site^ as is apparent from the map. Except on the north west corner of the Landing Ground the border is almost adjacent to private property, and on the south there is a hill and some rough ground which makes it unsuitable for landing. Regarding the rights of the Eastern, and General Syndicate. At present, as far as The Bahrain Government is aware, the Syndicate hold an Exploration Licence which permits them to search the surface to a depth of not exceeding 20 feet in any portion of The Shaikh's territories They will presumably in due course apply for theirP?rospecting Licence and finally for a Mining Lease under which The Shaikh has guaranteed that he will grant to them an aggregate area not exceeding 100,000 square acres, divided into not more than three blocks, which shall be selected by the compani^. The situation of these blocks is of course not yet decided. The following extract of Article.l. of the Mining Lease^indicates the Company's rights. H He ( The Shaikh ) also grants to the Company the exclusive right to construct and operate refineries and storage tanks within this area and also the right, but not the exclusive right, to construct, erect and operate pipe lines, refineries and storage tanks, railways wharves and jetties,tramways, roads, buildings, machinery and telegraph apparatus of all kinds in any part of the territory under the control of The Shaikh so far as may be necessary for the purpose of their business. * According to this clause it appears that the Syndicate will haveoave the right to erect buildings etc wherever they may wish within :heir 100,000 square acres, and that area may include the present landing Ground. I offer the following suggestions. When it is definitely known that the Eastern Greneral Syndicate are lesirious of continuing their concession The Shaikh might suggest the .nclusion of a clause providing that the Landing Ground, wherever it may )e located, shall be kept clear from any buildings etc. If The Air Force are satisfied with the present Landing Ground ^s , .t is now, they might approach H.E. Shaikh Hamed on the subject of .easing it to them for a long period of years, stipulating that ±JU the )resent open ground between its boundaries and the villages and mltivation adjoining it should not be built upon or cultivated, within . certain distance from the edge of the Landing Ground. In some Lirections it would allow an area of 200 or 300 yards clear, outside ;he Landing Ground. In other directions the cultivation extends right ip to the Landing Ground. In the matter of leasing this area it should )e remembered that its proximity to Manama makes it a valuable location either for agricultural purposes or for building sites. If this area does not suit The Air Porce another site could doubtles )e chosen, but not within three or four miles of the town. There are luitable places on Muharrak Island, km east of the Tombs on the Rafaa •oad, and also beyond Gedhafs on the Budeya Road, this olain being I ;hink the nearest site to Manama. I am sure that H,E. ShaikhHamed will, until this matter is settled •efrain from putting under cultivation or building upon any more of the ;round adjacent to the aerodrome, and I think he would be willinp* to sonsider the question of leasing the site. Perhaps you are aware that some years ago when Major Dickson was in Bahrain an area north of the present Palace was reserved as a Landing rround and marked by pillars. At that time this action caused a very ;reat deal of public feeling. H.E. Shaikh Hamed reminded me of the fact . few days ago. With reference to the sea plane anchorage , the only liklehood of .nterference with the place which they have chosen would be from the •astern and general Syndicate who have, I believe, ideas of buildinp* a W an ^ wharves in that locality. However until the position of the •yndicate as regards Bahrain is more defined I do not think that this &gt;ossibility need be seriously considered. I do not think that Shaikh Hamed would wish to 1 ..ease the sea : ?om 0 hii e altn iLi S v 1 0f - n0 9?

The Kesidency, iJushire, 10th July 1929. Your J^o. C/85 of 6th July. His Majesty's Government attach great im portance to the development of the Arabian Air Route and I think we should do our very best to help the Royal Air Force in their efforts. They cannot claim exclusive rights in the present aerodrome, and i am sure they will not v/ant to do so when they are; seized of the facts. At the same time i think we shoxild try to get the site for them, or another equally good for their purpose, as cheaply as possible. If the State give a free site so much the better. , It is for Shaikh Hamad to decide. If he np&lt;-i o o J I think he might make a condition, if he considers desirable, that its use should be permitted to civilian aircraft. The Royal Air Force are so keen on Kanoo^ proposal for a subsidiary service to connect with Imperial Airways that they are seriously considering running it themselves if Airways refuse. I have told them they must endeavour to Bhow the Arabs that they give the Captain G. G.

SufbJ ect : Landing Ground and Seaplane Station at Bahraivv t Sir t I have the honour to refer to your letter Ho, 235-S dated the 3rd July and to report as follows. There are two landing grounds at Bahrain, one on the plain south of the Shaikh Ali bridge h+sC north of BIFA t A i and another imnediatelj south of His Bxoellency^ palace• The former, which is 5 miles away from the town t was considered too far off and a second was marked out two years ago, and consists of a plot 1800 feet square• ^ The original landing ground has not been en- -oroached upon hut there have heen certain encroachments on the present landing ground as will appear from the plan which I submit. It will be noticed that there are two plots marked A and B which overlap into it^both of which are under cultivation. These plots are now the property of y Shaikh Solman the •Idoat son of Hie Kxoollenoy Shaikh Hamad, hut the rast ®f tho area enoloaod hy the 1800 feat aquara ia Bahrain Goverumant property. The area covered byToy thia landing ground la excellent for agricultural purposes and now that water can be had anywhere In It by sinking wella it has a considerable value, apart from its value as a potential suburb of Manama. 3, It would be advisable,therefore, if the Boyal Air Force wish to preserve this property in tact for their purposes, for them to hire it, from the Bahrain Government and hire the plots cultivated by Shaikh Sulman in order to complete it if it does not suit them to purchase it out* -right. Such a purchase would in any case be an excellent investment as the land is bound to increase enormously in value. She Bahrain Government would be quite to hire it for a period of years, I feel certain, but it will be seen that It will not be possible to arrange for the 400 yards clear In each direction as desired by the Royal Air J , orce / for gardens have already been built up to the edge in one or two places, though in others there is a space of some 200 - 300 yards. It would have to be stipulated In the lease that the present open ground round the 1800 feet enclosure should not be built on or cultivat -ed, and this would no doubt add slightly to its price. //. It should be noted that in demarcating area and also the former landing ground the Bahrain Government did not consider that they were conveying to the Royal Air Foree any title to the land nor ae a matter of fact have they done so. If it is considered that this site is un- -suitable, no doubt others could be found but they will be at least 3 • 4 miles away # as for instance east of the fombs on the RIFA*A road, near JUDHAFS on the BUDAUXA road or else on MUHARBAQ island. The present situation will probably be preferred owing to its proxi- -mity to the proposed buildings on the sea shore near the Seaplane station, 3, As regards the possible constructions of the EasternBastern and General Syndicate. They hare at present^explor- vill -atory lloenoe and/no doubt xiii apply for a prospecting licenoe, and in duo couroe for a mining lioenae. Under the latter thoy have ' the right to oonotruot pipe lineo refineries and storage tanks, railway wharves, and jetties, tramways, roads, huildings, machinery and tele- -graph apparatus of all kinds in any part of the terri- -tory of the Shaikh so far as may be necessary for their business' „ According to this clause they could presumably erect a refinery in the middle of the aerodrome# The only space they have so far intimated as likely to be necessary for refineries, wharvon etc, is that part • South oast from the bridge knovm as BADAK AL KAURI ( Shaikh Ali's bridge ) a distance of 4 miles along the coast, and two miles in land from the high water mark. Ho part of this area lies north of the RADAM AL KAURI, It extends to a point opposite the southern most point of SITRA Island •, This area I have marked in red in my tracing but according to ny calculations this makes a die- stance of more than four miles, though none of this would inte/rfere with either the present, the late landing ground or the seaplane harbour. The former is on the north side of the harbour and as regards the latter, these construc- -tions could not be any higher than the date trees which at present fringe the lagoon. Their idea in selecting this site is to have proximity to a deep water harbour for loading their tankers and unloading their heavy machinery. when it is definitely known that the Eastern and General Syndicate are desirous of renewing their ui concession, His Excellency might insert a clause proving that the landing ground wherever it may be, should be kept clear of buildings etc, provided of course that the Royal Air Force are able to make up their minds as to theirtheir requirenento. As regards the seaplane anchorage, I do not consider that the activities of the Syndicate, even the development of wharves and a deep water harbour further south along the coast, can have any effect upon its usefulness, and Z do not think Shaikh Hamad would consider it necessary fer -fw- this to be leased as it is of no ooEunercial value to the State. Z understand, also, that he is willing to gift the Koyal Air Force or the Political Agent en their behalf, a site for a building en the shore to the north of the anchorage I have the honour to be.

Sir, I am comimanded by the Air Council to refer to Colonial Office letter of the 26th April, 69035/29, on the subject of the oil concession in the Bahrein Islands, and to the conference which was held in the Petroleum Department on the 7th May, and to acquaint you, for the info mat ion of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, that apart from the general question of British control of cornpaniea prospecting for oil in British Colonies and Protectorates, the Council are interested in future developments in Bahrein owing to the existence on the island of a landing ground, to the maintenance of which they attach great importance in connection with the development of the air route on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf. The landing ground is situated on the northern extre ity of Bahrein Island opposite to kuharra Island, and close to the W/T station in Latitude 26° 14' Horth, Longitude 50° 35» East. The Council trust that in any negotiations for the development of oil bearing land in the island steps will be taken to preserve the amenities of the site for flying, and that they may be consulted before any action is taken which might result in t he erection of obstructions in the immediate vicinity of the landing ground.

WMOmjEWMi I have been asked by the Hon'ble the Political Resident to ascertain from you the cost of hiring the plots cultivated by ShaiJsh Sulaiaan, and also the reminder of the ground Required for the aerodrome# Do you consider it would be posible to obtain suffi cient space by Tmimxlv&amp;s remoring the aerodrome very slightly to the North and more consideraoxy to the West. 1/ Political Agent, Bahrein.P.O. lfo.C/99 Tiie Agency, Bahrein, August the 5th 1929. Please refer to your D.0. No. 285-S dated the I8th July 1929. I think it would be a fatal mistake to allow the deputation of an R.A.J 1 . officer to Bahrein or any other place in the Gulf# His position would amount to that of a M€i military attache', and experience shows that these worthies are nearly always a stumbling 'block in the paKth of the Poli tical authorities, particularly in undeveloped places# To my personal knowledge they have been such in Kabul and Meshed, where they frequently held viwws diametrically opposed to ours, and though these views were not those of H#M,Government and were based in many cases on incomplete information, they did not hesitate to air them, often with the support of the General Staff# 2# Here the situation would be more serious. The Political Agent might often be a junior officer, and so long as we have the millstone of our military rank round our neistks the deputation of a Squadron Leader or Wing Commander would cause difficulties. Further, the Military attaches in the places mentioned have invariably been officers of the Indian / Army, or officers with long Indian experience, whereas the R.A.F have not got such a body of men,experienced in the East, to draw upon. They come out so rapidly to the East that # ■ t ey arrive at Bahrein with a Balham mind, and on the Trucial., Coast with the reactions of Tooting. Lastly, I have &lt; ^ ■■.' met practically no R.A.F# officers ith the sosccial qualifi cations required. . t 3. I will deal with Air Commodore 1 ® Burnetts / , /.,-/*■' ■■ ' objects in detail. As regards (a) Mespers make all afe^ogeiaenarrangements for petrol and oil and seem to manage It without difficulty. No officer ia needed for this. |b) The coastal reconnaissance will presumably be made from the air, and would therefore probably be done by Howe. The work will not take long, as most of the coastline is a he howling desert, and much of it has already been surveyed. If any reconnaissance is required at Jubail, qatif or Ojair I trust that it will be done in conjunction with myself. |c) I dont want a liaison officer, and the last thing we want is another brand of British Official to dtract the attention of the Shaikhs from the officers of the Department. Already people like Thomas and the Uayy are better known between Sur and Sila thai we are, and another year or two of this coupled with an R.A.p. invasion and we shall heco™ com plete ciphers. To give you an idea the position we have now reached I will quote a remark made quite unconsciously by one of ngr recent guests. He said ' The Command pt - of ths has just had to fine the Shaikh of ( I think he said Shargah) Shargah two thousand rupees.' I inquired why, but he did not know and seemd to think that it was quite within his pre rogative to do so if he wished to. • You will also find in the appropriate file at Sabzabad a reproof Col.Prideaux had to admin-'iter the S.N, 0. for acknowle dging the succeBainn of a .'rucial Chief without a reference to the Residency, in fact I believe it was you who drew his attention to it. i.d) I am confidTent that I could revise the Handbook of Arabia as far my area ig concerned. The Gazetteer has been revised by Major Hoel I believe. le) Matters between the 3.H.0. and the R.A.ff. are always ' ettled in direct coramunication by Baghdad or Ba»rah and I am certain a junior officer in Bahrein would have lit tle to do with it. The Navy seldom come here, and in any case desire to have as little liaison with the R.A.F. as possible. 4. As regards Mr, remark that his tour would requireyour sanction, I laave noticed that the attitude of the Mili- tray forces before and after they get what they want undergoes a great change, and I sure that once posted to the Gulf such an officer would have little regard for the Resident and defer to his wishes less and less.

He still wants to fly over it and photograph it, and walk round and see pos sible sites from the ground, and so I have decided to postpone ny recess and, subject to your approval,go back there with theia and engage the attention of Shaikh Shakhbut while they have a look round. I told Shalfchbut that I would come back to see him, and as the H.A.F. have a framed photo to give him we have an opening. They ant to spend a night at Yas on the way back, and netiher night will be particularly comfortable, but I think their early steps on and near the Trucial Coast should as far as possible undertaken with our assistance. This arrangement will also give Howe time to decide something about the aerodrome here. It is really almost impossible to lil^p them as they change their minds so frequently and now think that they will have their base in Khow Kaliyya and their buildings and workshops on the edge of the sea at Qadha- biah by SlmikhRashid , s house. I explained that they would not get a site here free* I am going to make Howe put into writing e%ctly what they want and get the Bahrein Government surveyors to mark off eaSjgctly what they want for the aerodrome# /hen this done, we can act, and until then we shall be simply wasting our time.

The usual procedure is for all Oovernment Depart- -ments to approach the State authorities — Belgrave {also Thomas in Muscat) is a State not a British Government official — through the Political Agent or the Kesidenoy Agent. Belgrave has referred to Prior for advice in this particular case and the latter has wired to me and I have told them that Belgrave had better supply the information required, sending his reply through the Political Agent, I am sorry for worrying you about these petty matters whore the error in procedure is excusable, hut it Involves the principle on which I set great store, that in dealing with these pebty Arab Shaikhs there must be one British authority only. Bahrain is snore advanced than the others but none has yet reached the stage where the Polit- -ical Agent can afford to be ignorant of any of the details of Government's relations with his Shaikhs. 1?ven in his dealings with the Trucial Chiefs the senior Naval officer and his Commanders always deal through Khan Bahadur XMajfc Isa \bdul Latif.

I enclose a copy of a letter I have just received from the Adriser to the Bahrain Government together with two maps. A third map is in my possession. 2. Before going into the matter I wish to say that I am experiencing great difficulty in settling the question of an aerodrome by the Protean demands of the Royal Air Porce. I persoaally went over the aerodrome with Wing Commander Howe and Sir Geoffry Salmond and heard their views. When Wing Commander Howe returned from Karachi he went out with a survey -or and mde a plan which differed considerably from what had prewiously been settled, but imagining him to be a plenipot entiary, I asked him to let me lenow in writing what he wanted and took action accordingly. 3. Now it appears that someone siie has a finger in the pie, but not having discussed the matter with him, I can only leave his views for the decision of the Royal Air Force Head quarters. You will appreciate that a considerable confusion is caused both to me and the Bahrain State authorities by thin indecision. Buhsire. Memorandum. With reference to the corresp ndenceregarding the 4.

I recommend the suggestion of the Adyiser that he be offerred 50Q/~per annum for the open land (enclosure 'C'), and as this is approximately the original plan of Sir Geoffrey Salmond and Wing Comirander Howe it may recommend itself to the Royal Air force. 5. The Shaikhs stipulations appear to me to be eminently reasonable, and I suggest their inclusion in any lease that may be granted. 6. In conclusion, I would request that unless the matter brooks no delay, any further alterations of the aerodrome may await my return to Bahrain, for it is imposiible for me to offer opinions on requests that hay^ been made to a third per son, which may not even be correctly repo ted, and which may also be liable to alteration at short notice. j P _ ^ - Oaptaliif Political Agent,Bahrain.Reference |03S/29/3/Alr.l K 0.2C3# () Squadron, Royal Air Force, Margil, BASRAH« 1 IRAQ. 17th.

July, 1929, I have examined TJjjtjJie landing, ground already marked out at MANAMA and agree that » the site is suitable having good road connection with, and being f^in close prosaimity to the town an.d to the present flying boat moorings and,also, to a good alternative site for moorings in KHOR KALIYA BriY, 2 AREA . In addition to the 1800 feet square marked on the , it is considered desirable that the whole of the area enclosed .isrithin the aerodrome boundary line shown on the plan should be leased by the Royal Air Force to prevent further encroachment; and that Shaikh Sulman, the owner of one of the existing encroachments, should be persuaded to withdraw and compensated for loss of possession. The land lying to the westward side of the aerodrome and between it and the date gardens should be reserved at a nominal rental to prevent the erection of buildings or other obstructions to flying which may otherwise arise. 5. MARK BIG AI.D lEVELL IM G , It is recommended that a concrete circle approximately 10 feet in diameter should be provided at once and painted white at the spot chosen as the centre of the aerodrcme which has been marked with a ?/ooden peg. This would later on be replaced by the standard circle of approximately 50 feet diameter. Levellingof the mounds, boundary posts, and other ridges and small inequalities should be commenced from the centre working outwards till the whole area within the boundary of the aerodrcme is considered satisfactory for the use of the aeroplanes* The comers of the aerodrome should then be indicated by n L u shaped markingseach change od? direction 10 feet long A 4 feet broad. If not removed, the stone ridge at the N.W. Comer should be indicated with one or two white crosses to indicate the existing obstruction. Further advice and instructions can always be provided by the personnel of flying boats on their periodical visits to BAHREIN . 4. AGCOMMODATIQ3. The location of the petrol store and any other necessary buildings should be on the eastern side of the aerodrome near KHOR KALIYA BAY so as to be available for the joint use of land planes and flying boats. If the old Quarantine Station is taken over by the Royal Air Force this site would probably serve the dual purpose, although rather far from the aerodrome.

There is no objection to the presence of cultivation of crops of mormal size right up to the actual edge of the landing ground. This does not of course include palm trees* It is definite obstructions such as trees, houses, wires of any kind, oil derricks etc, that are dangerous to aircraft approaching an aerodrome. It is preferable that the site at Manama should be adopted as the Royal Air Force landing ground on Bahrein Island, owing to its proximity to the seaplane moor ings and Rest House. Nevertheless, I consider it would be advisable to retain the old landing ground near ^IFAA because it is possible that civil air routes may pass through Bahrein in the future# We have had correspondence on this subject# 6. I note that you are enauiring whether the Manama site can be moved slightly north and west and will await your reply before discussing the cuestion of the existing encroach ments « 7. 1 agree that the area in which the Eastern and General Syndicate have been granted an exploratory licence is sufficiently distant from Manama and that any developments will not interfere with the landing ground at that place# I have the honour to be.

He states (l) txiat y/ing Commander Howe was discourteous to the t0 the Kfrs-n Sahib in his office and to the Khan Sahib r s employees on the beach. U) That two Officers assaulted a taxi driver engaged for them. (3) That two Officers complained to the Khan Sahib in his Office and in a somewhat discourteous manner, that the labour asked for was not available, when in fact it was standing by the plane. (4) That two other ranks of the crew- compelled a taxi driver specially engaged for their service to carry more than the regulation number of passengers, in consequence of which he lost his license. (5) That the two Officers referred to above complained that the taxi drivers supplied did not possess a sufficient knowledge of English.- ( 2 ) - As a GQUffiiercial firm it is not our business to investigate and follow up such complaints, but in view of our Agent's long and satisfactory service to us, we feel bound to give him all reasonable assistance. We need hardly refer to the Khan Sahib's atatus in Bahrein, nor to his services to His Britannic Majesty's Government, as you are fully aware of these. We have therefore advised the Khan Sahib to seek your advice and assistance, and at the same time we have pleasure in recommending his case to your favourable consideration. With regard to the handling of R.A.F. supplies, it appears to us that the Officer Commanding a03(2f.B.) Squadron R.A*F. is not fully informed on the subject. It is outside of our normal business activities to handle oils belonging to other interests, and it was only at the special request of the Air Officer Commanding, that we came to an arrangement with the Assistant Director of Supplies and Transport to receive here, ship to destination, store and issue supplies to H.A.F. craft. The letter of Squadron Leader Howe dated 15th instant addressed to our Agent, with a copy to you, is contrary to this arrangement and we cannot therefore accept it pending reference to Air Headquarters; we have written officially to our Agent instructing him to follow our previous instructions, which means that he will not be able to act in accordance with Squadron Leader Howe's letter. The writer is proceeding to Baghdad next week and will take the opportunity of calling on Air Headquarters, to discuss R.A*F. Gulf Supplies. We might add that such other work as our Agent may be asked to perform by the R.A.P. e^g. provision of transport, he has our instructions to give his best attention to.- ( 3 ) - Our General lianager telegraphed you briefly today in the above sense, and we await with interest your reply thereto.

Sir, I have the honour to forward a imp showing the 1 area which it hae heen proposea nhoula be tajcen over by the Hoyal Air Force an an aerodrome in Bahrain* The Political Agent reports trnt im ie in great doubt as to the area you wish to acquire for this purpose as various suggestions have been imde by different officers. If you will inform me of your reauireiaenta he will negoti ate for acqAisition. When Wing Commander Howe returned from Karachi he went out with a surveyor and mde a plan which differed considerably from v?hat had been previously proposed; but the Political Agent, imagining that he had full powers, made his arrangements to meet 'Zing Commander Howe's wishes. It appears however that a special Hoyal Air Force Officer has since visited Bahrain, who considers that the land in the south-east corner is not needed for the aerodrome. for the enlarged aerodrome, which ie about double the size of the original square, the v uler of Bahrain is asking for an annual rent of lln* 2500. He is willing to lease 'he aerodrome for ten, twenty ot thirty years but would Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, Baghdad,- 2 - © would like to inB©rt a clause in the lease stipulating that the aerodrome laay be used, freely # by Imperial Airways or any machine which the Ruler perxaits to cure to Bahrain. He wishes to insert a further clauue that the right to erect buildings •— other tiuin those necessary for Royal Air Force purposes, to mine or to cultivate the lanci has not been leased. The land marked 'B* and H C H in the property of Shaikh Bulalmart* It is a square 633 1 7 635* . One half marked 'B* 1 is partly cultivated and irrigated and is surrounded by a fence. 'he other 'mlf *0* is open ground, not yet cultivated, Bhaikh fulaiman asks for Its. 1600 per annum for «B W nrsd 'CP or Is. 800 per annuia for 'B 11 only # but he is open to an offer. The price is high but Bhaikh Bulaiman points out that the ground is valuable owing to its plenti ful water supply fron all artesian well, and that there is no other land in the vicinity which the rtate could give him in compensation. Mr Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Govern- meat# su^jgeslts tlmt if possible th&lt; enclosed land should not be touched, and if tlie remainder is really necessary Bhaikh Bulaiman should be given Rs. 500 for it. Without *B H however 'C* would appear to me to be useless except as a possible site for a building. I shall be glad 1 to hear, firstly, as to the exact area required and t secondly, as to the annual rent you would be prepared to pay. If the area wi thin the red line exclusive of 'B* and 'C* will suffice for your purpose, I suggest, though 1 personally have not consulted the Ruler, that a rent of £120 annually will suffice. The Bali rain State will endeavour to keep clear from3 from buildings and palm trees that part of the area adjoining the aerodrone which is not private property. I have the honour to be.

As Bin Saud has definitely refused to sanction the reconnoitring of an emergency landing ground there seems no longer any reason for sending Colonel Dickson to Qatif.

Confidential 1-/1 The Agency, Bahrain. 25th November 102J. From To The Political Agent, Bahrain. The Hon'ble the Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf, Bushlre. Sir I have the honour to submit the following report upon » my cruises with the Flying Boats. In accordance with your instructions I left on the llth Movember for Darin. Wing Commander Howe and Wing Coirimander IC# I H*A*_^/ C.Buss, the Officer in charge of the Ira^rintelligence were in the party as well as Squadron Leader Fullard of Air Force Head- quarters Baghdad. It was intended that we should proceed to Darin where we were expected, but we went instead to Q^atif, and anchored there. I took, the opportunity to call on the Amir, who had not replied to my letter suggesting that I should pay a visit to Q,atif ( doubtless not having received a reply from Bin Saud ) and after some delay, he received us^ 2. The Amir seemsed unaccountably nervous, possibly due to our unexpected arrival, and was apologetic for the lacic of preparation and inquired how long we proposed to stay. I had sent my interpreter over from Bahrain the night before, and he now came in with Abdul Aziz Qus dbi, having come by lau from Mxkx Darin, and they told us that preparations had been made for us at Darin. We therefore took leave of the Amir and returned to Darin,which e had flown over on the outward journey, xsz&amp;xxKkKXKecA by flying boat. 3. We anchored off the aerodrome, which is on the mainland side of Darin, in± deep water, and went ashore on don keys as the shallows extend for nearly a quarter of a mile.Page 2. a The QueaiMs had lunch witing for us^ and the aerodrome was then examined. Apart from the fact that they had enclosed it with a high fence» and that the corner i&amp;fciibam sMXHXKiM&amp;jfc# were marked with pillars instead of flat triangles the R*A.3? officers considered it a very creditable effort on the part of amateurst and they decided to leave it where it was after marking larger boundaries in the direction ofnthe prevailing wind. Huts had been built for the pilots who are to come, completely fitted with beds and bedding, and a large petrol and bomb tore had been built on the sea Bh ore 4. We were asked to stay the night, but I had much to do and ling Com ander Howe considered the anchorage of the sik flying boats very exposed ( a 25 knot wind was blowing ) and so we returned to Bahrain. The Wing Commander and one flying boat returned next day to make further observations, but since they were not going to ^atif, and I was anxious to be away from Bahrain as little as possible, I did not accompany them. They returned in the afternoon without incident. 5. On the I3th one fl ing boat returned to Basrah, and the second with myself and Wing Commander Howe and S/X Ful 1 ard reconnoitred Salwa Bay. The trip proved most in- t teresing, for it enabled me to shed light on an ancient con ed troversy. We proceed due west from Bahrain and followed the coast down drawing out for Ojair and another small hamlet which we saw, and reached Salwa Bay after some two hours flyin Recalling the ancient controversy regarding the site of Gerra I hoped to see something from the plane which would shed some light on it. We located two wells from the plane, and then, since the place appeared to be deserted we came down and an chored, and inflating our little boat went ashore. Beyond a very distant camel, and a bedu on camel back whom we had seen from the air, their were no igns of life, and W/C Howe S/L Fullard and I examined the dwarf clumps of palms, and the ^receirU) two wells, md found no sign oflhuman habitation. Cheesemaii* s fiescrlptlon -if the bay in his work ' Unknown Arabia • is ac-P^e 3. ^STJ curate» and there is no necessity for me to repeat it. 6. We examined the castle he describest and found it a very humble ruin round one of the wells# with the remains of a tower in one corner. Apart from this there are no ruins» and though on leaving we climbed to 3000 feet we could Be? no signs of other ruinst so that if Gerra is anywhere in this vi cinity it must be where Chceseman places it» namely in the s field of ruin# behind JBfcxxx Ofair. We returned up the coat to the islands of A1 Hawar without seeing any trace of human habitation&gt; but were able hile fJying high at Salwa bay to see the Khor al Odaid in the distance. From the AlHawar islands we returned to Bahrain. * 7. They were busy on the machine on the I4th and on the 15th we left for Abu Dhabi. I had been unable# since the R.A.F* were uncertain of their movements, to tell Shaikh Ab dullah of ^atar exactly when I hould be visiting him and so we stopped for a few minutes on the way out to leave a mes age for him* I was told that he was hunting a long way out and would hardly be back by Sunday the I7th f which was the day we hoped to see him. 8. After Wakra we saw no real sign of habitation un- s til we ar ived at Abu Dhabi# though a very few fihing boats were seen between Sila and Jebel Thanni opposite Yas Island# Sila itself appears to be a solitary well with numerous camel tracks leading to it, and signs of a well and a hut or two were seen at Mirfa# and another well due south of the island of Abul Abyadh. It is not surprising that ships have been reluc tant to venture into this area for it is seen from the air to be a veritable stoneyard, deep water giving place to a reef in the space of a few yards. 9. On Arrival at 'bu Dhabi the Residency Agent sent his clerk off to meet me and met me on the beach and took us h- to a house on the shore which the Shaikh had lent him. He told me that he had been doing his best to persuade the Shaikh (the last Shakhboot to agree to a petrol tank at Yas forTsix days, but that he tod no success# and he asked my help. Later thePage 4. Shaikh came to see me hut the moment did not seem opportune to brach thr matter. He Is of course quite under the thumb of his rel tives and his uncle Khalifa in particular. He did not dine with us hut sent a dinner over which wc eat with the Residency Agent and his staff, 10. ext morning he arrived somewhat late, and after general conversation I asked him if he could help us in the matter of the petrol tank, pointing out that wc did not want kra to force him into any agreement, and that it was not pro posed to erect large buildings or to do anything which would interfere in any way with their use of the isl nd. He was extremely nervous but final y stuttered out that he could not gifee us what was wanted. Seeing that his mind was made up I decided not to waste any more time but to continue the jour ney. On the beach he started to say something to me, but changed his mind and said that he could not talk with people round him. The fact of the matter is that he Is afraid of his relations,who are suspicious of our intentions, and in this refusal we are only reaping the fruit of the neglect of the Trucial Coast since the war# 11. Our movements were complicated by the fact that the H.A.f were uncertain where their petrol was, and we had to take the Heeidency Agent's cleric and drop hixn at Dibat to have the petrol taken to Shargah. Isa bin Abdul Latif expressed the greatest surprise that it had been intended to place petrol at Dibai as he said no request tod been made to the Shaikh at all. S/L Fullard was much impressed with the lagoon at Dibai whi 4 h though narrow is parallel to the prevailing winds' and hence most useful for taking off, whereas the Ras al Khai- mah lagoon is at right angle to the prevailing wind, and the flying boats have difficulty in getting off there if there is a strong wind. 12. We saw no sign of the•Khuzistan' and went on to His el Khaimeh and refuelled, stopping at Hamriacyah on the way but finding the Shaikh out. After refueling we flew to Sir Abu Hair to spend the night, as I had said that it would onlyV- Page 5. confuse and alarm the Shaikh at Uiam el ^aiwain if we turned up there unexpectedly and bivouacked on the edge of the lago01 t Sir bu '-air we found a Shargah fishing boat drawn upt and when I had calmed their fears they took three of us ashore and we slept on the beach. The water here is drinkable but brackishf and on the S.W, side of the island there is a good anchorage for flying baots, except from a qaus wind. We saw one of the wild cats for which the island is noted, and it appeared suspiciously like the domestic variety. 13. itmm Prom here we flew back to Yas and circled over * it to take photographs and then returned to Pohah. Here we found Shaikh Abdullah, bin Jasim still away^but on his way bacJ^ and his fat son, Hamadtwhom he had sent on to meet me, came off to the boat. I returned his call at the fort, but as there was no point in staying when the Shaikh was away we said good bye and returned to Bahrain, arriving at about 16 hrs 14. The flight was full of interest, and many correc tions have been made on the chart, but owing to the misbehaviou of the vertical camera brought specially for the trip, the photographic results will probably be disappointing. The reverse at Abu Dhabi was unfortunate, but as I only arrived one evening and left the next morning, I was not able to do much that was useful. I dont think the. Shailch has the slightest idea what we really want, and if a photograph of one of the sunk petrol tanks on the Baghdad-Damascus route were shown him it would prove to him how little we really want. If in addition his ' heart was made good 1 with a present of a rifle, and his uncle Khalifa pacified, I think he would proh- bahly withdraw his objections. ''hat they fear is that a petrol tank is only the thin end of the wedge, and that demands would follow. 15. A feature of the flight was the Bin Saud pror ganda met everywhere. At Abu Ehabi we heard that the B ? tish Govrnment had brought all their planes to qatifPage 6. help him and that I&gt;awish was s ing for peace, and at Ras- el-Khaimah we heard that he had come in person to Abu Dhabi with six planes. S: Considering that the ^usaibis have been steadily uttering lies for the last six months it is surprising how much faith is put in the canards they spread, but whether it is the Q,usaibis or others there is no doubt that they are rendering Bin Saud a signal service and that his cause profits by the rumours of victories they assiduously spread. .

Prom the political point of view, the trip was not a great success owing the the continual emtjai^assments provided by the R.'.F. At the very a t|rt, when we; set out for Darin there^was no question of our going to Qatif, nor did I want.to visit, among a mob of other people. As we passed Darin, the aerodrome was clearly visible, and we passed a launch obvious ly intended for us which, in addition, waved to attract our attention, but the pilot of the leading plane for reasons which ; ■' V we /ere unable to fathom either then or afterwards, flew to tesijt qatif and anchored there. ,$e had to fofiow suit, and since we had arrived I felt it was impossible to go without ■ seeing the Amir. 3. Hassan qusaibi who was in my plane was suspicious of our intentions but uent word on for us, and gave us coffee in the Customs, a wrJjeched place. After considerable delay I was told the Amir was ready. He received us, in a very hast ily adorned mejlis, and with much nervousness inquired our move- , ■'/ 'f ir.ents. Buss { did you know they were sending the head of their Intelligence down here ? ) thought that his conscience must be pricking him, but I am certain it was nothing but this unexpec ted incursion of Ferangir which upset him. Mot realising that some present understood English some of our party made comments on our surroundings which must have certainly been re- t iled after we had gone. 4. During lunch n amusing incident occurred. Howe feeling that something must be said about the really very credi table lunch provided, turned to Hassan Qusaibi who was sitting but not eating with us, and said * MsJfcsck Hatha moo zain 1 v tMs ir r; good 1 and pointed at thp fnnr?.iPage 2# V y Buss and I looked incredulously at each other, and Hassan's ce was a s u y, till Buss said * what did you mean to say * You TilTllt^Tft l e v t0 explain th t he had the opposite. You will notice that Hassan was not eating with us. Had I been alon^ he would have. ^ry disturbed teat we should hear «nH t 0 ' P ro P^ an ^ a they dish up in Bahrain, and ere particularly nervous of my Interpreter Sayyid Abdur Rezzaq. They were not pleased that we should hear the masons working on the petrol store grumble that they had not been paid ior tnree weeks, and anybody who might conceivable say anything interesting was kept well away, , ^ ^ ^ound Shaikh Shakhboot thoroughly sulky when we arrived t Abu Phabi, but after an hours talk he became his usual cheerfu]. self. Then I went for a walk on the beach, and the flying boat moved, without warning, round to the lagoon a mile away to be out of the wind. I came back and found him and his uncle sitting on the beach glowering, and muttering that the plane would be shot up by bedu and that they would be held responsible. Next day, had I had time, something might have been done but I could not get him away from his rela-tives. It is hopele b trying to do anything in these flying visits, they only unsettle the people and do no good at all. What is wanted is a stay of at least two days, and to go out hawking with him or shooting, and then after suitably insulting him with a rifle or other useful gift, there is some hope of get ting him to do what one wants. Also one has to find out which relatives^count and talk them over, and it all takes time. If we try and force him him in this instance we hall make a great mistake, and anynpoints that we lose in the game will be thank fully collected by our ally Bin Baud. He is a menace and noth ing else to o r power on tJie Trucial Coast. 7. hy we stopped at Hamriyah I could not discover, for there is no lagoon and it is useless for the . though the Shaikh is very firnedly. Howe has no iclea what a nuisance the flying boats are to everyone, and thought our arrival would be a treat for the Shaikh. He was away paying a call at Dibai. I persuaded them not to stop the night at Um-el-Q,aiwain, as the Shaikhs would hav« sat up half the night wondering whether they should sen«' us guards or feed us or what we wanted. I do not consider that the Truciaal Coast is yet in a condition when hap hazard cruising by the R^A*'FJ is likely to be useful, or in fact anyh|ting but what it is how, a potenti 1 danger. 8. The night at Sir Abu Nair was uneventful, but next morning both Howe and Fullard asked me if it would be all righgh to bathe, and I told them that they could not bathe in front o f the fishermen naked. We went to the other side of the spit here there was cover, but after the bathe Fullard felt he need ed exercise and ran a quarter of a mile along the beach in his bit^hday kit. The fishermen must have thought him mad. At Q.atar th- difficulties of paying political visits from a plane reached their climax. . The fat son Hamdd came off to see me, and as there was no place outside I asked him in. Coming i^he stuck in the pilots seat, and X thought to help him by pulling his leg, and Abdul Rezzaq by pressing on his head- but he was trying all the time to get out/ However, he got in at last, and promptly lent back against some oily wires. One of the crew was preparing lunch and I sudrenly thought thalf t, 'ohe c^f^fei^e^rew-must have been affected by the water at Sir Abu Nair and looked hastily round, and found that the dreadful smell issued from a tin of Brussel sprouts he had just opened. The Shaikh broke out into a profuse sweat, and I hastily said that I thought I should like to come and s e the forst. We got him out with some difficulty and he left for the shore. Later when returning his c 11 I asked him if e would like a short flight and he excused himself. 9.

X am not aware what point has been reached in the negotiation with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, but if he has approved of the undertaking 4 rifles with the party should suffice. The whole of the maritime population will be occupied with the diving, and beyond the possibility of some Bedouin bent on thieving straying over from the main land there is little.to fear.

It would probab y be siapleet, as you suggest, to ship the party to Bahrain and to tranship the® to launches there. Dhosrs would not be suitable as August is a period of calms and they might take weeks to reach thei I destination. The largest launches available here carrying 20-25 tons could be hired $ at not less than Bs 20/- per diem) and used to t^gpsport stores and men to Tas Island. At leasPf!l®fc would be re uired, one of which could be returned, the other two being retained and used for fetch iog water and provisions from Dohah { Qatar ) or Bahrain. 3- 3 days should be allowed for the journey. With a fortnights notice such launches would be available in %ugust but would be expensive, the pearling season being at its height. 3. Labour is scarce and expensive in August. At that time sufficient unskilled Persian labour willing to go to las Island would probably be availabie, but it migh I be necessary to pay as much as Rs 2/- per diem. The rate is liable to fluctuations, and at the moment is about re 1/4 per diem. Labour would be cheaper in October and probably launches also and the westher would be cooler . This is also a calm month and damage of cargo in the laun r fe- would be unlikely.4. It is suggested that the stores should be transhipped direct in Bahrain harbour, so saTiag all port dues and customs charges. If thit, is not done the stores aust be c;early marked R.E. ( Re Export ) or ' Tranship Oargo n &gt; 5» The wster at Yas is brackisn and better water could be obtained without difficulty from Dohah ( ^atar ) one of the launches bein; used for this. It must be rem em bered that, all water on this coast is bmckish and that it is merely a question of degree. 6. I will deal with the question of protection later ana confirm the rates uoted after making further enquiries. I sa assuming that the c ncurrence of the Hon'ble the Political Resident has bean obtained and that he approtes of work being commenced in August. I Political Agent, Bahrain. 'Telegram. G.T.Code.

II6-C dated the Slst June .1930, regarding cer tain proposed works at Yas Island. 2* I have been obliged tOyMr .Omlil Kanoo into my confidence and have obtained some figures from him. It will not be poes.ible to give final figures or conclude a definite contract without giving further publicity to the matter, and when the labour is hired, the news will of course become pub lic property* He has only one suitable launch, and when the other two are hired, the information will then equally become public* 3* He estimates that three launches will be required» and launches capable of carrying 25 tons each will be employed* The hire of a launch to Qatar is at present 100/- and another I00/~ for the return journey* Yas Island is another day away so he reckons 400/- for the round trip will be necessary. In addition to this a charge of 30/- will be made each day the Taucnh is detained* It will tnerefore be for consideration whether two launches could not be dismi sed, and one retained to bring the party back, and do liason work or carry messages. it being assumed th t practically all the 70 tons of stores I do not recomL end them unless time is no object. 4* He is of opinion that owing to the poor pearling season there would be little advantage in postponing matters till October, though launches would be more readily available. It must be realised th t he h mself has only one suitable launch a nd will require a weeks notice, and that he cannot guarantee will remain at Yas would of course be cheaper butPage 2. the price of the other two for which he will make the best arrangement that can 'be m de at the time» The two extra launches should have two weeks notice. 5. He is confident of obtaining reliable unskilled labour&gt; probably Persians&gt; at 35/- a month# and would require a we^ks notice to be certain of them. The price is less than I had anticipated f and if he undertakes to produce them I am sure Mr Hkalil &amp;anoo will be as good as his word. It would be probably advisable to pay the money to h m and not th them, and make him entirely responsible, leaving all questions of advances and rationing to hiau He is a large employer of labour of this type and understands them. 6. He tells me that he can obtain a 600 gallon tank for water at a rate of hire of approximately 20/- per mensem, and at a gallon a day this should suffic.e the party for three weeks, each launch carrying in addition as part of its hire sufffcient water for the Journey. This tank would be carried on one of the launches. 7. You will see from the foregoing that the first launch will require a weeks notice and the other two a fortntii night's, and that the labour will require a week's notice. The matter will cease to be confidential directly the extra launches or labour are hired. 8. I have not so far received any reply from the Hon'ble the Political Resident regarding the question of pro tection, and will make a statement regarding this later. I am assuming that the cargo will be transhipped at sea, and will ask the Bahrain Government to agree to this when the time comes. C) ct Political Agent, Bahrain.gnnfiden tial. 0.0.

There is therefore no question of putting the petrol tanks down there at an early date and I hope you will stop Khalil Kanoo talking about the matter as I particul arly do not want rumours to get round the Gulf until I have seen the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. As regards protection for the party at Yas Island, I do not think you need send a reply to the Chief Engineer. This is a matter for me to deal with and I will take it up with the Air Officer Commanding. If the Chief Engineer makes any reference to you on the subject, please refer him to me.

Ho. 230 C. 20th December 1930. From Captain C.G.Prior I.A. Political /gent, Bahrain. To The Hon'ble Lt.-Col.H.V.Biscoe I.A. Political Resident, Persian Gulf. Sir, I hare the honour to say that I visited Yas by air on the I7th December and returned to Bahrain on the I8th December, calling at Pohah on the outward journey. 2. On arrival at Bohah I heard confidentially that the leading man of Dalmah had been instructed by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to proceed to Yas and see what was being done there and stop any work that was being done there. On arri val at Yas I heard that he had been there, but that he had done nothing and gone over to the mainland to hunt. I did, however, find a representative from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, who had come there direct by jollyboat, and he presented me with a letter from the Shaikh which read as folibows:- * I have heard from the people of Yas that your men have come to the said Island, stnd have settled down there and built tents without our sanction, and we have not been referred to about it. This is not what we expected of your justice. Ishallah you will turn your men away from our island when it becomes known to you * 3. I told his messenger that the Shaikh was fully informed about the undertaking last month, and saic thatt the work was sanctioned hy you and could not he discontinued. He requested that either you or I should go to Abu Dhabi andand Page 2. that it would be ' alchyar '(best) if the Shaikh*s agreement was obtained, I said that you were busy and that it was very unlikely that you could spare the time, and I said that I could not go without your orders, and that in any case I had been there on the same errand over a year ago, without the Shaikh agreeing to the proposal. 4# He then urged that I should give him a letter for the Shaikh, which I did simply saying that the work was what had been explained to him and was being done with your orders, and that it was not possible to discontinue it. As the only writer available seemed to be less proficient than rzgxMtt. me, I was obliged to write it myself. The represen tative asked with ome nervousness what buildings it was pro posed to erect, and appeared relieved when I told him that I knew of none other save the tank. Ke said that the Shaikh was very afraid that it might be damaged by Bed%in and I reassured him on this point,telling him that it would be almost entirely under the ground and incapable of damage without explosives. I think that if my suggestion of show ing the Shaikh a photograph of one in situ in Iraq, much of his apprehension would have been allayed at the start. 5. The messenger had come in a small jollyboat an^ only seemed to have 3-4 unarmed men with him. Since he took 1 five days in a jolly boat to come and since it would presuma bly take nearly twice as much to go to Abu Dhabi and back again I consider that the work will be practically complete before the Shaikh can do anything further, and though the date given for final completion is January the 8th, the last fxsxi few days will be taken up la allowing the concrete to set. I neither heard nor saw any signs of any other persons likely to interfere with the work, and as this cor ner of Arabia is almost empty, I think any further difii- culty unlikely.

Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject:- Maairah. Sir, In continuation of my telegram Ho. l-T of 30th March, I have the honour to submit the following report. 2 * Two flying boats, with Squadron Leader G.W. Bentley, D.P.C. in command, arrived at Muscat on the evening of the 25th, and 'Penzance' under Commander R.A. Startin, A.M., on the morning of the 26th# Corrmander Startin, Squadron Leader Bentley and myself had a conference on the morning of the latter date. Squadron Leader Bentley confirmed the fact that the object of the agreement which I was to make with the Sheikh of Masirah wa s threefold i.e. aerodrome, refuelling station, probably a barge, and buoys for mooring flying boats. It was also arranged, in the terms of telegram No. A.470 dated 16th of March from Air Officer Commanding, Baghdad, that I should leave Muscat on the corning of the 27th in H.M.S. 'Penzance', and that - if the local situation appears to warrant it - a message should be sent to Squadron Leader Bentley asking him to fly down to Masirah on Sunday morning. /5. Though C 0 p No. 1C1-C Political Agency 5; Muscat, 4th Of 1931. H.B.M's Consulate, April, 1931.3. fhough geographically within the limits of the Muscat State, Politically the latter has no control whatever over the Island, the inhabitants of which consider themselves entirely independent. In these circumstances there appeared to he no advantage, rather the contrary, in obtaining any letter of authority from the State, though I inforned the Council of Ministers informally of my intended visit. On the other hand, as stated in my telegram No. 69-C of 16th March, the presence of intermediaries known to the inhabitants of the Island should prove useful. On our 1 way to Masirsh, therefore, we picked up at Sur Sheikh Muhamad bin Rashid, Jumah bin Mubarak and Abdullah bin Khamis of the Fuwaris section of the Jenebeh, Abdullah himself bein£^ one of the Headmen of the Island (See para. 4 below). We reached Umm Rasas on the evening of the 28th, and Commander Startin and I forthwith landed the three intermediaries who seemed to meet with a favourable reception. They had been instructed to explain to the local inhabitants what was the object of our visit, and to endeavour to win them over. A w/t message was sent to Squadron Leader Bent ley asking him to fly down to Umm Rasas the next morning. Ma si rah Island* 4. On the morning of the 29th I landed at Umm Rasas and had a short conversation with the intermediaries and the local Headmen. The Sheikh of Masirah was not present - it was reported that he was out in his 3adan fishing, but messengers had been sent out during the night to collect Headmen from the rest of the Island, and these were expected in the course of the day. It must be explained, from what I learnt, that theIsland is divided up into various strips cf territory, each under a separate Headman. The main tribe inhabiting the Island, as well as the mainland, is the Jenebeh, though some elements of the Hikman are also found in these areas. The Sheikhs of the Jenebeh are chosen from the M a ja« alah family, Saiyids who came originally - S o it is said from Hadhramaut, and tte Sheikh of the Island, one Khamis bin Hilal, is of this family. According to the Islanders, however, he himself possesses no territory, but maintains existence by fishing at which he is an expert- In regard to the other Headmen (Muqaddimeen) therefore he is merely primcis—itiuerpares if that, though doubtless his influence on our side would be useful. But the actual agreement for R.A.F. requirements, when it is finally concluded, will have to be made both with the Headman who owns the particular strip of territory where these r equirements are best ful filled, and also with the other Headmen as a body since they all would appear to have some say in the granting of foreign concessions. Conversations ?jith the Islanders * Later in the morning Squadron Leader Bentley arrived, and after a short conference with Commander Startin and myself, flew to the Mahut inlet for reconnaissance of that area. 6. In the afternoon Commander Startin, Squadron Leader ^ontley. Flying Officer F.R. Drew and myself, accompanied by the Agency and ship interpreters, landed at Umm Rasas, ^e carried no arms. We were received by the Headmen from various parts of the Island who had now arrived, but the Sheikh was still absent, and did not arrive before our dep arture from the Island on the 3ist.-4 ♦ (g) An inspection of tho ffonna OoMna rpc , m 1)!&gt;lat of view of suitability for an aerodrome, wag made. When this was completed we sat down in the shade of a wall, while the Islanders, Headmen and others, gathered round. After coffee and dates had been dispensed I said that - though the object of our visit had been made known to them by their friends from Sur - I wished to explain to them all, and not only to the Headmen, exactly what we wanted, so that no one could say afterwards that we had gone behind their backs and made secret ag^ments. (In a democratic community like that of Masirah no agreement would te worth much unless backed up by public opinion). I explained that just as it was convenient for caravans to have regular halting places, so it was f 0 r aircraft. That such halt ing places had already been arranged between Aden and Muscat, at Motel la, Dhofar and Re. 3 al Hadd, and that we now wanted one round about Umni Rasas. That we wanted three things! a landing ground for aeroplanes, moorings for flying boats, and a re fuelling station - probably in the form of a barge. 7. J-he meeting replied that the Question should be pint to the Headmen, and the latter absented themselves to discuss the matter. This was of course only a matter of form, as they had had already ample time to make up their minds. After about ten minutes the Headmen returned, and their spokesman said that they oould make no decision without referring the matter to all the Sheikhs of the Maja'alah. Also as a matter of form I noted the names of these Sheikhs, but as they are all scattered all over Oman, the Headman's reply was a polite way of saying No. I remarked that I was sorry to hear this as the consulting of so Kiany Sheikhs would take considerable time, and that meanwhile they - the Islanders - would have to do without the 'presents' which Government were willing to give in return for what we wanted. I said I would leave them to sleep on it, and would0 5. come back the next morning for another telle. They said I would be welcomed, and we went back to the ship leaving behind us a bag of rice as 'ground bait 1 . 8. Next morning I landed again at Uirm Rasas, and had another meeting with the community. While on tte previous evening the attitude of some of the Islanders had been somewhat reserved they were now all extremely friendly, but the Headmen gave the same reply as before. Without stressing the matter unduly, which would merely have given them an exaggerated idea of the importance of themselves and their island, I did my best to talk them over, again hinting that they would not be losers by the transaction, but without success. They did not enquire how much we would be prepared to give for the concession, and so I saw no advantage - and some disadvantages - in coming down to the details sanctioned in Air Offi. C e r Commanding , s telegram No. Z.410 of 20th March. 9. Both Commander Startin and I agreed that friendly relations with the local inhabitants would bs still further advanced if they paid a return visit to the ship, and on behalf of the Commander I issued an invitation to as many as liked to come to visit the ship, where any of them who required medical treatment would receive it. (I had issued a similar invitation the previous' afternnom) Some hesitated, but finally no one would come. I said that both Commander Startin's and my feelings were,much hurt (1) by this display of suspicion. Did they Imagine that after drinking 'their cogfee and eating their dates we mre going to lure them on board and then kidnap themt They protested that no such thought had entered their heads, and some of them informed me privately that the reason why they refusedthe invitation was that any one accepting might be suspected by the others as wishing to come to a separate agreement with us. I mention this incident as showing that though friendly enough - the Islanders are more than ordinarily shy and suspicious, since b .% most Places in the Gulf the local inhabitants are only too pleased to board sloops and see what they can get in the way of medical treatment, cofee, etc. 10. After friendly farewells I then returned to the ship whence Squadron Leader Bentley proceeded on another aerial reconnaissance of the Mahut inlet accompanied by Commander Start in and myself. I returned to Muscat by air on the morning of the 3ist. Sumiaar j of Resu l ts. 11. Though no actual agreement was obtained on the subject of R.A.F. requirements, the trip was by no means barren of results. Unarmed parties landed freely and were well received, personal and friendly relations were estab lished v /ith the local inhabitants and the way smoothed for the visit of aircraft. As i stated in my telegram quoted above I do not think aircraft visiting Umm Rasas by trhem- selves will now be interfered with. This point is of importance as I understand that the new flying boats shortl to arrive at Sasrah could visit Umm Rasas from Muscat and return without refuelling. A good deal of essential inform ation was also obtained as to Umm Rasas by Squadron Leader ^entley who also made two air reconnaissances of the Ma hut inlet. These various results were obtained by close co operation between the Naval, R.A.F. and Political Officers concerned, the presence of H.M .S. 11 Penzance' ensuring a display of force necessary for a first visit, as well as alii ] I - -a —— mm7 . S2) most convenient floating and refuelling base for our various activities. The three intermediaries from Sur also did useful work. Umrri Has a s . 12. Whether Umm Rasas fulfils tte technical requirements of the R.A.P. is of course for the R.A.P. authorities to decide. Prom the political point of view it is certainly much better than any place on the mainland. The inhabitants are inclined to be friendly, and the fact that it is situated on an island makes it safer and less open to the intrusions of raiding parties. For the same reason any pol itical problems connected with the forming of an R.A.F. port of call there are likely to be less complicated. ■' 7 ho * s Who on Masirah. 13. following are the Headmen (Muqaddimeen) of the Island {see para. 4):- 1. Abdullah bin Khamis Taraifi (Fuwaris) of Sur. 2. Salim bin Said Garmeshi (Puwaris) of Dawa. 3. Humaid bin Rashid al Farsi of Safaij. 4.

He would Probably be a useful intermediary on a future occasion. Future Policy. 14. As I stated in my telegram already referred to the getting of the agreement is - in my opinion - now only a matter of time. After another visit or two of flying boats8. &lt;S) the local inhabitants should get accustomed to aircraft, and the question of the agreement can then be taken up. Quite possibly the Islanders will be more ready to agree to buoys and a petrol barge than to an aerodrome. In which case the two former requirements can be arranged for first, and the latter later. r cer I am sending copies of this despatch to the Aj Officer Commanding, Baghdad, and the Senior Naval Offi in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to be.

Dear Colonel, Please refer to your D.0.No:231-S of 1931 regarding the visit of the Rangoons to Masira Island. 2. ..e left Bahrain on the 18th and spent the night at las. There was a high wind but the Eangoons and the Wapiti seaplane I roade it without difficulty,the smallness of the lagoon limiting the size of the waves. 2. Since the visit to ^asira had already been delayed and since the ^naikh was reported to be more inclined to be iriendly I felt it a waste of time to delay the Wapitis a d£y at Yas while we asked the Shaikh if he had objections to the landplanes for I had not the slightest doubt that he would raise objections if he were given an opportunity. I did not anticipate any objection being raised to the Wapiti seaplane,and I felt certain that a sloop was both unnecessary - and undesirable. 3. We arrived at Has al Khaimah next morning,and on arrivil I immediately sent the Eesidency Agent (who had a worried mien) to warn the Shaikh that two landplanes v/ere expected and to bring him over to see me. The Sgaikh was nervous and uncommunicative,but did not make any protest | regarding the landplanes (but refused to go and see themj and he appeared much relieved to hear that they were returning before nightfall. I made some chance remark regarding Bedawin ! I and he immediately seized upon this,said they were a menace ex- | extending their depredations to the edge of the town. He clearly had the land planes in Btigki mind,and if the question of their remaining at Ras al Gonfidenti al . D.0.No:C/62.2. Khairaah for the night is raised lie will undoubtedly make the 'Bedu' an excuse for objecting to them. 4. I accompanied him to his fort to return his visit, and he expanded cousiderably on arriving there. Se were met outside the fort bj some 30-40 of the filthiest bedawin I have ever seen,came,so he said,to have a truce arranged between them. It is unfortunate that it seems to oe my fate to make unpleasent communications to this potentate and then to be obliged the moment be becomes friendly. 5. On our way back from Muscat we received a message in the air from Air Headquarters,Baghdad,which read: Pas a v please ask Prior to kindly caH on our behilf with regard to obtainina- ohaiicn s concurrence m making landing ground 111 it could be explained that pilots found difficulty in locating site 1^1 If possible arrange for work to be commenced iorthwith under Issa'ssupervision.' I went ashore and saw the Residency ^gent and asked him whether the Shaikh had raised any objection to the land machines visit after I had left or whether he had simply accepted it. He immediately produced a letter from the Shaikh to you (which is being sent by this mail) in which he asked to be 'excused' further visits of land planes v and said that the agreement was regarding seaplanes only. The Khan Bahadur said that he was disturbed by the news that pillars had been erected on Tanb (or Abu Musa,I forge which) and considered that there was no liklihood whateve. 1 of his agreeing to marking out an aerodrome,and said tha the only result would be to raise in an acute fora the agreement regarding the flying boats which he has apparently agreed to extend for four months till you from leave. I have not seen the papers regarding the agreement and could not therefore say anything abou IT but after hearing Isa's views and knowing of the@ 3. objections the moment seemed inopportune to raise so delicate a question,and not wishing to risk an alaost certain refusal I decided not to proceed with the matter. I do not think that it is realised how suspicious the inhabitants of this pssi coast are of marks and pillars, the incident at Dubai before the war,and a more recent one at Khassab show how they excite the Arab mind,since it is feared that a claim to territory will follow. To shew the lengths to which this feeling goes I need only say that a few years ago the venerable Shaikh Isa refused to accept a gift of a few iron rails from the Bahrain Agency to mend some culverts because he said that we should then claim the ground! Although I hesitate to venture an opinion on a technical matter,it appears to me that the aerodrome is remarkably easy to find and that with a simple map no one could mistake it. 7. If we can avoid or postpone an actual marking out of land, the aerodrome is to be had for nothing, and if we wish to make use of it the best way will be to suggest hiring a few fidawis to guard the planes when they visit and so meet the Sheikh's inevitable rejoinder that he cannot control the potential danger of the Bedawin. The idea of leasing the land will not occur to the Shaikh,as ■ - ■ - ' ;; ■ Vv _ it is valueless,and i doubt if any unfenced lard at Bas ^ al KhB i mah is considered ss subject to private ownership. If we are to deal with people of this stamp an/understandi ing of their economic viewpoint is essential. 8. The same afternoon we left for Muscat arriving about 5.30 p.m. e waited the next day,the 20th for the second Rangocaa to catch up,and attempted to leave for Sasirah the day after but sere forced back by excessive oil temperature,the day being unfortunately very hot. We left two days later after adjustments to the plane, arriving at iasirah some four hours later. At first4. first sight the island appeared deserted,and after anchoring scarcely a soul could be seen. Welsh and I went off in the rubber dinghy and Bentley followed in another with a bag of rice,or ground bait,as mj colleague at Muscat euphemistically terms it. I could see one or two men hiding behind houses,and it was not until we were leaving the beach that a body of some 20 men sallied out to meet us. We went into their mejlis and sat down and discovered that the so called Shaikh Khamis bin Hilal was on the mainland. The emptiness of the place was explained by many of the inhabitants having gone to the mainland to help i in the date harvest. 9. I could not discover any of the persons mentioned in Fowle's report,and the islanders did not volunteer any information. They were evidently as shy as hawks though one or two were nearly persuaded to come over to the flying boats. The way they all took cover at the distant sight of the aircraft showed that they still consider the® as fraught with unknown dangers and it will be some time before they become accustomed to them. It must be remembered that few of these people have ever seen a European before let alone their mechanical horrors. 10. If I may venture an opinion on Masirah it is this. ii« have here an entirely different problem to Fas al Xhaimah. Here is no puissant Jowasmi with powerful allies but a village of a dozen huts with a Shaikh who makes his living by fishing and protracted negotiations are clearly out of place. The island evidently has as many owners as a suburban allotment,and having lived in glorious isolation since the dawn of history its inhabitants see little advantage and many drawbacks in providing a lime in a present day air route. 11. Masirah is Muscat State territory and there appears little5. little to be gEined by waitiag till these savages are willing to execute an agreement and if a dtow laden with petrol were preceeded by a flying boat I doubt very much that any attempt would be made upon it. Later a barge sight be substituted and once the islanders become accustoaed to aircraft an agreement regarding an aerodrome should be easy to arrange if it is still considered advisable to get thea to sake one. 13.

British Residency, Bushire, the 1st. July 1931. 2nd (Dear Air Vice Marshal), Please refer to rey demi-official letter ^0 .363-3 of the 22nd June 1931. Sometime ago the Shaikh of Baraimi attacked a post gar/L^soned by the subjects of Abu Dhabi, with casualties on both sides. The affair has been simmer ing since, and there is some likelihood of further fighting between rival coalitions,i.e. the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Debai { who belong to the Ghafiri sect) on one side, and the Shaikh of Baraimi helped by Ras-al-Khaimah, Ajman and * Shargah,( Hinawis), on the other.
