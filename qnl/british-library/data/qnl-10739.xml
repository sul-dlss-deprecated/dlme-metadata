They are described as ‘negro slaves’ and are part of the ‘tumburah orchestra’.The word ‘tumburah’ (also: Tanbūr, Tanbura, Tambura or Tanboor) refers to the six-stringed harp-like musical instrument held by the man seated at centre. The instrument is adorned with two fans of feathers and is apparently plucked with the fingers.Four other men sit or crouch, holding various drums between their knees. To the right of the man at centre a man stands, wearing a form of girdle, which is perhaps decorated with sheep’s hooves as described in the 1931 translation of Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje’s
                           Mekka in the Latter Part of the 19th Century: Daily Life, Customs and Learning(pp. 11–12).Although the drawing may have been taken from a photograph, the illustrator has portrayed the faces of the men in a way that makes evident certain nineteenth century racial preconceptions and ideologies.Inscriptions:Printed above image, in ink:XVIIPrinted beneath image, in ink:‘Negersklaven mit dem Ṯúmburah-orchester.’</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023619120.0x000048#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
