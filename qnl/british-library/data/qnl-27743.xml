Dear Mr. Jamali, HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S CONSULATE, MUSCAT, Dated 22nd February, 1947. I have been informed that one Khalfan bin Salim of Sur has come to Muscat to find a purchaser for 5000 rounds of small arms ammunition which he has kept with some one at Quri&amp;t bringing with him only fifty rounds as a sample. 2. You may recollect that about a year ago a quantity of snail arms ammunition was i ecovered by local inhabitants from shallow water off Ras al Hadd where it was dumped by the Royal Air Force personnel at tiie time of the closing down of the Ras al Hadd aerodrome^and I think the ammuni tion now in possession of Khalfan bin Salim is part of the recovered Royal Air Force ammunition. 3. I understand that Khalfan bin Salim who is now in the bazaar intends to return to Sur this evening. Perhaps you could send for him and establish how the ammunition, which is apparently British Government issue, came into his possession. Yours sincerely, Mr. Ali Mohd al Jamali, Secretary to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Muscat. V'FIGS OF THE SECRETARY TO THE SULTAN 0?
