Addressed to Foreign Office; China Station telegram No. 73* repeated to Admiralfv)' a K CLOSURE IN FOREIGN OFFICE COVERING LETTER DATED ?th December, 1935* COPY . (P.7418/923/40) Ho. 395* (17/41/35) Sir, British Legation, Bangkok. 18th November, 1933* n Wyth reference to the second paragraph of my despatch No. 383 of the 12th instant, and to my telegram No. ?6 of to-day, I have the honour to report that I thought it would not be amiss if I expressed to Mr. Dolbeare, the Adviser to the Siamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, my surprise that the naval training ship ’’Chao Phya', on her return voyage from Trieste with the two torpedo-boats now nearing completion there for the Siamese Government, should contemplate paying a visit to the obscure port of irbat, in the independent Arabian State of Oman. In view of the Italo- Ethiopian conflict and all that it implied, I said, Mirbat was situated in a part of the world that was peculiarly interesting just now, and for that reason I could not help wondering what the motive of the proposed visit might be; if refuelling was in view, I could scarcely believe that the necessary facilities existed at such a place. 2. Mr. Dolbeare shared my surprise in this matter, and promised to make enquiries. Yesterday he came to see me with a message from the State Councillor for Foreign Affairs, to the effect that the torpedo boats could not accomplish the stage from Aden to Bombay without receiving fresh fuel, and that irbat had been selected as a convenient point at which refuelling should take place. The fuel would be transferred to the/ The Rt. Honourable Sir Samuel Hoare, Bart., P.C., G.C.S.I., M.P., etc. , etc. , etc.the torpedo 'boats from the 'Chao Phya', and the question of facilities at irtoat thus did not arise; hut the process of transfer could not easily he effected at sea, and for that reason the shelter of a port v/as necessary. The vessels would leave Mirhat again on the same day as they arrived there. 3- Mr. Dolheare went on to thank me for having raised this point, as it was very desirable to avoid any possibility of misunderstanding; he realised that, in view of present ‘ circumstances, a visit of Siamese warships, hailing from the Italian port of Trieste, to an obscure port in Southern Arabia . did call for some explanation, and he had been happy to furnish one. Mr. Dolbeare added the interesting piece of information that Luang Sindhu, the Chief of the Siamese Naval General Staff, now proposes to fly to Port Said for the purpose of meeting the 'Chao Phya' and the torpedo boats there on the voyage out to Bangkok, and of making the situation clear to our own naval authorities in Egypt, if necessary. This seems to be a rather over-emphatic gesture on Luang Sindhu f s part; I suspect that he is really making of the proposed call at Mirbat an excuse for gratifying his desire to accompany the naval craft on at least a portion of their voyage. As I have reported in my despatch Ho. 375 of the 7th instant, it was originally intended that he should proceed to Trieste with the 'Chao Phya', but this idea was ultimately r- jected by the State Council. also 4« I take the opportunity to report/that the 'Chao Phya' will call at Pulo Sebarok, Singapore, on or about 22nd November next for the purpose of refuelling on the voyage to Europe. No such visit was included in her original programme, and I have duly notified the Governor of the Straits Settlements of this alteration. I have, etc., Sgd. J. Crosby. Copies/Copies to The Admiral Comraanding-in-Chief on the China Station: The Chief Commissioner and Resident and Commander-in- Chief, Aden; The TTaval Attach^ to His Majesty’s Legation at Bangkok (at Singapore). P.S. I have just seen Phya Sri Sena, the State Councillor for Foreign Affairs. He confirmed what Mr. Dolbeare had told me about the visit to Mirbat, and said that none of the men from the Siamese ships would be allowed to land there. He also assured me that Luang Sindhu’s object in flying to Port Said was specifically to explain matters to, and avoid any misunderstanding with, our own naval authorities there, and if necessary at Aden also. For the time being this intention of Luang Sindhu was being kept secret, but I should be notified later of the date of his departure. As, besides being Chief of the Naval General Staff, he also holds the portfolio of Public Instruction and is a member of the Cabinet, I promised that I would in due course telegraph to His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Egypt, asking that our naval authorities in Egyptian waters be notified with a view to the rendering of any courtesies that might seem desirable. Although educated in Denmark, Luang Sindhu speaks excellent English, and, as you are aware, though still quite young, he is the real power in the Siamese Navy today. Since the policy of the present Government is to appoint no more officers to flag rank, he holds the rank of Captain. It is perhaps worth recording that, whilst the Siamese Foreign Office is engaged in preparing sanctions against Italy in accordance with the decisions of the League of Nations, the Italian Minister here is on very cordial terms with/with the Siamese Navy Department* As I have already reported, he gave a garden party some time ago in honour Oi. the naval officers who are leaving for Trieste, and I understanci nat he was present at a farewell dinner offered to them at the Ministry of Defence. I am forwarding copies 'both of this despatch and of my previous one No. 3^3 to iis ’l^jesty’s High Commissioner at Cairo. (intld) J.C.Telegram - G.T.C. From - Political, muscat.
