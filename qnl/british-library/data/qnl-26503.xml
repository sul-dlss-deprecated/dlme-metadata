Lord Fassfield proposes to inform the Resident that there is no objection to the continuance of the practice described in his despatch, provided that such letters are confined to purely congratulatory messages on the occasion of special festivals, and that it will not be accessary for copies of these letters to be sent to higher authority.

Colonel Dickson points out that the practice is a harmless one and it is in his opinion desirable to keep it up as it makes for good relations, in the same way as our practice of sending Christmas cards, and is undoubtedly valued by the Arabs, and he enquires whether there is any objection to his continuing the custom and whether there is any necessity to forward copies of such letters of good wishes for the information of His Majesty’s Government and His Majesty’s Minister at Jeddah.3* kj personal view is that, so long as these letters are confined to pnrely congratulatory messages, on the occasions of special festivals, there is no objection to the Political Agent maintaining the previous custom, and that it is hardly necessary that copies of such letters should be forwarded to higher authorities, further 1 consider that such small personal courtesies between Arab notables and Political officers are in themselves desirable, and tend to ■'grease the wheels'’. In view of the terras of the b memorandum however I would solicit your Lordship’s instructions in the matter. 1 have, etc., (Signed) H.V.BIBCOiai. Lt.Col. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. m.

The memorandum has been prepared in consultation with the other interested Departments of His Kgest^s Government and the instructions therein should be regarded as superseding those contained in the memorandum dited the 16th of September, 1929, which was enclosed with my despatch under reference. 3.

The existing instructions on the subject of the channels to be used for communications ^ith Ibn Baud and the Hejaz-Nejd Government are contained in Foreign Office memorandum of 16th September, 19 29, on P. 6189/29 . Save on one point, v, hich is dealt with in the following paragraph, we are not directly concerned in the nroposed revision. It is true that it lays down a procedure to be followed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. But the procedure in question is in respect of matters on which he takes his instructions from the Foreign Office or Colonial Office, and not frcm the India Office or the Government of India. The prrcedure, it may be remarked, appears entirely suitable in the changed conditions of our relations with the Hejaz Government. The point of direct interest to us is the repetition of telegrams and despatches of major importance by the Minister at Jeddah to the Government of India. It will be remembered that we raised this question with the Foreign Office consequent on a note recorded by Sir Denys Bray in connection with the a.ffairs of the Hejaz Air Force As a result, the Foreign Office instructed the Minister 'to repeat to the/of ons it was e the Government of India his telegrams and to send to them direct copies of his despatches on subjects of major importance wherever such action seems to him appropriate'. These instructions were discusse informally with Sir Andrew Ryan on 3rd October. He said that, while his relations with the Government India were excellent, and he already used his discretion as regards the repetition of ccmmunicati to them which he thought might affect them, he was inclined to think that, in so far as Gulf matters v*ere concerned, they should rely principally on the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. He, howeve for his part irr ould do his utmost to keep them in touch, by repetitions, with any developments likely to be of interest to them on the Jeddah side. But frequently difficult, in a telegraphic correspondenc which was fron time to time on a considerable scale to be quite sure at what point, if at all, it was desirable to start repeating telegrams to the Government of India. He suggested, in these m. circumstances, that the instructions issued to hlm7| should be revised on the lines suggested in paragraph 7 of the draft memorandum communicated for our concurrence by the Foreign Office. The Minister’s difficulties are no doubt real, and I suggest that, ''iven good v 'ill, an arrangement on the lines proposed by him is probably ^Kisse:\as we can hope fcr^ooT^ 1 The Foreign Office in paragraph 3 of their letter enquire whether we would be prepared, if we concur in the memorandum, to issue it as an instruction to officers under our control in the Near and Kiddle East \«ho are likely to he concemec!- The/ O Ac &lt;3L+~^l So &lt;v *' CL*} (Ty * j* &lt;X&gt;U 9® «!» U,Minute Paper, Department.

A similar letter is being sent to the Colonial Office, y and a copy is being sent to the Air Ministry. ,2 I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, '*»' — . limn*. i.. jft.ni. i , ,Communications with Ibn -aud and the Hejaz-Nejd Government The creation of a British Lecration at Jedda and the establishment of more normal diplomatic relations with Kina; Ibn ;Saud have necessitated a revision of the arrange ments embodied in the Foreign Office memorandum of September 16, 1929 (enclosed in the despatch No* 198 of the same date to H.te. Agent and Consul at Jedda), which is superseded in its entirety by the present memorandum* 2. It is desired in future to conduct relations with King Ibn Saud and his government as far as possible in accordance with the usual diplomatic procedure. Matters which appear to the British authorities in Iraq, Palestine, Trans-Jordan, the Persian Gulf and elsewhere to require representations to King Ibn haul or his government will therefore normally be referred by the High Commissioners, the Political resident, etc. to the resoective Government departments in London, if they involve questions of policy, J or direct to His ilajesty's Legation at Jedda, if of leaser importance. Copies of despatches sent to London should, save in exceptional circumstances, be sent direct to Jedia and telegrams repeated to that post* Similarly in the case of despatches and telegrams addressed direct to Jedda, copies and repetitions should be sent to London. 3. When reports are addressed to His b^jesty* s Government, the Foreign Office will issue any necessary instructions to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. When they are addressed to Jedda, H*w* Minister will use his discretion as to the form of any representations which he considers he can properly make to the Hejasi authorities without soaking or awaiting instructions from His vajesty'a Government4. The British authorities in Iraq, Palestine, Trans-Jordan, the Persian Oulf etc. may use their discretion as to drafting any proposed representations in the form of a memorandum suitable for transmission verbatim to the HeJaa-Nejd authorities. This procedure may conveniently be followed when the subject matter consists mainly of a recital of facts. In all oases, however, His Majesty’s lniinister will have discretion to use the memo ran ium as he thinks fit. He will also have discretion, if he elects to forward the memorandum, to Introduce minor alterations of lancruap:©, not affecting the sense of the document. 5. It is realised that, when Kins? Ibn Baud is in parts of Arabia remote from Jedda and within easier reach of Bagdad, Amman or the Persian Gulf, cases may arise of such Importance and urgency as to make it desirable that the views of His Majesty’s Government or the British authorities concerned should be conveyed to him by the quickest available means. In such cases the British authorities concerned should reoort to HIa Majesty* s Government by telegram, indicating the reasons for and the nature of the proposed representations. Such telegrams should be repeated to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. 6. In certain cases, e.g. when Ibn Saul has been s in personal relations with British authorities in Iraq, Transjordan or the Persian Gulf, he may possibly address letters direct to such authorities. In such cases the officer addressed should, unless the subject of the letter is of minor importance, obtain, before replying, the instructions of the senior British Representative in the territory concerned, or, in the case of the territories bordering on the Persian Gulf, of the Political Resident, and in all cases, even if he replies without doing this, copies/ ‘copies of the correspondence should be sent through the usual channels to His Majesty's Hovemment and to His Majesty^ Minister at Jedda, It is not desired to encourage communications of this kind; but they may on certain occasions serve a useful purpose# especially if they arise out of personal friendly relations with Kin# Ibn Saud, provided (a) that the matters dealt with are in the main of local interest and (b) that the necessary steps are taken to keep J His Majesty 1 s Government ani His I^Jesty’s Minister at Jedda fully informed. 7. His Majesty's Minister si uhifrae dt Affiilrs a at Jedda will continue to keep the British authorities in Iraq# Palestine, Trana-Jordan# the Persian Gulf etc., fully Informed by despatch or telegram, as the case may be# of all matters affecting those authorities, regarding which he is in communication with the Foreign Office or the Hejaz-Nejd authorities. He will normally leave it to the authorities concerned, more especially the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to supply the Government of India with information, where this may be necessary; but in cases immediately affecting that government or having an important bearing on their interests or policy or requiring decision by therf^# he will communicate direct with the Political and Foreign Department of the Government of India.

I am however adding this personal line to explain that the last paragraph of the memorandum has been prepared as a result of our semi-official correspondence, ending with my letter No. E 3624/2/91 of July 17th, about the repetition of Jedda telegrams etc. to India. You will remember that you discussed the question informally with Ryan when he was here, and I think that the draft paragraph more or less represents what was eventually agreed on. If, however, you feel that it should be altered in any way we can discuss J.G. Laithwaite, Esq.Jr;- V discuss the matter again with Ryan when he next comes to London, which I believe will he tov/ards the end of the month. Yours ever, / rP. 4590/30. PRIVATE.

Ttr e are sending a copy to Ryan for his information and guidance; and we are instructing him to repeat to the Government of India his telegrams, and to send to them direct copies of his despatches, on subjects of major importance, wherever such action seems to him appropriate.

My dear Rendel, I venture to trouble you on tv T c points in connection , .' 7 ith the proposed removal of the Hejaz Air Force to dedda, an in particular the retention oi Pilot Lov^e and the mechanics, Cairns and Gribblo. You have, of course, kept us in close touch with all developments, and! vr e in turn have sent copies of all correspondence to the Government of India. But Bir Denys Bray, who has been '•oing through the papers, is inclined to think tut the ruestion is one of immediate importance to India, in view of the handle for misrepresentation in Moslem India which ^ould be given by any improper conduct on the part of undesirable English airmen in any part of the Hejaz, and he has urged strongly that it is desirable not only to keep the Government of India in the closest possible touch, but that vr e cannot, in the present Indian political situation, venture to take any gratuitous risks, and should not hesitate as soon as opportunity offers to purge the Air Force of its undesirable members. On the first point we have, of course, kept the Government of India throughout in very close touch with what is happening, and no doubt the PoliticalResident has kept them informed of developments and reactions in the Culf. But we would like to suggest that Ryan might be instructed, if you see no objection,to add the Government of India to his circular distribution list in the case of telegrams and despatches of major importance. Perhaps you would let me know whether you think there would be any difficulty about this. So/&lt;7 So far as the undesirable element in the Air Force is concerned, I think that all the Departments who have handled the case at this end are fully alive to the undesirability on all grounds - and not merely because of reactions in Moslem India - of getting and keeping as good, a stamp of man as possible. Ryan's reluctance to be faced lu ith any necessity to make further representations on the subject to Ibn Baud at this juncture is, of course, understandable and re have no desire t r bring pressure on him. But we should like to suggest that the danger of Indian Moslem reactions might again be brought to his attention, possibly privately, in view of the very great importance of the ouestion from our point of vie^ r at the present time. Perhaps he might be asked, to exercise rather special vigilance to ^ r atch, and report on the behaviour of the personnel ' r hen it is collected at Jedda, so that, if unfortunately there should, be signs of any further trouble, any steps that might be possible to prevent or mitigate it could be taken at an early stage in its development. I am sending a copy of this letter privately to Courtney. Yours ever, (Sgd.) Gilbert Laithwaite.Mr. Dalton. Under Secretary ol State, Please see Sir Denys Bray's note of 26th June below. The Government of India have, of course, had. copies of all correspondence which has passed at this end It is now seme tine since it has been thought necessary to address any enquiry direct to them, but it will be remembered that they were fully consulted at an earlier stage when the question of the restrictions to be placed on the employment in a Hejaz Air Force of non-Moslem British personnel ^ ,r as under consideration. rT e are not very clear here as to the steps taken by the Politico 1 Kesident on his mart to keep the Government of India informed of developments,but it may, I think, be assumed that he is in close touch T,T ith them. Prima facie , there seems much to be said for asking the Foreign Office, as Sir Denys Bray suggests, to arrange that the Minister at Jedda shall repeat at any rate his more important telegrams, and they might perhaps be sounded on the lines of the draft which I now suggest. Departments which deal with the subject here that, if only from the much more limited point of view of our relations with Ibn Baud and the maintenance of our prestige with him, it is desirable to eliminate so far as oossible personnel 01 an undesirable character. But ther&lt; is, I suggest, some justification for Sir Andrew Ryan’s present reluctance immediately after the settlement of the Hamilton incident again to face the King with a request for the disnissal of one pilot and t^o mechanics. It will, however, do no harm, I suggest, to mention this point also to the Foreign Office, and if no objection is seen, I might write as in the draft. It is, I think, common ground between the Sgd .)

We have therefore had an amended version I am sending a similar letter to Hall, J. G. Laithwaite, iUsq.,[Thi» Document is the Prop erty of His Britannic Majesty *1 Government.] WITH reference to Foreign Office despatch No. 71 of the 11 th April last, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to transmit to you the accompanying copies of a revised memorandum on the question of the channels to be used for communications between His Majesty King Ibn Saud, or the Hejaz-Nejd Government, and the High Commissioners for Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan, and certain British officers in the Persian Gulf. The present memorandum should be substituted for that enclosed in the Foreign Office despatch referred to above. 2. You will observe that insertions have been made in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the original memorandum so as to cover the question of communications regarding Hejaz-Nejd affairs to and from posts in the Persian Gulf. UNTIL August 1928 communications intended for Ibn Saud were sent through His Majesty’s agent and consul at Jeddah when Ibn Saud was in the Hejaz, or through the Resident in the Persian Gulf (at Bushire) when Ibn Saud was in Nejd. 2 . In August 1928, Ibn Saud requested that this arrangement should no longer be followed, but that in future all communications should be addressed to him through His Majesty’s agent and consul, even during his periods of residence in Nejd. It may, therefore, now be laid down as a general rule that all communications for Ibn Saud shall pass through His Majesty’s agency at Jeddah. 3. The High Commissioners at Bagdad and Jerusalem are authorised to correspond direct with Ibn Saud on matters of detail arising out of the Bahra and Hadda agreements, and such communications will ordinarily be sent through His Majesty’s agent at Jeddah, who will act merely as a channel of communication. In cases of extreme urgency, however, it will still be open to the High Commissioners to communicate with Ibn Saud through the quickest available channel, while sending a repetition or copy to His Majesty’s agent and consul at Jeddah. Communications intended for Ibn Saud will ordinarily be addressed to His Majesty’s agent at Jeddah direct by the High Commissioners concerned, but copies in the case of despatches, and repetitions in the case of telegrams, should in every case be sent to the Colonial Office. 4 . As a general rule, such communications, whether sent by telegram or despatch, will be transmitted textually by His Majesty’s agent at Jeddah, and they should be drafted on that understanding. His Majesty’s agent will, however, have discretion, more particularly in the case of telegrams, to introduce any minor modifications of style or wording which, in the light of his local knowledge, he may consider desirable. It will, further, be open to His Majesty’s agent at Jeddah, in any case where he considers that the proposed communication raises issues of political importance, to refer to the Foreign Office for instruction. Information received from the Iraqi and Transjordan Governments respecting raids on their tribes by Nejdian tribesmen and other minor frontier incidents, or replies from those Govern ments to complaints by the Hejazi Government respecting raids on Hejazi or Nejdian tribesmen and other minor frontier incidents, should, subject to the proviso indicated above, be communicated by His Majesty’s agent to the Hejazi Government, without awaiting the receipt of instructions from London. 5.

The memorandum regarding communications with Ibn Saud proposed to be amended will be found at the bottom of the file, I have inserted in red ink the amendments now proposed.

Further, with a view to clarifying and improving the procedure for telegraphic communication between the Resident in the Persian Culf, the Political Agent at Koweit and the British Agent at Jeddah, I am to suggest that, if Mr. Secretary Benn sees no objection, the memorandum of instructions regarding communications with Ibn Saud dated April 1929 (see Foreign Office letter Mo. E 1768/323/91 of April 12) should be amended in the following manner Paragraph 5. Line 2 to read “Iraq, Transjordan, 'Palestine or the Persian u-ulf posts ' etc. Paragraph 6 . Insert line 2 after 'Palestine' the words ' the Political Resident at Bushire and the ' Political Agents at Koweit and Bahrein '; and in line 3 after 'Foreign Office' the words ' and in the case of Koweit ' and Bahrein to the Resident in the Persian Gulf also' . 3. Mr. Henderson is informed that the Political 4 Resident The Under Secretary of State, 'At India OfficeResident in the Persian Gulf has already been requested to repeat future telegrams dealing with Nejdian questions direct to His Ma«jesty T s Agent and Consul at Jeddah. As the necessary instructions have also been telegraphed to Mr. Bond, it would seem that in the event of Mr. Secretary Benn concurring in the suggestions put forward in the preceding paragraph, there will be no need for the issue in addition of any further instructions. 4.

I AM directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to inform you that the question of the channels to be used for communications between llis Majesty’s 0 overnment, or between the High Commissioners for Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan, and King Ibn Saud has recently been under consideration. 2 . lou will recollect that in the course of the renewed negotiations with Sir G. Clayton in August 192S (see paragraph 22 of Sir G. Clayton’s despatch of the ord September to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, of which a copy was sent to you in Foreign Office Eastern print (Arabia), September 7 , 1928, Section 1 ), the King requested that as far as possible all messages and communications from Iraq, Palestine and Lransjordan should in future be sent through His Majesty’s agency at Jeddah, even during his periods of residence in Nejd. In view of this request, the system hitherto in force, which has not proved entirely satisfactory, has been reviewed; and you should in future be guided by the instructions contained in the enclosed memorandum, which lays down the system which will be adopted until further notice. I am, &amp;c. MONTEAGLE. Enclosure in No. 1 . Communications with Ibn Sand. UNTIL August 1928 communications intended for Ibn Saud were sent through His Majesty s agent and consul at Jeddah when Ibn Saud was in the Hejaz, or through the Resident in the Persian Gulf (at Bushire) when Ibn Saud was in Nejd. 2 . In August 1928 Ibn Saud requested that this arrangement should no longer be followed, but that in future all communications should be addressed to him through His Majesty’s agent and consul, even during his periods of residence in Nejd. It may therefore now be laid down as a general rule that all communications for Ibn Saud shall pass through His Majesty’s agency at Jeddah. 3. The High Commissioners at Bagdad and Jerusalem are authorised to correspond direct with Ibn Saud on matters of detail arising out of the Bahra and Hadda agreements, and such communications will ordinarily be sent through His Majesty’s agent at Jeddah, who will act merely as a channel of communication. In cases of extreme urgency, however, it will still be open to the High Commissioners to communicate with Ibn Saud through the quickest available channel, while sending a repetition oi copy to IIis Majesty s agent and consul at Jeddah. Communications intended for Ibn Saud will ordinarily be addressed to His Majesty’s agent at Jeddah direct by the High Commissioners concerned, but copies in the case' of despatches, and repetitions in the case of telegrams, should in every case be sent to the Colonial Office. 4. As a general rule, such communications, whether sent bv telegram or despatch will be transmitted textually by His Majesty’s agent at Jeddah, and they should be drafted on that understanding. His Majesty’s agent will, however, have discretion, more particularly in the case of telegrams, to introduce any minor modifications of style or wording which, in the light of his local knowledge, he may consider desirable. It will further be open to His Majesty’s agent at Jeddah, in any case where he considers that the proposed communication raises issues of political importance, to refer to the Foreign Office for instruction. Information received from the Iraqi and Transjordan Governments respecting raids on their tribes by Nejdian tribesmen, or replies from those Governments to complaints by the Hejazi Government respecting raids on Hejazi or Nejdian tubesmen, should, subject to the proviso indicated above, be communicated by His Majesty’s agent to the Hejazi Government, without awaiting the receipt of instructions from London.

Communications for Ibti Saud, or regarding Nejdian or Hejazi affairs, from Iraq, Transjordan or Palestine on all other questions should be addressed to the Colonial Office, but repeated, or copied, to Jeddah in every case. In such cases His Majesty s agent at Jeddah will not take official action on the communication until specifically authorised to do so by the Foreign Office. He may, however, if the matter to be dealt with is in any way urgent, take such informal action with the competent Hejazi authorities as he may think desirable. 6 . Similarly, His Majesty’s agent at Jeddah may address the High Commissioners for Iraq, Transjordan and Palestine /direct on points of fact, on matters of routine, or in reply to enquiries, sending a repetition, or copy, in each case to the Foreign Office ;r while on all other questions he will address the Foreign Office direct, sending a repetition or copy to Bagdad or Jerusalem, when either is concerned, and reporting in each case in the body of the telegram or despatch that he has done so.

A large part of the correspondence discusses the drafting and redrafting of a Foreign Office memorandum of instructions, which is intended to revise existing Foreign Office instructions regarding the channels of communication used by British authorities and neighbouring countries to conduct relations with Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] and the Hejaz-Nejd Government. Also discussed are communication arrangements for correspondence not only between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (based at Bushire), the Political Agent at Kuwait, and the Political Agent and Consul at Jeddah, but also between the Political Resident, the Government of India, and the India Office.Most of the correspondence is between officials of the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the India Office, and the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department. Other correspondents include the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Hugh Vincent Biscoe) and the High Commissioner for Iraq (Sir Francis Henry Humphrys).Draft copies of the memorandum (to which further revisions are made following the creation of a British Legation at Jeddah) are included with the correspondence.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Communication</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz and Najd</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000287#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
