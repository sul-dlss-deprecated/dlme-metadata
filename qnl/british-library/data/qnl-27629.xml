J- lor Political Agent, Bahrain.D* 0. No. C/1148. Fhe 29th of December, 1945 My dear pelly, The two gaps in the Agency compound wall caused by the erection of the Resident*s Building are causing me considerable concern, and I have been asking Mr. Qadri, the Overseer, to make gates to close them for the last two months. He always has some reason for not complying. 2. Possibly his reasons are good but, in my opinion, the needs of security over-ride them. As an instance you should know that three drunken Americans raided the Agency a few nights ago but were caught by the British Police before they did any mischief. 3. I consider the matter to be urgent but I cannot get anything done here. As the matter is one connected with the Residents Building I should be grateful, if the Resident has no objection, if you could get orders sent to the overseer to take the work of closing the gaps in hand immediately. Yours sincerely C. J. Pelly, K X S4* j O.B.k., X.C.S., Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e.
