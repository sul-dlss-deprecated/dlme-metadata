The report, which deals with the question of British consular jurisdiction in Persia and the Persian Gulf, was written in order to close a matter that had been the subject of correspondence for over ten years. The report is a narrative of Government of India correspondence dating from 1866 to 1876 on the subject, and covers matters such as: questions over the extent of the territory over which jurisdiction may be exercised; the extent of jurisdictive powers held by the Political Resident, his Assistant, and other officials; implementation of jurisdictive powers; tribunals; legal procedure; civil and criminal law; the slave trade. An appendix to the report (folios 17-18) contains extracts from treatises (most in French) held between Persia and Great Britain (dated 4 March 1857), Persia and Russia (22 February 1828), and Persia and Germany (21 June 1873).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Assistant Secretary to the Political and Secret Department,</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Jurisdiction</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0003d5#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0003d5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
