            otherwise' of developing pearl fisheries in the deeper channels of the Persian
            Gulf.The letter details the political situation in regards to
            responsibility for the pearl banks in the Gulf; past actions taken by the Government to
            prevent British subjects or foreigners attempting to dive on the banks and their support
            of the Arab Chief's in protecting them.The letter also describes the geography of the Gulf
            itself and the distances that shallow waters cover, particularly around Bahreyne
            [Bahrain]; areas where the pearl banks are beyond territorial waters; and hearsay that
            the pearl oysters that wash ashore do migrate from shallower to deeper waters.Pelly goes on to document his concerns that such a
            proposal could set a precedent and that the sudden increase in pearls could disturb the
            market; that it would cause great discontent among the Arab tribes who may view it as a
            breach of their monopoly; the risk of exhausting the beds and costing tribes their main
            industry and giving Pelly's view in conclusion that the Government should
            discourage the intrusion on the arab pearl banks.Pelly also raises the possibility that the
            American's or Russian's could consider embarking on a similar course of
            action; and discussing the question of the Persian Coast and the 'unexplored'
            pearl banks near Karack [ChƒÅrak] as well as the question of whether Persia would defend
            intrusions onto them.The verso of folio 95 also contains several comments
            between Pelly and his Clerk's in relation to the copying of the letter and its
            onward submission.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023876554.0x000038#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
