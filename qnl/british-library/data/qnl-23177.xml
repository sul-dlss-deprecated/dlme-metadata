Captain, Political sxgent, Bahrein.Frora Captain R.G.E.W.Alban, I. Political Agent, Bahrein* To Hie Hon’ble the Political Reeident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, With reference toi^ ray telegrara No. 528 dated June 1927 and your reply telegrara No.645 dated the 5th July 1927 copies attached and marked 'A' and 'B' respectively for easy reference, I have the honour to state that since ray arrival in Bahrein I have frora tirae to tirae been approached by His Excellency Shaikh Haraad and various prominent merchants with regard to the feasibility of installing an electrical system for town lighting and I understand that the subject was first broached nearly two years ago during Major Daly’s tirae. Having had many informal discussions on the subject and seeing that all the raerchants appeared to display great keenness on the subject and asked His Excellency Shaikh Haraad whether he desired to call a meeting of all the prominent raerchants of Muharraq and Manama with a view to sounding them as to their attitude towards such a pufcject and to discuss generally the feasibility of the idea. His Excellency Shaikh Haraad cordially welcomed the proposal and it was arranged that ten members frora Muharraq and ten frora Manama should attend at the Baldiyah offices for a special meeting on the morning of June 27th. Hie meeting accordingly was held under the presidency of His Excellency Shaikh Haraad, I myself attended with the Adviser and raerabers ol the wealthy raerchants of both towns to the total of' twenty wer^ present. HavingHaving opened the meeting, the president commenced by discussing the general desire for general electric lighting in the towns and asked whether. In the event of an Installation being set up, the members present and others of the monied classes would support it by having lifehts and fans laid on In their own houses, the unanimous opinion was that everyone who could afford to, would have S*ectrlclty laid on to his house. The President also raentioned on behalf of the State that lights would be installed in the Customs and at various points on the public Roads and Streets in the Bazaars. Having made sure of adequate support to the scheme the question of finance was next considered. With regard to this subject it was decided that no accurate estimate of the capital required to finance the undertaking could be arrived at in the absence of a reliable consulting engineer and Shaikh Hamad accordingly asked me if I could arrange to obtain the service of a good man to come here at the expense of the Bahrein Government and survey the general situation with the object of tendering an accurate estimate of the expenditure which would be involved. He particularly asked if I would apply telegraphically at the expense of the State in order to avoid delay as much as nossible On the question of funds being discussed ttMM&lt;W'tser stated that the Balediyah had a lac of rupees set apart for the scheme and at this point it was suggested that a Limited fckw Liability Company be formed and shares alloted as follows:, twenty five percent to the BaldPyah, twenty five per cent to the Bahrein State and fifty per cent to be bought by the general public. Thus if the total estimated capital of the Company we 9 to be two lacs. Rupees One lac will be subscribed by the General Public, fifty Thousand by the Balediyah and Rupees Fifty Thousand by the Bahrein State. ?hThe above division was suggested by the members themselves and met with a general assent. At this point it was decided to close the meeting it being impossible to discuss further details in the absence of definite information^ ^ with regard to the expenditure involved. [ ,&lt;1 The scheme itself is sponsored by His Excellency i Shaikh Hamad himself 5 As regards ray own views, I am unable to say whether the scheme will pay and think the Engineer will be able to inform us on that subject. 4s far as the Public are concerned the scheme is popular and meets with general approval, whether or not the fact of Electricity being laid on here would attract outsiders to Bahrein is a doubtful question, however it would go far towards allaying the rigors of the summer for those who are here. I think on the whole Electricity would be a very welcome addition to the State. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant Cantain. Political Agent, BahreinIJ o •3^0-19/121 of 1923.

A copy of the undermentioned paper is forwarded to the Political Agent, Bahrain at Shiraz, with reference to his Memorandum No.C/187, dated the 14th Secretary to the Political -Resident in the Persian '^ulf. Letter No.754/27-E, dated the 28th August 1928, from the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Public Works Department, with enclosure. &lt;y? t A,The proposal of the Bahrein Government was to provide an electric scheme embracing the two towns of Hanama &amp; Mahurrak. ■htie jormer is situated along the shore of the main island extending for li miles with a width of about half a mile. dry at low water with the exception of about 800 feet with a maximum depth of x4 feet, lies the town of Uaharral. 2 . visiting the latter town it was found that the more thicKly populated portion, i« e. the bazar area, was composed one street about mO feet wide, covered through-out similar to the bazar at Ghikarpur, with a number of narrow and winding stieets leading off on the tov/n side averaging 7 to 10 feet wide. 3, xn my opinion the cost of electrification of this town would be incommensurate with thdkxpenditure involved in carrying the mains j- rom Hannmr a distance of approximately miles by means of ovGrjjud and submarine cables, and it is recommended that the extension of the scheme to this town be dropped for the present . 4. The town o~ Ikmama, however, affords a more attractive proposition for a small town supply . The town is encircled by a broad road and provided that due care is exercised during construction, the town as a whole offers no misurmoun o&amp;Dle cii j. ^ iculties .or oveT'ldOJjl transmission, inspite c- the roads through themmd being narrow and winding. The habits of thepnhabitants are such that open windows abutting on the s greets are practically unknown in case where the houses consist of more than one storey, whilst the single story tenementa rarely extend to over 14 feet in height. 5. The bazar area consists of a number of fairly strait though narrow streets, covered over/matting, and cannot he Separated from thid town by a strait a mile and a half broad,^ /7 lowever, ihe bazar is entirely Closed at night and only Polic -tights are necessary* these could be carried out in conduit wiring from the nearest poles of the overhead system./ few fans may perhaps be required and these could easily be arranged ^or o^f the same mains* &gt; . A suitaole plot of land could be obtained for the Power otation either on the present ’Municipal Garden site, or on the outer edge oi the road running from the Palace to the Port. '• soil is for the greater part composed of soft earth for a depth of from 4 to 6 feet, followed b^ a thin layer of coral stone on sandy soil. 3. Y/ater is obtainable by the sinking of artesian wells at a cost of approximately Rs. 2,500 from which a flow of ions per day is available, the water being brackish and charged with magnesia. 9. Unskilled^labour is available at Re. 1 per day, skilled labour such as blacksmiths, carpenters and masons being in the neighbourhood of Rs. 6 per day. 10 . The averge wind pressure is 30 lbs. per square inch. the temperature varying from a maximum of 93 in summer to 55 degrees in the winter months. The humidity is excessive, often recording 125. 11 . It has oeen suggested thut wooden poles obtained locally should be used, but^undersigned inspected the steel masts of the wireless installation and judging from the condition ol these, and the stays used, there appears to be no reason why steel poles should not be used in preference* The wooden poles noticed by the writer both for building and for the telephone wires are badly split. ihe trend the extension of the town appears to be in an Easterly direction and the Municipality would be well advised to bear in mind the advisably of strait roads in a town in which iilectric scheme is to be placed, avoiding unnecessaryunnecessary expenditure in the furturc on electric poles. 13. It would appear that the inhabitants of the town have very little idea of the cost of installing electric installations in their houses and it is feared that the estimate obtained during the stay of the undersigned in Bahrein of ^000 lights and 500 fans, exclusive of the £50 street lights, is somewhat inflated. 14. If the supply is confined to the town of ilanama , it would be possible to install, a 400 volt three phase four wire alternating current system which would be capable of expansion later. ±5. In conclusion therefore it is suggested that- (a) The scheme be limited to the town of Manama for the present. (b) A n alternating current 3 phase 4 wire 400volts system supported by a bearer wire, owing to the construction of movers utilising fuel oil or kerosine which can be obtained from Abadan. figures giving the approximate estimate can be forwarded at a ±ater date if required. be adopted as this would permit of °- sasy expansion iu. necessary to —ahurrak. &gt; . % KC) The method of transmission should he overhead on steel on steel poles with the exception of the Bazar area • -services should be carried in lead covered cable houses • ^e; veneration should be accomplished by means of prime 3d.

Dear Sir, BAHREIN STATE ENQUIRY. With reference to the interview we recently had with you and with Mr. Stevenson, we now have much pleasure In submitting you our estimate for the supply and erection complete of an Electric Pov/er Station and Distribution System for the town of Manana in the Bahrein Islands. We have had the advantage of perusing Mr. Stevenson^ report to you, and as a result of a discussion with him we have put forward a scheme the leading characteristics of which are as fbllows.^ GENERAL . We have examined the location of the town and the possibility of future extensions, and consider that the most suitable pressure at which current should be generating is 3,300 volts between phases alternating. The current would be transmitted from the Power House by means of underground feeders to four sub-stations situated in the town and there transformed to Low Tension current, three phase 4-wire 400 volts between phases, giving a supply pressure for industrial purposes of three phase 400 volts, or for lighting purposes 230 volts to earth. The transmission pressure of 3,300 volts would allow of current to be economically transmitted to Maharaq should this be decided upon in the future, or in a south-easterly direction asC. Dalrymple Belgrava Esq. 8th Octoberf 1928&gt; -2 indicated on Mr. Stevenson*s plan. 1. POWER HOUSE . Generating Sets . We have allowed for two generating sets, ©ach con sisting of a 150 B.H.P. oil fuel driven engine manufactured by Messrs. Mirrlees, Bickerton &amp; Day, of the well known standard designs, direct-coupled to a 100 Kilowatt generator manufactured by the British. Thomson—Houston Company. The engines would be complete with their water coolers, water-piping, fuel storage tanks, ready-for-use fuel oil tank, fuel piping, as set out in the schedule attached, together with a hand- operated overhead travelling crane for use in the Power House. f The lay-out which we propose would be such to allow of the ready extension of the piping, etc. to take an additional 100 kilowatt set should this be necessary in future. Switchgear . The switchgear would consist of a high tension switchboard comprising - 2 alternator panels, 5 feeder panels, 1 synchronizing panel, and 2 field control pedestals and a low tension switchboard comprising — 1 incoming feeder panel, 3 outgoing feeder panels, all as set out in our schedule. Power House Building . We are in telegraphic communication with our Bombay Office on this subject, and we regret that we are not yet in aC. Dalrympls Belgrave Esq. miM AND 8th October, 1928. -3- position to indicate to you the most suitable type of construction. We have discussed with Mr. Stevenson the advantages of brick and stone, but you will appreciate that this is largely a matter of cost and the suitable supply of the right material. In general design, however, the Power House would be very similarly designed to those we have erected in parts of India where the conditions as to temperature and otherwise are not greatly dissimilar from those at Bahrein. We hope to give you further information on this head at a later date. 2. DISTRIBUTION . High Tension . The 3,300 volt current generated at the Power House would be transmitted to four points in the town by means of under ground paper insulated lead sheathed steel tape armoured and served cables and would be there transformed to three phase 4-wire low tension current by means of transformers erected in cast-iron kiosks, which would also contain the necessary low tension switchgear for the outgoing low tension feeders. In addition, there would be a fifth transformer erected in the Power House to give supply to consumers in the immediate vicinity, and to the Power House itself. In all we have allowed for 4,000 yards of high tension feeders as follows - Three core .0225 sq.in. 800 yards. Three core .0145 sq.in. 3000 yards. Low Tension . The low tension distribution would be chiefly by means of bare overhead copper conductors erected on tubular poles with a smaller quantity of four core paper insulated lead sheathed steel tape armoured and served cable laid underground. The total length of distributors, both overhead and underground, is the same as that shewn on Mr. Stevenson 1 s plan, namely - 14,500 yards splitC. Dalrymple Belgrave Esq. - 4 . up as follows - Four core *0225 sq.in* paper insulated lead sheathed, steel tape armoured and served low tension cables, ... 4,000 yards. Overhead distributors consisting of four No. 8 S.W.G. copper wires erected on tubular poles, ... 10,500 yards. Street Lighting . We have examined the schedule of street lights which it is your intention to instal in the town, and we have allowed for these to be fed from the underground and overhead low tension distributors. In the case of the underground distributors each lamp would be controlled by an individual switch fuse on the special pole which would carry the lamp brackets. In the case of the overhead distribution the lamp brackets would be carried on the overhead distribution poles, and the lighting would be controlled by a special switch wire. No. 10 S.W.G. erected below the distribution wires, which would allow groups of lights to be switched on in one operation. The number of street lights allowed for are as follows - Lamps taken from underground distributors 50 Lamps taken from overhead distributors 100. Consumers* Services . It is impossible to forecast accurately the number of services which would be required but for the purpose of the estimate we have assumed the follov^ing figures - Underground services ... 150 Overhead services ... 500 The underground services would consist of a twin •007 sq.in. paper insulated lead sheathed steel tape armoured andG. Dalrymple Belgrave Esq. 8th October, 1928. C°L D -5- served cable complete with 'T n box, cut-outs and single phase meter erected on a suitable board. The overhead services would consist of bare copper wires No. 8 S.W.G. taken from the nearest distribution pole to a house service bracket fixed on the side of the house. The services would all be complete with cut-outs and meters as in the case of the underground services. 3. CLASS OF MATERIAL . Throughout we have allowed for first class material such as we would ourselves instal on the electric lighting schemes which we control in India. We have had experience of Messrs. Mirrlees, Bickerton &amp; Days engines in India since the year 1911, having 12 sets of varying horsepower now under our control. These have given excellent results through many years hard service, and we can thoroughly recommend them. The British fhomson-Houston Company*s material, both alternators and switchgear, are of first class quality, and in this case also we have had operating experience with them for many years past. As regards the distribution, the system of under ground high tension feeders and the mixed underground and overhead distribution which we put forward is one which has been adopted with success in mafay undertakings in India. We would adopt overhead low tension distribution wherever possible. We have, however, allowed 4,000 yards of underground distributors as it is likely that we shall encounter many narrow streets in which it will be difficult to erect overhead wires. Vie advocate keeping the high tension feeders all underground in order to ensure continuity of supply, and we do notC. Dalrymple Belgrave Esq. 8th October, 1928. F lender’s Cable and Construction C°, L d - 6 - think it is necessary to allow duplicate high tension feeders. We are preparing a plan shewing the sites of the transformer kiosks and the routes which we propose for the under ground cables, and will submit these to you as early as possible. The lay-out of the low tension distribution lines would follow Mr. Stevenson's plan but could be amended and extended as local circumstances dictated when we have further knowledge of the load which can be connected. We attach schedules giving particulars of all the work we propose and also a schedule of prices shewing the cost erected in Bahrein. Prices. As regards the price for the Power House you v/ill see we have allowed a round figure of £ 5,000 to cover the cost of the Power House and the foundation of the generating sets. The Power House would be of sufficient dimensions to allow for the erection of a further 100 kilowatt set at some later time, the spare space available meanwhile being used as an office for the engineer in charge, or for stores and for a meter testing bench. The figure for the Power House is provisional as we have stated above, but we think in view of our Indian experience that this figure is very nearly approximate. We have allowed nothing in our estimate for the cost of a suitable site or for making arrangements for bringing a suitable water supply into the Power House, or for a meter testing bench which it may be necessary to instal later. Our prices throughout allow nothing for any customs duty of terminal tax imposed by the State, and if any such taxes are in existence at the time of arrival the cost of these would be additional to &lt;our price.I 4. TERMS OP PAYMENT. We shall be glad to discuss terms of payment with you. it is usual to ask for a payment on receipt of order with a further payment up to 8 G# on the shipment of material f.o.b. London, the balance to be paid when erection is complete. We shall be glad if you will consider this matter and what equitable terms of payment can be made by the State. We trust that this letter and our schedule will be quite clear to you. The undersigned holds himself entirely at your disposal to discuss the matter before your departure for Bahrein, and if any modifications are necessary we shall be glad to go into these with you. We have had much experience in the erection and maintenance of such plants in the East, and shall be very pleased to place that experience at your disposal. We are, dear Sir, Yours faithfully. j lours raithr Overseas Manager. r ’NC. i i -AH HEIN SUMMARY Schedule 1* Engines and Accessories £5,655, 0, 0, Schedule 2, Alternators and Switch- Boards £ 2,935• 0. 0, Schedule 3, Power House Building (approximate cost) £ 5,000. 0. 0.

Tith reference to your letter No, 1939 dated the 16th October 1928 on the above subject, I aia directed by tie government of Bombay (Transferred Department) to state that the approximate cost of the scheme for the electrification of Bahrein as reported by fr.

G.37/18/5176 of the 5 th November 1928, 1 have the honour to state that whilst in England. 1 had several meetings with Mr. Belgrave the Financial Adviser to the Bahrein State and ; various elec trical contractors as a result of which, a quotation was obtained from Messrs Callender’s Cable &amp; Construction Co. for a detailed sheme. A complete specification has been forwarded t&gt;y the firm to Mr. Belgrave at Bahrein at the latter end of Octoher, amounting to £ 27,268-13-2 including erection. 1 am of opinion, however, that if the represen tatives of the firms were prevailed on to visit the town and tenders were called, a very considerable reduction on this figure would result. Owing to the distance of Bahrein from Bombay and the necessary expenditure which would bar incurred in sending a man to Bahrein, firms are naturally disinclined to run the risk of sending a representative up. it is suggested for consideration that all firms tendering be asked to include say £ 100 in the figure for expenses. Si f 1 !$ In the event of three firas tendering, a third of this figure could he paid hy the successful tenderer to each of the others to partly cover their expenses* This aethod, it is believed, was followed in the case of the Calcutta Port Trust or the Calcutta Electric Supply and would result in a very considerable reduction in the * estimated figure of the contract and would thus to a certain ' exoent reimburse the contractors for the expense of the ^ visit of a representative to Bahrein*No 176 of 1929 Tho Political Agency, Bahrein.

Blectrificati*n of Manaa The generating pressure will be 3300 volts between phases of a three phase three wire system. The pres- sure is transmitted by means of high tension under ground cables to Transformer Kiosks where it is trans formed down to low tent ion pressure for distribution of current to consumers. The low tension distribution pressure will be 230 volts between either phase wire and the neutral point of a 3-phase four wire system 60 cycle. The low tension net work mainly consists of 3-phese four wire bare copper mains suitable for a working pressure of 230 volts between phase wire and neutral carried on steel tubular poles and where the streets are too narrow to permit overhead construction, underground mains will be laid.

IrL points and incl. ded a light for 21/8/- Tr\/ 4 -i ~ -i _ 4 . « — j n/a / i s ~v 4 . 19/- for the point and 2/8/- for light. v;hen the Baladiyya asked him for a fig ure for their scheme for ince:sing the use of light and energy*in order to give a round figure he^quoted 2C/-, but as he did not wish to ask people to pay more than they had before he lowered the charge for the light to i/s/- so that the total charge would still be only 21 /8/- • 20/- is of course much simpler for calculations in the loans. One member pointed out that the wire cost more in India than at Bah rain and should therefore be cheaper here. This is possibly correct as our customs dues are lower, but the great cost of wiring is the labour, and the wiremen demand double the pay before they will come, and it is very expensive bringing them. u. e.BAHRAIN GOVERHKSHT STOSIDISED 7/IRIInG SCHSIH 7?

Supposing depreciation on capital £o be 5$ per annum it will be necessary to obtain about Rs. 3300/- revenue, per month, in order to pay for working costs and also depreciation. Only after exceeding that amount of revenue per month will it be possible to say that the scheme is really pajpig its way. If Muharrrak Extension costs another Rs. 60000A of capital outlay which is much more than we hope it will cost anpther Rs. 250/- per month will be required to cover deprec iation on this addditional capital outlay and, say, another Rs. 100/- for additional expenditure on running costs. This sum should be obtainable,from street lighting alone, paid for by Municipality, and the proceeds from private consumers, over and above receipts from Street lighting^should form the first actual profit on the whole Scheme.

Sir, I hevo the honour to draw your attention to the under taking given by you last year that the New Power Station, if placed near the Agency, would produce no noise or smell. I was convinced at the time that it would not be found possible to implement this undertaking and stated that I considered it highly improbable of realisation. The undertaking was, however, renewed and I finally agreed to the site subject to the condi tions mentioned above. 2. It is a matter of common knowledge that this Power Station produces both noise and smell in very disagreeable quantities, and both noise and smell have, as a matter of fact, been noticed as far to the West as the house of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, a distance of nearly a mile. I had remained silent hitherto hoping that I should become accustomed to the noise, but I find this is impossible and, further, I find the easterly winds are more frequent than I supposed and that the nuisance from smell is also a serious factor. In fact the combined nuisance is such that almost all guests who have stayed in the house have remarked on it, particularly the high humming noise generated. 3. The extention of the electrical system to Muharraq will call for greater power from the engine, and both smell and noise will increase. As I do not wish to go down to posterity as a foolish person who thoughtlessly but permanently destroyedthe amenities of this Agency, and as these nuisances are a real source of inconvenience to me, I request that you will kindly take steps as early as possible to carry out your under takings of last year. I have no doubt that you have made these statements bona fide (though I cannot agree that no other site was available) and it ifc probable that you relied upon the statements of Messrs, Callenders representative* I understand that a contract for the extension of the Electric supply to Muharraq is being considered, and I suggest that it should be made a condition of any fresh contract with this firm that they must simultaneously take steps to abate the nuisances that they have already created* I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.No. of 1349 Office of tne adviser to the Government, Behrain.

Sir I have the honour to refer to your letter No:1244/S dated the 9th Shawwal 1349 and to say that I do not consider the assurance of Messrs Callender T s tnat 'they will take up the matter thoroughly with the manufacturers with a view to seeing; that anything reasonably possible should be done to reduce the annoyance complained of' is sufficient ana it should not be accepted. 2. Their Resident Engineer gave a definite undertaking that the Power House would produce neither noise or smell. He was asked to confirm this statement and he did so. It was only on this undertaking that 1 a f ^reed to its present situation, and I believe the Resident Engineer,Mr.Jordan,deliberately gave this undertaking with the full knowledge that the machine would produce noise and smell. You will understand from this that 1 must place little reliance on a vague assurance in general terms. 3. On reconsideration,it appears that nothing can be done to affect the smell,and since this nuisance only occurs when the wind is in a particular quarter I am prepared to waive this objection,though of course,! would be glad of anything that can be done to abate it. The noise of the machine appears to be due to the nature of its construction,so the mechanics inform me,and it is unlikely that the makers can mitigate it in any way. The only recourse will then be to embark on a comprehensive scheme of sound proofing with Cabot T s quilt oror similar sound deadening material,the present thin walls haying the properties of a sounding board. 4. It will be unfortunate for Messrs Calenders that the material should arriye before the matter is decided,but the/ will only have the misrepresentations of their Resident Engineer to thank for the situation the/ find themselves in.

I enclose copies of some correspondence on the subject which will acquaint you with the position. The site of the Power House was only decided upon after I obtained a definite assurance from your Resident Engineer that it would not cause noise or smell. On being given this assurance I telegraphed H.B.M’s Political Agent in India who withdrew his objection to the site. The noise has become a permanent nuisance to H.B.M’s Poli tical iigent, and it is therefore necessary to take effective measures to prevent it or to abate it as much as possible. j • I \ i„ }4» V ■ &gt; h &amp; jr IWt I U iGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. - 2 - I stipulated this in my letter No* nil dated 21st Shaban I consider that the fault lies with your Resident Engineer whose assurance I depended upon as being that Callender’s Cable and Construction Co. to take steps to prevent the nuisance.

What I did say, and still contend is, that the Power Station on its present site would not interfere with the amenities of the .ngency. I quite admit that the hum eminating from the alternators in the Power House is abnormal, and in my letter B/369 of the 13th May 1930 I complained of the hum to our Bombay Office, who acknowledged this letter in their CSBDC?/l5166 da ued 29th May 19o0.

Sir, 7 /ith reference to the recent accident in which three persons were electrocuted by the falling of a live wire on the Sea Road, Manamah, I should be ob liged if you would furnish me with a report on the subject stating whet you consider was the apparent cause of the accident. In this connection I would point out that I ordered an examination of a section of the electric standards and it is found that in the case of a large proportion of them, iron wire, instead of cop- ner wire, was used for binding the conductor to the insulators, and the binding itself was in some cases not adequate, insufficient wire being used to allow for binding over the conductor wire on either sidef of the insulator. The iron wire when removed was found to be so worn out that in many cases it snapped off and sam ples which I have seen are quite brittle. The copper wire on the other hand appears to be absolu tely sound and in good condition. \ ^ *.- 2 - Between the house occupied by the Government Engineer and Kanoo’s building, 22 insulators were found to be bound with iron wire instead of copper. I should also like to know on how many other standards has iron wire been used as it would appear -that the iron wire is liable to snap at any time. T believe I am correct in stating that the use of iron wire for binding copper is admittedly dan gerous owing to the effect of the two metals on each other when in conjunction. Yours faithfully, Adviser to the Government.Bahrain,the 11th January 1932. Bear iarke, You will remember that while you were acting for Belgrave, 1 you and ^teele had a conversation with me regarding the electric , lighting engine and my objections tofhe noise it created. iou were anxious that Jordan should leave as soon as possible for various reasons and his departure was being held up for the fact that GallenderS wished him to install a sub stitute for the part that created the noise. In fact they did not intend that he should leave Bahrain until the complaint regarding the noise had been rectified. In order to meet you, Ijfagreed to withdraw rny objections regarding this noise on the conditions that Steele would install the second transformer or whatever it was that required to be done and also that the State would,if required,line the walls of the power house with sand bags or other sound-deadening material and also,if required,build a wall in front of the door,which, as I found out,was never shut although I had frequently been assured that it would he. As you are going on leave I should like to have something on record about the sound-deadening of the v/alls and also regarding the construction of a wall in front of the door, • should it still be found necessary when the second transformer has been put in. Gould you please let me have something showing this which I could produce to Belgrave if and when required. I think I told you at the time that I had given up my objections to the smell not because it was no longer annoying but because it is apparently impossible to rectify it. *-ain L.S.Parke, mandant of Police, Bahrain.received q v , V3 mi932i&lt; % 0 OahrM^ (I* The Port. /TTqn Bahrain.13th.Jany.1932.

This was a similar failure to the previous one in November 1944 which caused the shut down of No.I Generating Set for a period of 51 days while certain repairs to the compressor wore carried out by BAPCO. 2. Owing to excessive connecting rod big end knocking, No.2 Generating Set was shut down at I2.0clock on 5th Aug st,I945 and after cooling was opened up for inspection. This revealed a failure of the white metal lining of No.I big end bearing and it is evident that the iwnodiate shut down has prevented a more serious failure. Repairs are in hand but they cannot be finished in loss than 10 to 12 hours, i.e. before 10.30 p.m. it will therefore be necessary to shut off Jufair Feeder at 7.0 p.m. until about 10.30 p.m. when either the normal reduced load or the completion of repairs to No.2 set will be completed.
