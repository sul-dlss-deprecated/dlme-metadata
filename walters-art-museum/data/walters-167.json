Countless variations have been preserved, differing in design, size, and material, but always associated with eternity and regeneration. Some special scarabs have human or ram heads (the emblem of the god Amen-Re) joined to the body of the beetle. Others, called scaraboids, have the body replaced with that of another animal but retain the general oval shape. Rarer items are decorated beads, which were part of precious necklaces. Some show a palm tree surrounded by monkeys, symbolizing the daily rising of the sun god.\r\n", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/6355", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, [date and mode of acquisition unknown];  Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "18th-19th Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.627", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.382_TopVwA_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.382_TopVwA_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.382_TopVwA_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.382_TopVwA_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.382_TopVwA_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1295119, 1435420, 1437422, 1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2172, 2513", "Images": "CUR_42.382_SideA_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.382_SideB_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.382_TopVwA_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.382_TopVwB_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.382_TopVwC_DD_RS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
