The memorandum is a statement, given by an anonymous source, about the Sherif [Shereef] of Mecca, Hussein Ibn Ali [Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī]. The statement describes: the Sharif’s origins, character, political views; his attitude to and standing amongst Arabs, Turks, and Europeans; his household, including his sons; his enemies at Mecca, including Sayed El Idrissi. Symes’s introductory note describes the extent of correspondence in political views between Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī and his son, Ali bin Hussein [‘Alī bin Ḥusayn].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Hejaz Ḥusayn bin 'Alī al-Hāshimī</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Hejaz 'Alī bin Ḥusayn al-Hāshimī</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000224#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
