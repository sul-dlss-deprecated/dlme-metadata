No. 57 - S. PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. the 7th January, 1947. V It has been suggested to me by more than one person that in view of the large amount of shipping now visiting Bahrain we ought to endeavour to establish a Seamen's Club and Hostel at Sitra or f . . iwanamah. Ihe Mission^ to Seamen would probably be willing to assist and the Bahrain Petroleum Company might be asked for a contribution. , ^• would you kindly let me have your views on the proposal and if you support it suggest the best means of putting/ it into effect.

I should be grateful for any com ments you may have to make at an early date. ' Subject to anything you may have to say I am thinking of calling a meeting consisting of yourself, Belgrave, Russell Brown and Meikle, to consider what exact ly we should pi’ess for before I write to the India Office. Lieut. Colonel A.C. Gal Political Agent, Bahrain.NOTES ft .V), The Bevd. Mr. BrB. White, British Chaplain, Basra and the Persian Gulf and Port Chaplain. Mission to Seamen, came to.see me on the Slst January and discussed the proposal for a Seamen's Club and Hostel here at considerable length. H© said that ii the Mission to Seamen were to establish a Club here they would wish to have their own Chaplain in charge. The whole question will be greatly simplified if the proposal 'to maintain an Anglican Chaplain at Bahrain comes to iruition as it would be possible for him to take cnarge ox the clubs in addition to attending to his parochial duties. ° BapC0 ^ imcie;rs ' tarid are not greatly interested m the matter at present as they own none of the tankers visiting Sitra, but in a few months time they are to have a tanker fleet of their own, and will then be willing to contribute to the unkeen of a Seamen's Club at Sitra.' A club consisting of only one or two rooms with books, games, &amp;c., would be fairly easy to maintain and run but some kind of hostel 'is also required to house seamen who are unable to leave Bahrain with their ships owing to illness or for some other reason. Sueh a hostel will reouire careful supervision and management. Mr. White is shortly proceeding to the United- Kingdom on leave and will take up the whole question of the establishment of a Seamen's Club at Bahrain with the Mission to Seamen in London. It is likely to assist matters if this Besidency can move the India Office to address the Mission to Seamen offi cially on the subject. I understand that Europen crews frequently come here after three months or so at sea^and are greatly disappointed whe£ they find they are not allowed to land and that they cannot even purchase odd things (e.g. shaving-soap) vtfiich they require. Bapco might perhaps be moved to allow the opening of a shop on Sitra wharf.D.O. Ho.C/172 The 10th of February, 1947. - Dear Colonel Hay, Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No.307-33/12, dated the ? February, 1947, on the subject of a Seamen’s Institute in Bahrain? 2. This question has been a subject of discussion in the past, but no conclusion has been reached since, in my opinion, the most practical way an institute can be established is for BAPCO to build one. They have budgetted in the past for a small building, but the money that can be made available is not sufficient for more than a few rooms which, if the institute Is to be successful, is not adequate. It is difficult for me to take the matter up with BAPCO since the majority of the ships calling at Bahrain ply under foreign flags, and I am not directly concerned with the welfare of their crews. When BAPCO have their own fleet of tankers, as possibly they may do, it will be up to them to provide suitably for their seamen. It Is not only a question of a building but one of staff, both European and native, commissariat, and the Company can hardly be asked to import for persons other than their own employees. 3. As Political Agent T would come into the picture as responsible for the working of the Order-in-Council, and if BAPCO were to build an insticute I should expect them to approach me and to inform me that they were opening an institute which, from its nature, would be available to all seamen. The men should be admitted to a club compound in the BAPCO concession area and supplied with accommodation, food, drink and other amenities. This, I should consider agreeable since the men would be in controlled parties. 4. * If the men are allowed to roam at will over the island, I should certainly not welcome an institute since it would be bound to bring with it complications involving public security. I know from experience in Bahrain that many of the seamen in ships calling here are of a rough type and difficult to handle. Their presence would bring in its wake problems of jails, police, Importation of drink, sexual immorality such as were experienced when troops were stationed on the Island. While all this would be offensive to the Shaikh the solution of these unpleasant problems would devolve on his Government and the Agency Courts. At the present time neither is suffi ciently equipped. /5. From the The Hon’ble Lt-Col. W.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.s* « - 2 - 5. From the charitable aspect, one would like something to be done, but if the Missions to Seamen wish to move in the matter they should approach the Bahrain Government through me, since from the wider point of view the problem is primarily one for the port and not the Oil Company nor the politicals. At Abadan there is a Mission supported by the A.I.O.C. but then that port is used solely by and for the Oil Company which is not the case here. (At Basra the institute is supported by the port). The Mission to Seamen could, of course, approach BAPCO if they pre fer in an endeavour to establish a combined institute which would follow the lines suggested in paragraph 3 above. 6. The suggestion that the Mission should share the services of the proposed Anglican chaplain for Bahrain is a little premature. White might be reminded that what has been done in the direction of obtaining a chaplain for Bahrain has been by lay sub scription and the effort of individuals. The Church Committee has that matter in hand, and may see objection to the appropriation of their chaplain by the Mission. If after' the chaplain is established he finds he has time to give to the Mission so much the better. Or again if the Mission will provide funds to enable anglicans In Bahrain to establish a chaplain then, of course, a proportion of his time would be devoted to Mission work. Or again if the Mission can provide a clergyman to whose stipend the Bahrain Church Fund could contribute he would have to divide his time between the two duties. yours,sincerely, NS.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00007a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1387</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00007a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1387</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 12/17 Seamen’s Club and Hostel, Establishment of: Correspondence re:’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1947/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-10-01T21:03:48</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (7 folios)</extent><extent>The file’s contents are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.
