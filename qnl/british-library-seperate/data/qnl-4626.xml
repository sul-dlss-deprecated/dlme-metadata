The papers include multiple copies (approximately sixty-eight) of a circular letter from the Political Agent (Cornelius James Pelly), that includes a quote from a speech made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Ernest Bevin) on 20 February 1948, and information about the Lord Mayor of London’s appeal for funds for the UN Appeal for Children. Copies of these letters were sent to members of the expatriate (British, European, American) community in Bahrain, with the aim of raising subscriptions for the fund. The file includes numerous demi-official and personal letters from Bahrain’s British and United States commercial concerns (for example, the Bahrain Petroleum Company, Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Company, Cable and Wireless Limited), as well as from individuals, with details of monies (expressed in Indian rupees) pledged. Copies of Bevin’s full speech, given at Mansion House, London on 20 February 1948, are included in the file (folios 4, 12-14).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Child welfare</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>United Nations</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Charities</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000141#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000141#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000141#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000141#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
