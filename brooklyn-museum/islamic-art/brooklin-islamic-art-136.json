The combination of kaf-mim does not seem to make any sense, nor is it possible to establish a meaning by assuming that certain letters have fallen out. However, the combination 'mim-kaf' could be derived from '(al-) mu(l)k (illah), more specifically, the Arabic word 'mulk,' with the center 'lam' omitted. The weaver must have copied this from a correctly written version, but he rendered it then in mirror writing and leaving out the center letter. A further development...the combination 'kaf-mim' which, though written in the ordinary fashion, is nevertheless a reflection of an incorrect version. In addition, there are additional letters which float around in the inscription or above it, without, however, affording any clue as to what they ordinarily might have been combined with or stood for.\"\r\n", "credit_line": "Anonymous gift", "copyright": null, "classification": "Textile", "public_access": 1, "approvals_mask": null, "copyright_restricted": 0, "visible": 1, "date_added": "2010-03-10", "highlight": 0, "primary_image": "57.120.3_PS1.jpg", "section": "", "museum_location": {"id": null, "name": "This item is not on view", "is_public": 0, "is_floor": false, "parent_location_id": null}, "rights_type": {"name": "Creative Commons 3D", "public_name": "Creative Commons-BY", "description": "You may download and use Brooklyn Museum images of this three-dimensional work in accordance with a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons license</a>.
