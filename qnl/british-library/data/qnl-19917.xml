In it there is some matters which are not hidden rrom your nobility and I think ohat the object of it is of no imnortance to the Sultan. (2) I draw /our kind attention to what you have written in your letter mentioned above about the police in Bahrain. Anyone who looks at it perceive at the rirst instance that the Sultan has objected to the formation of the police from the Persians and the disappointment of the Najdis and Sunnis from enlistment as you have said and the fact that the Sultan objected to the fanaticism of the police to their own kind by joining the Persians who were from their own kind and by firing arms on the ilajdis only. ^3) xhe following was mentioned in Art 2 of the conditions imposed by 'lour Excellency on the Agent of the Sultan. ' He Should solemnly undertakes to confine his activities to purely commercial ends and the private affairs of Your ^i, !r ) hne8s It is obvious that the private affairs of His Highness the Sultan is different to the official affairs and the latter is the one which is concerned to the ■ L olitical A gent of the British Government at Bahrain and that cannot be oftenly except by His Highness* agent. Moreover it is obvious also that the Sultan is not a merchant and his relations with the Great Britain is political the more of it is commercial If I do not say to be or pure political. If we consider this, how it would be lawful to us to strip the Agent of His Highness the Sultan of his official form and consider him as a commercial one only, because it is certain that he will be the official not private bearer between Gi eat Bx'itain and His Highness in receiving the officail5^ X official dospatohas from both oides and in delivering them, unleaa it is desired that'he should be deprived of his deliver ing the official letters of the Sultan to the Political Agent of the High British Government in Bahrain and taking their replies and this V7ill cause delay in the official communications between the Government of His .Majesty the ^ing and His Highness the oultan which are too much and both parties cannot do without it# I observe that the matter in Art 3 which you say is refused their by the Gx-eat Britain and do not correspond with HJif/policy at Bahrain is sufficient for confining the duty of the Agent under reference and spoiling most of the rights v/hich is due lo a Political Agent. And if we carefully look at the contents of Art 2 we will see that Art 3 contains most of it if wo excluded the phrase ^ the private affairs of the Sultan H which has no % concern in the question existed between the two parties. Thereforef I deem it advisable to remind Your Excellency that the recording of Art 2 is not without roughness and while Art 3 contains its subject its record would be of no use. (4) i ? or the reasons that I have described to Your Excellenc afeoub Art 3, under these conditions, I see that the wording of i your conditions to the Sultan's agent that has been mentioned at tho end of Art 3, that is ' the private concerns of -^our Highness' should be changed into 'the official concerns of Your Highness**. t V5) [ have some proposals to make to Your Sxcellency which may be a means for satisfying your friend His Highness the Sultan and that would not touch lihe interests and the policy of the Great Britain but in the meantime will be a cause for the | removal of misunderstanding and a basis on which the old friendly t relations will be laid down and by this small satisfaction its strenght will be increased. The following are the proposals. (a) Iluhammed Sherif should be prevented from interference iitthe police affairs. He had acted fanatically fomerly and recently against the Ha.jdis and had imprisoned and beaten some ot them without any legal a eason and by his joining the Persians in the riot which occurred recently at Bahrain and his fanaticism in it, the door of the disturbance will remain open as it is and 1and his fanaticlata would make an effoc^on your friend, the Sultan, and undoubtedly lour Sxcellenoy will realise the difference between the two if we are permitted to compare between them. ^b) 'i'be Agent of the Sultan should be allowed to ^ive the paseDort provided that he should not si&amp;i himself and should not mention his name in it but the passports should be sent to him by ohe Sultan under his own signature and the Agent should only write the description of the passenger and what it necessary, i ! ne bearer of the passport should go to the Political Agency of the ^eat Britain at Bahrain for countersignature when he intends to leave. Those who sails by boats from the norts for instance as Jabail which owing to their detention at Bahrain delay may occur in their commercial affairs especially ir the v /eather is unfavourable to their sailing crafts are exempted from this, that is, from going to the Political Agency. ^c) The Sultan's Agent should be Abdol Aziz A1 ^asaibi instead of Abdollah A1 ^asaibi who will return to Bahrain for attending to his commercial affairs only. ^our Excellency These are the considerations and the proposals which I see the advisability of making light of it and its execution in full. They are very small ancL difficult and would not in the least touch the interests and the policy of the Great Britain and its future good result is not hidden. I do not consider it too much for the British Government to do so especially when I remember that the one for whom the counnivance is wished is a sincere friend and a loyal confederate whose laudable positions and his confirmed sincerity to his great friend would give evidence. Your ILxcellency should perfectly know what nronrnted me to write these lines is my great desire for the removal of that effect which was occurred by the actions which were taken on account of the recent riot in Bahrain and for the strengthening the friendly relations which I believe you are heartily desirous of it personally.
