From—C olonel F. A. 'W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of correspondence ending with my letter No. 22 of the 13th April, I have the honour to forward a letter No. 86 of the 10th April, from the Political Agent at Muscat, discussing the situation as left by the recent revolt against the Sultan with its accompanying state of war, and the results to which it may lead; and submitting certain considerations on the course to be adopted, in order to the security of our interests in the future. 2. Major Sadler, after clearly describing the topographical distribution of tlie tribes, shows that the Sultan's power is very limited in extent, and that the attempt to strengthen and extend it by a system of money pay ments has been utterly useless, resulting only in impoverishment. Still Seyyid Eeysul's position, though weak, need not be regarded as altogether hopeless, and the support he lately received from a large body of his people mi^ht be turned to good account. Though loyal however, he is described as having shown himself obstinate in regard to advice, and notwithstanding the rude awakening he has had, a radical improvement in his control of affairs cannot confidently be looked for. In any case. Major Sadler considers that we cannot rely upon the Sultan alone for the protection of our very important interests in the towns of Muscat and Mutrah, in which the wealth, commerce, and property are principally in the hands of British Indian subjects. In this view I am disposed to concur, as also in the further opinion that our recent strict neutral ity h aving d issipated any idea that might have existed among the tribes, that our support would be given to the existing authority, further troubles are by no means unlikely. 3. To guard against the risks of this critical position it is proposed— to annex Muscat and Mutrah, which would practically involve an extinction of the Sultanate, for no reasonably stable base for it, in the disturbed interior, would be possible; (2) to declare a protectorate over Oman. Either of these measures would be of grave moment, and would require a preliminary withdrawal from our convention of 1862 with France, and I feel some hesitation in expressing my opinion upon them. After careful consider ation, however, I am disposed to favour the second proposal as promising to be less onerous and embarrassing than the other, and equally efficient to secure the object aimed at—protection for the valuable interests which we have at stake. 4. I agree with Major Sadler in the belief that a protectorate would be welcomed by the people generally, and probably also by the Chief, who could hardly lail to see in the support which he could secure, by conforming to our advice, a means to the increased stability of his rule. In the existing local and political conditions, there seem also to be several which would be very favourable to such a measure. Interference in the affairs of the interior would be quite unnecessary and could easily be avoided, the tribal life of the Arabs, with its incessant unrest, being matters which would not affect the important interests at the ports. Even here, the influence of the Saltan, more judiciously exerted under our advice, should occasion to offer it arise, would doubtless have a valuable effect in allaying inter-tribal diffi culties, and a gradual amelioration of the constant strife, which has for ages been the normal state, would follow. Muscat and Mutrah are practically independent of the interior which, in its turn, depends on these ports for most of the necessaries of life, as well as for the export of its produce in exchange for those necessaries. These towns would thus, for all practical purposes, command the interior, and would at the (1) 5)same time be easily secured against any aggression from it. The volume of their trade is very considerable, and may be taken as the measure of the in fluence for good, which the authority controlling it could bring to bear on the peoples inland. And a most favourable circumstance of the situation is, that the external relations of Oman being for all practical purposes confined to British India, and in much minor degree, Zanzibar, no complications from a collision with Foreign interests would be likely to arise. 6. Should wider considerationsof Imperial policy be opposed to the entertainment of the views above discussed, some such safeguards against the risks to which our important interests in property and commerce are exposed, as are sketched in the concluding portion of Major Sadler's letter, would seem to demand the attention of Government. No. 86, dated Muscat, the 10th April 1895 (Confidential). From— Major J. Hayes Sadler , Political Agent, Muscat, To — C olonel F. A. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In your letter marginally noted you reported to Government on the pro- Paras. 8-11 of letter No. C., dated the 21st March, bable result, SO far as it COuld be foreseen from the Political Kesident to the Foreign Secretary. 0 f the recent rebellion as affecting the authority of the Sultan and the prestige of his powerful adversary, Sheikh Salih. I now venture to make a few observations on the political situation in Oman and the considerations which would guide us, should it be in contempla tion to effect a change in our policy towards the country and its ruler. And I would preface these remarks by respectfully expressing my entire concur rence in the views you have expressed in the paragraphs above noted. 2. Eor present purposes Oman may be divided into three portions : (a) The Sharkiyyeh and Jaalan. (£&gt;) The Dhahirah and the Batinah. (&lt;?) The Ilajoor and Oman Proper. {a) In the Sharkiyyeh, which is mainly peopled by Hinawi tribes. Sheikh Salih is the dominant spirit, held in check in a manner by the Ghafiria of that district and Jaalan. In Jaalan the power is pretty evenly balanced between the rival Hinawi and Ghafiri tribes, the Chief of which, the Beni Boo Hassan (H) and the Beni Boo Ali (Gh) are constantly at war with each other.' The Sultan has no voice in the affairs of the Sharkiyyeh or Jaalan. {b) The principal tribe in the Dhahirah is the Naim (Gh), which is under the influence of, and held in check by, the Chief of Aboo Dhabi, who is on good terms with the Sultan of Oman. So far as Oman politics are concerned, this and the other Dhahirah tribes may be said to be independent. Fiom Muscat to Masnaah in the Batinah the Sultan exercises authoritvj thenceforward to Sohar, the inland tribes are under the influence of Seyyid Ibrahim bin Kais, backed by his old allies, the Yal Saad, the coast towns bein^ in the possession of the Sultan. (c) lhat portion of the Hajoor which comprises Semmayil, Nakl, Tao and the adi Muawal, and which is peopled by Ghafiris, is more or less under the control of the Sultan, who has an able official, Sheikh Rashid bin Uzaiz, to look after his interests in that quarter. Political influence in Oman Proper is divided between the Ghafiris of Bailah, the Chief of whom is the Taminiah of the Ghafiri clans, and the Hinawis of Nezwah, over neither of these does the Sultan exercise anv authority. 3 3. It will thus be seen that the Sultan's direct authority is limited to that portion of the Batinah between Muscat and Masnaah and its coast towns, 23 and is exercised in a measure over the tract of country round Nakl, Tao, the Wadi Muawal and Semmayil. The latter is important, as from this valley lead the passes into 'the Sharkiyyeh and Oman Proper. Even here the Sultan has lost ground, his policy of non-interference having alienated some of the Ghafiri tribes and brought them more within the influence of Sheikh Salih; last autumn they were dissatisfied at their disputes being referred for settlement to that Sheikh, and it may be owing to this unfortunate policy of the Sultan's that we find Sheikhs of the Rahbiyeen and Nidabiyeen, the two Ghafiri tribes holding the principal passes, in co-oper ation with Sheikh Salih in his attack on the Sultan. 4. It is not necessary for me to repeat history and recapitulate the causes which led to the power and control exercised over the tribes of Oman by Seyyid Saeed and his son Seyyid Thoweyni passing from the hands of their successors, till we come to the position sketched in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this report. Suffice it to say that the situation now is not so bad as it was in the worst days of Seyyid Turki. The Sultan has not taken advantage of the unusually peaceful state in which he found the country on his accession to consolidate his power, his rule has been weak, and he has tried to avert the hostility of some of the tribes and enlist the good-will of others by a system of cash payments, which would break a far longer purse than his without producing any permanent result. The Arab is only to be controlled by two agents —force and money—the Sultan unable to employ the former had recourse to the latter, and the more he gave the more was asked. The uselessness of this system of what passes for Government in Arabia was fully shown in the time of the late Sultan Seyyid Turki, whose liberal donations to the tribes exhausted his resources, but failed to secure their fidelity. 5. The Sultan's position, however, weak as it has been shown to be, is not altogether hopeless. Large reinforcements mustered to his assistance in his hour of need, and though they may have answered the Sultan's summons more with a view to thwart their Hinawi rivals than to actively support their ruler, yet the passive resistance they offered was quite enough to show Sheikh Salih' that the object of the rebellion could not be attained, it forced the rebels to come to terms and unquestionably saved the Sultanate. This, as you have remarked, is a force which, if judiciously used, might be turned to great advantage. There are also dissensions amongst the Hinawis, of which the Sultan is well aware, and of which I am advised he will not be slow to take advantage. I may mention two instances :— {a) The jealousy between Sheikh Salih and Sheikh Saeed bin Ali. One of the causes of disagreement between the Sultan and Sheikh Salih was the favour shown by His Highness to Sheikh Saeed, Sheikh Salih rightly or wrongly thinking the Sultan was trying to subvert his influence with the Harth through this Sheikh. {b) The ill-feeling which the Hijriyeen bear towards the Harth on account of the larger presents received by the latter from the Saltan of Zanzibar, which the former attribute to the influence of the U arth and more especially of Hilal bin Aamir with Seyyid Hamad bin Thoweyni; the fact being that the Hijriyeen Sheikhs arrived at Zanzibar after the Sultan had received a caution in the matter of these presents. Moreover the Hijriyeen show a tendency to revert to the Ghafiri faction to which they originally belonged. There is also the fact that Sheikh Salih must to a certain extent be dis credited by the very treacherous and underhand manner in which his late attempt on the Sultanate was made; and also in a manner by the fact that the rebellion failed to gain its declared object, though in this last respect it must be observed that Sheikh Salih has made many unsuccessful attempts on Muscat without losing much of his prestige thereby.4 6. Weak ruler though Seyyid Turki was, he threw in his lot entirely with us, he relied implicitly on the British Government, and in his allegiance to it he never wavered; and it is to the support afforded him in recognition of these friendly and loyal feelings that he owed in a great measure the main tenance of his position and his throne. 7. I fear quite the same cannot be said of the present Sultan. His loyalty has never been questioned, but since the early days of his rule he has shown a disinclination to regard advice tendered him in an amicable spirit from this Agency by my predecessors and myself in the same light of con fidence as his late f ather, whilst his attitude in connection with several matters affecting British interests has been neither reasonable nor altogether friendly. 8. This may partly be attributed to ignorance, and a tendency in his disposition to pride and self-conceit which leads him to take his own lino regardless of the opinion of those who are willing and able to give him good advice. The fact too may be borne in mind of the easy circumstances under which he succeeded to the Sultanate, and the absence during his reign until lately of those troubles, which were so marked a feature of Saiyid Turki's life, an ex perience of which might perhaps have taught him the necessity of better appreciating our friendship and assistance. , &gt; 9. I have long thought that some lesson was needed, and this has come in the most sudden and violent form. He has seen his capital occupied by his enemies and our assistance, freely given to his father, though under somewhat different circumstances, withheld. Whether late events will have effected a permanent change in the Sultan's attitude it is too early yet to say; I can only express my hopes that it may be so, and add that I have noticed favourable indications of a desire to draw closer to us. 10. But the fact which I wish to bring prominently to the notice of Government is that, be the character and attitude of the Sultan what they may, the political conditions are neither now, nor are likely to be in the near future, such as to warrant our depending on the unaided efforts of the Sultan for the protection of our interests in the towns of Mutrah and Muscat. I mean that, if our subjects are to remain in these two towns and carry on their business with security to their persons and property, and if we are to preserve the local trade with India, a policy of neutrality on the next occasion of a rising against the Sultan's authority will probably fail to secure these objects. 11. I have already observed that it was mainly to the active support afforded by us to Seyyid Turki that he was able to retain his position and his throne, and I consider it to be mainly owing to the belief of the tribes that this support would be continued to his son that Seyyid Feysul owes until lately almost uninterrupted immunity from attack since the commencement of his reign. 12. But this safeguard exists no longer. Our attitude of inaction which, political considerations apart, was forced on us from the outset of the rebellion by the fact of the town falling at once into the possession of the rebels, practically gave them a free hand in their attempt to seize the Sultanate, and will encourage them to take the same view of the situation in future attempts, if our abstaining from coercion has not led them to think we were tacitly on their side. We cannot yet surmise what the after effects of the rebellion will be, but I think it may be anticipated that, under present conditions, Oman has* not before it a period of rest; indeed it would not be safe to predict that the next few months will pass without further trouble. And when another rising takes place, as some time or other it will, we cannot afford to have a repetition of the incidents which marked the late rebellion.•v A ■ W / Experience has shown that the Bedouin cannot be restrained for long from pillage and plunder, and once inside the walls there is almost as much to fear from friend as foe; the Sultan is unable to control his allies, the rebel leaders their followers, the chief object of an Arab war being to make off with as much plunder as each side can secure. 13. The remedy for this unsatisfactory state of affairs would, I submit, be found in a change of our policy towards the country. If the present be thought a fitting opportunity for withdrawing from the Convention of 1862 with Erance, two courses would be open :— {a) To annex Muscat and Mutrah and pension the Sultan. This is such a radical measure that perhaps it need not be seriously considered in this letter. The result to us would be that we should gain a naval position which we practically command already, but with this advantage that we should be able to put it in a proper state of defence, secure the harbour and anchorage and command the trade of the country; in fact create a Persian Gulf Aden. To the Sultan it would mean the loss of the Sultanate, for, without the walls and forts of Muscat, he could not rule Oman for a single day. The country would fall into two divisions—one ruled by _.^eyyid Ibrahim bin Kais from Kustak, the other by Sheikh Salih from Sammed, the intervening tribes falling under the inlluence of one or other of these Chiefs. {b) To declare a British protectorate over Oman. I trust it may not be considered presumption on my part if I express the opinion that the time is drawing near when we may have to take some step in this direction or the march of events will force it on us. The advance of Russia, the interest taken by that Power and by France in the Persian Gulf, where they have no commercial responsibilities, the gradual extension of Turkish iniluence over the Arabian peninsular, and the future political conditions of Persia, are all questions in connection with which our future position in the Gulf will have to be determined. The hold which a protectorate would give us over Oman and its important harbour and coaling station at Muscat, which could easily be rendered impregnable, would materially strengthen that posi tion. Any question of the extension of French influence at Soor or of interfer ence in the politics of Oman would at once be set at rest, and a more effective barrier would be plnced in the way of Turkish designs on the country, when a more general movement of that nation towards Arabia takes place. 14. In the country itself I believe that a British protectorate would be welcomed by the people, both Hinawis and Ghafiris alike, with the exception perhaps of the maritime tribes of Soor, who still continue to traffic in slaves; the people are well disposed towards us, they know our power, and would be glad of the rest which a final appeal to an authority whose decision they would not question would give the country. On all sides since the rebellion from the Sultan downwards in Muscat have I heard the same expression of opinion—it behoves the British Govern ment to look into affairs—which can only be interpreted as a desire to see closer relations established between us and Oman, whilst there is a van-ue feeling abroad that, unless the British Government takes some definite action, the Sultan will not be able to hold his own, and security w r ill not be perma nently established in Mutrah and Muscat, where our interests chiefly lay. 15. A protectorate need not necessarily imply an unqualified support of the reigning Sultan against the declared voice of the people, which I may say it w 7 ould be very difficult to ascertain in view of the rivalry existin 0, between the Gbafiri and Hinawi factions; but given that with our support the Sultan ruled moderately well—and his rule has never inclined to undue severity lie would look on that support as the certain means of his retaining the Sultanate, whilst it would effectually check the designs of ambitious Chiefs like Sheikh Salih bin Ali. We need not interfere in internal affairs more than we may )consider it necessary to do, though I believe that such is the power of our name in Oman that the exercise of a little tact on the part of a British officer would go far to settle many of the inter-tribal disputes which ordinarily occur. 16. Should the Government of India not favour at present the idea of a protectorate over Oman, I would submit, for consideration, whether the protection of our interests will not require us to take some active steps when Mutrah and Muscat are again threatened. I have already explained the reasons which in my opinion would require us to adopt this course. With the enemy outside the towns a word from us followed if necessary by a few shells from one of our men-of-war in the har bour, would probably have the effect of dispersing the rebels as it has done before, and saving the property of our subjects from plunder. 17. But the best safeguard would be a clear intimation to the leading Sheikhs of Oman that, whatever differences they may have with their SultaiT, we will not permit an attack on Mutrah and Muscat. I am aware that this would imply the active support of the present ruler in the event of a rebel lion against him, but without some such support it is difficult to see how the property of our subjects and their trade are to be protected, whilst such a clear exposition of our intentions would be the surest preventive against a rising, as the Chiefs would know that it would bring them into contact with our power. 18. In return for this support we might demand from the Sultan a closer reliance on us, an earnestness on his part to be willing to be guided by our advice, the right to inspect bis fortifications and advise him in the matter of his defences for which we might supply him with a moderate amount of newer arms and ammunition, and lastly a*voice in his political relations with the leading Chiefs of the interior. 19. If, on the other hand, it is considered that Seyyid Feysul is not a ruler to whom the Government of India would be willing to accord*this measure of support, then we must be prepared to see the property and trade of our subjects placed in jeopardy on every occasion of a rising against his authority, and how often this may now happen it is impossible to say. The Sultan can always retire to the forts on an emergency, and unless the enemy are strong enough to invest them and force their capitulation, an arrangement will be come to as in the last rebellion with the result that the principal loss will fall on our people, and that trade will be for the time paralysed. 20. I may add that in both Mutrah and Muscat, our subjects own the principal wealth in merchandise, goods and house property, whilst the export and import trade of the country is mainly in their hands. The value of this trade is shown in the last returns as 38 lakhs of dollars, and that is a low estimate. In point of commercial interests, Mutrah and Muscat may now almost be said to be British towns. 6 foreign Office Presa JTo. 181—17-5-95—56.No. io 65-E. From The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, To The POLITICAL RESIDENT in the PERSIAN GULF. Simla, the 2gth May i8g$* Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter marginally noted, ^No. c, dated the 2isi March 1895. enclosing copy of a full report by the Political Agent, Maskat, on events con nected with the late rising in Oman. 2. Details as to compensation to British subjects, for loss occasioned to their property during the disturbances, cannot probably be-settled until the work of the Committee now sitting to investigate the various claims is finished. Meanwhile the Government of India approve of your view that reparation should be exacted from the offending tribes in the form of a tax to be levied on their export trade, and that a demand for this should be made on the Sultan. 3.

His Highness may be authorised to notify in distinct terms to the tribes concerned that his demands upon them are made at the instance of the British Government for acts committed by the tribes against the property of British subjects during the rebellion. 4. At the same time His Highness should be given clearly to understand that his responsibility as Ruler of Maskat in the matter of making good the losses of British subjects is in no way lessened by the fact that the Government of India consent to the levy of compensation in the manner indicated. 5. Should you consider early action desirable with a view to the recovery of a portion of the indemnity during the present year, the Political Agent may intimate to the Sultan the decision at which the Government of India have arrived in time to admit of the issue of the notification to the tribes and of the imposition of the tax before the coming date season opens. The rate of the tax may be settled by His Highness in consultation with the Political Agent, on the principle that it should be sufficient to produce in two, or at the most in three J-2 ^ years the probable amount of the compensation to be Jsuecf by Hil the notification should be seen and approved by you before it .s by Highness'. 6.
