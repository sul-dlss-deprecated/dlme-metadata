Yusuf Kanoo came to see me today (April 29th) and said that he would refuse the agency if we wished him to do so, though it would mean profit to himself and though not to take it would merely mean someone else getting.it. 3. He asked me to enquire whether there was any objection to his taking up the agency. 4. It is impossible to stop Japanese goods coming in at their low prices, and I would sooner that Yusuf Kanoo held the agency (assuming the firm to be a reputable one) than other possible aspirants. 5.

(O.T. ) No.3, of May 7th, with enclosures, addressed by the Political Resident, Bushire, to the Department of Overseas Trade, copies of which have been sent direct to the India Office, on the subject of prospective Japanese agencies to be taken up by Yusuf Kanoo for (a) The Persia and Japan Trading Co.Ltd., and (b) the Steamship Line of w Mitsubishi Enterprises w , I am directed by Lt.Col.J. Colville to state, for the information of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, that, in general terns, this case is one of a respectable local firm asking whether they may take up competitive agencies for foreign goods. In the analogous case of Soviet goods, it was decided that no objection could be offered since, if one firm fails to take up the agency, another will do so. 2• Colonel Colville therefore proposes, subject to the concurrence of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, to inform the Political Resident that, for the reason given, he should raise no objection to these Japanese agencies being undertaken by Yusuf Kanoo. 3* ith reference to the last paragraph of Colonel Fowle 1 s despatch D.O.T. {B.S. )No. 8 of May 7th, Colonel Colville feels that it does not fall within the functions of the Department of Overseas Trade to procure a/ The Under Secretary of State, India Office. Hi/ a. status report on a Japanese firm; - the grounds, if any, for such an enquiry are political rather than ccmmercial. The local firm, having decided to represent a Japanese trading entity, must do so at their own risk. He therefore does not propose to take steps to obtain such a report. 4.

I had the impression that this question had been discussed before, but my office is unable to show me any papers. In any case, even if there were any previous discussion^ it must have been in a very different international atmosphere, 3# There is little doubt that even the vaguest hint would be sufficient for His Highness and his Government to tale actionf and though obviously the price of cheap gimerack articles would go up we do not think that the public would object to a special tariff on goods dumped here by the detested Japanese. The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, KCIE., CBI3. f Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B tf 3 H I R E. Yours sincerely, /!SBOUST. D» Q« m ♦ 0/ 501 « Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Qulf&gt; Gamp, Shiraz* Dated the 5th August, 1939* v &gt;ls Gould you please refer to your demi-official letter iio • C/428-9/8, dated the l7th July 1939, suggesting that the Bahrain Government should put a penal customs tariff on goods of Japanese origin. B. There are various reasons against this step, of which the most important is perhaps that His Ma3esty f s Government who, except for the Chinese, are the party suffering most from Japanese aggression, have not asked Bahrain Government to take any such action as you propose, nor have His Majesty’s Government themselves imposed any discriminatory tariff so far against Japanese goods. When and if His Majesty’s Government do this it will be time to consider whether the Bahrain Govern ment should follow their example. In the meantime there is no need, I think, for the Bahrain Government to be 'plus royalirte que le roi*» and I am pretty sure that His Majesty’s Government*s attitude would be the same as shown by their ^Aj, w&gt; ^ telegram itfo.3635, dated the 12th November 1935, in the case of sanctions against Italy, which in that case they themselves had actually applied* 3. Another disadvantage would be that the price of Japanese goods would, of course, rise considerably. Ihe people in Bahrain who would suffer would be the general public, who are poor and therefore purchase these goods in preference to better class articles at higher prices. Whatever may be the feelings of the Shaikh and his family against the Japanese, I do not / imagine H.Wei ghtman Esquire, ICS.» Political Agent, Bahrain, C/o Postmaster, Ziarat.2 &lt; imagine that the average Bahraini has any particular animus against them or, at any rate, any animus which is at all likely to outweigh the blow to his pocket* 'ihe unpopularity of such measures would react not only against the Bahrain Government, but against ourselves who would be regarded, and rightly, as the instigators of the measure*30 P.A As ordered I informed Khan Sahib Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanu on Saturday the 26th May 1934 at 5 p.m. that, in connection with his letter which he wrote to P.A. asking if there was any object ion to his taking the agency of the Persia and Japan Trading Company, there is no objection. Khan Sahib Yusuf Kanu has asked me to convey his grateful thanks to you. 27.5.34/ cu will remember that before I left Bahrain we discussed the possibility of Imposing a special customs tariff on goods of Japanese origin. I enclose herewith for your private information a cc Py fu y letter of the 17th July on this subject and of Sir -iy --Zl ' ; i-renchard* s reply which I have just received. 2. Personally I do not feel we ought to leave the matter where it is. To the objection raised in paragraph 2 of Sir Irenehard* a letter there is the obvious reply that since Bahrain exports nothing to Japan (not even oil these days) there is not the same commercial objection to a penal customs rate on Japanese goods in Bahrain as there would be in England, since the Japanese themselves cannot take retaliatory action* 3. As far as I remember the Iraqis have insisted on Japan taking Iraq exports up to © certain percentage of the value of Japanese imports into Iraq. It is an amusing - but scarcely profitable - speculation to wonder what would happen if Bahrain insisted on Japan taking Bahrain pearls up to 60 per cent of the value of Japanese imports into Bahrain t However there is no point in pursuing that idea. What we might consider, I think, C. DaIrymple Belgrave, Esquire, .Adviser to the Bahrain Government, in /- Bahrain.! in oraer to meet the objection raised in Sir Trenchard*s third paragraph, is the imposition of a penal customs rate on Japanese articles describable as luxury articles, and on Japanese cement* Perhaps you would think over this in the course of the next month or so and we could have a discussion about it when I get back* 4* Will you please treat this as strictly private and personal ?
