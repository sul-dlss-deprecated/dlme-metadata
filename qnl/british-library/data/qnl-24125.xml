I informed Your Excellency that these papers were given to persons who passed through ,atar and remarks to this effect namely that they passed through Qatar^were noted on them in order to keep the Bahrain Government aware of the fact and then the matt erf lies with them^to decide. as Your Excellency know, ,atar have dealings with the i eisian ports on the §outh, who take most of their necessities from iu. ihe majority of the inhabitants of these places iaks: call at Qatar on their way to Bahrain and bring with them some of the things that are needed for the country(.atar). When they want to leave A they ask us for certificates^ and we are compelled to give them papers to show that they were passing through Qatar, in the same manner as-if they were travelling direct from Persia to Bahrain It is then for the Government to allow them or refuse them permissio] ! If we refused th grant them such papers ikay which show who they were and for what purpose they were travelling, they will cease to come and our country will be empty from many things needed and n 'n t . greatly thus will lose the import of things^needed for the place which come from the south Persian ports . Your Excellency will observe that owing to reason explained above^and in on.er to avoid loss we were compelled to give such papers. As regards the question of the clerk of the Customs signing tor the Director, I have taken the matter into consideration and issued strict orders about it. frl t 3 k.R.ITo PA/PP/.

I have also before me three passports issued by H.M. The King of Nejd to his own subjects for their journey to Bahrein. The travellers in fact went from Jubail to D’bai, where they took an endorsement from the Ruler of D'bai and proceeded on to Bahrein.

Sir 9 I have the honoui? to inform you that a good many travellers now-a-days arrive from Bahrain without being in possession of Certificates of Identity issued by you. They however hold a form of permit issued by the Baharain Government. For your information, 1 enclose four samples of the kind of document they present to this office for endorsement. It will be seen from these documents that beyond the name, no descriptipn of the holder is given, and I have therefore been granting the holders Certificates of Identity instead. It naturally follows that in the absence of any sort of description of the holder on his paper, it becomes rather difficult for my office to know whether the holder is the original owner of the document or not. I write theffore to ask you if I am to recognize these i permits just as if they were Certificates of Identity and as good as those issued by you. In any case I do not think, these permits can take the place of 'passports” in any ?fay.

Do you approve of our issuing our local Gulf x^assports to foreign subjects? U I understand that at present you do not issue such passes so if we made Bahrain subjects take them out, while foreign subjects were not compelled to it would seem rather unfair. Another thing is the limits of the Gulf, I know geographically Muscat is outside but I dont see why the paper passes should not be valid for there. 7/e have held up the matter till the passports all arrive and now we have the whold lot of them so can start issuing them. I believe your identity papers cost Rs 1/- for a single journey so ours at that rate work out at the same price. Have you by any chance any form of passport rules which we could have a look at.

Bear Colonel Biacoe, Many thanks for your despatch ho.1725 of the 24th ultimo enclosing a copy of the Government of Bahrein Proclamation lo. 5 of 1549 A.H, I have been examining this document which, I find, calls for certain comments# (a) In the first place, the proclamation deals entirely wxtn the passport system for Bahreinis as at Bahrein, and refrains from going into what Bahreinis in other countries are to do when desirous of tahinf out a travel document. This is a point of some interest to me as up till now this Consulate has, whenever the occasion has arisen, issued Bahreinis with British passports in which they are individually described as a “British-protected **n**»*nr?. native of Bahrein. H ■person 1 regularity of this procedure seems ■unquestionable inasmuch as Bahreinis are amongst those who may invoke the operation of Chapter I.XII of the General Consular Instructions (see the Annoxzsc&amp;i in their own behalf# The best course to be adopted in this connection a s from now onward and the one which I shall adhere to for Hie time being would appear to be the following, vis;- I (i) 1 /i iK P&gt;. { (ii) e .'Voa'ble the Political Eesideat fi C«in saX»G m era I« 7 TV bisshihe. The Political Agent, Bahrein, to supply this Oon.sula.te witfi suitable application forms,si that Bahreinis applying at this Consulate for travel documents may fill in a fora and send it to Bahrein, as laid do»n in sub-paracraph two of the first paragraph or Foreign Office despatch Bo.20 (T 2652/60/378) or larch 31 , 1930 * to this Consulate, copy of which was sent you in my despatch 1005 of April 30,1930; This Consulate to continue, in cases i/\ '\2 . cases of urgency, to supply Bahraini applicants with a restricted British pass'oort, or - 'End preferably whenever possible - with a simple Ikergeacy Certificate, I to assist them in travelling to Bahrein* (b) I take it all renewals of Bahreini passports will have to be effected at Bahrein, Bahreinis living at Basra, for em-sple,sending in their passports to Bahrein with the requisite fee* (c) Section 8 is unhappily drafted, in my opinion, and X scarcely know where to begin in discussing it* To deal with the least first* for M visa u the word 'endorsement* should have been used* It is, further* not stated what authority is to give this 'visa”* There is m oWxous difficulty owing to the non- existence of Bahraini Consuls* It is finally, to my mind clear that British subjects under the provisions of Chapter Ilf1 {Passports) of toe Central Consular Instructions which, at sections 4 cmd 8, links m&gt; directly with Chanter MIX {rotoetion-Claims), are entitled by the British nmpir© endorsem.ent (see Regal tion.

The Political Agent, Bahrain, at Karachi. The Secretary to the Hon f ble the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, ^ : Sir, I have the honour to submit for the information of the Hobble the Political Kesident a summary of our practice in Bahrain in dealing with passports. 2 .British subjects require a visa or certificate of identity endorsed for Bahrain to enable them to enter, and on leaving for Iraq, Kuwait or Muscat are given visas for these countries, the Iraq visa being subject to the restriction f^jmade by that country. Sh/ould they leave for Persia, their passports are endorsed for Persia,if this is not already done, and they are instructed to obtain a visa from the nearest Persian Conall. Fo endorsements or visas are given for q atar .and one minor Arab ports,nor are any endorsements given for the | Hasa as no visa is at present required but the 'permit to leave Bahrain' is utilized instead. Should this visa at any time be insisted upon,great difficulty would be caused as it would be necessary to send passports away for the visa,the Hedjas Government being allowed no representative at Bahrain. Banrein subjects will be dealt with as outlined in Proclamation Fo.5. The State would however, be preoared to modify this to some extent is requited to do so, to assist Arabs from the Arab ports(Kuv/ait to Muscat inclusive)to enter Bahrain. The poits that arise in the Proclamation are that the Political Agent no longer endorses 'paper passports'(certificate of identity)for the countries mentioned and only endorses hook passports for Foreign countries. It was apparently themm . * ■ • 2 , * intention His Majesty’s Government that the Bahrain Govern ment should not issue paper passports for Persia,but it will be n noticed that they contemplate doing so. Since these paper passports will inevitably be seized and destroyed by the Persian authorities, I suggest that this may be allowed to stand as the cost is much less than that of a paper passport, p yf In Article 8 of the proclamation the wording should refer to all passports and not only British and British Indian passports. If the proclamation is revised I suggest that this should be so amended, Persian passports present considerable difficulties. They are n6 longer allowed to enter Bahrain without a proper visa, but certain exceptions are made,e,g,divers are allowed to enter on an entry made in the-ir divers books and certain • • merchants either already resident in Bahrain and in special . i cases others are allowed to enter on a no objection pass giv^n them by the Bahrain Government. The Captain and crews of sailing vessels are also allowed to come ashore on business during the time their vessel is in port. In this Agency telegram Ho.792 dated the 18th July 1928, the question was asked whether the Bahrain Government or the Agency should issue certificates of identity for Arab ports. The reply, Residency letter No.296-S i' dated 22nd &lt;July 1929 did not refer to this .point and a ruling is requested upon it. Since the Bahrain Government have been authorised to issue papers to their own subjects only and to Persians for return to Persia only,presumably the Agency should issue them. Such persons, in fact all persons of whatever nationality, travel to Hasa ports and Qatar on the ’permit to leave Bahrain’ which is issued by the Bahrain Government, and if necessary return on it with an endorsement from bin Saud’s Amirs or the Shaikh of Qatar. Presumably a Persian long resident in Bahrain who desires to travel to a foreign country should either obtain a regular Persian fassp.rt or ,1s, tie. out Strain ^* It \ 3. .. 4t will entail hardship, and it would be preferable that such persons should be issued with a certificate of identity if they do not wish to return to Persia. !j! Other foreigners, including Iraqis, Nejdis,Hedjaziz, Syrians, Palestinians, and Egyptians are allowed to land on showing a proper visa for Bahrain, and their passpo^rts are endorsed by this Agency on leaving Bahrain. In special cases 'l such persons Nejdis are excepted, and also granted certificates of identitv by the Agency to enable them to return to their native land. Arabs from Muscat, Kuwait and Trueial Coast are admit- ; ted on a certificate of identity visaed or issued by the Political Agent, or Residency Agent but subject of Muscat now adays have book passports, also visaed by the Political Agent. It will be noticed that a Bahrain book passport or paper pass port for these countries will not In future bear the Political Agent’s visa. I was informed by the Residency letter to 481-S dated 28th September 1929 that the Muscat Government dad not issue book passports. Actually they have been issuing them for over a year, and the Bahrain ones are copied from them. In conclusion I would like to say that the introduction of a passport system on the Arab side is going to cause a great deal of confusion and will involve a very poor public in a great deal of unnecessary expense. The Muscat passport costs Rs.lO,and the Bahrain one Rs.7/- and there are other small fees to be paid in addition. Many people who would otherv/ise travel are prevent ed from doing so by consideration of the cost. Or if they travel reduce their followers to the lowest possible figure, which must affect the steamer companies adversely. A Bahraini wishing to proceed to Bambay must now take out a book passport and then obtain an Agency visa at a cost of ’8/- and if he takes four servants, he will have to pay Rs.35/- more than he would former ly have done. Such a sum would be a consideration for an English family visiting, l et us say, Antwerp, and represents avery large amount to a public that thinks in rupees. Infact the only persoj who appears likely to benefit is H.3.M.Consul at Basrah who I understand is reaping a golden harvest, and who is charging the highest rate permissible for visas for Bahrain, amounts which in the case of Americans are very high indeed.

Sir, I have the honour to draw the attention of the Hon’hle the Political Resident to a visa which has been given on an American Passport,No:16 for Miss Rexroth,by the Passport Officer to the Government of Bombay. The Humber of the visa is 15998 and the fee was received on the 5th January 1931 but the Government stamp is dated 2nd January 1931. 2. This visa is surprisingly worded as follows: 'Good for one or more direct journeys through Egy t within one year (provided that the i assport is so long valid) undertaken for the sole purpose of reaching Persia.' The lady obviously could not reach Persia by a direct journey through Egypt and as a matter of fact she has no intention whatever of going to Persia. She sent me her Passport on arrival at Bahrein as it had a similar visa ' o:15999 for ’Irac^ of the same date, a visa for a 'direct journey for the sole purpose of reaching Persia',since she feared that difficulties would be raised when it was found she was not going to Persia. I have given her a transit visa for T Iraq^ and have advised her to obtain a normal visa for Egypt in Baghdad. 3. Further I noticed on her Passport a gratis visa given by the Persian Consul at Bombay for 'Bahrein,Iran'. This I am cancelling,as the statement cannot be allowed to- -Ta,i~fr -I,,, w ■TrmshtSHi 2 . to pass,and also as the Persian Consul has no business whatever to give visas of any kind for Bahrein, I understand,on enquiry,that these visas were obtained for the lady by the American Express and that the^Persian visa was obtained because she might wish to go ashore at some Persian Gulf ports. Actually she lias no Persian visa and consequently cannot land in Persia but only this irregular visa I have mentioned above for n Bahrein,fersia fT ,for which no fee was charged.

Such persons will be required to apply to their own Government for a national passport. Bahrainis wishing to return to Bahrain will, however, be granted Emergency Gertificates valid for single journeys to Bahrain. 2. The Government of India also ggree that Bahrainis passports should be renewed by passport issuing authorities in India, but have decided that, as in Bahrain itself or elsewhere, renewals should be granted for 2 years at a time up to ten years, at a fee of Rs.5/- for each renewal. This is in accordance with the Bahrain Passport Begulations and it would be anomalous for the Government of India to charge a smaller fee than is levied elsewhere.

I have the honour to refer to your letter No; 1289. datid the 1 'W'-. 20th June 1931 and to enclose three passes si/yied by one liana * bin lashid bin Maktun,apparently of Dubai. It appears that these passes Fere given to divers who cme to Bahrain and although their passes were not in order they were allowed to land as they were in possession of diving books. Viith regard to the second paragraph of your let ter under reference 3 1 presume the Hon T bio the Political Resident only requires that steamer passengers should have their passes issued by the Residency Agent at Sharjah. There is a large traffic in* sailing craft direct from the Trncia] Coast^from such places as Abu Dhabi and Has al Khaimali ? and it would be a great liardship to poor people if they were obliged to proceed to Sharjah to obtain passes before sailing; in fact in many cases it would be impossible for them to do so* In Bahrain a distinction is drawn between passengers by steamer and passengers by country craft and in the case of country craft some latitude is permitted,the nakhudas and crews ? for example,being allowed on shore during the stay of their vessels in harbour without papers. Divers are,of course,permitted to land, here on the strength of thciir diving books,since many of them come from places where there are no passport facilities,as for instance,the fangistan ports,and the Bahrain Government have no desire whatever to impede their entry into Bahrain.WC • /7 / 4 cf 1931.

As a general principle the Political Hesident considers that the placing c± restrictions in the way ci suojects or Arab coast Sheikhdoms travelling to other Arab Sneikhdcms in the Persian G-ulf should be avoided as much as possible.

(a) what travel facilities should be accorded to natives of the Hadraraaut and the Persian Gulf States by His Majesty’s Consular Officers; (b) how such persons should be described In any passports or travel documents which may be issued to them; (c) what fees should be charged to them for the issue of such documents. (3) The modifications to sub-paragraoh 3 of the instructions to His Majesty’s Consul at Basra proposed by the Government of India appear to be satisfactory more particularly since they obviate any risk of charges of discrimination against German and Soviet citizens in regard to the grant of visas for thethe territories concerned* It would apoear to be desirable, however, to lay down definite ins time t ions in regard to the fees to be levied for such visas. Mr,Henderson is there ore of opinion that His Ma 3*aty f e Consular Officers should be in- fox’med that fees should be levied according to the nationality of the a:olicant on the sfase scale as British visa fees excent in the case of nationals of countries with which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom hove concluded visa abolition agreements when the standard fees of ten gold francs and one gold franc for ordinary and transit visas respectively should be levied. At the same time it would ©Iso perhaps be desirable to make it clear to His Majesty’s Consular Officers that the requirement of visas for entry into these territories applies to Iraqis. (4) Mr,Henderson would also suggest that the opportunity should be taken to inform His Majesty’s Consular Officers that British subjects desiring to travel to any of these territories require an endorsement on their passports for which, it is presumed, tne usual endorsement fee of two shillings should be charged. In tills connexion I am to enquire whether such endorsements should be granted to British subjects without application to the local British authorities concerned. 2 . a copy of this letter has been sent to the Colonial Office.

Alternatively he is acting in his normal capacity as one of His Britannic Majesty's -Consular or Passport officers dealing with frelndly aliens and as such will issue natives of the Arab Coast States with visas for travel in the British Empire and to Critlsh Mandatory Territory where such are necessary.

RePerence Foreign and Political Department letter No: D. 4844-G/3Q, dated the 17th February 1931 to the Government of Bombay. 2. In that letter it was laid down that the fees for visas to Bahrain should be the standard fees of one and ten gold fi'ancs respectively for transit and ordinary visas and reciprocal charges are levied for visas granted to Bahrain subjects and also for Nejd subjects proceeding to India. 3* The Political Agent, Bahrain, has represented to I ■ mi t ! - ' me that these charges are in many cases very onerous and Yusuf Yasin, Secretary to His Majesty* King Bin Baud raised the same q.uesticn with me during my recent visit to Hasa. Captain Prior has pointed cut that many of the persons who visit India from Bahrain are petty shop keepers going down to replenish their stocks etc and they are frequently accompanied by one or two members of their family and pcssiDly a servant. Similarly many of the Indians who come •( to Bahrain are of the same sort of position and earn their j living as assistants in shops, clerks etc. The British India Steam Navigation Company deck fares from India to the Gulf are already high and to call on such persons oc pay perhaps Bs. 28A cr Rs. 35/- extra for a family party (at Rs. 7/- per head) is certainly a very substantial tax. Yusuf lasin asked me if I could also get it reduced for4 I consider these representations merit sympathetic consideration, a reduction would benefit Indians as well as B ahrai nis and Nejdis. The poorer members of the Mercantile Community are passing through difficult times at present and I think it behoves us to help them if we can. I would therefore suggest that in future the change for visas for India issued to Bahrainis and Nejdis and vice versa, i.e. visas granted to Indians proceeding to Bahrain should oe reduced to Rs. 1/- in each case. This fee might he the same for both transit and ordinary visas. (3d) H.V. Biscce. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. ATTESTED. (3d) E.H.

In the event of persons without papers claiming to be subjects of the rulers of the Hadramaut, Bahrein, Koweit, or Muscat or of any I of the Trucial Sheikhs, and applying for travel facilities, they should be invited to fill up a suitably drafted application form. These, in the i case of the Hadramaut, should be forwarded to the Resident at Aden, , in the case of the Trucial Sheikhdoms, to the Political Resident in the |j Persian Gulf; and in other cases, to the Political Agents in the States | concerned.

My dear Minister, According to the official report received, the persons who are travelling to Bahrein with the permission of the Police are refused permission of arrival hy the authorities and officials of Bahrein who have instructed that such persons should obtain beforehand permits from Bahrein through their acquaintances and then leave for that place. As you are aware, the procedure and arrangement I | regarding the travelling to Bahrein for the past 25 years consisted of the 'Elm-u-khabar” system. It had also been arranged with H.E. Sir Robert Clive on September 9th 1929 that as long as the termination of the general Convention is delayed, the preservation of the ’’Status quo” will be maintained in respect ■f i of Bahrein and the Bahreinis. As the introduction of the procedure mentioned above in Btorein is entirely against the explicit terms and purport of this arrangement, I shall be very grateful if Your Excellency will be so good as to cause urgent instructions to be issued to * | n the representative of H.B.M’s Government in Bahrein to prevent ■ such measures and to maintain strictly the observance of the situation existing at the time of the arrangement. I avail myself of this opportunity. .•••• • ; I 1 (Signed) Mohamma Ali Feroughi.Minute b? k’r.B argali ay August 193^* This is m ancient question* up to the end of 19£8 persi an subjects who visited Bahrein were allowed to land on the strength of a document called an 5 r ram-o-]Chahar fl , a travel doouraent issued by the Persian authorities to Persian oubjeots desirous of travel ling from one Persian port to another. f rhis does not seem to have been the result of any particular policy or agreement but was part of the easy-going procedure of those days. On the other hand Bahreinis had been able, up to li£ 6 f land in Persia on the strength of travel documents issued by British or Bahreini officials. This was partly due to the feebleness of Persian in Strati on and partly to the fact that iohsjnmerah, where most of the Bahreinis landed* was tinder the effective control of the Arab Sheikh JCh&amp;z&amp;l* furlag 112$ {see the Annual Report for that year) the Persians began to emphasise their claim to Bahrein by cancelling the British certificates of identity given to Bahreinis travelling to Persia end levying fas fines on those who did not possess Persian identity papers. pretty exasperated by the Persian appeals to the League, and in 1928 {see Animal He port for that year, page , 6 ) he decided that no Persian should be allowed to land in Bahrein unless he had a proper passport or certificate of identity signed by a British Consular Officer. The regulation was not put into force until January 1st* 1929. After some preliminary rumblings at Bus hire the This exasperated the Sheikh of Bahrein, already persi an- 2 - Persian Cfovernaent ma4e an offioial protest on January 5 th 1929 and the subseriuent eonrse of the discussions is fully shown in the Annual Report for 1929 (page 24). It ai^r b« noted that the original protest made no mention of the status ^uo, which does not seem to have been thought of as a policy of general application to oulf Affairs until September 9th,1929. This agreement was not oomitted to writing and was arrived at orally between Sir h.Clive and feyraourlache on that date; it was on this occasion that Teyrao-irtaohe made the promise, never fulfilled, that Bahreinis in Persia should not be further molested during the treaty negotiations. The discussion with the Persian Government continued throughout 1930 and early 1931. The following papers are wort a reading, although the minutes may prove a little confusing : 375/2 - 4/1 of 1930 375/2 - 5 of 1930 375/1-4^/1 of 1930 375/1-2 of 1921 375/1-2/1 of 1931 375/1-4 of 1931 (note from the Persian Government lie. 33353/7101214 dated 21 st March 1931 g seat to the Foreign Office under despatch uo* 150' of April ?th f 1931, and to India under P.L. 61, Bush ire ?.l. 46 of the &amp;&amp;m date).

M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum I understand that some questions have been asked recently by the Persian Government about the passport system in Bahrain, so I am submitting this . memorandum giving particulars of the procedure adopted as regards passports by this Government 1. Exit a nd return -permits . A local Persian resident wishing to leave Bahrain and return is % issued with an exit and return pass, which is merely a receipt for Rs 3/- on the back of which it is noted that the holder is permitted to return to Bahrain within one year. If he does not return within one year the Government has the option of allowing to return or not. 2. Exit Permit . Persons residing in Bahrain and not possessing documents and not Bahrain subjects, wishing to go to the mainland ports are given a receipt for Rs 2/- on which is stated ‘ T valid for journey to mainland only' T . When they return they are required to produce their own nationality passport. This forms a useful check on all foreigners leaving Bahrain for mainland ports. ' lisgfaMHfetaaMaMiiSfiiiHSril - 2 - 3* Divers T permits. Foreign divers employed by Bahrain Nakhudas* ihe diver wishing to leave Bahrain at (jhuffel and intending to return next season takes an exit permit on payment of Rs 1/- which he produces again at Itekbah when he is charged Rs 2/- as landing fee. Ihe divers book is the proof that he is a genuine diver of a Bahrain Nakhuda. Persons under this category are almost entirely Persians. 4* Book passes. Issued only to Bahrain subjects for travel outside the Gulf. 5* Travelling -passes . Issued only to Bahrain subjects and valid for Gulf ports from Muscat to Kuwait, Rs 2/- valid for one year, wife Rs l/-. ** Ilm al Khubar is not recognised, but regular Persian passports with visa of a British Consular official are required. t Persians from South Persian coast, if known to be merchants, are allowed to land for purposes of trade for a definite period if their application is approved of by Government. They are required to produce a written guarantee from a local merchant on which a stamp of Rs 5/- must be fixed. In some cases persons under this category take out an exit return pass when they leave. This con cession is granted only to genuine traders. Persians resident in Bahrain on applying for permis sion for a relation to visit them from Persia are given permission if the circumstances warrant this and are charged Rs 5/- guarantee stamp and Rs 2/- landing permit. In such cases the person is given a definite period during which he can remain in Bahrain. Sip' Persian subjects living in Lingah wishing to come to Bahrain and possessing no passports apply by letter for permission and are allowed to land on payment of Rs 2/- Landing fee, afterwards taking out proper passports* # 4 These arrangements have been in force for several years and no complaints have been made on the subject. ! The main object is to check arrivals and departures and to prevent undesirables from entering Bahrain and this has been effectively done until recently when I have had cause to suspect that m some indigent and undesirable persians have landed at places other than Manama and Maharaq. All applications are forwarded to me personally for approval and a large proportion are Injected.O-r I s No / 33 3 v v\V The Secretary tc the Handle t he Political Kesi&amp;ent in the Persian G-ulf, Bushire, presents his compliments tc The political Agent, Muscat, The Political Agent, Ba lira in, The Political Agent, Kuwait, and forwards hy direction -the a copy of the undermentioned documentSf with enclosures.

In order to determine the equivalent in local currency of the value of fees fixed*in gold francs, the French franc will be used in place of the United States dollar as hitherto, 10 gold francs being regarded as equal to 50 French francs and 1 gold franc to 5 French francs. The same ratio will be used for fees of any other amount fixed in gold francs. 3. You should, therefore, in future collect local currency equivalent to these sums, using the current local quotation for exchange on Paris in place of the rate on New York hitherto used. 4. In all other respects the instructions conveyed in the circular referred to above remain unchanged. 5. Unless you are otherwise directed in future, you should continue to collect fees fixed in United States currency in the same manner as hitherto, e.g., for a fee fixed at $10 you should collect the equivalent in Ipoal currency of $10 at the rate of exchange for the dollar current at the time of payment. 6 .

As you know the circular is at present being revised by the Foreign Office and they have asked us now Qatar should be dealt with in the new regulations. Qatai seem: to have been regarded hitherto as one of the Trucial Sheikdoms for this purpose (see your despatch to Basra ro.-idmi ox 16th July, 1932), and as a general principle it seems desirable that this treatment should be maintained. Ic mane the position clear we have suggested that the words'including Qatar' should be added after 'Trucial Sheikhdoms' in the new circular, and i understand that the new regulations r/ill in any cao 8 include a comple'oe list of the Trucial Sheikhdoms. 2 . We assume, however, that Qatar is not within the area for which the Residency Agent at Shargah is responsible and that any questions in connection with it are dealt with \J by the Political Agent, Bahrein, under the orders of the Resiaent. Could you confirm that this is the case? If it is, then minor amendments will be necessary in the new paragraphs which are to replace paragraphs 4 and 5 of the present circular. ^We should be grateful if you could confirm our assumption that any Certificates of Identity which might be issued in respect of natives of Qatar would be signed and sealed by the Political Agent at BahreirAand that Certiiicates of nationality or Travel Documents issued by the Sheikh should be recognised by Consular Officers only if they bear the Political Agent's seal. 3.

Dated, J/Awal, 20, . 1352 No. of °-/S'of 1352 &amp;5&amp;A, /A, Bahrain, H. B v M f s Political Agent, Memorandum:- The Bahrain Government is at present finding considerable difficulty in enforcing its passport regulations and it appears that numbers of indigent and undesirable aliens are entering Bahrain by unauthorised channels. 2. In order to assist the enforcement of the passport regulations I propose asking H, E. Shaikh hamad to sanction additions to the passport regulations on the following lines, but as the persons concerned are mostly foreign subjects I wish first to enquire your views on these proposals which are as follows:- a. To insert the following clause at the end of the regulations. 'Persons contravening any of these regulations ahaii be punisheble with nuuct ,prison^which may not exceed three months or with fine or with both.' b. Persons having entered Bahrain without passports or in contravention of any of the pass- * j, port regulations shall be liable after this date- 2 - &gt;K date to be removed from Bahrain at their own expense. ^Police officer, Customs officer, or passport officer is empowered to arrest without warrant any person who has contravened the Passport regulations or against whom reasonable cause for suspicion exists that he has contravened the above regulations. Any officer making an arrest under this section snail without delay hand over the arrested person to the officer in charge of Police Station who will immediately notify the Magistrate who has jurisdiction over the person arrested. 3. I also suggest the advisability of an order insisting that all foreigners arriving by native craft or by deck on steamers shall before being allowed to land be required to deposit with the passport authorities the sum of Rs 10 /- which will be refunded to them on leaving the country . Divers would be exempted from this rule, the fact of their being divers is known by their being in possession of diving books. This would put a stop to many persons who arrive here literally penniless, looking for work which is not to be found. Adviser to the Government. Copy to Passport Officer,i GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN.

It is, however, observed that their applications are generally far fron being complete, which necessitates further enquiries into the matter thereby Enjmrxxn?; the work of the staff. In the circumstances, I venture to suggest that we may have the application form printed somewhat on the lines indicated in the draft submitted below for your approval to obtain the requisite information from the applicants. I further suggest that should there be no objection, printed application forms should be charged for at a rate of m 1 each (by means of court fee stamps which would be defaced) to cover the cost of paper and printing. Subject to your approval these forms be supplied to the Bahrain Petroleum Company also. To begi^n v/ith, BOO forms are considered sufficient which should be kept with the petition clerk. increasing 8/4/34 Ovju^ c y v ^Spoken. ihe form may oe adopted, but I do not think that a fee shd be charged ,at any rate at present. It would be difficult to charge our own subjects a fee which we do not charge to foreigners - and would hardly be fair to charge foreigners for a certificate in connection with a visa for which we charge a fee. In cidentally to do so might make them question the principle imvolved. 6.5.541 , Particulars of applicant:- [V ^ (aVAddress (b) Nationality (c) N®*and date of his Passport and.by whom issued (d) Prof ession 2 .

Sir, I AM directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to inform you that the Persian Government have refused to grant visas for Persia upon, or otherwise to recognise, British passports which have at any time been endorsed for travelling to Koweit or Bahrain. 2. In order to avoid the restrictions upon the movements of British subjects in the Near East which would otherwise result from the attitude of the Persian Government, you should in future refrain from! endorsing for Koweit or Bahrain the passports of British subjects who contemplate travelling also, whether immediately or at any future date, to Persia. A person desirous of visiting Koweit and/or Bahrain as well as Persia shou ld be advised to travel via Basra and to apply to His Majesty’s Consul there for the necessary facilities. Should this course be impracticable, you are authorised to grant a separate and temporary passport, to be held in addition to the ordinary passport, valid only for the specific journey to Bahrain and/or Koweit, and to be surrendered to a British consular officer as soon as possible after its object has been achieved. This passport should on no account be produced to any | Persian authorities. 3. Persons holding valid passports which already bear endorsements for Bahrain or Koweit who wish to travel to Persia should be advised His Majesty’s Consular Officers authorised to issue or renew passports.

In such cases the usual endorsement fee No. 78 should be charged, the issue of the special passport being regarded as equivalent to endorsement. The usual fee No. 76 should be charged for the issue of new passports in the circumstances described in / paragraph 3 of this circular. 5.

The situation regarding Baharainis and Foreigners is as follows:- The Bahrain Govt, have been permitted to issue pass- sports etc. to their own subjects only and not to Foreigners who are under our protection. The requset made by the local Govt, in April 1929 to allow them to issue passports to ail nationals was not granted being inadvisable and undesiraoie. BAKARAINAS. The Bahrain Govt, will issue passports for travel to destinations outside the Gulf and uo Persian ports which will be xssx vise by the Political Agent. The Bah. Govt, will also issue passports (book or paper passports to Baharainas travelling to ports on the Arab Coast of Gulf as ( viz, Muscat, Kuwait, Duoai etc. ) which will also be vise by the Political Agent-• They will also issue permits to ail persons intending to travel to mainland ports ( such as Qatar, Qatif, Hasa, Jubail etc ) which will not require the Politic Agent f s visas. By ' ARAB COAST OF GULF ” in the G. of I. lette Coast' MAINLAND COSSE is meant. PERSIANS- T * 16 holders of the re &amp; ular PersisJ1 Passports will present them to this Agency for visas as hitherto. As regards the Persins, who are long resident in Bah and who are not in possession of regular passports, intending to trav&amp;l/o destinations in Persia and else- -whe're/fo definite instructions have b E e ^ j ^° eiveu * '' ,e ceased to grant them C. of I. since &amp;*\t***r+ ana the Bahrain Government started to issue tnem travel documents, A reference to the Hon’hle the P.R is necessary on the subject. The Persians born in Bahrain. According to this Agency and Bahrain Govet T s notifications tnose bortv in Bahrain and not registered at the Agency are treated as Bahrain Subjects. The same procedure as in the case of the Bahrainas is applicable to them. OTHER FOREIGNERS. The Europeans, Americans, Egyptian*, Iraqiand, Syrians, Nejdis etc. as a rule are in possess- - ion of regular passports and being under our jurisdic ^ tion we only give visas on their passports. With the exception of the case of the Persians ^ resfdent in Bahrain not holding regular passports the procedure regarding others is clearviz, all pass* A « ports and paper passports issued by the Bah.

Between the last two words ' Every passport ff , the words ' British and Foreign ' may he inserted so as to apply to all travellers and not only to iJU British and British Indians I would mention here the procedure followed in the c case of passports issued hy the Muscat Govt. All passports issued hy them to their nationals are invariably endorsed hy the Political Agent, Muscat. I believe the same procedure appears to have been contemplated hy H.M T s Govtin the case of Bah. Passports with the exception of only the Arab Coast ports J&amp;pffilM NOTE.f Persons horn of Foreign parents in Bahrain and not registered in this Agency are treated as Bahrain Subjects. PERSIANS. The procedure followed hitherto is as follows:- (a) Persians long resident in Bahrain not holding regular Persian Passports and in special cases those residing putside the islands were given travel documents hy the Bahrain Govt, to enable them to travel to other countries and return to Bahrain. (h) Persian travellers to Bahrain who were in possession of regular Persian passports duly visaed hy the British Indian passport author ities [V* ities or one of His Majesty’s Representatives in the G-nlf ports were allowed to land in Bahrain and their passports were en dorsed by this Agency on their leaving Bahrain.

J In the end of July 1929 The Hon’ble the P.R. visit Bahrain and you had discussed with him this question but feucxx the same procedure as outlined in (Afi was followed and no C.Of I. were granted for India, It would be better now to ask the Hon’ble the P.R. as to the procedure to be followed in the case pf Persians not in possession of regular passports and those long resident in Bahrain intending to travel to various countries.

It will be observed that Foreign Nationals other than the subjects of Muscat, Kuwait, Bahrain and Iraq are being charged a Visa fee of Rs.7/- for India whereas the same nationals are only charged a fee^ of Re. l/- ; if they desire to travel to any place other than India. As far as I arn aware neither the Consular Instructions nor the Indian Passport Regulations differentiate the levy ing of fees according to the countries for which visas are given and I cannot find anything on record to show why such a procedure has been adopted here. For your inf oration I atigkt may mention here that in accordance with the Consular Instructions, such of the Foreign Nationals who do not come under the Retaliatory Visa Fees are charged a fee of 1 gold franc for transit and 10 gold francs for an ordinary visa. If this system of Visa Fees is sanctioned here the revenues of this office in Court Fees will undoubtedly show an appreciaole increase. Before charging these fees, however, it will be neces -sary for us to be supplied with the list showing the countries whose nationals are to be charged the retaliatory fees and the amount of the fee iagrpdaix chargeable to such foreign nationals ■ 1— —I (EFT, mcK Section.

More-over they said that they had no head to charge me Rs 7/-/- i.e. visa fee. At last the matter was referred by the Assistt.Secretary, Punjab Govt.,on the telephone, to Mr. Courtney, Superintendent, F. &amp; P. Department, Govt, of India, who informed the former that visa was necessary in my case. I was then asked to produce a Court Fee Stamp worth Ps 7/-/- and visa was granted to me.dak... \ 1 eXegram Ho. 1025,dated 14-11-14)33,from Britconeul.Buslilre. Re. Visas.
