Kermanshah, November 1, 1941. Enclosure. Kermanshah Diary for the month of October 1941. (A) General Observations. THE general situation within this district during the month of October gradually deteriorated in every respect. Insecurity and brigandage increased, the local food situation became worse and prices of many of the most generally needed food-stuffs rose to record levels. In addition, the Persian military forces suffered defeat at the hands of the Kurds and were unable to check the depreda tions of armed tribesmen or lawless villagers, even in the outskirts of Kermanshah itself; bribery and corruption continued here on as large a scale as before—one of the chief culprits being no other than General Moghaddam, the Persian Military Commander, who left here—in disgraces—on the 14th October. 2. It is not surprising, therefore, that local feeling (always inclined, even before our entry into Persia, to be predominantly pro-German), which had shown some sign of veering slightly in our favour soon after British forces entered Persia and the ex-Shah was deposed, gradually became more hostile. Britain was blamed for all the troubles which descended one after the other upon Persia. The promises of drastic reforms in Persia and of better times for the oppressed masses, made by means of British radio broadcasts, seem (to Persians) to be receding instead of being fulfilled, and the hopes which were then raised have been so completely dashed to the ground that anti-British feeling has developed in strength. 3. If the British military forces had, at least, made some effort to assist in restoring order and security in the districts around Kermanshah which have been ravaged by brigands, the Persian public might, with oriental fatalism, have accepted the other misfortunes which the invasion of Persia had let loose upon them. But the indifferent attitude adopted by the British military authorities—while chaos and disorder have reigned in scores of villages situated just off the main roads —has thoroughly bewildered, disappointed and disgusted the majority of the population. It has, moreover, fostered the idea—which pro-German Persians were not slow to propagate from the outset—that the British Government’s protestations of friendship for Persia and its declared policy of assisting Persia are sheer hypocrisy, and that Britain’s aim is to hasten the collapse of Persia and the time for its dismemberment. 4. From the foregoing review of the general situation it will be gathered that conditions here are most unsatisfactory. Indeed, unless General Shahbakhti achieves unexpectedly rapid success in restoring order within the next few weeks, the outlook for the future is serious, and all the elements are present for producing a dangerous situation very soon—next spring at the latest—especially if insecurity continues to be so general that villagers cannot do their autumn pleughtwg and sowing. £otfijjpt within a few miles of their homes.

The most important question to which reference should be made in this diary is the uncertain position in Central Kurdistan. At present Kurdistan ^ divided into three zones :— (a) The northern zone, which lies south of Lake Urumieh (Rezaieh), which lies within Russian-occupied Persia. This area lies outside this consular district and outside the area which British military forces have been patrolling from their Sanandaj headquarters. Little precise information is known regarding conditions theie. (b) The central zone, which is situated to the south of zone (a) comprises the whole area adjoining the Iraq frontier between Zohab and Sardasht and reaching as far north-east as Diwandarreh and as tar south as Ruansar, but not including Sanandaj. In this zone Kurds (includino’ several influential Iraqi Kurds) have ousted the I eisian police, gendarmes, tax-gatherers, customs officials, in spectors of the Department of Agriculture, &amp;c., and have apparently set up a provisional administration of their own. Strangely enough, this Kurdish effort at self-administration seems to have worked fairly well so far; there are indications, however, that jealousies have already broken out among the Kurdish leaders, and that the latter aie likely to start trouble among themselves soon. If this is really the case, it may explain the apparent slowness of the Persian authorities’ attempt to regain control in Central Kurdistan. They may be waiting foi inevitable dissensions to appear among the Kurds, for the Kuids present apparently “ united front ’ to break up and for a convenient occasion to play oft some Kurdish leaders against others. (c) The southern zone of Kurdistan (including Sanandaj); this comprises Persian Kurdistan not included in zones {a) and {b) above. I he Persian Government at present exercises in this zone authority which is more nominal than real; indeed, brigandage is rife in many parts of it and real security can be enjoyed only where British Indian military patrols constantly operate. 6. In the first week of October the Kurdish leaders inflicted at ^aqqiz a defeat on a Persian force which included a few tanks and armoured cars; the Kurds rapidly advanced towards Sanandaj, which they aimed at occupying and makino- their “ capital.” The small British force at Sanandaj might have been overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers, but the officei commanding the detachment succeeded in persuading the Kurds to remain at a distance to the north and west of Sanandaj. Dopes were held out that the Persian authorities would in the near future meet Kurdish leaders and that differences would be settled by negotiations; the prospect of this, more than anything else, probably influenced the Kurds when they agreed to keep away from Sanandaj. There is, however, so much mutual distrust between Kurds and Persians that it seems to me that, unless the negotiators are encouraged and actually helped to ‘ ‘ get together ” in order to discuss their differences, e.g., by giving them safe-conducts, the negotiations may be indefinitely delayed. It is to be hoped that a meeting will take place very soon, and that a just settlement of the dispute will result therefrom. General Shahbakhti is'being requested to endeavour to secure a peaceful settlement of the Kurdish problem, but his blunt manner and forceful methods seem to be more suited to the battlefield than to the conference table, and there is thus some danger that negotiations (if they do take place) may not produce the desired satisfactory results if General Shahbakhti handles this delicate nicittGr 7 * jt is now known that General Moghadldam made no serious effort to comply with the British General Officer Commanding’s orders to take rapid and energetic action against the 6.000 to 8,000 persons illegally in possession of arms. In fact, it is known that, as fast as rifles were recovered, Moghaddam reissued them (on payment of large sums which he pocketed) to villagers who clamoured to him for arms for their self-defence; no steps were taken to ensure that the arms thus handed over would not be used for offensive as well as defensive purposes. Similarly, many officers and men sent out to disarm brigands became brigands themselves or deserted and sold their rifles at the first convenient opportunity.In this way, owing to the complete absence of discipline in the demoralised Persian army and the general contempt in which soldiers held most of their officers, the military situation rapidly deteriorated and brigandage increased up to the time when General Moghaddam left for Tehran. 8. The new general officer commanding (who is styled “Marshal” — &gt; Shahbakhti) has a big and difficult task ahead of him and has openly referred to the poor quality of the material from which he expects to raise a volunteer army. However capable a soldier he himself may be, I have grave doubts of his ability to organise before next spring an efficient Persian force which will be able to disarm the tribesmen and brigands in this district in under a year, owing to the utter inefficiency of most of his officers. Ef, as seems the case, Shahbaknti does not contemplate taking large-scale military measures for collecting rifles this autumn, it presumably means that he proposes to allow the present state of insecurity to continue at least until next spring, for winter operations are not usually relished by the Persian army Although Shahbakhti has so far given the impression that he is anxious to collaborate with the British authorities here, it has been suggested that he is playing for time and keeping one eye warily on the movements of the German army near Rostov. The possibility should not be excluded that he, like Moghaddam, fears that a Russian collapse may result in German armies pouring into Northern Persia, and that he therefore has no particular desire to identify himself openly as a whole-hearted friend of Britain by facilitating matters in Persia for the British army of occupation. (D) Persian Administration. 9. After the departure on the 26th September of Mr. Nikpay, the pro- British Civil Governor of Kermanshah, a Military Governor (Colonel Nasehi) was appointed on the grounds that such an official would have wider powers and, by not having constantly to refer every question to Tehran for decision, would deal with administrative questions more expeditiously. The inefficient colonel, who, at General Moghaddam’s suggestion, became Military Governor here, has been worse than useless, having neither initiative nor administrative experience. In consequence, local administrative matters have drifted into a terrible muddle, especially as the problems requiring urgent solutions have been more numerous and complicated than ever owing to the abnormal conditions prevailing here. 10. Colonel Dombali, the harsh Military Governor of Shahabad, has been removed from his post, and, whatever sort of official his successor may be, the change can hardly turn out for the worse and must do a little to increase respect for us. If only a few more corrupt officials or instruments of the ex-Shah’s policy of oppression could be “ unstuck,” it would do something to restore a little our rapidly waning prestige. (E) Food Situation. 11. Sugar continues to be scarce and very dear. There is a sufficient supply of wheat, but its high price has caused the price of bread to rise very considerably during the past two months, provoking a bread riot on the 27th October. As this incident has already been fully reported upon, it need not be described in this diary. It suffices to mention in that connexion that a large percentage of the public here persists in believing that the increased cost of bread and the wheat shortage are directly attributable to British intervention. 12. Rice supplies are still fairly scanty, but the position with regard to this commodity has improved: during the past month; the fact that rice is no longer sold only by the Department of Public Economy, as a monopoly, has given much satisfaction to the public. Ghee has also risen in price owing to the keen demand for it from Tehran and to a shortage of it resulting from the unwillingness of villagers in outlying districts to risk bringing it to Kermanshah through brigand- infested areas. There is still an acute shortage of cigarettes in this district, and this has encouraged holders of stocks to overcharge. Meat supplies for the town have also been smaller during the past two months and prices have risen slightly in consequence. Owners of live-stock have increasingly been selling their animals to buyers in Iraq, where higher prices are obtainable for meat on the hoof. The price of kerosene has during the past three weeks been raised from 1-22 to 1-44 rials per litre, and this increase, which comes into force just at the be«-inning 24-43 B |of the winter, when more kerosene than ever is needed, has caused much dissatisfaction. 13. The generally unsatisfactory food situation calls for urgent action. The Persian Government is probably unable to remedy the present state of affairs, partly because its administrative machinery is unequal to the task, and partly because it seems to be unable to obtain sufficient supplies of certain necessary food-stuffs from abroad. As this unsatisfactory situation is causing anti-British feeling, it is to be hoped that the Persian Government will be given immediate assistance in obtaining part, at least, of the commodities it requires to import from abroad 1 to relieve shortages here. 14. It has been suggested to me that at least the shortage of wheat might be temporarily relieved if some of the bakeries here were encouraged to mix barley or maize-flour with their wheat-flour, and if the second-class bread thus made available were sold at much lower prices for consumption by the poorer classes. This seems a good idea, and I propose to urge the local authorities to consider the above plan and to put it into practice, if possible. (F) British Interests. 15. A rumour reached this consulate on the 28th October that the Persian staff of the Anglo-Iranian Company’s refinery here proposed staging a demon stration on the following day against the extra hours of work they are now doing without extra pay. The General Officer Commanding 6th Indian Division was informed and took precautions to deal with any serious incident which might occur, but nothing transpired, and it is understood that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company—to forestall any trouble which might arise—proposes to make increases in the pay of the company’s workers. Since early in October there is a “ black-out in the Kermanshah refinery area. The British members of the refinery’s staff are now doing A.R.P. work regularly. 16. Two British Indians and an Iraqi employee of this consulate have complained that brigands have looted their property from villages near Kerman shah. the British military authorities have, on being notified by this consulate, urged the Persian military authorities to recover the'stolen property and to find and punish the culprits, but, so far, no satisfaction has been obtained. Indeed, it seems doubtful whether any redress for the losses suffered can be hoped for as long as the Persian gendarmerie and military forces remain in their present demoralised state and are unable to maintain order, even in the immediate vicinity of Kermanshah. The British military authorities have, of course, not actively intervened in the three cases referred to above, and have taken up the attitude that punitive measures against brigands and robbers are entirely the affair of the Persian j authorities. (G) Propaganda. 17. On the 14th October Major-General Thomson, G.O.C. 6th Indian Division here, informed this consulate that British propaganda and publicity activities would not be directed by the British military authorities or by Lieutenant-Colonel Fletcher (the political adviser to the Iraq force headquarters), but that this consulate should continue, as hitherto, to take every possible step to enlighten local public opinion on the war aims and war efforts of Britain and her Allies. Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher has given most valuable advice and assistance in organising local propaganda efforts and in obtaining much-needed equipment (e.g., radio sets, loud-speakers, amplifiers, &amp;c.) As active support from the British military authorities here has been promised—especially by the placing of personnel at our disposal—it should now be possible to undertake much propa ganda work which could not be attempted prior to the entry of British forces in Persia. 18. At the same time, it should be stressed that this consulate will be able to do only one-tenth of what is really necessary until additional staff is provided and until funds, equipment and suitable propaganda literature in abundance are made available. The best propaganda Britain could do in Persia at the present juncture would be to improve local conditions, and more especially the food situation. By saying “What is needed here is more bread and less paper.” General Thomson has pithily and accurately summed up the situation.5 (H) Miscellaneous Notes. Transport of War Materials from Basra to U.S.S.R. via Kermanshah. K 19. Early in October local motor transport contractors were called upon by representatives of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation to produce a considerable number of heavy lorries for transporting war materials for Russia —chiefly jute and lead—from Khaniqin railhead to North Persia. The local freight market was completely upset by the wholesale demands suddenly made upon it and the transport of much local produce and also petrol (in tins) from Kermanshah to other parts of Persia was virtually brought to a standstill. After the initial outburst of great activity, there was a stoppage of the flow of materials to the U.S.S.R. via Khaniqin and Kermanshah for about three weeks, and even now very little is passing northwards by this route. The Shah's Birthday: Official Reception. 20. There was a reception on the 26th October, the Shah's birthday, at which General Thomson and a number of senior British officers were present. The party (which was gloomier than such functions usually are) needs to be referred to only because of one circumstance which, to me, seemed rather significant, viz., that when the new Shah’s health was drunk there was no sign whatever of pleasure on the faces of the people present, and the toast was drunk, very formally, in silence. It would seem that the new Shah has been accepted by people here as Reza Shah Pahlevi’s successor rather more with resignation than with any pleasure. Relaxation of the Boycott on this Consulate. 21. There has been a noticeable tendency among Persians during the past few weeks to renew with this consulate the contacts which, for several years past, had been broken, as a result of the instructions issued by the ex-Shah that foreign consulates should be boycotted. Amir-i-Kull Zanganeh, the most influential land- owner here and one of the Deputies for Kermanshah in the Majliss, a few Government officials and many tribal leaders have thus paid visits to this consulate; it ought to be easy to develop friendly relations with tribal leaders who, for the most part, have pleasant recollections of their dealings with British officers here twenty years ago.

Tbe general situation had much improved, though little progress had been made in the collection of arms. 2. Persian ,-.rmv . The failure of efforts to raise a volunteer force had led to the resumption of conscription. The arrival of General Shah^akhti had induced an improvement in the morale of the local troops, but no operations against the Kurds had yet been w-*v&lt;(fcvtaken. 3. Situation in Kurdistan . General ShahM^akhti had made a good start in his negotiations with the Kurdish rebels. (The Persians have since carried out some fairly effective military operations against the dissident tribes*) 4. pconomic Situation . There was a fair supply of local produce, and the Consul considered that there should be no grounds for anxiety in regard to the wheat supply, provided distribution was satisfactory and prices sufficiently low. On the other hand, there was a shortage of certain products; in particular the sugar situation/situation was serious, since natural causes and transport shortage had resulted in a smaller (({&gt;€££ crop than usual. 5. Persian Administration . General Shah^akhti had appointed officers, who had been associated with him in the past,as military sub-governors in various districts, in preference to landlords and tribal leaders with a stake in the locality. Unfortunately there were grounds for believing that these officers were corrupt and oppressive. The Consul’s remarks as to t^e effect of misgovernment upon British prestige are interesting in view of the scheme which is now being worked out for Consuls to take a larger share in administrative matters. 6. Propaganda. The majority of the populationfatre clearly pro-German, largely owing to the rise in t v e cost of living which had followed the British occupation. Lack of funds and food supplies alike were hampering efforts to counter these tendencies. (The Consul’s suggestions for a midday broadcast and a touring circus have since been turned down) . 7. Aid to Russia . Hardly any war material had so far passed through Kermanshah en route to Russia, and many scores of lorries were lying idle at Khanip^in.

Enclosure. Kermanshah Diary for the Month of November 1941. 1. Public Security. DURING the past month there has been a marked improvement in the state of public security and an appreciable decline in brigandage. Calm has prevailed in most areas in this consular district, but it has been an uneasy peace owing to the fact that little progress has been made in the collection of arms. The Kakawand and Periwand tribes occupying large districts to the south-east and north-east of Kermanshah have been the worst offenders in so far as brigandage is concerned, but the Sinjabi and Guran tribes have also created trouble in aieas close to the Iraq frontier to the north of Qasr-i-Shirin. Some brigandage also occurred near Nahavand (south-west of Hamadan) during the early part of November. On the whole, how T ever, the general situation has much improved and a feeling of optimism has begun to manifest itself among a fair percentage of the population. This optimism has arisen from the fact that, with the tendency for security to become greater and more general, autumn sowings have been on a greater scale than was thought possible a few weeks ago, and local produce has been circulating throughout the district more freely during the past month than during the previous two months. 2. Persian A rmy. General Shahbakhti, the General Officer Commanding, has made only little progress towards the raising of a volunteer army here; exact figures are. not available, but it is considered fairly certain that the response to his appeal for volunteers has been poor. Indeed, the calling up of conscripts has been resumed, and this unpopular measure has created intense discontent among the local population, which threatened, during the month, to organise demonstrations against conscription in protest. The Persian authorities, however, got wind of the proposed demonstrations and forestalled any outbreak of disorder by staging a march through the town to intimidate the malcontents. The morale of the Persian army has, I consider, improved recently as a result of the arrival here of General Shahbakhti. The latter is a forceful and genial personality and his presence here has instilled into his officers and men some measure of self-respect and self-confidence which the debacle of the 28th-31st August last destroyed. I will not venture to express an opinion as to the value of the Persian army as a fighting force, but I consider that as long as the ill-trained and ill-fed troops are (? led) by Persian officers of the present poor quality—and good officers are extremely rare—the Persian army is not likely to be a very formidable danger to an opposing force. This may be the reason why General Shahbakhti has not embarked upon any operations against the well-armed Kurds (especially on [25—14] PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT % L- IE 8480/42/34] Co Py No * 04 Consul Vaughan-Russell to Mr. Eden.—{Received December 23.)

Reinforcements from Khuzistan, which General Shahbakhti was expecting to receive here during this month, have not arrived; operations against the Kurds are, therefore, not likely to be embarked upon for some time to come, even if there should be a breakdown in the Kurdistan negotiations which General Shahbakhtj^v has started. 3. Situation in Kurdistan. General Shahbakhti spent about a week in Kurdistan during the middle of November and began his efforts for settling the Kurdistan problem by negotia tions with the Kurdish rebels. He achieved some measure of success by winning over the important Galbaghi tribe and coming to terms with its leaders, who were confirmed in their position of authority in their tribal area (Marivan district). By treating these tribesmen with consideration and generosity he seems to have ensured that calm will be maintained in the Marivan district, but the Persian Government has not actually re-established full authority in that district. In the meantime, Northern Kurdistan remains outside the control of the Persian authorities and continues to be held and administered by the Kurdish rebels, the most influential of whom is Mohamed Rashid Vineh. General Shahbakhti has not yet come into personal contact with the above named, hut it is reported that he has made preliminary moves to get in touch with them through intermediaries. It is too early as yet to attempt to forecast the course of events in Kurdistan. 4. Economic Situation. The local bazaars have been rather more active this month than during the previous three months as a result of the improved state of public security. While there is a fair supply of local produce (e.g., ghee, meat, tea, wool, and even wheat), there is a shortage of certain products, especially sugar, cotton goods, charcoal and, to some extent, rice. The local population has shown some uneasiness over the food situation here and there was a C£ wheat riot ” at Hamadan on the 19th November. Actually, any fears which the population of this district may feel with regard to a food shortage in the near future seem to me to be almost groundless. This is a rich grain-growing district and, even when harvests are well below average, the grain produced is more than is required for local needs. Even allowing for the fact that some wheat has been destroyed in the course of the brigandage and raiding of the past three months, the total grain produced this year is almost equal to the average of the total production for previous years. The peasants of the countryside have hidden reserves and are least likely to suffer from any shortage of grain. Stocks in the towns of Kermanshah and Hamadan also are reported to be sufficient almost to last until next year’s wheat crop is harvested. Exact details regarding the wheat situation in Sanandaj, Malayyir and Qasr-i-Shirin are not at present available, but there is no reason to believe that stocks of grain there are small and that a shortage is likely to occur before next year’s grain is available. A different state of affairs may be produced if an attempt is made to meet Tehran’s requirements during the next six months by drawing too freely upon the stocks in this district. The food situation here is unsatisfactory owing to the recent increase in the prices of nearly all commodities. Bread is sold in Kermanshah at 3 rials per batman (6| lb.) in defiance of instructions received from Tehran that its price should be 4 or 4| rials a batman. Despite this, bread is too dear for the poorest classes to buy enough of it to keep body and soul alive, and a large proportion of the population is therefore living in a perpetual state of under-nourishment and misery. The sugar situation remains serious, for local stocks will shortly run out. The Shahabad Sugar Factory started production in the middle of November— three weeks later than usual—but this year’s output (i.e., 1,200 tons) is expected to be much smaller than the average for the past four years, i.e., 9,000 kharvars = 2,700 tons. The falling off is the result of a smaller beet crop this year caused by frosts last spring and insect pests, which damaged a large percentage of the crop; production is also likely to be reduced because a small percentage of thebeet crop has been lying in the open exposed to frost for a month past and insufficient motor lorries have been available to collect the beets. Many lorries were ready to collect the beets, but were immobilised because no tyres for them were to be found. Sugar means so much to the population here that, should supplies of this vital commodity run out, much discontent is bound to result, d he ^^Jame for the shortage is certain to be attributed to Britain; while this is quite ^.logical, it is almost impossible to convince the ignorant masses that, had Germany invaded Persia, their plight would have been fiftyfold worse. The rise in the cost of living has been meteoric during the past three months, and there are no signs here that the Central Government has made an effort to check this rise. On the contrary, it would seem that all-round increases have been encouraged, for the price of even alcohol (arak) has been raised irom 11 to 15 rials per bottle, and the price of opium, too, has been increased by the Government during the past month. 5. Persian A dministration. On the 5th November a Colonel Givian (who had served under General Shahbakhti at Ahwaz) took over the military governorship here, only to relinquish the post the next day to the natural surprise of everybody. Since his departure the post has remained vacant, but it is announced that an “ Ustandar ’ is about to be appointed for the Vth Ustan, which includes the provinces of Hamadan, Kermanshah, Kurdistan and Shahabad. The new Governor is Brigadier (Sartip) Afkhami, who is expected to arrive at Kermanshah (which will be his headquarters) on the 6th or 7th December. General Shahbakhti has, not unnaturally, gathered around him several military officers who have collaborated with him in the past and has piaced them in key positions. Thus, he has as his Chief of Staff a Colonel Alp, who held a similar position under him before coming to Kermanshah. In the same way military officers among the general’s friends have been appointed to military sub-governorships in various districts. It is known that Shahbakhti disapproves of the appointment of influential landlords and tribal leaders as sub-governors of the areas in which they have influence and this explains why Persian officers are, as in Keza Shah’s time, continuing to exercise authority and control over rural and tribal areas. If the above officers were efficient and honest, no very serious objections could be raised to their being chosen to administer the affairs of outlying districts and of the tribal areas, but it is extremely doubtful whether the newly-appointed officers are likely to be any better than their corrupt and inefficient predecessors. Indeed, it has been hinted to me that General Shahbakhti himself has much the same ideas of honesty as General Muqaddam, whom he succeeded, and that the men whom he has recently appointed as sub-governors have paid him handsome sums for the privilege of serving under him; these sums can only be recovered as a result of fleecing the population in the areas under these officers’ control. If these rumours are true—and I fear that there is some element of truth in them— the same scandalous state of oppression and injustice is likely to reign here in the near future as in pre-occupation days. I consider that, if the Persian Govern ment wishes to obtain the best results in rural districts, it should appoint as district sub-governors, persons who have an interest or a stake in the district in question. A large landowner or tribal leader is surely not likely to impoverish or ruin the area in which he has villages and live-stock to anything like the same extent that a stranger might, having no interest in the district except to extract from it the maximum amount of money possible with the minimum of delay in order to recoup the bribes paid by him when appointed to the sub-governorship. Until radical changes are made in the method of appointing officials, injustice and oppression are certain to continue. ' If the population in large areas under British military occupation are, as seems likely, to be exploited and unjustly treated now, as in the past, it is to be feared that British prestige will be adversely affected, for our failure to prevent abuses from taking place will be interpreted by everybody here as either {a) that His Majesty’s Government is powerless to prevent obvious injustices and abuses; or (5) that His Majesty’s Government is condoning a scandalous state of affairs and is supporting local authorities who ought to be removed rather than main tained in power.4 x 6. Propaganda. The maiority of the population continues to show clearly its pro-German leanings; this is evident from the fact that pro-German and anti-British rumours are constantly heard here, having obviously been put into circulation by JNazi- minded Persians. The wheat riot at Hamadan on the 19th November was another outward and visible sign of the anti-British sentiments which are telt by so mar!f v Persians in this district. The recent big rise in the cost of living m l ersia and the' 1 economic difficulties which have arisen since the entry of Anglo-Russian forces into Persia have done more than anything else to stimulate tae bitter anti-Britis i I feeling which is becoming so general here. The possibility that German agents may be sending propaganda instructions to their Persian sympathisers xrom Turkey, through the uncontrolled areas south of Lake Urumiah, should not be excluded. It is certain, however, that pro-German propaganda is being inspired by unfriendly Persians, who are secretly receiving instructions for the conduct of a whispering campaign from pro-German circles in r l ehran. Our efforts to counter this anti-British feeling have, so far, been quite inadequate. Some energetic form of British propaganda is urgently necessary here if public opinion cannot be influenced by immediate, resounding British military successes, or by British efforts to improve the food position in I ersia or by British intervention in the administrative affairs of Persia resulting in an improvement of the country’s corrupt and inefficient administration. Radio broadcasts (in Persian) from London and Delhi are at present quite inadequate, and the time devoted to news and music for Persian listeners should be increased three- or four-fold. A midday broadcast is urgently needed, for the advent of very cold weather is reducing the number of listeners to the evening open-air news broadcasts. On the other hand, crowds are likely to collect in the streets to hear the news between noon and 2 p.m., when the cold is not so severe. It is hoped to obtain, verv soon, supplies of cinematograph equipment and films for use in this district. ' It should be possible to influence public opinion to some extent if suitable films in ample quantities can be made available; the need for carrying on cinematographic propaganda here is urgent and greater than ever. To impress upon the local population that Britain’s position is rapidly improving, and that ultimate victory is certain, we must be prepared to spend upon propaganda and entertaining far more than we have done hitherto. Our efforts here to impress or influence the Persian population are being hampered by iack of funds, or, if money is available, little of it has been spent here. Strange as it may be thought, I am convinced that the appearance in Persia of a good touring circus would do far more to arouse enthusiasm among the whole population and engender friendly feeling towards Britain than hundreds of tons of propaganda pamphlets or months of talks upon the radio. There is one way in which more friendly feeling can be engendered here, and that is to assist the Persian Government in providing work for its unemployed during the winter months. As the main roads in this district are in urgent need of repair and work for many thousands of men could be provided if road repairs were carried out, it is to be hoped that the need for helping the unemployed— who constitute an element of the population which anti-British agitators can very easily influence—will be urged upon Persian Ministers, to the mutual advantage of both Governments. 7. Aid to Russia, via Persia. With reference to paragraph 19 of diary for October, attention must again be drawn to the fact that many scores of lorries have been lying idle at Khaniqin, incurring heavy demurrage charges while awaiting loads from Basra for con veyance to North Persia en route to Russia. The war material which has passed through Khaniqin and Kermanshah en route to Russia has so far been almost negligible, and there seems to have been a serious hitch somewhere in the supply arrangements.

KERMANSHAH POLITICAL DIARY FOR DECEMBER , 1941 • L r-S&amp;PR ' al ooiwwrmas FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. A useful review of the general situation at the end of the year is given in Section I. II . Kurdistan . The Kurds,on realising that General Shahbakhti intended to play off the Galbaghi against the other tribes, renewed their pressure on Persian garrisons and threatened Diwandere. On the 2Cth December, the rebel districts were bombed. As bombs may have been dropped before the leaflets emanating from the British Consulate and explaining the attitude of H.M.G. reached the ground, the Consul feared an anti-British re-action among the Kurds and their kinsmen. (The Persians and the Kurds have since been fighting for possession of Saqqiz)• III and IV . Persian Army, Gendarmerie and Administration. The morale of the Army was low,and there was a good deal of anti-British feeling ) which General Shahbakhti did nothing to check. The Gendarmerie v/as gaining strength and many posts on the main road had been manned. In the absence of a civil or military Governor, General Shahbakhti had been administering the Province himself.(A new Governor-General has since arrived). V. Economic situation . The price of everything was rising unchecked/ MM i,nunchecked by the Persian Government. This rise.which was due largely to the diminution of stocks*-of imported merchandise,and to the n&amp;tural profiteering instincts of the Persians themselves, was blamed, as usual, on the British. The wheat situation was satisfactory and the prospects for the next crop good. Rice was sufficient if expensive, but a sugar famine was threatened. Wages and salaries had risen to meet the -increased cost of living. ^Situation has now improved slightly owing to a drop in the price of some local produce.) VI. British propaganda . This had been held up owing to lack of staff and material. Films, portable wireless and cinema equipment were badly needed. VIII. Trade with Germany. A possible loop-hole had been discovered for trading with Germany via Iraq and Turkey. DC. Russian Consulate. The - prospect of a Soviet Consulate at Khennanshah viewed with disfavour in Persian circles. n. War Staff. 'Vs / Secretary. E. &amp; 0. Department . (yedTcwS ?

HIS Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of Kermanshah Diary for the month of December 1941. Kermanshah, December 31, 1941. Enclosure. u)o^ crih^, h\ I £ ^jjryvjrwX^CL (jL/OAl OAfl- Kermanshah Diary for the month of December 1941. I .—Review of the General Situation. THE situation here further improved during the month of December. There has been less brigandage and the better state of security which has recently prevailed has enabled merchandise and produce to circulate fairly freely through out the district and has also made it possible for farmers to plough and sow in districts which were considered unsafe last October and November. 2. In Kurdistan the situation has not changed appreciably during the past month; General Shahbakhti’s very perfunctory effort—if it deserves to be called an effort—to negotiate with the Kurds yielded no results. The attack of the Kurds upon a British patrol on the 11th December and the Kurds’ more threaten ing attitude towards the Persian garrison at Diwandere provided General Shahbakhti with an excuse for abandoning any pretence of negotiating and for attacking the Kurds. The latter were bombed on the 20th December, but this activity yielded little in the way of results and the situation is now much the same as it was at the end of November, except that the withdrawal of the Kurdish rebels from Diwandere towards Sakkiz has relieved the pressure upon Sanandaj (Senna). 3. During the month of December the economic situation deteriorated; although wheat supplies are reported to be adequate for the needs of this district until next year’s harvest is available, the sugar shortage has become more noticeable and supplies of many commodities are getting increasingly scarce. 4. During December there has been no appreciable change to record in the state of public feeling here. Discontent, caused by the increasing cost of living among other things, tended to increase feeling against the Allies, but this tendency was to some extent counteracted by the Russians’ successes and by the British victory in Libya. The entry of the United States into the war on the side of the Allies caused a brief sensation, but the favourable effect which this momentous event might have been expected to exercise on local opinion was neutralised by Japan’s spectacular successes in the Pacific. Public opinion here is unable to grasp the magnitude or the implications of the war and remains as pro-German as ever on the whole. British propaganda has not yet got into its stride, but a start has been made. Radio broadcasting and portable cinemato graph equipment with abundant supplies of films and of illustrated (Persian) journals are long overdue and are still awaited. [26—51] bm 2 ' ^ II .—Recent Developments in Kurdistan. 5. December opened with the Kurdish rebels awaiting some sign from the Persian authorities that negotiations would take place and that their legitima te^ grievances would be listened to. Negotiations, properly speaking, were nevt^. attempted by General Shahbakhti and the latter’s short visit to Sanandaj in November did nothing to give the Kurds grounds for thinking that their com plaints would be examined. It was not surprising that, after they saw how the general attempted to play off the Galbaghi tribe against the rest of the Kurdish tribes and made no effort to negotiate, Kurdish rebel leaders decided to renew their pressure upon the Persian garrisons and to seek redress for their wrongs by fighting their oppressors. Early in December the rebels, under Mohammed Rashid, threatened the village of Diwandere, 40 miles north of Sanandaj (Senna). Even Senna itself might have been attacked had not the Officer Com manding British troops there made it clear to Mohammed Rashid that any advance upon Senna would be regarded as a threat to the local British garrison. While the Kurdish leaders hesitated in their uncertainty as to whether the Persian forces would receive the support—moral, if not material—which we were understood to be giving them, an unfortunate incident took place. This incident was the ambushing of a small British military patrol by a party of Kurds on the 11th December on the Diwandere-Senna road; as the attack took place after dusk it is not unlikely that the Kurds (for it seems fairly certain that they, and not Persians, were responsible for the attack) may have mistaken the lorries, &amp;c., conveying our troops in the direction of Diwandere for a Persian military convoy. At any rate General Shahbakhti seems to have taken a serious view of this attack and determined that the Kurdish rebels should be crushed without further delay. On the 14th December he caused a proclamation to be published in the local newspaper, denouncing the Kurdish rebels and threatening to destroy them if they did not surrender. On the 16th December, 12,000 leaflets describing briefly the attitude of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the present situation in Kurdistan were handled to General Shahbakhti for distribu tion, especially in Kurdistan. On the 17th December the leaflets were dropped over various parts of Kurdistan. There are unconfirmed reports that, on the same day, bombs were also dropped. Owing to stormy weather, no bombers could take the air on the 18th and 19th December; on the 20th December, however, it is definitely known that bombs were dropped over rebel-occupied districts in Kurdistan. 6. No reports have been received, so far, describing the reactions of the Kurds to these bombing attacks, but it is to be feared that, if bombs were dropped upon the Kurds almost before the leaflets emanating from this consulate had time to flutter to the ground, the bombing will be regarded by the Kurds as having been British-inspired. Although*they have so far been extremely pro-British and have to some extent been encouraged to believe that they will receive fair play in their dispute with the Persians through British intervention, it is not unlikely that Kurds—not only in Persia, but also their kinsmen and sympathisers across Persia’s frontiers—will now feel that they have been betrayed by us and that a violent anti-British reaction may be produced. 7. There is no sign that the publication of the leaflets describing the attitudb of His Majesty’s Government has created better and more friendly feeling for us in Persian circles here; indeed the reaction of General Shahbakhti was distinctly unsatisfactory and, instead of being grateful for this expression of British support for the Persian Government, he expressed disappointment that our leaflets did not go into greater detail and did not condemn the Kurds in more uncompromising language. 8. The end of the year finds the Persian army very satisfied at the relief of Diwandere and the Kurds dejected after having been driven out of Diwandbre to the northwards towards Sakkiz. In conclusion, the situation can only be described as unsatisfactory, as the state of prolonged disorder in Kurdistan has not been brought much nearer to an end; indeed, the Persians have so far made no progress in restoring their authority in the north and west of Kurdistan, and the rebels are still exercising some form of authority in those parts. It is doubtful whether the Persian military forces will make any serious attempts to drive the rebels out of Kurdistan3 before next April, as wintry conditions make operations extremely difficult and these conditions would probably favour the defending forces, i.e., the Kurds. III.— Persian Army and Gendarmerie. 9. General Shahbakhti received reinforcements during December from Tehran and these have been sent to strengthen Persian garrisons in Kurdistan. Morale of officers and men remains fairly low. Many cases have, however, been reported of Persian officers and men having made anti-British utterances; these boastings of “ what the Persian soldiers will do to our troops when they get a chance ” have been by no means isolated cases. Anti-British feeling continues to be strong among all ranks of the Persian army; there is, however, little likelihood that the Persians would dare to provoke a fight with our troops, for whom they have a wholesome respect. After the treaty with Persia confers upon the latter the status of an ally, it will be interesting to see how Persian officers and men will hide their feelings and to what extent social intercourse between British and Persian officers will follow. General Shahbakhti appears, on the surface, to be friendly, but. if these sentiments were sincere, it is certain that anti-British feeling among his officers and men would be far less general, for he has enough authority and prestige to influence the outlooks and opinions of all the troops under his command. It is obvious that he has made no attempt to create a more friendly feeling towards Britain, for, had he done so, the fact would soon be known. 10. The Gendarmerie is gradually gaining strength and many posts along the main road (which were abandoned two or three months ago) are now manned with large and comparatively keen bodies of Amniehs. It may be that, now that the weather is unpropitious for the activities of brigands and that the dangers of encounters with armed robbers are now more remote, service in the Gendarmerie has again become popular. IV .—Persian A dministration. 11. General Shahbakhti has continued to manage without a Civil or Military Governor in Kermanshah for several weeks and has dealt with administrative problems himself. It is now confirmed that the recently nominated Military Governor, Brigadier (Sartip) Afkhami, will not take over this post. Another candidata, i.e., Amir-i-Kull Zanganeh, a former governor and one of Kermanshah’s members in the Majlis, has been proposed for the post. In the absence of an Ustandar, Shahbakhti has been administering this province and, so rumour states, amassing quite a fortune while doing so. 12. The Persian Government departments are ail hopelessly overstaffed and all officials and employees in them are invariably underpaid. To wield an axe and to remove unsuitable, unwanted employees is virtually impossible, it seems, for the Director of Finance here (an apparently able and honest official) has tried to do so and has bewailed the fact that, of the 800 men on his department’s salary list, nearly half are utterly useless and ought to be pensioned off. He states that he recently put forward to the Ministry of Finance an ingenious suggestion for getting rid of the surplus staff, but that his proposals were rejected; as his ideas were worthy of a better fate they are briefly described hereunder :— He suggestad that each employee whose services were not required should be offered a large plot of ground as compensation for having to leave Government service; the ground should be provided from the thousands of square miles of Crown lands which are lying idle and unexploited throughout Persia. In this way all parties—the State, the Administration and the community as a whole—would stand to gain. V.— Economic Situation. 13. General Observations. —The upward trend of all prices has continued during the past month and there are no signs here that the Persian Government is making a serious attempt to arrest this movement. Stocks of imported merchandise are rapidly dwindling here and in consequence prices are rising sharply from day to day. To quote two examples: (a) A German-made incandescent lamp, which could be bought here for 280 rials in July last, cost [26-51] B 2 ’360 rials in November and cannot now be obtained for less than 500 rials; {b) a lamp chimney-glass which cost 12 rials in July rose to 14 rials in October and now costs 18 rials. Even the inferior Tehran-made lamp-glasses, which cost 4-5 rials each in July last, have risen to the monstrous price of 9 rials. While price increases can he easily explained, if not justified, in the case of imported goods, the considerable rises in prices of locally-produced commodities and good®p are inexcusable. The trouble is entirely due to the cupidity of most Persians, who are by nature profiteers and hoarders almost to a man. They will close their eyes to Persia’s great need for wheat and will quite cheerfully smuggle wheat or other produce out of Persia in order to make large profits by selling on a market where prices are much higher. Never satisfied with a reasonable margin of profit, (say 8 to 10 per cent.) merchants expect a return of 25 per cent, or much more on their investments and commercial transactions; prices are bound to soar under such conditions unless energetic action is taken by the Government. Actually, nothing is being done here and this admittedly difficult problem is not receiving the urgent attention it deserves. If the question of price control is neglected it may cause serious discontent and this is certain to manifest itself in increased anti-British feeling; our troops will, not unnaturally, be regarded as having, by their entry into Persia, created the economic chaos which set in throughout Persia as from the time of their arrival. It seems important, therefore, that in our own interests, the above-mentioned situation should be brought to the notice of the Persian Government and that the latter should be urged to take immediate and drastic steps to check profiteering and to control prices as far as possible. (a) Wheat. 14. The wheat situation is reported to be satisfactory at present and the snows and rains which have fallen during Decemher should improve crop prospects for 1942. The beneficial December rains should result in stocks of wheat—hitherto hidden and hoarded in rural districts and held in reserve lest next year’s crop should be poor-—being brought into the towns for sale to the Wheat Monopoly Company. It is not quite certain whether wheat growers have held back the grain which they will require for spring sowing or whether they have already sold all wheat harvested by them last summer; there is, however, reason to believe that sufficient wheat has been held back by growers for autumn and spring sowings. No grain shortage should, therefore, occur in this district before the 1942 harvest becomes available, as local supplies are, according to statistics furnished by reliable Persian sources, expected to be sufficient for this district’s requirements—provided that Tehran and other towns in Persia do not draw upon this district’s reserves and provided also that unexpectedlv lar^e quantities of grain are not smuggled out of Persia into Iraq during the next few months. (b) Sugar. 15. Local sugar supplies will be exhausted in 6 or 8 weeks; the production of the Shahabad Sugar Refinery funder 1,000 tons and not 1,200 tons as previously estimated) will, when made available for supplying the needs of this district, provide only 4 or 5 months’ supply. By the month of June, therefore, there should remain no stocks locally, unless sugar is transferred to this district in the meantime from elsewhere in Persia or unless imported sugar can be obtained. Supplies from Ahwaz are expected to be sent here within the next month or so. (c) Rice. 16. J he situation has eased m lecent weeks and sufficient supplies are now available for the public, but prices are now 60 to 80 per cent, above those of 3 or 4 months ago; best quality rice was 8.40 rials per batman in August, whereas it is now sold at 15 to 16 rials per batman. It may be added that owing to the enormous increase in the prices of rice and raughan (ghee) the consumption of rice (Persians’ most popular food) has been reduced considerably. ' 1 (d) Cotton and Woollen Goods. 17. There is a shortage of most materials in the bazaars here and prices have risen considerably in consequence. Supplies from weaving centres in Persia such as Isfahan, labriz, Shahi and Yezd, have been arriving in much reducedquantities, as a result chiefly of the increased demand in the places where the textiles were manufactured and also because of the difficulty in securing lorries for transporting merchandise to this part of Persia. Stocks of imported woollen goods are rapidly nearing exhaustion and prices ^jjiave risen by several hundred per cent., as further supplies may not reach Persia until after the end of war. Imported cotton goods (e.g., white shirtings, mulls, “ Italians ” (for linings), prints, &amp;c., which are much in demand here) are quite unobtainable. Although a few bales of Russian cotton goods have appeared in shops here, the quantity has been quite negligible and it has not affected local market prices. (e) Other Commodities. 18. In general supplies are short, but not so short as to justify fears that within a few months the public will not have enough to eat or will not be able to get materials for its clothes. The price of fuel (wood) has, of course, risen steadily in recent weeks and is now at a record winter level, but, as it is normal for wood and charcoal to cost more in winter than at any other time of the year, complaints concerning this price increase are difficult to justify in view of the great demand for fuel and the smallness of supplies, especially as these have to be brought to the towns from remote country districts. (f) Wages and Salaries. 19. There has been a general rise in wages and salaries in the past few months; not only have Persian Government employees had their wages increased by 40 to 100 per cent, (as compared with the salaries paid one year ago), but private employers of labour have also increased the wages of their workmen or employees recently, in view of the enormous rise in the cost of living, which has been continuing uninterruptedly during the past six or seven years. VI .—British Propaganda Efforts in this District. 20. British propaganda activity in this district has been unavoidably restricted for many weeks past owing to lack of staff and also as the result of the failure of the responsible authorities to supply to this consulate sufficient propaganda material (in Persian) and to supply, above all, portable radio broadcasting equipment, portable cinema apparatus and films for the same. 21. Despite these handicaps a modest start has been made in the up-hill task of trying to influence public opinion here. In order to make it possible for the public to hear the news broadcasts from London every evening, under cover instead of in the streets, a disused cinema has been rented and equipped with stoves. In this old cinema between 200 and 300 people forgather every night to hear the news—which is preceded by a short programme of Persian music produced by gramophone records. The cinema provides, at the same time, convenient opportunities for distributing propaganda and publicity material and for exhibiting posters, war photographs, &amp;c. It is hoped to make similar arrange ments in Hamadan, Senna, Kerind, Kangavar and Malayyir, as there is no doubt that the Persian public appreciates these news broadcasts and the short programmes of music which precede them and, above all, the opportunities they afford of escaping from the cold streets to a place where one can linger in a warm atmosohere for an hour or so. 22. A small number of British Newsreel films (with Persian sound-tracks) arrived in Kermanshah on the 16th December and have been shown at the local cinema since that date. They will be shown at Hamadan during January 1942. A few more films are due to arrive soon, but the supply needs to be multiplied several times over in order to produce any appreciable effect upon Persians, the majority of whom seem to be still convinced that Germany will win the war. Spectacular films and radio broadcasts relaying loud music need to be provided in ever-growing volume if any impression is to be made on local public opinion. To this end portable battery-operated radio sets and travelling cinematograph units with all their necessary equipment should be provided for use in Persia in adequate numbers as soon as possible. As long as British propaganda activity is delayed, anti-British feeling will inevitablv increase; this is bound to be the case 16 so long as the difficult economic situation is not remedied and the Persian public remains in ignorance of what the Allies have done to aid Persia in her present difficulties, which are popularly believed to be due to our presence here. VII.— Material Aid to Russia via Persia. 0^ 23. Only a small percentage of the total flow of war materials, &amp;c., which have been entering Russia via Persia during December have passed through Kermanshah, and it is satisfactory to note that the scores of lorries which were lying idle at Khanikin rail-head a month or so ago, awaiting the arrival of loads, have for the most part loaded up and left Khanikin for North Persia. VIII.— German Efforts to trade with Persia. 24. There is good reason to suspect that pro-German Persians and Iraqis are continuing to trade with Germany via Turkey—or at least trying to do so. The method whereby the British blockade is avoided is simple : {a) The Persian exporter declares to the Persian and Iraqi Customs authorities that the goods he is exporting from Persia are destined for either Egypt, Palestine, United Kingdom or United States, via Iraq in transit; {h) the goods at the time they enter Iraq are marked “ Via Iraq in Transit ” and pay the small transit duty; but when once they are within Iraq the bales or boxes (while remaining unaltered as regards weights and markings) are prepared for export to Turkey and, in the place of the supposed United Kingdom consignee, a consignee in Istanbul or Izmir is substituted; (r) the goods are sent by rail to Turkey, where the consignee takes them over and redirects them to Germany. 25. Unless a close watch is kept upon all exports to Turkey from Iraq and Syria, there is the possibility that some merchandise will trickle into Turkey en route to Germany or Axis-controlled countries in Europe; it is believed, however, that the volume of this traffic is not likely to be large. IX.— Reopening of a Russian Consulate at Kermanshah. 26. There has been no Soviet representative here since the end of 1937, when the Russian Consulate in Kermanshah was closed. It is reported that two officials of the Russian Embassy at Tehran are due here shortly and will make preliminary arrangements for the reopening of the Russian Consulate. Reactions in local Persian circles—official as well as private—at the presence in their midst of Soviet consular officials are certain to be unfavourable. J. R. VAUGHAN-RUSSELL.

Kermanshah, February 1, 1942. (Confidential.) Enclosure. Kermanshah Diary for January 1942. oJL^a awvAt tj IilW| I OMJC 'H (a) General Observations. IN this district there have been few developments during the past month, which has passed very quietly. Very cold and snowy weather brought almost to a standstill Persian military activities; but minor operations were successfully carried out against some rebellious tribes, i.e., Kurds (Galbaghi, Sinjabi, &amp;c.) and the Kakawand (near Harsin). At the same time there was a marked diminution in brigandage. The Persian General Officer Commanding, General Shahbakhti, undoubtedly made further progress in the restoration of order during January; indeed, the situation is now almost normal, except in Kurdistan. 2. The Government’s authority is now firmly established throughout the whole Kermanshah consular district except for some areas in Central kurdistan, and efforts to bring these areas under control are likely to be made when the roads are free of snow and military movements can be carried out with greater facility. 3. The general state of feeling here, though still unfriendly, has tended to improve slightly, largely as a result of Allied successes in Russia and in North Africa. Fear and mistrust of Russia are growing, however, and if the Russians’ activities in North and North-West Persia were less hostile to the Persians, there is every likelihood that Anglo-Persian relations would much improve. (b) Persian Administration. 4. Amir-i-Kull Zanganeh, a well-known landowner and notable in this district, arrived here on the 25th January to take over the duties of Ustandar (Governor-General) of the Vth Ustan. On the same date Zein-ul-Abedine Qiami, a senior official in the Persian Ministry of the Interior, arrived here on appointment as Farmandar (Governor) of the Kermanshah Province. 5. Amir-i-Kull is an elderly easy-going man with little administrative experience or ability and possessing very little “drive.” He is not a strong character, and it is clear that he will show little independence of judgment, and will follow the advice of Qiami, an able, energetic official, so it seems. 6. Amir-i-Kull has made loud protestations of friendship and of his desire to collaborate with the British authorities in Persia, and it seems probable that he will be helpful; at the same time it is unlikely that he will be able to exercise much influence over the Persian General Officer Commanding here, who. though not actually unfriendly, can hardly be said to be whole-heartedly pro-British in his attitude. 7. Another important change in the local administration during January was the appointment of Colonel Artta as the chief of police in lieu of [27—43] RECd. POL. DEPt. - f APR 942 INDIA OFFICE2 Colonel Jehangiri, who was removed from Kermanshah largely as a result of his insufficiently helpful attitude to the British authorities. 8. The Farmandar of Hamadan has also been changed recently, and the incumbent of that post is an official named Sayyid Majidi, regarding whom little is known at present. A (c) Situation in Kurdistan. 9. Both the Kurdish rebels and the Persian military authorities have found it impossible to be very active during January owing to heavy falls of snow and to the bitterly cold weather which prevailed here for several weeks, until the 25th January. The Persian military authorities, probably because they suspected or sensed an easing-off in the Kurdish rebels’ liking for the struggle, decided to advance upon Diwanderre (40 miles north of Senna)—where the garrison was beleaguered—and, after a skirmish with the Kurds at Zagheh, near Diwanderre, about the 12th January, relieved their garrison. About thirty-four tribesmen were killed and 150 prisoners were taken; the Persian military authorities expressed the intention of shooting the prisoners as a warning to other Kurds. Lest there should be a wholesale massacre of the latter, this threat was reported to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, who took steps through the Persian Minister of War to prevent it. 10. It can hardly be doubted that, if large numbers of Kurds had been shot or hanged in cold blood as was originally suggested, the Kurdish rebels’ hatred for the Persian administration would have been intensified and their determina tion to resist would have been strengthened. If the Persian military authorities cherished hopes of crushing Kurdish resistance by intimidating the Kurds as a result of wholesale shootings and hangings, it is almost certain hhat these hopes would have been doomed to disappointment. As the Persian authorities must surely realise the unlikelihood of breaking Kurdish resistance by resorting to “ frightfulness,” one is forced to the conclusion that either the threat to shoot the 150 Kurds was an idle one which it was not seriously intended to carry out, or that irresponsible Persian officers were contemplating action which might have produced serious consequences. 11. At a moment when the Russians are reliably reported to be encouraging the Kurds to hope that, with Soviet support, they will be able to secure redress from the Persian authorities or even some measure of autonomy, it would seem high time that the Persian authorities—in their own interests—made a serious attempt to seek a friendly settlement with the Kurds. To alienate Kurdish sympathies still further is the surest way of driving the Kurds into the arms of the Russians and to encourage the Kurds to turn to the latter for help which has been denied to them by the British military authorities. 12. A hint in the above sense was conveyed to the newly-arrived Ustandar (Governor-General), Amir-i-Kull, to-day, and he appeared much impressed with the soundness of the advice. It was emphasised that the opinion expressed by His Majesty’s Consul was a purely personal one, and did not necessarily represent the views of His Majesty’s 'Government. The Ustandar admitted that the Kurds had some cause for complaint, and that there was good reason to attempt a new approach to the Kurdish problem. As a sure means of placating the Kurds the suggestion was put forward by His Majesty’s Consul that conscription (of which the Kurds strongly disapprove) might be suspended—at least temporarily—in Kurdistan. This suggestion aroused no unfavourable comment, and it is not unlikely that the new Ustandar, who is making a series of tours in his LTstan on assuming office and expects to visit Kurdistan shortly, will make some efforts to act upon the advice given to him. Indeed, he expressed the desire to discuss with His Majesty’s Consul the Kurdish problem and to obtain his views thereon and suggestions for solving it. 13. At the moment the roads in Central Kurdistan are blocked with 4 to 10 feet of snow, and no military or guerrilla operations on a large scale can be attempted with any certainty of success. Sakkiz (75 miles north-west of Senna) is still occupied by rebel Kurds, and rumours from Kurdish or alarmist Persian sources that the Russians have moved so far south as that town are regarded as untrue by competent judges of the situation. It is practically certain, however, that a Soviet detachment has for some time past been stationed in Sauj Bulagh, 120 miles north-west of Senna. The Persian military authorities3 5 are known to be anxious to reoccupy Sakkiz, but, as explained above, there is still too much snow on the roads to make an advance to that area possible, and, in any case, it is likely that Hama (Mohammad) Rashid Waina and other Kurdish rebel leaders would oppose the occupation of Sakkiz if and when attempted. 14. General Shahbakhti, General Officer Commanding here, has appointed ^aifullah Khan Ardelan as Farmandar of Sakkiz, but this appointment is obviously premature. He has also appointed as Farmandar of Merivan Mahmud Khan Kanisanan. who will be responsible to him for the maintenance of order in that area. It is difficult to judge how far this appointment should be regarded as indicating that the Persian Government’s authority has been restored in the Merivan and Avroman districts. Actually, there is no confirma tion that Persian military and civil authorities have re-established themselves in that area; if that is the case, the appointment of Mahmud Khan as Farmandar of Merivan is little more than a piece of window-dressing designed to foster the belief that conditions in Kurdistan are improving and becoming normal once again. (d) Tribal Notes. 15. As the tribal situation in Kurdistan has been dealt with in the previous section of this diary, there is little of much importance to report regarding tribal affairs in the rest of this consular district. 16. The Kalhur tribe is quiet, and it is to be hoped that the calm will not be disturbed as a result of the rivalries of the two principal claimants to its headship, Amir Makhsus Ghobadian and Kerim Davudian. 17. Pressure brought to bear recently upon the Kakawand tribe has also yielded good results, and the tribesmen have surrendered and agreed to hand over their arms and most of the property—chiefly cattle and sheep—looted by them from their neighbours. 18. It would, however, be a mistake to conclude from the above undoubted successes that all the tribesmen in this district have now handed over to the Persian military authorities the arms which they managed to collect in September and October 1941. Exact figures showing the totals of all arms, Ac., collected are not available, but it would be unwise to assume that, as a result of recent tribal surrenders, the tribesmen in this area are completely disarmed, determined to keep the peace and willing to respect and obey the Persian Government’s authorities. It is probable that, while a large percentage of the tribesmen’s arms has been surrendered, manv hundreds of rifles—perhaps even 2,000 or 3,000—are still in their hands; it would be too much to expect the tribesmen to give up all their rifles, which will certainly provide the wherewithal for a good and profitable “ shooting ” season later on. (e) Economic Situation. 19. During January prices of all commodities and goods continued to rise sharply, and. despite representations made to the President of the Municipality and to the chief of police by the British municipal t authorities and by this consulate—urging the need for immediate and drastic action to combat profiteering and hoarding and to control prices—the situation further deteriorated. 20. At his first interview with the newly arrived Ustandar His Majesty’s Consul referred to the serious effect of the recent rise in most prices on the living conditions of the overwhelming majority of the local population, and emphasised the fact that, as earlier representations had yielded no results, the time to take immediate and energetic measures to reduce prices and to punish profiteers was long overdue. Although it is only one week since the Ustandar arrived, a beginning in the uphill task has been made and a slight fall in prices of a few commodities has been brought about. The local population is, however, still too apathetic to collaborate with the local authorities and the latter can hardly be expected to make such headway as long as the townsfolk hesitate to denounce profiteers and do nothing to help Government officials in their efforts to check the rise in the cost of living here. 21. The wheat situation is now regarded as satisfactory and local stocks are known to be large enough to meet the needs of this district until mid-July, when the 1942 crop becomes available. Incidentally, the 1942 wheat crops in the Kermanshah district are likely to be about 30 per cent, below the average in volume.4 x 22. Sugar stocks are getting very low and unless further consignments reach Kermanshah before the 10th March, local supplies will by then be exhausted. 23. The local authorities are encouraging farmers to plant, during tne late winter and the early spring, maize, rice and peas: crops of the above will 3e a valuable addition to the country’s food stocks if wheat supplies run short. ^ 24. Supplies of matches in this district have dwindled to almost vanishing ^ point, and cigarettes, too, are getting scarce; in consequence, speculation m e above articles is going on despite the fact that prices for them are fixed by the Persian Government. i • 11 j 25 Imported cotton piece-goods are now almost unobtainable and even locally produced cotton goods are obtainable only with great difficulty as the local authorities are eking out supplies by reducing the amount of the materials made available for sale to the public. (f) Tripartite Treaty: Local Reactions. 26 The treatv negotiations, as described in the Tehran press, aroused not a little interest and' owing to the anti-British attitude of the majority of the population, comment was generally unfavourable at first. As the meaning o the treaty became generally known and the population gradually became reassured that the treaty did not provide for the callmg-up of Persians to serve m the Alhe armies, comment on the treaty became less unfavourable and it was regarded as necessary evil which Persia could not possibly avoid. . 27. ' There is absolutely no trace of enthusiasm, however, and amy function, held to celebrate the occasion of the signature of the treaty are likely to be a fiasco Indeed, despite the fact that General Shahbakhti was informed a month ago that it was considered fitting that the signature of the treaty should be made the occasion for celebrations, he has made no move. ^or has the Lstandc ^ Neither the British military authorities nor this consulate have taken the initiative. As the signature of the treaty has Revoked no enthusiasm, an d t e arrival of a Soviet consular colleague upon the scene will strike yet another discordant note here, it is proposed to await a less unfavourable occasion tor giving a large party. (o) British Propaganda and State of Local Feeling. 28 During the past month there have been no noteworthy developments as far as British propaganda in this district is concerned British news-reels and films with Persian sound-tracks are still awaited. rravelling cinematograph units which were expected to be in commission by the end of 1941 hare not yet arrived The numbers of battery-operated radio sets (with loud-speakers) avail able in this district are still inadequate. Suitable posters and publicity materia are still arriving in a quite insufficient volume; indeed, Persians might well imagine when considering our propaganda efforts in Persia, that Britain is indifferent as to what Persians think about the Allies’ war efforts and is not ti ymg to influence tocal^opmm^ie^ taken to provide the material, the equipment, the funds and the staff for carrying on propaganda, on a suitable scale here, but in the meantime the campaign here is “ hanging fire and our half-hearted methods are arousing in British circles unfavourable comment and criticism. (h) Opening of Soviet Consulate, Kermanshah. 30. With reference to paragraph 26 of Kermanshah Diary for December 1941 M. Viatcheslav Chvetsov, the Consul of the L.S.b.R. ailived Kere on the 21st January, since which date he has been looking for a house in which to establish his consulate. He has not yet made a formal call on H- Maiestv’s Consul. As neither he nor the two Russian members of the consulate s staff sneak any language but Russian, it is difficult to imagine how the Soviet s consulate propose to maintain contact with Persians in general and the local and British authorities here. As Soviet interests here are non-existent, it may make no difference whether the members of the staff of the Soviet consulate are ab e to talk Persian and/or English, or not. ^ ^ VAUGHAN-RUSSELL, Consul.

Kermanshah Diary for the Month of April, 194E. 1. EURDISTAR. There have been man$ important developments during the past month and, after matters had been allowed to drift and the situation had deteriorated to such a^ extent that disorders might have spread to the vicinity of the British lines of communication in Iran, the Iranian (iovernraent suddenly decided early in April that an effort to arrive at a settlement with the ilurds should be attempted* 2» In the first week of April General Shahbakhti, the Iranian G. 0. 0. here and the Ustandar (Amir-i-Kull Zanganeh) informed His Majesty’s Consul that the Iranian Government proposed to give the Kurds a chance of putting forward their grievances and to examine the latter; the following plan was propounded:- the Ustandar would visit the Avroman area and see Kerim Beg; the Kurds* grievances would be discussed and representatives of the Kurdish malcontents would be asked to come to Kermanshah (under a safe conduct) to discuss the grievances which they wished to have remedied; an Anglo-Irauian Commission should be set up, to examine the Kurds* complaints. His Majesty’s Consul could not, obviously, agree to the solution of the Kurdistan trouble by the establishment of the Commission, as suggested, but he agreed to report to His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, the proposals put forward by the Ustandar and General Shahbakhti; before a reply from His Majesty’s negation could be communicated to the Iranian Authorities here, the latter started to put into operation their plan to begin negotiations with the Kurds of S.9. Kurdistan and the Ustandar left for Avroman on the 11th April. 3. Being of Kurdish stock, and being well known to and much respected by the Kurds, the Ustandar was well received oy Kerim Beg of Avroman; he was handed a letter, signed by /seYe^al of the most prominent Kurdish leaders, describing the most irifoort . Ant Kurdish demands; he communicated the contents of this letted to Tehran on April loth, for the consideration of the Persia;: Cabinet. When, therefore, on April loth, the Ustandar called on His Majesty’s Consul to report upon his mission to the Kurds i . the Avroman district, a settlement of the troubles in G. . aru^ istan appeared to be almost within reach - always provided the Kurds and the Iranian Government could agree to make mutual concessions. 4. Almost simultaneously, however, the xurds of . Kurd istan - who may not have been fully aware of the preliminary suits of the Ustandar’s journey to Avroman and of the initial move towards the conclusion of a negotiated settlement - came to grips, on the loth April, with Iranian troops (unaer Colonel Arfaa’s command)stationed near Diwan-darre, north of Senna. Kair^ ly severe fighting took place, and it is reported that the losses on both sides were heavy. It has not been possible to establish beyond doubt whether the Kurds started the fighting or whether the Iranian* troops did so, knowing that they would not be attache by Kurdish tribesmen on their left flank ,from the Avroman and oavanrud areas) as a result of the ’truce’ concluaea between the Ustandar and Kerim Beg on the l‘gth April. The xlurds appear to have been driven in a north-westerly direction and the Iraniau. troops re-took Sakkiz on the 19th April. Strong rumours are in circulation here that Baneh has fallen into the hands or the Iran ian Military forces; that Mohammad Rashid has suffered a heavy defeat and that he is in flight and hiding with 2/3,000 followers in the mountains along the Iraq/Iran frontier. In view of these developments, it is possible the Avromm Kurds, despite their oromise j- 2 - promise to await the decision ol’ the Iranian dovernraeixt regarding the reforms for i.urdistan demanded oy them, may go to the assist ance of their hard-pressed kinsmen in n. Kurdistan* 5* The proposal has heen made that a British Military observer should be sent to aakkiz but no final decision thereon has yet been made* Thus, the situation in Kurdistan, alter show ing hopeful signs of improving during the first half of April, deteriorated a &amp; ain in the latter part of the month ana the pros pects of reaching a negotiated settlement now seem almost as remote as ever. B * IRAKIAJ ADMIN I ST RAT I Olj ♦ 6. Ta') Aghai Arefi, the Mayor of Kermanshah was replaced on the 5th April by Aghai '’aizullah Zanganeh (&amp;ahir-ul-iulk), uncle of Arair-i-uill Zanganeh, the Ustandar. Although professedly at anxious to co-operate with the British Authorities here, Arefi had been unsatisfactory as .iayor here as he had lacked energy and resourcefulness and seemed unable to tackle successfully the difficult problem of forcing down prices here which have risen so much in recent months. The new Mayor is a local notable , ai~d is believed to be willing to collauorate with the capable Pamandar, Aghai -iami, whose energy and drive may now galvanize the Municipality into much-needed activity. ^.b; There is still some doubt as to whether Tarajullah Asif will be appointed iarraandar of Benna; he wishes to hold his seat in the Majliss and at the same time to hold the governor ship of Senna, and the Iranian Government has not yet decided whether such an unusual arrangement can be sanctioned. In the meantime, he is unofficially acting as Farmaudar of senna. (c ; Colonel Artta, the chief of olice in ermansh&amp;h, has returned here, after several weeks’ absence in Tehran; during this period he has been promoted* In view of his evil reputation- and the fact that he was closely associated with General Rukn-ed- Din Mokhtari, the notorious Chief of olice at Tehran in Reza Shah’s regime, stamps him as a police-officer or the worst type- the public here naturally wonders why he has been singled out for preferment and is being employed within the zone of British occupation in Iran* The natural inference is that he is ’persona a rata’ with the British Authorities and that the latter approve of the presence of this unsavoury character in their midst. Almost any Police official would be better than Artta aud his continuance in office is exposing the British Authorities in Iran to much adverse criticism. 7. V*1iile it is fully realized that the supply of honest and efficient officials in Iran is extremely limited, it should be possible, nevertheless, to ensure that the Iranian Government sends, to the ’’British-occupied” zone at least, better officials than many of those corrupt and inefficient men who have been appointed to posts in this district during the past eight months. The anti-British attitude of many Iranian officers and officials here has frequently been referred to and this state of feeling in official circles unfortunately still con tinues, although there are signs thato British propaganda efforts are beginning to influence the minds of an ixicreasing number of local officials. c - BCOnOMIC BITuATIOa* 8. Wheat and barley stocks in this district continue to be sufficient to meet all local needs until the 1‘P4 b crop is harvested. Surplus supplies of grain have been despatched to Tehri Kerman,Yezd and Isfahan during the past month, the total thus for warded being 670 tons of wheat and 1,360 tons of barley between the BlstV 3 the 21st appended March and the 21st hereunder April, 1942.

The Departmeiit of Agriculture here reports that the anti-locust campaign has been carried on with vigour and with complete success; the danger that locusts may destroy crops in this district is now regarded as being very remote. 11.

The re-organisation oi the Iranian Army continues and the strength of the nenaanshah (12th; and Aurdistan ^oth) Divisions has been reduced* Conscripts are still being called to the colours but in spite of the fact that the Army is being re-organ^ ised there is no evidence of any improvement in the training of recruits ^h^tr 21 ^ lessening of the ill-treatment metea out to recruits byAofrieers and E.C.O.s. The aloof and unfriendly attitude of Iranian officers towards us continues but this attitude has shown signs of being less noticeable in recent weeks. Indeed, as a result of pressure brought to bear upon oeueral Chahbakhti, a notice has been posted up in the Iranian Barracks that Iranian officers are now allowed to meet British Officers. R.

'ersian magazines and of QOstei*s and the \ Supplies ofx pamphlets have been received in increased quantities during vast month and the demand for them has continued unaoated. \cj our public radio broadcasts have attracted larger audiences recently — largely owing to the tact thau tne British di^nallers operating the Radio set here have taken a ^ood deal of trouble to provide longer programmes for the public. ^o British films have been received here during omission is, however, lively the arrival in this district (e) the past two months; this regrettable to be maae ^ood in the near future by of a Travelling Cinema Van. a crowd of about 2,000 Iranians was attracted by a Military display ( w RhT,eSAT‘*) given here oa April 30th by the Pipe and Crum band of tbe 1st Ourkha Rifles. On this occasion invita tions were sent to nearly 200 of trie leading officials and inhaoi^— ants of the town and Iranians who were there together with a ^roup of Iranian officers who were present, were much impressed by the precision of the Gurkhas* movements and by the musical programme which was provided. It is intended to arrange for the performance to be repeatedshortly. ( e ; Although it is difficult to measure the results achieved by the oral propaganda which is being carried on in this district there is reason to believe that this iorm ot propaganda is beginning slightly to influence public opinion. His Jiajesty's Consul has continued his efforts to encourage .among many Iranians; some ox the leading, Moslem religious leaders to use their iniluence in making the masses here understand the British point of view with regard to the war and in fostering better feeling towards us among Iranians in general. The British /ice—Consul at Hamadan has also launched an oral propaganda campaign which promises to yield &amp;ood results. Chile it must be admitted that local feeling is still unfriendly for the most part, and that Japanese successes (together with the absence of Allied victories; are continuing to create doubts regarding the Allies* aoility to recover lost ground in the minds of the masses the latter are nevertheless, it is believed, beginning to realize what an Axis victory would mean for Iran and it would seem that opinion is slowly veering in our favour. The good behaviour of our troops and the regular ity with which the British Military Authorities pay for all gooods has of course also created an excellent impression population. bought by them upon the local G.

With the rout of Hama Rashid and his supporters,Kui*dish resistance seemed to have collapsed.

The' situation in Kurdistan has changed coxisiaerabiy during the past month. Since the Iranian forces (under the Command of Brigadier Arfaa) routed Hama Rashid and his Kurdish supporters in the Sakkiz area during the second half of April, Kurdish resistance appears to have collapsed. Hama Rashid is reported to be hiding in the mountainous frontier zone near Baneh and to be canvassing a number of Kurdish tribal leaders ,Iraqi and Iranian) with a view to obtaining support for the continuance of his struggle against the Iranian Authorities, ahether the Kurdish tribesmen will support Hama Rashid and his fellow die- hards will, to some extent, depend upon the manner in which the Iranian Authorities behave in uraistan and especially upon the way they treat the Merivan and Avroman Kurds. It will be recalled that the latter agreed to submit to the Iranian Author ities and put forward, on ;,pril loth, a number of demaxids for the consideration of the Iranian Government. 3 . Apart from promising reforms - vide the Government’s recent declaration regarding its tribal policy - the Iranian Government has so far not done much to implement its under takings with regard to Kurdistan and this appears to have made the fieri van and Avroman Kurds suspicious with regard to the Iranian government * s future intentions. These ..urds’ suspicions have been further increased owing to the way in which the Iranian Military Authorities dealt with Hama Rashid’s Baneh Kurds and other Kurdish malcontents, it is therefore not surprising that Kurdish tribal leaders are now hurrying hither and thither and planning to hold consultations at Halebja near the Iran/Iraq frontier - doubtless in order to aeciae whether or not Hama Rashid should be supported in his struggle against the Iranian Authorities, or whether a settlement with the latter should be madev on the best possible terms, having regard to the increasing unlikelihood of their being able to continue the struggle with much hope of ultimate success.

(b) Since the departure of Colonel Mehr Pouyan from Shah- w ahad (where he was formerly Governor;, the appointment of a successor has so far proved a difficult and aelicate matter, Y/hile General Shahbakhti has hitherto favoured the presence at Shahabad of a Military Governor of his own choice, the Ustandar and ^armandar have lor some time past attempted to persuade him to agree to that post Ipeiag held by a civil Governor. After much argument General Jiahbakhti has now agreed to this but, while outwardly pretending that he is indifferent as to who the Civil Governor is to be - provided that the new man will be able to exercise close control over the tribesmen in that area, who possess several thousand rifles - it is not unlikely that he is re&amp;lly prepared to support the candidature of Amir Makhsus Kalhdr. 6. (c) It would not be surprising if some private arrangement has been made between the Ustandar, General nhahbakhti and Amir Makhsus for. the appointment of the last-named to the vacant Governorship - the arrangement being that General Ghahbakhti would support this proposal, provided thato he received a heavy bribe or else a large shafre of the money 'squeezed'' by Amir ^khsus out of the population of the Shahabad district. Although Amir-i-Kull, the Ustandar has been trying to obtain British support for the proposal that Amir Makhsus should be appointed, he states that he has telegraphed to Tehran urging that a good official should be sent to ihahabad from Tehran. It is to be hoped that British intervention will ensure that a good man is appointed and that Amir Makhsus is not chosen to fill the vacant post. 7 # (di Owing to a dispute with the local director o- the Finance department, the Governor, Aghai o,iami, threatened to resign on the 7th May ana was only with difficulty prevailed upon to remain here. As the easy-goiag ana inexperienced Governor ^Amir-i-kull Zanganeh) would be quite unable to carry on without t.iami, it is to be hoped that the latter will not soon again seek an excuse to get back to Tehran (where he is anxious to obtain an important post); he is too useful and capable an official to be spared from nerm&amp;nshah atu the present juncture. Qiami left for Tehran on the 31st May and General ohahbakhti also left for Tehran on the Buth May; as a result of their visit to the capital, important administrative changes here may well take place in this district. D. AGRIOUGfURK. Q t&gt; Crop prospects, which were so hopeful in mid—April, are now very poor. Apart from li^ht local showers ot rain, this district has had no heavy rains since mid-April. In con sequence the crops in some areas have been almost completely dried up and the yield in other lar &amp; e areas is likely to be very disappointing.

But this form of propaganda activity is quite inadequate; something spectacular urgently needs to be done here.

On the other hand, our public radio news-broad - casts have attracted bigger crowds than ever, the average attend ance nightly having been 142 in April a id 168, in May. Our oral propaganda campaign appears to be slowly gaintoj ground/; local feeling would undoubtedly swing noticeably in our favour if only an outstanding Allied success could be scored but events in the Far hast have not encouraged anti-British elements in the popul ation to abandon their pro- Axis sympathies. As future events on the Russian and Libyan fronts are likely to influence the feel ings of all Iranians, it is to be hoped that Allied counter strokes there will, in their turn, encourage the development of the already noticeable recent improvement in local sentiment.

KSRMM3HAH DIARY FOR THS MONTH OP JUNE 1942. KURDISTuiiT. The situation &amp;n the northern part of this district has not changed during the month. The beaten rebel Hama Rashid remains in the mountains near Baneh with a following now of only forty men or so, while negotiations drag out between himself and the Government in Tehran. In theory he would probably like virtual autonomy for himself and his chief iriends in western Kurdistan, but the Government are not at present likely to grant •weeping concessions, their forces being in a strong position as compared with a few months ago. They are reported to be willing to nominate Kurdish bakhshdars and to allow a large proportion of Kurds in the gendarmerie, but the framework of local government is meant to remain Persian. Hama Rashid may be cogitating over whether he should return to his lands in Iraq as a nonentity, or accept such grudging and unreliable favours as the Iranian authorities may concede him inside Iran. 2. Further south there was local fighting between two sub-tribes oi the Guran, the Babajanis and Kalkhanis, over various grudges including the deflowering of three Babajani girls - a crime which used not to be a Kurdish weakness. After the killing of over a score tribesmen, peace was made with the handing over of three Kalkhani maidens in marriage. A branch oz the Kalkhanis is reported also to have been raiding villages and crops not far north of Kerind. 3. In the Kalhor area, much excitement was caused by the murder on June 14th at Hassanabad of the Kurdish bakhshdar of Gilan, Ali Agha A’azami, by a minor chieftain named Akbari Hojabr. The crime seems to have been one of personal vengeance, the murderer having recently passed years of embittered enforced exile in Tehran while the victim accumulated wealth by co-oper ating with the hated government officials in the Kalhor area, and was also suspected of spying on certain recent chieftains* in trigues on behalf of authority. Hojabre escaped to the mountains and probably hoped to start a local rebellion, but the prompt ac tion of the Ustandar of Kermanshah in visiting the Shahabad area and calming the excited tribesmen averted any real trouble. He was accompanied by the British Political Adviser, and a few British armoured cars put in a discreet appearance during the visit, all of which facts undoubtedly assisted in preserving order in an area lying on our lines of communication. The murderer is still at large, and the authorities pin their faith to having him surrendered eventually by the Kurds among whom he is hiding. ^ The Acting Chief of gendarmerie here stated definitely to “is ^ Majesty’s consul that his men would not go in ouriuit, as their present policy was to stay on the main roads only. Meanwhile ^ the son of A’azami has been appointed in his father’s place, chiefly as a gesture to show that authority will be upheld. There was another incident on the main Bagdad-Kerman- shah road on June 28th aoout 10 miles west of Bhahabad, when a car containing Iranian representatives of the A*n a lo-Iranian Company was helu up by a few armed Kurds, two persons killed and the remainder robbed. Enquiries show that the'attempt was really staged against a car expected to be passing that day with a large sum of money for the wages of the labourers working on the British road-making scheme in the district. 5. Two5. Two more Kurdish chieftains, itashid Sultan and Rashid Agha of the Rallchani tribe, have recently-‘keen allowed to return from Tehran to this area. The Ustandar professes to have no anxiety about these two, but it ia a fact that some of the returning chieftains soon become a nuisance or a danger to authority here. His Majesty's Legation at Tehran is fully alive to the problem, but it appears that the Ministry of Justice is almost anxious to have these undesirables leave the capital and return to their old haunts. Responsible local authorities however realise that the old tribal systems and their cohesion were dealt a bad blow by the ex-Shah* s radical and repressive policy. The old heads were mostly cut off, and a crop of weaker characters has resulted, respected by few and owing allegiance or respect to nobody, ready to plunder their own sub-tribes or to attack others in order to make up for the years of poverty and suppression* IRAL IM ADMIRI3TRATI0L. 6. During the first three v/eeks of June there were hardly any responsible officials in Kermanshah, except for the Ustandar, Amir-i-Kull, who is admittedly a figure-head and incapable of handling any administrative problems without the assistance of his Farmandar, Qiami. Unfortunately the latter was away all the month, and it is said that he refuses to return here, although every one realises that he is the most suitable official in Iran for the post. His energy and honesty have got him into trouble with the other officials here, backed as they are by the power ful hoarding and profiteering merchants and land-owners, and the intrigues of Majidzadeh, the local Director of Finance, coupled with lack of support from the Ustandar, have apparently made his position untenable. Yet without a capable Farmandar, in this important agricultural area, the situation is likely to go quickly from bad to worse particularly as regards the proper collection of the wheat and grain harvest, and of ghee and other staple foods, as also the efficient distribution of sup plies in Kermanshah itself and in the iiearby districts. Largely owing to these intrigues, the quality of the bread has lately deteriorated badly, the Municipality and the Economic Department each blaming each other for this state of affairs, while the un controlled bakers and millers make large profits. Great hoarded stocks of ghee are known to exist in the town, while the retail price has risen to 115 rials per batman, putting it out of the reach of most of the population. Largely as a result or repre sentations made by this Consulate, a meeting of officials and merchants was held at which it was agreed that 15 per cent of % local stocks of ghee should be retained for local consumption, to be sold under official auspices at 80 rials per batman. The chief hoarders however insisted that this should apply only to quantities leaving the town for Tehran and other centres, and for a time took care not to export from local stocks but to divert supplies from the surrounding country districts direct to Hama dan without bringing them near Kermanshah • It was seen that no attempt whatever was being made by the local Finance Department to carry out the regulations laid down in the Tehran Government*s anti—hoarding laws, the intention of which seems to have been to keep down prices and complaints in the capital and to enable large reserves to be built up there while no steps are apparently taken to protect provincial interests. _,«hile sanc tion was ultimately obtained from the Ministry of the interior in Tehran to carry out the scheme of retaining 15 per cent, the intriguing Majidzadeh received telegraphic instructions from the Ministry of Finance to allow ghee to be exported from Ker manshah to Tehran without any let or hindrance, provided a per mit given in Tehran were produced by the merchants interested, or that is how he construes it in order to spite the Ustandar and other local officials.3* 7. At the beginning of the month, the local Finance Depai^tment received instructions to collect and send 2,000 tons of wheat from the Kermanshah district and g,500 tons from the outlying areas to Isfahan. Majidzadeh, the local Director, declared that there was no available wheat here, but sent about 500 tons barley instead, and than left for about ten days in the Bijar area, north of Hamadan, where he declared that 4,000 tons were available, if transport could be provided. 8. . On the 30th June two British officers arrived at Kerman- shah and one at Hamadan, specially detailed to supervise the collection of the Governments quota of wheat from landowners and tribesmen during the new harvest now beginning. Their purpose is intended to ensure the collection of the quota without undue truculence from the growers, especially in the tribal areas, and also to safegBard the growers irom the extortions, cheating and ill-treatment meted out by officials employed on this task in former years under the ex-^hah’s regime. Although these officers came here under the auspices of the Iranian Ministry of Finance, it is doubtful whether they will meet with any real assistance from the local Finance officials on the spot if it is thought that their own peculations will be seriously hindered, and it is to be feared that they may deliberately turn their presence into an allegation that the British dovernraent is behind the collection of grain for British rather than Iranian interests. The arrival of the officers however may enable wheat to be obtained in tribal districts such as the Kalhor, where otherwise the timorous Iranian officials were refusing to go this year, especially after the recent murder of the Bakhshdar of Gilan, and where the tribesmen are known to be saying that they will surrender as little grain as possible to the Government this year. 9. During the greater part of June General Shahbakhti, G.0.0 Kermanshah, was absent in Tehran, as were the Ghief of Gendarmerie and the Chief of Police. It is said that an expected change of Government in Tehran was probably responsible for the exodus, but while the two former returned here on June 23rd, Colonel Arta, the unpopular police chief, was replaced by Colonel Assefi, until recently Chief of Police at Ardebil. General Shahbakhti professes to be anxious about the stagnation of the administration here, and to be in favour of the urgent return of the energetic Qiami, but it is perhaps noticeable that he is interfering less in local affairs than he was wont to do before his visit to Tehran. Whether this indicates at all that the central Government are aware of the unsatisfactory position here, in an important centre in the British xone, and are in no more of a hurry to amend matters than they were in the Rezaieh area this spring until things reached a deplorable climax, is a somewhat randem line of thought. Certain it is that some of the local officials by their failure to use their powers to check hoarding, unnecessary adulteration of bread or flagrant profiteering and price-raising here, lay themselves open to suspicion of wishing to cctuse trouble. The Economic Department says that bad bread is due to lack of Municipal control over the bakers, wh6 filch a proportion of the good flour supplied, but the Municipality retort that the flour given out by the economic Department is already much adulterated. The Department of Justice say that they cannot take action against hoarders or adulterators because neither Municipality nor Economic Department will bring a proper case against offenders, and moreover until the end of the month they declared that the local Courts had received no instructions whatever to \ carry out the Anti-hoarding laws passed in March , or the regul ations which appeared in the Ministry of Justice Gazette on June 4th. All departments seem determined to obstruct any improve ment of conditions, and seem to take a pleasur*e in flouting the easy-goingeasy-boing Uetandar. The latter some time ago brought a case against a lorry-owner for damage sustained by his car, but when -v the case came up for hearing, it was found that the dossier had been H lost M by the police. The Governor-Oeneral also had a notorious landowner of bhahabad arrested for theft of certain property belonging to the murdered bakhshdar A’azami and brought to Kermanshah, but the Court immediately gave orders for his release. There are those who think that only a /ilitary Governor or local military regime can remedy such a state of things, but it is not certain that this cure would not be as bad as the diseas* judging from recent experiences in other parts of Kurdistan. 10. it is learnt that the detested Major Isfundiar Khan Sayar ¥» 7 ho was thought to be going to Rowansar as viiicl oi Gendarmerie there, has been moved from this area , to the great relief of the inhabitants. After several months witout a Governor, the Qhah- abad area is now to have as Karraandar a certain Colonel Tabatabai, who will act as a civilian official. He was formerly bakhshdar of ^asr-i-chirin and knows that district and its inhabitants, out is said to be old and unenterprising. His appointment however iiiay be a saxer one than that of the Kalhor chiexs who were at one time intriguing for the post. He will have a difficult time un less the Tehran Government show more despatch and goodwill than hitherto in settling the question of the return or re-distribution of the nhahabad properties seized by the ex—Chah, as Disgruntled tribal leaders such as &gt;jiiir nakhsus anG. nariin Ijavouu.ian are complaining that they and their families are being kept in poverty and debt, while theh tribesmen are probably wondering why the ^ Government should apparently be reaping' the profits of this year s harvest once again, when the ex—»ihah was driven out nearly a year ago. It is commonolace knowledge that the Bakhshdars in Kurd istan, some with difficult and delicate tasks, have received no pay for five or six months, and some are talking of throwing up their posts. Much more unfortunate are people liice the minor officials of the Kermanshah Municipality, who have received only 1% pel’ cent of their pay, which is all they have to live on, during the last three months. The annual Municipal budget, which should have been fixed on March ki'Cnd or soon alter, has not yet been agreed upon in Tehran. Meanwhile in the Finance and gcono: ic department at least S30Q d&gt;f the 500 employees in this area are admitted to be redundant, while some only attend at their office once a month - to collect their puy* AGR1 0 OLT U RK . .. . . j j., TIT TToI is being done locally to give £he impression tnat the coming harvest is a poor one, especially in the frontier districts. k,hile°the short rainfall and heat have done some damage in the asr-i-^hirin area, the campaign is undoubtedly intended to excuse small deliveries of grain to the Government so that more may be smuggled into Iraq or hoarded underground in the villages. The ravages of tae ^, aemx :, beetle have been much exaggerated, and the Director of Agriculture estimated the damage caused thereby at less than 2 per cent. Over the whole district the harvest prospects may still be estimated at aoout M'S or 80 per cent of a good iiormal crop, especially in the Hamadan and other high districts where the weather has been cooler. RRQP AQ-Afli DA . 15. A good deal of printed British propaganda was distributed here during the first half of the month. The nightly broadcast of the B.B.C. and Tehran news in Persian in a disused cinema-hall continues to have an audience of 250 or 300. Means are unfortunately not available -or having a powerful outdoor broadcast, which would be much more suitable in the hot weather. A cinema-van arrived from the Public Relation b Bureau in this district early in the month and carried out a tour along the main road to the •rao frontier and back. The performances were &gt;nar*ed in Rerman- shah by hooliganism on the part of small boys (not organised obstruction) and by the continual breakages of the old and unsuitable news-reel films supplied from Cairo. The locally trained Iranian operator is hardly capable of carrying out such a sKilled task, and it is to be feared that the potentially very useful experiment will not last for long in such hands. The van is now in the Hamadan area. ivilSCELLAdhOUS* a; A Russian military journalist named Colonel Grerusalimsky visited Xermanshah during the week-end of June 6 th and had several interviews with the British Corps Commander and other military officers. He writes articles for 'RED STAR” and 'PRAVDA and was understood to be going on to the nhwaz area. b; Pending the construction of a proper military cemetery, two more British soldiers were buried in the Consulate garden. Both were killed by armoured vehicles overturning on the narrow roads here. c&lt; Protests have been made (even by Iranian residents) about the scandalous overcharging of British Troops b^' local shop keepers. Three times the proper price for fruit is not uncommon. Unfortunately local contractors have been allowed to charge iexcessive prices in regular contracts with British military supply officers who totally neglected to consult either His kajeety* s Consul or the x^olitical Adviser beforehand, as they might have done. d ; On dune 27tb Major Bower of the P. A. D. Section in Be i-dad visited Kerman shah axid discussed with the Mayor and the i/.O.C. the question of air-raid precautions. The authorities professed to be ready to have a practice black-out and to think out me-ns of combating incendiary bombs, but it is practically certain that they will do nothing unless obliged. They reel sure that a black-out (which could never be half effective here) would lead to robberies and disorders, the local police being what they are, and it is in fact almost certain that with the present crisis in Libya any simulacrum however factitioue of an air-raid would help the enemy* s game in the town. Most inhabitants feel that the war is far too close to their innocent selves already, and do not love ns the better for it. F, A. G. Cook. h. b. m. ocnstJL.

Meanwhile the gram remains in the open, ready to be stolen in many areas by marauding kurds, or to be hidden away or sold to hoarders unuer the pretext that it has been stolen. The dishonesty and atmosphere of corruption ana deception which prevails therefore stultifies collection even when wheat is available. i eanwhile warmsnehah and even smaller centres hardly have enough bread for their dally needs, and nobody apparently gives a thought W the needs of the capital and other parte of the country • uring the month there have boon bread riots at fshave&lt;id, ^alaylr, /Uisadabad and Xurina, ail small centre* in wheat-producing «r^as.

HIS Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Aifairs and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of his monthly diary for September 1942. . ^ Kermanshah, October 7, 1942. 3) Enclosure. Kermanshah Monthly Diary for September 1942. Kurdistan. THE general situation has been quieter of late, and no incidents have been reported since the holding up of an Anglo-Iranian Oil Company vehicle on the 5th September on the Paitak Pass. Some of the sub-tribes carry on the usual sniping of each other, and it is said that bullets crack most nights around the villages, marauders wishing to find out what defences oan be offered. The gendarmerie are, of course, completely absent from most parts of the district. The authorities would like to disarm certain tribes, but realise that this would offer immediate temptation to their neighbours for looting and paying off old scores. All the same there is confidential talk of dealing thoroughly with the Kalkhanis shortly when they come down from summer pastures, and of distri buting their chieftains in other parts of Persia on the Reza Shah model. If this means that people like the turbulent and mischief-making Shamseddin Haidari will be repressed, it is all to the good, but such intriguing and ambitious Kurdish personalities are generally “ well in ” with the Governor-General, Amir- i-Kull, so that little real action is taken. There has been some heart-burning among the Sinjabis, fifty of whose headmen came towards the end of the month to Kermanshah to complain of the excessive extortions of their bakshdar, Asker Khan, and to ask for his replacement. As usual, they also came to this consulate for sympathy and support, not forgetting to add that their oppressor was a well-known pro-German sympathiser (his father and uncles were, in fact, on the Turco-German side in 1916-17, and one uncle is in Germany now), and had been organising robberies of British camps and dumps in this district. Inner circles suggest, however, that Asker Khan has not been paying his proper “ dues ” to the Governor-General, and must therefore make room for someone more amenable. 2. It is surprising that conditions should be so quiet when official control is so exiguous. In some districts Kurdish headmen openly say that there is no Government these days, and certainly the authorities are flouted as far as smuggling and hoarding of wheat are concerned in many parts. Possibly the latter activities have kept them too busy for other mischief, which will come later. 3. There has been some robbing of British military camps, even radio-sets having been carried off, but sterner precautions have improved matters, and the presence of Assyrian guards (Iraq Levies) has no doubt had its effect, as they are known to tend to shoot first and challenge afterwards. At one time there was an idea of enrolling Kurdish guards on the system of setting a thief to catch a thief; setting a cat to guard bowls of cream would be an apter metaphor, and nothing has come of it. Persian A dministration. 4. The Governor-General, Amir-i-Kull, was ill during the greater part of the month, which was convenient for him in a way at a time when the Prime Minister in Tehran and the British Consulate at this end were worrying him to take strong measuies against his profiteering and hoarding friends and [35—32]2 r. pr acquaintances, which he has obviously no intention of doing. Most of t le oca government devolved upon the weak shoulders of the Governor Mustashan, w o continues to be well disposed towards us, but apparently incapable of carrying out any of our recommendations. General Shahbakti remains in the backgroun and piously declines to intervene in the civil administration; it is hard to ciedi him with innocent motives, and possibly he has no wish to take any unpopulai remedial action while he watches the said administration daily losing prestig^^ and ordinary respect in town and country. . 5. The unwanted Director of Finance, Majidzadeh, was very suddenly replaced at the beginning of the month by Mr. Shams Nakhai, who is reputed to be honest and intelligent, and who certainly has few illusions about the difficulties of his task at present, or about the characters of the local landowners and merchants who are out to thwart any attempts at proper efficient government. Towards the end of the month Kermanshah at last obtained a mayor m the person of Mr. Sharifi, an official from Tehran, who gives an impression of energy and certainly has dealt straightway a few strokes of a new broom in the Augean stables of the local municipality. He even ventured to confiscate some thousands of hoarded eggs, but the only result was a strike of egg-sellers for some days and higher prices than ever. . 6. A finance official from Ahwaz, named Ghulam Ali Khan Zanganeh, managed to transfer himself here during the month and called on the consulate to declare his unbounded loyalty. In the consulate’s opinion there are already too many of the Zanganeh family benefiting in this district from the elevated position of their obliging relative, the Amir-i-Kull, and as this new arrival brought with him an undesirable reputation for pro-Nazi leanings he was soon sent packing by our military authorities. Food Supply. 7. The wheat question remains depressingly where it was a month ago, and the combination of unprincipled landowners and corrupt local officials may be said to have defeated the Tehran Government’s attempts to secure the proper quota of grain at official prices. This consulate and its liaison officers have done their best to improve matters, but have rather found themselves in the position of a referee in a disreputable football match, with no whistle, no power to stop the play, and no authority to send anyone off the field. All appeals either to the local authorities or to the' Persian authorities in Tehran to apply their own laws or to arrest even a handful of the known worst offenders have met with no response, except more exhortations and empty threats. The result is that at the end of September, with all the harvest gathered and threshed and largely hidden away, the official Kermanshah stocks of wheat were under 350 tons, or less than ten days’ supply for the town. In the smaller country towns the position is worse, and in the midst of a wheat-growing district bread is either unobtainable at times, or sold at three times or more the official rate. Meanwhile, Tehran circles are insisting on their urgent need to take wheat for themselves from the areas a few miles east of Kermanshah, and the local officials are insisting equally strongly on their intention not to allow this to happen until local supplies for the winter have been first collected—a slow and difficult task in present conditions. The Tehran attitude is understandable, but would be more logical if they had done anything at all effective during the last three months to see that the quite good local harvest in other parts of the Kermanshah area had not been smuggled out or hidden away under the eyes of their police, gendarmerie and military forces. 8. Following a certain amount of exhortation and reprimand from Tehran, including a personal message from the Prime Minister, the local officials on the 15th September made a show of trying to force the recalcitrant landowners into signing the undertakings to deliver their fair surpluses of wheat which they should^have signed in August. Amid much moaning and protest, the landlords signed for miserable quantities of between a tenth and a quarter of the amounts assessed for each by the Finance Department, which in turn were, of course, less than the real available amounts in proportion to the “ inducements ” proffered to the official assessors beforehand. The trick, however, was so evident and so unsatisfactory that even the Governor-General was forced to insist on larger undertakings, possibly because it was foreseen that otherwise the local needs of the town would not be met. No one, of course, pretends to care a rap whether the needs of the capital and other unproductive parts of Persia will be assisted in any way—unless these are willing later on to pay inflated black market rates for the grain now being held back and hidden away. The uncontrolled price has now risen so high (1,000 rials to 1.200 rials per kharwar) that it is repeatedly3 r \ A reported that wheat is being smuggled back again into Persia over the Iraq border at 900 rials. There are many districts along the border from (^asr-i- Shirin southwards to Pusht-i-Kuh where the peasants have no wheat even 101 seed, and little prospect at present of being assisted by the Finance Department. 9. As a result of instructions received from Tehran, the arrangement at the end of the month was that, if landlords would not sign their proper undertakings, 4^ie Finance Department’s statement of the quantity assessed in each individual ^ase would carry full weight, just as if duly signed for. It remains to be seen, however, whether the obstinate landowners will deliver those amounts, as so tar they have had no reason to fear any real official sanction or retribution. 10. They had plenty of inducement to resist, on the contrary, when the news leaked out of the Tehran authorities’ intention to purchase as much wheat as possible on the open market througih the Agricultural Bank. That scheme has been shelved, but the effect has been unfortunate, and in any case it is known that there is now a free market in Khuzistan, not far away. Besides this it is becoming known that the Royal Engineer authorities in charge of road-building and defence works in this area are arranging to buy wheat at uncontrolled prices for their Persian labourers. This should theoretically come from peasants surpluses, leaving landlords surplus to the Finance Department, but most small peasants’ surpluses have been already sold to private hoarders, and it is the landlords who will benefit, „ „ 1 . . . H Jt is difficult to see what will be the outcome of all this, unless hunger and bread-riots in the winter and spring. Even now the caches of the hoarders could be discovered, but it will be difficult to find them once snow has fallen, and by then transport to the needy areas will be difficult, if not impossible. Economic Situation. 12. While wholesale prices fluctuate from week to week in accordance with the desires or fears of the merchants, retail prices continue to rise. Wages, of course, are having to follow, and a day labourer now* insists on 10 or 11 lials a day, against 7 or 8 a month or two ago. Artisans are putting up their prices, and a pair of ordinary locally-made boots is now 200 rials, the lower middle class, such as clerks and minor Government employees, are feeling the pinch, and the poorest classes must find it hard to live. Any day m the mam street one may see children practically naked, and wretched begging women who are hardly decently covered by one ragged garment. 13. Hoarding, corruption and maldistribution are to blame tor the high prices of many commodities, but the increasing needs of the British forces in the locality cannot but have their effect on the prices of fruit, vegetables, meat, eggs and firewood. Careful comparisons show that the cost of li\mg has increased by over 90 per cent, since a year ago. ^ome ai tides, such as buttei, rice, milk, potatoes, ghee, have risen in price by lo0 per cent, or 200 pei cent, during the last six months. . . . 14. Peasants who have sold their surplus wheat to private hoarders at “ black ” rates are happy, but may be less so when they find that their money will purchase less and less. Peasants from the non-agricultural districts who relied on wool and gum tragacanth have heard of a welcome improvement in prices durino 1 the month. It is said that enquiries from Russian wool-buyers and better chances for the export of gum to New York and London are responsible for this change from recent inactivity. . , , , , n on 15 As usual in the autumn buying period there has been a shortage ot small currency in the town, but this year the position has become much more acute, owing to the spending of money by British troops. The Bank Mellie have done little or nothing to remedy matters. Political. 16. The Soviet Consul, M. V. Chvetsov, was transferred from Kermanshah at very short notice in mid-September. He was instructed to report to his embassy in Tehran, without knowing to what new post he was appointed. No successor has arrived, but the senior vice-consul is acting for the time being. 17. It is fairlv certain that pro-Nazi feeling here has recently declined, at least among the civilians. The more intelligent confess that they no longer trust German news and propaganda, and there are signs that the B.B.C. news in Persian every evening is being more widely listened to. It is already being taken for granted that the Germans have failed to advance far enough this summer to conquer the Caucasus before winter sets in, and on the whole people are relieved that Persia is spared from scenes of fighting for another spell. The news of theGerman leaflet raid on Pahlevi soon arrived here, but caused no particular reaction. Although pro-Nazi feeling has declined for the moment, it would be a mistake to Suppose that the inhabitants are becoming correspondingly more pro-Ally. On the other hand, there are signs that the younger generation are wanting to learn more English, both in school and private classes, and are less keen to learn French as a pripcipal language. Propaganda. ^ 18. A shop has now been hired by the consulate in the main street for the display of posters and photographs and for the reading and distribution of pamphlets, &amp;c. So far attendance has been gratifying, although composed chiefly of schoolboys and young men. 19. About 200 people come to listen to the B.B.C. news every evening in the consulate’s broadcasting hall, but most of them slip away immediately after wards instead of staying to hear the Baku, Tehran and Delhi news bulletins (the latter at 9 p.m. being somewhat too late for our purpose). 20. The Soviet Consulate has arranged with the police for a small hoarding at the side of our own in the town square. But whereas the British display is mostly of attractive coloured posters and large photographs with little or no letter-press, the Russian is rather like an illustrated newspaper and seems to attract much less attention. General. 21. The main street of Kermanshah, which carries a great deal of our military traffic is falling into a bad state of repair. The mayor has asked for it to be asphalted by Kampsax or the British roadmaking authorities, but there is no chance whatever of this being done at present. 22. An interesting sidelight on the present state of Persian administration was given when the Governor-General recently asked His Majesty’s Consul for his good offices in trying to obtain a Persian exit visa for an influential Persian friend of his who wished to make the pilgrimage to Kerbela in Iraq. The friend had duly applied through the local chief of police, who had had to refer the application to Tehran, and it was realised even by the Governor-General that the chances of a reply within a reasonable period were small, unless the consulate here and the British Legation in Tehran might be willing to intervene.

By the beginning of the month such surplus vsheat as had not already been sold to Iraq haa been mostly hidden away by the landlords la their villages. They let out screams of surprised rage when their friend the aovernor-ueneral, badgered wee* after week by u .n. Jonaul and the Political dviaer, was constrained to arrest 52 of them, including two of his uncles, much against | his Aill. ithin a few days he mana^eu tu let 40 of them go, ' in spite ol l telegram of contpr-atulation from the rims s inister on the firm stand he had supposedly tauen, sad apologised almost tearfully to them for the shock he had caused them.

The governor began to talk about a rationing scheme, in order to keep away the thousands of peaiaata coming into Aeruaiohah to buy cheap bread, but said that he needea £1,000 to print the cards :uid could not obtain sanction for the scheme from Tehran* The consulate hfto since managed to the affair but of his hands and into tho^e of the A ay or. it was then proposed to mix 80 &gt; oi barley flour with the broad, in order to force middle- class hoarders of wheat and flour to feed themselves rather than eat coarse bread from the public bakeries.

Kermanshah Diary for October suggests that if famine is to be avoided in this important town both the Governor-General and the Governor should be dismissed and replaced by officials who will attempt to deal effectively with hoarders and food profiteers. Reinstatement of Colonel Farroufch as Chief of Gendarmerie might also help matters. 2. If you agree, please discuss with Sheridan and urge Prime Minister to take immediate action. You could remind him that Persian Government cannot expect us to fulfil our obligations under the Wheat Declaration unless they also fulfil theirs. 5. In addition to their general incompetence^and corruption, following more specific charges can be brought against these two officials:- (a) Failure to carry out Anti-Hoarding Law by releasing without enquiry most of the landlords arrested for hoarding; (b) Failure to provide bread for workers at the Refinery, an important war interest.

The Gove nor-Gexierul, Arair-i- .all, left the district | lor Tehran at the beginning ox the month and has not returned, iThere are reasons for believing that he will not uo so, and few ! people will be oorry except his own greedy relations and hazigera- i on. During his six oi 5 seven month’ tenure he has uone little but feather his own nest, ana iii spite ol the inline ice his lame envoys aaong the tribes, has been at the oeek and call of every undesirable element with no thought oi uoin to anything lor the O ood govei iuaent of his province. 4e rai^ht however &gt;lcad with r soiae justice that he has been ill, that the central Government have e ivan him no pay whatsoever and very little oac ing, thaw every single ufiicial around him has been similarly corrupt, Vnd^' that he could not poaclbly have carried u , O oou gover\uQCiii in ..7 present circumsta .ccs even ii he has tried.

POOD 1U d?LY. 6 * As in the rest oi rersia, there has been little real improvement during the month, Q Ua what there may have been ia due to Providence and not to any oi the Persian officials charged v-ith the task of assuring proper supplies. For the first half oi the month the scenes around the oread-shops coutiuuad, while the ba ers continued to steal a large part oi the flour supplied to thcmi, with the conniva.ee o. the municipal officials, wheat stopped coming into the town in oonseuqeuce of a misguided tele gram rr^m the impul-ive Minister of Fooustufls, instructing his oi icials here not to pay the new agreed higher prices to those landlords who had not carried out the whole ol th^ir uiiuertc inga to deliver wheat? xixikaxaLfitax^tKiaa, aiia this not only for the current year, but ior two years past. If the landlords had been falling over themselves to deliver wheat at the new price, such £ suaaen auti unexpected applicatisn of pressure mi ht h^ve been lunaerc-tuiiaable, but such *so net the ca^e, ana deliveries were coming in very slowly, with ocores oi landlords still rcliisine, to si^n any unaertaiving© ui all. The result oas ou course to stop all deliveries in town an^ country, ao .-oil us all new si e natures oi undertaiia^s, auu. the landlcru© deciaea that Mr. Farroukh was merely tricking them out of the higher price, after having tried to raa-ie them uisclooc their hidden stoc ls. Kven jworse, he also gave orders that the higher prices were not to be paid ior wheat delivered by these who hau leased agricultural Ittdd this last year, but only t . tars. It j pears that the letter as a class were annoyed that the tenants who had paid rents in. accordance with the lower prices ior ..heat idling a year | ago, should benefit on a level with themselves. Uiitil this 0 re-tiy class anu their satellites are removed, irom the powerful control they exercise on the country, there is little hope for Persia. It has ta en a ra,ath to get these two stupid sets of instructions cancelled, but much dumatie hue been done. Little confidence can remain in any act of the government, and it is largely the fear ,1 famine next spring which prevents iraproveme-it&gt; encourages private hoarding ana makes prices of all cofitnoaities rise higher ana higher almost each week. 7. As mentioned above, a private buyer arrived in Kermaushah from the Ministry oi Finance, sent to buy «heat where all it© officials during the last four months hove failed. Mr. Naamani, the free-lance in question, will receive a commission of 100 rials per ton cn ..hat he buys up to 9000 tons one l&amp;b rials per-3- ton on the iiext OQ touB. This total of ll # 000j toniw| tow ot^ba to oe oil icially reberved lor the needo ol Kerma4na -&lt;lk*t*do t f ana any wheat be may buy beyond that will ^ain him 200 rials per ton ana be sent to Tehran* ^oiiefcte nave been made with a buyer lor enenao^ aua Haiaadan. These buyers ma. e boa^tiul promises of what they will do, and send ^lowin^ eoounta of what ' wheat they have aiscovereu ana expect to buy, but unless they have^ •much m^rc. oac ving than the loee a had Tehran, their achievements are 11 ely to be disappointing. needless to sey, they have immediately drawn down upon theaeelves the hostility oi all the landlords, except the biggest ones who have already ta, ei step© with oflicialdom here and in Tehran to make the iselves &gt;erfectly sale. These buyers appear to oe obtaining some &gt;romise 6 to deliver wheat, and may obtain a certain amount of grain from small owners -ho need the money. They may also uiscover the whereabouts oi conside able stocks of hidaen wheat, but that will not be very useful unless the authorities will make up their nunas to collect it. Ana a, ter all this effort, little e,oou will result unlebb transport can be ve y much better organised than it is at present in the uroVinces. 8 . Tehran coutrols a certain amount oi transport, and in spite ol its repeated promises not to remove wheat from country districts until local neeaa are assured, ha© been tryin^ to carry of. wheat wherever it could ilnd it for the urgyif^t neeas oi the capital. Much has one from the Hn-auan and urveh area*, out it is possible that the aei.cit can oe made up there. In the Ksxmanshah a ea this is not the case at present, atia so fierce has been the hoarding and cheating that even if all the landlords ahoulc carry out their signed unae takings, there will still be a local dencit oi 7 X)0 tons or so. /hen four lor iea came from Tehran to nan^avar, ne«r i^emanshah, to remove wheat ana barley, the tnhftbitf&amp;S iw-rcibly urevented ai^y grain from leaving.

POLITICAL Kurdistan 'remains quiet, although there are the usual number of intrigues going on among some of its petty chieftains. The threatened spurt of disarmament by Colonel Gulshayan has not materialised; like most Persian military men, he preferred to sit on the main road, and stayed at Sar-i-Pul Zuhab. Meanwhile it is reliably reported that the turbulent Kalkhanis have arranged to deposit their surplus rifles with Yakub Beg of the Wala’dbegis while the talk of disarming them lasts. The intriguing Shamseddin Haidari, sitting under easy surveillance in Kermanshah (its easiness must cost him a lot of money with the Governor-General and the military ‘ authorities), is supposed to have sent this advice, and also to have advised the outlaw Jahangir Assad and. his eighty armed retainers to take refuge in the 'Taladbegi area. . - 2. Mohamed Amin Beg, bakhshdar of Avroman and a some of t the late Jaafar Sultan, has spent most of the month at Kernanshah having teeth extracted. He is somewhat jealous of his brother Kerim’s command of gendarmerie at Paveh, and wants some of his own - or rather wants to have their pay. He as^ed H.M.Consul to speak to Colonel Mirfindirislci on the subject, with the result that the latter is hinting at re-introducing, regular Persian gendarmerie officers there, which is not at all to his taste. Amin Beg also asked for some official pay in’order to keep up his status as Bakhshdar; the Tehran Government’s reply was that he could have £4 per month (Bials 500), taken from the Governor-General’s secret-service funds of Rials £,000 per month, which goes to illustrate once more their attitude towards the Kurdish border problems with which they profess to be so concerned when it is a question of nagging the Iraqi Government in Bagdad. 3. The chieftain Asghar khan^of the Sinjabis (a doubtful character who is a protege of the Governor General, Amir-i-Kull, and so is untouched) seems to have been touring among neighbouring tribes for some reason or other. It may be a coincidence that the Javanrudis, Babajanis and VValadbegis are reported to have made a joint pact to resist forcibly any Persian attempt at disarming them, and the Avromanis (who admit to 2,000 rifles) are thought to be in this. IRANIAN ADMINISTRATIO N 4. The chief item of news is the arrival of Mr. Mohamed Sallahi from Qum as new Governor of Kermanshah. HeHe is a friendly and energetic official who has set to work with most unwonted courage and determination, but he admits already that the present forces of- inertia, inefficiency and vested interest are almost too much for him, and says that if he does not receive full support from Tehran (he seems to be a close acquaintance of M. Soheily) he will immediately resign- His first act was to drive one of the most hoarders and food- profiteers into resigning from the so-called Food-supply Committee here, but next day strong pressure was brought to bear upon him by the Governor-General, Amir-i-Kull, whose house-servant the profiteer in question, now enormously rich, used tio be- Hr- Sallahi has written several scathing reports to the new Prime Minister on the various officials here, particularly on Mr- Rukni the venal and ineffective Director of supply, and on Colonel Mirfindiriski, the corrupt Chief of Gendarmerie, who protects hoarders of wheat instead of arresting them, and is reliably said to be hiring out his official motor trucks to private traders at a very large profit to himself. Needless to say the new Governor has quickly seen through the arch-corrupt and completely useless Governor-GTeneral, against whose continuance in office* this Consulate protested long ago, and who is surpassing even his previous records for getting rich and helpihg his relatives to get rich as hurriedly as possible- Svery important*landowner, every hoarding merchant, and a good many intriguing tribesmen have him taped and bribed, and no improvement is possible in any department until he is removed. 5. The new Mayor, Mr. Morteza Abuzar, is a surprisingly youthful official, brought here by the new Governor and obviously completely undeh his control. The regulation of the daily bread supply is now outside the municipal province, although it might be a good thing if it returned there again after this change of Mayors, and as for the regulation of prices, offences for shortweight, water supply and hygiene, the new Mayor confesses he can do little or nothing, since the most flagrant and repeated offenders whom he presents to the local courts are let off with Ridiculously petty fines after a mockery of a Trial. 6'. A new commander of the local garrison has arrived, one Colonel Davalou, to replace the colourless Colonel Gulshayan, left here in January by Marshal Shahbakti- The new man brings a reputation for energy, straight forwardness and friendliness towards the British. Already he has thrown out and even arrested most of the military medical staff for the dirty state of their sick quarters and arrangements* It remains to be seen how he will deal with the incorrigible gang of young officers whose anti-British talk and activities are reported to have increased again lately. There is no sign as yet of General Zorrabi, who is supposed to be *coming to Kermanshah from Khorramabad to command the new Divisional area. FOOD SUPPLYFOOD 3UPPLY ?• The stock of official wheat for public baking continued to decrease steadily during the month, and by the end of February stood at zO tons, or less than one day’s requirements. The collection during the last week of the month totalled less than a quarter of a ton, although there are scores of landlords still owing hundreds of tons between them to the authorities and still undergoing little or no pressure to deliver, thanks to the bribes they distribute* There is a certain amount of barley in hand, which is now going to form 70/b or more of the bread-content, and a little wheat-flour has been found by some miraculous means, after everyone had said that the official reserve of forty tons had* 'disaprjeared'* For the next few weeks I Kermanshah is going to live more precariously than ever, since the weather has recently been so bad that no grain can be transported from the villages even when it has been collected there* Valuable weeks and months of fine weather were completely wasted, and even now little real effort is being made to organise animal transport in view of the shortage of lorries. Owners of donkeys and minor officials of the Supply department combine to force up the cost of moving grain to prohibitive levels. This suits the big landowners, who wish to see acute shortage and famine conditions in the town and countryside in order to keep up the blac v market price of wheat; now 7,000 rials or over £54 per ton, as against the official price of 3,500 rials. It also suits the holders of alternative foodstuffs such as ghee, rice, beans, peas, etc. of which literally thousands of tons are known to be hoarded in Kermanshsh itself, while prices remain at fantastic levels. Rationing makes very slow progress, and is attended by the usual scandals. Bribes have to be paid to get a coupon for tea or sugar, and many people are said to have obtained two or three coupons by paying. In the bazaar there is an active daily 'black bourse' in coupons. Five committees are now working on a scheme for bread-rationing, and it is said that the well-to-do, the merchants and those known to have private wheat-stocks will not receive bread-coupons; but nobody of course believes this. After about two months without proper issues of tea and sugar, a meagre ration has lately been given out. There are perpetual jostling throngs around the Government cloth-shops. The ordinary people, including the very poor and the labouring classes, now cannot afford anything like proper supplies of rice, ghee, tea or sugar; vegetables are of course at present scarce, and meat has recently been practically unobtainable in the town; only bread remains, and this is'often almost uneatable, while it looks like shortly becoming unobtainableunobtainable unless a miracle tastes place* Public exasperation is undoubtedly growing, and there are, stories widely current that in the Russian occupied zone of Iran things have not been allowed to come to this pass for the poor people and. the working classes* Every day sees scores of hungry peasants and their ragged children tramping into the squalid town from the villages, where conditions are reported even worse, and where all available grain has been bought up and hidden,by speculators* 9. The only remedy is firm action by the central Government, carried out locally by the most forcible measures if necessary* But this is impossible with the present drift of all normal administration. The supply department must be cleansed from top to bottom, some of its worst representatives imprisoned and publicly disgraced, the police and gendarmerie ordered to seize hoards of foodstuffs under severe an£ definite threats of punishment for failure, before any improvement can be effected. Otherwise it is difficult to see how any amount of importation of British and American wheat can help the position,* since wheat is not the only foodstuff missing, and the probability of its arriving soon in large quantities seems to have no eifect on the continued hiding-away of grain and its rise in i price* Even now it is obvious that arrangements are afoot to hide away and corner the coming autumn's harvest, which promises to be one of,the most abundant in living memory. Every landowner in any district tells an enquirer that while sowing is exceptionally good in every area but his own, sowings have been poor or below average in his particular villages, and that, more spring sowings are needed urgently* This specious story of course has two aims: to persuade the innocent enquirer that there cannot.possibly be any hoarded grain whatever in that district, and to disparage any idea that,there will be an appreciable harvest or surplus of grain there at any rate this coming autumn* It is sometimes said that hoarded grain cannot be kept more than one season, but this is not true of this dry region, where if properly stored it has been known to keep three years or more, the big landowners are determined to make a good thing out of this war,as they did out of the last, and nothing but force will stop them. 10. The new Governor of Kermanshah was supplied with certain addresses of hoarded rice and sugar by this Consulate, and set out to find them. He managed to seal up some stores, but the biggest hoarders remained untouched by his agents, who said they could not trace their stocks. Nevertheless his action had an effect in reducing the inflated bazar prices a liutle* - hoard of 50 tons of wheat at Mahidasht was reported to the Supply Department here, but it is known that instead oi seizing it their inspector took a bribe of nearly 10,000 rials from the hoarder to leave it alone. The Governor-General has been promising for some time to go to Senendej to try and collect wheat from the recalcitrant landlordslandlords there* but wanted to be accompanied by Consul and Lt.Col. Fletcher, the Political Adviser, in addition to the Consular Liaison Officer, Mr# Bourne* This was obviously in order to throw any unpopularity he might* incur in his fellow landlords’ eyes upon the British. However, he now says that a party from Tehran have been there and have been unable to obtain any wheat, so declines to go himself. He admits that he is unwilling to cause ”jealousy' i#e# unpopularity towards himself, and when pressed threatens to resign and go to Iraq on pilgrimage* Such is the chief official in Western Iran, who was sent here specially to collect wheat to help the starving capital and 4 other towns of Persia. ECONOMIC CONDITIO T S. 11. These, as already described', are bad and if anything worsening. The streets of full of hungry and half-naked beggars of both sexes, and about fifteen destitutes die daily of hunger and misery and have to be buried by the municipality* Typhus is increasing daily, and cases numbered 1,000 ’in the town on February 27th; the 'Lion &amp; Sun' hospital has had to close temporarily, as nearly all the doctors and nurses are down with the disease* Continual cold rain and snow during the past month has made conditions worse for the poor, who * huddle together at night in stables and caravanserais and infect each other with lice* 12. Prices of tea, sugar and rice soared to impossible levels during the month, but dropped slightly towards the end. As merchants cannot expect remunerative sales at such prices, it is possible that they are holding in the expectation of depreciation of currency, which is often mentioned. In fact, with the Government’s steady refusal to control prices or to impose proper taxation of the wealthy classes, it is hard to see how inflation can be avoided indefinitely. Transport is now controlled, so that private traders have to pay very large bribes to get their merchandise accepted, which all adds to retail cost. Permits can be easily obtained for sending foodstuffs towards Tehran, but supplies from Tehran and other towns are becoming increasingly difficult to arrange. 13. A good deal of smuggling still goes on from Iraq, chiefly of metal, hardware and electrical goods. Bars of tin, worth 300 rials per kilogram in Iraq fetch 400 rials here, and if they can be got to Tehran are * sold at 600 rials per kilogram. It is reported that the Supply Department, for a sum of Rials 2,000 a time are willing to describe them as 'foodstuffs' and issue a special transport-permit accordingly. 14. It is not known yet how the new transpo’rt control arrangements are wording, as everyone takes it for granted that any restrictions will be flouted and evaded^ a wn + K v&gt;r&gt;iv^ps• The local director must be an ob ject oFenvy indeed. Lorry drivers are said to go off with nartlv-loaded trucks covered by waybills, and then make money handsomely on filling up the gaps with private goods. The profit on moving ghee from here to Tehran is 40 rials per kilogram, so a merchant who can send onlv half a ton of it gains £160. The ? various control posts along the route each have to be squared , o. course. 15. Transactions between merchants in certain rroods such sb sugar and tea, in which stocks have to be declared monthly, however fictitiously, now have to be carefully transcribed in their books, owing to s. me nervousness of possible Government action later. A cheque is drawn for the purchase pric e calculated -t the official rate, and the balance is paid in cash to avoid written records. This trick is said to have been recommended from Tehran recently. In practically no cases are goods sold at the official prxces, and many commodities are no longer priced m the fortnightly Municipal printed list, as the mockery seems to be too great even for Persian acceptance* CHARITABLE RSLUSff. 16* This Consulate, under the aegis of the Anglo- Iranian Relief Committee' in Tehran, has been feeding over one thousand persons a day in the poorest quarters with soup and bread sold at half-cost. About a hundred people a dev are fed gratis by means of coupons distributee by certain iiullahs. Many shirts and cotton trousers have been given to the poorest and most naked seen in the streets, @ and 25 cotton suits distributed in the prison, where several prisoners were found completely naked except for a thin ptt&gt;ce of blanket and many others nearly so. 17. After much persuasion from the Consulate q nd vigorous action by the Political Adviser, the very badly-run Persian Poor-centre is being reorganised. „he funds had been exhausted at a remarkable rate, considering the meagre amount of good being done, hlle £arge number of well-to-do residents f ^clined to pay promised subscriptions totalling about £^,000 in all. The local officials having failed to remedy matters, the Political Adviser interviewed certain leading defaulters and obtained more than that sum within a :e days. As has been repeatedly said, the modern demoralised and disillusioned Persians only require a firm lead and firm handling, which 90^ of them would welcome, but m the important things we and the Russians seem to have to stand aside and decline to give it, vhile it is practically certain that the Americans will not give it either* PROPAGANDAPROPAGANDA /■N 18. The resounding Russian successes are the chief topic of discussion, (after the intolerable local econonic conditions and the impossible state of local administration), and our own propaganda, naturally pales before them. We have not much to offer at present except posters and magazines to which the local inhabitants have by now become used. A large sketch map of the Russian front with coloured lines and flags to show recent advances was prepared for the Consulate's propaganda shcp-window, and drew much attention, even Persian military officers stopping to examine it. Coloured portraits of Fing George VI have been selling readily at three rials and are to be seen in many shops and houses. 19. Most people 'are beginning to feel that the * Allies may win the war, but the inveterate pro-Nazis^ promise a German counter-stroke in the spring* possibly through Turkey. The withdrawal of British troops through Kermanshah towards Iraq tends to support this, idea, as does the fact that we continue to construct aerodromes in this area. 20. Local opinion is difficult to judge. ?/any leading officials now show outward friendliness to* the Consulate, but the ordinary resident still remains aloof. It has not been possible to form a local Anglo-Iranian relief committee* in spite of many approaches, but the reorganised Persian Poorhouse committee recently suggested that H.M.Consul be asked to join* it. One leading official gave a dinner party a few weeks ago to the small British community and to some British officers and made &amp; n effusive speech, but confidential information received a few days later said that he had reported adversely on a subordinate in his office for being too pro-British. There is a section of opinion which would like to see more active British intervention in Persian affairs, as the only remedy for present conditions, but among the military and the police there remains a hard core of anti-British feeling, ready to criticise our every action and to applaiid our every setback. One school-inspector recently ordered some artistic and wholly unobjectionable photographs of British aeroplanes* ships, tanks, etc. to be removed from one school where they were displayed as a gift from this Consulate. Action was tacen by the new Governor on our protesting, and the offender, as in ail such cases, &lt;immediately rushed round to claim that he had always been*one of our friends. * 30VI1ST ACTIVITIES. * * # * 21. Not so much has been heard of these during the month* The Soviet Consulate now circulates a journal ’’Friend of Iran” published in Tehran, and has put up a fewfew posters in the town* The Vice-Consuls are occasionally seen in the poorest quarters of the town, doubtless reporting on the misery seen there* An official reception was held at the Consulate to celebrate Red Army Day on February 23rd and all leading Persian officials (but practically no private individuals) attended* A large iced birthday cake bearing slogans in Russian made its appearance; according to the Consul it was an unexpected present from local Armenians* 22* A Soviet representative of the offi-cial 'Iransovtrans' transport organisation named Sergevich Ivanov has been appointed .at the Khaniqin-Khosrovi frontier post, ostensibly to speed up lorry traffic to Russia. As he speaks uieither Arabic, Persian or English, it _is difficult to see how he wm achieve this. GENERAL * 23* Some schoolboys recently .complained to the Political Adviser that they could not obtain 'passes' in their examinations without giving a bribe to the-ir teachers. Investigations showed this to be quite true. As a result, the Chief of Police visited the school and lectured the boys on having complained to a foreigner instead of to one of their own officials - as if every Persian schoolboy even did not know just how much use the latter course would, be* ■ * 24. It is now certain that about 600 tons of potatoes have been allowed to go rotten in the Government stores here through gross mismanagement, while, people are literally dying of hunger in the streets nearby.

It proved impossible howubor to transport the 2b tons needed per day tottoe main roan at Sahneh, 6ud the eituation during the last week of April was almost as bad as at any time. One day the bread dis tributed was a dirty grey colour, full of grit and said, prepared from musty rain-aamaged barley only, so bad that it coulu not be *iven away at this b naulate's charitable soup-kitchens. The weather is improving however, roads are less likely to be impassable for days together, and Mr. Bourne's atrenoue endeavours to obtain more transport are bearin* fruit. . lm This Consulate* s assertions that all this k dship exists in/In « albtrict atill poeaeSBin* nbunatmt hidaen wheat, nay In a tuv,n oontalnln a humireda of tons ol hourdea c.rni holue ood, «hetevtP vocixerouu voutea IntereatB in T* &gt;an and their venal newspaper hncke may say to lurelan ao 'aers.

The latter supplies ought to be uiverted to poor and hungry uistncts li .e Ilarn, which have suffered badly this winter. Reports from Iraq say that the cereal harvest there is so promising that supplies may later be exported or smuggled thence into Iran this year, contrary to *hat took place last autumn, and so the price here will further be kept in check. Coupled with the still very favourable harvest prospects in this country, almost all the facts conspire to aid any serious well-meant Government efforts to collect a proper share of the coming crop and avoid the misery and confusion oi this last season. As yet there are few signs that serious preparations are being made in this regard. There are ideas afoot for a few independent temporary Iranian inspectors to go into encn district and compute each landlord’s crop irorn the amount sown, in co-operation with the Supply Department ofncials. Unless there are checks ana counterchecks, this idea almost valueless; the landlords know every permanent old official and his P ice, and will soon make it worth the while of the temporary (and probably poorly-paid) inspector to write down their figures, not his own. Their proiits this year have been so huge, and the results of their dishonesty so successful, that they are sure to repeat their manoeuvres ii ocssible. The remedy is to provide enough British or American officers or officials ror a lew weeks, nut necessarily to take charge of the whole proceedings, but to act as a spur, a control and a kind of conscience 101 the miscellaneous investigators. There is also talK ol Government efforts to make forward contracts for the purchaoe of £ rain, whereas such contracts have been loroidden o private Persons. This may play into the hands of the biggest landlords ana the crooked politicians, by enabling them to spread the idea that the Government is over-anxious to obtain chough grain and hard put to it once more to carry Ou. i s detested collection schemes. It should not be forgot en that, despicable and unpatriotic as many of the landloiuo , many members of their class, especially those ol mode a means ana the few of accent character, have for years seen badly and unfairly treated and cheated by the Government and its hordes of thieving officials, ana many ol them ..ill ao aiiVthing/\ -y- r c^a*»ia«r the«fc«lvea eoapl«t4» nitwita ii they dlu aot avail thtroaelvea oi theac ©aay chances oi sslf-enrichaent.

When H^M? Consul and the Political Adviser visited the disturbed areas towards the end of June, they found a .ersian captain en«ri, eed there in spite of their former protests against sucn an impro er aopoifitmeut, and in s &gt;ito of Colonel Davalou* s promise ten days earlier to withdraw him. He was soon withdrawn, and shortly afterwards Colonel Davalou was recalled from this area. k. The rece it attitude and behaviour of th« Persian mi tor*v in Vi. Iran have given more and more grounds ror nisgtving: They are soft and intriguing with turbulent tribes li e t e Kalkhani, Jowanruai and Sinjabi, bui haxsh to pniet tribes or settled chieftains in quiet areas, especially if the latter are thought to be friendly to the British. ns tlreadv reoorted, ersian military ofiicers ma e it then business to spread anti-British feeling among the various tribes, and their latest policy is to tell them not to hand ov.r ^rain this year to their Government as ordered, oecause the British intend to confiscate it. Constant reports indicate that these military circlea(,with whom one may associate the gendarmerie ofiicers for Jome ■'uraosesjdonot wish for oeace and quiet among the tribes and sub-tribes, oecause it lessens their chances of intriguing with and taking bribes and gifts from contending sides, and doubtless a s because we frankly show that we want peace and quiet -in Kurdistan. 3 . one thing was clear from H. A. Coneul* a and the Political Adviser's visit to Kurdistan: among all the trice. tH-rv is indescribable bitterness against the Persian officials, ! particularly 6 the Military and police, and a fi™ ^termination, t whatever the cost, aeath or banishment, not to have back in the tribal areas under the same conditions as before^ vears of cruelty, extortion, impriaomnant leau^i . for no mown crime, defilement 01 their womenfold, ^^xon of their floc ks, their cultivation and their 9 , bv two years of virtual independence during «hxoh they have bflrt um^le oq )ortunity of seeing the cowardice and utter in- capacity 6 &gt; or^proper government of their former oppressor., are enough to account for all this. They ask for the sam. and possessions robbed from them any wee * dsYid are intriguing or preparing to ^ot ana rob the land, and^ jossessioiis of somebouy else. Either they wi tl exterminated from the map (the Turkish solution) .i aeal under British auspices ( the Iraqi solution). 10 alio-. the Persians/ u\— 2 — allort the Persians to .^o back there as before, or to help or sympathise with the )rese it Iranian Government in its shifty and highly suspect attitude and policy or rather lack of policy in this area is unthinkable and at variance v-ith all we and our allies stand lor in this war* 4. Shortly alter H.M. Consul*s return, fairly reliable stories became current that emissaries from Tehran were among the tribes visited urging a coal tion and persuading them to lay out a landing ground, obviously lor the use of German aircraft. The Political Adviser made another trip in July, ana found that the stories were well-founded, and that the emissaries had come from the notorious deputy Naubakht, who has done so much to bring about the present contusion and military debacle among the Kash^ai and Bakhtiari tribes in S. Persia, and is now presumably collaborating under our eyes with the enemy*s known new policy of disturbing the Kurds in Iraq and Iran. At the end of July an unidentified plane was seen by the British military authority flying low over the area slightly north of Kerrnanshah. 5. Further north in the Merivan area the intriguing Mahmuc Khan Karii Senani has been using a recalcitrant chieftain named Mhamud Dizli to ma e the roads towards the frontier impassable, and to threaten the Persian O.C. troops at Senendej that if his iorces are not withdrawn from the western part of Kurdistan that town will be attac ed. This is not likely to happen at present, but on the other hand the Iranian forces are not in any position to go out and check or punish such insolence. IRAMIAff ADMin'IbTRATIOfl.' 6. Five months have now gone by without a Governor-Ge^eraj in W. Iran, and more than that siuce the Kerman shah area saw a Persian officer higher in rank than a Colonel, except when the American General Ki^ley came in June on a quick two—day visit. The Ustandar-designate, Fahim ed bowleh, sticks month alter month in Tehran, ostensibly because the government will not *ive him an official car, but more probably because in the unstable political conditions now prevailing he hao no desire to exile himself to this thankless job ana remote district while a better post may be ^oing at any moment. Mr. Mohamed Gellahi, the narvous but comparatively resolute Acting Ustandar, tries at intervals to wriggle out of it, but is thrust bacK by M. ooheily with promised of a much better post if only he will hang on a little longer, until aater the elections. Meanwhile dis position is being made as untenable as possible by the Amir-i-Ku. and other landlords and speculators who resent his energy, and by corrupt leading officials such as the Chief oi Ge idarraerie who fear his independent spirit and courage. 7, After the unlamented departure of Mr* RukhI in May, things have gone from bad to worse in the dupply department. A new director named itiauba sh arrived, well- nown to the Kermanshahis for his having been impeached and imprisoned a few ears ago for embezzlement and dishonesty -vnen here m a similar position. This C onsyilate’s justifiable protest against being ex -ected to cooperate closely with such an individual at this important juncture and time of crisis in tne wheat-collecting problem seems to have led to his speedy removal and his replac ement by an American adviser, Mr. Berges. The general director of supply for the district, Hakimi, of whom so much wao ho &gt;ed, has turned out a disappointment as feared. He spends practically all his time either in Tehran or travellm, to and from Tehran, and occasionally dashes into Kermanshah for a day, seatteriiig impossible and contradictory orders right and left, and thoroughly upsetting the Supply department. The latter continue m their rogues* and sloths* progress, literallydoirit, nothing hatever except ta&gt;ve bribes aks upset supply arrangements as much as possible* Oiie senior official was found to have over 600 sugar coupons in his house; he was suspended from duty, but could not be dismissed without in structions from Tehran, which ox course will not arrive for many months, if ever. JJhile a bumper harvest is being cut and winnowed in this area, the supply ox government bread in the town gets worse and worse, and daily stocxs in the Supply departments stores smaller* and analler. There are 130 officiaii but the senior ones admit that Eh. a half ol them do no work at all, and nobody (exjept their relations) knowe why they were appointed at all. The answer to the recent half-hearted questions in the Majlis as to what has been done with the enormous sums voted to the Ministry of Supply is obvious to allin the provinces at any rate. FOOD SUPPLY. 8. From the above paragraph it will be judged that the pros.acts of collecting enough wheat to feed the towns during the coming winter and spring are again doubtful. The land lords are determined not to let the Government have its official quota ol wheat, whatever new regulations may be devised or published. They have decided on certain small amounts to be surrendered by them, but only after they have iinished selling xfe what they can on the black mar et, and hiding away what they think advisable for future use. The seecxal assessors and 'experts” have finished their task of ”estimating' the crops, but in exactly the manner foreseen. The C.L.O. attached to this Consulate found that in general about one-quarter of the proper yield had been written down, and in the villages of powerful and dangerous landlords li.e the Amir-i-Kull the investigators had deemed it better not to go at all. Such landlords have been heard to say that while the talk of income- tax is allowed to ^o on in Tehran, they cannot be expected to help the Government over wheat, but that if the hateful subject is dropped, they will see what they feel li^e aoing about their grain. bast season in the Supply centres the entries regarding deliveries ox peasants 1 wheat were fraudulently altered to show the grain as having come from important landlords as part of their undertakings; this year the reverse is li ely to happen, and landlords* wheat sold to Government fraudulently entered under small cultivators* names, so that details compromising to income-tax appraisals may be covered up as far os possible. 9. Although estimates of a kind have been made as above, iew or no landlords* signed undertakings have been obtained yet, and it is fairly certain that last year*s obstructionism and delay will be repeated, while the fe rain goes underground. There are stories current in the town th t Dr. Millspaugh is -8suing more drastic proposals whereby all wheat is Government property, cannot be m.;ved without a permit and can be seized wherever found after a certain date. The result of this has been a further fillip to the black max* et locally and an in centive to the growers to hold up and hiae ^rain, temporarily or permanently. All the townspeople with any money at all are falling over themselves to lay in what private stocics they can afford, while ^.rowers become more determined to hid© grain quickly as it is ^threshed and collected, in order to avoid any danger of seizure. The priof ox ail this is that black- raar/vet prices have risen in July from 4500 rials per ton to 7000 rials per ton (the official buying price being 3500 rials). While Government bread gets scarcer and worse in quality, uncontrolled bread which is extremely plentiful in the town has risen during-4- July irom 14 rialo to 24 rials &gt; r batman* The stssaiiJfL&amp;xX&amp;Ju&amp; officials and &gt;olice do not stop unauthorised wheat either from coming into the town, or Irora illicitly leaving the aistrict for less rich aua more i.'®rvous areas beyond Hamadan, often it is said on British-coutrolled U.h.C.G* lorries. iv;. Whatever regulations Dr* Uillapau^h may issue, it is ailiicuit to see how they can be applied by any oi the present w type of Iranian official, whether civil, police or military. U^:J •! wilat ws ® needed was a score or more Englishmen a couple of months ago to give some bac bone to the rclimiaaries o£ wheat—collection, Our inability to spare these from the large lorces in the Middle East for a few weece only may perhaps mean that we may have to spare several sorely—needed cargo ships for many mouths bringing American grain lor the Persian towns as before while the country— siae bulges with hidaen and sometimes rotting foodstuffs. Many Persian notables here are already sayi.^, whether with honest or di-shonest intentions, that whatever the present harvest may be ll&lt;ce, the 1944 harvest must be a failure. Besides the ground being tired after this year*a enormous crop, they say that there I will be no farm animals left among the peasants to till the ground this autumn for next simmer's crops. M&lt; n$r oxen died last winter owing to the artificial shortage of ana high irices for barley and fodder, or were slaughtered for food. Prices for the remaining animals rose to unheard-of levels, so that the improvident and short-sighted peasants a id smallhqu e rs were induced to sej.1 all their cattle, including draft animals. Thus only the already rich and powerful landlords owning scores of xUdba villages (some own a hundred or more) will now have beasts. Is Persia to become a country of latifundia, or will the social outbreaks following on social degradation (already intolerable enough even to the most casual foreign observer) which RoaBan or Russian history warns one are inevitable occur first? Allowing for changed and difficult world conditions, even a perfunctory glance at Plowden (1*385) or Rabin© (1906) will show how dis- quietingly this part of Iran has declined in fertility, agri cultural yield, revenue, size and number of villages and rural population. A quarter of an hour , s visit moreover to a place like bhahabad, where the moael buildings ana houses put up by the ex-Shah a dozen years ago are falling into desolate decay or have been violently pulled to pieces, and famished beggars swarm in one of the most fertile s dts in Iran, or even ten minute's walk through the main street of squalid and unlovely •\ Kemanshah emid its magnificent natural surroundings, will present anyone with a picture beside which Goldsmith's 'Deserted ^ Village' would seem like a prosperous American tourist-resort's illustrated brochure. oOVi./J ACTIVITIES. 11. The Soviet Consulate remains still in chai*ge of a Vice-Consul named Ceerov, who does not im iress one ..uch. He has been recently to Khurramabad and Pizful, but the excursions into Kurdistan appear to have ceased. The various clerks and secretaries otill prowl around the lesser purlieus of the town, but their connection with the Tudeh or any radical movement seems very slight. They obviously watch very closely however the manner in which the blind and greedy richer classes here are knc knocking away the social foundations and inevitably bringing nearer catastrophe for the country and themselves. There were rumours at the end of June that Soviet forces from -zerbaijan haa occupied Saqqiz but these were not afterwards substantiated. People from that district say that a lot of cattle aiid sheep have been leaving Kurdistan for the Russian-occupied' zone. GENERAL . 12/- 6 - 16. The present incumbent of this Consulate is leaving Kemanshah this month, and this ’iey be his last diary. When Feldmarschall von der Qolz was leaving Kerma. shah in 1916 and retiring on Bagdad he wrote in his last report: “Complete chaos in ersia; nothing whatever to be done; dust, cowardice and corruption. “ what such a personage, surrounded by experts like ochiinemnnn and Kiedermayer, wrote in wartime 1916, a mere depart ing Consul in 1943 need not try to improve upon. Thoughtful Persians now aurait that, although they may have been op&gt;osed to foreign influence in Iran all their lives, they see no hope whatever for their country at present except in i©reign inter vention — which of course means British or American, not Russian. Less thoughtful Iranians repeat weakly that if we wished to improve matters in Iran we could do so, the corollary of course being that we do not wish lor improvement. ^ ■ G. cook H.M. Consul.

The vacant post of Director of Supply in Kertaauahah w&amp;e offered in mid-Aug'ftfet to a knowledgeable local oificAal named MU’STE Z A A3PA, but he declined it owing to nervousness at his power to cope with the p ‘esent state of inefficiency, graft and confusion ^ in the Supply Department. The ofiicial mentioned in last month’s ^ report as having been suspended for being caught with uv«r GOG su^ar- coupons in his house, was this month appointed to a lucrative poet as head of the Supply Department at KAKGAVAR, but this move has been attributed to Mr BERGEN, the American assietant now in charge, or rather tc his alleged v.dllingneas to to sign any Persian doctAiije..t put before him. 6. The demonstrations at the beginning of August mentioned above were caused primarily by the shortage ana b&gt;tu quality of bread In the Government shops, and by the dearness of the 'free' bread which the bakers preferred to sell in large quantities* They ^ei*e ^ fanned however by agitators, some oi whom were suspected of being in the jay of the AMlk-i-&lt;CUnG ana his landowner friends. The local police dia nothing whatever for two aays^o check the readiness and throwing of stones, and there are reasons to believe tin t certain police officers, as well as some officers of the ieoul garrison, an- 3 couraged the riff-raff. The British were of course blamed for the oread shortage, until the Governor at the instance of this Jonsulate put up a notice threatening any such statements with imprisonment. on the second day, part of the mob threatened to attack ohops in the v Jewish quarter, which gave H.M.Oonsul an opportunity of warning the authorities ot the political dangers of complacency; and th ,n- strations were quickly endec., as they could have been at the start, similar scenes occurred a few aaya later at H madan ana halayir. 7.

The collection of grain continued during January, principally frota &gt;easant owners under the sugar barter scheme. About 1500 tons rrere received.

The bread situation in /.e man shall was satis factory on the whole. At the beginning of the month, quality showed a Marked deterioration for three or four days, due it was stated to tN= Wheat not being properly cleaned. This in turn was due to a wage- dispute with the cleaners. The difficulties were dealt with and no further complaints were heard. 27. The situation as regards sugar, tea and cloth was not oo satisfactory, especially in the tribal areas. Supplies of cloth in the districts are almost nil and the underclaG condition of tribesmen, women aid children is serious. The disaati si action lelt th this state oi affairs is aggravated by the conviction, usual amongst them, that townspeople receive preferential treatment. ad. /IQ 26* A meeting cuxivened by the (Jstandar to conaider questions relating to the Spring Sowings was held on the 17th.

It was late but not too late as it had been preceded by abnormally mild weather and the seed had not suffered from frost. Indeed the lateness of the snow had given time for more ploughing to be done. The auguries, therefore, for the next harvest are good. The essential thing now is that Spring * rains should fall at the right time and in sufficient quantities. KCGKOMXC I 30.

The exhibition will remain open to the public for about 10 daye or a fortnight. smuiffl vmpm^mA i 31. ’&lt; artier weather led to much larger audiences Inside •tad outside of our Radio Hall in the evsnings.

Public opinion, fortified by Russian successes, ia however still convinced of Allied victory.

Seven months at his post without respite was perhaps overlong for a major official to remain without personal contact with the central authorities - and seems uncommon nowadays! Towards the end of June he paid a brief visit to J AR3IN. 2. The ap ointment of MURTULA .VBUZAIR # Head of the M^inicipallty, to be Assistant to the Governor-General (ay Li ary, para to raph 2) has fallen through. FAtflM-ud— DOULEH declared to H.U.

The Ustandar has lost confidence ixi the young and somewhat inexperienced ABdZAIR and some time ago, it seems, discarded his earlier notion of nominating him as his de nuty. 3. A number of Heads of Government Departments in Kermanshah have twice during the month descended in a body on outlying districts on visits of inspection. At the beginning of dime Gendarmerie, Justice and Bank-1- Mi 111 chiefs want to ILAte in PliCHT-i-IIUH and a wee£ or so later a more numerously attended rural ride took place to KULIAI. In both areas the officiale i r ere petitioned by the villagers and tribespeople for cloth, su^ar and tea. 4. The Chief oi Gondaxraerie, Colonel YAI'I I, had an active month, for in addition to hie tour of inspection of PUSHTVi-KUP, which took him to DllHLURAii, he has been engaged in pursuing, with the results described in para graph lb below, brigands responsible for two serious hold-up• /- 2 - hold-upa on the main road between Kermanehah aiid Bi •~..IBALU At the end ol' the month he we© ex jectintf the arrival Xrom Tehran of eix motor-cycles (unfortunately *l d *???* r *) which he proposes to distribute between SMSm arid K^RLW.

Meanwhile a local aapirant to the succession, AkFA~u*-» 8 U£?AN ZAKuAS£H, who has been a possible candidate for many months past, has been canvassing for support.

A&amp;FA is therefore ^ out oi a job and a visit to Tehran of some vreecs duration in April ana May has not apparently inclined the central authorities favourably towards him bo iar. Adi A is a friendly official who has long aofainistrative experience in Finance Departments in many parts of Persia and a very intimate knowledge of this province, his local conneet- Xions may, however, have weighed againet him. 9. The Cereals and Bread Section was reinforced towards the end of the month by the arrival from Tehran of ALI AKBAk WAS Hi, nominally as Inspector or Grain Collection.

The Tehraii authorities still h &gt;d the matter under consideration at the end of the month. It is oi interest to record that the Sub-Governor of the GURAW informed H.M.

The Political Adviser visited Tehran towards the end of the month to discuss the question. British interests involved are principally security on our L. of 0. ana consiaerntions of prebtige. % 16. Security cannot be said to be good. On the night or the 4th«-6th about 1,000 yards of telephone wire was stolen near HISITUA ana a similar theft at the same place oocurrea on the night of the 28th—£9th. Arran,, ements to deal with these wire thefts have been made by the Politi cal Adviser, with the approval of the Uatanaar, under which bakhshdars and ka&amp;khudas are to be responsible for sections of the road. Three hold-ups of fi.K.C.C. truces, or trucks under contract to the J.K.O.C., were reported. Cn the ni t ,bt oi the 12th-15th one truck was held up near 8UHK&amp;8 DXZ&amp;H, above the PAITAC4 pass, mu the driver I'obbed of hie possessions. A C.M.P. p- trol arriving opportunely opexiea lire find next day a body was louna on the spot by the Gendarmerie, who are following the matter up. On the night of the 19tb-5dJth, five lorries were held up between MAHXBASET anu ShARABAD. An unaided B.O.R. ©rri\ing on the scene was also held up and together with the lorry-drivers was relieved of his possessions. Some of the gcods carriea by the trucks was looted. The Gendarmerie /- 6 - Gendarmerie later arrested eleven suspects, on the complicity ol‘ at least live oi whom Qolonel says th&lt;, eviaenoe is clear. The third incident tool place on the night of the 30th, when one truc&amp; was stopped between 3AR—i—r'UL—i—2iUHAB and £LRlft£ and the driver stripped. The hold-u j of two durushhis between Aemanshah and the Oil Refinery - i.e. 2 or 3 miles from the town - was reported towards the end of the mouth, when the passengers were robbed. 16.

Here, too, admonition has been necessary, for this young men has been spending too much of hi a time in Kem&amp;nshah and too little lat hio jp©fet.

The Governor-dieneral has also besnyeing into the question recently. It is hoped therefore that punishment may yat be meted out to some of them, which may serve as a warning to would-be defaulters next year. 35. The •iree 1 market price of grain in Kerruanshah is slightly higher than last month at 170-180 tomans a kharwar aiid still more ol the oheao, but adulterated, Government bread is having to b*~ oa&lt;ea to leea the towii. Between B3 ana &lt;44 tons of Government flour are now issuea to the bakers every clay, which aporoaches the maxii*mra of about 3Q tons reached during the xast winter. The uuxlere, with an excellent excuse in an increasingly meagre water •upply, are being as unhelpful as they can ana are milxing not more than io or 17 tons of grain a auy.

The elections for the Kerianshah Municipal Council wero held on the 2nd and, in contrast to the earlier attempt (February Diary, paragraph 15j, passed off without Incident.

The period under review covers roughly the months spent by the tribes in their summer pastures in the uplands ol Western Persia. In an area so essentially tribal, the movements or its nomads, their inter-tribil relations and internal government are oi' major concern to the Persian administration and or direct interest to Persia’s allies. No threat of importance to the security of the L. of C» passing through this area to the north developed during the periou and security has been generally satisfactory in tribal districts abutting on the main highway. Migration from the winter quarters situated below the plateau, virtually completed by the bc^innin^ of May, passed off without serious incident and the tribes settled down to the summer pursuit oi grazing their flocks on the mountair^astures impoverished this year by scanty rainfall in the spring. In February and March, similar conditions of drought prevailing in the frontier districts of ’Iraq had driven certain elements of the BLNI LAM to cross into the neighbouring areas or PUSHT- i-KUH at Mkh IAK and BEHLUEAN in search of grazing. This visitation, made under a Grazing Agreement conduced some months earlier between the Persian auu ’Iraqi Govern ments, passed off without untoward incident, although the presence of some 4,000 tribesmen from outside, reported to be armed, aroused at the time the misgivings of the Governor-General. By the beginning ox the period under review the BENI LAM had for the most part returned to their own side of the frontier. 3. The Persian tribes, having reacneu their summer quarters, ware not long xn shoeing signs Ox unrulinase. The WALADBEGI ware aecuseu or indulging in sheep-rustling at the expense of their 8INJABI neighbours; within the- Sinjabi tribe itself there was dissatisfaction with the / Sir Peacex- ««. ijuilard, . c.B«, n. o.

Lats^r the JAv ^RU^I , s * S v JW - 1 ^ f ppr ': hen6ion ° r tht attitude towards 01 the Avk‘ “.lAh-i-oAHlh. who had scores from the Sfwlhw? tpii L ' J httl 1 ? 1 &amp;aa withitt the WALAUBBSI and OAUAJAUX tx'ioes there was recurrent friction between s^-bat ineffectiye bakhshuars and agbreeeive ana ambitious relatives arm rivals, dot in the latter tribes alone out m the oiijabi ana Kalhur it was perhaps as uincn t, c wwa ness of the bairhshaars ana their lack of control over the more disoraerly elements as their vtnalitv and oppression that provoked discontent. For bb Ion - ^ established custom these tribal sub-governors, ajpointed -rom the ranks oi the ehieftainly families by the fannan- uar oi the district with the approval oi the ustandar of the province, are permitted to call upon their tribes- poople xor contributions in icind towaras the maintenance oi their position and it is probably true to say that, x imi.i.y xeuds apart, only when these levies become extortionate and are accompanied by inability to maintain order and iteep the peace, are the rank and file of the governed moved to complain of their rulers to central~ authority* 4. oomplaints are not addressed solely to the Persian authorities but indeed are often received in the first paace oy H.ivn Consul and the Political Adviser* The practice, which probably began with the occupation of tnis part oi Persia by gritish troops in Septenoer, 1941, is almost invariable and, with the useful aid and chec* to other sources of information thus afforded, it is possible to stimulate and direct the Persian authorities in matters which concern the security of the communica tions oi the province ana of British iormations stationed along the main road. During the past six months co-opera tion between the nritish ana Persian authorities has been close ana friendly, the Ustandar, MUSTAPHA QULI KEMAL HKDAjTAT, F AH1M—ud—DOULBH, as well as the heaas of the Persian Army and Gendarmerie proving receptive and, v.iouiii limits imposed oy the delects oi the Persian auiainistrative /- 3 - administrative machine, helpful. Not only in routine investigation or hold-ups or motor-transport and of the frequent thefts oi British military telephone *ire, but over a wiaer 1‘it'la in the settlement oi tribal ana inter tribal unrest, this co-operation has been fruitful. In ^ the instances quoted in the previous paragraph special •visits by the .Political Adviser to the areas and tribes affected, in company with the military and gendarmerie oilleers concerned, resulted in the settlement of potentially awieward threats to the local peace which, it is believeo, would have been difficult j.or the Persian officers to reach unaided. Of the holu-ups, some seven of importance v. ere reported, the majority occurring on the stretch o^ ro^i irrmieuiately north anu south oi SHAHABAD, v.e.rle a similar uoinber oi tacits oi telephone wire oh ore a a remarkable entree ox concentration in the BXSITUf area. An improvement regards thefts was aiscerniole in the latter part Ox the buinmer, uue prcoably to security arrangements introduced by the Political Adviser whereby village headmen were made responsible. b. At this point X venture to submit that, for the maintenance Ox security on the L. ui o. , it will still for a time bo necessary to interest ouroelves actively in the tribal areas through which it runs, for security is indivisible ana disorder in outlying districts aid encampments must react unfavourably on tho safety oi the roatu That Persian authority must be able to assert itself anu maintain ^eace ana order in all areas is obviously aesiraoie ana will become the more essential the nearer the ante o1 the eventual withdrawal oi ^ritish troops approaches. Ihio re-establishment ui Persian authority among the trioes, shattered by the Occupation of September 194tl, must be assisted ana# during the past twelve months^ the efforts oi this Consulate have been I directed to that end. 6. The prospects, it must be admitted, are not at present encouraging for in addition to a aeep distrust of tuo tribesman for the official and officer* a feeling which amounts almost to hatred ox the latter, there are serious deficiencies ox organisation, transport, personnel and finance to be made good before the Administration can be halo to have even a fair chance of success. There may perhaps /- 4 - perhaps he little hope save in a new enpro^ch to the tribal problem whereby, under the direction of carefully selected ci'V'il ofiicials, a programme or social ameliora tion, particularly in respect of health services, educa tion and agriculture, would be undertaken. Military oxficera, ^ith same bat revs? exceptions, appear to be unfitted for these aaninistr;: tive tasks - their legitimate rdle in an;, ca^e is different ana should, wherever possible, be suborcinate to civil authority. A commendable effort to conciliate the trices, however, was made by the 0.0. Kennanahah Bri^aae in August when a conference or tribal leaders was hela at cermanahah. In a apeech Colonel CdAH- RUKHSHAHI admitted oast errors and promised attention to tribal needs in the future either locally or, if accessary, at Tehran where a Tribal Commission had recently been formed b; Government. The coniereuce was v/elcorned by those vho attended cut unfortunately, although xlirthcr .iissoiigs at monthly intervals were promised, there has so far been no repetition or this encouraging innovation. 7. The ?rcsenes of British troops in the province is still the principal stabilising factor. The prospect of their eventual withdrawal is viewed by many, in particular by the Christian minorities of ermanshah, with foreboding and gloomy prognostications of vfo.at may then be expected are not infrequently expressed by Christian and Moslem alike. The tribes for the most part are well-armed and the ability oi the Persian military and (lendaimerie to maintain lav/ and order, inspite of successes shortly to be described, is open to grave doubt. The disarmament of two snail, but troublesome, sections of the KAIHUR, the SI AH SI AH and XARGAH, was attempted m August with partial success, thirty-one rifles being- collected, but no measure of general disarmament has as yet been contemplated# 8. In 194d it was sometimes found advisable, in the interests of security, to remove hostile or turbulent tribal leaders, regarcieu as a menace ato the peace ox the province, from their* tribes or disf lets to kemansha.,, or* to ether aaatras suiiicicntly distant for t .. .. to be out oi harm* s way. This was done at the instance oi the British by the Persian civil or military authorities by v/hom those so detained were kept under surveillance# At a time when, with the presence of German armies m the Caucasus unu north Axrica, the chi'eat ol war to xeisian soil /soil was real; whsn pro-Axis sympathy was live; andvhen Persian oil’lcials and officers, when not obstructive, were inert, it was essential for prompt and vigorous measures to be demanded by our representatives. The comparative Quiet of the tribes oi western Persia during /'*' the past two years may be attributed in large part to this manifestation of the presence of British military power in their midst. But with the removal of the immediate threat of war, a less downright policy became possible ana. the gradual release of those unaer detention coulo be allowed. This policy was begun tome months before the opening ox the period under report ana has been followed steadily during the past six months. ISach case has been considered individually and in recognition of te ood behaviour and subject to guarantees a number of detenus have been allowed to return to their tribes or estates. In February a Binjabi held in Hamadan; In Kureh one ol five detenus in Kerrnanshah from Pusht-i-iiuh; in June two troublesome landowners from KULIAI, also detained in Kerman shah; in July the lour remaining tribal chieis from Pusht-i-Kuh; in August aid October two other Sinjabis in Hamadan were all released by the Persian authorities alter consultation with the local British representatives concerned, whilst at the end of the period under review the cases of two Sin jab i and four Guran chieftains, detained in -ehran, were under active consideration. 9. The process of measured release of detenus was* punctuated, and lor a time sot back, by the evasion of surveillance of tv/c chieftains of the KALKKAHI BAPHAMI section of the GURAIj tribe, QADIR BAHSAMI RASHID-us- SULTANi-H and his brother KaSHID AGflA BAHRAMI. These two men, who in 1943 hud boon suspected of' association with the Fifth-Columnist ex-deputy ftAtJBAKHT arid had, together with some oi those referred to in the previous paragraph, been exiled to Har.adan, returned without permission during May to their estates in the BALAHU massif north of KERIND. Efforts during the ensuing weeks by the Gstandar and * Persian civil and military officers, supported by the British authorities, failed to induce the runaway brothers, safe for the moment in their mountain retreat, to cane ixi to Kennaashah and. military operations to round them up were sanctioned by Tehran. These be b an on August 20th, with considerable tribal support from the Sinoabi, Guran and Kalhur. All tribes were warned against /against harbouring the Rashids and the frontier authorities in ’Iraq were asked to refuse the runaways entry into that country. After a chase of several weeks, during which time they were reported to have attempted unsuccessfully to cross into ’Iraq, they entered Jav/an- ruai territory on September 9th, with a small following of about thirty. Refused asylum and aovised to surrender by the Jawanrudis, who v/ere actuated by deference to British representations rather than to Persian authority, they became involved in a running skirmish with this tribe, during which Rashid-us-Sultaneh was mortally wounded. Two others were killed and later Rashid Agha and a number of followers, who had taken refuge with the neighbouring Babajani, v/ere captured. The satisfaction of the Persian Government over the prompt liquidation of this ai'lair, which appears to have had a salutary effect generally among the tribes, was marked by the presentation of medals end other awarus to a number of Jawanruui tribesmen, while Rashid Agha and his men were sentenced by a military Court to two years’ imprisonment. Kurdistan. 10. Farther to the north the peace of the frontier districts ol Persian urdistan was broken by tv/o incidents of more than minor significance. The first involved one of several sections of the JAP tribe from ’Iraq who had crossed into Persia to graze their flocks. This section, the ROGHZADl’s, according to the ofiicial account, neglected to pay grazing dues anc resisted attempts at collection. The Roghzauis assert, on the other hand that they were prepared to pay ana sent representatives to the O.C. troops at Sakkiz to arrange payment when these, fiiteen in all, were incontinently arrested. Their camps were then raided, they allege, by Persian troops and tribal han e ers-on, and each side suffered one fatal casualty in the skirmish that followed. Certain it is that the men were arrested and that a sKirmish took place, but whichever version may otherwise be nearer the truth, it seems clear that the affair was discreditable to the Persian military and the Ro^hzacis, now in a Ssnnandaj prison where two of their number are said to have died under harsh treatment, should be given their freedom. „ „ , 11 . /7 - 11* A more serious situation developed in September with the seizure of MERIVAiv by HAMA RASHID of BANEH and ALI KHAii VHLILH2.IRI, one of the ke rival a chiefs, who with assistance from MAHi«UD KliAi 1 * Dlajil ejected MAHJ^IUD KHAN KAiiY SEHAi'iY from the town, fhe latter* thereupon appealed to the Persian Array for help. This was promptly given arid Merivan occupieu on September slst by a force which incluaed taiuco, annoureu cars ana artillery, ii^iicouraged by this success anu the slight resistance encountered, the 0.0. 4 ^v, Division, nrigaaier Hu.iHiViaiHD AP3HAR, reinforced by BOO troops from Tehran and with the support of contingents of loyal tribes, marched on BANEH and occuoiea it, again meeting with negligible resistance, on October 1st, the town having been fired b;y Hama Rashid who aicceeaed in withdrawing to the hills. Here on the f lraq frontier he took to harassing the Persian forces with guerilla attacks on military posts and transport columns, now faced with increasingly rigorous weather conditions in rough country and with aggravated transport and supply difficulties. At the end of the period under review the assistance of the ’Iraqi authorities on the frontier was being sought in order to aeny him refuse beyond the border. 1&amp;. The Persian Government, in undertaking these operations, were believed to be far from averse from taking up the challenge flung down by Hama kashid, for since the rebellion under his leadership in the spring of 194# ana subsequent settlement whereby he received a monthly subsidy and virtual local autonomy, their juris diction in the Baneh area had been purely nominal. Their aim now appears to be to restore their authority and to reduce the dangers of a movement towards Kurdish autonomy, which they fear may be stimulated by the example of Hama Rashid, a popular figure with much once over neighbouring 'lurdish chiefs, notable lAZI MUFARlwii) at HAH Ad AO, with whom be was said to^have close relations. The commendable desire of the Persian Government to introduce a civil administration in the disturbed area, upon the re-establishment of their authority, was demonstrated by the despatch of a Cabinet Minister, n. KHALIL RAHIMI, during October to Kuraistan to investigate the possibilities oi an acceptable settle ment. bnbued, as was also the then Prime Minister, M. tiA'DD, with reasonable views on the Kurdish question and /and taking with him relief supplies for the sufferers in Baneh, he had grounds for hoping that his mission would find a general welcome* The effect of his visit is not yet apparent anu ho left for Tehran early in November, having apent most ox his time in Bennandaj-. The military diliicultiea in the situation remain unresolved anu on the opot the civil authority, in the person of the o-uv^rnor of Kuruistan, QHAHAiP-ud—3X)ULBK, a charming but eluorly dajar shahzaaeh, is overshadowed by and acquiescent to the Military Commander* Huehmand Afshar is reported to be a capable soiaier but some thing more than that is required, and his lac^ of sympathy towards the Kurds, ueliberately displayed ever since he took up hie command in February last, has alien ated even the most moderate clemente in Kurdistan. Pusht-i-Kuh. is* There is little to record ox the tfovemorate of Pus ht-i-duh* In July the Government of f Iraq expressed concern that the waters of the C/AdGIR Rxver, which flow from Persia into 'Iraq at MAUDALI, were being diverted for irrigation purposes inside Persia. Under provisions of the 1^14 Frontier Commission's proceedings Mandali should receive half tlxse river waters. It may be doubted whether in this year oi exceptional drought there was any considerable flow in July and August but the Gangir was reportsu to oa running through to Manaali again in September* In oAIMARRMH, the southemaost district, there has been trouble doriiig the summer months between the factions of rural Mirs. The Military Governor of Pusht-i-duh, Colonel UUKRY, was anxious to secure the transfer of this uistrict, the inhabitants or which are Lurs, not Kurds as the rest of Pusht-i-Kuh, to Luristan but this was not approved. Otherwise this Governorate, which for three years has prospered under the paternal rule of Colonel Mukry, presents a happy contrast to the restlessness of other parts of the Ustan. Local Governacnt. 14* The 5th Ustan has been fortunate during the past twelve months in its Governor-General. Fahim-ud-Louleh brought considerable diplomatic and aoministrative expox’ience to this post and, until a few weecs before his /hie departure in October, conducted the affair* of the U? tan on the whole with so.ccees* He had the talent of mana^in^, hia head a oi dovemifient ae par tne nta. running them ao a haruonioub tea*,,. Uiiable himaelf to travel hio province ao he would have liKea, partly owing to x'- the lack of a deputy to ta e charge in his absence (for the Fa xaandari oi Ke man shah a&amp; a separate oifice was abolished before his arrival) ano partly perhaps to ar,© and latterly to increasing infirmity, he nevertheless encouraged his officials to take e\ery opportunity to visit the districts. He was taken seriously ill early in August and was removed to Tehran in October, since when his former chef de cabinet, JTkKAk^HAHI, has been in charge. The Gove mo rate 8 01 SHAdkBAD and Hamadan have been without titular officers in residence for somewhat prolonged periods, the former through the removal o.-. an u.isatisf ictory Governor a*id toe latter through tne absence in Tehran since the middle of nuguat 01 GAiGiAH AuClAi/h The eliiciene^ Ox aoministration can hardly fail to be adversely affected. 15. A change in the Fifth Ust an as an adndni at rat i ve unit v/as announced in March when, with the appointment of Shahab-ua-Douleh 8s Governor of kurdistan, that area I oedareu tol M iXLd8ptll4Mt &lt;l attd its Governor to be responsible direct to Tehran. This was an unwelcome decision to the Ustancar, to whom it cane as a surprise, and was taken up by him with the Government when he visited Tehran in April-ilay. On hi* return he stated that he ha*- been assured that the transfer of Kurdistan from his Ustan ./ould not, in fact, be proceeded with, but subsequent events ana the apparent lack oi interest in Kermanshah in the situation in Luraistan do not seem to bear this out. 16. The military administrative organisation consists of the 4th (Kurdistan) I/i vision and the 12th (Ke man shah) Brigade, the latter being within the Command of the O.C. 5th (Luristan) Division at Xhurramabad, ail arrange ment which occasionally gives rise to confusion in dealings with the tribes. Fahim-ud-Douleh suggested to Tehran that the Kermanshah Brigade bo made independent but the policy ox the Ministry of War is understandably opposea to the creation ol small independent commands. Colonel Shahrukhdx ahi, O.C. the Brigade, has been co-operative /10 - co—operatire and friendly to British interests since he toor over this command in August, 1943, anu is partly due to his influence that relation* between British officials and Persian ofiicers are now more *3' cisiactory tnan belore. His past record does not inspire great confidence in him as a soldier out in justice it must be recorded that much oi the orsuit iior th~ success of the operations against the jdashiu.s is his. 17. Venality - ”ie malheur de notre pays” ao xuhim-ud- nouleh would sometimes exclaim — is here, as elsewhere, the lubricant without which it seems the machine coulu hardly wore. ft is true of every dgpart..ient, where all are underpaid ana where the supplementation of ^lariws by illicit means is time-honoured. Of the departnt nts themselves, the Qendairoerie is seriously uiideiTiiaAaiwu, its officers frequently changed ana its trans jort and other equipment inadequate; Justice is labyrinthine, ailatory and often where British interests are involved inclined to os unauly lenient; Education and Health, outside of the larger centres of population, have the merest skeleton organisation. In i-Cerman^hah a G-ovom- ment hospital of 30-35 beds serves a population of ab,G0G ..ouls, and line Shahaoad and Ham where hospitals exist, has had until recently very meagre supplies of drugs. The Finance Department, which since day has had an American Director-General, has come less to unfavour— aoln notice but its subordinate Bread and Cereals Depart ment, especially under it* former designation of dhafbar, came uader heavy fire for corrupt practices, bein^ redeemed only by the excellent work done By British oj-xicials in the vital work of grain collection. The distribution ox rationed cloth, tea and su^ar haw been satisfactory in iCemanshah, but until August la^gtd behind in rural districts. Some progress was later reports&lt;/in the distribution of these goods to the tribes and peasantry through centres established at grain- colie ctio^poixita. The lie man shah Municipality has suffered a considerable reduction in its budget by the aoolition ox the 3^ octroi at the beginning of the Persian year 1323 (March 21st). The Police also suffers from an insufficient bucket but, although short of men, has managed to maintain a good standard of security in the town. ., .18* The local press is of little significance arid during the past six months has consisted of three papers appearing thrice weekly ana a fourth appearing once a week, all oi small circulation. The weekly- paper ceased publication in Octooer upon the removal ..ox its eaitor to Tabriz, where it may reappear. Tehran newspapers have/ consider able public ana exercise v/hat influence the press may be saia to have. lj m Political parties fortunately have played no rOle in this district in recent months and even in the general elections of a year ago were very little in evidence. The 'kDALAT 1 ' party, numerically the strongest with a membership of about 400 inducing some secessionists from the TlfDEH, meets regularly but is reported to devote its deliberations to questions of a moral rather than a political nature. The Tuueh party, w^ose demise was prematurely announced some months ego, and the MIHAb menage to exist with some two score menbers each. The PAIKAR, which came into existence in May, has not survived the summer. 20. There is no labour movement, organised as nch, in this area. The chief single employer is the Keraanshah Petroleum Company, whilst at snuhabad the sugar factory gives employment to up to oOQ, peasants from nesrby villages for the most part, in the short period it s in active production. There has been some difficulty during the summer with discontented subordinate members of the factory maintenance staff which culminated in b'uly in an affray with the management. I-conomic situation. 121. From an economic point ox view trie local situation was a good deal easier this summer than it has been at any time since the events of 1941. The period under \ review saw the completion ox yrovernment purchases irom the 1943 grain harvest - one of the biggest in living memory - and the gathering in ox what lor the province as a whole must be consiacred a fairly satisfactory new harvest, with the towns assured of &amp;he supply of their staple foodstuff - oreaa, signs ox ai improvement in the distribution of Crovemifient stocks ox sugar, tea and ;iece-goods ana expectations ox a speedy end to the /the war in Europe and an eventual resumption of peace time imports, prices in the bazaar showed for the first time since the inflation a certain suability and in a number of cases were even appreciably reduced. At the same time labour maintained its earning power, the daily rate for an unskilled workman in Kemanshah being 35’ rials (over 5 shillings) throughout the period. 22. drain collections from the 1943 harvest for the ^h 0 le orovince excluding Ramadan and Kurdistan reached the high total of over 34,000 tons, of which altogether 21,5Q0°ton8 had been sent to Tehran — including over 11 000 tons by British military transport - when despatches finally ceased in June* The new harvest was exceedingly ooor in several normally fertile districts cuct west of Kermanshah, owing to spells of unusually hot auc* dry weather in the late spring, but elsewhere was good, ihe total yield bein 0 probably considerably less than last th^ surplus available for Tehran is not expected U V*7J.

The temporary rise in the price or grain in xay, gune aixd July han no effect on thw price othto* commodities ana general commercial activity throughout the period was on a very small scale. ..holesale ^rices, which were tending to sae, even before the opening of the ”Secona” Front, in many cases fell considernoly artor the victories in France, the tendency being encouraged by the eventual dr*op in grain prices from August onwards and the increased local distribution 01 sugar, tea anc cotton piece-gocae. Ir&amp;ds in cotto^ piece-goods came to a standstill, tea was bo or oo /U cheaper, while the most remarkable change was in the price Oj. sugar, which fell by nearly 50^. Retail prices -ere less ready to fall in with the general trend held out a month or so longer but in September ana early October various retail prices, especially Tor fooustuffs, followed suit. The retail price of sugar fell by 40; , tea by 15?&gt; and rice by 30$, by comparison with tile . rices in Kay. For the first ru p^ in a lont day shops mi^ht he seen with their lie-tw oh in the daytime - the customary sign by which the puo^ic are /are informed that prices have been reduced. At the 'beginning of October rumours - apparently quite unfounded - that .Russian retail shops were to be opened in iieruianbhab caused no amall stir among merchants, a iew ol whom began auctioning long held stocks as fast as they could, by the end of the month they had recovered their composure, fortified by the thought that the war in Europe might not now be over till the spring, anc also encouraged a little by the lateness of the autumn rains which tended to raise the price of the 8tap#le commodity - grain. The period closed, however, with the retail prices of rt free” bread, sugar, tea, rice, roghan, cotton piece-goods, matches, soap said a iew other commodities, lower than they were at the beginning of the period by eraounts varying from 5 - &lt;36 . Nominal prices on the wholesale market finished a little higher than the lowest level reached during September ana early October but business was stagnant, retail shopkeepers being shy of buying even readily saleable goods. A realisation on the part of merchants and others who have speculated so successfully during the past two years that they could no longer hope to add very much to their gross profits caused many ox these newly rich to start converting their ill-gotten money into property, and buildings sprang up on several vacant lots in the town during the spring and sumioer. A few of them, on the other hanu, just missed laying up their treasure on earth, ior a number of minor banKruoteies were reported in their rants. Russian activities. 24. The Consulate of the U.3.3.R. in Ke man shah has displayed much activity during the past six months in the political anc propaganda sphere. With no iaek oi transport U. Nikolai KLIMOV, the Consul, ana, more frequently, his Vice-Consuls have visited Kurdistan on* several occasions, H«raadan where there is no Soviet representation, ano most of the more important centres in the Ustan. They are believed to take a constant, M&amp;fc though discreet, interest in local tribal axmirs, but their main preoccupation clearly is with Kurdistan where recent developments at Morivan ana Baneh excited oheir lively interest. Occasional visits to districts north of Sennen daj by anall parties of Rea Army oiiicers and men /men from the Russian zone, in seme instances ostensibly to buy horses and fodder but otherwise unexplained, hare been reported 1 ram time to time uy the A.jj«Q« there. The attention with which the Russian a have followed the events immediately to the ^outh ox their zone may be due to a concern lost the trouble at Baneh should spread to iiAKAdAb, where w^nzi i,iuiia»umau, as has been noticed earlier in this spatoh, is bolievea to be in close contact with Hama Rashid. 25. Our Soviet celloa^ues are assiduous, ii unoriginal* propagandists. Their lon^ suit has been an exhibition of photog t posters, etc. o^ Stnlingmd. and Leningrad* first shown in Kerman ah ah in March* where it failed to arouse any marked enthusiasm* and subsequently Uiiti l O ctober indefetigaoly displayed froiu Qasr- , i—Shirin to Hama dan and from S ennanda j to Ham with M. I'anicratov* the jimior Vice-Consul, and his introductory speech in attendance. A second exhibition on the Industries of the Urals has recently taken up the running, but the reception of this, too, by Persians weary of war subjects has bean lukewarm. Films supplied to the local cixienias* a public display-board; and a small reading room* opened in midsummer in &amp; side street, complete the propaganda armoury of the Soviet Consulate. In their re LatIons with local Persian officials and notables their contact* are fairly wide but relations are more correct than intimate as the fear ol the nurthem neighbour is too general and too ingrained to allow, with a f« &gt; exceptions, of real friendliness. Only too often can this fear be perceived in the apprehensive speculations on what the end of the German war will bring, in Persia and Rurope. Celebrations of Soviet national ainiverearies are however well-attended. 26. For these political and propaganda duties the Consulate would appeal’ to oe aoequately etaxiec.., in numbers at least, for in addition to M. Klimov and two Vice-Consuls there are six subordinates of various kinds. M. Rlie OGKciuV, the Persian-speaking senior Vice-Consul* left on transfer to fleshed in June and his place was not taken until September when K. AVAKOV arrived from his previous post at Gurgan. During the in^ervxal, II, Klimov, who has no Persian and !.-!• Pankratov, w.io has16 - Z 1 little, haa recourse to their Persian-speaking juniors. With this lac,c ot language unci *ith no Persian employad i) the Consulate, it may he expected that the intelligence woi’k or the Consul ate must occasionally sutler. M. nlimov speaaccurate ii halting English anu M. Pankratov his Ovvn brand of French* Relations between the dritiah and Soviet Consulate* have been uniformly most friendly. British interests. 27. British interests, anu the activities of British officials and officers to protect and promote than, have been Largely dealt with in earlier paragraphs of this despatch. Among the more important are the maintenance of security on the L. or C. and in the areas in which British military forces are stationed; support of and co-operation with the local Persian administration in the establishment of its authority; assistance in such matters as to rain collection; and the cultivation of harmonious relations with all classes of the comimmity. In the field or Public Relations the progress of the .Var and British and Allied wer aims and effort have been given as wide publicity as possible through reading-rooms at Kermanshah and Hamadan, the radio listening-hall in Kei^nanshah, local broadcasts at Ramadan and over a wider area by a battery radio set taken on tour, while a touring cinema van has brought the film to lar^e audiences in remote districts as well as to townspeople and to the schoolchildren of Kermanshah. The distribution of supplies oi cloth, tea, sugar and medicines on behalf of the A. I.R.F. has played a useful part and the work done by the Fund's clinic at Sennandaj, under the direction of two Persian doctors who give their services free, has been notably successful. The British military have helped materially in these important humanitarian and propaganda fields, having during recent months comoleted the asphalting or the main street of nerniM/i ^nah, come to the rescue ol the poorer section oi the town by supplying drinking water by army tankers during the exceptionally dry summer months; and given hospital treatment to the Governor—general in a critical illness Which otherwise might well have proved fetal. i 8 not surprising that relations between the British military and the townspeople oi Kermanshah are on a friandly footing. The Consulate has found a disposition on the part /- 17 - Dart of all classes to cultivate closer relations, K ^ often it is realised 1 © 3 &amp; ^rom a liicing ior the British themselves thsu:i from tbe conviction, now generally if belatedly held, that the -^ar will end in an A^uxeu victory.

Forutan 1 ® subsequent activities appear to have been confined to making a speech «t • eraa^i mao ting in his own houae cm the felat and another on the following day when with other Tudeh Party followers he accompanied s^omc of the local jpaulatshahi family, two or three of whom are connected with the Tudeh, to a mourning at the grave of a lately deceased menfeer of that family. in tooth of theae speeches Forutan aeem»* to huve apohen tooastlngly of the si»e of his following in the to?m tout in fact genaenshah is still poor soil for th* seeda of labour unrest.

If, on the other hand, Forutun were to t unsfsr his activities to F^iadati, ^3ere several thousand men formerly employed by the American ASmy or the U.d.C.G. are new out of iotos, he might perhaps have more to show for hie tolling. 9. The authorities forbade all proceeaiono and aeieonstra- tlons during Muharram. Process ions are said to shave formed up in some of the mosques tout were not allowed toy the police to emerge into the streets. According to one account, local adherents of the political t '♦jidalat* /^ w gdLalat w an? at one with Xooal fimllaha in woriting for a revival of religion# feeling, a tactic which they purmie out of opposition to the Tudeh i%rty, whoee ten&amp;melee are anti-religious.

The Governor of Sennanda^ has been petitluiuio by the local Assistant piroctor of Customs to allow a branch of the Mel at Party to be opened there.

The Tribal Conference in August last (August Diary, paragraph 14) not followed by any further conte rerice a Mof the kind In Remaaahah but on December Ibth Golouel Shahrukhshahi held a meeting at ur-1 -x^l-i-;.ohab of leading ^arabero of various tribe a now in the Oamsir, at which e nuKber of questione of tribal interest - supplies, land rente, security of roada, ate. - were aiauusssd. &amp;ven if little comes of such meetings, it probably has a good effect on the tribe me a to find themselves treated by the authorities a® something more than potential brigands, though deeds must follow words if any permanent Improvement in relations arith the tribe® is to result. One potential source ftl friction between tribeo and aovemaent has ^ust arisen in the form oi a elate which the local finance authorities are thinking of presenting for the rent of certain state-owned grossing grounds along th# Iraq frontier north of ;aor-i-r&gt;hirin. sections oi the galfehanl Asperi (dursn), Subalanl nad ^ubadi (both &lt;faf) who use tfeeae lands in the wintwr months have apparently not paid any rent for the last two years# 1&amp;* There w$re no breaches of security during the swath* It appears that a hold-up took place at ^ar-i-^il between Virtue and ^sl Taq on November ooth, when i Oil Company vehicle and 8 g.B.l. lorries were stopped and the drivers robbed, and on December 9th ft British military vehicles were held up on the Semanshah side of dialtun ana /6 and a bonnet-oomr atolen from one of thara, possibly by labourera from the new British Arny etmpa, night Sinjsbi tribesmen are reported to have been arrested by the Oendarmerie in connexion with the first of these two bold* dps. It i© oerhaps ae well, however, that there have been no , «ore serious incidents, for the uendnmerie have not dieting!ahed themselves at ail in the work of rounding up ^tfce men responsible for the amea hold-up of k oil Company orries on t*w hafV-l-^hsh row a, reported in paragraph lb oi last month's lilary. it tee fallen to the brigade { onmander, Colonel $ hahrukhshahi, anu our own olitioal Aoviaer, to investigate thie hoiu-up and eventually to eecure the re-arrest of two out of tfc rea of the bandits (they turned out to be Csltaupe) who had been apprehended snrt then released after three deye in custody, as a result of collusion between the baJchehdar of uilan, aaeir. ft ban A'saami, end local ^enaamerle officers mm men, eemeuted by s wide distribution of bribes* nlttle interest was taken in the c^se either by the senior Oondamerie officer in the immediate area - Ctrpieln Attebegi at * aar-i-;&gt;iurin - or even, sc it mme, oy Colonel lHaulavi, the oifioer Consnanding the Regiment and Acting Officer Commantung Gendarmerie, who, Although he has been reauy to accept information supplied to him and has agreed to remove ^ome of the culprits, tes not vouchsafed any Inlomution of hie own investigations Into this discreditable buelness, if indeed he msde any serious attempt to investigate it* The affair underlines the desirability either of Colonel fumini* s turning to Kermanahah soon - it is now nearly six months since he was called to Tehran - or of hie being replaced by an officer of equal energy ana goodwill* It also well illustrates the kind of quaei-administrative duties which the British Political Adviser is callea upon, willynilly, to perform in the interests of gunsrai security; if his post wore to be abolished before British troops leave this area, however desirable such a step might aeem from tha point of view of removing all appearances of political tutelage, much might remain undone that ought in British interests to be dons, since whatever representa tion* were made on security matters and promises received.

Sews from ;urdiatan is slight. Bardrjaht (Kovwnbsr Diary, paragraph 9) was ocoupied on November anth. Aceording to one report it seems that the end of local autonomy following on the entry of ^erstian troops was not as unwelcome to the inhabitants of nariftsht as it was to those of Banwh v the reason being, apparently, that before the aisintogratlon of Ptraien authority in 1941 fSurdasht car^c under the civil adrainlatration of Aacrbaijsm not, liki Baneh, under the military administration of eniuin. aj.

W&gt;MXHAL , VZ~&gt;C~»0 — 1. There were lew events ol importance in this area during January. ^ &gt;In the continued absence of a Goveroor-General - Fahim-ud-Douleh is still on aick leave in Tehran - officialdom slept its winter sleep undisturbed and only the very energetic or those with a candidate of their own to back might be heard voicing some such mild protest as: 'dea affaires ne marchent pas'*. The tribes are at a safe distance in the Gairosir. Typhus,,hunger and unemployment have largely spared the town so far. Leaders of the Workers* Union may whisper to the poor behind closed doors that the rich have had their day ana that theirs will come; local newspapers may reprint the views of Dr Mueaddiq on oil concessions or those of the Tuaeh Party on Seyyid 2ia-ud-Din; and occasionally a patriotic intellectual will indulge in gloomy soliloquies on what may be the Russian designs in Persia. But the talk of the town is of when the war in Europe will end - whe n it is not merely of such local trivialities as the possible connexion between successive failures of the electric light supply and the fact that of the two cinemas in the town one, owned by a member of the electric light corporation, has a generator of its own and so, unlike its less fortunate rival, is independent of the town supply. The quickening tempo of the war in Europe is not of course to the liking of a large section of the inhabitants of ICemanshah, some 15 or 20,000 of whom probably belong to or are dependants of the merchant class and foresee a speedy end to the brief paradise of wartime prices. There seems to be no realisation either on the part of the merchants, who fear a collapse of prices at the end of hostilities, or of the general public, who hope for one, that Japan may still be fighting long after Germany has been defeated; indeed it is said that the majority of the townspeople pay so little attention to the war against Japan that when listening to news broadcasts they switch off their sets as soon as there is mention of the Far Eastern theatres of war. LOCAL GOVERNMENT : 2. The appointment of Abbas Sadr, formerly Governor of MAlayyer, to be Acting Governor of Pamadan has lent colour to reports that the plans of Sardar Akram, Governor of Ramadan, to secure for himself the post of Governor-General of the 5th Ustan, are muturing. There is still no news ox a Governor for Shahabad. 3. The weak bakhshdar of .asr-i-Shirin, Abdulla Wahid, remains in office, but the Acting Governor-General has received a telegram from the kermanshah deputy Dr Muavin, who returned to Tehran from here on the 8th, confirming that a new man will be sent. There is a possiblli* -fy r jjyu t- ... ahIn ra ay be given the less important post at Herein, replacing tne present cakhshdar Amir Lanishvar (October Diary, paragraph 2), who is likely to be recalled to Tehran, having made many enemies in his few months* at Harsin. X 4. Captain Attabeghi, commanding the Gendarmerie at v^asr-i-Shirin, is being transferred, as a result of the ppor showing made by his subordinates in rounding up the bandits responsible for the recent hola-up on the Naft-i-Sfeah road (December Diary, paragraph 12). 5. Jawad Shirvani, Head of the utate Domains Department at Shahabad (May Diary, paragraph 13), is reported to have been making money for ,hlmaeif by selling leases of domains land at low rents. 6. The new British Cereals Collection Officer, Fl-Lt. Long (December Diary, paragraph 6), arrived in the course .of the month, and has taken up his dutiea. Captain Cosby, Transpb^^ficeri ^ T. ' visited Xermanshah from the llth-26th. Mr E.O. HutBnXh»on f ~ the American Director-General of Finance, has gone to i^gypt tOAbrlttghere his 1‘araily. It is rumoured that he may be transferred to Tehran shortly. This would be regrettable from a local point of view as he ia doin^ *opd work ana is well liked. 7. Although the elections for the Kermanshah Municipal Council were held in duly (July Diary* paragraph 1H) no Council has yet been appointed. The final choice of councillors apy|*ently rests with th ^ Ministry of Interior. Municipal elections have recently been held ^ at Songhur. POLITICAL j 8. There seems no doubt that the Vyorlcer8 , Union (Ittihadiye- i-Xargaran va Zahmatkashan) inaugurated here in December by Dr Forutan and local members of the Tudeh Party (December Diary* paragraph 8) is a branch of the Tudeh labour union, the 'Central United Council” of which in Tehran have telegraphed their 'hearty congratulations on the formation of the Union of the 5th Ustan and (their) hope that under the Union's aegis the Toilers of the west also will succeed in defend ing their rights”. In announcing this message in the ’'Jisitun” news paper on the 20th, Dr Forutan stated that it had been communicated to 'all branches and districts of the 5th Ustan'. Nothing else has been heard of these alleged brandhes but the local luieh Party is reported to haVe decided at a meeting on the 11th upon opening 'branches' at Sahneh* Xangavar ana v asr-i-dhirin, in addition to one said to exist already at Fiarsin. In essence there appears to be little difference between the Xenhanshah Wortcers' Union and the Kermanshah T ideh Party. They share the same premises and the same persons are members of both. 9. The article in the 'Kermanshah' newspaper attacking those responsible for the execrable theatrical shows which marked the inauguration ox the Workers 1 Union brought a long reply to Farajullah .Caviani* editor of the 'Kermanshah', from Dr Forutan* abdsin 0 the police, the army, the education authorities, and the rich 'who ait in warm rooms and laugh at the poor'. Far from publishing Forutan's epistle, Kaviani devoted part of each issue of his paper for three weexs to printing a long ana gruesome account of how Porutan and two friends of his murdered a prostitute for her Jewellery some twenty years ago. The serial concluded with an appeal to the Central United Council of the workers' Union to prevent such an undesirable character as Forutan from having anything to ao with labour mattt,rs. rorutdn retorted by means of an open letter to Kaviani, published in the 'Bisitun' paper on the 28th, with copies to the Central Council and the Tehran newspaper 'Zafar', saying; 'The Tuaeh Tarty and the ♦orkei's’ Unions are not children and do not need a nurse. — The workers have complete confidence in Dr Forutan, the Head ol our Union, ana we know also that you are opposed to the* workers'. 10. A speech made at a recent Tudeh Party meeting is said to have included a statement that 'the unity and progress of the Party in other towns is due to the absence of foreign iniluence.lMBMBMltfBlwaHMaiK Lack of progress in the Lest is due to British influence'. Perhaps in a bid for support in other than Russian garters, Forutan seems to have been doffing his cap to the British in recent speeches arid, while stressing the Tudeh Party's independence of foreign inspiration, to have paid tribute to the services which Britain - ana nussia* - are rendering to the cause of freedoms 'Our policy has nothing to do with either the British or the Soviet Governments. \&gt;e are Iranians and liberals. They are to us as wings to a bird. — Our dear neighbours, the British and the Russians, are making sacrifices for freedom. — V^e should pray God for the victory of the British and the Russians and love them'. These sentiments seem insincere but, as the meetings are not held in public, they may not necessarily be so. 11. A notice published in the 'Siaitun' newspaper on the 7th announced the appointment of a new 'Secretary and liaison member of the Kdalat Party, Kermanahah', in the person of a ^eyyid Abul yaeem Nadimi, and stated that party meetings would be held on Fridays in various parts of the town. Mention was made in the December Diary (paragraph 9) /17. / r ' - 3 - li 1 ^ruph 9), in connexion with, an apparent ir&amp;viv al of religious feeling during Luharrani, of a possible alliance between the ^dalat * artj^ and local mullahs, prompted by the sec^Laristft^iidenciea of the Tudeh Party; otherwise little ha* been heara bi th^t^ilikt 4&gt;arty in this area since its momentary effulgence in KaroH of last year (March biary t paj?agraph 19), under the inspiration of chairman of last Municipal Council* r !&amp;• Well-to-do local citizens who fear the growth of left-wing move ments have been giving their support to a certain Seyyia Mahmud Tabate* bai, a mullah who arrived here some three or four weeks a^o from Meshed and Tehran, ana has been preaching sermons in the mosques defenuing democratic principles, Islamic religious law anu in particular the tenth Commandment. Friends of the Tudeh Party consider him to have been despatched here by S*Jtyi’d Lia- • , * • ' . . * • f 13. Recent enquiries by the .oliticnl Adviser and the A.n.O. have established that the Acting dovernor-u«nei‘aX, dehiaiehahi; the Chief of Police, Colonel Jawad /issfi; the chief of Qustoms, Pezeshkpur; hnd the Acting Chief of Gendarmerie, Colonel Maulavi are all natives of towns in the Russian military zone sad have relations living there. 14. The possibility foreseen in the November Miarj'', paragraph 16, that the &lt; ubadian and baoudian families would attempt to regain their old position in A&amp;lbur territory', at the expense of the A*azami family, may explain a telegram adareaseu to the Acting uovuruor- Generel recently by the Minister of Interior, c once ruing Ua sma Khan A f azami, bakhahdar oi Gilan anu head of the Aalhur tribe. The telegram referred to complaints which had reached Tehran of conditions in Kalhur territory and stated that the Ministry of Interior had no cognisance of ^asem Khan* s appointment (an unpaid one; as bakhahdar of Gilan. In reply, Jehanehahi ie thinking of suggesting that uasem Khan's hand shoulu he strengthened, by appointing him as paid baRhshdaj of the neighbouring district of /iwan, a post nov, vacant. What the area really needs ia the appointment of a good Governor at ^hahabad. The v«ry suitable candidate Jehansuz rhaqani, mentioned in paragraph 4 of the October Liary, has not apparently round favour in the Ministry of Interior and it 1* even rumeured that derim Khan b&amp;ouuian is still intriguing to secure this important post. v .,„. 15. Investigations into the armed hold-up of two Gil Company lorries on the haft-i-uhsh road in Kovembor (PeGember liary, paragraph 12) are still proceeding. The uriver of one of the lorries has identified three tribesmen now in custody in Acrmunshuh. Chots were fired at British military police vehicles on ths road between Khoarovi said qusr-i-dhinn, once on the llth ana again on the 16th. On the lk*th two men and two boys are reported to have been held up and robbsd by armed bandits, possibly K&amp;l&amp;hanis, on the some stretch of roaa. Further east, 150 yards of British military telephone wire was stolen between yasr-i-Shiri* and dar-i-Fol-i- ,ohab on tho night of the 26th. The Political Adviser has since been able to arrange for the headmen of villages along the telephone line from Aerind to Ahosrovi to sign guarantees making each responsible for preventing robberies on his section of the line or paying compsnsation.. There is reason to hope that these arrangemente may prevent further thefts, for in the Bisitun-S^mangar area, west of Kermanshah, no wire has been stolen since four local headmen were fined 10,OCX) rials in July last follow ing on similar arrangements for that area concluded in June (June « Diary, paragraph 16). 16. The local Persian authorities have been so impressed with the efficacy of the scheme for guaranteeing the security of British % military telephone wire through local headmen that they have decided to ask tribal bakhshders td sign guarantees making each responsible for preventing ordinary robberies in his area and for paying compensation when stolen property cannot be recovered. A number of cases of looting have occurred recently in din^abi territory; and the b&amp;khshd&amp;r of Howaueir, Ghulam Hussain Ardelan, has been accusing Ualadbegi tribesmen of raiding within his borders.- 4 - J\ _ _ ^ 17.

Reports are ali*eady circulating that Brigadier Hushimuivi Alshar is try in* to make trouble between kahmoud Khan Knny { eiion of Merivan and the Auroman tribes, ana ii this is true his intention may well be to engineer a situation which he could exploit as successfully as he did Suma paafcici 1 s descent on lierivun last September. 19. The Roghxadi Jaif tribesrnen from Iraq in prison at ScnnandaJ since August (nevember fiary, paragraph 7; were at last brought btilore a w tr*ibmial H on the IBth. They informed this body, which consisted of the governor. Colonel kukhtari representing the X;ivisional Command— er, the Chief of Justice and the Chief of Customs, that they had not underatooa the import of a document which they had been forced to sign, to the effect that they admitted having crossed the frontier illegally bearing arms ana having resisted the Persian military who tried to disarm them, thus rendering themselves liable to imprisonment ana their property to conitscation. It was thereupon intirnfete ^ to ^he Ro Jizadis th»t th~ Persian Government had decided to pardon them and that they were free to depart* The Poghzadis however refused to take delivery pf the few remnants of their confiscated property L and announced their intention of presenting a claim on their return to Iraq for all that hud been stolen from them. The divisional Oommandex* has referred to Tehran for instmetiona. RO. Farayallah /.sal, the dennandaj deputy, returned to Tehran from Kurdistan on the BGth. 81 .

The ban imposed by the Director of Customs at Aiasr-i-Shirin on the trans-frontlet* trade in sugar and piece-goods from Persia and grain from Iraq (December Diary, paragraph 4) drove up the price of bread in .asr-i-nhlrin durln*'January to over SO rials for -5 Kiloa.

Several hundred Persian pilgrims are at a loose ena in the town, having arrived here after the appointed time for entering Iraq. The Iraqi Consul, who can only give them visas now if a special dispensa tion is made, has referred the matter to Bagdad for instructions. it seems that the pilgrims failed to make allowances either for transport difficulties or for the slowness of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in issuing their passports. 36. The Soviet Vice-Consul, .Pavel Pankratov, whose appreciation of U.3. bqmber raids on Tokyo was recorded in last month's Diary, hac given further evidence that although the U.S. i.K. is not involved in the 'Allied war against Japan he for one is not neutral in spirit. In conversation with the Acting Coneul at a recent social function he volunteered the information that Marshal Zhukov, whose victorious armies now threaten Berlin, was the general in charge or the Soviet forces which clashed with Japanese troops on the borders of Outer Mongolia in 1939, Japanese? casualties in which encounter he quoted with unconcealed relish.

BAD I An, th*e i ajlis Deputy, and has threatened to resign ..rom his post as Bakhshaar ^unpaidj and remove to the safety oi Aeraanshah. The precaripusness of his position is further indicated by reports of discora within the a' azami lar.'iily itself, particularly oi the long-standing rivalry between ,asim Khan and his half-brother uhulam Reza, exploited alike by the qubadian faction ana by members oi the tribe. The x^ersian authorities now have to consider whether to replace ,asim Khan (bearing in mind the difficulty of find ing a suitable man to take his place; or to remove Ghulam Reza Khan and settle him elsewhere. The latter solution would appear to be the best, as asirn Ahan could probaoly counter the intrigues of Abbas yibadian ff his own halx—orother v&lt;as at a safe distance. 10. Considerable unrest also exists in the TARlfni area, owing to the rivalry between Anl RUH.u.., AD GHAaARfARI IR A* \ZAii) 9 former Bakhshdar of DKid^Ai^ and son of the late Vali of iiisht-i-Kuh, aiid his cousin AIIARD .AAH KH/ui GH,i£nDFARI, who was recently rejected by the Tarhanis as their Bakhshdar. The 5th uristan Division sent a detachment to Tarhan on x'eceipt of the news that the supporters of Ali Muhammad were arming themselves, presumably to carry out a coup which would reinstate him as Bakhshdar. In the meantime HiioSAK ciAHnDI, the present uakhshuar, has been removed to Delian on orders irom Tehran and the noting oakhshdar of Delian, HAoi K AR ISRATDvRI, has been oraered to Tarhan. In view of the circumstances it »&lt;ould appear to be the wisest course xor the Government to remove both Amanullah Khan and i.li Muhammad Khari as their conflicting ambitions have an unsettling effect on the tribes.

Aqa SASAN, Majlis Deputy for Kermanshah, returned to Tehran empty-handed from his trip to Abadan to ask the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. Ao supply pipes for his scheme to provide Kermanshah town with a piped ater supply (April Diary, para 29) 7. Col. YADULLAH ZAWGANEH, an Air Force Officer and a relative of AMIR-I-KUL has been appointed Military Governor of Roads in the West. HiiD duties, are indeterminate and the general impression is that the Road Security Dept, of the Ministry of War exists principally to provide jobs for unemployed officers. *» 8* Aqa MUhAMMADI, the new Mayor of Kermanshah, (April Diary, para 8; states that the President of the Municipal Council, ABUL MQALI %U, M (March Diary, para 3) is very unsatisfactory and frustrates all efforts to improve the town, repair the main streets, and remove refuse. ABUL MOALI has a bad reputation in town and is moreover in sympathy with the Tudeh Pariy. Aqa Muhammddi states that he will go to Tehran shortly and if he cannot arrange for Abul Moali’s removal, he will himself resign as he.cannot do any useful work while Abul Moali is President of me Municipal Council. The Acting Governor-General as usual will not take a strong line, but goes on trying to make peace between them. Aqa Di-vIHIM, Chief of the Finance Dept, at Kermanshah returned from leave at the end of June. 10. Brig. HUSH HAND jiFSHAR, O.C. Troops in SARNANDA J, is reported to be very unpopular both with the Kurds and with his own officers and men. On the night June 19th libellous notices against him were posted in Sannandaj. It is suspected that they were the work of some of his Junior officers-. POLITICAL: 11. The strike of workers at the Kermanshah Petroleum Company, organised by the local Workers’ Union and Tudeh Party representatives (May Diary, paras 9 - 10) came to an end on June 6th when the six days’ grace accorded by the Company to employees absenting themselxes from work without leave expired and those employees still absent were auto matically discharged. The Company found absolutely no difficulty in engaging new employees to replace the strikers: the first day some 500 men applied for jobs, the next day over 1,000. In the end 363 men lost their jobs as a result of the strike but of these just over 100 skilled men with records of good service were re-engaged after some fltKiHy delay, and some 120 new men were taken on. In this way, the Company were enabled to reduce their labour force to the tune of about 140 men. whom they had hitherto been keeping on from humanitarian motives and discahrging at the rate of one or two per week. The disc^iferged men ap.pealed to the Acting Governor-General and to this Consulate for a retview of their case and the matter was referred to the Company, but thiere was nothing to be done. 12. In the meantime, the Tehran Newspaper ZAFAR of June 5th had published a telegram from the Tehran Central Workers’ Union to the Kermanshah Workers’ Union stating that the strike had been without their knowledge or authority, that it was quite inopportune while the war with Japan was going on, and that it should be ended as soon as possible. There was some doubt whether the Kermanshah Union had received this telegram but the news of its appearance in ZAFaR spread rapidly and brought great loss of face to the local leaders. The final collapse of the strike with the net result of putting over 200 innocent workmen out of work completely ruined the prestige of the Tudeh Party and the Workers’ Union in Kermanshah. For the rest of the month the \ leaders laid very low or found it suddenly necessary to visit other * centres, and the Tudeh Party Offices were practically deserted. There/M ft « JL 3870 Jhere were several attempts to organise derrjonst rat ions, in which those who had lost their jobs were to parade through tfye s^reet^ with their starving wives and children, but these wer^.,pxasliponei and; finally abandoned altogether. There were meetings of high PersT&amp;n officials to decide what measures should be taken if these demonstrations did take place but neither the Acting Governor-General, Aqa JEHANSHAHI, nor the Chief of Police, Cot. *iSEFI, was prepared to do anything at all The O.C. Troops Col. BAYANLOR, however, showed firmness and declared himself ready to take any action that might be necessary. 13. it is reported that there was a meeting of the Tudeh Party in the house of SkYID ABBAS TABATABAI on June 27th. The Editor of the newspaper BISITUN, Aqa MEHDI FRaHPUR was elected liaison agent between Kermanshafci and Tehran, and SEYID MUHAMMAD KAZAZI was relieved of his post as Secretary to the Party. No new secretary was appointed. 14. The BISITUN newspaper, local organ of the Tudeh Party, published a series of attacks on the K.P.C., on the Assistant Manager (Aqa MONTASSER) and on the Labour Manager (Aqa MUSTOUFI) with the usual theme of foreign exploitation of the Iranian workers. 15. The Tudeh party opened a branch at QASR-I-SHIRIN on the 20th June under the leadership of FRAJ TAHERI: its first meeting was held on the 22nd. After the meeting, an employee of the Finance Dept, was attacked and severely beaten in connection with the failure to issue Government sugar rations for the last seven months. On June 29th, there was a further clash when the Tudeh Party brought in a load of ice to sell to the inhabitants at a cheap price. There was a sharp reaction from the vested interests involved, the lorry load of ice was looted and the persons sealing it were attacked and wounded. The Police were unable to stop.the.riot but made a few arrests (c.f. para 5 above). 16. St SANNANDAJ Lt. BAHRAMI, who arrived recently to take charge of the Army wireless station there was suspected ol being a Communist agent. His effects were searched in the presence of the Public Prosecutor and.documents were found proving that he was a Communist agent. He has since been imprisoned pending receipt of instructions from Tehran. Lt* BAHRAMI’s uncle is Director of Posts and Telegraphs at Hamadan, his father holds the same post at QAZVIN, and he was in the habit of speaking to them for an hour or more every night. T#eir removal has also been recommended. 17. The Sannandaj Branch of the EDALAT party receive^ a banner from the former head of the local branch, Aqa SaTVaT, which was presented to the new head u-iqa HA8HIM MU'TAMIL VAZIRI, at a public ceremony on June 17th. Some speeches were made but there were no incidents. 18. Anti-SEYID ZIA* notices printed in Tehran were posted in Sfcnnandaj in June. These attracted much attention and caused consi derable comment. TRIBAL: 19. in the SINJABI tribe things are not going well. The present Bakhshdar, KERIM KHAN BARKHURDARK, is. getting himself a bad name for ©portion and malpractices*. He was practically penniless when appoint* crcL to the post: now he is said to possess 11,000 sheep and millions of Rials in cash. The previous Bakhshdar, ASGHAR KHAN SENJABI, former ly exiled, has now returned to Kermanshah and although he has given guarantees not to take any part in tribal or political affairs he is known to be intriguing heavily against KERIM KHAN. He is also accused of being a Tudeh sympathiser but this is less certain. The result of these intrigues can only be trouble. The Acting Governor-General and the former Political Adviser (Col. PITT) had agreed before the latter’s departure for England that Kerim Khan should be removed but the question of finding a successor (other than Asghar Khan£ who is inaccettal&amp;le) has so far been insoluble. The 0.0. Troops Kermanshah suggests leaving the tribe without a Bakhshdar, making the Kedkhuda of each ,r Tireh M directly responsible for its behaviour, but it is prettty certain that this would only lead to confusion and4 and insecurity. 20. In the AYR OMAN JAiHUNI tribe the quest iorl of ICERIM BEG as 0.0. Gendarmerie at NAUGTJIj and para 17) is still in suspense and apparently no i probably owing to the prolonged Cabinet crisis in Tehran, In the r^gantime MUHAMMAD AMIN BEG, Bakhshdar of Paveh, who is the best l pporteu candidate ror the post, has been absent from Paveh for more than three months and the tribe is complaining bitterly that in his absebce things are going very badly lor them. It is to be hoped that an early decision will be reached. 3870 of the suc^ VWH !CB45h Iliiry fearer a soTUflon, 21. in the KALHUR tribe also, the dispute between the a’ZAMI and the QUB/iDIA^N factions threatens to lead to an outbreak in the near future, trouble having come to a head over certain lands leased by the A* ZAMI brothers from the HaJIZjiDEHS of Hermaushah which ABBAS KHAN QUBADIAU claims as his property. He has sent his brother KHOSHU QUBADIAN to prevent the cultivators from handing over the crops to the A’ZAMIS 1 representatives. The official Bakhshdar, ^qa BALUCH KH0SR0VI (M a ch Diary para 5) has now gone to GILAN where it has been decided to establish the administrative centre of the Bakhshdari but despite his good intentions he js not able to e.-ercise any restraining influence on the rival factions, being supported only yy one clerk and two armed guards. 22. There is a serious dispute between HASSAN BEG, Bakhshear of BA Bi\ JAN I, anei MUSTAFA KHAN QUBADI, over the village of LUSHEH which is the centre of the Bakhshdari ana which HitSSAN BEG c'ajLims to have inherited from his late father nMIR ASAD who usurped it from the other heirs after the death of his (Amir Asad’s) father HaBIBULL^F KHAN BABAJANI. Both protagonists have been repeatedly aaviseu to refer their claims to the courts' o. to arbitration but so far have paid no attention to this advice, and there is grave fear + hat one jr both of them will resort, to Force, to the prejudice of order ana security in that region. AGRICULTURE diND SUPPLIES: 23. The Department of ^gr culture reports that the locust menace in V/estern Iran (May Diary para21) has been effectively dealt with owing to the prompt action taken by this Dept, against the swarms of Desert anc Moroccan locusts which had invaded the PUSH-I-KUH area. 24. The employees of the Kermanshah Rationing Department struck on June 23rd as a protest against the non-payment of their salaries lor the last two months. They returned to work when their salaries were paid up. 25. Aqa ;A3HTIYAHI, Inspector of the Economic Department, arrived from Tehran and discharged 70 employees of the Bread and Cereals Department. It is reported that he has orders to reduce the estab lishment by 200. The local branch of the Tudeh Party t a meeting held on the 27th June decided to contact Aqa Ashtiyari and request him not to dismiss these 200 employees. 26. Government purchases of barley having stopped, the price of this commodity in the Kermanshah area dropped from Rls 800 to Rls 400 per kharvar. A drop in the price of wheat was also expected. 27. The distribution of sugar in the Kermanshah aistrict has caused much discontent. Aqa I'TIMADI, Director of the Distribution Department, stated at the end of June that to provide supplies on the/5 3870 the approved scale, 800 tons were due to tt |e BejtS^ S respect of the Persian year 1323 and 1,000 tons lor 1324, fcyta'l'X,’80O'^tTlhs, against which the Government had authorised the release of 600 tons only from ^e 3HAHABAD sugar factory, and even this could not he transported ujray owing to difficulties with the Road Transport Department (Edareh Barbari Rah) . As a result, some of the tribes had received no sugar at all for 4 months, others for 7 or even 8 months* ©n oune 30th stocks in hand were :~ Sugar, brown M white Tea, foreign Tea, Persian Tea, mixed 90 tons (gross) 60 u of which 32 tons were required for Kermanshah town, leaving only 28 tons for the tribes. 40 tons 53 ' 10 ” ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL 28. Throughout the month all markets continued quiet with prices closing sightly higher. There was some activity in roghan * Money was cheap at 12 to 15%. Harvest prospects were excellent.

Kermanshah; A.L.O, Senna; File, British Consulate, KERMANSHAH, July, 18th, 1945GENERAL: 1. The month was quiet again on the whole. The result of the British General Election was received with some surprise and was a favourite topic of conversation, the general impression among Persians being that England had gone completely Communist, The imminence of the Majlis elections in Persia gave rise to a good deal of obscure oolitical activity and the usual behind-the-scenes intrigues. LOCAL GOVERNMENT: 2. There has been no visible progress towards the nomination of a Governor-General for the Fifth Ustan. It is understood that the proposed appointment of SARDAR AKRAM has been definitely cancelled. It has been suggested that Prince Asadullah SHAMS UULK ARA (Shahab ud Douleh) K.&amp;.V.O., since March 1944 Farmandar of Kurdistan where he has been doing quite well, should be appointed Acting Governor-General until a permanent appointment can be made, but it is still uncertain whether this will go through or not. In the meantime the Acting Governor- General, Aqa JEHANSHAHI, is following his usual laissez-faire policy, w-hich is very trying for the few officials who wc ..Id like to display a little energy if given the opportunity, » 3. Colonel KEMAL, Officer Commanding Gendarmerie at Kermanshah, proceeded to Tehran on July 12th and returned to Kermanshah on the 29th. The object of his visit was to discuss various departmental problems, including the appointment of a Gendarmerie officer in succession to the late KERIM BEG. LAHUNI. at Nausud (June Diary, para 20), and to secure some of the new material which Colonel -Schwarzkopf had purchased during his visit to the U.S.A. Col. Kemal stated on his return that he had been promised two armoured cars and some radio transmitting and * receiving sets, but men to work the latter have to be trained first by the Americans. 4. Colonel MAULAVI, former O.C. Gendarmerie at Kermanshah, also returned from Tehran to Kermanshah in the latter half of this month to give evidence in the case of the alleged disappearance of smuggled silver captured by the Gendarmerie near Qasr-i-Shirin (April Diary, para 6). 5. Colonel YADULLAH KHAN A’ZAM ZANGANEH (June Diary, para 7) arrived during July to commence his duties as Military Governor of main roads and adjacent Allied military installations from Hamadan to Khosrovi, with jurisdiction over an area of 6 kilometres to the north and south of the road and with power to hand over offenders to the Military Court instead of the normal civil courts where in practice it was impossible to get a sentence against them. Apart from establishing an office in the quarters formerly occupied by the Political Adviser, no activities on his part were observed during the month. 6. Ajnew Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Aqa HAIDAR ALI SEHAT POUR, arrived in Kermanshah on July 19th. he has been Inspector-General in the Posts and Telegraphs at Tehran for the past seven years, previous to which he was Director of Posts and Telegraphs at Khorramshahr for ten years. 7• Aqa Arslan FARHANG arrived from Tehran at the end of the month to take up the duties of Assistant to the Chief of the Municipality He was in the Kermanshah Municipality before but wa^ sent away to Tehran at the request of the Political Adviser of the time (Lt. Col. Fletcher) on suspicion of malpractices in the distribution of the Government bread ration. In Tehran he was given a minor Dost in the Ministry of the Interior, 8. Aqa Buzurg JANABI , Director of the Agricultural Bank, re-££• gur-g—€&gt;'£■• -£ftc—3gtnic t returned to Kermanshah on the 9th July after leave. 9. It is announced that H.I.M. the Shah has donated Rls 2,500,000 towards the. cost of providing Kermanshah with a piped water supply (June Diary ? para 6). Professor WINSOR, American Irrigation Adviser to the Ministry of Agriculture, arrived at Kermanshah on July 25th to study the possibilities of bringing water from SARAB and the QARA $TJ river and returned to Tehran on the 27th. It is reported that if the project is pronounced feasible, a limited liability company will be formed to provide the additional funds needed. 10, The one and only main road of Kermanshah, asphalted free of charge by the British Army Authorities in 1944, is deteriorating rapidly for lack of repairs and is now little better thah a series of gigantic pot-holes. The metalling of the road was also put in by the British Army and should have been paid for by the Municipality, but owing to a dispute between the Chief of the Municipality, Aqa MUHAMMADI and the President of the Municipal Council, Aqa ABU MOALI (June Diary, para 8) it has not yet been paid for. This dispute has completely paralyzed all brahches of municipal activity. POLITICAL: 11* On the 28th June trouble occurred at FAMRNIN, a large village near Ramadan, when Tudeh leaders went out to try and establish a branch^o- of the party there. The villagers resisted, a fight followed, and there were a few casualties. The authorities made investigations, found that the Tudeh were to blame, and made some arrests. This led to still greater trouble in Ramadan on July 7th when the Labour Union organised a public demonstration outside the Justice Department to demand the release of four of these prisoners. While the delegates of the demonstrators were interviewing the authorities inside the Justice Department, a shot was fired outside and the delegates rushed out and they and the authorities tried to disperse the mob. The mob did not disperse, however, until shots had been fired by the Police. Three demonstrators were wounded and one policeman was fatally stabbed. Two of the three leaders, JA’FAR DAULATSHAHI and YUIL LEVON, fled from Ramadan and their whereabouts are still unknown. 12, Following' these'events, a session of the Tudeh Party committee was held in Kermanshah on July llth at which mutual recriminations were exchanged, SEYID ABBAS TABATABAI accusing MUHSIN ALAVI of mishandling the affair by sending DAULATSHAHI to Ramadan and bringing the party into disrepute, whiles ALAVI held Engineer ATIQACHI responsible. ATIQACHI, who appears to be Tudeh Parry inspector for Western Iran himself went to Ramadan to try and straighten things out but was not able to accomplish anything. . The Tudeh Party in this district has been further weakened- following its^etback over the Kermanshah Petroleum Company strike and ^ the events in Ramadan asst by the transfer of one of its leading lights at Kermanshah, Dr. AiWAR SHARI, Director of the Red Lion and Sun Hospital at^Kermanshah, who has been removed to Tehran* Re left on July 24th. Another leader, MUHSIN -h.L«VT, principal of the Shahpur School at Kermanshah is also expected oo be transferred shortly. The third leader, Engineer ATIQACHI, does not seem to have much driving force celebtatioh was held at the Homay Cinema, Kermanshah on July 25th in honour of the 2nd anniversary of the foundation of the Freedom Front. The Consular Corps was invited but did not attend. A number of speeches were made but most of them were non-controversial in nature. The show was quite well organised and arrangements for the reception of the guests were excellent. A cinema show concluded the proceedings. _ In QABR 4 !!-SHIRTN no special Tudeh activity was reported during July. Elsewhere in the province the party has also remained quiescent. In SANANDAJ and surrounding villages there was some propa- gandabut the Tudeh Office has not yet been officially opened though it has distributed its first manifesto calling on the peoole to join the party, ' 0 TRIBAL:.■i-iilL -L 3n Ij I - a - ^ KERIM KH^N BARKHaRDARI, Bakhshdar of ;he tribe Uune Diary, para 19) has, as anticipated, been ii trouble.'His .pre decessor and rival, ASGHAR KHAR 3AKHTIAR SINJABI aas^offlplajjied that some 20 Persian Army rifles which had been entrusted ‘tdAfeihJir Khan anu distributed by him to his henchmen had been seized by Kerim Khan and disposed ofi-without the knowledge of the proper authorities. Three, it Wo.s alleged, had. been smuggled across the frontier andi / s^ld in Khanania^ ^ne others had disappeared. The O.C. Troops summoned Kerim Khan' to nermanshah and held him there while an officer, Lt. KERIMI, went to SinjaDi to investigate, at the end of the month Kerim Khan was still detained in Kermanshah but the O.C. Troops had promised H.M, Consul that he would be allowed to return just as soon as Lt. Kerimis invest igations were completed, J 7 * /T The KALHUR tribal dispute between the A'Zidkll and QU3ADIAN factions (June Diary, para 21) still goes on. The O.C. Troops and the Acting Governor-General summoned the pairties to Kermanshah and tried to arrange an amicable settlement, but this proved impossible. At one moment the A'ZAMIS collected some 200 armed retainers in SHAHA3AD and threatened to start trouble but the summons of the leaders to Kermanshah averted an outbreak. 18. In KULIAI the family dispute between AMIRI and AMJADI, leading landowners of SUHGHUR (April Diary, para 14), again came to a head and both parties came to Kermanshah co try and arrange matters. It was.agreed that a party composed of the Acting Governor-General, th e Directors of the Justice, Finance and Registration (Sabt-i-Asnad) Departments should go out to KALA SAFID to examine the question of water rights on the spot and try to reconcile the disputants. H.M. Cons also agreed to join the expedition but strictly as a spectator. The J expedition did not actually take place till August 3rd» After much * discussion an agreement was finally reached and signed by both parties timebein- d at h f^ast iS wil1 impr0VG the tranquillity of the area for the* u h ? ve been man y complaints recently about the conduct oi the JavaiYRUDIS who are again getting themselves a bad name.

They are also under suspicion of some sort of collusion with the aUROM^H REa^BIS against whom the Persian Army is now engaged in a punitive expedition (See next para). f , HaSSAH KHAN REZABI, MAHMUD KHAN DTZLI and MAHMUD KHAN KANI HaNaNI have for some time past been engaged in acts of brigandage and lawlessness, including the seizure of lands belonging to various land- owners of SANANDaJ, and have ignored repeated warnings from the Persian and British authorities calling on them to submit to Persian Government control and mend their ways. Finalljr, after the last ultimatum had bee' ignored, the Persian Army sent out a column from SANANDAJ under the x command of Sartip HUSHMAND AFSHAR to bring them to reason. This column advanced to AB I HANG, border of REZABI territory and after a final call to negoti ation had been disregarded, the troops advanced in mid thnt H? 7 'S territory proper On the 14th July, it was announced that RjjZaB itself had been taken after some fighting and casualties on both sides, but it was subsequently learned that the town itself had MAHMTTn e Tm?AT C ?r?iT? d Q! ) ATKT? nly -?2 in9 bei f hts surrounding it.

The attach was beaten off after heavy fighting, but the position was so seriou s&gt; that Col. BAYENDOR, O.C. Troops at Kermanshah was rushed to MERIVaN with reinforcements a thousand strong from here situation. Reinforcements were also rushed in from Tehran and SAQ^IZ. At the end of the month, the fighting was still continu ing and th e iersian military were so secretive about it that there was reason to suppose that all was not going according to plan.

On the llth July, his nephew and rival EZZAT BEG son of the late KERIM 3EG succeeded in getting the pay of the AUROMANI LAHUNI Gendarmerie issued and taken to KHANAGAH but it is reported that absolutory none of the money reached the Gendarmerie them selves. AGRICULTURE Sc gUPPLIES: 23. Reference June Diary, para 27, 300 tons of sugar were distrib uted to the tribes by.the Economic Department in July, Estimates of th e amounts which the officials concerned put into their own pockets as a result vary from Rls 600,000 to Rls $00,000. 24* Aqa ABHTIYaNI, Inspector of tne jggonomig Department, who has c j :iar 6e 01 distribution here in the absence of the Director, Aqa went ^0 Palestine for medical treatment, has had trouble with tn-e bakers over.th-e sale of Government flour. With good harvest prospects the price of wheat has dropped from Rls 1,500 to Rls 800. per zcharvar, and the gap between the price of Government bread and ,, free M oread has become much smaller. As a result the bakers selling Government bread have had difficulties in marketing their wares, and Aqa ASHXIYANI has had to abolish the admixture of 20^ barley in the flour and also to take steps to ensure that the wheat is cleaned and ground much better than before, ue still had to try and dispose of 600 tons of Government flour which would not keep, and wished either to close the ’’free 1 ’ bakeries for a time or else to make them take Government flour. This caused so much opposition that a Commission was held at the Municipality and it was finally decided that the Government bakeries must use the flour or pay a fine of Rls 4,000. As 'free' bread sells at Rls 10 per 3 kilos and Government bread, which is not of such good quality, at Rls 9 per 3 kilos, the Government bakers claimed that they would not be able to aispose of their bread unless the price were reduced, Aqa A3HTIYANI nov/ever, said that the government could not reduce the price as they had bought wheat at high prices and had already suffered enormous losses by subsidising the sale of bread. ^ P r °s?ects are still excellent and wheat prices are steadily. ^ thunderstorm with so$e rain late in July accelerated tiic fcil2t since it is believed locally that ripe grain which has been rained will not keep.and landlords and peasants have therefore fastened to dispose of their surpluses.

Russia^ gRXK entry into the war against Japan passed almost without comment, most Persians having long ago lost interest in the Far Eastern struggle, about the ultimate issue of which they were in no doubt. A few did remark pessimistically that it put an end to their hopes of a split between the Russians and the Anglo-Americans but the confirmed optimists thou^nt tnat the split would still come over the division of the Asiatic spoils. The Japanese surrender following so soon after rtussia’s declaration of war was also received with singular lack of interest and had no appreciable effect either economically or politically except to sharpen speculation regarding the prospects of the depart ure of Allied troops from Iran. No Persian, either official or non official, gave any parties or receptions to mark the end of hostilities and there was absolutley no sign of public rejoicing or holiday - making. LOCAL GOVERilMFhT: 2. At long last a new Ustandar has been appointed for the Vth Ustan: Aqa Fathullah Khan KALANTARI, who has been serving as a Director-General in the Ministry of Interior and was formerly in the Ministry of Justice. He arrived on 19th August and spent the rest of the month meeting local officials and personalities and studying the problems of his new province, which he discussed at great length with H.M. Consul when first calls were exchanged. He had taken few decisions before the end of the month but planned to go on a tour to Shahabad, Ilam and Q&amp;sr-i-Shirin early in September and make his recommendations personally to the Prime Minister. 3. Another appointment long vacant, that of Farmandar of SHAHABAD, has also been filled by the appointment of KHUSRU QUBADIAN, brother of ABBAS QUBADIAN(AMIR MAKHSUS), Majlis# deputy for Kermanshah and former chief of the Kalhur tribe. There is every reason to believe that the Prime Minister made this appointment^ against his better judgment and without consulting or informing H.M. Embassy, on the insistence of Abbas Qubadian whose votq was necessary to reinforce his extremely slender majority in tne Majlis#. For the effects of this appointment see para 14 below. Following a dispute with Aqa Ma'qul, Director of the Department of Justice at rvermanshah, Colonel MUKRI has been relieved of his appointment as Farmandar of Ilarn, This post he had held before the Allied troops entered Persia and he had continued to rule PUSHT- i-KUH very much as a military dictator after the fashion of neza Shah’s regime. All accounts agreed, however, that he kept excellent order in his remote and turbulent district and ruled it well without the use of armed force,,of which indeed he had practically none at his disposal. His successor is ABUL HASSAN SBPEHR who arrived in Kermanshah on August 28th from Tehran. He is the son of LISAN SEPEHR, Inspector- General of the Ministry of Interior, and is apparently without any experience whatsoever of executive administration though he has served for a time in the Min J 'ry of Interior in Tehran. He left Kermanshah for ILAM early in.Sep ber. /52 5. Aqa Baluch KHOSROVI (See March Diary para 5.) has removed from the Bakhshdari of GILAN. It is reported that he will be appointed Bakhshdar of SAB ?UL-i-B0HA3. Aqa SALEHI, Chief of tne distribution Department, re^’T^ 0 ^ on August 8tn from leave in Palestine whither he had gone for medical treatment for himself and his wife. Aqa SHOKHAI, Director of the Department of Education ; has been appointed Inspector in tine Ministry of Education in Tehran ' ?d left in tne middle of August. He is a sonrinrlaw of SARDAR AXnAU ? Governor of Ramadan. His successor is Aqa Hussein Ali AHSAHI, former' Director of Education at Isfahan. 8* MOHS EH ALI QaRAGOELCJ (SARDAR .aKRMM) returned to Hamad an on August 9th and resumed his duties as Farmandar after a ver Tr lc v absence in the capital (c.f. June Diary para 3) during which the administration in Hamadan had become chaotic. It is to be hoped that he will be able to stay long enough to restore some semblance d order before he finds it necessary to return to Tehran again. POLITICAL: S. The Tudhh Party has been lying very low in Kermanshah, apparently engaged in licking its sores. Owing to lack of funic. . ; office in the main street was closed and its headquarters tran.s' ''.u c to the office of the Labourers’ Union in the garage area. Ac a Si an agent of the party from Tehran, arrived and took over the sea^s cl the party secretariat from Aqa KAZZAZI. He told a meeting of party members that he had never seen such disorganisation and incompete' anywhere and made various accusations against local leaders i’ - party which were violently resented by them and their followers uth the result that pandemonium reigned at the party meetings and p _ no public activity was evident. 10* 1^ Hamadan also there was little Tudeh activity. One of the first acts of bardar Akram, the Governor, on his return from -hran was to summon ALI AK3AR HOwRASSI, the local Tudeh leader and . aiwi 'in against holding meetings in public and creating disturbances. j.:i .e villages too the agitation directed against giving the landlozvs loir share of the crops has died down and no further outbreak of disorder was reported. H* In SANAHDAJ also attempts to open a branch of the Tudeh party met with complete failure owing to a concerted drive by the local officials and landowners aimed at dissuading the few wtmldrbe adherorhs from joining up. As a result the party never even managed to get its signboard up in Sana^daj. 12. ^ In KERIHD two emissaries from Kermanshah attempted with the assistance of two local officials, one of them a Police and one a Gendarmerie officer ? to open a branch of the Tudeh party. While they were holding a meeting for the purpose of enrolling members they T ere attacked by supporters of the ’Adalat party who dispersed the meeting, doing a certain amount of material damage in the process.‘Colonel KEMaL, O.C. Gendarmerie at Kermanshah, summoned his man to Kerma: ;hoh to report but Colonel ASEFI, O.C. Police at Kermanshah, who displays a notable tenderness where the Tudeh is concerned, refused to summon his man. Two of the ’Adalat party supporters engaged in the attache, both men of Aqa Abul Hussein HA/ATI, the leading landowner and nc i”- of Kerind, were imprisoned following this incident and Hayati himself got into a certain amount of trouble with the authorities who professed to consider him responsible for the breach of public order that rd occurred, and which they said had to be punished although the outcome of it was very muen to their liking. /l3.s - 4 1 3. Following the end of the war with Japan the notorious internee Seyid Abul Qasim iVASHAtfl was released on August 16th, Instead of leaving immediately for Tehran he remained for a time in Kermanshah where his internment was regarded rather as a martyrdom and his undoubted pro-German affinities seemed to increase rather the decrease his popularity. He made a number of anti-Allied speeches ar made it clear that he intended to return to-return to the political ^arena. ** TRIBAL: I 4 . Khusru QU3ADIAN 1 s appointment as Farmandar of SHAHAB^D (see para 3 above) threatened to bring on a crisis in the affairs of the KALHUR tribe (c.f. July Diary para 17) where his family has been under an eclipse si^ce 1926, when his brother Abbas Khan Quhadian, Amir Makhsus, was derived of his lands and headship of the tribe by Reza Shah and removed to Tehran where he spent eleven jsears in prisor In his place Reza Shah appointed ALI AQA A’ZAMI chief of the tribe. Abbas Khan recovered his liberty in 1941 and in 1942 Ali Aqa was murdered, probably at the instigation of Abbas Khan. Ali Aqa's son, QaSIjA KH^A A'ZAivil then became Bakhshdar of GILAJf and de. facto head of the tribe though he was never confirmed in this position by the Ministry of interior, meantime, yibbas ivhan Qubadian, who had returnee to Tehran as deputy of .the- Majlis#, had been agitating and intriguing as hard as he could to get back his lands and to oust the A'zamis from the position of wealth and importance they had acquired in the tribe. Owing to the precarious constitutional situation of the Prime Minister, Aqa Sadr, who h,ad no reliable majority and no vote of confidence from the majlisa, *ibbas Khan was able to force the appeintf- ment of his brother Khusru t^ubadian as Farmandar of shahabad which in effect gives him complete control of the Kalhur tribe and undisoutW superiority over his hated rivals, the A’zamis, who, being rich, powerful and well-armed after enjoying the spoils of office for twenty years, were not disposed to submit tamely to this situation which involved their spoi\jL)ation and degradation, if not their actual liquidation, for which the recent and unpunished murder is a terrify**# precedent. The newly arrived Ustandar, Aqa Kalantari, tried his best y to compose the differences between the two factions in an amicable manner but without much success. Thanks to the counsels of patience and prudence which were offered to the A’zamis they refrained from acts, of violence despite many provocations but at the close of the month the outlook was very black. 13* ^ ^ MUHAMMAD AMIN BEG, Bakhshdar of PAVEH and Sarparast of the AUROMAN LAHUNI tribe (ref. JulyDiary para 22.) returned from Tehran in the middle of August. He did not succeed in obtaining the appointment of Captain (Sarvan) of the Lahuni Gendarmerie held by his late brother KERIM BEG but it is understood that both he and his rival, EZZAT BEG, son of Kerim Beg, are to be appointed Lieutenants and to share the command. Ezzat Beg was unwilling to accept this solution and went off to Tenran to try and upset it. Meantime Mohd. ^min Beg on his return to Paveh took up witn the JaVANRUDIb the variorS acts of aggression (c.f. Jul^ uiary para 19) committea by them during his absence and succeeded in making a pact of friendship with them. This cut away the ground from under the feet of Ezzat Beg who had been counting on Javanrudi support, Mohd. Amin Beg further strength ened his position by getting all his brothers and nephews with the exceptional Ezzat Beg to sign a document recognising him as leader of the tribe and promising to obey him at all times. These two diplomatie triumphs of Mohd, ^min Beg have greatly improved the prespe/^ of peace and tranquility in the Lahuni area. 16 • Reference July Diary para 20, news of the REZABI fightin~ continued very scanty. On the 12th August the Persians occupied REZAB and established their military headquarters there but the tribes, fa:/’ /from- 4 ^u-bmittiry tiisii? uai - ^i n fastnisses/an^^setf f' ^ down to guerilla warfare, passing tiie ^yrsian Career, y *// with their communications and supplies. The. j^oad from SANANDA! to hfibKiS made very slow progress through difficult country and supply problems were acute for the comparatively large Persian forces . 1 .uv 0 .&lt;xM estimated at 10,000 or even 12,000 men. The trieesmen obviously intended to hold out until the end of summer made communications impossible and forced the Persian ^rmy to retire. On «.ugust 24tli Brigadier Husnmand ^fshar invited three influential Sanandajis co ^ headquarters at riezab and tried to send them out to negotiate peace terms with the rebels but they were afraid to venture into the wilds and the tribesmen could not be induced to come down and talk so the projected negotiations could not take place. The attampt however shows that the Brigadier is not happy about the outlook and would b&lt;- glad to get out of the impasse if he could find a way. AGRICULTURE and SUPPLIES • 17.

The month has again been quiet, the province remaining in a state of suspended animation while the new Gov ernor-General, FATHULLAH' KALANTARI, went off to Tehran to try and. get his proposals accepted by the Ministry of the Interior (c.f. paras. 2 to 9 and 13 below;. Local GOVRnNMSNT: &lt; 2 f The new Governor-General of the Vth Ustan made a hasty tour to GNAHANAjj, GiLAN, I LAM, QASH-i-SHININ and NFNIND in the early part of the month, returning to Kermanshah on September 7th. He held a reception at the Governorate on the ^d-i-Fitr^ and left on September 9th for Tehran where he remain ed until the 26th September, For his activities on tour and the objects and results of his visit to Tenran, see paras. 3 to 9 and 13 below. 3, Aqa HUSSEIN HISHMAT SANI’I has been appoint ed Farmandar of Nermanshah and Assistant of the Ustandari of the Vth Ustan. Little is known of him except that he is an old man of 60 or so without presence, energy or influence. 4. Aqa AHMAD JEHANSHAHI who had been Acting Ustandar of Kermanshah for 13 months before Kalantari's appoint ment and had again been in charge during Kalantari’s visit to Tehran was releived of his appointment at the end of September and was expected to leave for Tehran shortly after. He had done pretty well during his tenure of authority In spite of his com paratively low grade in the official hierarchy - his real appointment was that of Assistant Farmandar - which put him at a disadvantage in his dealings with the senior officials in the province. Though somewhat lacking in authority and unwilling to make important decisions, defects also partly attributable to his lack of seniority, he had managed to keep the province quiet, peaceable and orderly and had co-operated very satisfactorily with the Allied occupying authorities, in this part of Iran almost exclusively British. It is believed that Aqa Kalantari, anxious to bring in his own henchmen and start with a clean slate, had offered Jehanshahi the Farmandari of Qasr-i-bhirin but this post Jehanshahi, who suffers from malaria, was unwilling to accept because of its bad climate. There have been reports during the last two or three months that Jehanshahi has been lining his pocket but these reports have been vague and un-sub stantiated and there has been nothing ih his train de vie to suggest that he had any money at his command, 6 . ABUL HaSSAN SEPEHH, the newly appointed Farmandar of ILAM (August Diary, para. 4.) left early in the month for his new post, where he was almost immediately visited by Aqa Kalantari during his tour of inspection (c*f. para. 2 above). In view of his comparative youth and inexperience, the wildness and remoteness of his district, and the reaction which might be expected to follow the removal of the firm hand of Colonel Mukri, the Governor-General was at some pains to strengths his position as far as possible and gave him a lot of good advice, especially impressing on him the importance of keeping in close and constant personal touch with the TUSHMALS or tribal chiefs of PUSHfi-KUH whose collaboration is absolutely necessary to the maintenance of order. The Governor-General also succeeded — /during* — —for export but there is no indication that the Government intends to buy this quantity and if they do not the land* owners and peasants will have great difficulty in disposing of it. The Government's buying programme for this area was 20,000 tons against which undertakings for 15,000 tons have been received. Wo arrangements have been made for the purchase of the other 5,000 tons. 'Free' bread is plentiful at about His 8 per man. ^s this is cheaper than Government bread no Government bread is on sale and no Government grain or flour is being issued to bakers-.

Mr Ryan, Controller of the Ministry of Information, Cairo accompanied by Major Nesham, Army Director of curvey, Palestine arrived in Kermanshah on September 6 th and stayed one night. Major Nesham also stayed one night on his return on September 11 th. The office of the ^rea Liaison Officer, Sanandaj was closed on September 15th, The Major Oakshott who had also been acting as n.L.O. Kermanshah, returned to Kermanshah and closed that office on the 21st September, The Sub Area Commander however protested that the A.L.O. Kermanshah was necessary so long as the British troops are here and it was therefore reopened on September 30th, The office of the A.L.O. Ramadan was closed on September 29th but the Vice-Consulate Ramadan which has hitherto been combined with the A.L.OJs office, remains in being, Mr E. Sykes formerly Vice-Consul Isfahan having assumed charge from S/Ldr D»Aeth on September 13th, S/Ldr D Aeth left Ramadan on September 28th and Kermanshah on September 29th en route for Bagdad. i 23 * t , On the night of September 2/3, 4,080 yds Army copper wire were stolen near Bisitun, On the 5th September a further 2 , 880 yds of wire were stolen near Hamza'Abad but thanks to prompt action this was recovered, It is reported that most of the British troops are to be moved out of the KERMa.NSHAH/BISITUN area by about the middle or end of November. 25 * On ’Id-i-Fitr*(September 8 th) H.M.

The decision of the Majlis to postpone the new elections until after the depart ure of the Allied troops met with general approval. The fall of Sadr’s Cabinet on the 21 st October was received most apathetically. 2-. The Governor-General held a Salaam on October 26th on the occasion of the Shah's Birthday. At the first sitting, at which he received only the staffs of the Soviet and British Consulates and representatives of the British community, he made a little speech thanking Iran's Soviet and British Allies for all the help they had so generously given during the war years and hoping that this assistance would be continued during the coming years until the independence of Persia under a democratic regime was fully established. iOCAA, KliOJT, 3. = The Governor-General, Aqa NALANTARI, who had re turned from Tehran on Bptember 26th, remained in Nermanshah (all through October. He seems to be settling down pretty well ;and is slowly acquiring a useful knowledge of the problems ; of the /th Jstan. He is of a cautious temperament and rather I slow when it comes to making important decisions. He has ? however, already made many changes among the local officials, vide following paragraphs. 4. Colonel ASEFI, Chief of Police at Kermanshah, left for Tehran on October 3rd reputedly on transfer to Tabriz in the same capacity. He was, however, most unwilling to go to Azerbaijan and it was later learnt that he had managed to secure a post for himself in Tehran instead. His successor, Lt. Colonel ISFANDIARI ? arrived on October 8 th, He was Assistant Chief of Police in Kermanshah four years ago when he acquired the reputation of being not very honest. After wards he was Chief of Police at Zenjan but latterly he has been at Tehran without employment, . 5. Major MASHALLAH SHAKIBA was appointed Special Inspector of Police at Kermanshah. He has been Chief of Police in many towns and is reputed to be and active and honest official. His post is a new one. 6 , Aqa MaHQUL, Chief of the Justice Department and President of the Court of Appeal at Kermanshah, left on October 5th for Tehran on transfer. It was reported that he had been appointed Vakil-i-’Umumi at Tehran but later it was rumoured that he had succeeded in arranging his return to Kermanshah. He is popular and greatly respected here. 7. Colonel MIR FlitfDARISKI, G.C. Gendarmerie at Sanandaj, left on transfer to Ahwaz and was succeeded by his assistant,’ Colonel IRAN?OH, Colonel mir FindarisKi was an inefficient and venal officer whose departure from this area is no great loss. 8 . Colonel 3AYEND0R, G.C. Troops at Kermanshah, /whriwho went to MiLitlVAh on July 21 st to take part in the campaign against MAHMUD KrIA 1 KAx^I SANAJI, rlASoAN KHAN nEZAHI and AAixuiUj iuiAN liXZHI (c.f. July uiary, para 20), returned to Kermanshah at the end of October and resumed his command, Lt, dolonel NAJI. who had been Chief of Staff and Acting Commander here, left at the same time for Tehran on transfer. His successor as Chief of Staff is Lt,-Colonel NASHULLAHI, who used to be Chief of Staff a. ^^NuAJ and was as anti- British and unhelpful as possible there. 9. Aqa ABUL HASSAx'i SEPEHH, Harmandar of ILAii (c.f. September Diary, para 5), visited Kermanshah for a few days about the 21 st October. According to local report he has been taking bribes wholesale in Ilam but lost all his ill-gotten gains by gambling during his visit here. 10. The Ministry of Interior has been trying hard to get the Ustandar to accept KERIM KHAN DAUDIAN (Sardar Nusrat) as Farmandar of QASR-i-SHIRTN in place of RIZA NURI (c.f. September Diary, para 9). Tie is an uncle of ABBAS QUBADIAN, Majlis Deputy for Kermanshah, who is pressing hard for the appointment to be made. ABBAS QUBADIAN has already got his brother KHUSRU QUBADIAN appointed Farmandar of SHAHABAD, much against the Governor-General’s will and if KERIM KHAN DAUDIAN is appointed to QASR it means that half the Ustan will become to all intents and purposes the private domain of ABBAS QUBADIAN. Up to the end of the month the Ustandar had succ essfully resisted all attempts to foist KERIM KHAN DAUDIAN upon him. 11 * Rr aBDUD HaMIjj zANGaNEH, Majlis ueputy, arrived in Kermanshah on October 3rd ana stayed until the 14th. He was visiting his relative ^.iviln-i-KULD, former wovernor-General ot Kermanshah, who has been very ill for the last two months. Dr zANGANEH was most careful to explain to persons he met that although he was a member of the Majlis minority he was emphatically not a member or supporter of the Tudeh party. TRIiHiL: 12. The tension in the RA^iHUr (BAVANDPUR) tribe between the QUBADIAN and the A’ZAMI factions has continued throughout the month though again there has been no open breach. The A’ZAMIS. however, appear to hatfe lost ground on the whole and one of their relations, Aqa SARHADDAR, who went to Tehran to try and arrange terms for them, was arrested there by the orders of the Persian General Staff. At the end of the month he had been released thanks to the intervention of the British Embassy but not allowed to return to Kermanshah. Half-hearted attempts at^disarmamnnt continued throughout the month but the QUBADIANS showed no disposition to give up their own and their friends* arms voluntarily and the Governor-General was able^ to frustrate most of their efforts to disposses the A'ZAMIS of their arms under the pretence of disarmament. 12. In the SINJABI tribe the position continues un* satisfactory. KERIM KHAN BARxiHURDARI, the Bakhshdar who was installed (largely at the^instance of the British authorities) as Bakhshdar_in place of ASGHxR KHAN SINJABI has been suspended from his duties while the accusation of having sold Persian Government rifles (c.f. July Diary, para 16) is under inves- 1 * tigalian by the Military Court and the acting O.C. Troops, who is a friend of AGaHAR KuaN has beenjjto put in a military officer as Tribal Security Officer. The uovernor-General, however, is resisting this attempt, preferring to have a civilian Sarparast rather t?ar a military officer in charge /of theof the area. There is, however, no post for a regular official of the Ministry of Interior and any unofficial Sarparast must of necessity be a member of one of the leading families of the tribe and consequently a friend of either ASGxiAH idiAJ or of K£nIM ArUJ. 60 far the only name proposed for the appointment is that of HUSoiilh ^Zlhl IaVaH, an elderly and respected tribal leader who has considerable estates at and is tnerefore unlikely to descend, like iChxiIM KHAi'I, to doubtful means of enriching nimself at the expense of the tribe. 14. It has also been prooosed that SIRDAR NASIR, brother of Dr KERIM KHAN SINJABI and father of ASGHAR KHAN (see preceding para.) should be allowed to return to the tribe from Kazvin where he has been living since Resa Shah expelled him from these parts. The acting O.C. Troops approves of his proposed return but the Governor-General disapproves. 15. From Kurdistan there was practically no news of the military operations against Mahmud Khan DIZLI, Hassan Khan REZABI and Mahmud Khan KANI SANANI. although Persian Army circles professed to regard the campaign as practically at an end, Brigadier FAZLULLaH HUMAYUNI (September Diary, paras. 10 &amp; 15) showed notable reluctance to take over command from Brigadier HUSHMAND ^FSHixR and showed considerable concern about -the situation ixO nis talk with General Lochner (see para. 26 below). 16. On the evening of October 7th there was a hold up on the main Kermanshah/Sanandaj rT^gd at F^Q-i-SUL^IM aN in the course of which one man (the brother-in-law of the Persian Director of Finance at Kermanshah) was killed and another wounded and the personal and household effecta of Brigadier Humayuni were all stolen. Fortunately his family had passed the spot in another vehicle a short time before. The Gendarmerie took immediate steps to follow up the brigands but up to the time of writing there is no news that they have been traced or the stolen goods recovered. It is thought that the robbers may have been either KULIAI or JAVixNRUDI tribesmen. 'POLITICAL*, 17. There was little political activity in Kermanshah during October. The postponement of the Majlis elections till after the departure of the Allied troops from Iran temporarily put a damper on the activities of the numerous would-be candidates for the four seats of which Kermanshah disposes. 18. The Kermanshah branch of the Tudeh Party, whose membership after the abortive strike at the Kermanshah Petroleum Comapny had fallen to fifteen or tv/enty persons, showed signs of coming to life again during October, v/hen it was reported that its membership had reached 300 and that the numbers attending its regular meetings were increasing, largely through roping in unemployed workers whose services had been dispensed with by the British ^rmy, the Kermanshah Petroleum Company and the U.a.C.C. No public activities were observed during tne month, however, though at the end of the month they let it be known that they were.organising a demonstration at Kermanshah for the occasion of the 23th anniversary of the Red Revolution. /AGRICULTURE &amp; SUPPLIES:AGRICULTURE &amp; SUPPLIES: 19. Good rains fell all over the province at the very end of October, to the satisfaction of the agricultural community. 20 . oome anxiety is still felt over the disposal r-N of the 1945 crop surplus for which at present there is no visible market. The Persian oovernment is not buying and private buying has practically stopped, most persons having already covered their requirements until next harvest. Even the 1944 crop has not yet been completely disposed of. Unless the grain is to be exported, of which there are no signs at present, there appears to be no prospect of liquid ating the excess. There is, at the moment, no demand from other centres in Persia. 21. The director of the Economic Department complains bitterly of the disorganisation and lack of co-operation displayed by his Department in Tehran. Failing to get any sort of reply to his most urgent telegrams, he finally went to Tehran himself to try and get some action. He finally succeeded in getting an order allocating to him 900 tons of sugar at SULTANABAD and 1,000 bales of cloth at Khorramshahr and a firm promise that these would be transported to Kermanshah immediately and delivered to him. With these assurances he returned more or less satisfied to Kermanshah but.day succeeded day, neither sugar nor cloth arrived, and again his most urgent telegrams evoked no reply whatsoever. At the end of the month he had received neither sugar nor cloth. ECONOMIC &amp; COMMERCIAL: 22 . The month started with slightly, more activity in the bazaars. Money, however, remained plentiful with the Bazaar rate of Interest quoted at 12/o to about 15/. a fair demand was in evidence for piece-goods and roughan, but all business tapered off again. BnlTIBH INTEREbTS: 23. Colonel Pybus, Military attache to H.m, Embassy Tehran, visited Kermanshah on October 3rd to October 5 th and called on the Governor-General and ©fficers Commanding Troops and Gendarmerie with whom he discussed a number of problems. 24. Mr Bidwell, Acting British Council Representative in Persia, visited Kermanshah on October 4th to 5 th and investigated the possibilities of selling the Council’s bokks and opening an ^nglo-Persian Institute here. Though the possibilities were judged to be very' promising, the Council's shortage of British staff precluded the immediate opening of an institute in Kermanshah but arrangements were made for the supply of English books for sale here. Mr Bidwell again passed through Kermanshah on the night of 26th to ,27th October on his way to Bagdad, en route for the U.K. 25 26 25. _ Mr Wall, Acting British Consul-General at Tabriz, arrived from Cairo on October 7th and left for his post on October 8 th travelling via Sanandaj and MIaNDUaB. • v 26. General LOCHNER, Officer Commanding Persia Area, arrives at Kermanshah on October 6 th accompanied by Mrs Lochner /and left3, and left for Bagdad on October 10th. On October 8 th they went n-nt to CidCihu-ihN, forty miles from Kermanshah on the road to Sanandah to meet SHa Brigadier General HUMaYUNI with whom General ^ochner had a long discussion on the military oosition in Southern Kurdistan and the possibility of working out arrangements for better Irano-lraqi relations and closer co-operation along tneir common ii^ntier in Kurdistan. He promised to do nis best in onis ^irection during his brief stay at nagdaa on his way home to the U.K. H.ivi. Consul at xCermanshah acted as interpreter at this view. Brigadier Humayuni who had flown to Kin-iYi^H specially by plane at short notice, expresseu great gratiouey, lor^ oeneral Lochner’s interest and help in this matter, ueneral Lochner and his wife were entertained at u.M.^Gonsuiate on October 8 th to dinner during the course of whicn tht consul^tL caught fire.

Inoujn the loc «-1 situation remained outwardly fairly satisfactory ,events In Azerbaijan gave rise to much speculation ana anxiety,especially among those elements who nad openly committed themselves to the British connect ion in any way during the Allied occupation Of Iran. Perturbation in the capital was reflected by a creeping paralysis in the local administration which was fast losing the last vestiges of its always precarious autnority, 2. Moharram celebrations passed off uneventfully.There were more mourning processions than in previous recent years but no disorders.Gold weather and heavy rain and deep mud tended to put a damper on open air manifestations. GovernmneJ Officials. 3. It was announced b^ Teh#ran press ana radio on Dec* 20th that Aqa phalli FAiiliwI/Minister of tne Interior in iiaAimi f s Cabinet had been appointed Ustandar of the 5th Ostan.Three days later he announced that he was not accep ting the appointment but was staying in Teheran to answer charges made agaist him by the Majlis Deputy,Dr Musaddiq. These announcements tended to discourage still further the present Ustandar,Aqa Fathallah KAIAUTAKI /vho was already sufficiently depressed by the very obvious lack of support h^ received from the ^rimre Minister of Interior in Teheran who seemed to disregard all his recommendations.After only four months’ occupancy of the post he has already lost the confident optimism he brought from Teheran and begins to look harassed and worn.He has many critics in town where he is regarded as rather a simpleton,and still more among the tribes,wnom he has not handled at all diplomatically. He is however undoubtedly well intentioned and it is a pity that he has entered h,is term of office at a time when there is no policy,no money ana no authority. 4. Colonel AAmAL,Officer Commanding Gendarmerie left for Teheran on Dec 4th for consultation on matters affecting his command and remained absent for the rest of the month. 5. Colonel BAYBUDOrt,Officer Commanding troops,also left for Teheran on Dec 11 th.It was rumoured that he was not returning but was to be replacea by a certain Col.JAVAH3HIH but these rumours proved to be without foundation though Col.bayendor remained absent until the ena of the month. 6 . The appointment of AHwiAD SABAHI as the Farmandar of Hamadan in place of Bardar Akram was announced in Teheran on Dec 23rd./ oardar Akram himself left Hamadan for Teh/ran early in December.Abbas oAnB,the mayor,was still Acting as Governor at the end of the month. 7. • Elections for the new Provincial Council ( Anjuman- i-Ayalati ) under the law passed nearly 40.years ago were - /ordered REfic. r.L 1 r FEB 1946 I INDIA OrTlCEjordered to be begun at the end of December but owing to uncertainties about zhe terms of the law and the manner of its execution,no orogress had been made by the end of the month.A preliminary meeting of notables was held in mermanshah on Dec 23th but r.acn^d no decision. 3, In I-uaA it is reported tnat the new Governor ,Ar 5 UL xiAbbiiD DiPlnh ( uct Diary,para. 9. ) ,is falling under the influence of txae heirs of Ghulam Hussein -vhan Abu Qaddareh the last her-oditary \^ali of Pusht-i-Kuh who aied in exile in Iraq about 10 years ago.They are now claiming tne “return' not onlj oi the late Vali's estates but also of otner lands whicii. he and his ancestors nuver owned, including some whiCxx in neza ah ah 1 s time were made over freehold to the cultivators in an attempt to improve thoir lot.The peasants are finding it a lit.Is difficult to understand why under supposed 'Dictatorship'” the} were given lands while under so-called 'Democracy' their 1 lands are taken from them. TRIBAL. 9 . In Kurdistan the situation had returned to normal, HAS3AN KHAN REZA3I (Nov Diary,para.7) having made hie submission to Brigadier HOMAYUNI,who thus brought/AUROMAN operations to a more or less successful conclusion.This enabled Homayurii to return from Kerivan to Senandaj and set free a number of troops,some of whom were sent to reinforce the garrisons in SAQQIZ,BANEH,and SARDAoHT while others .^ere sent to BIJAR and TANAB,This disposition was intended to prevent any surprise attempt to move southward on the part of the Azerbaijan 'Democrats'. 10 . It v was reported that peac. had been secured in the HALHUA tribe by an a reement between tne A^iZAmls (Nov Diary,para.5) and th^ir rivals tne QUBADIANs.The Acizamis agreed to accept KHUBhU QUbADlAN as Governor of Shahabad on condition that he recognised their property rights ana refrained from oppressing ihem.Contrary to expectations^ so far there; have been very few complaints against xvhusru Qubadian's administration of his Governorate. PO^jiilCAL. •11. As mentioned in tne opening paragraph,conditions have remained outwardly quiet out under the surface the_ Tudeh has gained strenjn^ at the expense of other political parties many of whose adherents,disheartened by the failure of the Moscow Conference as far as Persia was concerned, are hastily taking steps to range themselves on what they suppose to be the winning side.At the end of tne month the Tudsh were protesting vigorously against the terms of the antiquated law for the election of Provincial Councils which denies the vote to most of their supporters.The Governor General hoped to overcome’ this opposition by allowing two o'f their friends to be appointed to the , Supervisory Committee,but this device did not entirely satisfy them. . • AuRlCQ xjTERE AND -SUPPLIES. 12. Rains were plentiful and harvest prospects are good so far but of course anything may happen 'before next June-July.The next requirement is an adequate snowfall during 'January and February to provide water for the Summer months. 13. Difficulty arose about the supply of sugar beet for the oHAiiAbAD sugar factory. The local beut crop tot-: lied /aboutabout 6000 tons but owing to miscalculation or neglect on the part of the officials concerned contricts 'were made for tne transport by motor-lorry of 3000 tons only*When it became apparent to the growers that they were going to be left with 3000 tons on their hands (and sugar beet is a crop which will not keep) they appealed to the Governor General and the .Department of Agriculture who tried to Induce the transporters th/ lift the sugar at the old rate.Owing, to che lateness of the season end plentiful rains^however.owners of motor transport quite naturally refused to lei their trucks work off the main roads unless they were paid handsomely for it. ECONOMIC and COMMERCIAL. 14. Markets remained active for the greater part of the month.Piece-goods were in good demand.Money was tight and interest rates rode from 12 ^ to 13^ last month to 15$ to 24$ this month*The events in Azerbaijan created a scare among the trading community and the price of gold rose tn over Rials 900/ for a gold sovereign.The price of bread also rose from Rials 7 to Rials 10 per man,causing hardship and discontent among the poor; BRITISH INTERESTS. 15. Mr Davis,H.M.Consul at Kermanshah,visited Sanandaj on Dec 5th and 6 th and was the guest of the Farmandar Shams Mulk-Ara (Shahab ud Dauleh).The officials and notables of Sanandaj unanimously regretted the departure of the Araa Liaison Officer Major.R.S.Oakshott,and askec whether a Britisn Consular officer could be established there permanently now that the last representative of the British Military Forces had left,When it was explained to them tnat owing to shortage of staff in the Foreign Service this was out of the question at least for the time being,they insisted that a representative of H.M.Consulate at kerm&amp;hshah should visit Sanandaj two or three times each month at least. 16. Mr.G.C.Boyle,Acting British Vice-Consul at kerman shah,visited '^asr-i-Shirin on Dec 13th. 17. Mr.E.W.Shneerson arrived on Dec 17th to take up his duties as Acting British Vice-Consul at kermanshah. He left for Khanaquin on Dec 2Sth, 18* Captain Williams (Disposals) and Captain Pritchard (Hirings),the only remaining British Army personnel in this area,left for Rhanaquin on Dec23th.Captain Pritchard: is expected to return and remain in Kermanshah until the British campsites have been cleared and handed back to their owners*Captain Williams will not return. 19, The sale of British Army camps at Bisitun was proceeding more or less satisfactorily.Thefts of ai. were much less than had been anticipated.
