FIELD NOTES GENERAL STAFF, INDIA. October 1914:. Catalogue No. M-2—F-O.U.O. SIMLA. PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT MONOTYPE PRESS, 1914, S162(W)GSBCHAPTER I, History. In 1856 a British expedition was sent to Persia to force the Persians to desist from attacking Herat' The expedition landed first at Bus hire. On March 23rd, 1857, however, a force of 1 field battery 2 squadrons, and 1 brigade (loss 4 companies) arrived in ships below Muhammareh. The force numbered 4,886 men, and 12 guns and was accompanied by a naval squadron of 4 steamers, and 2 sloops. The Persians had 15,000 men in 2 camps near Muham- march, and had made several well-constructed batteries on both banks of the Haffar canal. On the night of the 25th-26th March a raft with 4 mortars was established behind an island in midstream, and at daybreak these mortars and the ships opened fire on the Persian batteries. The Persian army though their artillery made good practice against the ships, was soon defeated, and retired leaving 300 dead and all their camps and stores. The British troops were then sent upstroam and disem barked above the town. A few of the Scinde Horse, who were able to land, followed up the enemy. The local population, being Arabs, wore more inclined to be friendly to the British than to the Persians. On March 28th, 300 men with 6 howitzers loft Muhammareh in 3 steamers to destroy the enemy s magazines at Ahwaz. On April 1st the S162(W)GSB 1 ’ Previous Ex pedition, 1S57.howitzers shelled the enemy, who were found 8,000 strong on the right bank opposite Ahwaz, while the rest of the force entered Ahwaz, which was held by only 500 Persians. The enemy, being worn out, and half-starved owing to their hasty retreat, offered no resistance. On April 3rd the small force started back, and arrived at Muhammareh the same day. The force withdrew from Muhammareh on May 16th s3 CHAPTER II. Geography. Mesopotamia as a whole is the lowland portion of Qeneral * the basin of the ancient Asiatic rivers Euphrates and Tigris, in contradistinction to the Armenian and Kurdistan hill country, which forms the high-lying portion of the basin. The dividing line between the two is found in the neighbourhood of Diarbekr. Mesopotamia itself can again be sub divided into Upper and Lower Mesopotamia, the former, El Jezireh (or the island) between the 2 rivers extending south as far as Baghdad, and the latter, Irak-i-Ardbi, continuing to the Persian Gulf. On the north is Upper Mesopotamia, on the south the Persian Gulf. The eastern boundary is the Turco-Persian frontier, which is now being demarcated. The approximate line, emerging from the watershed of a belt of high mountains east of Baghdad, runs along the foothills about 40 miles east of the Tigris to a little north of Muhammareh, above which town it joins the Shatt-el-Arab which is thence the boundary (see page 59). As regards the country on the west, we have the Arabian tableland, rising very gradually from the lowland Euphrates country, and without any of the definite line of demarcation between the authority of the Turkish Government and the spheres of the various independent or semi-independent Arab tribes and chieftains. Physical features .—Between this western desert tableland, rising to 1,000 feet at about 100miles from the Euphrates, and the Persian hills on the east, nowhere is the country more than 100 feet above sea-level, and the whole Mesopotamian zone may be regarded as a northern extension of the Persian Gulf, which at one time probably reached almost to the Mediterranean. The country has in fact gradually been filled in by the alluvial silt of the great rivers and the advancing sands of the desert, and owing to this geological origin, the soil is found everywhere to consist of a sandy clay, abounding in excellent agricultural proper ties and only incapable of cultivation where water fails. Its astounding fertility is sufficiently shown bv the fact that it still remains unexhausted, after having supported the teeming population of the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian empires, and that Sir ’William Willcocks is of opinion that, if a proper system of irrigation control is once more put into force, the country can have in front of it a future of prosperity equal to that which it enjoyed in ancient days. At the present time, owing to the want of suitable control over the water and to the inertia of the inha bitants, the land so favourable for agriculture is little cultivated, and the population relies mainly on the produce of their flocks and herds, for which there is good grazing in spring, even in the so-called desert country. The main features of the region are naturally the two rivers Euphrates and Tigris, which, together with their valleys, will be alluded to in detail later.« These rivers approach fairly close to one another at Baghdad, and then turn apart to unite finally below Qurneh (Kuma), where the combined stream takes the name of the Shatt-el-Arab. Between Bcghdad and Qurneh the main streams are connect ed by several channels and intermittent water courses, of which the chief are the Nahr ’Isa or Sekla- wieh Canal and the Shatt-el-Hai. Around Qurneh and between Amarah and that place there are ex tensive marshes, but below Qurneh the Shatt-el- Arab traverses a flat and fertile plain, dotted over with villages, and covered with artificially-irrigated meadow lands and date groves. At Muhamma- reh (Persian territory), 40 miles above its mouth and 20 miles below Basrah, the Shatt-el-Arab is joined by the Karun from Persia, and here pro perly begins the delta, of which only one arm is navigable. For six months in the year this delta is converted into a swampy district, through the melting of the snows about the head-streams in spring and occasionally by the action of the autumn rains. From its mouth to Baghdad the main stream (Shatt-el-Arab and Tigris) is navigable throughout the year for steamers of some size (3-4 feet daught). The area from the Persian Gulf to Qurneh may be divided into :— (a) The eastern or left bank (from south towards Basrah)— (i) Abbadan island. Mostly desert, but the margins adjoining the rivers are culti-*&gt;* West Bank of Shatt-al-Arab. vated. There are many creeks and some marshes^ and island is not suit- able for the movement of troops. The refining works of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are on the island, facing the Shatt-el-Arab, about 8 miles below Muhammareh. (ii) Part of the Muhammareh district; and part of the Basrah Qaza. The margin of the river is covered by a practically continuous line of date-groves, having a depth inland of from J to 2 miles. East of the date-groves is a flat low-lying alluvial plain, usually called desert, but it is fairly well watered, and consists to a great extent of grass or cultivable land. Infantry could march from Muham mareh to a point opposite Basrah, by keeping 2 or 3 miles inland from the bank of the Shatt-el-Arab. The Shatt-al- Arab would then have to be crossed to reach Basrah. Two streams and several muddy creeks would have to be crossed. (c) The right or western hank of the river .—The margin of the river is covered by a practi cally continuous line of date-groves, having a depth inland of from | to 2 miles. There are some deep muddy creeks, some of which extend inland for a considerable distance from the river Shatt-el-Arab. There is a ten-foot tide in the lower Shatt-el-Arab, which fills these creeks and prob ably any inland marshes, but exact infor mation regarding these marshes is not available. West of the date-groves, the country is partly open desert and partly marshy as far as the Khur Zubair, an arm of the sea which runs up from Warbah island, northwards, and nearly parallel to the Shatt-el-Arab, at a distance of 25 to 30 miles from it. The country between the river Shatt-el-Arab and the Khur Zubair is believed to be not very suitable for the movement of troops, except along one good track, which runs along the edge of the desert, immediately behind the fringe of date-groves. See Communications. Much of this Peninsula (on which Fao stands) is the private property of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhammareh, though it is Turkish Territory. West of the Khur Zubair again there is open desert, the going ever which is reported to be firm and good. The northern part of the Khur is- surrounded partly by a marshy plain, much intersected by creeks, and partly by an alluvial plain which is liable to inundation. (d) North of Bzsrah, up to and beyond Qurneh, nearly the whole country is marshy, liable to inundation, and quite unsuitable for the movement of troops. There are, however* several tracks through these shallow marsh-8 es, by which local Arabs, on foot and lightly equipped, could find their way down to Basiah, unaccompanied by transport and impediments. The Shatt-el-Arab. General .-The Shatt-el-Arab is the river formed by the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates above Basrah, and flowing into the Persian Gulf at its north-western extremity. From the mouth to a point about two miles above Muhammareh it forms the Turco-Persian boundary, though the waterway is Turkish. It is a fine liver, IJ miles v ide at the mouth, and navigable as far as Basrah by any vessels that can cross the bar at the entrance (22 feet draught). The l0W 0n both sides of the entrance, but differs much in appearance, that on the west ern or Turkish side being fertile and thickly cover ed with date trees, that on the Persian side beum on the other hand comparatively bare and barren tor several miles up the river. There are two channels leading into the river entrance, the eastern or Khor-el-Amaya, and the western Khor-el-Kafka. The latter is the principal c annel, and is the one used by steam vessels; ), 1 ' uri3 in between two large banks and across broad fiats, which form the bar. There is an available depth at low tide of 13 feet and vessels drawing 21 and 22 feet can enter at high tide. The report does not distinguish between9 spring and neap tides, nor is it clear whether the extra available amount of water is not partly calculated from the practicability of vessels forcing their way through the mud or silt. Highest tides are night tides in winter and day tides in summer. Possibly by a moderate outlay of money the bar could be dredged so as to admit of the passage of vessels drawing up 25 or 26 feet. The tide is felt up to Qurneh and the rise and fall is from 9-10 feet. Fao.—The bar is about 2 miles from Ras-el- Bisha, the western-most point of the entrance, and 3J miles above Ras-el-Bisha is Fao, a village of about 400 inhabitants, and the terminal station of the Turkish land telegraph line, connecting with the British cable (Indo-European) to Bushire and India. Fao has a Turkish custom-house and quaran tine-station; also a rough stone landing jetty, with deep water a few yards from the outer end. There is a fort at Fao with a small Turkish gar rison. See under Military. A small creek runs at right angles to the river from 100 to 300 feet in rear of the gorge, beyond which are date plantations which, together with some reclaimed ground south-west and south of the fort, may be inundated at spring tides. The land on the eastern bank as far as Muham- mareh is known as Abbadan island, being separatedfrom the mainaland by he Bahmanshir river, which runs from the Karun rver at Muhammareh into the Gulf east of Shatt-el-Arab. Fao to Kabda Point .—Kabda Point is the long rounded point on the west bank opposite to and about 2J miles above Chellali Point. Previous to reaching this, Maamie village is passed on the western bank, 7 miles above Fao, and further up Ad Dura ; on the eastern bank a boat creek runs off opposite Fao leading to the Bahimishir, and above this is the large date grove of Kasba (Qasabat). Shoal water extends from the eastern bank around Kabda Point. Kabda Point to Hafar channel (Karun River ).—- In this reach there is shoal water around the Dawasir islands, and some difficult navigation by Muhalla island. The latter is formed by a shallow boat channel leading from Bareim village to Harta village on the eastern bank. Near the village of Abbadan, opposite the upper Dawasir island on the eastern bank, the Bahmanshir bends into within a distance of 1J miles. On the western bank above El Khast point is the village of Seihar, with a custom-house ; from here on to the Hafar channel the country is open and devoid of plantations. From 400 to 1,600 yards to the south of the entrance of the Hafar channel, which leads to Muhammareh and the Karun river on the Persian11 side, the ship channel of the Shatt-el-Arab is obstructed by a bar, which occasionally, between February and June, affords a very low depth of water. Rafar channel to Basrah .—From abreast of this channel the navigation space of the river is ob structed by the low grassy Dabba island, 4J miles long, and occupying three-fourths of the river width. There are also several other islands, some of which, including Shamshamiyah Island, are Turkish territory; but the private property of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. Opposite the southern end of this island is the village of Mutawa, and thence for 18 miles up to Basrah there is deep water , from here date groves line both banks of the river. Bahmanshir River. —The Bahmanshir river ^ is reached from the Khor-el-Amaya, and forms, with the Shatt-el-Arab, the island of Abbadan, which extends to Muhammareh where the Bahmanshir joins the Karun river. It was formerly the main channel of the Karun. The Khor-el-Amaya channel is tortuous and shallow until near the Bahmanshir mouth, but vessels drawing 7 feet can enter the river at low water can navigate for 30 miles up: the least depth to be passed over being a soft mud bar with 8 feet of water, 10 miles from the mouth. Inside the bar the depths vary from 10 to 15 feet, and at 5 cables from the mouhth there is as much as 10 feet. The Bahmanshir river is about 50 miles12 *&gt;* in length from the entrance (10 miles above the bar,) to Muhammareh, or 35 miles in a straight line. Its width near the mouth is 000 to 800 yards, but in the northern half of the river in some places it is only 300 yards across. The banks near the mouth are sloping and of soft mud, covered with coarse grass above high water mark; a few miles further up the banks are harder and steeper. About 22 miles from the mouth, villages and date gardens commence, and line the banks almost all the way up to the junction with the Karun. . r ^ le nor fhern part of the river, for about 15 miles, is very shallow, some of the mud banks drying almost across the channel at low water; the • • M. steamer “Comet”, drawing 3 feet, grounded twice in 1899 in steaming up. , ^ arun River. The entrance to the Karun river from the Shatt-el-Arab is by the Hafar channel, 5 miles upstream. This channel for all practical purposes, forms the connecting link between the Karun and the Gulf. •T!l 8 ,l?/ v lgth of tho Hafar channel is 2 miles, width 400 yards, and depth 18 to 24 feet. From Muhammareh to Ahwaz, a distance of 117 miles, the Karun is navigable for vessels of 2i feet draught from August to November, and“ for v^sels of 4- 2 - to 5 feet draught when the river ism -*w I 13 To Ahwaz the width averages 400 yards, the channel being tortuous. The strength of the current varies from 2 to 5 knots, according to the season. Just below Ahwaz there are rapids for pi m iles ; here cargo is generally transported from steamers to others above the rapids by means of a tramway (horse), but Messrs. Lynch’s “ Shushan” can effect the passage of these rapids. As far as Ahwaz, the surrounding country is almost desert; the banks are fringed with light scrub, and behind them stretch extensive plains up to the foot of the hills beyond. Towns. The town of Basrah occupies an important posi- Bawah. tion as the trade-gate of Mesopotamia and as the port of transhipment from ocean-going steamers to the river boats and caravans of the interior. It is situated 67 miles from the sea on the right (south) bank of the Shatt-el-Arab. As a port it has disad vantages under present conditions, for although na vigation up the Shatt-el-Arab for ocean steamers is fairly easy, there are some shifting shoals and a mud-bar at the mouth limiting the draught of vessels which can ordinarily enter to 22 feet. The actual town itself lies 2 miles from the nyer &gt;n a narrow creek, the Nahr-el-Ashar, a ong w c i very fair carriage road runs. It stands m a large wea, once enclosed by a mud wall widi raisedfV ■at 14 towers at intervals, all of which are now demolished or out of repair. The remains of the wall en close an irregular rectangle, 4,300 by 2,200 yards, the buildings being at the south-west corner, and the rest of space filled with date gardens. There are several creeks on both banks used for drainage and irrigation. The Ashar Creek leads up to the town from slightly above the British Consulate. It is the chief means of communication from the river to the town. Baghalehs can go up at high tide ; at other times only shallow draught boats, and at dead low tide the creek is practically bare mud. Two subsidiary creeks lead from the river to the town, the Hendik and the Robat. The are both higher up stream than the Ashar. The latter is crossed by two wooden bridges, one near its mouth, the other in the town. The Hendik has one bridge half a mile from the river. The latter creek is crowded with baghalehs loading grain. Grain stores are to be found along its banks. Width of creeks is about 40 yards, and of the river 700 to 800 yards. Troops could be landed fanywhere on either bank. Ho special arrangements would be necessary. All the European houses are on the river bank, or a short distance up the Ashar Creek, while near the mouth of the creek are the small Turkish dockyard and arsenal, custom-house, Government Konak, British Consulate and Turkish Commodore’s house. The only places of importance on the left bank are the quarantine station and the Navalrv 15 Hospital, with a small landing-pier. Beyond is Gardilan, a collection of mud huts. The country surrounding Basrah is quite flat everywhere, and any military landing could easily he covered by the fire of ships stationed in the river. No suitable position offers for the defence of the town, but the deep muddy canals in the vicinity would greatly impede the movement of troops. From the river to the town there is only the one made road, running along the south bank of the Ashar Creek ; the other tracks are almost impass able in wet weather. Zubair .—This town, the site of old Basrah, stands in the desert 9 miles south-west of the modern Bas rah and forms the first stage on the route from Bas rah to Kuwait and Najd. Around the town, which is walled, the country is entirely barren except to the south-east, on which side a scattered series of lucerne and melon fields, hedged with tamarisks, extends to a distance of 3 miles ; this tract is called Dirhamie, and the drinikng water of the twon is supplied by its wells. A few miles to the north west of Zubair are a property and fortified dwelling- house belonging to the hereditary Shaikh of Zubair. There is in the town a large covered bazar, mostly of masony, and the dwelling-houses are either of sun-dried or of burnt brick, the latter being excavat ed in great quantities on the adjoining site of ancient Basrah. Juss or gypsum mortar is exported from Zubair, and sandals and rude saddlery are manufactured,16 but the carrying trade probably supports a larger number of the population than any other industry. The melons of Dirhamie have a high reputation. Zubairis a market town for the surrounding Bedouin tribes. It has a mudir and a few civil police, and there is also a small military detach ment of about 20 men under an officer. The ruins of old Basrah extend from the walls of Zubair for 3 miles along the road to modern Bas rah they consist of mounds of earth intermingled with fragments of yellow burnt brick, and they cover an area of several square miles. Two miles from Zubair, on the southern edge of the highroad, are the remains of one of the principal mosques of the ancient town; part of its northern minaret, faced with excellent yellow brick, is still erect. About a mile to the east of this old Jami’ is the tomb of Talhah who was slain along with Zubair in the Battle of the Camel, fought near this place in 656 A.D. These two monuments alone remain to testify to the great ness of the former city. Muhammareh .—This town is situated in Persian territory, on the north (right) bank of the Hafar channel, about one mile from the Shatt-al-Arab and 46 miles from the Persian Gulf by that river. Muhammareh consists of about 800 houses, some of brick and some of mud, and is built on alluvial soil, chiefly along the river bank, where erosion ia prevented by revetments of date logs. The town iaenclosed above and below by date plantations about J mile deep, and behind the town is an open, treeless desert without any high ground within sight. Both banks of the Karun River are lined with a thick belt of date palms. The Shaikh of Muhammareh’s palace is about 4 miles up the Shatt-al-Arab just above Failieh, and stands on the water’s edge. It is protected in rear by a deep canal. Muhammareh is 4 days by steamer from Karachi. Climate. The climate of Mesopotamia may be classed as tropical, with an excessively hot summer, during which the plains become scorched and bare. The winters are short and mild, forming the plea santest part of the year. Com is sown about November and December and harvested in May or June. An autumn crop of maize, harvested about December, is often raised as well. The climates of Kuwait, Fao, Basrah, and Muhammareh are very similar. Kuwait appears to be the coolest, owing to the proximity of the sea and the sandy deserts. Basrah occasionally has frost at night in January. Si62(W)GSBThe following tahlegi ves an average range of temperatures (taken at Fao):—• Season. Months. Approximate range of temperature.

October and November both inclusive. 108° to 65° 102° to 70° 105° to 75° Rains. —'Rains may fall between the middle of 'November and the middle of March. Total appears to vary from 3 %'to II' at Fao ; at Basrah it is about 6'. There are occasional showers at all seasons. The wettest months are December, January and February. Winds .—During the first half of March and during July, north-west winds prevail with dry heat. From about the middle of July to the end of September the atmosphere is damp as well as hot: there is little wind from September to January. In September and October there are frequently fogs at night and in the early morning, especially near Fao. Health —Malarial fever in the autumn is the prin cipal disease of the country. Epidemics of cholera and plague occur. Other diseases in the towns aresmall-pox, diphtheria, typhoid, tuberculosis, and syphilis. The Baghdad boil is said to be practically unknown in Iraq outside Baghdad itself. Basrah is said to be less unhealthy than it used to be ; but it is malarious most of the year. Muham- mareh is insanitary. The winter is the most suitable time for military operations, any time between October and March. In 1857 the troops suffered much at Muham- mareh from myriads of flies by day, and from sand flies by night; but the heat was found to be less than at Bushire.—StY 20 CHAPTER III. Population. Inhabitants .—The bulk of the inhabitants consist of Arabs, either nomad Bedouins or, in the case of the populations of the towns and villages, sedentary Arabs; of the nomad tribes, the principal are the Muntafik, under Ajaimi bin Sa’dun Pasha, who lives at Suk-ush-Shuyukh, and the Bani-Lam, on the left bank of the Tigris towards the Persian hills. There are many subdivisions of these tribes and also nu merous other smaller tribes. The nomad bedouins, especially the Muntafik, are in constant conflict with Turkish rule and have hitherto supplied no soldiers to the Turkish army, in consequence of which the local units of Baghdad and Basrah are invariably considerably below the proper strength. The Turks proper form the official classes and the ruling element of the towns. Apart from the Arabs and Turks, there are certain numbers of Chaldeans and Sabceans, with some Persians and a good pro portion of Jews, mainly in Baghdad itself. The Chaldeans (a Christian race who claim to be des cended from the old Assyrian stock) are not en countered as a rule so far south as Baghdad, except when engaged on work on the river. They’provide the crews of the river steamers. The Saboeans another Christian sect numbering about 3,000 claim to be followers of John the Baptist, and ai’e mostly located around Amarah.The principal towns (with number of inhabitants chief Totths or houses shown in brackets), are:— Baghdad (145,000). Nasrie (10,000). Karbala (65,000). Basrah (60,000). Hillah (30,000). Nejef (12,000). Amara (10,000). Shatra (500 houses). Museyih (6,000). Qurneh (5,000). Kut-el-Amarah (4,000). Diwanie, Samawah, Ruhmetha (500 houses). Zubair (1,500). Basrah ,.—The population of Basrah including suburbs, numbers 60,000, mostly composed of sed entary Arabs. There are a few Turkish officials, some Europeans and Indians, about 3,000 Persians and 1,000 Jews. Zubair .—The population of Zubair is virtually all Sunni Muhammedan, as is natural in a place which holds the tomb of Zubair, arch-rebel against ‘Ali and killed here in fighting against him. Many notables and land-owners of the Basrah neighbour hood have country houses at Zubair, to which they retire in the hot weather in quest of a drier atmos phere 5 and some important families of Central Arabian origin are also located here. Muhammareh .—The population of Muhammareh amounts to 23,000, and that of the neighbouring town of Fallahieh (Arabistan) to 45,000. Arabistan is potentially one of the richest provinces of Persia,language. but the country lacks the population necessary to develop its great agricultural resources. The most generally spoken language is Arabic. The officials speak Turkish and some of them French in addition. Hindustani and English are little understood. Persian is spoken. Two old soldiers of native regiments, employed as watchmen by MacAndrew, Forbes and Company, might prove useful as interpreters. One or two of the Consulate Kavasses can also speak Urdu.23 CHAPTER IV. Resources. Water. Kuwait .—Passably good from wells, 4 south; but scarce at times. A better quahty is obtainable from wells at Qasr-us-Sirrah 8 miles, and Mishrif, 10 miles towards the south-east. TJmm Qasr .—There are three small wehs of brackish water in the Turkish fort about 8 feet deep. It is reported that there are other we “ with a plentiful supply ” about 250 yards to the north of the fort. The level of fresh water, which is only slightly brackish, is said to be only 8 feet below the surface. It would probably be advis able to arrange to supplement the water-supply from ships, for any body of troops exceeding wo battalions. Fao.—kt the Fao telegraph station there are seven tanks, each with a capacity of 400 ga ons. Drinking water is also obtained from the Sha al-Arab. Basrah .—Best water is from the open stream of the Shatt-al-Arab, but this is not very wholesome owing to drainage from swampy areas. The water from the Ashar canal is drunk by the poorer classes, but as they use the canal as wash-tuD, bath, dust-bin and cess-pool,” it had better be avoided.24 Norton tube wells would be useful at any camps away from the river, and their use was recommend ed after the 1857 expedition. Watering animals m the river is difficult, as the banks shelve and after the fall of the tide near Muhammareh a large extent of muddy bank is exposed. To obviate this difficulty pumps, with a length of pipe to run the water into troughs, should be taken. Muhammmeh .—At Muhammareh the water of the Karun river {i.e., the Hafar canal or Bahman- shir canal) is considered to be better than that of the bhatt-al-Arab, while both are better than the water of the irrigation canals which take off from the rivers. Wells at Muhammareh only contain r oo f 8 * 1 water ' . In , 1857 wat er tapped at a depth ol ZS feet, one mile inland, was also found to be brackish. Supplies. General .—There is comparatively little pro duction in this region generally. Dates form the mam article of export. The value of grain, barley and wheat exported in 1909 amounted to £ 600,000. The failure of the harvest is a factor alwavs to be reckoned with, both in Iraq and Arabistan. The average amount of wheat exported from Baghdad during 1907-8-9, was 15,000 tons. Corn is sown about November and December and harvested in May or June. An autumn crop of maize, harvested about December, is often raised as well.27 Supplies in Arabistan .—Wheat and barley are exported in large quantities from Arabistan, during the summer and autumn. Rice is imported to Muhammareh, where there are large stocks in the bazaar, from Hindian and Fallahieh. Dates are the staple food of the country. The districts affording the best supplies are the banks of the Karun river especially above Ahwaz, Shushtar, Dizful, Fallahieh, Hindian, and Ram- uz. These could provide sufficient grain for the needs of at least one division. Shushtar alone, which also has many water mills, could probably supply the needs of one division for several months. Ahwaz could probably support a brigade for a month. Mesopotamia could also provide large supplies of cereals. Sheep, goats and cattle are obfainable in North Aiabistan, but not so easily in Southern Arabistan. Between December and February sheep and goats are difficult to obtain. At Muhammareh there is only one large flour mill. Onions, beans and fish are procurable, and there is a good bazaar for native goods. Milk is scarce. Apples arc obtainable in May, melons and dates in August.The mule is more suitable than the camel in Arabistan, as water and fodder can be got daily, whilst camel grazing is apparently scarce. With at least one month’s notice and the inhabit ants friendly, the following transport might be collected Mules. Camels. Don Ramuz .. 200 keys. • • • » Shushtar and from Bakh- 300 1,000 tiaris.

Mules can be bought in Mesopotamia, where some 5,000 pack mules are in use. In 1857, 2,500 camels were bought in Basrah and 8,000 mules in Bagh dad. No bullocks are available in Arabistan. There is comparatively little production in this region generally. The date palm constitutes the principal feature in the landscape from Baghdad southwards, and dates form the main article of export. Opium has, however, of late years shown a considerable increase in production, and the same30 may be said of gum from the Persian hills, though the shrub producing this is failing on account of indiscriminate tapping. In 1909 wool was the biggest item of export after dates, but in previous years, and notwithstanding the fact that the most, is not made of the land in an agricultural sense, the value of the barley and wheat exported p mount ed to over £ 600,000, or one-third of the total ex ports. In 1909 the amount of these cereals was reduced to practically nothing on account of in adequate rainfall during the winter and tribal dis turbances. Other articles of export include carpets (mostly from Persia), liquorice and seeds, also an average yearly of 2,000 horses to Bombay. The total value of the export trade from Basrah in 1909 amounted to £1,504,000, of which about half came from Baghdad, and of which about 50 per cent, went to the British Empire. The value of the imports exceeds the value of the exports by £856,102, the principal items being cotton, silk and woollen goods, and sugar. Nearly the whole of the imports go to Baghdad, and somewhat over 50 per cent, come from the British Empire. As regards the carrying trade from the port of Basrah, the total tonnage of ships entering and leav ing the port amounted in 1909 to 393,491 tons, of which 356,729 was British and 12,728 Turkish.CHAPTER V Basrah.

There are also 11 frontier companies each no minally 100 strong which were raised in 1912 xiom a nucleus of regular troops and enhstments from local races. The three companies of Baghdad reached a strength of about 50 each, and were sent to garrison the posts near Khanikm, Mandah and Basrah. The companies from Musal (8 m number) have their headquarters at -r^f^h Sardasht, Baneh, Panjvm, Gulambar, Halabjah and Balavarieh. (Some of these places have since been handed back to Persia and the location of these companies is not known.)32 The following tables show the nominal and actual strengths of the Turkish troops in Mesopotamia.

(Note A.—In December 1913 there were said to be only 530 Turkish troops in and around Basrah. In May 1914, 330 more were sent to Basrah from Baghdad, and in March 1914, 800 of the 26th Regiment were sent by sea from Constantinople. 2,000 more were said to have arrived from Baghdad in August 1914. Allow ing for detachments, the total at Basrah is probably 3,000 (October). In March 1914 the Resident, Baghdad, reported that there were in the Vilayet of Baghdad only 2,075 men, 112 horses and 28 guns. Note B.—The number of troops including Reservists at Bagh* dad is now (October) probably 5,000. * (The 31st and 32nd Regiments were disbanded in AprJ 19.14, and the men (420) transferred to the Gendarmerie,)37 The Re-lif, or second reserve, has almost ceased to exist in Turkey since the Balkan War of 1913, Nominally the XIXth and XITIth Corps each have two Redif divisions, the nominal strength of which is 30,885 rifles. The numbers actually under arms at the depots are about 10 or 12 per regiment. The rifles are stored chiefly at Baghdad, Musal and Ruwanduz. The men have received very little training, and all arrange ments for supply, clothing, transport, would have to be improvise d. There is no cavalry and no artillery for these divisions. In 1912 the actual strengths were estimated at about 9 000 on the 4 divisions. The actual total strength of the two corps in Actual total, regular troops in October 1914 may be taken to be about as follows :— Baghdad Musal A. Corps. A. Cor Rifles 8,000 5,000 Sabres 300 850 Guns .. 58 58 Machine guns .. 6 • • To expand the regular (Nizaw) formations to war strength, the active reserve has been called out. This gives a grand total of (say) 15,000 men and 114 guns.Efficiency* Turkish rein forcements. ,, 38 The majority of the rank and file of the Xllth and XHIth Corps are Arabs, the remainder being Turks, Ana tolians from Asia Minor (both Musalman and Christian) and a few Kurds. None of the troops in Mesopotamia are well trained. The infantry are hardy and good natural soldiers. They are armed with Mauser rifles of two or three different patterns. The artillery is still mostly equipped with old pattern guns. The only Q. F. guns reported are one mountain battery of 4 guns at Baghdad and one of 4 guns at Musa! (July 1912). The cavalry regiments are not well mounted and are bandy a match for the local Arab mounted tribesmen. The Turkish IXth, Xth, and Xlth Army Corps are stationed at Erzerum, Ersinjan and Van respectively. Owing to the Russian menace on the Caucasian frontier, and the attitude of Kurds and Armenians, it is unlikely that any of these corps could be spread to assist in Mesopotamia. The Xth Army Corps at Ersinjan has three divisions, located, two at Ersinjan and one at Siwas. The other two corps only have two divisions each. Land defences. The fort is a square of 30 yards, having one entrance by a wooden door in the north face. Two diagonal corners project about three yards and give flanked fence; a salient on the west side also enfilades two faces. The walls are 15 feet 1hish and are loophole d at 4| feet from the ground, this teing their height as measured both inside and outside the fort. The diagonal corners have a second tier of loopholes 1 foot below the top of the wall for use by men lying on the roof of buildings inside, which* run nearly all the way round and furnish quarters for the garrison, store-rooms, etc. The loopholes have no splay. The walls are 2 to 3 feet thick, the lower eight feet being of unbaked brick, the upper part of mud with a coping of burnt brick. The gateway is also of burnt brick* There is a garrison of 1 officer and 30 men. There is, also, about 3| miles south-east of the telegraph station just above the bar an incomplete, stone, blunted rc dan, facing south-east, and com manding the bar and approaches. Garrison about 2 officers and 24 infantry (recently reinforced). Casemates ; wet ditch; 2 bastions ; gun embrasures ; caponier. It has been stated that there were 15 guns and ammunition in store underground, but in May 1912 the fort was still incomplete, with no guns, mounted. This is probably the position now, for, with the exception of a clear alley leaving down to the nearest part of the river, the fort is now (1914) entirely surrounded by a forest of date trees and is falling into disrepair. This fort would have to be taken before the river could be used as a line of advance.A loopholed serai, built of brick, close to the (gemiarmes^ tl0n * garrisoned b y 10 Zaptieb police Safwan.

Muhammareh, see page 42. lighting quahhesaf local Arabs of Mesopotamia. Of the tribes, the largest and most powerful is the Muntafik No estimate of the Muntafik is avail able but they had 1,500 men in rebellion against n f Tu /S &amp;t ° ne W - Shaikh Sa’dun, the late Knw-rt f he Mun , tafi \ colle cted, in 1910, against the . ^ foices ’ irom }lis own followers and other tribes, some 4,000 horsemen, and a large number of dismounted men (no numbers given), but no tmuls (ndmg camels). The Muntafik carry in war zf; zZr- Tbey are also armed liave - been in a State of almost constant rebellion agamst the Turkish Governmentfor at least ten years, and they would gladly get rid of the Turks. The Bani Lam Arab tribe is also usually in a state of hostility towards the Turks. They have recently (1914) had trouble with the Shaikh of Muhammareh. Ihe tribes in the Basrah Vilayat, generally, have probably as many rifles as they can afford to buy. The favomite pattern is the Martini, but there is also a sprinkling of Mausers. Where breech loaders are deficient, the favourite substitute is a double-barrelled muzzle-loading gun. Other weapons are swords, 12-foot lances with a for midable blade, curved daggers about a foot long, double-edged, and very sharp at the point. For several years the Arabs have been very friendly towards the British, and on several occasions prominent chiefs have come forward with suggestions of a British Protectorate, which the Resident at Baghdad found somewhat embarrass ing to deal with. The Arabs of Basrah and the neighbourhood, in 1913-14, only needed a leader and a little encouragement to rise against the Turkish adminis tration. In June 1913 the Turkish Commandant of Troops was actually murdered in Basrah by Arabs. Kuwait. The Kuwait unit of organization is the A khabra consists of 10 men with their arms and probably 100 rounds of ammunition each. Kuwait42 7 tlialuls or riding camels, with their equipment. Food for as many days as may be ordered. The expedition organized in 1910, against the Muntafik, may be taken as a guide towards the maximum probable strength of the Kuwait forces, viz. :— 600 Khabras .. .. 6,000 men with 4,200 thaluls. Unorganized Bedouins .. 6,000 Probably at the disposal of the Shaikh from more southern tribes .. 4,000 Probable maximum total 16,000 Many rifles, and much ammunition have reached Kuwait from Masqat, during 1911-14, and the followers of the Shaikh of Kuwait are well armed. The Shaikh of Kuwait would most probably assist us against the Turks. Muhammareh. In 1911-12 and again in 1912-13-the Shaikh collected a force of between 5,000 and 10,000 Arabs at Ahwaz, for possible operations against the Bakhtiari. This gives an indication of what he might raise to oppose the Turks and assist us. He has several maxim guns (for which he em ployed Europeans in 1913); but he has no Q. F. guns. His army is only a rabble, but the men are43 well armed, and would willingly fight against the Turks. They are very mobile. The Shaikh of Muhammareh, who stands to lose much if the Turks increase in power, would, if only from self-interest, be bound to throw in his lot with us. His influence is very great among the Arabs, not only on the Persian side, but also in Turkish Mesopotamia. We, on our part, are bound by assurances given, to protect the Shaikh of Muhammareh against Turkish aggression. The defences of Muhammareh are hardly worth considering, they consist of 5 miscellaneous brass pieces at the eastern end of the town overlooking the river, and a ruined mud wall on the landward side of the town. In 1859 the Persians had erected 4 well- constructed batteries on the mainland, and 5 on Abbadan Island opposite the town. These had case mates and embrasures. There are 11 old guns in front of the Shaikh’s palace at Failieh; but only two of these are fit even for salut ing purposes. Camming grounds. Muhammareh .—Unlimited space is available on either side of the Karun above the Bahmanshir chan nel, with good water from the Karun. A good camp site could be obtained on Abbadan Island. Connection with the mainland is, however, difficult, as it entails fording or ferrying across the Shatt-al-Arab or Bahmanshir canal. One object of c imping on Abadan Island would be to obtain the44 -V -V ■ 9 use of the Oil Company's jetty, for disembarking from ships and re-embarking on river steamers. There is also ample space available north or north- west of Muhammareh. Basrah, —Turkish troops are often camped on the side of Basrah furthest from the river, where the Zubair track leaves the town. This is above flood level. It would be 2 miles away from the river water-supply, but water could be obtained from an adjacent creek. The size of this ground is not known. There is room for a brigade to camp behind the naval hospital on the left bank opposite the Consulate. This is only 600 yards from the river. Behind this again about 400 yards further away from the river the space is unlimited. Half a batta lion could be encamped at the Customs House and •there is room for another half battalion on the opposite side of the Ashar Creek in the arsenal grounds. Umm Qasr. There is sufficient space at Umm !f r . i( f the c amp of at least one brigade. The soil is hard sand, with small tufts of grass. run45 CHAPTER YI. Maritime. Turkish naval strength. —The only' Turkish war- ship of any importance in the Shatt-al-Arab is the “ Marmaris ”, a gunboat of about 420 tons. She was completed in 1907, and is armed with four O-prs.j, two 1-prs., and a torpedo tube above water. f In April 1914 four patrol boats, one of wood and three of iron, of a gross tonnage of 30 to 33 tons each ? were landed at Basrah by the SS. u Sistan They were made by Thorneycroft and Co., and fitted with two paraffin oil motors of 140 horse power. Bach boat carried two 37 m. m. guns, and cost about £45,000. 4,000,000 rounds of common point fuse shell, Mark II, fused for the 37 m. m. guns were also sent. Other vessels of various types are to be found in the Shatt-al-Arab in various stages of disrepair. These are as follows :— {i) “ Baghdadi ”, converted cargo steamer. Draught 3J feet, one gun, 8 knots speed. Carries 81 to 100 men. Used to transport troops between the various ports on the ^ banks of the river. (ii) “ Alous ”, draught 3J feet. Two guns. Carries 60 to 80 men .Speed 6 knots. Used to overawe the Arabs and collect subsidies. (in) “ Kilid-el-Bahr ”, an ancient gunboat, per manently located at Basrah. Four guns.46 / (tv) and (w) “ Frat n and “ Resafa n steamers protected with iron plates probably against attack by the Muntafik on the river. To carry two ordinary guns and two machine guns. (vi) and (vii) “ Brinji ” and “ Ikinji launches, to be armed with 2 Q. F. guns. (1910). No information has been received that this has been done. Landing Facilities. Basrah. Anchorage .—Basrah is 67 miles from the sea. Anchorage for steamers in mid-stream. Not room for more than 2 abreast, but any number can lie up and down the river Shatt-al-Arab, which is here 600 yards wide. Landing .—The country around Basrah is quite ^t everywhere. Any military landing could easily be covered by the fire of ships stationed in the river. The deep muddy creeks in the vicinity would, however, greatly impede the movement of troops. Troops could land anywhere on either bank of the river, without special arrangements being made. From the river to the main quarter of the town, 2 miles, there is only one made road, along the’ southern bank of the Ashar creek. The other tracks are almost impassable in wet weather. Wharves. The office and yard of Gray, Mackenzie and Company is situated close to the mouth47 of the Ashar Creek on the south side. There is a wharf on the river front, made of brick, 80 yards long. There is a shed close to the wharf, 50 yards long by 10 yards wide, with open sides and a tiled roof. Height of wharf above water at high tide is about 2 feet. Stores could be landed here. There are no other wharves. They could be easily constructed of date-logs of which there is an abun dant supply. River front of Lynch and Company s premises is about 150 yards. There are no sheds. Goods are stored everywhere under tarpaulins. Horses are shipped from lighters. About half a mile south of the Ashar Creek there is another yard with a shed about 60 yards by 15 yards witn open sides and matting roof. There are no cranee, winches or carts. There are no store depots. Besides the sheds noted above, the bottom storeys of the European houses along the river front could be utilized. These houses are two-storied and of brick. There is no stone in the country. Local craft .—Lynch and Company have three steamers and Turkish Company eight steamers for service between Baghdad and Basrah. As regards other craft, there are no tugs, but there are four steam lighters employed in taking cargo to ships across the bar at Fao. Ocean going steamers take half cargoes at Basrah, cross the bar and fill up from these lighters outside. These four lighters belong to Bucknall Steam Navigation Company.48 Striek Steam Navigation Company. West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company. Bombay-Persian Steam Navigation Company. Another has been ordered by a Parsee firm. Gray, Mackenzie and Company have one launch and Strick and Company have another. Three or four others have been seen, but are apparently not in use. There is a dredger lying on the mud on the left bank opposite the Consulate, but apparently it has never been used. The types of boats are :— (i) A light keel-less boat called a battam, 35 to 40 feet long and 30 inches broad, drawing about 6 inches of water. Capacity, 15 men fully equipped. They are used as punts along the bank, but are towed across the river. Crew two men, who always prefer poling to rowing. (n )Lighters for cargo. Capacity, 20 to 30 tons. Native built. Ample supply. (in) Native built baghalehs of all sizes. Ample supply. Lynch and Company have engineering works and a dock for their river steamers under the charge of an English engineer at Magil, about six miles up the right bank of the river.Shipping lines and agents .—The following lines Of steamers call regularly at Basrah :— The British India Steam Navigation Com pany, running weekly with Gulf mails from Karachi and Bombay. The Bombay and Persian Steam Navigation Company, every fortnight from Bombay. The Anglo-Arabian and Persian Steamship Company, direct from England. Bucknal Brothers direct from England. The West Hartlepool Steamship Company, direct from England. The Hamburg-America Line, monthly from Hamburg and Antwerp. A Russian subsidised steamer calls three or four times a year, and an occasional Austrian-Lloyd. For the date season numerous steamers are chartered. The European firms with offices at Basrah are (») Lynch and Company Employed in tie carrying trade up Tigris and Karun rivers. (t») Gray, Mackenzie and Company Shipping Agents.

It cannot be used if the Karun be in flood. (6) Outer Anchorage. Between the entrance to the Haffar canal and the west of Dabba island. There are moorings for 27 Steamers in single file. B. I. boats usually anchor here. Communication to the shore is by means of ballams, baghalehs, lighters and barges, of which the follow ing are available, in addition to 5 tugs, one of which is suitable for heavy towing. Following launches are also available :— Persian Oil Company Shaikh of Muhammareh Customs British Consul * * 1 2 1 1The Shaikh of Muhammareh also has a steam yacht. Name. Capacity.

A supply of 30 feet planks is necessary. Date palm logs are available for building piers, etc., and barges might be used as pontoons. Landing is muddy work, but not diffi cult except for animals. Landing should not be attempted during strong ebb tides. The rise of tide is 6—9 feet. The following wharves would be useful for landing stores, etc. Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s jetty on Abbadan Island at which steamers drawing 25 feet can berth.

There is no anchorage other than the Shatt-el-Arab suitable for effecting a landing near Fao. Landing .—At high tide landing by 'boats is not difficult at many places along the bank of the Shatt- el-Arab, and one or more of the numerous creeks might a Jso be utilised. At low tide banks of mud are uncovered varying from 20 to 100 yards in breadth, and disembarkation would be difficult. Near the fort there is a small pier for landing material. At the civil station of Fao, which is about 4 miles above the fort, there is a rough stone jetty with water deep enough at the end of it for native dhows or ship’s boats. In case troops had to land over mud or were ob liged to cross any creeks after landing, it would be advisable to have a supply of 20'' planks or other bridging material. Date palms might be utilized, Umm Qasr. The approach to Umm Qasr. This place lies at the head of a rectangular opening of the coast line, the space so formed being occupied by Bubiyan Island, with the Khur Abdullah and Khur Sabiya inlets leading round the island to Umm Qasr. Just in front of Umm Qasr is the smaller island of Warbah,56 Khar Abdullah. The Khur Abdullah is 13 miles wide at its entrance by Ras-al-Geit, 17J miles long up to Warbah island and 8 miles further on to Umm Qasr. The channel to follow to reach Umm Qasr lies north of Warbah island, between this and the mainland. Great care is necessary to avoid a sandbank extending eastward from Warba&gt;h island. There is a bar at the oast end of Warbah island between the Khur Abdullah and the KLur She tana ; depth at low water 3J fathoms. Naviga tion is not simple for a ship of any size. As far as it goes the channel is deep, but a ship could not count on more than 21 feet of water at low tide. At high tide the breadth of water is three times what it is at low water. Consequently a ship is liable at high water to get out of the channel and take the ground. Vessels should be navigated between the time of low water and half tide. The whole of the land on the north side of the Khur ’Abdullah is covered for some miles, at hUh water springs: Warbah island is practically all cover ed at high water. Anchorage may be taken up anywhere in the - channel but there is a well-sheltered and deep anchorage between Warbah and the mainland as Umm Qasr is approached. Both shores of the Khur Abdullah are of a very low alluvial land, covered in places with reeds57 and grass and with shallow flats, extending a long way out on both sides, more particularly from the northern shore. Umm Qasr Greek and Khur Zubair .—Umm Qasr is the name of a small creek at the head of the Khur Abdullah on the west bank of which the Turks have constructed a small fort. North of Warbah Island the Khur Abdullah and the Khur Sabya unite, form ing the Khur Zubair, from which the Umm Qasr creek branches off to the west about 4 miles above the junction. The Khur Zubair is about f mile wide, and contains deep water opposite Umm Qasr and for 14 miles inland. At this point it divides into two branches, one running north-east with a depth of 18 feet to within 12 miles of the Shatt- al-Arab, the other much shallower and narrower going further west to within 10 miles of Basrah and Zubair. Although the depths of the channel in the Khur Zubair are usually good, the navigation is not easy. The head waters of the Khur Zubair are surround ed by muddy swamps. It is evident that ther e are no good landing places in these swamps, as ther e is no local boat traffic. The Umm Qasr creek itself is about 3 miles long and | mile broad, with a depth of water generally of only 3 to 4 feet. The fort is situated J mile in land, but the usual landing place is at the entrance of the creek.Anchorage .—There is good anchorage in 10 fathoms \ mile from the shore, at as pot 2 miles south- south-east of the fort. Abreast of the fort there is only 3 to 4 feet of water at high tide. The anchorage may be considered sheltered as, although the country around is low-lying, the anchorage is practically a land-locked area | mile square. Ten vessels, such as H. M. S. “ Sphinx ,J or such as the British India Company’s ships usually employed in the Persian Gulf, could anchor in it in any for mation considered desirable. There is good holding ground, a sandy muddy bottom. There is no strong sweep of tide or cur rent and there are no dangers in the anchorage basin. Boats could not get shelter from hostile fire, but ships’ guns would command the whole country around, it being flat and open. Landing .—The shore opposite the anchorage is fairly steep and not swampy, there being a good, dry bank of firm, gravelly soil, 20 feet above high water level, and only 200 yards from high water mark. The distance between high and low water marks at this point is very small. There is no marshy ground on the foreshore here. Above high water mark the beach is practically unlimited inland. There are no obstacles to the movements of troops. Horses or mules would have to swim ashore unless flats and a jetty were used. A landing jetty could be made, there being good holding for piles, but no materials are available locally.There are no boats to be had locally, but plenty could be got from Kuwait, which in 1904 had 461 pearl boats, 30 sea-going cargo vessels and 50 coasting vessels. The pearling boats are suitable for disembarking horses. Steam and motor launches could be used. The country around is flat and open and Jabal Sanam, 8 miles north-west of Umm Qasr, would be a good situation for a visual signalling station to communicate with Umm Qasr and Basrah.CHAPTER VII. Administration. General. —For purposes of government the locality is divided into two vilayets, those of Baghdad and Basrah. &gt; In the Turkish system of administration, terri tory is divided into vilayets, these being again divided into sanjaqs, the sanjaqs into Jcazas, and the Jcazas into nahiyehs. At the head of the vilayet is the vali (either a mili tary man or a civilian, or both combined), at the head of a sanjaq is a mutassarif, at the head of a kaza a kaimmakam, and at the head of a nahiyeh a mudir. The vilayet of Baghdad is divided into three san jaqs, Baghdad, Diwanie and Karbala. South of a line through Kut-el-Amarah and Samawah com mences the Basrah vilayet, divided into four san jaqs, i.e., Basrah Muntafik, Amarah and El Hasa. There is no definite line west between the limits of the Basrah vilayet and the independent tribes of the Arabian tableland ; and the El Hasa district on the western shores of the Persian Gulf is separated from the remainder of the Basrah vilayet by the territory of the Shaikh of Kuwait. The population of the whole of the Baghdad and Basrah vilayets is estimated at an approximate num ber of 1,047,000, or about 9 or 10 to the square mile.The Basrah Vilayet .—The vilayet is administered by a vali (Lieutenant-Governor), headquarters at Basrah. The Basrah vilayet comprises the sanjaks of Basrah and Muntafik. Each sanjak is adminis tered by a Mutassarif (Commissioner), and is divid ed into kazas as follows :— Basrah sanjaq. Muntafik sanjaq.

Arabistan .—Persian territory meets the Shatt- el-Arab nahiyeh of the Basrah kaza on the left bank of the river Shatt-el-Arab. This part of the Turco-Persian border was demarcated earlyUvl ;-t ,• . •'; wmst r •• •• i; Aii ■ ! ■] h 62 in 1914, and the boundary follows the Shatt-el* Arab as far as the upper entrance of the Di’aiji creek, miles by river above the mouth of the Karun, the island of Umm-ul-Khasif and Sham- shamiyah being upon the Turkish side, and thenco leaves the bank of the river Shatt-el-Arab in a north-westerly direction towards Hawizeh. This portion of Persian territory belongs to Southern Arabistan, and is governed severely, but ably, by the Shaikh of Muhammareh. The me dium of communication between the Shaikh and his people is through qilids or headmen. The hereditary Shaikh of Muhammareh is a per- sonage of some importance, as he is the ruler over the whole of the southern portion of the Persian province of Arabistan, and, though nominally subject to the Government of Tehran, he is in great measure independent of the Persian Central author ity. Thus, although he pays a certain tribute in return for the freedom of administrative rights, and while there is a Persian Customs official at Muhammareh, the latter is only there by agreement with the Shaikh. The Shaikh enjoys such political freedom as to permit of his entering into relations with the British Government, who have given him certain assurances of protection. As regards relations w’ith Persia, in addition to the Customs officials at Muhammareh, Ma’ashur, and Hindian, the post and telegraph offices are also Persian; there is a Persian Foreign Office repre sentative at Muhammareh, but the latter in practice tis peldom referred to, the foreign Consuls dealing with the Shaikh direct. Kuwait .—The northern boundary at the pre sent time may be taken to be a line running from Khur-us-Sabiyah immedaitely south of the Turkish posts at Umm Qasr and Safwan, to Jabal Sanam, and thence to the Batin. The southern boundary takes off from the coast opposite Jabal Manifa and runs inland towards the west. The Turks have agreed to regard Kuwait as an autonomous province under Turkish suzerainty, and the Shaikh as a Turkish Kaimmaham. They recognised (1914) that the Shaikh had bound him self by certain agreements with us. The rule of the Shaikh of Kuwait (Shaikh Muba rak) within his principality, is despotic, personal and absolute. The heads of his departments are mostly slaves. There is no delegation of authority. Foreign interests .—The British Government is represented in Arabistan by a Consul, residing at Muhammareh, under the authority of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and by a Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, who receives orders either from the Minis ter at Tehran or from the Political Resident of the Indian Government at Bushire. The only other European Power represented in Southern Arabistan is Russia. At Basrah His Majesty’s Government is repre sented by a Consul and at Baghdad by a Consul- General, who is also Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. Germany has a Consul at Basrah.*0&gt; 2* 64 Coinage, Weights, and Measures. Gold coinage.— 2-|, 1, \ and l lira pieces, cf which the 1 and ^ lira are most seen.

The principal means of communication between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf, through Basrah is the river Tigris and its continuation the Shatt-al-Arab. Certain road communications exist, but, especially around Basrah, the numerous water-channeis and Swamps limit the means of transit by land very considerably. The Euphrates is navigable to a certain extent, but is not generally used for purposes of traffic, and in its present condition it is not suitable for military movement of troops except in a subsidiary sense. Existing information relating to the road communications is imperfect, and requires to be supplemented very considerably, but a main con nection with Basrah is to be found through Hillah, Diwanie-Samawah-Sukhesh-Shayukh and along the desert edge ; this is probably suitable for wheeled traffic the whole way, but in any case^ carts can go from Baghdad to Hillah and from Hasrieh co Basrah. A carriage road connects Baghdad with iCarbala and Najaf, and it is probable that the previously mentioned road can also be reached fairly easily at Samawah from Najaf. Turning to the Tigris side there is a well-used caravan route from Baghdad to Kut-el-Amarah and Amarah, but there is little road communication south of Amarah as the riv ei marshes then commence. Across the Persian border there are caravan routes from Amarah, K.ut-el-Amarah, and Baghdad* S. 162{W(G.S.R GeneralTo Basrah there are caravan routes from Zubair, Umm Qasr and Kuwait, as well as further west wards into Arabia, and the country generally is open and passable for carts. Wheeled transport is little employed in the whole of Muhammareh, camels being principally used, with donkeys for short journeys and mules in the hilly country to the east. Lines oe Advance. To reach Basrah, the following are the possi ble routes:— • A. By river to Basrah. (The easiest and quickest route.) See Chapter 1, Shatt-af- Arab). B. Disembark at Fao, thence along the edge of the desert parallel to the Shatt-al-Arab. C. Disembark at Muhammareh, thence by land, see Chapter I. Eastern bank of Shatt-al-Arab). D. Disembark at Umm Qasr, thence by land. E. Disembark at or near Kuwait, thence by land. Roads. From Fao there is a track through the date plantations from hamlet to hamlet, but this is very devious, and many creeks are crossed by bridges of a single date palm trunk. There is also a good track, 67 miles in 4 stages, which follows the edge of the desert west of the fringe67 of date groves, and keeps parallel to, and about 2 or 3 miles from, the river Shatt-al-Arab. Sometimes, especially after rain, the going is soft and muddy in places, and the route in the first stage is then confined to the top of an artificial dam. This route is passable for infantry and cavalry and, with slight improvements near Fao, for field artillery (vide, Appendix C, Route I). Resources. —Water, fuel and fodder are obtainable in sufficient quantities for a brigade. Supplies are scarce till Basrah is reached, except dates.70 From UMM QASR to BASRAH. 45 miles. 3 stages. Authorities .—Military Report on the Region between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf, 1911. Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908. Epitome. General Description .—This route is passable for pack transport and also for wheeled traffic, though the latter would find the whole route very difficult in wet weather, and impassable in stage 3 when the country is under water, as happens when the Euphrates comes down in flood. This begins during March, the river generally being at its high est during April. The route consists of an un metalled road across the plain, and, though good enough going in dry weather gets very heavy if there is any water about. Next to the river rout© this is the shortest and best way to Basrah. Water. —Plentiful. Fuel and Fodder .—Scarce at stages 1 and 2, but plentiful at stage 3. Supplies .—Only obtainable at Basrah. Live stock is to be had in considerable numbers at stage 3, but there is practically none elsewhere.71 No. of stage and total dis tance . Details.

General direction north-west. The route runs over un- JL tJ XU. ^ dulating barren and stony ground. This stage is passable for all arms, and is above the flood level. At mile 8J, two hillocks are passed. At mile 15, Safwan ; see route No. 18, Kuwait- Easrah, which is here joined. *!Note.— This route may be shortened by going to Rafldhlyah direct instead of via Safwan. In that case a north-north westerly direction would be taken on leaving Umm Qa , Rafldhiyah being reached at mile 2. The intervening c °nntry is a sandy, gravelly plain, dry, not swampy, but sometimes flooded in places by the overflow of the Euphrates. There are desert bushes and camel-grazing along this variant, but no tamarisks. tsKmmsmmm.2 EAFIDHIYAH 14 m. General direction — slightly east of north. 31 m. The route runs over flat, barren, stony ground, passable for all ai’ms. It skirts the swamps at the head of Khor Zubair, and is above the ordinary flood level. At mile 14, Rafidhiyah, a country residence of the Naqlb of Basrah ; it is a quadrangular en closure with bastions at the north and south ancles. Water is abundant from 3 wells, 12 feet deep. There are a few trees There are more wells, and some cultivation, on the north-east side of Radhiyah. 3 BASRAH .. 16 m. General direction north-east by east. 45 The route at first runs north over a plain with a very slight ascent. The soil is gravelly. There is fair camel-grazing and occasional houses with irrigated gardens. The whole of the country between Rafidhiyah and mile 6 is plentifully supplied with water from wells 5 to 6 feet deep ; they are especially numerous about mile 4. From mile 3 to 6 there is scattered culti vation of rice, maize, lucerne, and dates, the plots being surrounded by tamarisk growth. This tract is called Birhamiyah, and the population is about 6,000. There are large numbers of buffaloes cows and sheen. Jl At mile 8, site of old Basrah ; and 3 miles off the track in a direction south-west by west, is Zubair, a well-built town situated on slightly elevated73 ground with a ridge of broken ground to the north west, north and north-east. Small quantities of supplies, a bazar, no fodder, 4 or 5 wells of good water. In the time of the Euphrates flood a water channel, which approaches the northern end of the town of Zubair, from the direction of Basrah, con tains 2 feet of water. The route turns north-east. It then crosses an open barren plain. The soil is light brown, hard, and dusty ; it is free from stones. From mile 6 to mile 10 the route runs in a depression, which is liable to be submerged by the Euphrates in high water season, to a depth of 2 to 3 feet. At mile 11 the date groves and gardens of Basrah commence. At mile 12, the road enters the town across a small bridge after which it passes under a built over tunnel of houses, known as the Bab-al-Kuwait. Thence it emerges into the bazars. The route for wheeled traffic goes through the city and bazar to reach the landing places on the river Shatt-al- ’Arab. Animals can make their way through by various paths, as the irrigation channels are bridged for foot-passengers only. Between Zubair and Basrah there is a good, open road, but it is unmetalled. At mile 16 Basrah (British Consulate), a town scattered about in vast date groves with a popu lation of about 58,000. The water-supply is fromthe river Shatt-ah’Arab. There is a large bazar and some shops dealing in European goods. There are large numbers of cattle and sheep, which graze along the river bank. Dates and rice are extensive ly cultivated. There is plenty of garden produce. There is a British and a Turkish Post Office, and a Turkish Telegraph Office. Arrangements can easily be made for river transport. There are the river companies’ steamers, and large numbers native boats, of 30 tons and under. Considerable supplies of coal are stored in Basrah, for the river steamers, the average stock of Messrs. Grey, Mackenzie and Co. being about 800 tons. Kuwait to Basrah. There is no particular object in landing at Kuwait in order to reach Basrah. The circuitous nature of the land route and the lack of water along it, also, renders it inadvisable to use it. Some information regarding the route is, how ever, given in the following table.78 77 *■ Telegraphs. The Indo-European Telegraph Department’s cable (British) from India, via Bushire, is landed at Fao, where there is a combined Anglo-Turkish telegraph office, British operators being in charge of the cable terminus. A Turkish land line, along the right (western) bank of theShatt-al-Arab, goes from Fao to Basrah, and thence along the bank of the river Tigris to Baghdad. Another line, branching off at Qurneh, follows the Euphrates Valley, via Hiliah, to Baghdad. From Baghdad the land line continues, via Musal, to Constantinople. A Persian Government land line goes from Muhammareh to Ahwaz, and from Ahwaz, via Behbehan and Borazjun, to Bushire. A line with two wires runs from Baghdad north to Mosul, and from Baghdad to Kirmanshah and Tehran a line follows the main route through Bakuba, Khanikin and Karind, having two wires on wooden poles. Telephones. There is an overhead telephone from Maidan-i- Naftun to Abbadan island, with a branch to Muhammareh, belonging to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This runs along the pipe line on the left (eastern) bank of the Karun river. The Shaikh’s palace at Failieh is connected by tele phone with Muhammareh.79 APPENDIX A. Note on Qatar Peninsula and Dohah. The Qatar peninsula, to the east of the island of Bahrein, is ruled by Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim, a rich and powerful chief, who has a following of about 2,000 fighting men. Some few years ago his father was engaged in hostilities with the Turks, who succeeded, after some hard fighting, in establish ing a garrison in the fort of El Bida (Dohah) on the eastern side of the peninsula, and in reducing Jasim to nominal subjection. He is now styled qaim- maqam of the peninsula under the Porte, and flies the Turkish flag, but he dislikes his rulers and would be glad to be rid of them. The Bani Hajar tribes can muster about 4,500 fighting men, which, with the Shaikh’s 2,000, would give altogether 6,500 ; but 4,500 represents as large a force as he is ever likely to bring together. Since about 1900 various attempts have been made by the Porte to assert its sovereignty in other parts of the Qatar peninsula, and in 1910 Turkish mudirs were to be despatched to Zobara, Odaid, Wakra, and Abu ’Ali Island. His Majesty’s Government, however, protested against this, and, indeed, have never acknowledged Turkish rule in El Qatar. In 1913 Turkey consented to remove her garri son from Qatar; but that agreement has not yet been signed, hence the garrison remains.

Shaikh Khazal Khan, K.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., of Muhammareh (Sardar-i-Arfa’) was bom in 1861, and succeeded his brother in 1897. He is to all intents and purposes independent of the Persian Govern ment. He has always been consistently friendly to the British, and now in his old age depends more than ever on British advice. He is a capable and sensible man j his influence reaches as far as Dizful, where the Burs even respect him. He owns much territory on Turkish soil. Shaikh Chasib, Shaikh Khazal’s eldest son and heir was born in 1891. He was governor of Ahwaz in 1912-13, but was said to be puerile and neglectful. Even the Shaikh was doubtful whether the Arabs would accept him as chief. Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, the Shaikh’s right-hand man, born about 1850, an important and wealthy mer chant. He is very friendly to the British, but not fully trusted by the Arabs. Both he and his son Mushir-ut-Tujj ar have travelled in India. A very capable man in his prime, but is now too old to do much. His son may succeed him as the Shaikh’s Wazir. Shaikh Hanzal Khan, brother of Shaikh Khazal, born about 1864, Commander-in-Chief to the Shaikh, formerly Governor of Ahwaz. Capable man resembl - ing the Shaikh. Has no ambition regarding the succession, but he is regarded with suspicion by the Shaikh.

In May 1913, he drove the Turks out of El Hasa, and in May 1914, was appoint ed Vali and Commander-in-Chief of Najd under the nominal sovereignty of Turkey. He could raise 5,000 to 7,000 well armed fighting men. He stands head and shoulders above other Arab chiefs, and they have implicit faith in him. Ajaimi .—Son of S’adun Pasha, late chief of the Muntafik Arabs. S’adun Pasha was arrested by the Turks in August 1911 through the treachery of Sayid Talib, and deported to Aleppo, where he died immediately after his arrival. Ajaimi has se veral times threatened Basrah. Saiyid Talib B&amp;y. —(Naqibzadah) Deputy for Basrah, born about 1870, of great influence anion o- the Arabs of Basrah. Until March 1914 he was looked upon as a leader of the “Arab revolt” at Basrah ; but then he suddenly became a pro-Turk. Strong, wilful, utterly unscrupulous, usually in debt. Holds Basrah in the palm of his hand by means of a band of armed men. Has about a dozen murders to his credit.
