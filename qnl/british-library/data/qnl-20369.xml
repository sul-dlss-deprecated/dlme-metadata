A letter dated 51st Atigust has reached me from Ibn Saud. He points out that he was $iot satisfied with the Mohammerah convention, and only ratified it out of deference to the wishes of H.M.Government and the desire to secure a good understanding among the Arabs, particularly with Iraq. He insists that according to the convention, Iraq is under obligation to expel llejd and Shammar refugees, expresses disbelief in the genuineness of Iraq f s efforts to control (?) ■ and restrain them, and the suspicion that the Iraq Govt, inspired raids by the refugees against the Akhwan, and really wishes to retain the former as a weapon against hto. Both matter and tone of the letter point to the urgent desirability of an early conference to discuss outstanding questions between Iraq and Ne.jd as well as the Trans-Jordanian frontier. Further, although I appreciate Your Grace's arguments acxtaK against a personal meeting with Peioal, I an convinced that even were the Trans-Jordania boundary satis- *factorily settled, relations betweeh Ibn Saud and Iraq will never be satisfactory, until that meeting has taken place.

Sir Henry Dobbs, K.C.I.E., 0.3.I., High Commissioner for Iraq., Baghdad. A.O. I received your letter Ho.50/1520 dated 27th An^ust by ohe nands of Dr. Abdollah Damloo.ji my envoy to Your Excellency. I do not deny that my demand for dismissal of some of my subjects from the Iraq territory while they have resided there in a peaceful manner is contrary to the rules of hospitality; but as I was awar^of the misconduct of Shammor tribe and its natural wish for raid, plunder and robbery which- I am afraid may lead •to hostile contending between the tribes on the borders of the two countries and cause disturbances v/hich may lead to misunderstanding in the relations of the two Governments which are in league with each other, I was obliged to insist in my request for their dismissal from the Iraq country and refrain from such difficulties which i^ay lead to protracted correspondence and your repeated annoyance. In fact the thing of which I was afraid happened and they repeatedly aggressed my subjects who were in peace in their towns and who did not commit the slightest hostile act towards the Iraq tribes since the conclusion of the ■ agreement between the two parties. If the highhandednesj^v/hich were committed by Shammor in itself do not effect the concordant . relations existing between the/regions,the remaining of these men who have taken refuge in the centre of Iraq country will disturb the peace and 'order and their actions will break the • • relations of the two countries which will annoy the mind and cause regret. I do not care, oh my friend, that the plundered articles were much or little or that they were restored at the same time or not restored or those raids were meant for Zufair but were made on my subjects by mistake as ;5hammor themselves apologise for them, but it appears that they have purposely raided my subjects, because it is not difficult for the nomad at the time of his raid to distinguish the men of Anaizah, Zafairj etc.etc. Samilarly -Tamyat os Jhadid raided the Asian family residing at Jin Uadhheh and three camels were carried away from them and during their return to Iraq they met with the men of Lam Aba Zaraii of Zafair and the latter restored a part, of the plundered things from them and gave them to their owners and the other part was taken by the raiders. The Iraq Government did not confirm thiV3 incident and consider these two men as acquitted. In support of what I have already stated to Your Excellency about the evil intention of this, tribe is that after .sending your letter dated 2?th August in which you mentioned that in fact if Shammor people did not obey the orders of the Iraq (lovernment and did not abstain from th©ir may raid, it is probable that the Iraq Government/refuse to give them the right of refuge and expel them from their territory A etc, a great raid was occurred under the command of Bin Ayesh who. on 15th iiamazan (=2nd May 1923) raided the Morrah tribe my subject, at Jahamh and carried away 10 camels .from them / and took them to Iraq. Lately in these days I received news that ebskex two more raids were done one on Jahizah. and the other on Baten by some men about whom I have not made enquireis up to now and I,have not received details. I was afraid of the continuous of these aggressions on my subjects which I do not imagine that you will make delay. in putting an end to them. I beg you kindly to do your utmost ( to terminate this matter as was mentioned in Your Excellency *s letter. I have not been informed as yet whether some of the ♦ plundered articles had been restored to their owners or not. I shall thank iour Excellency for your endeavours in this matter and your great care to it, 'MjieTranslation of latter Ho.52, dated 27th Safar 1342 (-9th October 1925) frora Shaikh Sir Abdol Aziz ben Abdor Rahman Al Faisal As Saud, Cl.O.I.E., Soltan of Hejd and Dependencies, to Sir Henry Dobba, K # G. I• ^, 0. o. I., High 0ormnissioner, for Iraq, Baghdad. I be.-; to state that some time a^o I received a telegram from the political Resident in the Persian (lulf informing me of the detention of my official, Saleh Al AdhaJ. in Iraq territories a. when he ./as collecting the revenue from the Dahipashah part:/ who are under Jazza ben Hejlad. I replied that tele^ram at once expressing my regret for that treatment and asking the release of the man in detention. Lately I received the details of the _ detention of the abovementioned man and confiscation of his papers and money and the detention of Jazza ben 'le.jlad and Ja'ad ben Me.jlad and the confiscation of my flag which is with them for the last three years. This evil treatment caused my surprise in addition to my regret which I was not expecting its occurrence under (the administration of) the noble men of ii.ll's British Government. Jazza ben . ejlad and their followers had become my adherents before the formation of the present civil Iraq Government. It was agreed in the supplementary of the agreement between the two parties as was mentioned in the second supplement of Art. 1 that any division of a tribe comes from outside the boundary of the united countries and choses to enter under the protection of either of the two tiovernments this division of tribe will be the subject of the latter Government. This article especially apply to Jazza ben Mejlad and his followers and correponds with his position because he came from Syria where he was residing since a long time and some of the Dalyaashah are residing there up to now. Then he became my subject and took my flag which was confiscated and insulted by the Iraq Government the other day. Thirdly if there was any misunderstanding my official should have been asked to stop his act till the position may become clear after communication and enquiry from me. Fourthly while the aggressions of Shammor on my subjects are going on ■on in good ordsr y,nd I do not 300 ■t.licit' 'tlis Iraq Govornment- punish and expell th©n from th0ir country, I S00 that they are taking every opportunity to complioate my endeavours and bring pressure on me in every way v/ithout any consideration to rights and roiations, (Jndor these circumstances I may consider that the attitudc-j of Iraq Qovornment are not friendly for which I regr©t. As to the latter matter I /am not aware of Your Excellency interpretation to this present proceeding and beg you to give me your views about it. I request Your Excellency to have my.official and Al Mejlad released as soon as possible and his papers and money restored in such a way which may preseve the honour of the official and Al Llajlad and their position.

I be^ to state that some time ago I come,to know of some quarrelsomeness between the Iraq tribesmen such as Yusuf I Almansur ASv S'adun and some of the Zafair Shaikhs. As it is not % my habit to ^ive opportunity to my tribesmen to interfere in affairs \/hich should be dealt with by the Iraq Government and some people of some of my, tribesmen went and participated with 'iusuf Almansur in some of his proceedings, I Was obliged to send an expedition under the command of Fahad ben Jalawi to the Iraq boundaries where my tribesmen are residing in order to punish those of my subjects-who were concerned in those actions. When some of the notorious criminals, rogues and highwaymen, Bin Lami and Shuwaib, who were the other day the the chief actors in plundering and, robbing with Yusuf came to know of this, they entered the interior of Iraq territory .and fled from .justice. As the Governments of Hejd and. Iraq should undertake the punishment of such wicked men and we lid not intend to punish them except on account of their highhandedness to the Iraq tribesmen, therefore, I beg Your Excellency to order their banishment from the Iraq territory and that they may be handed over ,to us so that we may punish them.for their robberies. •hln T' Si MO /'/ / 0 lUSHiRi RtSiOENCHf, i'he ^©litical Agenoy Bahrain. 18/2/24 ^ jfrom 'i'he roliticsl Agent BShmln So She Han^lJla the Pslitioal Hesiasnt.Bashire OONFIDtNIIA.

I may, therefore, have slightly exaggerated delay involved in requesting satisfactory Kejd representatives. They might perhaps reach Kuwait by 24th April. At the same time it will not do to lose sight cf the possibility that Ibn Saud's ready acceptance of the suggestion was due to the fact that at the time he understood that the despatch of his son in time was out of the question, and, when it comes to the point, other excuses may be forthcoming. The other consideration in my telegram fto. 81 and personal telegram,however, hold good. As regards Baghdad telegram iio. 100 I agree in the main but I learn from uortion of (?)

Iraq arid vrans-Jordania deputies r. tar ted for Basrah with orders l:o fly thence to xuwAit. Yesterday, however, news arrived of a serious raid into Iraq of Aktean against the JUiwaniyah tribes, which took place on mrch i4th. rhe main fighting apparently took place in the neighbourhooa of Uxm Hashim, north of the western angle of the neuoral enclave. The raiders are reported to have seized immense numbers of rarans camped camels and sheep and 80 tents, and to have BHspBat on the spot. All the Mesopotamia tribes have closed in towards' the railway and are greatly excited. ihe Government of Iraq in agreement with me have sent orders to their delegates notto proceed beyond Basrah, until full apology and redress have heen givenxf for this incursion, which makes discussions between the two Governments impossible, especially in view of the oultan of Siejd^ ihreats, conveyed in his letter of 25rd February Ho.29 to the Besident in the Persian Gulf Bushire that he could no longer he responsible for restraining his tribes. These previous threats make it appear probable that the raid now reported was under the orders of Bin Saud. ihe ^esopotamian Government will, so far as is possible, restrairdt its tribes from retaliation, but will find this exceedingly difficult unless prompt reparation is made. If the raid proves, to have been as serious as first reports imply, it appears it may be necessary to bring to bear on the Sultan definite threat of cutting off supplies by sea. ihe iYans-Jordan delegates will arrive Ku ait by air on March 2«jnd.

The leader of one raided section has now arrived at Baghdad. His detailed statements, which are.8 confirmed by other refugees at Sam awah and elsewhere, prove that the raid was of considerable proportions. The exact size of the raiding party and full extent of the damage not yet ascertained, but it is certair that it was on too large a scale to have taken place without the cognizance of and approval® of Bin Saud, In one section of the Khazail alone 70 men, 20 women and ^0 children were killed, and many women died of thirst during their flight across the desert. Very large numbers of donkeys and sheep were taken by the raiders. All tribes East of the Euphrates concentrated along the iailway line, and great indignation was aroused among the tribes of the interior by the sight of train loads of. refugee women. • In these circumstances, I consider it impossible to suggest that the Iraq delegates should proceed to Kuwait, and an immediate protest to the gultan of Nejd is necessary.

Last night the Sheikh of Kuwait gave me the first definite detailed account of the raid from-desert sources. Hilal al Mutairi, a rich-and influential pearl merchant of Kuwait, himself half a Bedouin and with great influence with Mutair tribesmen, who was at Jahrah watching for Ajman activity, sent in a Mutairi relative who was with Feisal al Dawish throughout the raid. He states that the Akhwan force was very- strong and would have wiped out the Iraq Arabs in those regions but for mismanagement. The advanced guard on strong horses pressed on and outstripped their own weaker companions ansl got l completely out of touch of the main body. They arrived at their objective with horses tired out and late in the day, and their victims put up a defence against which the Akhwan horses suffered severely, and the result was that nearly all the camels and sheep were safely withdrawn so fax as the {-?-) were concerned. 28 Iraqis were killed and six Akhwan, including three of note. The Akhwan camped on the spot the next day, and the following morning saw three aeroplanes, hid in fear and eventually retreated to safety, sent a messenger to the Sultan reporting the engagement and asking for orders whether they should proceed to Jauf. I asked the Sheikh what he thought Bin gaud or the Akhwan imagined they gained by these wild adventures. He said 'fame, and to convince the Bedouin that Bin saud was not played out* 1 . Secondly, the Trans-Jordania delegates have now applied of for permission to leave Kuwait on the grounds tbaX the Nejd raid on Iraq and further Nejd concentrations threatening danger to Kuwait. It is now no longer possible to doubt the Suitan»s complicity in the raid or that the raid occurred. Thie alsoTMs also makes it certain that the Sultan will be afraid to send his son, even if he ever contemplated, doing so. Any possible arrangements that could be made between Nejd and Trans-Jordania depend on conditions that will not be fulfilled this year at any rate. In the circumstances, I see no future for the conference and consider its continuance merely involves loss of dignity for H.M.Government, and recommend it be dissolved * without further delay.

There is no doubt that Faisal Dawish was at head of raiders t but regular lorces of ikhwan were few in number five standards- % • (say # 7C0 men.

These men came and went at will and were kept at a good distance from actual regular force under Dawish. It is said to be owing to the presence of these rabs that this Ikhwan raid was not of usual ferooioiE character and bore^ the aspect of an ordinary bedouin raid 'Ip by? / of old time. My informant says no women and children were touched and that many lives were spared by connivance of rab helpers of Ikhwan. If Ira tribes suffered in the way described by 1'rai account it was probably due to panic and their hurried retreat across waterless waste.

The whole question of tbe defence of Iraq against Bedouin raids has been carefully considered, and although we are prepared to take all action possible within Iraq borders, raids will continue unless every effort is made to secure reciprocal anti-raiding agreement. The argument that an important raid cannot take place without the cognizance of the suzerain chief is a two-edged one and might equally be applied . to the Shammar and other raids for which Feisal disclaims ♦ responsibility. I am not prepared to send protests to Bin Saud at the moment when his representatives are at Kuwait for the purpose of arriving at an agreement to (?end) these raids, unless Iraq also sends representatives and undertakes to refrain during the conference from retaliatory measures. H.M,Government do not agree that the recent raid is adequate reason for suspending negotiations. (?

I am inclined to agree that no useful purpose can be served by continuance of the conference in the circumstances, but its discontinuance wil leave the Iraq frontier dangerously exposed, unless prompt* action is taken by H.M.Government to bring Bin Saud to his senses. There are (-?-) reports of a great impending sweep by the Akhwan to attack the Anezeh tribe lest of Hit (?), and the chief of the Anezeh in panic has askpd me to permit the whole of the tribe to take refuge in Syriin territory. After discussion he has been persuaded to order a defensive concentration of the whole tribe in the angle formed by the Euphrates with the French boundary, near El Kaim, and a section of armoured cars has been pushed up to their support. The French authorities have been informed. If an Akhwan attack in this quarter materialises, it may make the motor routes between Ramadi and Damascus insecure. I suggest that immediate action be now taken to cut off the Sultan of Nejd's supplies by sea, and a? pledge demanded of him that no further raiding shall take place and 'that compensation ahkll be given without delay for the loss of life and property occasioned by the last raid.

The Akhwan killed all the male wounded and prisoners both men and boys but spared the women, casualties among the latter being due to rifle fire at the time of the attack. The attacking force numbered between 12,000 and 16,000, and was commanded in person by Feisal al Dawish, the principle lieutenant of 'Bin Saud. The attack took place on the morning of March l^th, led by horsemen who -were subsequently reinforced by a large body of camelmen. The fighting continued until sunset, and the Akhwan force camped on the battlefield for three days after the attack. * The area raided iwas a network of nullahs in the neighbourhood of Umm- e1-Hashim Just within the Iraq border. I will now respectful- -ly examine the argument that Bin SadLd was not more responsible for this raid than the Iraq Government for the Sahmmar raids of last summer, and that the two sets of raids can be treated as parallel. In the case of the Akhwan raid, firstly there was a ■ conference aittlng to discuss relations between the two States, which entails a very special measure of abstinence from provoc- -ation on both sides; secondly. Bin Saud had, on grouhds which were shown in my telegram n0 .II3 of the 4th March to be completely inadequate, officially threatened in a letter dated 22nd February ^924 that he would not restrain his tribes from attacks on Iraq and as mentioned in para kof the sane telegrair. there were reports for days before the raid of preparttiens being openly made for it II(0% w 11. .7^ for it by Feisal. These facts confirm the conclusions reached unamimously 'by Trevor, Knox and myself that Bin Saud must have been fully cognizant of preparations for the raid. It seems doubtful in fact whether he would deny this. Thirdly, the raid took place in Iraq territory. Fourthly the loss in lives and property was very great. In contrast, the circumstances of the Nejd-SkJKnuiar raids last®simmer were as follows:- firstly, there was no conference sitting and thus no special aggravation or question of honour; secondly, the raiders were small bodies, not % more than about 100C men, who could cover long desert distances Hi* without much preparation and without being observed by the authorities: thirdly, attacks by the raiders in no instance took place within Nejd borders. There was thus no question of invasion, although it is true that the victims were mostly caravans from Nejd trading into Iraq. Fourthly, the damage inflicted was comparatively insignificant, the total maximum of casualties which can be gathered from rather vaguea accounts to be claimed by Nejd, being not more than 50, all of them men. These facts will, I think,show that there can be no comparison between them. A review of the attitude of Iraq shows that it has shown great forebearance and its procedure under great provoc- -ation has been strictly in accordance with international principles accepted by the League of Nations. Firstly, although Feisal himself was convinced by the first reports which he had « received following on the Sultan's threats that a very serious raid had occurred and was in a state ££ of extreme indignation, he was persuaded by me to hold his hand, restrain his people from counter raids and keep his delegates awaiting full explanat- f I -ions at Busrah. inquiries by a British Officer have now been extendedl over three weeks, and have fully proved the deliberate and destructive invasion of Iraq territory while the conference was sitting. Secondly, the Iraq Government nowa asks that instead of reprisals the measures laid down by the League of Nations shall be adopted against the offender, namely the cutting off of supplies. I have strained my influence with Feisal to the111. to the utmost in imposing this patient attitude upon him, and gravely fear it will not stand the further strain which would be involved by requesting him to order his representatives to continue the conference after the Nejd agression has been proved and before any apology or restitution has been received from Nejd. Feisla has to think of his reputation with his people and dare not take action which would be represented by the restive assembly » now sitting as a complete sacrifice of national honour. Critics of the treaty and agreements in the* assembly would inevitably seize on our refusal to bring pressure on the Sultan according to the precepts of the League as proof that we shall not carry out our promises of defending Iraq, if in any way inconvenient to us. These arguments would be reinforced by the fact that it is notorious that the first move towards cutting off of Nejd supplies would bring Bin Saud to his knees, so that Iraq frontiers could be adequately secured against further trouble without any cost or trouble to H.M.Government. The mere rumour that orders for the cutting off of supplies had already issued, due t(i the expected steamer failing to call at Bahrain some weeks ago, caused alarm throughout Nejd. I beg that the foregoing arguments may be given full weight as in view of them I am constrained to warn If.M,Government that insistence on Iraq ! s immediately continuing the conference without attempting to obtain restitution may jeopardise the whole position here.

Repeated to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Knox, No.527. Dated 9th April 192^, I agree* that Bin Saud must have known a raid was imminent, his letter No»79 dated 22nd February forwarded with my despatch No. 15 cf the 2nd March shows this, but I am not atall sure that he could have prevented it. Feisal al Dawish is, it is true, one of Bin Saud 1 s principal lieutenants, but he is, I think, the leader of the mote energetic and fanatical of the Akhwan, and is rather out of hand. His letter dated the kth Rajab (enclosure in my above-mentioned despatch) is decidedly truculent in tone, and I think Bin Saud fears he would lose his influence over the more fanatical of his followers, if he tried to restrain Feaisal too much. I regaatd Bin ^Saud^ letter No. 79 more as a warning and as an attempt to forestall and show extenuating circumstances for raids by Feisal and others of his more fanatical subjects than as a threat, see my despatch N0.53 .T of the 20th March. In the letter to Bin Saud dated l^th March (copy enclosed with this despatch T warned the Sultan that action by aeroplane would be taken against Nejdi raiders entering Iraq.

As the conference has now terminated, the question of pressing the Government of Iraq to send delegates to Kuwait no longer arises. Before considering the question of a pretest to Bin Paud or the necessity for taking further action, T desire to be satisfied as to facts about which evidence a pears to be conflicting. Please report fully on your return from tour on the following points:- (1) You comment on the forebearance of the Iraq Govt. \ under provocation, but it appears possible that such incidents as that reported in para 209, Intelligence summary of March 20th may have given initial provocation and that (-?-) raid was a reprisal. (2) The account given by Knox's infornsant in his telegram ilo.102 states that raiders concealed themselves on the approach of three aeroplanes on the day after the raid. Driver's report states 12,000 to 16,000 men camped on the battlefield for three days. Ait Officer Commanding's telegrams ending witn X.621g of March 31st indicate no•concentration was at any time seen from the air. It seems inconcievable that a force of the size reported by Driver could have rendered itself invisible. (3) In view of the withdrawal of the frontier tribes consequent on rumours of impending raid, referred to, in Intelligence Summary para 177and elsewhere, it is surprising that such large numbers ot women and children and cattle should have been in the neighbourhood of the frontier when the raid took place. (4-) There is great discrepancy in the number of casualties mentioned in Knox's telegram referred to abowe and those in your telegram under reply. (5) Knox and Trevor stated in their telegram of March 22nd No.96 cutting off supplies would not be felt effectively for some \months. Your telegram under reference anticipates immediate effect.

On the dates on which raiders were within 'Iraq territory aeroplanes did not fly anywhere near the locality of the raid, ^he total number of raiders is now estimated at about two thousand which is confirmed in telegram ^o. 104 from Knox mentioning that a mob of Bedouins joined the original 700, 3. Humours of raids had been so numerous that the tribesmen caught by the raid appear to have treated the warning as cry of wolf and stayed on their usual crazing ground. 4. Estimate of casualties submitted by driver was the result ot most careful comparison of accounts of eyewitnesses and its accuracy is more likely to be relied upon them that of a casual Arab informant. 5 ' 1 con9U lted Trevor on his way through Baghdad and he agrees with me that the moral effect of supplies being stopped would be instantaneous although privation would of course not b« actually felt immediately.

At the same time,after consultation with the Govt of India, they are not prepared to resort to the expedient of stopping IBN SAUD^ supplies as a means of exacting reparation for raid into Iraq territory* H.M. Govt are of course anxious to do all they can to assist the Iraq Govt in repelling incursions into Iraq. IBN SAUD has already been informed that if raiders enter Iraq air action will be taken against them, see Col Trevor's telegram date-d Jth April last, rept to you as No. 527. Such action, taken as it would be for purpose of /defending Iraq territories from invasion, would be in strict accordance with our obligations to Govt of Iraq. You would have full support of H .M. Govt in proceeding accordingly should the necessity arise. Further than that we are not, as at present advised, prepared to go. We are most reluctant to take xtx* steps that would inviive us in acute controversy with IB^ SAUD and might lead, to intervention in Central Arabian affairs which we are most anxious to avoid. Objections to the proposed action have been raised by the Govt of India on Indian grounds, but based objections/on the general grounds of policy appear| to h.m. Govt to be still more weighty. We did our utmost by means of the KowaitCon%rence to bring about a general settlement which would prevent any recurrence of incidents such as those of which the Iraq Govt compiains. Unfortunately the attempt ended in failure, for which it woyld be unfair to attribute all tti at the blame to Ibn Saud. We shall be ready/all times to make a further effort to promote settlement when the opportunity prevents itself ( in this connection see my telegram of today addressed to Bushire)• Meanwhile the Government of Iraq must rest content with the assurance that they can count on our assistance against unprovoked attack &gt; but they shouaia understand^f cour8e i that they cannot expect such assist ance against attack directly provoked by prior raids upon Nejd territory.

Riadh S5th Muharram 1343 = 2S5th August 1994.1 '&amp;) Translation of a letter Uo* 92, dated tiie 28th Muharram 1343 (30th August 1924), from the Sultan of Hejd to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. A.C. I had the pleasure of receiving your two letters, Hos. 128 and 129. I have understood their contents in spite of the obscurity in the purport of the last letter, namely Ho. 129. In this letter however it was mentioned that His Majesty T s Government throw on me some responsihil- -ity for collisions 'between some of my subjects and the Iraq tribes and for attacks on the latter. It has therefore become necessary for me to inform you of the reasons for those collisions. From the time of the occupation of the Iraq by the British Government until the formation of the present Government, which is headed by King Faisal, I had not observed any movements being made on the boundaries of the two countries, nor do I remember any friction between the tribes of the two countries, but troubles began with the formation of the present Govern- -ment and the establishment of its King, and also with the appearance of Yusuf A1 Mansur with a large force from Iraq near toy borders. This force had, at that time, no target but Nejd and its tribes; this was wliat necessit- -ated the collissions which occurred. This hurricane culminated with the demarcation of boundaries between the two parties which was approved at the Uqair Conference. And from that time up to the time when the late collision happened, that is, during the past two years, not a single case of transgression or outtage committed by Hejdis occurred on the Iraq boundaries, whereas at the aamfc time we see that the Iraq Government were encouraging the Shammar tribe of Nejd living in Iraq territory to carry2 I out constant raids upon the 'borders of Uejd and to plunder property and cattle from ik&amp;E her in excessive quantities, and there are in our possession numerous official proofs issued from British sources in Iraq and from Your Honour and also from the Iraq Government,which will prove our claim and support it. S'or these we did nothing but put forward verbal arguments to the British and Iraq Governments. The Iraq Government did not remain content with al this, 'but when we expelled Yusufj/Manaur, who had resided in the midst of our tribes and was misleading them to effect raids on his territory, and after we restpred the plunder which was in the hands of our subjects to the Dhafir tribe of Iraq and punished our subjects for en- -croachment, the Iraq Government rose and misled our afore-mentioned tribe and attracted them to themselves and received them joyfully and accorded them courtesy and commenced organizing, arming,aiui supporting and sending them towards the Hejd boundaries. Then they were guilty of robbery, plundering, ambush and illegal acts which caused disorder in Hejd territory and dispelled security there and aroused the tribes of Hejd to a state of excitement; at this we did nothing more than express numerous protests, instances of which may be found in our letters ITos* 47,48,75 and 79 addressed to you, many protests addressed to the High Commissioner for Iraq by me and the arguments of our representatives who appeared at the Kuwait Conference for a settlement of the dispute. There was no negligence on our part in tjae matter. These arguments were not sufficient to prevent those continuous attacks which were x ^anred on us by Iraq, and which are still insistent.3 I warned you on tlie IVtli Rajab 1342 (23rd ]?e'b- -ruary 1924) in my letter ^ T Oo 79, regarding provable reprisals and counter attacks 'by our excited and stirred tribesmen wlio were somewliat out of hand. irom tlie above you will see that I was certain that evil would happen before it actually happened, and did my utmost to stand aloof from it. In viev/ of the above mentioned real and proved events for which proofs are available and which support my contention, I am clearly no transgressor as regards Iraq and therefore am not responsible for the apparent result of the provocation - all the more so because I had never desired that it should come to pass, and, previous to that, had taken no part in such matters.ei/XO , 61/11. 61/14 fi Telegram P.

Message begins / I r a n G o ye rnm en t having received reports that certain small sections of the MUTAIR, ATAIBAH and HARB tribes resident in Iraq had carried out or attempted to carry out small raids on AKHWAKT tribes, determined to put a stop to these occurrences and have taken the most energetic measures to prevent all such raids in future. They have been promised that if necessary they will receive Iks; assistance ^. A . f from ^ in carrying out these measures. They had requested me to inform Your Highness accordingly and to ask you to be good enough to issue strict orders to your tribes on the Iraq frontier to refrain from raiding into Iraq. Before I could communicate with Your Highness I received news that/ on December 26th AKHWAN tribesmen raided Iraq shepherd tribes near UMM RAHAL. A British military officer who to happened vat be with the tribes at the time and was under fire from the raiders reports that the raiders probably numbered 2000, that they captured a large number of sheep and killed about 100 persons, including all the men and boys who had been wounded in the attack. I caused immediate action by aeroplane to be taken against the raiders and believe that a certain amount of loot was abandoned in consequence of this action. I have now received a report that on December 29th a second raid took place on Iraq tribes near NUKRAT SULAIMAN. I request that Your Highness will issue immediate2 immediate orders for the return of any loot taken over the frontier and for the prevention of any such raids in future, and will give me an assurance that such orders have been issued and will 'be carried out. Unless this is done it will 'be difficult for me to restrain Iraq tribes from raids in retaliation, and the consequent state of hostility 'between the frontier tribes of the two states will, I am sure, be regretted by Your Highness as much as by the Iraq Government and myself. Should any further raids occur I shall take all necessary steps for the severest punishment of the raiders by all the means at my disposal while they are within Iraq territory. - MBssage ends.

Emir Faisal has received envoy from RUWALLAH trihe 'bring-ing information that the Sultan of Nejd has order- -ed TORI SHALLAN to make submission to him on behalf of the tribe. Nuri asks Faisal for his private advice. The Ruwallah stretch through Trans-Jordanian and Syrian territory from AZRAQ to the neighbourhood of BOMS, right across the line of communication betv/een Iraq on the one hand and Trans- -Jordania and Syria on the other hand; and if they make pol- -itical submission to Ibn Saudr w ^i c ^- will probably result in their conversion to the AKHWAU Faith - Ibn Saud will, for all practical purposes, have attained his long-cherished aim of extending his sphere north into Syrian territory and cut off Iraq from the Mediterranean. He will then be able to bring pressure to bear on the British Government in connection with securing air routes, pipe line, or railway between Iraq and the Mediterranean in accordance with schemes revealed by him to HOLMES, vide my letter No. 39 of January 15th, 1924. Moreover, the submission of the Ruwallah would be followed by a similar demand by Ibn Saud upon the AHIZAH of Iraq, which they would find greater difficulty in resisting. All the BEDUWIN in the Syrian Desert would then become feudatories of Nejd, and an exceedingly difficult situation would arise for both Mandatory Powers. The tribes are most unwilling to comply with the Sultan's demands but their contention is that Nejd is now a formidable power and unless the Mandatory Powers|T^ offer protection against it they cannot resist. The Sultan has no excuse for aggression as he has 'been officially informed of the frontiers of Iraq and Trans-Jordania as against 3SeJd, which completely shut him off from Syria and Chi provide for^hroad strip of territory across the desert under British influence. I strongly urge that Great Britain and France should inform him jointly that they will not suffer interference on his part with tribes living in their zones, and that any attack on such tribes for failure to make submission to him will be resisted. Emir Faisal will keep the messenger from Huri here until he knows the attitude of His Majesty^ Government. Addressed Secretary of State for the Colonies, repeated Jerusalem and Beirut, ITo. 21-S.

I must respectfully represent that King Paisul could have no more urgent and legitimate interest than in taking measures to prevent Ibn Saud so extending his political and religious influence as to cut off Mesopotamia from the Mediterranean and subsequently detach the powerful AMARAT ANIZAH tribe, which lives exclusively within Mesopot- -amian borders, from allegiance to the Government of Iraq. This would make the Iraq hold on the whole of the Euphrates precarious and cause panic in the Holy Shiah Cities of Kerbela and Nejef. What is feared is not so much actual attack on the RUWALLAH and subsequently on the AMARAT ANIZAH, as their being completely won/ over to the Sultan of Hejd by a mixture of cajolery and threats which would give no ovejrb cause for war.

I desire to reaffirm the assurance given 'by the late Government that you will have the full support of His Majesty's Government in taking air action against unprovoked Wahhabi encroachments. While I am entirely opposed to anything in the nature of an air attack on Nejd territories, I consider that the Air Foree should not be debarred from following up raiding parties across the Iraq border should such action be necessary to make the punishment really effective.

Reference my memorandum Ho.38-3 dated 6th February I925, The number of sheep plundered near Jahrah on the tst February proved to be only \ jO , and not 350 as originally supposed - the merchant was expecting 350, but luckily they had been despatched in two lots, and It was only the first which was captured. Of these no haye since been recovered by Ibn Sa T iId 1 s detachment in the desert. The above was only one of a series of outrages committed by a band of raiders, op rather robbers, composed - at any rate in part - of seml-nomadic local •Awftzim, who have been terrorizing the country round Kuwait for the last few weeks. On the 14th February a patrol of fourteen mounted men sent out by the Shaikh encountered thirty of them near Jahrah, and, after getting help from the village succeeded in captur ing eleven men, whom they brought Into Kuwait, and who are now In prlsoa.

But the wicked and the refugees did not obey the government's orders as, in the beginning of the month of Ram ad han (= 26th March to 24th iipril 1925 ), ouU tribes have been plundered: 40 camels have been taken away by Ibn iluiran al Jab elan; 50 camels have been taken away from the Earb tribe and carried to Irai territory , but we do not know wuo have taken these away: 2$0 camels were taken away by *bu Fha^rat al &lt;jman who fled nowadays to Iraq on his own accord , and some men gathered around him and % took the said camels from the ^1 Awaaim. as soon as istoSi these were taken away we wrote to our friend , or Daly, and informed him of these happenings and we received his re^ly , but ne made no mention about what I am now dealing with.

I did so and received the reply that he was awaiting instructions from Interior. I telegraphed again on July 5th,and on July 7th received the following report by telegraph, begins Interior has ordered sale of the camels and retention of money on deposit and has informed me secretly this action necessitated by failure of Ibn Saud to send representative to London to discuss questions outstanding between him and Iraq. Ends. I do not know anything about this decision but 1 would point out, as promise to hand over camels was conveyed to Ibn Saud's Agent through this Agency, failure to do so puts us in a false position, where, in spite of fear of the Akhwan, sympathy is generally more with Hejd than Iraq.

Telegram R.. From To' Repeated No. 254-3. Dated 11th received 12th July 1925. Your telegram No. 428, of July 8th. The facts are that as soon as the seizure of the camels by refugees was known, the Iraq Government took them from the refugees and removed the latter to the notth with the intention of considering what further action should 'be taken regarding the camels. , The Administrative Inspector, Basra, sent the message to the Nejd Agent at Kuwait without authority. Later, it was represented to me that there was no indication how long it would take 'before the original owners of the camels could be brought to identify them and that the maintenance of the camels was a burden on the Iraq Government. I accordingly consented to their being sold and the amount kept in deposit until it appeared how the negotiations with Nejd developed. No message of the kind passed on to you by the Administrative Inspector, Basrah, was authorized by me. If I had known of the arrival of the Nejd Agent at Zubair to take the camels in reply to the unauthorized message from the Administrative Inspector I should probably have ordered the camels or the proceeds of the sale to be handed over to him, but news since received of very heavy Akhwan raid about the 23rd June on the Dhafir, in which it is reported that about 2,000 camels were taken, makes it impossible to take anjic such action. I shall ask you to send a protest to Ibn Saud regarding this raid as soon as details have been further verified. HIGH COmnSSIONER. ITelegram From To Repeated 61/14. P. High Commissioner, Baghdad.

His Britannic Maje3ty»s Agent telegraphed to His Excellency on the 1st of May, 1926, that the Sultan agreed and that he had instructed the Amir of Hail to collaborate with »Iraqi officials in this manner. His Highness informed the British Agent that the Amir of Hail was responsible for the whole length of the 'Iraq frontier but that if small issues arose in connection with the Persian Gulf, they should be referred to the Amir of Hasa. 3. His Excellency has subsequently asked the Sultan whether he would object to correspondence between 1 Iraq officials and the Amir of Hasa on minor matters which concerned him directly. I will not fail to inform you of Ibn Sard's reply. I have the honour to be. Sir, Yourmost obedient servant.

The Residency, Bagdad, dated 21st October, 1926. Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch No, 983 dated the 6th of October, 1926, on the subject of the constitution of the Tribunal to be established under Article 2 of the Bahra Agreement. 2. There would appear to be clerical errors in the first and second paragraphs of that despatch, as Mr. Jordan 1 s despatch No.247 was dated the 15th of April and not the 15th of May, and similarly the date of Jbn 3a'ud^ letter, a copy of which was enclosed with that despatch, was the 11th of April. 3. Mr. Jordan's suggestion that Ibn Sa'ud is ill-disposed to the constitution of the tribunal to be established under the Bahra Agreement appears to ignore the latter's letter of the 23rd of August, 1926, a copy of which was sent to you under cover o f my despatch No. 1251 dated th*» 30th of September, 1926. In that letter Ibn Sa'ud reiterates his acceptance of the suggestion that the headquarters of the tribunal should be at Kuwait, promises to furnish me with the names and number of the individuals The Right Hon' ble L.C.M.S. Amery, P .C., M.P. , Secretary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street, London, S.W.I.(wj) -2- whom he intends to appoint as members of the tribunal, and specifically mentions that he attaches great importance to this tribunal. He makes no mention of the suggestion of the 1 Iraq Government that the tribunal should be presided over by a British officer and his original reply to this suggestion, contained in his letter of tne 11th of April, was a cryptic reference to Article 2 of the Bahra Agreement, the meaning of which I have not as yet been able to discover. It would, appear, however, from his correspondence with Mr. Jordan on the subject of the tribunal to be set up under the ^adda Agreement, that Ibn Sa^ud is likely to be willing to agree to a British President, provided that he holds no official capacity in ♦Iraq. I suggest, therefore, that either I, myself, should again address Ibn 3a f ud, or that you should do so, calling attention to his previous correspondence with me and emphasizing the importance attached by His Majesty's Government to the early establishment of this tribunal. 4. I have considered in the case, at all events, of the first conference, which would have to decide a mass of claims, whether it would not be desirable to appoint a president from some other European nation. It appears to me, however, that such an appointment would involve both Ibn Sa'ud and the 'Iraq Government in considerable unnecessary expense, and I am inclined to suggest, subject of course to the concurrence of the-5- Honourable the Resident in the Persian Gulf, thit the conference shall be presided over hy Major More, the Political Agent at Kuwait. 5. In regard to the suggestion that disputes which may arise should 'be settled by direct negotiation, I would point out that such direct negotiation has already been going on for some months between officials of the 'Ir^q Government and Kajd officials. The suggestion that local officials on either side should correspond with each other with a view to the settle ment of minor troubles as and when they arise, was made to Ibn Sa^d by Mr. Bourdillon on the 23rd of April, 1926, and was accepted by Ibn Sa*ud (vide telegram No.46 dated the 1st of May, 1926, from His Majesty^s Acting Consul, Jeddah, to the foreign Office). This direct correspondence between local officials h^s been working satisfactorily and a number of minor raids have been disposed of. It would, however, be impossible to deal in this way with the mass of claims that existed prior to the ratification of the Bahra Agreement, nor do I conceive it to be the desire of Ibn Sa^d that they should be so dealt with. 6.

His deportation fffom the island was under con- -templation when he hastily left for Kuwait. He was refused permission to return to Bahrain in 1922, but was permitted to do so in 1923 on condition that he refrained from politics. After abusing this concession he sudden- ~ly left for Qatar, whence he proceeded to Riyadh. There he got into touch with Ibn Saud, who nominated him as one of the Hajd delegates to the Kuwait Conference,of 192ft. I know nothing of his subsequent activities. 4.

Hafiz Wafcba is an Egyptian by origin and ov/ing to his fanatical anti—British sentiments and political activities, was imprisoned in and later deported from Egypt to India during the course of the War* In India however it appears that his political activities were again the cause of his being deported from there and he was returned to lilgypt* iLater he was allowed to proceed to Iraq and Kow^jt to bring his family to Igypt, but he installed himself in Bahrain where he opened a school and for some time acted as correspondent to the Egyptian newspaper ^El Akbar tt * Later still he came in touch with Bin Saud and because of the tt Rajal al Khasa 1 * of the Imam whom he represented at the Kowelt Conference and again at the Bahra Conference, together with Y'usef Yasin* My information would tend to show that his anti-British views have been considerably modified recently and General Clayton, when the question of allowing Hafiz Y/ahba to proceed to India arose, strongly recommended him, on account of the helpful tendencies he had showed during the conference* There would appear to be no doubt that he retains pan- Islamic ideas. He keeps in very close touch with the local Egyptian Consul and there are certain indications that his national tendencies are stronger than his loyalty to Bin Saud# But of this latter I have only suspicions and no direct evidence. 3o I am informing Bin Saud that Your Lordship has no objec tion to iz proceeding to Palestine* 4* Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Poreign Office and Cairo* I have, etc*, Sd* S*R.

Most of the correspondence is between the Political Residency in Bushire, the Political Agencies in Bahrain and Kuwait, the High Commissioner in Baghdad, the Colonial Office in London, the Government of India, Ibn Sa'ud himself and his delegates.The majority of the volume is concerned with cross-border raids and counter raids between Iraq and Najd and efforts to put a stop to them. With the British attempting to mediate, the raids were carried out by the Ikhwan and tribal groups in Iraqi and Kuwaiti territory, including sections of the 'Ajman, Mutayr, Shammar, Awazim, 'Utaibah, Harb, and Dahamshah tribes. The documents reflect the divergent opinions among British officials on what British policy should be in the region as well as the inadequacies of the borders as they were defined. The volume ends with efforts to set up a tribunal to settle claims of compensation between the two governments as stipulated in the Bahra Agreement.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ikhwan, military and religious brotherhood</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Shammar (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>'Ajmān (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Muṭayr (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>'Awāzim (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Ḥarb (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>ʻUtaybah (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Dahamshah (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000226#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
