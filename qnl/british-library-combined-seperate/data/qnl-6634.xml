This is followed by a few ad hoc reports of changes in place names in Afghanistan and Iraq between 1939 and 1941, a list of place names in Libya and Syria in 1941, and the decision of the Government of Siam to change the name of the country to Thailand in 1939. The correspondence ends with a list of place names in the Chinese autonomous region of Sinkiang in 1946.At the back of the file are copies of several PCGN titles published between 1923 and 1937, for the following: Arabia, Iraq (Mesopotamia), Turkey, Asiatic (including Persian) Names, Oceanic (Pacific) Names, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.The file includes two dividers, which give a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. These are placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Committee on Geographical Names</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Gazetteers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002d4#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002d4#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002d4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
