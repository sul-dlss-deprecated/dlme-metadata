He has not made any settlement of our claim against him, but some of his villages have been sequestered and other property seized to meet part of the same. Hissam-ed-Dowleh, his father, has just died, and I have reason to know that Hashmat has refused to listen to Turkish suggestions that he should lend his story to be made capital against us. As it is important that we should avoid doing anything that may assist Turkish cause, present moment would appear to me a favourable one to allow Hashmat to return home. (No. 37.) R.
