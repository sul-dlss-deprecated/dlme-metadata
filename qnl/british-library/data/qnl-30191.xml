Sadchikov is about 37, and after studying philosophy at Perm University 'became professor of that subject au # Moscow University. He then joined the diplomatic service and served in Tehran, and in the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. He 'became Ambassador to Belgrade # in March 19?5. He is married and has a wife of Ukrainian origin who speaks however; no language but Russian. Sadchikov seems aole, intelligent anda shrewd observer but speaks onl^ ^ssian and a few words of French. As the Soviet Ambassador, his position in this country was one of great prominence. Before the elections last year he appeared on several occasions at political demonstrations m the Company of Sal fitoV Much was made of this by the Government in order to prove to the people of Yugoslavia that the regime enjoyed the full support of the Soviet Union.

IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL My telegram No. ) Bolivar informs me in confidence that Soviet Government are withdrawing their Ambassador Mikhailov on the ground of ill-health and have asked for agrdment of present Counsellor and Chargd d’Affaires Maximov as Ambassador. I have little doubt that withdrawal of Mikhailov is due to his failure to induce Iranian Government to accept Soviet's offer of war material.

Cairo No.77. Saving Soviet Ambassador recently informed his colleagues that he was leaving for Russia for medical treatment, 2, There is perhaps some ground for the suspicion of Persian officials that his departure was not due tojillness or at least not to illness alone. Present Prime minister saw the Ambassador the day after the Persian Government had refused to accept the conditions attachedto the Soviet offer of war material and found him ”looking like a man condemned to death yet maintaining that he was perfectly well. From that moment the Ambassador was never seen except presmaably by Russians. Several times I was informed by the Soviet Embassy ^hat he was better but my requests to be allowed to call on him were always refused and my American colleague and an official or . the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had similar experience. 3 Mikhailov is believed to be high up in the Party but he may have fallen into disgrace. Stalin was probably pleased with his call on the Shah.and vatn the a °Geptance of the off r of war material and a Soviet ambassador ^ho bailed to complete the transaction might well be unpopular with th- Kremlin. 4. If Mikhailov has gone for good neither the British nor the American Embassy will be sorry. He s ® ei ^ d h 9 c ? 1 ^, 2^ f cm&lt;rm clous and we failed to get a word out of him either for or 3 against anything we saidg The Charge d'affaires Maximov, who is an old Persia hand, is a clever intriguer, hut he is human, has a sense of humour, and can often he r-gged into taking action. fConies sent to nr, Wiltshire]1 m @ H No.39 (61/9/44) Sir, XED Witfc the Compliment* »* of th^ Unde^ Secretary of State for Foreign AffaifiPITISH LEGATION TBHF - Sf£B 19M i r ' : !

He was wearing the new diplomatic uniform. According to the Minister of Court the Shah noticed two things in particular about Monsieur Mikhailovj that his uniform with its hanging dagger recalled that of Nazi diplomatists; and that he seemed awkward and made no bow to His Majesty. rf?' LA &amp; 2. It is early to judge, but so far M. Mikhailov has failed to come up to the expectations which I had formed after reading the latest report on him by His Majesty’s Legation in Kabul. He has certainly shown no candour, and he has failed signally to respond to my own; but allowance must be made for the fact that he has taken over his new post at a moment when Stalin appears to have a new policy viz. to support the Shah, while the Soviet Embassy has been trying with little disguise to impose upon the electors in various consti tuencies members of the party of the extreme left, the Tudeh.

Smirnov s health it is true has never been good in Tehran, Operation for appendicitis v/hich was performed here did not effect the expected cure. His departure is generally regretted. His relations with this Legation were particularly good. 2. I feel that report by British Legation Kabul on his successor would be very useful.
