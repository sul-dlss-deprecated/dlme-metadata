A man rides a donkey towards the camera while other figures are gathered or walk along the path in the distance. On the left of the path some domed tents are visible, but the dwellings and structures in the distance and to the right of the path are more permanent built structures, including at least one white-washed building. Palms and other vegetation are interspersed around the village and coastline.Along the horizon in the far distance beyond the water rocky hills rise from left to right.Damage, printing error or a light leak has caused a band, most discernible in the centre of the left of the image to appear under-exposed in the print. Graphite appears to have been applied to the print over this area.Inscriptions:Lower left, below image, in pen: ‘Sedab’Upper left, above image, in pencil: ‘a’Lower right, alongside image, in pencil: ‘31’Lower right, below image, in pen: ‘(Jan. 1918)’</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Photograph</genre><subject><topic>Landscape photography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023517952.0x000001#share">Unknown</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
