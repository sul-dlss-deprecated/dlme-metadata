CD - THE BRITISH SUMIvIBR LEGATION A-T QULHEKo General, The village of Gulhek lies seven miles north of Tehran 9 near the foot-hills of the Elburz range and in the district known as Bhimran. It is about 4 ? 500 feet above sea-level and , bout 700 feet above the level of the city. 2 o The first recorded mention of Gulhek as a summer residence of the British Mission to the Court of Persia is contained in a Firman (or Decree) issued by Muhammad Shah in March 1836. This Firman (Annex A.) gives the village to Sir Henry Ellis (Ambassador from July 1835 to August 1836) and all succeeding British Ministers ? to be used when required as their summer quarters. 3 « The Firman also states that the village had been given to Sir Henry's predecessor^ Sir John Campbell (Ambassador from December 1833 to 1834) 9 together with the right of collecting from the villagers an annual tax of 30 tomans (^)(then about £16) «, but no Firman in favour of Sir John Campbell or any previous British representative seems to have ' ved. There is* however* some that Gulhek has been the summer corroborative quarters of the Mission since the summer of 1833 at least. 4. The Firman of 1836 is supplemented by two other documents. One is an order by the Begler-Begi (or Mayor) of Tehran (Annex B.) stating that as the Shah has given Gulhek to the British Ministers as a summer residence and has waived the right of collecting taxes from the village* Government servants are forbidden* by order of the Shah* to interfere with the village in any way; in particular the village is not to be required to furnish recruits or monetary payments in lieu of recruits* or to pay any Government tax. The other is a statement by a certain Abul Kassan (Annex C.) that it is the order of the Shah and the Haji (probably Haji Mirza Aghassi* the Prime Minister) that no demand for taxes shall be addressed to the villagers by any servant of the State. 5. Grants of this kind* called -Tuyul 1 '* by which the Shah assigned the revenues of certain districts to persons whom he wished to favour* were quite common in those days. The adjoining village of Zargandeh was given to the Russian Mission at about the same time* and in the same way* that Gulhek was given to the British Mission. 6 ./ ^ ^This sum apparently represented a tax of 1.25 krans an hour on the water rights belonging to the villagers* rights in irrigation water being calculated in Persia on the basis of a cycle'of 240 hours. As 10 krans (now rials) equal 1 toman* a tax of 1.25 krans for each hour in the cycle would produce 30 tomans. (2) The present Baraidar (or bailiff) of the Legation property has in his possession a receipt for the sum of 30 tomans paid to one Kurban Ali on account of the annual taxes by Rajab (the Baraidar* s great-grandfather)* who v/as then Ketkhoda (or headman)of the village* in July 1833 ( Rabi-ul -Aval * 1249)• According to the Baraidar* Kurban Ali was a Munshi (or writer) and head Ferrash (orderly or office servant) employed by the British Mission*and the receipt is similar in form to others of much later date sealed with the seals of succeeding British Ministers,4o 6 . The guasi-manorial rights thus acquired by the British Mission were usually exercised on behalf of the head of the Mission by the Vice-Consuls who acted through a Ketkhoda chosen from among the villagerSc This position was held by the same family for nearly 100 years* the present Baraidar of the Legation property* Mohammad Ali Beg* who was also the Ketkhoda of the village until 1928 and ia now about eighty* being the fourth generation of his family to hold the appointment. 7«Ths special rights of the British Mission were retained until 1928* but they do not seem ever to have been clearly defined# A minute written by the Vice-Consul in 1900 shows that he concerned himself with in ter alia the provision of a schoolmaster for the village children* the hiring of three policemen from the Minister of Police for the summer season and the cleanliness of the village bath. In 1906 His Majesty*s Legation reported that only British and Persian subjects could hold property in Gulhek* which was a British concession* and addeds 'The basis and the extent of the jurisdiction of the 'British Government are vague and ill-defined* but in 'practice the British Minister exercises the powers of an 'autocrat'. / 8 . In 1927(3) the Legation reported that the rights consisted of; '(a) the registration of all sales and leases of property. '(b) the collection of the following annual taxess a 'house Lax of 1 toman* a sanitary tax of 1 toman* 'a 1 % tax on water rights* a 1/1 tax on transfers of 'real property* a 5/o tax on leases* in return for 'which' the Legation undert ^ h the maintenance of roads 'and bridges* the repair of water-courses* lighting 'and sanitation. '(c) certain undefined proprietory rights* by which the 'villagers enjoyed inviolability of domicile* British 'consular protection and exemption from military 'service'• 9. These taxes must have been collected by prescription rather than by right* as they considerably exceeded the annual tax of 30 tomans mentioned in the Firman of 1836. They were in any case additional to and independent of that tax* which had* moreover* been reduced to 20 tomans in the time of Sir Francis Lascelles (Minister 1891-1894)* and further reduced to 19 tomans in about 1913 as the result of the acquisition from the villagers of certain water rights. 10. The Legation were also responsible in theory for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice, but in 1928 it had already been the practice for many years — probably since the end of the nineteenth century/ 3 (3) There was also correspondence on the subject between the Foreign Office and the Legation in 1884* 1890 and 1905-1906.(3 5o century - to delegate these functions to the Chief of Police of Shimran* 11. The special rights of His Majesty’s Legation were finally surrendered on the 30th July 9 1928&lt;&gt; certain assurances as to the treatment of the villagers 'by the Persian Government 'being embodied in an exchange of notes(4) of the same date whereby the Persian Government undertook^ (1) To honour all duly registered property transactions effected up to July 30th 9 1928. (2) To exempt the village from taxes prior to March 21st 9 1928. (3) To renounce any prosecution for offences committed before July 30th 2 1928 ? unless discovered subsequently. (4) To ensure proper sanitary control of the village and in cases of epidemic disease to consult the Legation physician. The corresponding Russian rights at Zargand^h had been surrended by the Soviet Government in 1921. The Property. 12. For the first twenty years or so after 1836 the Mission appear to have exercised the right cf placing their summer camp in the village 9 but not to have acquired any property of their own. Lady Sheil 9 (5) whose husband was Minister from 1844 to 1853c, wrote of this camp in 1850s 'Ours is certainly a camp on a large scale. We 'have sleeping-tents 9 nursery tents 9 and my private 'sitting room tent* all enclosed in a Ibigh v/all of canvas, 'and forming the anderoon /i.e. inner or women 1 s 'quarters/. Then detached are the dining-tent, drawing- 'room tent and tents for each of the gentlemen of the 'Mission. To me it looks very magnificent, yet I am 'told it is paltry in comparison with the good old times 'that are gone. From the size of these tents, some of 'them being thirty feet in length, their double roofs and 'double walls several feet apart, I had anticipated a 'comfortable residence during the summer. But I am 'disappointed beyond measure, the heat and the dust 'being intolerable.' 13. Some ten years later the Mission had rented a house and garden, for Mr. Eastwick( 6 ),who v/as Secretary of the Legation from 1860 to 1863, wrote of his arrivals 'After/ * 5 6 '^'Persia Prints Part XXV No. 68 . (5) 'Glimpses of Life and Manners in Persia'; 1856; page 162. ( 6 ) 'Journal of a Diplomatics three years residence in 'Persia'; 1865; page 241. This book also contains (pages 221-225) a full account of the old Legation in the south of Tehran, which v/as given up when the present town Legation was built in 1869.'After passing through the centre of Gulhek, a 'village of about 100 houses, I turned to the left up 'a lane, with gardens on each side,. On the left was 'a large garden, now the property of Ismail Khan, ’’paymaster of the forces, and beyond it the garden 'rented by the Missiono I passed into this under 'a mud building.; v^hich I found to be the Chancellerie* 'Close to it a large tent was pitched, in v/hich 'breakfast was laid for the Mission, and beyond this 'was a small mud house, in which Mr» Alison Minister '1860-18727 was lodged o 'After breakfast, I took a survey of the place. 'The garden rented by the Mission seemed to contain 'about three acreso There were a good number of fruit 'trees in it, pomegranates, apple, cherry, and peach 'trees, and some rows of tall poplars. By the northern 'corner was a Yakhchal, a place for making ice. 'Beyond the garden, and sloping up towards the 'Elburz, is an open space, bounded on the right by a 'deep ravine, and on the left by a row of trees, 'terminating in a huge silk cotton~tree( 8 ), very 'conspicuous for a long way round. In this space 'the tents of the attaches, and of the Persian guard, 'some fifty men of one of the Shah’s regiments, were 'pitched. 'At the time of my first visit to Gulhek, the 'position of the Mission there v/as very unsatisfactory. 'Muhammad Shah in 1835 had given over the seignorial 'rights to the English, and the Mission received some '£10 in virtue of this concession, and disbursed double 'the sum in subscriptions for fetes to the villagers, as 'at T©ziyah, or mourning for: the family of Ali.(9) 'It was understood that no one could settle in the village 'without the permission of the English Minister, but it 'seemed to be entirely doubtful whether the Minister 'himself would be able to maintain his footing. The 'garden he rented had belonged to the Imam Jumah, or 'High Priest of Tehran, who left it in vakf, that is, 'for religious purposes, to the trusteeship of one 'Mulla Ali, a bigoted man, by no means partial to Faringis Franks - foreigners/. The lease held by the 'Mission/ (■^This may have stood on the site of the building adjoining the present East Gate of the Legation (House J; see Schedule No. 4) , or possibly at a gate, which has now disappeared, at the eastern end of the road running to the south of the Minister’s house (House A), v/hich formerly extended as far as the eastern wall. ( 8 ) A kind of acacia. There is no such tree in the garden today (1939) (9) These payments were continued up till 1922 or 1923.7 G 5 '•Mission would expire in a year 9 and the Mulla would 'would not revive it except on exorbitant terms* neither 'would he sell vakf land to an infidel* and had he been 'willing to do so* the Persian Government* jealous of 'land passing to foreigners* would not have permitted 'the sale* Some months after* Mr* Alison placed the 'matter entirely in my hands* and it was my good fortune* 'with the help of the chief Persian secretary* to obtain 'all the ground as a free gift to the Mission from the 'Shah'. 14* The property which the Mission acquired through Mr. Eastwick's efforts was bought by the Persian Government from the heirs of the Imam Jumeh for 1635 tomans (say £700). The title deeds (Annex D) were transferred on February 17th* 1862* by one Haji Syed Morteza* acting on behalf of the heirs, to the Persian Government* and by the Persian Government to the British Mission by means of a Firman of Nasr-ed-Din Shah (which cannot now be found) and a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 9th March* 1862 (Annex E)• 15. This property* which is variously stated to have amounted to 16* 17*20 and 21 acres* is shown as Areas Nos. 1 and 2 on the accompanying plan*(10) No. 1 being the 'garden' proper and No. 2 the 'additional lands' to the north of it (see the deed and also Mr. Eastwick f s account). Between the two ran what was until the time of Sir Mortimer Durand (Minister 1894-1900) a public road-way* the western part of which is now the main drive and the eastern part now grassed over. Certain water rights in the kanauts (underground channels)connected with the property were* as usual in Persia* acquired with the property. Two large plane trees (which stand in what is now the garden of the Secretaries 1 house - House D) fifteen willow trees and one mulberry tree were expressly excluded from the grant as being endowed religious property(wakf).(11) The Legation were in addition required to leave room for a public way between the eastern boundary of their property and a stream called the Doolab stream (12) to the east of it. 16. Soon after the property was acquired* several houses were built uoon the southern part of the 'additional 'land^’ (Area No* 2)* which was planted so as to form an extension of the garden* and this part was divided from the northern part - and from the fields outside the property on the west - by a fence called in the contemporary translations of later property deeds the 'palissadery'* much of which is still standing. Beyond this 'palissadery'* a further area was enclosed at some period (probably before 1876) to form a kitchen garden* which still exists in the same position. 17/ nor entitled 'British Legation* Gulheks Acquisitions of Property 1862-1928 '2 drawn in 1939s see Schedule No. 1. (ll) Trees are often* according to Eastern practice* a matter of separate ownership from the land on which they stand. In order to comply with this conditiion the eastern boundary wall was rebiiLt* in 1876* nine feet to the eastwards* thus allowing for the erosion of its'banks by the Doolab stream* which is really what is called in India a nullah.8 17. The subsequent additions to the property are described in Schedule No., 3(13) and only the more important are mentioned below. 18. In 1890 an area to the south of the original property embracing what is now part of the Counsellor's garden and the lower stables 9 together with the right to 42 hours 54 minutes use of the water in the three kanauts of the village 9 was purchased (Annex M) for £700 from Mr. Henry Stagno Navarra 9 a clerk in Her Majesty's Legation 9 and later Consul at Coqimbo and elsewhere. This garden (which is shown as Area No. 5 on the plan), with an adjoining area which was not included in the purchase 9 had formerly been the property of Ismail Khan (see paragraph 13). It was acquired by Sir T .V. Taylour Thomson (Minister 1872-1879), with certain other properties, in order that a road, which for many years bore his name, might be driven through the village, and re-sold by him to Mr. Navarra's father, a British merchant of Tabriz and Tehran. 19. Area No. 6 on the plan, situated at the extreme northern end of the compound and usually called the 'Paichenar property'(14) from two ancient chenars or plane-trees of great size which grow there (l5) ? was granted to the Legation by the Perian Government in 1893 (Annex N) for ninety-nine years together with the use of a certain amount of v/ater from the Serasiab kanaut (see paragraph 26) in return for an undertaking by the Legation not to clean out the eastern branch of the upper end of the Serasiab kanaut, an operation which might have affected adversely the flow of water in another kanaut, called the Ishratabad kanaut, belonging to the Shah. The land could not be granted outright, as it was wakf property, but Mr. (afterwards Sir \7o) Conyngham Greene, the Charge d'Affaires at the time, has left a memorandum with the deed of transfer to the effect that the Persian Government had given him an oral assurance that the grant, though nominally for ninety-nine years only, was intended nevertheless to be perpetual. Nineteen trees situated on this piece of land were purchased separately at the same time (Annex 0 ) from the villagers of Gulhek, who also received an annual payment of 20 tomans as a sort of quit-rent for their rights in the property (16). Some difficulty was encountered when the Legation property was registered/ References to Annexes F. G. H. I. J. K. L and R will be found in this schedule. ^^Also called 'endowed property of Haii Ismail'. (l5) A pipe-seller's ('kalian-farush') shop existed for many years beneath these trees, which are still standing, and here the servants of the British and Russian Legations used often, according to tradition, to meet and fight. There are many traditions attached to these trees, which must be some hundreds of years old. (iS)T'his Payment was made in the form of a deduction of 20 tomans from the sums due each year from the villagers in respect of their share of the cost of cleaning the Serasiab kanaut. A memorandum written by Mr. 7 . A. Smart (the Acting Vice-Consul) on September 25, 1907, shows that these deductions fell into disuse for some years prior to 1907, but were resumed in that year as the result of protests from the villagers.—9. registered in 1934 (see paragraph 25), owing to the claims of the villagers to the ownership of this area, but the matter was eventually arranged satisfactorily,, 20. The area which lies to the south and west of the original property and upon which the houses of the Oriental Secretary (Rouse H) and Surgeon (House P) now stand (shown as Area No. 7 on the plan) v/as at one time the property of Mr, Alison* After his death in 1872 it passed under his will to an Armenian lady, usually called Madame Vartini, who had been his mistress and by whom he had had a daughter called Victoria; and after these two it was usually known as the 'Bagh-i-Khanum' (i.e. Garden of the Lady) or 'Bagh-i- ,, Victoria ,, (Garden of Victoria) . By the year 1893 Madame Vartini had married, and become the widow of, a certain Ivan Kalustoff (sometimes called Haji Ivan), a Russian subject; and on November 10, 1893, she made over the property to Victoria, whom she describes as Victoria Charles Allison and who was at that time married to a certain Ossipoff, also a Russian subject. 21. Victoria Ossipoff died, however, before her mother, leaving minor children. After her daughter’s death Madame Vartini continued to use or let the property during the sunhaer, until in 1905 His Majesty’s Minister, Sir Arthur Hardinge, decided that the time had come to acquire this property for the Legation, partly because it was needed to improve the accommodation for the staff and partly because the Russian Legation showed a tendency to interfere with it on the ground of the nationality of Madame Vartini and her grandchildren. Making use, therefore, of the customary right of His Majesty's Legation to restrict residence in Gulhek to British and Persian subjects, Sir Arthur Hardinge and his successor, Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, eventually succeeded in securing the surrender of the property, at a valuation, by the trustee for Madame Ossipoff’s children. By this valuation the price was fixed at 10,400 tomans (about £1,800) and the purchase was completed in the autumn of 1906 (Annex ?)• 22. In 1913 Area No. 8 , to the west and north-west of the original property, was purchased (Annex q) from the heirs of Haji Mohammed Ja’afar (formerly Kerbalai Mohammed Ja*afar) for 55,533 krans (say £1,000). This area consisted of an open field without trees. It v/as occasionally sown with lucerne but no systematic attempt to plant trees and water it regularly seems to have been made until the time of Sir Reginald Hoare (Minister 1931-1934). 23. A small strip of land adjoining the main Tehran- Tajrish road v/as sold to the Municipality of Tehran on the 15th November, 1928, for the purposes of road-widening, the Municipality paying 18,959,85 krans (3791.97 zars (17) at 5 krans per zar) for the land and 13,800 krans towards the cost of erecting a wall as the new boundary (Annex S). This strip is shown on the plan as Area No. 9 sections (c) and (d). At/ (i?) A square zar is a little larger than a square metre: about 41' x 41'•( 10 . At the same time the Legation flagstaff ? which formerly stood in a triangular plot in the road opposite the main gate 9 was moved to a point inside the gate and to the north of the drive# The wall huilt along the road with the money received from the Municipality 9 in the place of the wooden palisade which had previously stood there, completed the walling in of the property. 24. Since 1928 there have been no changes in the property, v/hich now extends to about 44 acres in all. 25. On the 17th March, 193?, the Persian Government passed a law for the registration of real property and the registration of the whole of the Gulhek compound as the property of His Majesty’s Legation was duly effected in accordance with this law on the 11th November, 1934 (Annex T)• Water supply. 26. The most important attribute of landed property in Persia is the accompanying water rights. When the original property was acquired in 1862 the Legation acquired 12 hours, in a cycle of 240 hours, of the water flowing from two kanauts of which one, called the ”large kanaut” or 'Zargandeh kanaut' (18), came to the surface in the north-west corner of area No. 1 near two large plane-trees (see paragraph 15) and the other, called the ’’small kanaut” or ”kalian-farush kanaut” (and today the ’’Paichenar kanaut”) came to the surface to the north of Area No. 2 close to another pair of large plane-trees (see paragraph 19). In 1890 the Legation acquired through the purchase of Mr. Navarra’s garden (see paragraph 18) the use of 42 hours (in a 240 hour cycle) in these two kanauts, and in a third kanaut, the ’’Seresiab kanaut”, which rises at the extreme northern end of the present property. Additional purchases of shares in the three main kanauts have taken place from the time of the original acquisition to the present day and the Legation now owns in all 85 hours 54 minutes out of every 240 hours. 27. A fourth kanaut is that begun at his own expense by Sir Ronald Thomson (Minister 1879-1882) in the sand-hills north-east of the Legation and called the ”Kanaut-i-Thomson- ”Sahib”• The work was, however, abandoned before its completion owing to complaints by the villagers that it was tapping the water of other kanauts in which they had rights. For many years a part of its channel has been used to carry the water of the ’’Seresiab kanaut” and in 1937 its three upper wells were deepened and cleaned and connected with the ’’Seresiab kanaut”, so that it is now producing a little water on its own. . 28 . / (18) It rises in the property of the Russian Legation (now Embassy) and in the past the Russian Legation have made difficulties about allowing it to be extended.11 . 28. The deeds recording the various purchases of water 9 to the number of thirty four or more, are preserved in the Legation The rights whichthey embody have been the cause of frequent disputes, as it is only to be expected in the case of a form of property which passes through other people’s land, can be purloined with comparative ease and is divided among innumerable shareholders. These rights were specially registeredCI 9 ) in 1939,as they were not included in the registration of the property in 1934 (see paragraph 25)• 29. Apart from the kanauts already mentioned other kanauts, in which the Legation has no property rights, pass through the grounds and come to the surface outside, them. These include the so-called ’'Consul! kanaut”, which was dug in somewhat irregular circumstances in about 1871 by Mr. Ongley, nephew and private secretary to Mr. Alison, and later transferred still more irregularly to an adjoining land-owner by one of the Persian staff.of the Legation who somehow secured access to the official seal. Buildings. 30. The Minister’s house (called House A in the plans and records of His Majesty’s Office of forks V 0 9 the Minister’s stables (now the garages - House P) and certain minor buildings occupied by European or Persian servants (including House 0) are built on the site of the original ’’garden” (Area No. 1); while the Commercial Secretary s house (House B) a small adjacent house (House C - incorporated since 1934 with House B), the Chancery (House M - until 18.4 the Chancery was in the Minister’s house), the Secretaries House (House D), the Registrar’s house (House L) and the Counsul’s House (House E) are built on the site of the original 'additional lands” (Area No. 2). All buildings are shown on Lieutenant Pierson s plan of I 860 (see paragraph 33 below) and were probably already built by then. They are also likely to have been built after 1862 (though a house or houses of some kind stood in Area No. 1 before 1862). House L was originally a gardener s cottage and converted much later. The Surgeon’s house (House P) and Oriental Secretary’s house (House H), as well as two small houses used until 1930 and 1933 respectively as the hospital (House J) and dispensary (House G), all stand on what was formerly the vartini property (Area No. 7). House P was built some time after the property had been acquired in 1906 near the site of an earlier building called 'the Orangery'• House H was built in 1909 and the remainder at any ^atelfter 1906. The Counsellor’s house (House K) was built in 1908, partly on the Vartini property, and partly on the Navarra property.

The buildings at Gulhek were described by Mr. A. Scott 9 of His Majesty’s Office of w 0 rks,in 1920/1921 as being: '..oo.of the ordinary native type in plan and construct ion* with small rooms* primitive in ’’arrangement and poor in finish* The walls generally ’’are of sun-dried brick with burnt brick or rough ’’stone bases* burnt brick pilasters and verandah piers* ’’floors of plaster or burnt brick*( 21 ) roofs of mud with ’’beams exposed internally. The walls are plastered ’’externally* in mud only in some cases and furnished in gypsum in others”. It will be gathered from this description that the houses are of a simple kind* but most of them are nevertheless attractive and adequate specimens of what they are meant to be i.e.^ summer cottages* whose verandahs — and gardens — are their most important features. The simplicity of their construction has the'great advantage that they can be remodelled with comparative ease* and almost all the houses have in fact been enlarged or altered since they were originally built. 32. There are now in various parts of the garden two hard tennis courts* a large blue-tiled open air swimming pool (which was already there in 1876) and a ride* with small jumps* for schooling horses. Plans and Heports. 33. An interesting plan of the original area drawn in 1865 on a scale of 1” to 20 yards by Lieutenant Pierson, R.E. (a member of the Telegraphs Mission who afterwards built the present town Legation) hangs in the Chancery at Tehran. A view of the Minister’s residence is inset showing a flag r staff to the north of it. A full list of this and other plans is given in Schedule No. 1* and a list of reports^ on the property and its kanauts by representatives of His Majesty’s Office of Y/orks in Schedule No. 2. 34. Much more could be written about Gulhek* but to do so lies beyond the scope of the present memorandum* which has been compiled from more or less readily accessible sources of information only and merely aims at showing in outline the development of what has become perhaps one of the/ (217 Or sometimes blue Persian tilesthe finest and certainly one of the pleasantest gardens in Persia* in the hope that it may he of some interest to those who have lived in it in the past or still live here. A complete and entirely accurate account of the property could only he compiled after a careful examination of the archives of the Mission* the Foreign Office and the Office of Works at the material times* hut that is a task which must await some future historian.

Apart from the small size which had to be adopted, and the fact that the reproductions are not printed from half-tone blocks, the inadequacy of these reproductions is most evident in the case of Nos. 5 and 60 No. 5 (which shows the dates at which the different parts of the Legation property were acquired from 1862 onwards) is intended to be reproduced on transparent paper, so that it can be used in connexion with No. 6 (which shows the Legation as it is today). Although it has not been possible to arrange this in the present edition, it is to be hoped that it will be arranged in a future edition. The original drawings from which Nos. 5 and 6 have been made are kept with the draft of the memorandum in the Foreign Office archives.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0003b4_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/448</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0003b4</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/448</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 6584/40 'The British Summer Legation at Gulhek.
