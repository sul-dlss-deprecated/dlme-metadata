For a long time we have been trying to obtain a printing press which will be used for printing Government forms and also for printing a Government Gazette or a local newspaper. I feel that the need for this is now really urgent. T* T e have at present no effective means of counteracting the increasing amount of mischievous political propaganda which is being directed against not only the Bahrain Government but the British Government;. If we had some sort of official news sheet we could publish statements and statistics which the public should know. 2. We have on order a secondhand printing press - we tried to obtain a new one but the shortest time for delivery was five years. We are buying it through Charles Kendall who is also trying to obtain Arabic type. It appears to be very difficult to obtain such type and I have today received a telegram from Kendall saying though many enquiries are in progress early delivery cannot be promised. The press is due to arrive here in about two months. 3. in view of our urgent need for Arabic type would it be possible for you to use your influence with the authorities in England to expedite the supply of Arabic type.Telephone No. Whitehall 5140.

J &lt;2^93. A Dear Mr.Harrison, t I refer to the Express Le tter No.2285-80/B3 of Slat October from Bahrein, which was repeated to this Department. In answer to paragraph 2, firms may purchase goods as shown on the attached list direct from Japanese suppliers, names of whom may be obtained from the Boeki-Gho, Tokyo (the Japanese Board of Trade). Goods subject to international allocation and also 9t the 1947 crop' tea, silk and cotton textiles are sold on a Government to Government basis through official purchasing missions in Japan. Inports into Japan are made mainly on Government account. The United Kingdom has a purchasing mission in Japan which undertakes a certain amount of trade for Colonial Governments otherwise unrepresented there, but I do not know how Bahrein fits in with this# Traders may visit Japan to make purchases for a period of 3 weeks. The am&amp;ll number of business visitors allowed in is 400, of which the United Kingdom and the Colonies are allowed to send 64 between them# At present there is no exchange rate for the yen so that prices of goods are fixed in dollars and payment is made to /the Office, Downing S treet, S.W.I.,the Boeki-Cho, who in turn pay the Japanese supplier in yen. Purchases from the sterling area are at present paid for in sterling convertible into dollars at 6 months intervals. Japan is therefore treated as a hard currency market. . 7. . 'Jfc 1 As regards paragraph 3, since prices of Japans^*; j^oods are based on nited States current prices, our experience is that they are much dearer than was expected. Very little trade is accomplished even by firms on the spot,* so I doubt if there ^ill be much scope for Bahrein. Yours sincerely # L.

Dear Sirs, We thank you for yotir letter or the 16th Ultimo addressed to us under our formeUnited Exporters Ltd. and dealing with the question of supplies of soap for your market In reply we have to inform you that in common with other soap manufacturing concerns our Bombay associates have been affected by the acute world shortage of raw materials. They have found it increasingly more difficult to maintain production at a sufficient level for their own domestic needs and cannot obviously make any allocation for export. There seems little likelihood of any change in this position for some time to come and in the circumstances they have been requested to refer to us all matters concerned with the supply of soap to your Market. Unfortunately, as you are no doubt aware, the export of soap from this country is prbhibited except under licence and so far as Kuwait is concerned to export quota has been established for this year and there seems very little prospect of one being granted. We regret that there is no action we can take here and it is preferable that any approach in this matter should be sponsored in the market itself. We suggest, therefore, in view of the curtailment of Indian supplies and our inability to ship from here under existing arrangements that you put the position before your own authoirites leaving the to place the matter before the Board of Trade for consideration. We have not yet heard from your Principals, Messrs. Brown John and Howard Ltd.,London, but we will no doubt be receiving a commimication from them during the course of the next few days and will acquaint them of the position. We are anxious not to lose the trdde which has been developed in our specialty lines in your market and we, therefor look forward to your further news on this subiect with some interest.

As regards the allocation of cotton textiles to the Persian. Gulf, I have just attended a meeting today of Government Committee which has decided that country-wifle allocations of cotton textiles shall be given up.

Dear Thomson, I refer to your letter to Mr. Ellis of the 12th September with reference to the new generating sets which the Kuwait Electric Supply Company have ordered from Messrs. Ruston and Hornsby and Crompton Parkinson, Ltd. In this connection I an advised by the Kuwait Oil Company that whilst they know of the above Supply Company they are not at the present tirjie, interested in taking supplies of electric power from them mainly on account of the fact that the latter can only'supply direct current whereas the Jil Company operate entirely on alternating current and for this reason have installed their own generating equipment to supply their houses and hospital at Kuwait. t Insofar as their actual oil operations are concerned these are located too far from Kuwait to justify the purchasing of current from so small a supply company even werq/he latter in a position to provide A.C. current. The position is,.therefore, that whilst the Kuwait Oil Company may conceivably at some future date and when alternating current is available, consider taking current from the Supply V. Thomson, Esq., 4, Central Buildings, Mathew Parker Street, S.W.1* /Companyt Company for their houses in Kuwait in order to save the cost of ope'rating their own generating plant there, they are of operating their own generating plant there definitely not interested at the present time, . For this reason ; I an afraid I do not see how we can, with any justifi^^ion, : intervene on your behalf with Ruston and Hornsby, I an sorry we cannot assist you in the matter for I know from my own experience how badly the latter Company’s deliveries have fallen off of late. Before concluding I would like to suggest.that Ministry of Supply Directorate of Disposals at Great Westminster House not infrequently have for disposal generating units of around the size which the Kuwait Company require, in fact, I believe jchey have some 150 K,V. sets in hand at the present time. If the Company's need is urgent, it may be worth their while to consider something of this sort if only as a temporary measure. Yours sincerely. C,H.

LOiiDON FOKEIGN NEW DELHI POLITICAL KUWAIT Reference In connection v/ith the scheme to iastal a nev a. C. electric supply in Kuwait in place of the existing j. C. system, the Kuwait Electric Supply Company, Limited, placed orders early this year with Messrs. Huston and Hornsby and Crompton Parkinson Limited, for two new 175 Kilowatt machines, with alternators, switch board and other accessories. Firms accepted orders and promised delivery in January or February, 1947, so that new system could be in operation in Kuwait before tne summer of 1547. The Kuwait Electric Supply Company, Limited, have, however, now been informed by the manufacturers that they can effect delivery only after eighteen months, which means that the new plants will not be available in Kuwait for the summer of 1947, while it is also doubtful whether they will be in operation before the summer of 1948. It is also learnt unofficially that the price originally quoted has since been increased by about 20 per cent. 2. In view of the fact that the existing plant in Kuwait is inadequate to meet present demands - and demands will increase with the expansion of the Oil Company - grateful for any assistance that you could render in getting the firms to give a higher priority to these orders and to effect delivery early in 1947/as originally promised. = BRITAIN = G.A.M.

We have now heard that in so far as the supply of these 10 tons of tin ingots are concerned, it is considered that the simplest method of meeting this requirement is to ask the Tin Committee in Washington to make a special allocation for this amount and that a cable has been sent to Washington to this effect. If the Tin Conmittee, which is an ad hoc Committee set up at the end of 1945 to carry on in respect of tin the functions of the now deceased Combined Raw Materials Board, agree to make this allocation, the proolem of these 10 tons will be solved* For the future it seems likely that, so long as there is a tin shortage and the Tin Committee continues to function, a similar special allocation will be required if the occasion arises. It would, be necessary for the Political Resident to cable separate recommendations in each case. I imagine, however, that cases are likely to be infrequent, and I think you can safely ^assrtjre the Political Resident that the delay in the present case (which n&amp;gpt be regarded as finally settled until we hear that the allocation has been made) is exceptional and not likely to recur when the drill is understood all round* Yours sincerely.

I apologise again for being so slow about this. In January, 1945, we made a special release of 10 tons of cotton to cover supplies of piece goods to the Persian Bulf. At that time there were a number of outstanding recommendations from the Political Resident, and though, as you know, these recommendations were simply shipping priorities and did not guarantee that supplies would be forthcoming, we agreed to release a quantity which seemed sufficient to give these recommendations clearance. In addition, in May, 1945, approximately 1 ton was supplied to the Persian Gulf £rem stock held by one of the normal exporters to that area. (The same firm has supplied from stock on several previous occasions). A further special release of 5 tons was made for the Persian Gulf in September, 1945, to clear more outstanding Political Resident's recommendations. I I am not sure, incidentally, exactly what your interest is in this: am I to understand that the Indian Supply Commission have undertaken the responsibility for this area? Yours sincerely, (Signed) Marion Ward. G.R.Morley, Esq., The High Commissioner for India, India Supply Commission, 45/47, 'Mount Street, W.1.February, 194^ isz\ I.S.C. 1684 Miss M. Ward, Board of Trade, Millbank, I^ .on. 5.W.1. j } De * Mss Ward, In your letter CRT ,17/^ dated 28th January, about cotton textiles for Bahrein, you asked whether the India Suppily Conmission have undertaken the responsibility for the Persian Gulf area. We are now sponsoring such demands for the Persian Gulf as require official support. We have taken over from the India Office work in connection -with supplies for ).ndia and this arrangement has been extended to cover supplies to the Persian Gulf also. The former procedure whereby Imports to the Persian Gulf were covered by Essentiality Recommendations issued by the Political Resident and endorsed by the. Government of India, followed by a letter of shipping support issued by the India Office, was dis-continued as from the 14-th December, 1945* An announcement to this effect appeared in the Board of Trade journal where it was stated that applications for Export Licences should henceforth be made to the Export Licensing Department and not to the India Office. V/e do not therefore consider it to be likely that except perhaps in exceptional cases, we shall have to undertake sponsorship of individual orders for the Persian Oulf. There may, however, be cases of a more general nature where help is required to obtain certain supplies for the Persian Gulf and in these cases we shall do what we can to help. The present case of cotton textiles for Bahrein is an instance. The shortage of cotton textiles has been brought to our notice in connection with Bahrein only, and n\y original enquiry to was confined to Bahrein, which is for this purpose probably the most important of the Persian Gulf territories. It seems likely that conditions similar to those in Bahrein would prevail in the other territories and our further efforts migjit therefore be directed towards improving supplies for all the Persian Gulf territories rather than for Bahrein only. It seems to me fairly clear that the releases for the Persian Gulf area mentioned in your letter have not been sufficient to meet legitimate requirements. I enclose a copy of a letter dated 23 rd November to Mr. Dalrymple- Belgrave, Advisor to the Bahrein Government, explaining the difficulties encountered and stressing the inadequacy of supplies. We are, of course, unable to make supplies available from the allocation of cotton textiles for export to India. This allocation is intended to meet the needs of India alone - incidentally it is inadequate for the purpose - and is confined to special qualities whereas I imagine the needs of the Persian Gulf area are for a general range of textiles. I should be grateful for your views as to whether it wauld be advisable to ask the Textile Sub-Committee for a special allocation for the Persian Gulf, or whether you 'would be abl^ to meet these requirements by special releases as heretofore. Perhaps it would be as well if we were to obtain an estimate of the probable requirements from the Political Resident whether or not there is to be formal allocation but before telegraphing for an estimate I should be glad to have your views• As a measure of immediate relief could you arrange with the Cotton Board for releases to cover any outstanding orders from the Persian Gulf and in particular from Bahrein. As I have already explained, current orders from these territories are not necessarily covered by Essentiality Reconniendations. I am sending a copy of this letter to Hamersley.

Dalyrimple Belgrave Esq., C.B.E., LONDON. Dear Mr. Belgrave, I would like to confirm a conversation I had with you in London, in which I explained the difficulty which we are experiencing in arranging shipments of Textiles to Bahrein. From the “beginning of the War, it has “been most difficult to satisfy the requirements of this market. In the first place, the Authorities on this side did not apparently take into consideration the fact that there was such a territory as Bahrein, and for many months there was confusion as to whether this territory should come under the jurisdiction of the M.E.S.C. or the India Office. Ultimately it was decided, and rightly so, that Bahrein came under the jurisdiction of the India Office. From that time, difficulties were to a certain extent simplified, as in so far as cotton and woollen textiles were concerned, it was agreed that if our clients could secure a recommendation from the Political Resident in Bahrein, and same was supported hy the Indian Government at New Delhi, a Letter of Shipping Assistance would ultimately he issued to us by the India Office in London. As however this procedure entailed delays of several months, you can appreciate the difficulties with which both we and our clients were confronted, particularly as even when the India Office Letters of Shipping Assistance were in our possession, it still remained to secure goods which could be exported to this particular market. Between 1942 and 1944 the Cotton Board were agreeable, under instructions from the Board of Trade, to pemit shipments of Cotton Textiles which had been produced in this Country prior to the allocation system coming into force, (The aDbcation systemMr, C.Dalyfimple Belgrave.(Oontd.) - 2 - 23 . 11 . 45 , came into force early in 1941 ) t&gt;ut as no raw material was released, it meant that the only goods that could be shipped were those stocks which were available&gt; and which the manufacturers were prepared to dispose of without obtaining replacement. As, hov/ever, the Cotton Board themselves were offering replacement against any stocks offered to them to be utilised for Relief Shipments to various territories, you can readily understand the impossibility of securing any substantial weight for our Bahrein customers. Throughout this period we were, and still are, receiving Letters of Shipping Assistance from the India Office, covering many tons of Textiles, but from where are these goods to be obtained? p r om the end of 1944, it is true the Cotton Board agreed to issue an allocation to ourselves and other recognised exporters for the Bahrein market, but the total quantity is negligible compared with essential needs of this market. In fact the only raw material that has so far been released to us, and we fully believe that we have received the bulk of the allocations for this market, are as follows:* November.1944* Approximately 4 t ons. February. 1945* ' 2 ' With this small weight it is of course quite impossible to satisfy the demands of our friends in this market, or for that matter, to re-establish these qualities of Lancashire Piece Goods, whichwere so well liked by the Bahrein native population in the past. We firmly believe that the native population is being caused considerable hardship on account of the lack of supplies from this Country, and although we have repeatedly heard arguments put forward by the Authorities on this side that Bahrein can and should be supplied by India, we know from our own experience that it is quite impossible for India to manufacture those specified lines which are an intrinsic part of Bahrein^ requirements. We would ask you, therefore, to t ake this matter up with the India Office, as we firmly believe that tf the necessary In passing, we would mention that whilst certain territories came under the jurisdiction of the M.E.S.C. no such difficulties in covering for these market*s requirements were experienced. In fact, on receipt of a U.K.C.C. Confirmation of a Priority A. Import Licence, the Cotton Board on this side automatically released sufficient yarn to cover the weight stated on the Import Licence in question, If the same procedure had been adopted in regard to Bahrein, and India Office Letters of Shipping Assistance considered on a par with U.K.C.C. Confirmations, then no such difficulties as the above would have been experienced.^Dalyrimple Belgrave (Contd,*) - 2 - /SV 23 . 11 .45* nnt)roach is made to the Commercial Relations and Treaties of the Board of T rade, they will realise that the . ahrein mar^e is not receiving equitable treatment. V/e make this statement knowing full well the enormous demands which are being mace fro-n all quarters of the world on Lancashire at the present time. We feel, however, Bahrein is tein ? n e S^ ect ®^ v° ^ fnct. that it has not in the past been considered sufficiently important lo warrant the personal attention which in our opinion it fully deserves. In so far as your own requirements are concerned, we would explain°that there is little possibility of being able to satisfy same, unless an allocation is given to us y Board to enable the production of the qualities m qu s We would, therefore, suggest that you ask the office to make this position clear to the Authorities oh this side, as we are convinced that if the Board of Trade will support the applications made to them by the India Office, the Cotton Board will then receive the necessary authorisation to r elease the raw material to us.

I Dear Chaudhari, With reference to our telephone conversation this morning, I enclose herewith the papers regarding supply of goods to the Persian Gulf territories with which you have agreed to deal in the sazae way as our S. &amp; 0. Department dealt with them previously. Yours sincerely. P.C. Chaudhari, Ssq., India Supply Cotinission, 45-47 iiount Street, W.l.The work which the E. &amp; 0. Department has hitherto been performing in connection with the supply of goods to India has 'been transferred v/ith effect from 5th November to the India Supply Commission. The staff engaged on this work in the E. &amp; 0. Department has either been transferred to the ISC or dispersed to other Departments. Miss Packer is now a member of the staff of the ISC and wrote her note to you in that capacity. On the shipping side our existing organisation will be maintained until shipping control disappears. 2. We had it in mind that these changes will involve an alteration of the existing procedure for dealing with supplies to territories outside India in which you are interested. Prance tells me that he mentioned this matter to Cleary about a month ago, suggesting that the latter should make arrangements with Chaudhuri (the head of the ISC) as to the manner in which these cases should be handled in the futdre. Miss Packer before her transfer had also raised the matter with Ferris. 3. In view of your note I have discussed the matter with Chaudhuri. He has agreed:- (a) As regards the supply of goods to the Persian Gulf territories (i.e. allocations and export licences) the ISC will be ready to stand in the same relation to the External Department as the S. &amp; 0. Department has done hitherto). (b) As regards supplies to Afghanistan and Nepal the ISC will be ready to advise the External Department on points which you refer to them in the same way as the E. &amp; .0. Department have advised inIff i ' - '♦'it* f (*• V s' ' &gt;. the oast. I have no doubt that Chaudhuri would actually he ready to do more, iut I imagine that for political reasons you would prefer the External Department actually to conduct the correspondence as regards Afghan and Nepalese supplies, as it might he a little inappropriate for this to he done hy a body responsible directly to the Government of India through the High Commissioner. I suggested that you or someone in the External Department gets in touch with Chaudhuri and settles details. i\ As regards the shipment ol goods (as dis tinct from their supply;, this is still being dealt with in the S. &amp; 0. Department (Mr. Gordon) and to enable goods to the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan etc. to be shipped, we are still issuing OP letters on the recommendation of whoever is responsible for sponsoring the goods (the Resident in the case of the Persian Gulf and your Department in the case of Afghanistan). We hope however that it will he possible to simplify this procedure almost immediately and I shall be sending a separate reference on this to your Depart;'en.. vMr. Harrison. (External Department) I understand that as the work previously performed by the E. &amp; 0. Department of the India Office has now been transferred to the India Supply Commission, which i s a Branch of the High Commissioner's Office, the External Department will in future be dealing with cases arising out of supply of goods to the Persian Gulf territories. The India Supply Commission will be available for advice on general supply matters. The present arrangements for the Persian Gulf are that all goods being sent to that area have to be covered by a recommendation issued by the Political Agent in the Persian Gulf. These recommendations are sent to the E. &amp; 0. Department, Shipping Section (Mr. Clarkson) who notify the United Kingdom firms concerned that the recommendation has been issued. Normally once this has been done there is no further difficulty over the supply of the goods as a Political Agent's recommendation is recognised as being a proof of essentiality. In the case of some goods, however, mainly textiles, it is necessary for export licence applications to be sponsored by the India Office. The position ofLtextiles for the Persian Gulf is difficult in that no allocation of rayon (art silk) or cotton has been made for those territories. This means that the Cotton Board will not grant replacement of the art silk or cotton yam used in the manufacture of goods to be supplied to the Persian Gulf and consequently manufacturers will not undertake orders. The only way in which the cotton or rayon goods can be sent out is where the exporters can lay their hands on stocks of goods for which the manufacturers do not require a replacement allocation. We should, therefore^ not sponsor export licence applications for cotton or rayon goods unless it is clearly /stated■■■■ ■1 ■ I stated that no replacement of the cotton or art silk yarn used in their manufacture is required. In the case of woollens there is a small allocation of wool for the manufacture of woollen piecegoods for the Persian Gulf. For the current period which ends on 31st V January 1946 the allocation is 10,000 lb. The Wool iibroort Group have already notified us that the whole of this allocation has been taken up by export licences issued against our sponsorship and consequently no further export licence applications should be sponsored until next Februaiy. ihe addresses of the Departments concerned in the allocation of cotton, woollen and rayon are as follows The Wool Export Group, Export Advisory Section, Commerce House, Bradford (Mr. A.Shephearde is the man to contact). The Cotton Board, Manchester, who not only look after cotton but also rayon. ( Mr. Hammersley is the man to contact.^) There is also the Board of Tinde. For cotton and rayon Mr. R.nV.Riddet and Miss Ward of the Commercial. Halations and Treaties Department of the Board of Trade, Millbank, S.W.1. For wool, Mr. A.Cairn^Cross of the same Department. In the case of the attached application from Gray, Dawes &lt;&amp; Co., since the goods are not already manufactured and will therefore require replacement allocation we should not sponsor to the Cotton Board but should tell the firm that there is no allocation of cotton available for the Persian Gulf and consequently we are unable to sponsor.INWARD TELE Allotted to B.&amp; 0.Department CYPHER TELEGRAM (O.T.P .)

This is already position for IJorth America. 2. Import assistance recommendation procedure has thus already lost all purpose and must be abolished very soon. But it would be desirable to avoid gap between its abolition and imposition of whatever nev? arrangements are decided upon to control expenditure of hard currencies by Persian Gulf State’. 3. I should like to have by 1st ITovemb.er rec-oi Amend a t ions from Political Resident as to means of preventing import into Persian Gulf States from hard currency countries of good*’ except those which are both essential and unobtainable in sterling areas. Presumably import,licensing control could be set up, in Bahrein without difficulty, restricted to items of which some, part of Bahrein's requirements might be met from Europe or America, with open general licences for goods originating from sterling rrsa of- neighbouring countries, e*£, Persia or oaudi Arabia. If similar arrangement is difficult in other Persian Gulf States, can same result be achieved by other means e.g., control over remittances? 4. Six monthly programmes are no longer required for shipping purposes but they may provide us with information with . which to stimulate interest of United Kingdom exporters in Persian Gulf States. 5. Govt.of India may like to discuss this with Thomson who can be contacted through Industries and Civil Guppliee Dept. inieeion (by f erry command). ^ Copies J.F.

Assistance recouimendation should apply also to postal parcels. For pharmaceutical goods procedure recommended paragraph 6 may be followed subject to limit of tonnage allotted in 6 monthly programme. 2.

Request cannot at present be complied with in the absence of quota for yarn to Arab*Sheikhdoms. As however Political Resident considers assistance essential to maintenancs of good relations with tribes and to obviate possibility of Sultan of Muscat turning to Americans for help, we should be grateful if an allocation for this purpose could be provided within over all quota for second half of 1945.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0000b1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1010</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0000b1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1010</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 3373/45 ‘Civilian requirements for Persian Gulf, including Kuwait’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1945/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-03-24T09:54:54</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (176 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 177; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence related to the supply of raw materials and various manufactured goods to the Persian Gulf – primarily Bahrain and Kuwait – following the Second World War (1939-1945).
