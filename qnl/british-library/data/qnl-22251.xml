The Residency Agent informs me that even the job of burning out the eyes was not done efficiently; two of the victims can still see, and have left lor India lor treatment.’ Sh. Sa'id has been trying very hard to jnduce Sh. mujrin to return to Debai from Sharjah; but the latter is not going. Sh. S£ ' id is revenging himself' by refusing to allow Sh. kujrin’s followers to remove- their ' bar as t is” from Debai' On the second day of my visit to Dtbai, the Sheikha sent her m&lt; n to c sk me to oblige her with a little poison, as the rats had been gna»- ing her vegetables. It is.not known for what 'rats' the poison was intended, as I thought it inadvisable to hasten the workings of Providence in this way. On Oct. 2$st. Sh. Sa'id went inland for some 20-3C miles in order to meet Sh. Mohamad bin Ali and arrange for whet he ingenuously nescribed to me as the 'pacification ofi the- hinterland', obviously with special reference to his cousins. Th* meeting, however, came to nothing, cS Sh. ...oxharned «e 6 down with fever. Conversations are, however, to oe r t sumt-d. The Residency Agent has information that some ol the Decal refugees are camped only a few miles inland, and that Rashid bin Huraiz (certainly) and Sa'id oin Buti (very prooably) have visited Sharjah by night in the last week. I assume tkat they have a fair number of followers, as bn. Sa'id does not go out to scotch them. He even thought it necessary to send four guards with me when 1 returned by camel to Sharjah, parsing0 , © Just round the head of Deb&amp;i creek.

Sheikh Sulten was very friendly, took me shooting and telked freely. He wishes to have the Kalba incident forgiven end forgotten, though he is still hankering after an assurance that he will be 'safe” on a wax snip. I took the opportunity to point out the impropriety of such a request. He is thinking hard about the oil concession, and is, in my opinion, in very much the frame of mind to come to terms, if the Coy. chose to exert a little pressure. He wanted to insert a clause making all disputes involving employees oi the Company, subject to Shera* law. I have tried to make him see that juridical matters are no concern of a commercial body, and that the Resident would almost certainly not approve of their signing such a clause. The only embarassmeitt of the visit occurred when he sent me his Jubilee medal as a token of his undying esteem and affection.' 3 * Xs 1 Pc .

He was accompanied by his Assistant Oriental secretary, Mr. M.Xxa Man. He was taken round and shown as much as possible in view of the local hostilities. On. March 8th. he oassed SharjdL again in the Up Mail . l went off to the ship, and arranged to bring him ashore ahd show him something of Dufcai on the next morning; but this was prevented by the ship sailing earlier than hallexpected Dubai/Sharjah * (i) The hostilities continued spasmodically until March 10th. By that time, I noticed that the ammunition belts of many Sharjah supporters were only half full; while Dubai .were using old nails etc. sewn up in gunny to take the place of the cannon balls they had shot away. One of their cannon burst at the breech, but apparently injured no-one. The only incident of interest was on the night of March 6th./7th. , when a raid was made on Sheikh Mani 1 s sangar in an attempt to capture him. (ii) On the evening of March 9th. the Sheikh of Kas al xhaimn arranged a three months* truue , the official idea being that this interval should be used to make permanentarrangements for the residence pf the Dubai exiles» a more correct description would be to say that three weeks * fighting had found the limit of the±x warlike enthusiasm of both sides.

Political Officer/lrucial Coast.Trueial Coa s t Report for th e period ending 30th Nova^ub e r 1940* 1« Movements of political Officer,Trueial Coastc (i) On 20th Novonber I visited Shaikh Shakhbut cf Abu Dhabi, staying in the Guest House. The Shaikh seemed very friendly and was intoractad very much in events, both saitvil and large, in the outside world. I returned in the evening of 21st November. (ii) On 27th November I visited Shaikh /hraad ofUm-al- Qaiwain. (iii) On 30th November, accompanied by Mr.Adaia, Superintend ent British Overseas Airways Corporation, i visited Shaikh Sultan of Has al Khaimah. There had recently been rain in this district and the change to a comparatively green scenery was 'Guest House” close by the garden of the late Khan Bahadur •Isa* The 'Guest House' was really a double storeyed bam, cows and goats being tethered in the ground floor and ourselves on the first storey. The next clay we combined a visit to Khat with a small sandgrouso shoot. Sandgrouse in this area are completely unafraid of a motor car and the ' tartib ' was as follows. The former*a ' box »* and we stood, or rather swayed, in the back of it. The truck was then driven to within 10 yards of the birds, whereupon the Shaikh would poke his gun out of the window and getting at least three birds in one line, would slaughter, with masterly precision,at least two as they sat. v f e v/ould uhen endeavour to bring down some more on the wing. Our total bag was Dubai issued an order, prohibiting his townspeople from going most refreshing. The Shaikh appeared very pleased to see us ana though I had taken a tent, insisted on our staying in his Shaikh and Khan Sahib f AOdur Razzaq sat in the front of the 20 . The Shaikh accompanied us on our return the next oay and went on to Dubai, where he still is. 2 o Local Affairs ♦ Curfew at Dubai. on 20th November the Shaikh of i out /2 - out at night after S’oclock Arabic* It appears that the Shai*w of the ’Awamir met Shaikh Jura*ah of Dubai and oold him that he had seen some wandering Bedus, who said they had been given rifles by Shaikh Mani 1 * This so frightened Shaikh Jum’ah that he immediately jumped to the conclusion that an attack by sea from Bahrain was imminent l and though Shaikh Sa*id was not in favour of it, the curfew order was promulgated. (ii) About the 15th November, Shaikh Ahmad of Diba Hisin went to see Shaikh Humaid, nephew of Shaikh Khalid, Regent of Kalba, at Kalba and complained that the Shahuh of Bai f ah(Diba) were interfering in his internal affairs to such an extent that their Shaikh had actually heard cases in the Hisin area* Shaikh Humaid told him that he should first consult Shaikh «M* - Khalid who was then at Ajman* At the same time Shaikh Humaid sent 50 men to reinforce the guard; at Diba* After Shaikh Ahmad had left for Ajman the Shahuh started cutting and destroying trees in the Hisin area. While on their way back one night from such a raid they were fired at by the Hisin garrison and three were killed and three wounded. As a result of this, tension between the parties increased and sniping continued day and night The Shahuh sustained six killed and three wounded and Salim bin Abdullah the chief of the Naqbiyin and a few others of the Qawasim were wounded* Shaikh Muhammad of Fujairah has been to Diba and has arranged an armistice which ends on 5th December. At the same time he wrote to the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah inviting him to Diba to help in arranging a permanent peace. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah suggested to the Shaikh of Fujairah that a permanet settlement should be made on the basis of 1 Dafin f (r®~ nouncing all claims), failing which a truce for a period of one year, so that he (Ras al Khaimah) with the help of Fujairah might be able in the summer to make a permanent peace. When trouble first broke out the Shahuh wrote to the Shaikh /Shaikh of Dubai for ammunition but he refused to give iham any, saying that he himself needed all his supplies* But he also wrote to Shaikh Huraaid and the Shaikh of the Shahuh asking them to cease hostilities and promised to go to Diba after he had returned from Abu Dhabi where ha went on 23th November to pay a courtesy visit and to strengthen friendly relations 0 The Shaikh of Sharjah had a secret meeting with Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad in his gardens on the 28th November and it is rumoured that he gave 2000 rounds of aiomuniiion as his contribute ion against the Shahuh. The Shaikh of Has al JChainah was also invited to attend the meeting but excused himself by saying he was sick, which was, as it happened, quite true. The Regent of Ka.lba left Ajinan for Kaiba on 30th Noveml -er and has not returned. 3. Air Raid Precaution s at Sharjah. Although the possibility of an air attack on -Oie fort at Sharjah is very remote, air raid precautions are being taken. The Company have ordered 6,000 sand bags ana I have organised, our resources, a icr both passive protection active defence. V/hen the Royal Air Force passed through here the other day, they made a mock low flying bombing and machine attack on the fort, isvery efiort v/as made to take us by surprise but our look out gave the warning in sufficient time for the fort to bo evacuated and defensive positions occupied. The Commander Royal Air Force expressed the view that the arrangements, under all the circumstances, were satisfactory and the most that could be expected. 4. ^JBath er for week endin g 25th November • Average Maximum 84 0 H Minimum 64 o Maxiirum Humidity 98 % Rainfall 0.80 M Political OfmerTfrucdal Coast.Y j No. C/957 - 8/25 Political Agency, Bahrain, 9th December 1940.

The past fortnight has been occupied by two unusually interesting events, the visits of Lieut-Colonel J.Rooney,I.M.S. and of Major J.R.McCrindle,M.C.,Director General of the Overseas Department of British Overseas Airways Corporation® I have not there fore been able to do any real touring and the events connected with the visits of the above are reported under separate paragraphs in this diary® 2. Visit of Lieut-Colonel J.Rooney,I.M.S. Colonel Rooney arrived in Sharjah on 7th December and stayed in the Airways Fort. On 9th December we called on the Shaikh of Dubai ana discussed the new hospital. The result of these discuss ions has been reported separately. We then called on the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah who was staying in Dubai. It was perhaps a fortunate coincidence that both Shaikhs had bad colds but after acting on Colonel Rooney’s advice and, taking some of his medicines they are now recovered* On 10th December we called on the Shaikh of Sharjah. He was in good health. Colonel Rooney left for Bushire by slow mail on 14th Decem ber. 3* Visit of Director General of the Overseas Department of the British Overseas Aorways Corporation* Major J.R.McCrindie,M.C. passed through Dubai by flying boalg from India on 6th December. It was arranged that those Shaikhs | more intimately interested in commercial aviation should meet him at the Flying Boat base* Accordingly the Shaikhs of Dubai, Sharjah and Has al Khaimah, accompanied by Shaikhs Rashid and Jum’ah and many 38-lowers, came to meet him. While we were waiting for the Westbound Flying Boat, the Eastbound arrived with General Hutton ( late Commander,Baluchistan District) and Capuain Gray, R.N. on board. These Officers who had jp.st left England, were in uniform and I took the opportunity of introducing our local rulers to them. The interest arising from this unusual meeting was mutual. That evening the Superintendent and I entertained these Shaikhs /Sh&amp;ikhs, their relatives and friends to dinner• Shaikh Sa*id was however indisposed and unable to attend. Twenty of us sat down to dinner and after dinner, the rather old but apparently perennially interesting 16 mm. films dn charge of Airways were again shown, nt the same tine, in the next room, exactly 70 Shaikhly followers were polishing off the scraps on the rich men f s table. 4. Local Affairs - Diba. As already reported, the trouble at Diba has been settled on a basis of Dafin through the good offices of the Shaikh of Fujairah and the Muscat authorities* j.he Shaikh oi Dubai did not interfere, as he originally intended^and in fact^when I suggested the matter was already in capable nands, seemed only too pleased to have the excuse not to undertake a long and wearisome journey. 2 j5 Weather for week ending. 12 th Dec ember o Average maximum 00 o • o Average minimum 55.50 Highest maximum CO CO • 0 Lowest minimum 52.° Highest Humidity 96 % Rainfall Nile Although there has been a distinct drop in temperature,the weather is not at all bracing.

The messengers also brought one camel from All bln Abdullah as a mark of respect to the Government to compensate for the loss of the articles which could not be found or recovered. The Residency Agent returned the camel with a verbal message thanking All bin Abdullah for his efforts and demanding at the same tine in the strongest terras the recovery of the money (fo. 525/-) and the 'Quwad' of the culprits as a plnishment to them which will act as a deterrent to others. He gave them time till Monday February 5th failing which action would be considered against 3ani Q a tab's tribe as a whole. 'Qawacfl is a great thing to tribes and in very few serious cases the tribe agrees to apply '^uwad' doctrine and make the culprit submit to it. In spire ot intrigues by some of the people of the Trucial Coast to upset the Bani Qatab about our intention, Shaikh Muhammad bin All who was sick sent a special messenger to All bin Abdullah to act as demanded by the Residency Agent at once. On Monday morning 5th February, All bin Abdullah accompanied by 14 6f the leaders of the Masa'id sub-section of Bani gatab brought the five culprits to the Residency Agent without arms or camels. The Commanding Officer was informed *t once who came to the Agency accompanied by his Adjutant and Sgt. Johnson of the Royal Air Force Police. The culprits denied having taken any money and asked to be shown the place from which the money was alleged to have been taken. The Commanding Officer and his Staff accompanied by the Residency Agent, Ali bin Abdullah and the five culprits went to the camp, and showed the place to the culprits. It was discovered $hat articles which could not b«r recovered were things of no value to a beduin such as photograph paper, caps etc. raost probably were thrown away in the desert and could not be found. Therefore it was decided after consulting the American Cdmmanding Officer that they be struck off the list, provided the culprits pay the sum of Rs. 525/- representing the amount stolen during the two thefts. As far as punishment concerned the Residency Agent explained to the Royal Air Force and American Commanding Officers that the 'giiwad' is considered as a great / punishment. * v&lt;» - 3 - punishment to tribesmen and the procedure followed under this doctrine, the culprits should receive pardon after making good the loss. He suggested that in order to get the co-operation of the Shaikh of Bani Qatab in future cases, both the R.A.F. and the American Commanding Officers may express their thanks to Ali bin Abdullah and say that in appreciation of the trouble taken by him in the matter they, for his sake, have pardoned the culprits hoping that there Will be no recurrence of this nature. This was done and Ali bin Abdullah expressed his grati gratitude and added that he will do everything in his power to prevent the Bani Qatab trabesmen from committing such offences in the future. The party then returned to the Residency Agent*s I house and Ali bin Abdullah took some of the Masa'ld* rifles and mortgaged them with the Shaikh of Sharjah for Rs. 525/- which he paid to the Residency Agent and the latter paid to the R.A.F. Adjutant on the same day. This action not only protected the prestige of the British Grovernment on the Trucial Coast but also contributed to the removal of misunderstanding and the strengthening of friendly relations with the Bani Qatab and other tribes.* (ii) On the 10th, news was received that an Indian British subject named Roopchand Rerraanand of Tatta (Sind) who used to live and trade at Abu Dhabi for many years, was murdered by Khamis bin Abdullah an-Nubi a slave of Ahmad bin Khahaf bin *Utaibah. The Residency Agent proceeded to Abu Dhabi on the 13th for investigation and returned to Sharjah on the 15th. The murderer who was arrested by the Shaikh admitted having committed the crime with the object of robbing the victim. The matter has been reported in detail to the Political Agent, Bahrain whose orders are awaited regarding action against the culprit.

Commanding officer and many other officers including the Levy Commanding Officer. There was no attack and the only explana tion given by the Levy guards was that some one fired at then and they returned the fire. The Residency Agent believes that it was a made up story and that there was no ground whatsoever for the panic caused in the camp. Three nights previous to this the Residency Agent was informed on the phone that there was an explosion near the American D.F. Station and he went all round the camp as far as five miles inland and could not find any truth in the report. (ii) On the 25th and 26th February the Clerk of V/orks, R.A.F. A.M. 7 .D., Sharjah, reported to the Residency Agent that, it had been reported that R.A.F. cement stolen between the ship and the shore was being hidden in some houses in Sharjah. The Shaikh was requested to send some of his men with the clerk of Works to search the suspected houses which'he did. cement was accordingly found in the houses searched. The culprits were arrested by the Shaikh who after flogging them set them free and returned the cement to the R.A.F. 25. ,VEATHEll Highest Maximum 83 on 25.2.*45 Lowest Mj-nimum 50 on 19.2.»45 /Highest...Confidential 10, J? \\ Trucial uoast igews Heport jmoo 5 for the period ending the 15th March 1945* a During the period under report 14 westbound and 14 iCastbound aircraft passed through# 27 . ^hipping ; on the 6th '‘Barala*' arrived at ^harjah from Basrah.

We all know of course the arguments which palliate such savagery and have become hardened to all sorts of horrors during the last few years. Nevertheless, when I next see the Shaikh of Dubai, I propose to ask him whether he cannot strengthen his preventative police arrangements to such an extent as to obviate the necessity for such punishments.

R.A»F » (i) At about lQ a.m. on the 15th an R.a*F* truck crashed into a reed hut in Sharjah and killed a sick man who was lying inside and then drove on without stopping. The political officer, Trucial Coast, went to the scene of the accident after calling upon the R.A*F* authorities to take immediate steps to trace and apprehend ehe driver of the vehicle, investigations resulted in the tracing of the vehicle and the arrest of the driver who has been arrested and charged with manslaughter. It appears that the vehicle belonged to the R.A*F* Anti-Malaria Squad who, in the course of their duty, left it on the morning of the accident, outside the village in charge of an Aircraftsman who was not a qualified driver. For some unknown reason he attampted to drive the vehicle and entered the village where, from the track marks it is apparent that he lost control. He first collided with the parapet of a small well, swerved to avoid a fence, crashed through the reed hut, drove on a short distance, stopped, bausHed into another fence and then drove off. The deceased was a Persian working as a coolie in the R•A•F* camp and the question of paying compensation to his family is under consideration. (ii) Reference para 52 (i) of News Report No.8 of 1945. The case was referred to South Iraq Area HQ, P*A*I«C*, who sent Special Investigation Bureau personnel to carry/-2 / carry out further investigations. The result of these investigations is not known as the special Investigation Bureau Officers apparently left Sharjah without reporting to the Station Commander, it appears however that the original investigation was inadequate and inefficiently aarried out. The two NCOS are still under arrest and awaiting trial. The delay on the part of in convening a Court Martial is preaumably due to the incomplete evidence and The belief that other persons were involved in the shooting. There.is no reason to apprehend tfoa4 further trouble breaking ouo in the Company. (iii) Reference para 52 (ii) of News Report No.8 of 1945. The case against the Sepoy has been dropped due to lack of evidence. The political officer however has reason to believe that many of the defence witnesses committed perjury. 6q. victory in gurope Celebrations . '.The £inal Allied victory in Europe was celebrated here with surprising enthusiasm and spontaneity. As soon as Germany*s unconditional surrender was*officially announced all public buildings and private houses in Sharjah were decorated, even down to the humbledreed hut.

For three days Sharjah and Dubai were en fete and the streets were thronged with large crowds following numerous dancing parties performing the only Arab dance known in these parts - a war dance 1 Congratulatory messages were received from the Shaikh of Dubai, Sharjah and Ajman and on the 9th the Political Officer, Trucial Coast r received a deputation of Sharjah and Dubai mer chants who offered their verbal congratulations. On the 11th a crowd of about 2000 men, women and children gathered outside the Agency office where dancing continued until sunset* On the 12th the political officer, Trucial Coast, gave an official dinner party for the Shaikhs and notables. It was not possible to make the necessary arrangements and issue invitations in time to hold it on one of Die official 'VF* days.

Trouble again broke out between Abu Dhabi and the Beni QitabJ the latter taking the initiative. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi at once sent his brothers Hazza T and Zayid to Buraimi to deal with the situation. An army of about 500 men composed mostly of Nanasir tribesmen was rained and marched under the command of Zayid bin Sultan as far as Balaj al Mashrooh which is about 20 miles from Beni* qitab territory. Zayid was supported by Shaikh Ahmad bin Muhammad Tr as-SaIf of Hafit, Rashid bin Hamad al Shamsi of Eamasah twk and Saqr bin Sultan Chief of the Nai'm. Before fighting t*S^» place (Abu Dhabi sources assert that a minor attack, with no casualties on either side, was actually launched by Zayid) an i overture/-✓ * 2 overfire for peace was submitted by the Beni Oitab through Tuhammad bin Hahmah bin Salmin of al Bu Shamis, Obaid bin Juma f h of Beni Ka’ab tribe, Al Hiqaishi, Shaikh of Ibri, ?Tatar bin Salim Shaikh of Dhank and Abdullah bin Bashid Shaikh of Boot, on condition that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi returns to the Beni Qitab 14 camels out of the 30 claimed. This offer was accepted and this old dispute was finally settled and situation once again returned to normal. Ruler of Sharjah, set out to Buraimi by car in order to mediate in this dispute. r,T hen he reached a point about 25 miles south west of Dubai, one of his cars turned upside down. After a delay of 24 hours he succeeded in setting the car right and then continued his journey but when he reached f Anaij sand hills which lie about 70 miles from Dubai on the way to Buraimi, his cars could not go any further owing to the softness of the sand against which they igf-s-usaxs were not properly equipped and he had to return to Sharjah and go again by camel. He left Sharjah by camel on the 21st but as he heard on the way that the trouble came to an end, he changed his course and returned to Sharjah on the 25th. Beni Oitab arrived at Buraimi but took no active part in the matter as it had reached a final stage and his intervention was no longer necessary. He returned to Dhaid on the 21st. and Huhammad bin Ahmad as-Salf at Hafit, Sayid Tariq and s a^ r id Majid proceeded to Hamasah where they visited Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad al Shamsi. From there they proceeded to T'ahdhah of the Beni Ka’ab, Hadi Hatta and returned to Batinah via Wadi al Qaur. They were accompanied by Wudhaffar bin Sulaiman, Wall of Sohar, who conducted everything for them. They had with then about 50 followers and were later joined by a similar number of bedouixs of various tribes. The real object of their visit is still unknown but some of their Batini followers are believed to have said that they have come in order to pave the my for the Sultan’s impending/- On the 16th, shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr, brother of the Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin, Paramount chief of the (ii) Reference para.105(iii)of News Report No.15 of 1945.

Khalifah bin Zayid of Abu Dhabi was, however, greatly disappointed at Buraimi as he had expected that they will pay him a visit /vhich they had not done. It is reported that when they reached Yanqul from Wadi Ahin and tried to go to Dhank, the inhabitants of Allayah prevented them from passing through their territory and they had to divert their way to Khabib and then to Sinainah. On the whole the visit was not a success, and the Omani chiefs showed unnoticeable concern. (iii) When Japan’s unconditional surrender to the Allies was officially announced on the 16th, flags were flown on G-overnmnt and public buildings in Sharjah and Dubai. In the latter town the shops were closed for three days and 15 guns were fired. Owing to Hamadhan it was not possible to hold war dances which is to do usual/on such occasions. 114. B.A.F.

The Residency Agent, accompanied by the Shaikh, went and inspected the hmt and found that the damage done was not considerable. He immediately reported the matter to the R.A.F. requesting them to investigate and take necessary action. At the time of the crash some native employees of the Americans were on the vehicle and there is no doubt that they v/ere taking them there for an obvious purpose as the hut was quite close to the/-the brothel area (iii) Reference para 107 of News Report No.15 of 1945.

They telegraphed to Sharjah for spares which were sent to them by air (by Catalina which alighted at Firfah port which lies about 100 miles north west of Abu Dhabi). Later the same plane paid another visit to this place in order to pick up one of the Party’s G-.Is who contracted an infection in his hand and had to be removed to Sharjah for treatment, having been replaced by another man. brought from Sharjah by the same plane. The party was supnliMd accompanied by four guides provided by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi at the request of the Residency Agent. Lieut. Moore says that the roads were practically impassable by vehicles; in some places the ground was too soft for cars to negotiate while in others there were heavy sand dunes and that the heat was so intense that life was rendered quite uruSomfort- able. The party left one of their heavy trucks at Abu Dhabi asit needed some parts v/hich will be obtained from Abadan. The party’s nemt move will be towards the Batinah and Muscat.

(i) There is an islet named Zoarah lying between Ajman and Himriyah where fishermen from Ajman used to cast their nets and catch fish. It has been usual for the people of Himriyah to go and take a share out of their catch on the ground that the place where they fish at is within Himriyah territory. The Ajman fishermen recently complained to Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid that they find it difficult for them to lose a substantial part of their catch and requested him to do something to stop this practice The Shaikh told them to go and pursue their business as usual and that he will go there and deal with the people of Himriyah. Accordingly, on the 11th, they went and started fishing. Shaikh Rashid accompanied by a number of his men also went but hid themselves somewhere nearby. As soon as the people of Himriyah appeared to take their share as usual, Shaikh Rashid and his men came out for them, attacked them, arrested seven of them, brought2 [ to3 them to A,1man and Icept them in prison; the rest having fled away. It happened two days later that a native of Himriyah found a cow belonging to the people of Adrian and took it away to Homriyah. The Shaikh of Ajman, in retaliation, had the Himriyah prisoners flogged and threatened to continue this every day until the cow is restored. Soon afterwards “Rahmah bin Abdur Rahman, Shaikh of Hira, mediated in the dispute, effected the release of Himriyah prisoners and had the cow restored to Ajman. The Shaikh of Himriyah, Humaid bin Abdur Rahman, has been away at Buraimi; his son Hadif bin Humaid is acting for him. % (ii) During the period under report about 16 Suri dhows loaded with about 3000 scores of rafters arrived at Dubai and Sharjah. All these rafters were purchased by merchants of Dubai and Sharjah. (iii) As a result of the import of some 4 lacs Tumans from Persia into Dubai, the rate of Persian Riyals went down considerably On the 11th, the rate was 125 Tumas to 100 Rupees but two days later the rate went up; on the 15th it was 104 Tunas to 100 Rupees. It is said that this fall in the rate of Persian exchange is due to the fact that banks in Persia have recently stopped issuing drafts on abroad. This had affected to a certain extent the local market too. (iv) Oh the 9th, Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad al IQialifah, brother of the Ruler of Bahrain, arrived at Sharjah on board s.s.

As the steamer was leaving very soon, he could not accept the Shaikh of Dubai’s invitation to cone ashore and have lunch with him.

(iii) Reference paragraph 115(ii)of Hews Report Ho.15 of 45 The Officer Commanding, R.A.F.Sharjah, has informed the Residency Agent verbally that the men concerned had been removed to Casablanca and that in their absence no cation can be taken. The case was therefore considered closed and the Shaikh informed accordingly. (iv) On the 19th, Saqr bin Sultan, Shaikh of Sharjah’s elder son (acting in his father’s-absence) reported to the Residency Agent that about midnight on the 18th a jeep car carrying two Americans who were drunk and a native employee, came down to the town and on their way back to the Camp cameright across the simmer residential quarters of-the inhabitants (which are situated between the camp and the town) and that when the inhabitants wanted to prevent then from getting off their car, they tried to beat then with bottles of liquor which they carried in their hands. After a short squabble they left towards the Camp, m hey returned a little while laterbut when they noticed the inhabitants sitting together, they turned back to the Camp and disappeared, ^lie Shaikh T s son, however, omitted to mention the fact that during the Americans 1 second attempted visit, the Shaikh’s Secretary Ibrahim bin ruhanmad al ? T idfa T fired four shots into the air with the object of scaring them and preventing them from drawing near the natives, m he Residency Agent, accompanied by the Shaikh’s son, went to the Gamp and reported the matter to the R.A.F. authorities who promised to make the necessary investigation forthwith. The Officer Commanding, T&gt; .A.F.Sharjah, has now' replied that the matter had been investigated by him but nothing concrete was extracted by the investigation as the Americans reported that they:- (a) Were at the Coffee Shop on legitimate business. (b) Their persons were handled in the attempt by the Shaikh’s' guards to arrest the native employee. (c) They did not fire any shots as the American personnel have ni&gt;t had any arms at Sharjah for a considerable time. (d) The personnel conceded were not drunk. (e) Shots were fired at the American personnel, approximately five shots being-fired. The Officer Commanding added that as further investigation into this subject would be fruitless, he proposed not to take any further action. The Residency Agent informed the Shaikh of the result of this investigation and at the same time pointed out to him that it is quite undesirable that his men should take to the habit of firing shots whenever any such incident happens as, although the real object of so doing is to prevent harm befalling the local people, it might well happen that shots fired amongst a crowd of people cause injury or death in which case great complications will arise which would lead to serious trouble. He urged on him to warn his men to refrain from firing and to report to him immediately an incident happens. 1^8/-- 4 - n U 138. Local Affairs. (i) On the night of the 15th, Shaikh Rashid bin Said bin T-aktura, accompanied by about 15 of his relatives and followers went by launch to Khaur G-hanadhah, 45 miles west of Dubai, for fishing and returned to Dubai on the 17th. Certain unknown persons in Dubai took advantage of this visit in order to stirpp trouble, despatched letters to Shaikh Shakhbut, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, telling him that Rashid had set out to G-hanadhah with a large force with the object of attacking Abu Dhabi and that tt andan bin Randan, brother-in-law of Rashid and the son of a former Ruler of Abu Dhabi who has been living in Dubai since the murder of his father at Abu Dhabi, left Dubai for Abu Dhabi i with another force of sea-borne troops. As soon as this false news reached Shakhbut, he believed it and immediately ordered general mobilization, manned his fort and held all strategic points within and outside the town of Abu Dhabi and recalled his brothers Razza r and Zayid from Buraini. Then he waited for so-called the/attacking force of Dubai but there was none. In the meantime a jollyboat arrived at Abu Dhabi from Dubai and the passengers stated that there was no move against Abu Dhabi. In order to have this information confirmed the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi sent a man to Dubai to report to him about the matter. His nan wrote to him that there was nothing at all and that everything was quiet at Dubai. The Shaikh and the people of Dubai were, however, greatly amazed at this rash action of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. Shaikh Rashid had in fact no intention of opening hostilities T,r ith Abu Dhabi and his trip to G-hanadhah was merely a pleasure trip. ThereWds also no truth whatsoever in the report that Randan had left Dubai with a sea-borne force; Hamdan in fact never left Dubai during that period. ,,7 hen the news reached the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi that the report he had received was entirely false, he was greatly relieved and cancelled all the defensive measures which he had taken. (ii) Information has been received that Shaikh Abdullah bin Oasin al Thani, Ruler of Ratar, has gone to Odeid with a number of his followers in three launches. The local peopleinterpret this unexpected visit to a remote point as Odeid as an attempt on the part of the Shaikh of qatar to establish his sovereignty over Odeid tea which the Paler of Abu Dhabi is i said to consider it as part of his domain. (iii) Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al TOiaimah, has been away at TT anai t and r 7adi al Oaur since the past two weeks. TT e is reported to have gone there to collect zakat and to repair a dilapidated fort and also to build a new I'urabba’ah (fort)at kadi al Qaur for security purposes. (iv) On the 20th, the Residency Agent received a report that a local jollyboat loaded with some 40 bags of smuggled sugar was about to leave Sharjah creek for Persia. He at once sent for the Shaikh f s Secretary and had the jollyboat searched. Unfortunately nothing was found on the jolljrboat but the Residency Agent had reason to believe that it was intended to smuggle sugar but this pre-mature search had frustrated the efforts of the smugglers. Later in the evening the Residency Agent received a further report that another jollyboat belonging to a ^harjah native named Rashid bin Obeid was at the mouth of the creek bouh* for Persia loaded with smuggled goods. rn he Residency Agent again sent for the Shaikh’s Secretary and both had the boat searched. Rhey found 5 bales of piecegoods and 40 cases of tea. V7 hen the owner was asked to explain how he possessed these goods, he stated that he had purchased the piecegoods from TAiscat and in support of his statement he produced a manifest issued by the Unseat Customs. As regards the tea, he alleged that he had purchased it from Sur and when he was called upon to prove this he stated that he had witnesses who would testify to the correctness of his statement. He produced one Thani bin Abdullah who stated on oath that the tea in question was purchased at gur in his presence and that he knew the seller. The cargo was, therefore, released. 129. v.J.Day. On the 17th, in celebration of v.J-Day, the Residency Agent gave an official dinner party for the Shaikhs and notables of wio _ucial voasc.

Liost of the r.rticles stolen consisted of tools and medical instruments the most important of which was a microscope stolen from the g*A*F* Hospital. The Shaikh of Sharjah was asked to make thorough investigation into these thefts and recover the missing articles. The reasons for this increase of thefts during tills period are due to the fact that the A*M.W.i).

No settlement has yet been reached but it is apparent that the Shaikh of Dubai, is considerably perturbed as a result of the warning given to him by the Political Resident and has become more active in the matter. (ii) Eight members of the Tunaij tribe who usually live in Dhaid and Ras-al-Khaimah areas took possession of one of the towers at Dhaid which they claim to be theirs and which was in de facto possession of Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad. Shaikh Khalid's guard in that tower ; one Jum’ah As-Sawag,is said to have betrayed Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad and surrendered the tower to Tunaij whom he had joined against his former master. Shaikh Khalid went to Kalba soon after this incident and it-is not known what measures he proposes to take but it is belived that he had recalled his nephew Humaid bin Abdullah from Muscat in order to deal with the situation. Shaikh Khalid attributes this move by Tunaij to intrigues^by the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ras- al-Khaimah. It is also believed that the Agreement concluded between the Shaikh of Sharjah and the Beni Oitab Chiefs (referred to at para 28(iii) of News Report No.4 of 1946) has deluded the Tunaij to bring pressure to bear upon Shaikh Khalid to grant them, a similar concession. a 36.

The one shot fired grazed the arm of one BOR and' penetrated the forearm of another causing wounds not considered serious. 'T’his appears to be a case of excessive vigilance on the part of the Askari guard and possible faille of the R.A.E. to properly co-ordinate movements of guards and patrols. The Askari has been detained ^or interrogation purposes and one of the injured BORs was removed to Habbaniyah for^treatment. 38. Weather Report .

A slave woman of shaikh Muhammad bin Sfelim was wounded by a slave of Shaikh bultan bin Salim, but her condition is not serious# ■B I (v) After an absence of about 4 months from the Coast, Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin, paramount Chief of the Beni Qitab tribe, arrived at Sharjah on the 20th of October. Immediately on his arrival the Shaikh of Sharjah visited him at the place where he had put up and invited him to dinner but he apologised. Next morning he returned the call on the Shaikh of Shax*jah who later brought him to the Agency to call on the Residency Agent# Muhammad bin Ali apologised to the Residency Agent lor his failure to come to Sharjah to meet y Sheikh/-Shaikh of Abu Dhabi*s representative v/hen invited to do so saying that he coula not come ov^ing to the incessant menace of raids against his tribe which kept him busy all the time and spared him no chance to leave the desert* The Residency Agent informed him that his making peace with Abu- Dhabi was to his own advantage ana that had he agreed to do so ana followea Government*s advice he would have saved himself and his tribesmen a lot of trouble and avoided unnecessary loss of life ana property. He seated that he had really desired to make peace with Abu Dhabi but he could not see his way to ao so as long as the bhaikh of Abu Dhabi and Dubai were not on good teims. he stressed the fact that he had given the Shaikh of Dubai a pledge not to make s separate peace with Abu Dhabi and that if he acted otherwisej it would be a bad stigma on him* He also said that if he were to make peace with Abu Dhabi against the wish of the Shaikh of nubai, both the Shaikhs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi would join hands against him if and when they come to friendly terns later. In my opinion, this latter possibility is very unlikely and there is no doubt that the Chief of the beni Qitab was inculcated on by the Shaikh of Dubai to put forth such an argument in support of his attitude in declining to accept our advice to make peace with Abu Ekbai* Dhabi. In the course of talk the Residency Agent enquired trom him whether the Shaikh of Dubai had supplied him with any arms ana ammunition* He said that the Shaikh of Dubai supplied him with rounds of ammunition but most of them turned to be dead. huhammad bin All bin Huwaidin visited Dubai on the &lt;^lst where he met Shaikh Rashid bin Said ana returned to Sharjah on the 22nd. He is at present camping at a water well called Biyat in Dm al ^aiwain territory. 151* leather Report * Highest Maximum 98 OF 17.10.46 Lowest Minimum 68 OF 17.10.46 Highest Humidity 86 * lfc.10.46 Average ' 62 % § 1200 G.li.T n it 69 % £ O o • r • HJ Rainfalls NilCo nf ideiitial; 21k' &amp; Truci£l Co&amp;sf heve Report Lo.21 for the period 24th of October to the 2th of November 1946*- Confidential BAHR U T RECEIPT. 1 52 • £*Q*A*C * During the period under report 10 westbound ana 8 Eastbouna aircraft paasea through. 155* bhippiiua (i) On the 24th of October 55* ITRUi arrived at bharjah from Inaia. £he aischarged 613 packages, sailec the same day for Dubai, theie she dischargee 6246 packages ana left for Bahrein on the 27th.

The Dubai party killed the hsjiri bedouin and made prisoher of the other but was subsequently released, the camels looted by the raiders are stated to be 27. .ing of 12 Ahbab ana Lazari* tribesmen lec by Paris bin ana Khalifa bin Lajid, a relative of the Shaikh of Dubai, attacked an Abu Dhabi caravan leaving Abu Dhabi for buraimi at a place called Saih al qata within abu Dhabi territory. The caravan comprised of 4 men and one woman. One Mansuri namec Lubarak bin Oma^r was killed but the remaining 3 men and one woman were set ffee. It is reported that the raiders took kv.ay one camel a.nd some petty articles. / (iii) At 1215 hcui'S on November the 1st, baif bin ^Abdullah, cousin of the Shaikh of himriyah, ana one Sabbat, a ^u&amp;ro of Shaikh Laj id* bin Saqr, hi other of the shaikh ol Sharjah, v ere fireo on ana killed, in a brcti^el house in Sharjah. A woman living in a nearby house also received two bullet wounas, one of which was fatal. She was flown to Bahrain the following day for medical treatment. The murderers who were three in number were Shaikh JHadif bin Humaic, son of the present Shaikh oi himriyah, Shaikh; Sultan bin Abdur Rahman, brother ol the Shaikh and one of their slaves. This act on their part was a reprisal for the murder of Shaikh Abaur Rahman bin Saif, the late Shaikh of bimriayh, who was killed by sail' bin Abdullah fourteen years ago. of Sharjah sent a number of his men by car in pursuit of the murderers who had fled on camels, but the pursuit party returned after reaching as far as U4 el Jarf, seven miles from Rimriyeh without overtaking the murderers. It is obvious that the Shaikh of Sharjah purposely avoided to take immediate steps to secure the arrest of the murderers as it is believed that he bore a grudge against the victim, Sait bin Abdullah, whom he had suspected of harbouring evil intentions towards him. Re was happy enough that he settle the dispute between the shaikh oi has al Khaimah ana Lis brother, but his efforts were again fruitless, as both sides were still adamant. The cnly r improvement in the situation, as stated by the shaikh of Sharjah, is that neither side was really anxdous to fight, it is, however, rumoured that the Shaikh of has al Khaimah interviewed shaikh Rumaic bin Muhammad, the eldest eon of Shaikh Luhammad bin Salim, ana told him that he will agree to his ana his father's return to uLe town tut that She.ikh Luhammaio bin Salim refused to accept this offer. / On the 4 th oi Lev ember another Dubai party Soon after this incident hao taken place the shaikh got pia ofhim so easily ana is apparently taking no further a cjA.
