PAIFORCE. 31st January, 1945. J. I am sorry not to have been able to see you again before my departure from Bahrein, first of all to thank you ior a most pleasant dinner and second to have a few words about our activities in the Bahrein area. As you know we are at present busy on the airfield improvements at Mahurruq and the work is increasing in volume daily. This is quite' apart from the projected new airfield site on the main 'island, a matter which has not yet been decided. As regards Uahurruq, we shall require a native labour force of approximately 1750 to be continuously available to the Resident Engineer for the next nine months to assist in the construction of the pierced steel planking runways and taxi tracks, and also for the necessary additional building work, roads, etc. involved. We understand that the Army will also require a native labour force of approximately 500 in the very near future to augment their Army personnel when they start work on their Army transit area at Mahurruq. I need not stress the extreme importance of the extensions to the present airfield at Mahurruq and I know you are fully alive to our needs there. We learn that the B.A.P.C. 0, are shortly paying off a large amount of their labour, but at the same time there is quite a chance that they may proceed with further work which may affect our requirements. I would welcome your views as to the amount of labour you consider will be available for us taking into account any works B.A.P.0.0. are likely to continue with and the usual drift of labour to the pearling industry. You may remember our difficulties in maintaining a labour force last year of 900. I would be most grateful for an early reply because if the numbers we require are in doubt then we must search in other directions for the additional labour v/e require. I hope to pay you another visit shortly and as promised I will give you good warning so that you will have time to make arrangements for me to meet the ruling Sheikh. Major J. Hickinbotham, Political Agency, BAHREIN.PRIVATE &amp; PERSONAL Political Agency, Bahrain, 5th February 1945. vA My dear Air Vice Marshal, Please refer to your letter No,AHQ/RAG/2 dated ja nuar y 21st which was received by me on February 4th. 2. I have discussed your labour requirements with His Highness and with Belgrave and do not anticipate that you will have any particular difficulty in maintaining a force of approximately two thousand two hundred and fifty men,inclusive of the army requirements^being some eight hundred and fifty more than you are now employing. The Bahrain Petroleum Company will be discharging labour from now onwards and I do not anti cipate that this pearling season will absorb even as many as it did last year. 3. I hope that it will be possible for you to let me have some idea in the near future where you intend to construct the Army Transit Camp. I am anxious to keep Sir Geoffrey Prior and the Bahrain Government fully informed of developments and as far as possible of future plans. In particular if it is desired to acquire land or rights of way etcetera then it is essential that I be given the oarlieot information so that preliminary negotiations can be started without delay for it is often very dirficult to obtain advantageous terms in a hurry especially is this so now that the war is receding from this part of the world. People are inclined to become commercially minded. 4. I shall be free at any time and place to discuss any question. It is only a matter of letting me have as much notice as possible even though that be only five minutes. I will arrange for the exchange of calls next time you come down. Air Vice Marshal R. George, C.B.E., M.C., Air Headquarters, •Iraq &amp; Persia, R.A.F. PAIFOHCE. Yours sincerely. A C/c Pri. n*&gt; illy11^ No- ryy-//—y/of ises Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 8th R/Awal, 1365 February 11, 1946. 1 &lt;9 H. B. M 1 s Political Agent, Bahrai n. Memorandum;- Bahrain Receipt 7^- During the course of the work which has been carried out by a Palestinian contractor, working for the R.A.F. or Air Ministry, on the Muharraq aerodrome, whose boundary, incidentially, a pp ears now to have extended considerably beyond the limits of'the original area, the main public road connecting Muharraq with Kedd and other Muharraq villages, skirting the bay of Arad, has been rendered almost impassable for motor vehicles and at several places in what used to be the road, some distance outside the aerodrome permanent pumping stations have been erected. If permission had been sought by the authorities concerned to erect these stations on Government land permission would certainly have been given but I can trace no record of any application for permission to build on this ground. I therefore wish to protest strongly at the action which has been taken. His Highness Shaikh Sulman throughout the war has givjn permission to the Navy, the Army and the R .A.F. to maKe free use of any land which they have required for camps, wireless stations or other war purposes, in his territories, provided that they applied for it through the proper channels. He has also presented, as a gift, a valuable piece of land, connecting what used to be the two aerodromes at Muharraq, to the Air Ministry. His Highness on visiting Muharraq recently found the main road destroyed and buildings, about which he had no knowledge, erected where the road used to run. I should bo grateful if you would acquaint the R.A.F. authorities with these facts and request them to restore the road as soon as possible. In September 1945 the Muharraq Municipality protested to the Bahrain Government about the state to which the road had been reduced, tne matter was taken up by the Acting Adviser to whom the Air Liaison Officer wrote a letter, No.ALO- 01/2/W dated 22nd September 1945, stating that the liability for repair rested with the Air Ministry, not the contractors, and implying that the road would be repaired when the heavy vehicles used by the contractors ceased to operate and when labour became available. It to 2/ S $ ■ ,4 Coniidential. Bahrain receipt. No...© - 2 - would appear that they have now ceased to operate heavy vehicles, but no work has been done on the road. Regarding the sites of the pumping stations, application should be made to the Bahrain Government for the acquisition of these areas, in the usual way/ as presumably, being permanent works, they will have to become part of the aerodrome property. Adviser to the Government, 3.Z.No. C/204. (P political Agency, Bahrain, The 23rd of February, 1946. To The Air Staff Liaison Officer, Bahrain. Memorandum. I have received a letter from the Adviser to the i3ahrain Government in which he states: (1) During the work carried out recently on Muharraq for the R.A.F. or Air Ministry constructions appear to have considerably exceeded the boundary of the land belong ing to the R.A.F. or the Air Ministry. I shall be grateful if you will let me know what buildings have been erected outside the R.A.F. limits. (2) The road at Arad Bay has been flooded and it is now impassable for vehicular traffic. I shall be glad to know what steps have been taken to restore the road. (3) A Pumping Station has been erected on the sea shore on the north coast of the Arad Bay. This is situated some miles from the R.A.F. property, and I should like to have your early proposals for the acquisition or leasing of the land. 2. The Adviser informs me that there was some corres pondence between the Air Liaison Officer - No.AL0-1701/2/W dated the 22nd September, 1945 - in'connection with the destruction of a road on Muharraq. I must^ remind you that correspondence with the Bahrain Government on important matters should pass through this office. I should be grateful if you would let me have copies of the corres pondence.

PERSIAN GULF. 27th Febroary, 1946. Sir, an . Reference your memorandum C/204 dated 23rd February, 1%jS, 2* The boundaries of the R.A.F. property at Muharraq are very badly efined at the present, and it is hoped that the survey party which is now employed at Hamala will survey Muharraq during March. It will then be possible to produce accurate maps of the area and to assess the extent of encroachment#. 3* The reference to the flooding of the road at Arad Bay is not understood. I have inspected this road at regular intervals during the past month and on every occasion the road has been open* It is believed that at the end of last year the tide overflowed the sea wall and caused some flooding, but this is an unusual occurrence. 4^ There are two pumping stations on the north coast of the Arad Bay. The one is about 140 yards from the R.A.F. boundary and the second is about 70 yards. In the past the sea wall was always considered to be the: southern boundary of the R.A.F. property. As this is not the case it will be necessary to submit the matter to Air Headquarters, •Iraq &amp; Persia for authority to acquire or lease the land in question. 5- Attached herewith are four copies of letters in connection with the road from Muharraq to the villages. I recently gave my personal assurance to the State Adviserthat these roads would be made up and for the past six weeks there has been a gang of labourers engaged in filling in the pot - holes and repairing the surface. This matter was first brought to the attention of the ASLO by the Acting State Adviser in memorandum No 1720-11 dated September 13th, (P. R» M« WILLXAHS.)

M's Political Agent, Bahrain, Memorandum:- His Highness Shaikh Sulman has received a public petition from the inhabitants of Galali, Samaheej and Dair, three villages on the north coast of Muharraq Island ^complaining that they are now to a great extent cut off from Muharraq owing to the fencing in of the Muharraq aerodrome. His Highness has asked me to refer the matter to you, 2. The aerodrome and R.A.F, camps are the property of the Air Ministry who acquired the land partly by purchase and partly by gift from His Highness, They are entirely within their rights in closing this area but it does i &lt; b (^ seriously affect the people living in the villages on the far side of the aerodrome who are mostly fishermen accustomed to carry their fish into Muharraq every day. They now have to make a circuit of several miles to reach Muharraq and they also complain that as busses and taxi's are forbidden to pass on the road through the camp they have to pay more for travelling by motor vehicles. They also assert, though I have reason to believe that this is not altogether correct, that they are not allowed to walk along the road that passes through the camp. 3, I understand that there is some possibility of the R.A,F. allowing access through or at the side of the R,A.F. camp, if this could be done the situation would be improved, ) S,Z Adviser to the Government, I.
