However, Manners recommends against vessels travelling along the coast further south, which he describes as being extremely unsafe. Manners also states that the Wahhabi chief is preparing to make war upon al Bidda, however his postscript suggests that the Wahhabi chief has returned to the interior, with amicable arrangements having been effected.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673698.0x00001e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
