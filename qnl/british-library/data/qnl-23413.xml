B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. MSI^ORANDUM . The Bahrain Government is considering the advisability of holding a census of the entire population. Such a thing has never been done before in Bahrain. It would be of great help if any information on the holding of a census could be obtained from India so that if possible the methods employed in India could be used in Bahrain. I should be grateful if you could obtain for me any Government rules or regulations governing the holding of a census. Adviser to the Government. I SMNo. [9^ -6/70 Political Agency, Bahrein| the 20th November 1938 To The Honourable the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Memorandum 1 The Bahrain Government are anxious, if possible, to hold a census of the population of the Bahrain Islands. In my opinion this is a venture to be encouraged, for it will provide valuable information on a number of matters which are rather too obscure at the moment, and it would be welcomed by the Bahama leaders certainly and probably by the Arabs also. 2. The Adviser has asked for information on the holding of a census in India, so that similar methods can be employed here. In the circumstances of Bahrain it would probably be sufficient if the census was conducted in the manner adopted in tribal areas in India, and T request, therefore, t at, if you see no objection, the Government of India may be asked to send me copies of the instructions issued for the tribal census in 1931 and of the forms used.

Sir Trenchard has had some experience of census work himself, he wrote the Baluchistan one for 1921, and he realises therefore the amount of work involved. He suggests that it might be worth while for the Bahrain Government to get an Indian subordinate official who has participated in a census to take (a/^^ i).* detail off Belgrave’s shoulders, leaving Belgrave himself free to deal with the wider aspects of the report. 4 X 4.

The population according to the Census of 1940 was 89,970. I think this figure was slightly lower than it should have been owing to the then fear, which was entirely unwarranted, of conscription. We can assume, as in the case of India, an annual increase of 2^# especially as living conditions are very much better than they used to be. In addition, during recent years there has been a big influx of Persians, Omanis and Qatar Arabs, in one year over 600 Qatar Arabs came here and settled in Bahrain. 2. The number of people, excluding Europeans at Awali, who now number about 1,000, drawing rations is 105,000. My opinion is that the population can now be assessed at 105,000. Any excess of persons on the ration list can be balanced against the people who are nonliving here, who do not draw rations, this category would include Bapco European employees and quite a number of poor Persians and vagrants who /i seem to subsist without rations, though they manage A to do so in something of a mystery. ^ ^ A- ^ O r * ?

Dear Sir, We have been advised the United Kingdom Delegation to the United Nations that you would be kind enough to handle for the Statistical Office the distribut ion of the enclosed quenstionnaires which relate to demographic statistics in Bhutan, Bahrein Islands, Kuwait, Muscat and Oman, Qatar, and the Trucial Coast. The Population Commission of the United Nations has urged that the demographic statistics year book attempt to present statistics, especially population totals, for all areas of the world. The Statistical Office is fully aware of the complete lack of most of these data among nomadic peoples and in under-developed areas of the world generally. But nevertheless, we feel that it is preferable to have on file, in uniform table form, all such official data as ara- available, and we have, therefore, not prepared an abridged questionnaire which would summarize our ideas on what statistics might be available, nor have we limited the distribution of the questionnaire on the basis of presumed availability of data. I would appreciate it very much if you would be good enough to forward the questionnaires, together with the transmittal letters enclosed, tothe authorities who might be in a position to supply any estimates, at least those of total population.

Once the files of the Statistical Office have been established on the basis of this new information, auditions for future years can be made by the use of official publications or limited questionnaires it should be pointed out tnat both the statistical Commission and the Population Commission have stressed the in^portance of publish, ing figures in the yearbook which are internationally comparable. Obviously there exist many differences between countries in definitioi classification, and con^letene^o ox coverage. Eor this reason the questionnaire asks for detailed information regarding definition and classification. it would be very nelpful if yam could give us as complete information as possible on tnese questions so that international differences can be explained and evaluated.. it is possible that the ques tionnaire calls for data or class ifications that are not avaiuaule for your country. in such cases we would appreciate receiving estimates for the categories specified or data in available classifications. if neither data nor approp riate estimates are available merely indicate this by crossing out the table form. , / Demographic data are basis figures of value and interest to mai y international agencies. The Statistical 01fice has toe reoponoio— i li ty of supplying such statistics to agencies Affiliated with Hie United Nations. if we are able to build up our files completely and quickly it will be possible for us to eliminate the need for other agencies to send additional and duplicating requests to the national statistical offices. For this reason we hope that you will return the convicted questionnaire as early as possible. In view of the urgency of this inquiry, please advise us by air mail as to the approximate date when you expect you can return the completed questionnaire.

Yours ever, Agency. The Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. rCOPY E .36 (262/5/50) BRITISH RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. 1st May 1950. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a report by the Bahrain Government on the census which they have recently held. The last census was held in 1941 when the figure for the total population was 89,970. The new figure is 109,650 showing an increase of nearly 20 , 000 , but it is probable that a number of people escaped the enumeration in 1941 as it was then feared that the census was intended as a basis for either conscrip tion or taxation. It is reckoned that about 6,000 persons, nearly all of them males normally resident in Bahrain were absent when the census was taken. The increase is almost entirely confined to the towns of Manama and Muharraq and must be accounted for in part by immigration. It will be seen from the report that the Bahrain Government are of opinion that there has been no drift from the villages to the tov/ns and that the high rate of infant mortality is responsible for the absence of any increase in the population of the villages. This may be the case but I rather suspect that a certain num ber of men from the villages have obtained employment in the towns and are now residing there. 2. The total European population including Americans but excluding ships 1 crews is now 1,683. Europeans were not sepa rately enumerated in 1941, but there must have been a substan tial increase. Persian subjects number 6,934 as against 7,547 in 1941 but it is probable that many have passed themselves off as Bahrain subjects. There are many persons of Persian origin who have in fact adopted Bahrain nationality and at a rough estimate I should place the total number of persons of Persian origin and still using the Persian tongue in Bahrain at 10,000. The number of Indians including Pakistanis, Anglo- Indians and Goanese has increased from 1 .424 to 3,043. This is a very substantial increase and affords some Justification for the restrictions which the Bahrain Government have asked us to impose on the immigration of Indians. 3. You will see from the statistics that 96/t of the popula tion are Muhammadans and that there are 2,932 Christians, 975 Hindus and 293 Jews. A large proportion of the Jews now propose to emigrate to Israel and the Bahrain Government are putting no obstacle in their way, but will not permit them to return. Amongst the Muhammadans the Sunnis and Shiahs were not separately enumerated. This was in order to avoid causing ill feeling between the two sects and because the Sunnis, to which sect the ruling family belongs, feared that the figures would show a Shiah majority as they did in 1941. when 46,354 Shiahs were enumerated as against 41,944 Sunnis. 4. There are about 7,500 more males than females and taking absentees into account the excess of males over females must be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 13,000. This dispropor tion between the sexes can be accounted for in great part by the large number of foreigners who have come to Bahrain for employment without bringing their families. There are no l2 7 ' i ' occupational statistics but it is interesting to note that about 10 ^ of the indigenous population have been recorded as literate. There is no definition of what is meant by ’literacy* but it must be assumed that the vast majority of those recorded as literate have not been educated beyond the primary standard. 5.
