Vol. I of the Military Report of South-West Persia, as now printed, is intended as a supplement to the “Report on South- West Persia (Bakhtiari country)” by Major Sawyer, issued by the Intelligence Branch in 1891. It deals with an area almost untouched by either of these publications, overlapping with which has been avoided as far as possible. Its preparation was facilitated by the decision of the Home Government, in November 1907, to despatch a force of 2 officers, 8 sowars and 12 sepoys from India to Ahwaz for the protection of the interests of the Concession Syndicate, Limited, a British Company, whose experimental borings for oil were being conducted at Mamatain and Maidan Minaftun about 70 miles East and North of Ahwaz respectively. Their employes had been molested and their work interfered with by the unruly subjects of the Bakhtiari Khans, with the tacit consent of the latter, and it was considered desirable to show them that the Company had the active support of the Government of India. Work, however, having been stopped at Mama tain before the guard arrived, the latter were stationed at Maidan Minaftun, instead of being divided between this place and Mamatain, as had been originally intended. One officer (Lieutenant Wilson, 32nd Sikh Pioneers), was thus free to travel over the area and to compile a map, with geographical and other notes. This guard was withdrawn in the autumn of 1909, the necessity for its presence having ceased to exist. The present report consists of an elaboration of these notes* together with an account of the tribal, and political aspect of the district, written by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for ’Arabistan at Ahwaz, Captain D, L. R. Lorimer, LA., and a note on medical matters by Dr. Young of the Anglo-Persian Oil Coy., Limited.a The report consists of five parts. Part I, General, consists of a brief description of the district in its various aspects, political, tribal, geographical, etc. This part, which does not pretend to be exhaustive, is intended to be an introduction to Part II. Part II, Military Considerations, includes a detailed examina tion of the district from a military point of view, supplies, climate, transport, etc., being successively dealt with. It should be read in conjunction with Major Sawyer’s admirable report, which although written in 1890 is still in all essentials a true pre sentation of the country and its inhabitants. Every endeavour has been made to obtain reliable facts bearing upon these questions, but the whole condition and organization of the people militates against the existence of any source of detailed or accurate informa tion. Part III consists of route reports compiled from January to May 1908. These reports cover the whole area with a network of known tracks, and, in conjunction with the map, give informa tion regarding every part of the district. It may be said that every road of the slightest local or military importance has been traversed and reported on. Part IV, consists of geographical information which could ' not be conveniently placed in the body of the report, and has therefore been placed, in Gazetteer form, in alphabetical order. Part V, consists of appendices. The index includes all places mentioned in the text or in the map, in addition to references to all headings of importance. This report supersedes such portions of “Routes in Persia,” “ Gazetteer of Persia, ” Vol. Ill, and “Military Report on South- West Persia, 1884” as refer to the area dealt with herein. All officers to whom this book is issued are particularly request ed to bring immediately to the notice of this office any errors they may notice, and also to forward from time to time any additional authenticated information which may reach them.

The Bakhtiari Garmsir, or cold weather abode, includes, south of the Karun river, an area of about 2,000 Boundaries. square miles. It is bounded, in general terms, on the north and west by the Karim river, on the east by the Mangasht mountains, and the Kuhgalu border, and on the south by an ill-defined line drawn from a point a few miles south of Ramuz to near Shushtar. The district is hilly, with narrow fertile valleys on the east side, where the rivers receive the drainage Country. 0 f w i n ter snow on the Mangasht Moun tains. Elsewhere the country is divided by a series of low parallel ridges running uniformly from north-east to south- west, increasing in height as the traveller goes north, the intervening valleys being undulating, more or less barren, and treeless. The inhabitants are almost all Bakhtiari Lurs: the sedentary population belonging to the Chehar Lang section, the nomadic population to the Haft Lang. The number of the latter in the dis trict during the cold weather is probably at least eight times as great as that of the sedentary population. Viewed from every standpoint, the Garmsir is a tract where the characteristics of the hills mingle with those of the plains, giving rise to climatic and other conditions similar to those of other parts oi Persia The foot-hills of the so-called Zagros Range, whose south ern rampart extends from Shushtar in a south-easterly direction to Ramuz and Behbehan, occupy the whole Garmsir, and the steep range which bounds the ’Arabistan plain to the north once crossed, the whole area thence to the Karun is occupied by low ridges gradually increasing in height as the traveller proceeds northwaras. 67 I. B. ( 1 ) A2 The most prominent feature of the orography of the region is the Hillg existence of large areas of gypsum {gach) which, worn away by detrition and atmos pheric erosion, have become a systemless mass of low hills. They are treeless but grassy, and almost uninhabited, as the water which drains from them is generally talkh or bitter, being impregnated with mineral salts. This quality is characteristic of nearly all rivers draining the water of the district into the Karun, but is not percept ible in the case of the tributaries of the Ramuz river (Rud-i-Zard). The west end of the Mangasht Mountains, in the east corner of this region, is snow-capped until May, and forms th.zyailaq or summer quarters of someBabmai and a few Chehar Lang families. The Kuh-i- Asmari deserves mention if only on account of its dominating position, rising as it does to a height of over 5,000 feet from amongst gach hills not more than 2,500 feet in elevation. It is, moreover, com posed of nummulitic limestone, in striking contrast to the gach or red shales of the immediately surrounding country. Nine-tenths of the area of the garmsir is drained into the Karun Riverg river, which in its upper reaches from Pul-i- Shalu to Gotwand is entirely confined in narrow valleys between high hills, whose lofty cliffs and steep slopes run to the water’s edge, and prevent even a foot-path from following the course of the river for more than a few miles. This absence of lateral communication along the river would largely neutralize the value of bridges for military operations, unless at least six were con structed. The Karun receives only two tributaries of importance from the district: one, the Ab-i-Batwand, or Shur-i-Zan-i-Murda, draining an area extending from Darreh-i-Murdafil to a point east of Sar Tiyuk: the other, the Ab-i-Halagun, drains the districts of Marghab, NutargI, and Halagun. The Ab-i-A^la, known in its lower courses as the Rudkhaneh- i-Ra muz, rises in the Mangasht Mountains, in Kuhgalu territory, and is joined, some 15 miles north of Ramuz, by the Rud-i-Zard, an important stream formed by the confluence in the Bagh-Malik valley of the Ab-i-A £ ala Khurshid, Ab-i-Gilal, Ab-i-Bulawas, and Ab-i-Mun- ganun. The 2nd and 3rd named streams take their rise in the Man gasht, and water a large area of terraced fields. Some 12 miles north of Ramuz, the Putang or Tazang River adds its oil stained waters* to the Ab-i-A‘ala. * Mamatain, the site of experimental borings for oil in 1907, by the Concessions Syndicate Limited, is situated on the north bank of this river, a mile from it? function with the main stream.3 The Shatt-i-Malamir, which occupies the middle of the plain Lakes. name, is a shallow, marshy sheet of salt water, occupying an area of some 12 square miles in the winter and teeming with waterfowl. Its area varies greatly with the seasons, though it never dries up entirely. It has no exit, but receives water from the marches in the east corner of the plain in wet weather. Another tiny lake, or rather pond, some 30 or 40 yards square, lies on top of the gach hills north of Batwand, though the hollow and rotten formation of gypsum in this locality would seem to pre clude the existence of a lake in such a position. Two caravan routes of importance traverse the district: the first Roads. from Ahwazto Isfahan, was constructed in 1898—1902 by Messrs. Lynch Bros., on behalf of the Bakhtiari Khans, who, in return, undertook to repay by instalments the cost so incurred (about £5,000). Two suspension bridges were erected in the upper Bakhtiari country beyond MalamTr. This road, which is extensively used, is free from marauders, though cases of robbery occur every year, attributable to outside tribes, such as the Kuhgalu, rather than to the inhabitants of the district. The second route, from Shushtar to Isfahan vid Gurglr, joins the former at Malamir, vid the Murdafil pass. The district is in tersected in every direction by tracks suitable for mules and donkeys, and^ sometimes for camels: in fact it may be said that every village is connected with every other village in its neighbour hood by a fairly direct and passable track. The only passes in the district worthy of the name are those Passe?. over . K uh-i-Murdafil (height 3,500'), and Kuh-i-Sarileh (height 2,700'), which give access from Gurglr to Halagun, and from TambI to Marghab re spectively. These passes are steep and stony but not difficult. Tang-i-Nashalil, between Kaleh Tul and MalamTr, has a bad reputation for highway robbery, and is often avoided by taking a more westerly route from Bagh-Malik or Kaleh Tul vid Halagun to Malamir. The Tang-i-Dulau, north of Gudar-i-Landar, is important aa one of the few gates through the precipitous north bank of the Karun whereby communications may be obtained between the highlands and lowlands (see route No. 27). No account of the Bakhtiavi Ga' msir would Ve complete with- Commuuications from the out some reference to the ’ Arabistan p&gt;ain, •ea coast. which stretches southwards to the Persian4 Gulf from Shushtar, Ramuz, and Behbelian, broken only by the low hiHs which run from Ahwaz east-south-east below Ramuz. On the west, the Karan, split up at Shush tar into its two dis tributaries, the Ab-i-Shatait and Ab-i-Gargar, which combine again at Band-i-Qlr with each other, and with waters of the Ab-i-Diz, winds to Muhammareh, receiving no more tributaries byi Touts. Its course is broken by rapids at Ahwaz. The Ab-i-Gargar is likewise render ed impassable for vessels 5 miles south of Shushtar at Mahlbazan by a rocky ridge across the stream. The Kurdistan river, which rises in the hills north and east of Behbehan, flows thence north-west towards Ramuz, where it receives the waters of the Rud-i-Zard, and turning southwards, through the low hills bounding the Ramuz plain to the south, winds Fa 11a hi eh, where it loses itself in the canals and mud flats which extend along the whole maritime border of 'Arabistan. Both these rivers are, in varying degrees, navigable. Two steam- ers ply between Muhammareh and Nasirl, though they are occasion- ari£ prevented by shoals from reaching the wharf, and are obliged to anchor a few hundred yards down stream. From above the rapids at Ahwaz,* another steamboat, the bhushan, the property of the Persian Government, but worked by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Messrs. Lynch Bros Agents) plies to Shalili, 7 miles south of Shushtar on the Ab-i-Gargar, further progress being prevented by the rocks which dam the river at Mahibazan. A Persian-owned boat, the M’awin also runs. (See App. III.) Small native craft ascend the Jarrahi to Khalfabad, within 30 miles of Ramuz. Muhammareh,. the principal seaport of ’Arabistan, lies on the Seaports. west bank of the Karan, at its junction with , the Shatt-al-’Arab. Steamships up to 22 feet draft call regularly en route to Basrah, taking cargo to and from India *nd Europe. A weekly mail service by the British India Steam Navigation Company places Muhammareh within 5 days of Karachi and 7 days of Bombay.

It consists of a series of roughly parallel ridges, running north-west and south-east, gradually inc reas ing in height as the Zagros Mountains are approached. Metamor- phic rocks find no place in this region ; tertiary deposits, creta ceous, nummulitic, and post-nummulitie in descending order from north to south occupy the whole region. The predominating strata are gypsiferous, and are recognisable from a great distance by the grey colour and irregular contour of the systemless mass of gypsum hills, which extend from near Shushtar to beyond Ramuz in long belts, capped in places by shales and marls of a reddish tint. This gypsum {qach) is slightly soluble, and its composition often renders the water which collects from off it so strongly impregnated with mineral salts as to be undrinkable. It affords, however, good grazing, and often supports fair crops of cereals. The gypsum is in places interstratified with red marl, but appears everywhere to have undergone great contortion, and the beds lie at every angle, vertical beds being quite common over large areas. Above the gypsum, as has already been said, lie thick interval beds of sandstones, marls and shales of varying hardness. These beds are in many places capped by a layer of extremely hard conglomerate of great thickness, and as far as has been seen, every hill over 3,500 feet high, in the district is capped either with this conglomerate, or with limestone. The conglomerate appears to resist denudation well; hills capped with it usually present on one side a long, even slope up to the crest, and on the other, a vertical cliff from 500 to 1,000 feet high, denuded only by the wearing away of the softer strata below the conglomerate, which comes away in great boulders. The Tang-i-Dulau is a remarkable instance of this, and many other examples may be seen in the gorges of the Karun. Below the gypsum lies nummulitic limestone : its outcrop is of frequent occurrence in the gypsum hills, and the Kuh-i-Asmari, the most prominent hill in the whole district, appears to consist solely of nummulitic limestone. Though eaten into by gorges, and furrowed from north to s&lt;--uth by deep gorges., the limestone has nevertheless resisted denudation sufficiently to retain its broad slopes, the slopes on either side of the hill being, in the main, intact from top to bottom. Where transected by the Tang-i- Zindan to a depth of 600 or 800 feet, no cretaceous rocks appear: these must be looked for near Malamir and Hfitaigi, where several outcrops of cretaceous rock are visible.0' The oil-bearing strata, for which the district has long been known, attracted the attention of a British Syndicate, which, in 1907, commenced experimental borings at Mamatain and later at Mai dan Minafthn, where the “ shows” of oil are best situated for working. Oil was struck at the latter place in large quantities on May 26th, 1908. With the exception of the Malamlr plain, which in May 1908 with its broad alluvial expanse, and central lake, resembles closely the plains of the Persian plateau, the district includes none of the broad plains, composed of gravels and sand, which are the predom inating feature of m st Persian landscapes. The plain of Kaleh Tul and Bagh Malik are, it is true, alluvial, and probably were once lakes; but the alluvial formation is not of great depth, and in size they cannot compare with the great plains of Central Persia. The paucity of vegetation and the absence of cultivation over large areas facilitate conjecture by the traveller as to the formations that he sees: each formation has its own typical contour and shape, which can be observed unimpeded by trees or standing crops. The gorge of the Karun, which winds tortuously between steep hills and cliffs rising 1,009 or 1,500 feet sheer from the water’s edge, would itself form an interesting geological study, flanges are transected usually at right angles, and magnificent sections of rock are thus displayed : the gorges are usually very narrow, and the current varies from 4 to 8 miles an hour : no river terraces are to be seen; being mainly snow fed, the water is fresh, though augmented by countless tainted streams. It is subject to great variations of level, and in March 1908 two or three days’ con tinuous rain, coinciding with the melting of the snows, caused a rise of from 50 to 60 feet above normal autumn level at Bard-i- Qamchi. This, however, seems to be quite unusual, but it may explain the numerous ancient broken bridges that occur at intervals along the river. (iii) Zoological. The standard work on the Zoology of Persia is W. T. Bland- ford’s contribution to Goldsmid’s “Eastern Persia,” Volume II, 1876 ; though much has been discovered and written on the subject since this work was published, it remains, as far as is known, the only work dealing exclusively with Persian Zoology. Neither his explora tions, however, nor those of his predecessors, did more than touch the fringe of South-Western Persia, and much still remains to be done. Broadly speaking, the Bakhtiari Garmsir seems to lie, zoolog ically, as geologically, in the Zagros Mountain zone, rather than7 in that of Persian Mesopotamia as indicated by Blandford’s zoological map. As soon as the alluvial plain of ’Arabistan is quitted, and the low hills near Shushtar, Jaru or Ramuz entered, the species typical of the plain cease to occur, and are replaced by typical mountain species. Ursus syriacus (the grey bear of Persia) is occasionally found in the low hills of the district, and a female with two cubs was shot in April 1909, near Gurgir, the cubs being then three weeks old. A fine specimen of leopard (felis pardus) was shot near Mama- tain in 1907. A fine male ibex (capra segragus) with four does was seen on the gypsum hills south of the Karun in April 1908 by the writer, at a height of 2,500 feet. All these are typical mountain species, and their existence in the district tends to show that it belongs zoologically to the Zagros region. Other animals of special interest occurring in the district are the porcupine, the chinkara (gazella bennetti, near the Arabistan plain only), the urial (oris cycleceros), and the wild hog (in the plains only). The latter is shot “ for sport,” but Iliats extract some sort of drug from its intestines, which they use as medicine. Mr. Woosnam of the British Museum obtained a lynx at Shush in 1905 and a badger at Ramuz, and a fine fox, probably vulpes Persicus, is frequently shot in the district. The lion, until recently was known to exist in the swamps of the river Diz, but it is doubtful if any now remain. It has not been met with, as far as is known, in this district, since Layard’s time, when it was found at Ramuz and Kaleh Tub Domestic ruminants are represented by the buffalo, which is fairly common, though almost entirely in the hands of an Iliat tribe known as bArab Gao MishT, who seem to have immi grated not long ago from 'Arabistan, and to have attached them selves to the Bakhtiari in the same way as they have allied them selves to tribes in Pars. The fat-tailed sheep, small oxen, with out a hump, and the (one humped) camel complete the list; the latter animal will not be seen off the main caravan roads, however. ^ The Persian horse is to be found in every Bakhtiari camp ; spiritless and unsuited for fast work, it is nevertheless capable of covering great distances at a fast walk; it is as sure footed as a mule, and can exist on very little food. The mule is also common, and greatly valued, whilst the donkey is to be seen everywhere, and in consider able numbers.a (iv) Tribal. There is every reason to believe that the more central portion of the mountainous tract lying between Shushtar and Isfahan has been occupied from an indefinitely remote period by the tribes known as the Bakhtiari, and their direct ancestors. It is equally impossible to assign a date to the origin of the two main branches into which the tribe is divided, known as the Haft Lang and the Chehar Lang, and which constitute two sections of the population differing to a large degree in tribal interests and manner of life. The Haft Lang preserve almost universally a nomadic mode of existence, while the Chehar Lang, formerly also nomadic, are now for all practical purposes a settled population, supporting themselves primarily by agriculture, and they form almost the entire permanent population of the tract dealt with in this hand-book. This does not preclude the periodic incursion of a large body of Haft Lang much exceeding them in number, who, however, again quit this low country for their upper pastures in the latter part of the spring. Each of these main sub-divisions is sub-divided into numerous clans, of which it is sufficient to say that the individuality and independence of these clans is more marked in the case of the Haft Lang than in that of the Chehar Lang. Up till near the middle of last century the hegemony of the combined tribes reposed with the Chehar Lang, but with the fall of the family of Muhammad Taqi Khan (see Layard’s “Early Adventures”), this state of affairs was altered. The supreme power then passed into the hands of the leading family of the Haft Lang, who have retained it ever since through several generations, and have employed it to establish the dominance of their own sections, and to reduce their rivals to a position of complete subordination. As matters now stand, the Haft Lang Chiefs administer the Chehar Lang through the medium of the relics of the house of Muhammad Taqi Khan, which survive in three principal families. The first in importance of these families is that represented by Khuda Karam Khan, residing at Kaleh Tul, the others being repre sented by Mahmud Khan and Muhammad Husain Khan, whose head-quarters are at Dalun and Munganun respectively. Between them these three men exercise, under the jealous supervision of the Haft Lang Chiefs, a limited control over the country lying to the south of the Mangasht Hills, and its continuation westwards, including the Halagun valley, as far (speaking roughly) as the borders of the ’Aqili plain. Some of the country they still hold9 in their own names, but considerable portions of it have been acquir ed by the Haft Lang Khans, by appropriation from the Chehar Lang or absorption from the neighbouring districts. It is need less here to specify the exact geographical division of the country amongst them, but it may be roughly stated that Mahmud Khan controls the extreme south-east as far west as the middle of Maidaud, the remainder of which is in the hands of Muhammad Husain Khan. The central portion of the district, including from Halagun to Bagh-Malik, is Khuda Karam Khan’s portion, while Muhammad Husain Khin’s control appears again at Gurglr, Tambi, and the tract to the west. The two latter own allegiance to the Sardar Muhtasham. Khuda Karam Khan to the Sardar As’ad. When these Haft Lang Chiefs are at a difference among themselves, their adherents are often placed in a very uncomfortable predicament, and this is especially so in the case of Khuda Karam Khan. The personality of these individuals might perhaps not be without importance, and the opportunity may be taken of men tioning that Khuda Karam Khan is much superior to his confreres, and is in every way a very favourable type of Bakhtiari: he is com paratively enlightened, does not obtrude at every ill-conceived moment the national vice of avarice, and always displays marked friendliness and frankness towards Englishmen. In certain con- jmictions of circumstances it is possible that his services might be readily secured, and might be of great value. All these men would undoubtedly be glad to be free of the yoke of the ruling Chiefs, which bears heavily on them, and they sigh for the days of their old in dependence. They are held responsible for robberies and disturb ances occurring in the country administered by them, and these difficulties are augmented by the presence, at certain times of the year, of various of the population over whom they have little, if any, power of control. These are the Haft Lang, already mentioned, and certain so-called Turk nomads, who are in a tributary relation to the Haft Lang Chiefs. Account has also to be taken, of the prox imity of the Kuhgalu, who besides marching with them on the south east frontier, share with them in the hot weather the elevated grazing grounds of the Mangasht range. Their brigandish pro clivities, favoured by their position of vantage, result in the Kuhgalu having to be reckoned with, on occasion, on the Isfahan road where it approaches the Mangasht; and on such occasions it is Khuda Karam Khan who has to make restitution if the Chiefs find themselves obliged to pay attention to the complaints of the robbed. G7 I. B. BThere is also a considerable resident Kuhgalu population, occupying the south-east extremity of the district. This tract has only been acquired by the Bakhtiari in comparatively recent times, in the course of a gradual process of aggression, which has left the original population undisturbed. These quondam Kuh galu fall principally within the sphere of Mahmud Khan, and seem to have acquiesced readily enough in their transference to the Bakh tiari, of whom it would appear safe to consider them now an integral part. Out of consideration for the strictly limited scope of the present work, the tribes have been viewed purely from a local standpoint, but it has been made clear that the forces ultimately governing and directing the affairs and conduct of the tribes have to be looked for farther afield. These forces reside solely in the Haft Lang ruling family, whose shadow dominates the whole country, and in whom centre the hopes and fears of the whole population. Besides controlling the domestic affairs and relations of the tribes,, they direct what may be called the foreign policy of the Bakhtiari, Towards the Persian Government they stand at once in the position of hereditary leaders of the tribes, owners of the land, and governors of the province, for the revenue of which they are, in virtue of patents of Governorship, held directly responsible. Two of their number hold formal appointments from the Persian Government under the titles of “ Ilkhani and “ Ilbegl ”, and the functions of these officials are analogous to those of the Governor of an ordinary Persian province. These appointments are much coveted for the additional authority which they confer on their holders, and they afford the only hold which the Persian Gov ernment has over them, By the successive elevation and deposi tion of different Khans they are able to foster those domestic jealousies and dissensions to which they are naturally prone, and to introduce a state of faction and discord which frequently makes united action or policy impossible, and reacts prejudi cially on their authority at home and abroad, This said, however, the means of control enjoyed by the Persian Govern ment have been fully stated, as it appears to have become con vinced of its inability to pursue any course of control or coercion entailing the use of force. The Khans on their part, while scoffing at the weakness of the Central Government, and declaring their contempt for it, in reality stand in very real fear of it, knowing by experience that their own domestic jealousies put them so far at its mercy as to make intestine war a constant menace, and ther 11 payment by conflicting Chiefs of very large sums of money to the ieiiran authorities a frequent necessity. While thus standing towards the Persian Government prin cipally in the position of provincial Governors, the Khans have relations with their neighbours chiefly in their more private capacity. VT/ i m ° St im P ortant extern al relations are with Shaikh Khaz’al ol Muhammareh, and are a constant source of discussion and apprehension to both parties. If of less potential importance, their re ations with their Kuhgalu neighbours have, in recent years, been more pregnant with actual results. In the present year (1908), having received the permission of the Central Government, sought without success, or perhaps the desire for success, for several years, to pro ceed against the Kuhgalu, they have undertaken formal military operations against them ; the operations have, however, been almost entirely barren of results, whether from intention or incapacity it is hard to say. ^ J Besides tins main line of external interests, occasions occur on which the Khans are brought into contact with the authorities of hushtar and Dizful, m both of which districts they own property and they have dealings from time to time with lesser and still ’Arabs* p0 ltlCal entltles suctl as Shaikh Farhan of the Bait Sa’ad Their relations with the Qashgai tribes, and with the Govern ment and religious authorities of Isfahan, do not call for detailed notice here. Passing from their position in the general scheme of Persian autonomy, it only remains to mention their relations with the British and Indian Governments, for it may be safely asserted that they have at no time had any intimate or practical connec tions with^ any other European Power. The consideration of these relations is reserved for a separate section. It will have become sufficiently apparent from what has been written, that any account of the Bakhtiari which did not deal in some detail with the methods and characteristics of the Haft Lang Khans, would be defective in its most essential aspect, and these cannot be elucidated without some reference to the factions and parties existing among the Khans, and the family and other reasons which have given rise to them. The Khans all belong to one common stock, into the origin or antiquity of which it is unnecessary to enquire here. B 2 |12 All those who now figure in the public eye as Khans, have only to look back for two generations to find a common ancestor in one J’afar Quli Khan, and in the generation preceding the present one they still find themselves concentrated in two brothers and an uncle. The family of the last named, if now not entirely negligible from every point of view, does not at any rate enter into the field of view under consideration, and attention need not be extended beyond the families of Husain Quli Khan, and Imam Quli Khan, also known as Haji Ilkkanl. These two brothers each held the Ilkhamship for varying periods during the eighties of last century, and each dying left a considerable family behind him. Jealousy has always existed between these two families, but it was held in abeyance for a long time during the combined rule of Isfandiar Khan, and Muhammad Husain Khan, the senior members of the two families respectively. Both men were possessed of considerable capability and wisdom, and worked together in unanimity as Ilkhani and Ilbegi. Isfandiar Khan died in 1903, after 13 years’ unbroken tenure of the supreme power, during the last 5 of which there was no one to dispute his authority,* and Muhammad Husain Khan, who succeeded to his offi- cial position, succumbed early in 1905 to an illness which has given grounds for some suspicion of foul play. The way to the dignity and responsibility of the Ilkhaniship was then laid open to the remaining brothers of each family, and their subsequent history presents a record of constant jealousies and intrigues, periodically terminating in the transfer and retransfer of the supreme power from the one to the other. These changes have only been accomplished by deputations to Tehran, and very liberal payments expended in obtaining the support of the various Persian Ministers, and the net result has been a great weakening of the political fabric of the State, the excessive embitterment of the rival Khans, and the aggravation to the last degree of that jealousy which may be expected between families of cousins similarly situated. Both sides have shown themselves equal ly incapable of producing an individual qualified by force of character and weight of personality to command any general influence. Reference to the genealogical table (Appendix V) will give acquaintance with the names and relationships of the various Khans. It is generally recognized that neither party can, even when the chance occurs under the most favourable circumstances, carry on * On his release from confinement in 1890 Isfandiar Khan was appointed Ilkhani ; but he was not able fully to assert his position during the life-time of ImSm Quli Khan- There was therefore some division of authority, at least in practice, and Imam Quli Khan has sometimes been represented as holding the Ilkhaniship from 1890 until his death, which probably occurred in A. H. 1315—1316, or about 1898 A.D., but is sometimes ascribed to the year 1896.13 the administration single-handed, and the custom approved both by the Bakhtiari themselves and by the Central Government is to combine an likhani from one family with an Ilbegi from the other. In recent years this custom has twice been departed from, but on both occasions it soon became necessary to revert to it. The combinations which have successively been tried since the spring of 1905 are—* IlJchdni. Samsam-us-Saitaneh (HQ). Sardar As’ad (HQ). Salar Arfa’ (HQ). Samsam (HQ). Shahab (IQ). Samsam (HQ). N.B. —HQ-house of Husain Quli. IQ-house of Imam Quli Haj Ilbegi. Shahab-us-Saltaneh (IQ). Salar Arfa’ (HQ). Mu’in Humayun (IQ), acting local ly in the absence of senior Cb iefs at Tehran. Shahab (IQ). Sarum-ul-Mulk (IQ). Shahab (IQ). Ilkhani. On two occasions (in 1906 and 1907 respectively), the rival fam ilies mustered their partisans, and, had thoughts of their property at stake not had an equally deterrent effect on both parties, the supre macy would certainly have been put to the arbitrament of the sword. As it is, the increase in their property, and their attachment to it, and their degeneration in manly qualities, seem to preclude the hope of any final settlement, which is only to be looked for in the result of a decisive contest of arms. The detrimental effects of their want of unanimity and noto rious jealousy, both on their administrative efficiency, and on their power to resist hostile intrigue from outside, can hardly be exaggerat ed. The tribes see in their mutual distrust the means of constituting themselves into a third party, whose good-will must be propiti ated before it will grant its support to either party. No Chief can rely on the support even of his own subjects, or, as they might be called, tenants, and the latter can frequently shelter themselves from disciplinary measures by threatening to desert to the other faction, and if necessary putting their threat into execution; while some sections, notably the Ahmad Khusraui, have made their support of such importance that they command very considerate treatment at all times. Generally speaking, the allegiance of the population is divided up according to the ownership of the land on which they live (though again it is questionable whether this operates fully in the case of * The Shahab was made Sardar MuhtaBham in 1908, and the Sarum-ul-Mulk became Salar-i-Jang at the same time.14 the purely nomadic sections); yet when it is remembered that the actual governing power is constantly passing from one rival faction to the other, involving a change in the source of general administra tive orders, it will scarcely cause surprise to find that the tribal sense of dependence on individual leaders is only developed to a low decree. The figure of a “ third party ’ ’ has already been used, °and the effect of the circumstances is in fact to produce a state of affa : rs not dissimilar from that obtaining where party government is in vogue, under which loyalty to the State may be combined with absence of respect for any leader, and a complete devotion to self-interest. Thus while the personal loyalty of the tribesmen to their Chiefs is despicable, and their inconstancy will eventually cause the down fall of their ruling class, and probably the loss of their autonomy* it is still not for a moment to be assumed that they would in con sequence readily acquiesce should any outside power, by attempting to remove their lightly-esteemed Chiefs, threaten the present form of independence enjoyed by the tribes as a whole. . This : however, is a side-issue, and the fact remains that the effi- dency of the Khans’ administration is prejudicially affected by the unreliability of their subjects’ personal allegiance, resulting from the discord which exists among themselves. It has already been pointed out that the same cause provides the Persian Government with an opening for interference in the affairs of the Chiefs: and the instability of any regime set up by them adds to the difficulty of coming to any understanding with their neighbours, such as Shaikh Khaz’al. Their short-sighted unscrupu lousness has even led them actively to cultivate the evils arising from their internal discord, and in the case of the Kuhcmlu it is well known that the two factions have understandings with different parties in that tribe, whose aid they on occasions invoke to embarrass the position of their rivals by the commission of robberies and dis turbances on the Isfahan road, for which the Ilkhani for the time being is held officially responsible. r f h ' 5re ' 3 ^ason to anticipate that time will tend to alleviate this state of affairs: on the contrary, in view of the large increase in the number of individuals concerned, due to the growing up of the families of the present senior Khans, each member of which claims the rank and status of Khan, it seems probable that the situation will become indefinitely aggravated by the multiplication of rival interests, and the perpetual sub-division of the property, which forms as it were, the capital of the concern. 1 ' ’The country, which can well support a handful of Individuals in comparative opulence, cannot furnish provision for a host of youths who add nothing to its resources and are constantly heading towards an increased standard of luxury and a more expensive form of life, while at the same time having to satisfy the importunities of the crowds of supporters, which, rightly or wrongly, they consider necessary to secure their interests. The situation offers much attractive food for speculation as to bow nwtters will develop in the next twenty years, but such speculation scarcely falls within the scope of the present review. A few remarks on the personalities of the leading Khans may not be devoid of utility. For their positions in the family tree reference should be made to the geneiiogical table appended (Appendix V). Muhammad Jawad Khan (Muntazzim-ud-Daideh) is a pleasant young man, and friendly to the British. He, however, has as yet gained no prominent place in the tribal councils, and appears to be deficient in vigour or force of character. Najaf Quli Khan (S imsdm-us-S Itoneh) is recognized as the ‘ doyen ’ of the Khans. He belongs in manners and mind to a generation that is passed. He is violent in his passi ms, and gener ally speaking blunt in his manner. He is spoken of in the country as an old-fashioned Lur, only good for conducting military opera tions. Though less averse from fighting than most of his juniors, his skill as a commander is not yet established beyond all question. He is not particularly acute, and is probably not infrequently fooled, or made a tool of by his relations. He is disliked by his brother, and loathed by the other family. He can, however accommodate himself to the Sardar Muhtash : m, and the antipathy of his family frequently leads to this result. He is a sworn enemy of Shaikh Khaz’al over an old dispute of no consequence. Haji ’All Quli Khan (Sarddr As’ad). —This man is acknowledg ed by every one as being the clever one of the Khans. He has read considerably in Persian and Arabic, and professes to read French, and he has acquired the tastes and manners of another society, by prolonged residence in Tehran. He is an inveterate intriguer, an indefatigable talker, and an opium-smoker. He has always refused to take up any official position, such as IlkhanI or Ilbeg!, probably on this account. But he has the confidence of the Khans, and since his return from Europe in February 1909 has controlled the policy of the Bakhtiari. It was solely owing to his influence that the Bakhtiari10 force of 1,200 men proceeded from Isfahan to Tehran to support the Nationlist cause in July 1909 ; for though the tribesmeu and most of the Khans ar 3 not anxious to take any part in Persian politics, the Sardar As’ad has ambitions, but in what direction it is hard to say. His chief affinity is for the Salar Arfa’. He has been to Europe once or twice. * Yusuf Khan (Sdldr-id-Hishmat) is a libertine and an in triguer : he does not appear much in public affairs, and his machina tions are therefore chiefly behind the scenes. He has visited Europe, and took a leading part in the Bakhtiari march on Tehran in 1909. Haji Khusrau Khan (SaYddY-uz-ZcifciT) is 9 man who wears his heart on his sleeve. He is quick in his passions, and easily misled, and so apt to commit himself in violent language. If hasty in temper, however, he is equally placable. He is compara tively straightforward, in pleasing contrast to most of his confreres. Like the Samsam he is sometimes fooled by the others, and incited to take up a violent tone to suit their purposes. He is the one of the Khans for whom perhaps it is most possible to conceive a liking. He has been to Europe, but does not read or speak any European language. Auldd-i-Hdjl Hkhdni. Ghulam Husain Khan (SaYddY MuUasham).—^^ man’s character is more complex. His lack of physical and moral courage has its complement in a decided absence of reliability in his words and deeds. He was for long considered as a mainstay of the British-Bakhtiari friendship, but in recent years he has decidedly forfeited this good opinion by the repeated breaking of the most solemn promises. His false promises are as a rule to some extent inspired by purely mercenary motives, but even if made in good faith, they are rendered abortive by his cowardice, which prevents his making good any promise that may be ungrateful to his colleague. Nasir Khan (SdldY-i-Jang) bears the reputation of being the pluckiest and most military of the Khans. He is a man of some force and determination, but until recently bas not come to the front except m a subordinate capacity. This is probably largely due to his being poorer in property than the Khans already mention ed, and hence having a direct hold on a proportionately smallsection of the population. While at the same time wanting in the prestige and power attaching to wealth, he is generally respected by the tribesmen for his manly qualities. Sultan Mahmud Khan (Sarddr AsJiraf) is own brother to the Sardar MuLtasham, to whom he is junior. So far as observation goes, he would appear to share his brother’s defects. He is conse quently not to be relied on. It is only under unusual circum stances that he comes into prominence. ’Ali Akbar Khan (Saham-us-Saltaneh) is a young man with out any other characteristics than those conferred by addiction to drink and women. As a force he is negligible. Muhammad Kiza Khan (Mu in Humdyun) is a pleasant young fellow, but without any particular force of character. Lutf ’Ali ¥A^\\(Sarddr Asltja’a) is believed to be the senior member of this family. He has long cut himself off from immediate connection with his country, having entered the service of the late Shah when he was Heir Apparent. He commanded the body-guard at Tabriz, and until recently held a similar position at Tehran. The Salar-i-Jang is his brother by the same mother, and these two usually work in combination. The combination is some times made to include the Sardar Muhtasham and Sardar Ashraf. The Sardar Ashja’a bears the reputation of being a good fighting man. Of the rising generation, the Muntazim-ud-Dauleh has already been mentioned. Murtaza Qull Khan, son and heir of the Samsam, also has some importance as being the son of a father whose decease cannot be remote. Among the remainder the Sardar Bahadur, eldest son of the Sardar As’ad, is reputed to exhibit signs of considerable capability. He has latterly (1908) been residing with the Sardar Ashja’a in Tehran. Of the Sardar-uz-Zafar’s numerous progeny none at present merit special mention. The other family has been much less prolific, and the only grown-up children aro Sultan ’All Khan (Shahab-us-Saltaneh) and Ghulam ’All Khan. The former has had some opportunities, but has not revealed any great capacity for affairs. (v) Strategical. sThe possibility of a Russian advance on India vid Persia has for long keen considered as a possible contingency by the Indian military authorities, and the activity of the Intel- 67 i. b. C.18 ligence Branch m Persia is largely due to this cause. Major Sawyer m 1891 recommended the adoption of a line of defence, against an invader from the north, which stretched from Parvlz to Su tan Ibrahim, on the north side of the Zagros mountains : the advantages of this line are fully set forth in his report. Its adop tion would, however, involve the employment of a very laro-e force operating m mountainous country, the inhabitants of which might be hostile. The difficulties of supply and transport would be great, and the advantages to be gained from the advanced position uncer tain. I he proposed line, moreover, would not cover a Russian advance ma Khurramabad and Dizful, and, if so out-flanked, it would be diflicult to alter the disposition of the troops in time to block this line of advance. ^ iS 0 ^ ne . defence suggested in this report is simply that of the Karun river from Pul-i-Shalu to Shushtar. (If the Russian objective should eventually turn out to be Dizful, via Khurramabad, the line of the Diz could be rapidly taken up.) ,,, Bou ^ d 5T 1 e^ b 7 the unknown and impassable Kuhgalu hills, and the Mangasht mountains, whose tops are snow-capped for 8 months out of 12, this line of defence would follow closely the north bank of the Karun, past Susan, Bard-i-Qamchi, Gudar-i-Landar, and G ^ a ^ d - t ? Shushtar * Its strength lies (1) in the natural features ° t i the g0 / ge ’ 111 lts communications. North of the line lies a broad belt of remarkably unfertile country, very scantily popu lated, and connected with the interior of Persia by only 2 or 3 possible routes. .From Pul-i-Shalu to Susan, the Karun runs in a narrow gorge, impassable throughout to pack animals, and only occasionally passable for infantry. At Pul-i-Shalu, the Isfahan- waz road crosses the river by a bridge; at Susan another practi cable road from the north crosses the river and proceeds to Malamir: the intervening space between these roads is wholly impracticable for troops, nor is there any choice of fords at either point. The Karun above and below Susan runs in a deep gorge, from which it only emerges for a few miles at Bard-i-Qamchi, If the river be crossed above Pul-i-Shalu, the Karun must be followed until Pul-b bhalu is reached, as there is no other possible road. At Bard-i-Qamchi a practicable road leads from the district of Andakeh to Malamir: here the river may be forded anywhere between Gudar-i-Qambu andBard-i-Qamchi, a_distance of 3 miles; but from Qamchito Pa- 1 v- i! 1 x andai i a g ft in runs in a narrow gorge, access to which from the north is impossible. At Pa-i-Pul-i-Landar, access to the river from the north is only possible via the Tang-i-Dulau, a narrow defile some 3 miles long, which a few hundred men could ho a against a large force, and which could be made impassable by19 \€l li t Mating- From Pa-i-Pul-i-Landar for some 40 miles the north bank is lined by a steep and impassable mountain ridge con sisting between Pa-i-Pul-i-Landar and Gudar-i-Landar, 6 miles down stream of a cliff which rises perpendicularly upwards of 500 feet from weM nigh impassable slopes. Access to the latter ford from the north is possible only by one road, that from Kaleh Zaras and this tract can be blocked without difficulty. FromLandartoCham-i-Nuqreh the gorge has not been exa mined, but it appears to be accessible from the north only at 2 or 3 points, and to be easily defensible. From Cham-i-Nuqreh to Gotwand the river runs m a gorge: along the west bank runs a prac ticable track which, however, may be effectually sealed at half a dozen points by a force stationed on the precipitous cliffs on the opposite bank, which are easy of access. It may be concluded that a force of 10,000 men could hold this line, and prevent a force advancing from the north from crossing the Karun, thus limiting the possible field of decisive operations to a point somewhere between Shushtar and Dizful. Lateral communications on either side of the river are much the same : they consist of tracks, practicable for pack animals and' keeping generally 8 or 10 miles from the river on the north bank or miles on the south bank. The advantage is with the south bank on the whole. Communications with the rear are very defective on the north bank, involving as they do crossing high passes, snow covered in winter, and unprovided with food or shelter. On the south bank practicable roads run from every ford southwards to the main centres of population, and thus to Shushtar and Ahwaz; this fact gives a force operating from the south an enormous advantage : with Ahwaz as a base, Shushtar and Ramuz as supply depots^ and advanced bases at Gotwand Gurgir, and Malamir, every ford would be within two days of its advanced base; and these points, in themselves cap. able of supplying large quantities of provisions, would be within easy reach of the main supply depots. J Supplies. It is elsewhere shown in this report that the district may be reckoned on to provision a force of 6,500 men, on the most con- seryative estimate, without trenching on the supply from the alluvial plains of ’Arabistan : such a force should be able to find supplies locally for an indefinite period, though climatic considerations make it most desirable, if not absolutely essential, that operations should cease m May. The fuel question would not arise as long as troops were quartered near the Karun, the driftwood on whose banks, and C 220 the trees on the hills in the vicinity affording a sufficient source of supply. From India to Muhammareh. —From Karachi or Bombay to Muhammareh is 5 or 7 days’ steaming, respectively, by mail. The British India Steam Navigation Company’s boats can carry about 200 horses and 800 men (the actual numbers vary with each boat). Only ships drawing 20' or less can oidinarily cross the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab and enter the river. At Muhammareh, which is in the angle of the junction of the Karim with the Shatt- al-’Arab, the large steamers anchor in the middle of the latter stream, and discharge cargo into lighters or barges. Half a dozen of these are generally available, and more could be brought down from Basrah if required. From Muhammareh to Ahwdz .—The British-owned Malamir and the Persian-owned Nusrat are the only steamers plying to Ahwaz.* The former can carry about 800 men or baggage up to 200 tons, but could not provide sleeping accommodation for this number. As the river can only be navigated by day, the troops could sleep on shore, a step in itself desirable as a tactical pre caution. A small force of cavalry, say a hundred on each bank, should escort the steamer. The boats used by the same Company (the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company, Ltd.; Agents, Messrs. Lynch) on the Basrah-Baghdad line could also be requisitioned. (See Appendix III). By utilizing the Malamir to carry all the baggage, however, and sending the troops by land, a force of at least 1,000 men could march up the river bank, drawing supplies every evening irom the boat, which would tie up at previously arranged places. Ahwaz could thus be reached in 4 days. This method would have the great advantage of enabling a force of some size to be concentrated at Ahwaz or at Shushtar without delay, Ahwaz being reached 10 or 12 days after leaving Karachi, and transport would be entirely dispensed with. The Shushan could be similarly utilized between Ahwaz and Shalili (8 miles south of Shushtar). The moral effect on such a rapid concentration cannot be over-estimated. Supplies and fuel could be obtained at Muham mareh, and probably in sufficient quantity at Ahwaz, though it would be advisable to ship one month’s supply of all require- * A third boat, the Blosse Lynch, will be put on the Karun by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company in 1910.21 ments, except fuel. As regards the latter, there are usually large stacks available at Ahwaz, Band-i-Qlr, and Shallli, as the Shu~ shan burns only wood.* From Ahwdz to Shushtar .—Transhipping cargo by the tramway at Ahwaz, the same procedure could be observed as far as Shalili, but it should be remembered that the Shushan can only carry about 80 tons of cargo. At Band-i-Qir, it would be convenient to use the ship as a ferry-boat, in order to enable troops to make use of the shorter and more fertile Mian-Ab route. Shushtar, Ahwaz and Bamuz once seized, the task of collecting food, fodder, transport, etc., would be commeuced under favourable circumstances, as these towns are the centres of commercial activity in the district. Muhammareh to Rdmuz .—In dry weather, a force unencumbered with much baggage could reach Ramuz from Fallahieh in 6 days, but the first two stages are partly by boat on the Marid canal, and partly over marshy ground intersected by canals, and would not always be practicable. A route could probably be found from a point some miles up the east bank of the Karun, which would be free from these obstacles. It must be borne in mind, however, that this region may be the objective of a force coming elsewhere than from the North. The Perso-Turkish frontier, an ill-defined line running nearly parallel to the Karun from near Muhammareh was mapped, but not demarcat ed by a Commission in 1865, and may still give rise to disputes. The construction of the Baghdad railway, and especially its pro jected extension to a point near Basrah, would give Turkey an enormous strategical advantage by enabling her rapidly to concen trate troops on the frontier. Muhammareh and Ahwaz, and in a smaller degree Shushtar, all lie open to aggression from the west;. and with consolidation of Turkey’s influence in Mesopotamia, which is likely to follow the construction of the railway, and of canals, aggression directed against Persian territory in these parts is not beyond the bounds of possibility. It must be remembered also that along the frontier there is no lack of inflammable material in the shape of semi-independent ’Arab tribes whose internecine disputes may be made the excuse for a forward movement. Our arrangements with the Shaikh of Muhammareh, and our interests in the Persian Gulf would not permit us to consent to an occupation of Persian territory by the Turks, and com * Arrangements are being made to burn crude oil in 1910—a great advantage from every point of view : the crude oil will be brought down from Maidan Minaftun by the pipe-line to Ahwaz. In this ease the wood supplies referred to will not be available.22 bined naval and military action may become necessary. In view of this possibility, it should be borne in mind that small boats can reach Fallahleh and Ma'shur from the sea, and that desert tracks lead from both places to Ahwaz (4 days), and Ramuz (4 days). The country on either side of the Jarrahl is fertile and supplies would be obtainable. If the object of an expedition from India were to punish the Bakhtiari, the occupation of Shushtar, Ramuz, Ahwaz and Muhammareh would be of little use, unless punitive columns were despatched into the hills, care being taken to distinguish, if neces sary, between the Chehar Lang and the Haft Lang. The seizure of Ramuz would, however, involve the loss of much revenue to the Bakhtiari Khans, and thus might be an effective instrument in our hands against the latter, with whom our quarrel would probably be, rather than with their subjects, (vi) Archaeological. Whilst recognizing that archaeology should probably find no place in a handbook professing to deal with a district from a military point of view, yet in view of the fact that the district has been but little visited by Europeans, off the beaten track, for many years, a summary of such archaeological remains as have been noticed may perhaps be admitted. From the topo- - graphical point of view they are not without value, as giving per manently fixed and generally known points in a country where such are singularly deficient. A study of these, scattered as they are fairly equally over the whole district, establishes one salient fact. At no very dis tant date, certainly in Sassanjan times, and probably to some extent up to the time of the Atabegs, the district supported a large permanent population living in well built houses of mortar and stone, cultivating the soil, often terracing the hillsides with a phenomenal industry, born no doubt of necessity, and utilizing to the full the waters of the various streams that water the dis trict. Ruined qandts of great age, broken dams, and fields clear ed of stones abound in valleys now given over to a few nomads. These remains indicate a period when the pressure on the land was greater than at present, and hill-terracing and irrigation had therefore to be resorted to on a large scale, in order to cope with the needs of a considerable population.23 The ancient inhabitants of the district seem to have been in close touch with the rest of Persia, for in several places the remains of ancient paved roads have been found running through the hills to the north and north-east. It should also be noticed that the inscriptions and sculptures found differ in no way from those found in other parts of Persia. The traffic was sufficiently great to justify the building of bridges across the Karun at several points, no mean undertaking, even in these days. The archaeological remains of the district group themselves naturally into three classes, and will be briefly touched upon as they fall under the heading of— (1) inscriptions and sculptures; (2) buildings; ;(3) public and general works. I • . i . - Inscriptions. The best preserved and largest inscriptions are found in the Malamir plain, in the Kul-i-Farah (1) ravine, and the ShiLaft-i- Salman, (2) north-east and south-west of Malamir respectively. The cuneiform inscriptions at both these places have been deciphered and reproduced in facsimile, with the translation of Professor Sayce, by the trustees of the British Museum. The inscription at Shikaft-i-Salman relates to the restoration of certain temples and the carving of sculptures by a king whose name Professor Sayce gives as Takhi-hi-Kutur. &gt; ; The Kui-i-Farah ravine in the lulls bordering the Malamir plain to the north-east contains extensive sculptures (Layard having counted no less than 341 figures) and some well-preserved inscriptions. The Tang-i-Saulak, east of Eamuz, near TasLun, off the Behbe- han-Malamlr road (No. 19), contains several tablets and some in scriptions: they have not been visited as far. as is known, since De Bode first saw them in 1842. They are described and illustrated in De Bode (3) at some length, but experience has shown the worthy Baron’s illustrations to bear, as a rule, little relation to the actual facts. j 1 2 (1) See Layard, ii, 12. (2) See Layard, 1.404, and Journal R. Q. S., 1840, xvi, 78, et teq. jj&amp;) See De Rode, 1,163, et seq./ u \ In the Gatmsir, but on the north side of the Karon, and beyond the scope of this book, sculptures and inscriptions were found at Tang-i-Butun in the Shimbar plain (1) by Layard (2). Buildings. This concludes, as far as is known, the list of sculptures and inscriptions in the district; ruins, dating from the Sassanian period in all probability, are far more wide spread, and are found in every part of the district. To attempt to describe them in detail would be foreign to the purpose of this book, but in some cases, where the ruin seemed of special interest, a description has been inserted in the Gazetteer which forms Part V of this handbook. In the Maiamlr plain Kaleh Gazhdimak (q.v.) has an undeserved reputation amongst the Lurs for its remains: it is a ruin,apparently a place of refuge, on the top of a hill overlooking the lake, and offers no points of interest. Other ruins, of the same kind, are common on the hills bordering the IVlalamir plain. Manjanik (3) (#. t\)inthe Bagh-Malik valley is a deserted ruined town of considerable size, on the banks of the Bulawas, the ruins of a bridge over which are still visible. The Darwazeh-i-Gach {q.v.) said to be a Sassanian toll gate, stands on the desolate gach hills some 15 miles south of Bagh Malik on the road to Maidaud, or near it (route No. 19). It is remarkable chiefly for being built entirely of gach, both the masonry and the mortar being composed of this substance, and it has stood the ravages of time extremely well. De Bode’s illustration (4) is grossly exaggerated. At Kai Kaus, (5) about 20 miles north-north-west of Behbehan, is a fine temple in an excellent state of preservation, known locally as ‘ ‘ Fil Khaneh ’ ’ or elephant house, and it no doubt dates from Sassanian times. Ruins of various kinds, on high mounds, dot the 'Aqili plain: and all over the country ancient forts, perched on the tops of the hills, indicate that, even when the population was larger, and more settled, tribal conflicts were not uncommon, and had to be provided against. Some of these forts, however, are of more recent construction and probably date from the time of the Atabegs, when fighting was no doubt common. 1 2 3 (1) Lat. ZWo’, Long. 4 9° 35', Elev. 3,150'.

(6) „ i, 345 also seen by Mr. G- B- Reynolds (of the Concessions Syndicate Ltd).Darrell Qileh, passed on the road from Bard-i-Qamchi to Ma]amlr, is remarkable for its ruined villages and terraced hillsides, and there is no doubt that the valley once supported a considerable popula tion. Masjid-i-Sulaiman is probably the best known of all the ruins of the district amongst the Lurs. From its orientation and from its general shape, which is described at length in Fart V, there seems no doubt that it was a temple; from its structure, it would appear to be pre-Sassanian, for there is no sign of the sms, 11 stones, cemented by tenacious mortar, which is said to be typical of the Sassanian period. It has given its name to the surrounding country, which includes Maidan Minaftun, the site of oil borings. Public Works. In Sassanian times the Karun appears to have been bridged at least at nine points : viz., Ahwaz, Band-i-Qlr, Shushtar, Gudar- i-Gazistun, Pa-i-Pul-i-Landar, Bard-i-Qamchi and Pul-i-Shalu. There was also a bridge at Susan and another between Susan and Pul-i-Shalu. A description of some of the above mentioned points will be found in Part V. At Ahwaz and at Shushtar the bridges, which were primarily barrages, were works that would do credit to any engineer of the present day. Of the two bridges at Shuslitar, the Pul-i-Diziul, which has only become impassable during the last few years, is a particularly fine piece of work. The deep canal or rather cutting, through which the Ab-i- Gargar runs at Shushtar was possibly artificially constructed in order to lower the level of the Shatait sufficiently to admit of the Pul-i- Dizful being constructed, the completion of which raised the level of the Shatait and thus forced water into the Darian Canal, which passes under the fort by a tunnel, and through the town by a deep cutting. A detailed account of the antiquities of Shushtar is, however, beyond the scope of this book, and reference should be made to Curzon, and to the Persian Gulf Gazetteer. All over the 'Arabistan plain, the remains of ancient canals can be traced, in tracts now absolutely desert, giving evidence of a skill and industry which finds no counterpart in modern Persia. A work somewhat similar to the dams at Shushtar, though on a much smaller scale, may be seen at Dzarreh {q.v. in Part III), where a barrage has been built across the Bud-i-Zard at a point where this river flows through a narrow gorge; the water was by this means raised some 50 feet, and diverted into an irrigation channel, which can still be traced for some distance along the precipitous face of the east side of the gorge.26 There are also remains of a considerable dam on the Batwand r r river about 3 miles north-east of Gui-Zar, in the 'Aqlli plain. vil Linguistic. Although in Ahwaz, and in the greater part of the ’Arabistan plain, Arabic is the prevailing tongue, yet in Dizful, Shushtar, and Ramuz, Persian is more commonly spoken, the inhabitants being principally Persians; whilst north of these towns, no other language is understood. Even in Ahwaz, the better class of ’Arabs speak Persian and Arabic with equal facility, and a knowledge of the Persian tongue suffices for all ordinary purposes. North of Shushtar and Ramuz, the prevailing tongue is a dialect, known as Luri, which consists partly of corrupt, partly of archaic Persian, together with a number of words whose origin is lost in obscurity. Throughout the Bakhtiari Garmsir, however, Persian is under stood and spoken sufficiently for ordinary purposes, though now f and again, in secluded valleys, nomads are encountered incapable of speaking, and almost incapable of understanding, ordinary Per sian. No glossary or grammar of the Luri dialect exists, and the sub ject has never been critically studied.PART II MILITARY CONSIDERATIONS.&lt; 29 ) . PART II. MILITARY CONSIDERATIONS. (i) General. The main lines of strategy which have been assumed as a necessary basis for this report have been discussed in Part I. It remains to consider in some detail the conditions under which military operations would have to be conducted, and the di ad vantages that would have to be combated. From an examination of the resources of the district tabulated in Appendix I, it will be seen that the largest force that could normally live on supplies obtain able locally is 6,500 men. The minimum force that could safely enter the district must be settled with regard to the probable hostility of the Bakhtiari. It is not likely that any serious organized resistance would be offered to a force of 1,000 men, but any less number would be exposed to danger, owing to the difficulty of arranging for the proper picketing of the hills, an absolutely necessary precaution in this district, where, in many places, a few men could hold up an army, unless the heights were first cleared. The country is hilly, and mountain warfare is well understood by the Bakh tiari. One thousand men is therefore the minimum force that could with safety be employed in the district. Guns, rifles, and home-made ammunition are everywhere common amongst the tribes, but their standard of marksmanship is low, their rifles and guns ill-sighted and in bad repair, whilst their ammunition is almost always of poor quality, suitable only for work at ranges of 500 to 600 yards. Breech-loaders have almost supplanted the older types, but the life of newer patterns in the hands of a Lur is not long, and probably not a dozen in the whole country would be passed as serviceable by a Chief Civil Master Armourer. The Bakhtiari, amongst them, could perhaps raise 20,000 men, of whom 10,000 would be armed after a fashion ; but this is the maximum, and such a force could not long be kept in the field, whilst their military value would be low indeed. Rent asunder by tribal disputes, and by the personal jealousies30 \ of their leaders, it is safe to rely upon their lack of unanimity: and their inability to make common cause against an enemy, even had they the means of resisting an organized army. Intoxi cated with their own words, they are convinced of their own valour and high fighting qualities, but in their tribal wars there is more talking than fighting, and it is safe to divide by ten any figures regarding the strength of enemies or the number of casual ties of which we may hear. Contact with the outer world has deprived them alike of pride of race, and of the ancient custom of hospitality, which was one of their greatest virtues. They are little enamoured of the Central Government, of the existence of which, indeed, they are scarcely conscious, but not likely to do anything towards its overthrow. They accept the domination of their Chiefs, the Ilkhani and the Ilbegi, without enthusiasm, but without resentment, nor have they much to complain of on this score. The Khans are as honest and enlightened as their subjects, and their failure to keep order and to prevent injustice is due rather to the failings of the Bakh- tiari than to innate turpitude. The people are not heavily taxed, but this is due rather to the inability of the Khans to extract more, than to their leniency. As things stand no combined action is to be expected from them, and although an alliance between the Khans and the Shaikh of Muhammareh is both possible, and from their point of view desirable, the heads of either party are too mutually distrustful of each other and have not sufficient autho rity over their subjects to ensure combined action for more than a few weeks.* This characteristic would make them particularly vulnerable if one party was required to assist the other in repel ling an enemy from his frontier: self-interest of the narrowest kind would control the situation. Moreover, the Bakhtiari instinctively dislikes the Arab, and this feeling is cordially recip rocated. As Colonel Bell wrote of them in 1884, “ every virtue is sacrificed at the shrine of the detestable vice of avarice,* ’ though this has no effect in making them industrious. Actuated by sordid monetary considerations, they would probably forego all resistance, if such a course appeared profitable. It may be hoped, therefore, that in the event of a Russian advance from the North, the Bakhtiari could be induced, by diplo matic means, to remain neutral, or even to take the offensive against them. If left to themselves, the tribes would probably divide into two parties, one to each side, and thus ensure that, * A treaty of mutual f iendship and defence was signed by Shaikh Khaz’al and the chief Bakhtiari Khans in 1908, but there ia little chance of it being more than adoad letter. (Fide Report, Vol. II.) ' &gt;come what may, some o! them would be with the winning side, and that all the money and presents that can be screwed out of either side should be theirs. As spies and guides, their services would be invaluable, and their good offices, at a price, would be essential if supplies were to be obtained without severe compulsion. It should be borne in mind that the Government of India has a body of Indian cavalry with fair acquaintance with the lang uage and customs of the country, in the shape of the ex-Consular Guards of the country, i.e., men who, having spent three years in the country on detachment duty with Consular Guards, have returned to their regiments. The services of these men as inter preters for supply columns, and to act as intermediaries between native troops and Persians, would be most valuable, and would obviate much friction. As guides, they would be of little value as a rule, though some Consular Guards, such as those of Ahwaz, have a good first-hand knowledge of a large area of country from Ahwaz to Dizful and Isfahan. (ii) Climate. The climatic conditions must be carefully weighed in deciding as to the season of year in which to operate in the district. From November to January the days are often chilly, and the nights usually frosty : the climate resembles that of the Punjab, and like it, is bracing and dry. From January to March heavy rain must be looked for, though its total volume will seldom exceed T in the year. The rainfall of the district is heavier to the North than to the South, and heavy rain frequently falls at Malamlr or Kamuz which has no counterpart at Ahwaz. Cold winds are also a feature of the winter season, and while they last inflict great discomfort alike on man and beast. There is however, no necessity to provide troops with more than the normal 1 ‘ Winter ’ ’ scale of bedding and clothing, and no discom fort will be caused by bringing the “ Summer ’ ’ scale into force from 1st April. From 1st May onwards the heat becomes very great, exceed ing that of the greater part of the Punjab, and troops under canvas would suffer. The summer is characterized by extreme dryness, and the nights are bearably cool. If it can be avoided, troops should not be kept in the country after May 1st, unless in proper huts.32 (in) Supplies. As lias already been mentioned, the district may be relied on to support, in a normal year, a force of 6,500 men, and trans port on the 'usual scale, with food, fodder, grain, etc. Appen dix I shows the figures on which this estimate is based. It will be observed that wheat, rice, and barley are not merely staples, but practically the only grains that can be reckoned on in sufficient quantity to be deserving of mention. Salt, pepper and other condiments are imported from other districts or by sea, and would be brought from India. The same applies to tea, sugar and all luxuries and medical comforts. Dates can be obtained in large quantities from Muhammareh and from the large towns, and are excellent for troops. Milk butter, (but not cheese) can be relied on in small quanti ties as soon as the demand has had time to influence the supply, Ghi, though regularly made, and sold in the bazars, is limited in quantity, and not always of good quality: it would be cheaper to bring this article from India. Dhall of satisfactory quality is not to be obtained in Persia. Meat (goat and sheep) would always be plentiful from November to March, whilst the nomad tribes are in the Garmsir, and could probably be obtained all the year round in sufficient quantity. It is usually good, and fairly cheap, as the nomad tribes are mainly pastoral and rely on their flocks to a great extent for sustenance. Beef could be obtained occa- aionally, but not regularly, as the utility of oxen as beasts of burden, and for the plough, gives them a special value. Unless the animal has been seen alive, and carefully inspected, beef offered for sale should be regarded with suspicion, as cattle are usually only slaughtered when at the point of death from old age or disease. This does not apply to beef offered for sale in large towns. Whilst corn is easily obtainable, the supply of flour would soon be exhausted if a large force entered the district, as the inhabi tants would probably be afraid to travel far to the water-mills with their grain. Mills exist on all streams with fairly regular flow of water, and are evenly distributed over the country : their distribution is shown as far as possible in Appendix II. Their destruction is, however, so easy, that it would be unwise to rely on them entirely, and it is desirable that sufficient hand-mills should be brought out with the force to render it, for a time at least, independent of the local mills. The out-turn of flour from a mill varies of course with the size of the stone, the force of water employed, and with other factors less easy to deter nine.33 lied ,ris en- nil les, in per ea, ^ar red 'ns, nti- ilj* in per lity ays bes ear ap, cks ca- i of less red inly ase. ion \\)i- lilla ter, ion ion 3ly&gt; gbt .ent size ,bors On the average, however, it is found that a mill working 10 hours 'per diem can grind about 1,200 lbs. of grain, under favourable conditions. The mills in each district appear to be sufficiently numerous to supply with flour as large a force as can be supported by the district in question, so little anxiety need be felt on that score. Small quantities of excellent mineral o*il, nearly as good as that sold in India for signalling purposes, is obtained from the ‘ ‘ White Oil Springs on the Sfushtar-Eamuz road. The quantity obtained is about 6 tins (commercial size) a day. The whole produce is at present sold in Shushtar. (See gazetteer note under this head.) Pack animals and horses are fed entirely on barley and bhusa, hay never being obtainable, and gram unknown. The bhusa is of indifferent quality in many places, as no arrangements are made by nomad tribes for preserving it from decav, the straw being piled together on the ground and left to rot, if it be not used bexore tbe next harvest. Its commercial value is usually very small, as it is not easily portable, and thus no market can be found for it. Under the influence of a regular demand, however, the price soon goes up to far above Indian rates.- The barley of the country is of fairly good quality, and, if necessary, could be issued ground in place of wheat flour. In most of the large villages, the Bakhtiari KLans have stores of barley and wheat, the collected tribute of the neighbour hood, and the expropriation of these would often go far to relieve the Commissariat, and provide the force with food, without incon- veniencing the inhabitants, who would sell other things more willingly if their own stores of grain were spared. Green fodder is obtainable in March and April of normal years, but in small quantity. Ninety-five percent, of the area 'under crops in the district is entirely dependent on rainfall, the failure of which in volves the failure of the crop. Sowing large areas is, therefore accompanied with an element of risk, which tends to restrict the output of wheat in favourable years, and this fact must not be lost sight of in estimating the capacity of the district to export .. T ^ ere is ' h° wever » no doubt that only the indolence of the Bakhtiari, and the absence of any sufficient incentive to exert himself, prevents the normal outturn of grain, even from this comparatively unfertile hill district, from being doubled. The whole district affords admirable grazing from March till the end of May, and very little bhusa need be consumed during these months. From the end of May onwards, the only grazing fit for horses and mules is afforded by the green shoots of the 07 I. B.34 reeds that grow in many ravines and valleys of the district. These reeds are eaten with avidity, and seem to be a good substitute for grass. (iv) Transport. The problem of providing transport for a force operating in this district is perhaps the •most difficult of the questions that would confront the Commander of a force on arrival at Shushtar or Ahwaz, for it has been assumed elsewhere* that, as far as these towns, transport by boat would be feasible and preferable to the use of mules. Camels are not numerous in the district, though it will be seen from Appendix II that a proportion of camels are employed in the Ahwaz-Isfahan traffic. Mules are numerous, of good quality, and obtainable in large numbers on hire under favourable circum stances. Donkeys are very numerous: every nomadic family, and most sedentary families, have five or six. Probably 95 per cent, of the traffic in grain and flour from country to town is carried on the backs of these animals, which possess many advantages over the mule for small owners. Small and unkempt, seldom fed with grain, except when in regular work, living on the scanty grazing afforded by the country in the immediate vicinity of the main routes, being allowed bhusa only occasionally, they are nevertheless driven from 16 to 24 miles a day, loaded with burdens of from 100 to 150 lbs. by tracks over which horses cannot be ridden. They are marvellously sure footed, and are never shod. Whilst donkeys are mainly in the hands of small owners, mules are in the hands, to a great extent, of guilds of muleteers, each man owning from 3 to 30 mules or more, but working together, and accepting collective contracts. A certain number of mules are in the hands of nomads of Luristan who breed mules extensively in the hills. The muleteers of this district have their head quarters at Shushtar, Ramuz, or Dizful, though they are generally to be found also in Ahwaz, whence large caravans start for Isfahan and Ramuz. The Persian muleteer looks after his animals well according to his lights, and those seen on the road generally seem to be in fairly good condition. It will be seen, therefore, that baggage animals are fairly plentiful, mules being in the hands of a few guilds of muleteers, and donkeys being widely distributed throughout the country. ♦Parti—Strategical.It would be difficult to buy large numbers of either, except at quite prohibitive prices, but unless prevented by fear and hostility, It is probable that muleteers would offer their animals freely for hire, as trade would probably be largely at a standstill in the event of an army being sent into the country. The normal rates of hire are shown in Appendix II. There is little doubt that to hire the animals required would be the most economical course, and the one most satisfactory to both parties. Ramuz could probably produce about 300, Shushtar 500, and Dizful 500 mules, and in every case the same number of donkeys, under favourable conditions, at a fortnight’s notice. One thousand donkeys could probably be collected from the country districts. ’Arabistan S. of Ahwaz is dealt with in “ Military Report on S. W. Persia, Part II.” As has already been described, the baggage of a force could be most conveniently taken from Muhammareh to Ahwaz by river, and similarly thence to Shushtar, and it is unnecessary to consider what transport could be collected at Muhammareh. Ahwaz, although not a centre for muleteers, is the starting point of many caravans to Isfahan and Ramuz, and mules are usually obtainable after some delay, but in this case the number available at Shushtar or Ramuz would be diminished. Mules carry about 300 lbs. in addition to their saddle and line gear, and various small articles belonging to their owners, and with this load march daily from 20 to 30 miles without undue fatigue or exhaustion. The saddle is only removed for a few minutes whilst the animal is being groomed, and serves to keep it warm at night. Sore backs are frequent, but they do not pre vent the animal from working; and mules working as regularly and as hard, and carrying such heavy loads would be even more severely afflicted were they using the Indian saddle. Clumsy as the 'pdlun appears, it has nevertheless many merits. It is strong, requiring no cleaning, and offers a large bearing surface, preventing an awkward load from galling the animal and mini mizing the pressure on the ribs by spreading it over a larger area, and enabling the loads to be placed high on the saddle. One of the chief causes of sore backs is thus obviated. The muleteer loads his animals skilfully and well: the load, secured by a single long rope, is arranged so as to ride as high as possible, and secured by a surcingle, which passes over the load and under the belly, being pulled taut through a ring and firmly hitched. Knots and buckles are alike unknown. This method is satisfactory in practice, and loads thus secured seldom give trouble on the march.36 Mules are picketed by tying the head rope to a longer one, which is stretched on the ground between two pegs. A curry comb is kept for every, 5 or 6 mules, and every muleteer has his packing needle and thread. Each mule has a large feeding bag holding 3 or 4 lbs. of bhusa. The whole gear weighs from 50 to 60 lbs. . . The gear of a donkey is very similar, but the pack saddle is lighter, consisting often only of several thicknesses of felt or rags stitched together. Grain and flour is usually carried in hhurjin, stout saddle bags of goat-hair, which ensure a steady and well-balanced load. Muleteers shoe their own mules, and a set of shoeing instru ments for every 30 or 40 mules is carried. (v) Communications. Reference has already been made (in Part I—Strategical) to the use of steamships on the Karim. A statement of the tonnage of boats in use on the river, and of boats which, though plying between Basrah and Baghdad, can nevertheless be used on the Karim, will be found in Appendix III, together with some remarks which cannot properly find a place in the body of the report. Wharves and loading appliances on the Karun are conspicuous by their absence* : all packages are man-handled on to the steamer or into the barges over planks connecting the ship with the shore. At Muhammareh there is a wharf of masonry, some 60 yards long but this can only be used at high tide (for the Shatt-al-’Arab is tidLl at Muhammareh). The banks of the Karun shelve steeply in many places, however, and the boat can usually approach to within 12 feet of the shore, making communication by a plank easy. The tramway at Ahwaz serves to transport cargo from Nasiri, to which place it is brought by steamer from Muhammareh, to the point on the river bank, just above Ahwaz,- whence the Shvshan starts for Shalilf. Its military value lies solely in its utility in this capacity. The rolling-stock consists of six trolleys, drawn by horses, and capable of drawing about a ton’s weight of baggage. The total length of the line is about a mile: it is the property of a Persian Concessionaire, who levies a charge of 3 krdns per ton carried. Further details will be found in Appendix III. Its extension to Band-i-Qlr or to Shiishtar has been mooted, but it is most unlikely that such a venture would prove profitable, and from a military point of view, an extension of the tramway offers no particular advantages. . .... ®^ ears or crane 5 ! on Messrs. Lynoh Bros', wharves at Ahwaz and Muhamraareh* to lift 4 tons or so, will probably be available in 1910,37 Telegraph and Postal facilities have been dealt with in the prefatory notes to Part III. The assumption by the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the control of the existing ’Arabistan Telegraph system between Dizful, Muhammareh, and Borazjun was sanctioned by the Shah early in 1909 and will become a reality in 1910. The whole line will be relaid on iron poles and properly supervised. Ahwaz and Muhammareh will thus be in direct reliable communication with Bushire, Tehran and Karachi; this should be a great improve ment on the present Persian service, which is seldom in working for many days together, and which is, moreover, inaccurate. It has been proposed to join Muhammareh by wire with Basrah, by a cable connection across the river at Zain, or opposite Basrah. Perso-Turkish jealousy may, however, prevent this scheme from taking practical shape. A Muhammareh-Fao connection has also been suggested, but the high rate per word (Rs. 2-8) from Fao to London, compared to the rate from Basrah (7 annas), does not commend this line to the commercial firms in ’Arabistan. (vi) Medical. [By M. Y. Young, M.B., Ch.B., (Concessions Syndicate, Ltd. South Persia).] Under the following headings a brief description of the more important medical details will be given. Diseases .—It may be said from the outset that so far as it is possible to observe there is no known disease which can be particu larly attributed to this part of Persia. The diseases most commonly met with in Western countries are infrequent here. Respiratory diseases, for instance, unless a sequel to some infectious trouble, are not seen much in this region. Taking one year’s figures, about 100 cases presented themselves, 80 of which were registered as bronchial, asthmatic, or both, 3 pneumonia, 2 phthisis, 6 pleurisy, and 9 pulmonary catarrh. It may be of interest to note that two of the cases with pneumonia, and the two phthisis patients, came from towns, Ram Hormuz and Shushtar. The villagers who live in black tents and exposed to all kinds of weather, furnished one case only, a woman who rode up to the hospital, with a double apical pneumonia. One cause, the Qaliun—or bubble bubble—is no doubt largely responsible for the predominance of bronchial asthma tic cases. The Lurs indulge in this to a very great excess, the smoke being inhaled direct into the lungs.38 Cardiac disease is still less frequent, three cases only having been reported during the year. It may be accounted for by the rarity with which the diseases usually responsible for it are met with. Further, in a country with no industries to speak of, and with little or no cause for undue vascular strain on the part of the natives, the infrequency of vascular disease in general is not sur prising. Malarial fever is prevalent, although this cannot be termed a malarial district. The rivers are nearly all flowing and marshes and pools of stagnant water are few and far between. Anyone who lived here for a time would not fail to appreciate the fewness of mosquitoes about, and close observation will reveal the fact as regards anopheles. There is little doubt that the presence of petroleum oil in rivers like the Tambi near Maidan Minaftun or the Putang and Rud-i-Zard near Ram Hormuz minimises their propagation to a very large extent,&gt;but during my frequent journeys through various parts of the country I noted their absence in many localities, even where no oil was to be seen in the neighbourhood. Malaria occurs in the form of an intermittent fever which is most frequent in the autumn and spring seasons. It is usually benign in character and not often relapsing. The remittent and other malignant types are much less in proportion, and out of 500 cases, for instance, about 100 included quotidians, cachetics and patients with enlarged spleens, the majority of which were cases of several years standing. The innocent villagers, most of whom never saw even a native doctor, sometimes describe their fever accurately enough ; Ruzaneh (Quotidian), Sih-yak (Tertian), TaU i-suls (Quartan), &amp;c. Generally, few Europeans escape an attack of the intermittent type, which occurs as a rule in the spring or autumn, and is easily controlled with the usual remedies. Ophthalmic diseases are also prevalent, and due no doubt to the high sand storms, especially on the plains, and to the glare of the sun. Ophthalmia, keratitis, corneal ulcers, iritis; staphylomata and cataract are very frequently seen. Among Europeans who protect the eyes from sand and glare by the aid of goggles no eye affections were recorded. Digestive troubles form perhaps 50 per cent, of all the cases met with. Constipation prevails mostly in the summer, and not infre quently favours an attack of fever which a smart purge will cut short. Diarrhoea is not so prevalent. Stomatitis, gastritis, acute and chronic, and dilatation of the stomach are most common, and probablydue to unripe fruit (melons, limes, &amp;c.), which the natives relish, and to the large quantities of water consumed by all classes during the summer. Uncleanliness of teeth and the nature of native foods, especially in towns, are even more responsible for the trouble. In Shushtar, for example, I gather that the main diet of the popu lation consists of one, or all, of the following:— (1) “Halim, ” a mixture of meat, grain and water. The meat is mostly that of animals killed in a dying state from disease or injury. Earthenware jars, some small, others 3 to 4 feet in height, receive this mixture. The bot tom of the large jars is reached at rare intervals, some times weeks—for when some of its contents have been served, and occasion afforded new meat, a fresh quantity would be added. The jar is rarely ever cleaned, and it would seem that its supply has no end. (2) “Kaleh Pacheh ,, (sheeps trotters). The heads and feet of animals are collected, mashed up, cooked and treated as above. (3) “ Shir-birinj * * milk and rice cooked and prepared for weeks ahead. A menu such as this requires no comment. It may be said, however, that this pertains to Shushtar and also Dizful, more so, perhaps, than to any other place. In Ahwaz and Ram Hormuz the inhabitants do not indulge so largely in this diet, and in the villages, bread, chickens, rice, eggs, milk and its derivatives are more freely taken advantage of in their fresh state. All these articles are nevertheless very inferior in quality. Parasitic diseases, chiefly intestinal, are very common. The Cestode and Nematode groups predominate as a rule during the summer. In 1908, during June, July and August (water-melon season), the Ascaris Lumbricoides was highly prevalent and very few patients presented any symptoms. The majority of the natives expelled them accidentally and would bring them to the dispensary for show. In other instances the signs were obscure, but there is one prevailing symptom which seems common among all Lurs— a copious flow of saliva during sleep. This was usually sufficient to bring them to the dispensary saying “Kirm daram”—‘I have worms. ’ In the largest number of such cases worms were expelled. Filaria Medinensis deserves mention as it is met with at intervals. Dysentery is seen in its veryfmild form only and generally among children. During the winter 1907-1908 no cases of dysentery were recorded. No epidemic of the disease is known to have occurred either prior to, or after, the establishment of our medical department here.40 Antenna, not caused by malaria, occurs almost with the same frequency among men as it does among women. It is chiefly se condary to chronic gastric trouble, the pernicious type being rare and only one case has been recorded so far. ’ Bright's disease is more common among the upper classes than the lower, and there is little doubt but that their indulgence in alcohol and opium largely contributes to its prevalence amongst them Alcohol is as freely taken by the well-bred women as it is by the men. A bottle of whisky, brandy, or more often arrak, of native manufacture, once commenced, is usually emptied by one person in an evening. This may be repeated night after night till illness stops its further use for a time. The opium habit is also very strong amongst them, but in this respect many among the lower classes are as bad. &amp; Diabetes is commonly dealt with in the same class, though several cases have been noted in the poor. The great majority are most obstinate cases to treat, as natives are very fond of sugar and rarely give it up. 6 Venereal disease is generally prevalent in the towns, to which most cases can be traced. In the outlying villages it is one of the diseases met with least of all. Happily most patients present them selves early, as the disease is well known among the natives They take mercury well, but in the hot season it must be given with some caution or perhaps stopped for a time, because mercurial- ism is apt to develop very rapidly. Very few cases of Congenital Syphihs presented themselves here. Those that I have seen came from Earn Hormuz, Shushtar or Dizful, chiefly children, whose Inter, stitial Keratitis urged their parents to bring them. Infectious fevers do not seem largely distributed notwithstanding the state of filth the natives live and thrive in. In towns like Shushtar or Dizful one would have expected to find more typhoid than is actually the case. In the summer it is even less frequent than during the winter, probably owing to the heat which dries up so rapidly all foecal accumulation in the streets and fields. Old malarial cases are often subject to the disease, but on the whole it cannot be said to be marked either in the towns or the rural districts here. Measles attacks many of the native children, and probably a larger number die of it than is actually known. Small-pox occurs now and again, but I have not heard of any epidemic of the disease. Vaccination is of course unknown here. In Shushtar, Meningitis (?) is said to be the cause of a large number of deaths in the spring and summer^ but m the absence of medical opinion on the nature of the disease, it is questionable whether this is authentic.41 , Plague has not been heard of for many years. Quarantine regulations have been long in force at Muhammareh in the hands of a British Medical Officer under the orders of the Besidency Surgeon, Bushire. In 1904 there was an outbreak of Cholera in ’Arabistan and part of Bakhtiaristan, but with what death rate it is impossible to ascertain. It is fair to mention that it did not originate here, but was probably imported from Baghdad, Basrah, &amp;c., where cholera was severe at the time. Rheumatism. —It is sometimes surprising how often one meets with this disease even in the dryest season. It is commonly chronic and not a sequel to the acute form, which is rarely seen. Scurvy deserves mention. Vegetables are not often obtained by the village population; besides, for many months in the year, they are wanting altogether, except perhaps in towns where water is plentiful and they can be grown. Yet natives of the country are very rarely attacked by the disease. I have seen, however, a few cases among the Indian troops stationed at camp Maidan Minaftun, when vegetable matter was unobtainable, being unfit for use if brought from a distance. SJcin affections of all varieties are met with daily. Eczema, urticaria, furunculi, prurigo, pemphigus, and ringworm are all very common. Lupus is rare as also is leprosy. Of elephantiasis only two cases have been observed. The oriental sore, or wdiat is here known as the Baghdad ulcer, is often met with. It is ques tionable whether it is endemic to the district. Nearly every case I saw affected patients who contracted the disease either in Bagh dad or Basrah. Europeans seem to be attacked by it as readily as natives, and those cases that were seen never visited an endemic area. It is not severe. The extensor surfaces of the legs and forearms are the usual sites, and the autumc—October, November— is the season when it may be expected. Surgery. . The rapidity with which surgical wounds heal, particularly in the summer, is worthy of note. It is noticeable in abdominal, and to a less extent in bone, affections. One case of appendicular abscess (about 20 ozs. pus withdrawn) was perfectly well on the 17th day after operation. All wounds are dressed dry in the hot weather when no dressings will remain wet. Guttapercha tissue is destroyed by the heat. The draining of wounds is sometimes troublesome. Gauze when inserted dries up shortly afterwards and acts as a plug. India rubber tubing will not keep except under water, and unless there is much pus or secretion it may dry in the wound, crack, and become an undesirable source of infection. 67 i. B. f42 Fenestrated glass tubes answer the purpose best, and should be employed here during the summer in every possible case. In all cases, more urgently so with small wounds without means for drainage, it is of advantage to have the dressings changed morning and evening when the edges can be slightly separated with forceps. Most wounds will granulate in a few days by the use of 1 in 25 carbolic acid 'on the first day, and then daily 1 in 40 with some boric-iodoform as dusting powder. In the case of deep abscesses with small incisions, a few times syringing with same solutions will greatly accelerate the process. A small piece of lint soaked in hazeline and applied for a few days will often tend to hasten cica trization. Of abscesses, those on the palms and fingers, and also of the soles, deserve mention from the frequency with which they have to be dealt with. They affect chiefly those whose occupation compels them to handle material (iron, &amp;c.) heated up by the sun, but others are not exempt. In most cases there is not even an abrasion of skin to permit of infection, and contact with the hot article under a tem perature varying from 130-160° F. seems sufficient. Some non conducting material to protect the hands would perhaps prevent this trouble, and the experiment will be watched at our works where it is being instituted. ^ The native footgear {giveh), which the Lur can use with impunity, however cooling and comfortable in a house or tent, should never be worn here in a long summer’s march. Comfortably fitting boots, even if warmer, will protect the feet from abscesses much more effectively. Bullet wounds and general injuries if taken in hand early will heal well and rapidly in the hot season under ordinary, precautions. In the winter healing is much slower and not much different, I should think, from any other place. The Lurs are anything but attentive to bandages, and they will frequently remove them;, ex posing the wound to satisfy their curiosity. Much unnecessary trouble arises therefrom. The cases of bullet wounds (as a rule in the limbs) that consented to be detained in hospital, usually recovered in from 5 to 20 days, according to size and severity of the wound. Ulcevs account for about 60% of all the dressings done at the dispensary in the autumn and winter when the tribes come down from the north. Many are neglected suppurating sores, and not a few are specific in those who are in frequent touch with towns. Some may resist treatment for a time, but they will heal with or dinary means if the patients persevere. Unfortunately they do not do so and depart immediately improvement commences, to return in a worse condition.43 Vesical calculi are more frequently seen in Dizful, Sfisan and neighbourhood than in any other neighbourhood here. Many of the natives seem to raise objections to their removal supra-pubi- cally, their notion being that the whole abdomen is cut open for the purpose., The perineal operation appeals to them much better and they will submit to it more readily. Tumours presenting themselves for removal are more often simple than malignant. Carcinoma seems exceedingly rare, and the one case seen at the dispensary did not belong to this part of Persia. Hernia, Hydrocele, Varicocele, Fistulce, coTomorily met with everywhere, call for no special remark. The more serious abdo minal cases, however, notably liver abscesses, are very few. Midwifery practice is withheld from the practitioner by all classes, native women being usually attended by the older mem bers of their sex. The upper classes may send for assistance when danger arises, but this is rare. Deaths from labour occur, and such reports reach the dispensary from time to time. Mammary affections of many varieties often come up for treatment. The natives take chloroform well, and those that tasted it once will clamour for it on behalf of their friends who may be suffering from a small abscess in the hand or finger. Notwithstanding the very high temperature in the summer, chloroform keeps very well. It may not be out of place to mention that all rubber instruments should be avoided here as far as possible. They are kept with difficulty in the summer and then they do not last. In a climate so exceedingly dry as this, metal is of the utmost value. Climate and Health. The general division of the year into four main seasons is here as follows : summer, from mid-April to mid-October ; winter, from December to mid-February; spring, from mid-February to mid-April;, autumn, from mid-October to December. But this division is only approximately correct. In 1908 the hot season set in much earlier than in 1907, and May and June proved to be much - hotter than in previous years. It is about this time that the hot winds make their appearance, and though the natives reckon 40 days as the time they last, it may be said with little hesitation that they prevail throughout the summer. They are most severe at the com mencement, and perhaps for the six weeks following, but they never disappear altogether before at least the middle of September. The44 heat begins in May when the thermometer gradually rises from &gt; ’ about 90° F. to 124—126° F. in the shade in August. It may be said that for about 4J months in the year the temperature registrations in the shade are never under three figures. The summer nights are cool as a rule, but they can be very warm at times, notably towards the end of each lunar month. June, July and August are very depressing, but those more accustomed to the climate will feel the gradual change in September, towards the end of which the thermometer falls to about 95° F. in the shade, and the nights become appreciably cool. Nevertheless it is still very warm in the day time and in the sun, even during the month of # October. The rains usually commence in November and continue till April, though in 1907 they were unusually few and far between, and there was no rainfall to speak of from the end of January onwards. It is coldest from about the last week in December to the end of January, during which time the thermometer may fall even to 15° F., &gt; and everything may be frozen on the ground, but this is irregular, and about 24° F.—35° F. was the average record last winter in the neighbourhood of Ram Hormuz. The rainfall in the year is reckon ed to be about 7 inches. Cold winds and storms can be, at times, very severe. The spring and autumn are exceedingly pleasant and bracing, but then is just the time when intermittent fever is most prevalent. The climate of this country in relation to the general health of the population is on the whole very favourable. The summer, in spite of the great heat, is perhaps the healthiest time of the year, and the same may, to a less extent, be applied to the winter. The hottest and coldest times in the year seem to be the healthiest, pro bably because greater care is then exercised in protection from ex ternal influences. It must be remembered that the migration of the tribes bears an important relation to the diminution or increase in disease during certain seasons. In the first place, the popula tion becomes increased and decreased according as they come, remain, or leave. Secondly, and following upon this, the amount of disease becomes varied with its distribution. The tribes usually move from Chighakhur in November and leave this part in April. Travelling in the hot season should be done in the early morn ing and evening only. Tents are exceedingly hot in the day time and could not be recommended for prolonged use. The great heat of a tent increases the consumption of water to the extent of causing chronic gastric trouble. It would probably do harm even if it were of the purest quality, which unfortunately is not always the case.Houses, where they can be obtained, are much cooler than tents, but even they are far too hot for use in the day time. Underground dwellings are largely used by natives in towns and they are certainly cool and comfortable. Such places are easily dug out in the hills of Bakhtiaristan, and they can be readily and cheaply made by troops if stationed there for a time. I have personally made use of one and took note of others who did the same. I cannot speak of any ill effect they produce so long as food and water are rigidly kept out of them. Otherwise they form an attractive nest for mosquitoes, with which they become infested in a short time. When the sun temperature was 159°F. the shade temperature 126° F. and the room 114° F. the underground place, about 9 feet in depth, was only 90° F. Obviously, they can be made cooler or not as desired, the reduction in temperature varying with depth and site, but I should recommend 75°—80° F. as being comfortable enough and compatible with health. Lower than this may be undesirable, for the contrast between it and the temperature outside for those who must leave it in the day time cannot be lost sight of altogether. It is the hot winds one is most anxious to avoid, and often can not except in an underground habitation. It may be beneficial to mention that in a march some caution should be exercised with respect to them. There are authentic reports of three deaths, one in June 1907 on the road between Ahwaz and Ram Hormuz, and two in June 1908 between Shushtar and the same town. From enquiry into these cases, there seems to be a certain current of hot air, usually from a south-east wind, which by a sudden drying up of glandular secretion in the throat may cause death by asphyxia. One cannot say how far this cause is founded on fact, but whether it is likely or not, it goes without saying that a supply of water must be plentiful when hot winds are severe. In such cases the natives seize their water skin pressing it to their lips and nostrils thereby cooling the inspired air for the time being. Fortunately, these waves of hot wind are rarely so severe and lasting as to have a fatal effect, but the fact is perhaps worthy of note. So far all Europeans who have travelled and lived in the coun try for many years, some in tents, others in houses and dug-outs, have enjoyed good health notwithstanding climatic discomforts. The Patients. There are chiefly three classes of patients here which are more or less distinct from one another :— (1) The 'Arabs. (2) The Bakhtiari resident in the country throughout the year.47 ankle where pain seemed severe. In the outlying districts natives are still possessed of the notion that every European is a doctor, and they continually apply for medicines. Those who have seen Euro peans have by now learnt the distinction, and the doctor’s work is cut out for him should his identity be made known to the inhabi tants of a district through which he may desire to travel. it iePART III.

U zi With one or two exceptions, noted in the text, the country is everywhere very deficient in fuel, which is of poor quality, and brought from a considerable distance; a force of over 100 men would find it difficult to obtain sufficient fuel m the villages, and could not obtain it elsewhere without great delay. “ Fue i ve ry scarce ” should be assumed in every route report, unless otherwise men tioned. 8 .

Ahwaz to Isfahan via Kaleh Tul (as far as MalamJr). Epitome. General. —The main caravan route of the district built by the Bakhtiari Khans in 1898—1903 through Messrs. Lynch Bros, (now “The Persian Transport Co.”). Used both in summer and winter, but partially blocked by snow and closed to camels during the winter months. A mule track, and in places difficult even for mules, but nevertheless used to some extent by camels. The road. —(1) To Salmioh : fit for all arms, across flat barren desert plain ; sandhills at Nihairieh offer no serious obstacle, and the Concessions Syndicate ran carts regularly to Mamatain via Wais and this place. No other portions fit for wheels. (2) North of Salmieh : a mule track, difficult in places, but never impassable except for a few hours after heavy rain. The track goes from valley to valley, never rising above 3,000 feet. Climate .—Good in winter and spring ; no snow. Frost at night in winter ; in summer, great and continuous hbat by day, but fairly cool nights : atmosphere very dry: the heat would make it most undesirable to conduct military operations in the district during? the summer : during which time, moreover, the country is almost deserted, and largely waterless.

Regiments should have the usual proportion of “ tanks, water,” but one extra canvas bucket per 10 men for storing in camp or some other receptacle holding water in the pro portion of % gallon per head should be supplied. Grazing .—Poor and scarce, never sufficient of itself for mules, not particularly favourable for camels, but enough for donkeys during the spring in a normal year. In summer insufficient for any transport animal: a full ration of bhusa and grain should in any case be arranged for. No special poisonous plants are common. No regular fodder stores, bhusa is as often as not left to rot on the ground.56 Route No. 1—con/i. JPW.—Plentiful only at stages 6 . 6 and 7. Transport .—Camels used on the road in small numbers. Mules and donkeys very largely used. Caravans of 200 animals not uncommon. A day’s barley usually kept in band, but bhusa is rarely loaded. Mules are hired at rates varying from 2| to 4 krdns per mule per day. Camels at 3 to 5 krdns. See Appendix II for Eoad Statistics. Shoeing can be done sometimes at Ahwaz and Ramuz, and usually at Shush tar, but it would be necessary to bring out nalbands and horse shoes, etc., sufficient for all the horses of the force. The usual Persian shoe can be obtained in the above towns for the use of mules : it is well suited for horses in the hill country also, but the large size required by Indian horses is not easy to procure in any quantity. Purchase of large numbers of animals would be difficult to arrange, and it would be found best to hire the animals, and permit the owners to make their own arrangements as to feeding, etc., as far as possible. Caravans march by day in winter, mainly by night in summer.- Donkeys are usually given 21b, mules 61b barley per diem when in full work. Bhusa ad lib to mules, and a certain quantity to donkeys, to supplement poor grazing. Mules are seldom grazed except in April and May. Physical obstacles .—No repairs could fit the track for wheels. Fit throughout for pack animals, but stages 3 and 5 would require repair if in regular use by an army. Each stage would occupy a Pioneer regiment for not less than a week. No blasting: local labour the worst in the world, expensive and scarce. Very few tools available, and would have to be supplied from the field park. Alternative stages .—Raghaiweh near Salmieh. Qalgah, near Chashmeh-i-Raughanl. Bagh Malik and neighbourhood, near ’Aala Khfirshid. Miscellaneous .—A reliable map of this route was made in 1899—1902 by Mr. A. B. Taylor of Messrs. Lynch on the scale of 1 inch==l mile. Copies in possession of Intelligence Branch and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz. Camping grounds are easy to find anywhere in the district at any of the stages mentioned in this and other routes, and should cause no difficulty to a force of 2,000 men. Names of stages.

General.--A main caravan route, in competition with water borne traffic on the Ab- i-Gargar, and Karun. The road runs over flat barren country, keeping to the east bank as far as Band* i-Ql , where it crosses^ the river and proceeds up the Mianab, the tract of country between the Ab-i-Shatait and Ab-i-Gargar. Fit for carriages in dry weather, to within 12 miles of Shushtar and passable for animals at all times, though in wet weather progress is impeded by the heavy mud which forms all over the surface of the plain. -SwppZies.—Plentiful at Ahwaz (see No. 1 ) and at ShQslitar. At the latter place 1,000 men could bo fed without difficulty and without draining other districts of their supplies. Fuel.—Nil locally, but obtainable from the banks of the Diz River. Large stacks of fuel (for the use of the Shushan) are usually to be found at Ahwaz, Band-i-Qir, and Shalili. Transport. —At Ahwaz see No. 1. At Wais, perhaps 50 mules. At Shushtar, probably 500 mules and twice as many donkeys could be obtained on hire in a fortnight’s time. Shushtar is a centre for muleteers, and a few mules could always be obtained at once. Physical obstacles. —The Karun has to be crossed at Band-i-QTr . no special difficulties. Ono ballam (native boat) and some native sailing boats {mahela) are oftep obtainable, and could be used for the purpose. Alternative stages. —From Wais or from Band-i-Qir it is possible to diverge east-north east, and keep on the east side of the Gargar, which is not crossed until Bulaiti outside Shushtar is reached. This route is some 8 miles longer, and as between Band-i-Qir, or Waise, and Shushtar by this route no villages or permanent encampments are touched, and as the river bank must be avoided on account of the maze of deep ndlds in the tract known as “ Kharran ” the route offers no advantages. It is noteworthy that a cart road, keeping well east of the river, was made by the Con' cessions Syndicate, Limited,from Ahwaz to Batwand (see map) and from Darreh Khazineh to Batwand. This road could be extended to Shushtar without difficulty. © Distances. No. of stag Names of stages. Inter mediate. Total. 1 Wais ,, 16 16 General direction north-east.

A. T. Wilson, May 1908. Epitome. General .—Part of a track once of commercial importance from Shashtar to Isfahan which does not cross the Karun. It has been replaced by the Lynch Bakhtiari road (No. 1) as far as commerce is concerned, but is still largely used by nomads between the hills and the low country. Not used from November to March beyond Kaleh Bazuft owing to snow on the passes : but as far as Susan used all the year round. Fit for mules and donkeys only. The road is difficult in many places, and encounters several fords which frequently give trouble. Supplies.—kt Susan, Kaleh Zaras and Gotwand only. At the first two places Ur 200 men and transport ; at Gotwand see Index. Water .—Plentiful throughout, but occasionally scarce in summer. Physical obstacles .—None of importance to mule traffic ; it could not be fitted 'for wheels without excessive labour. L 284 Route No. 29— concld. No. of stage. Names of stages. Distances.

Leaving Malamir strike across the plain on a bearing of about 15° to a large Tang which furrows the south side of Kuh-i- Gelgird, a few hundred yards east of Kaleh Gazhdimak. The bottom of this Tang is reach ed at 5 miles. Ascend the Tang by a steep and difficult track, m very bad repair, but showing here and there signs of having once been properly constructed, probably in Sas- sanian times. The summit, height 5,500', is reached at 7| miles. Thence descend 2,500 by an even more difficult track fit for lightly laden mules only, to the distance of Talao and follow a track along hillside to a low pass reached at 13 miles. Continuing down a well wooded ravine at 14 miles, a small spring is passed, hidden by willows (the only ones in the vicinity), and near it several huts. This is a good halting place as the road has hitherto been bad for animals. Water from the spring, grazing good, supplies nil except in winter, when the huts are inhabited, fuel very plentiful. Susan 8 22 General direction north-west. Leaving the spring two roads are avilable. One keeps to the hillside and reaches Susan via the fertile Potoi valley, visible from close to the spring. The other descends towards the Susan valley, keeping to the north of an isolated hill in the valley, which blocks the view of Susan. A graveyard ^tb stone lions is passed at ] mile, after which the track, following the course of the Karun at about 1 mile to * mile distance, reaches the first rice cultivation at about 5 miles, by an awkward stone pavement over a spur jutting out into the river. The Imamzadeh is reached at 8 miles. The Susan valley contains some 800 to 1,000 acres rice fields, and is inhabited in summer by 150, in winter by about 500 families. Supplies considerable all the year round. Gardens, fruit plentiful in season; a ferry ; cattle numerous all the year round. See Gazetteer.

General .—A route of importance as the best road for all concerned to Susan, whence tracks lead to Kaleh Bazuft (3 marches). In conjunction with No. 29 it is used by many tribes, particularly those of the Malamlr plain, who use the Susan ferry. It further gives access to the fertile rice-producing district of Susan. The road difficult, but practicable for mules and horses, not camels. Supplies in summer plentiful at Susan, nil elsewhere ; in winter, plentiful at Susan, scanty elsewhere from nomads.

This gap is reached at 6 miles. The road now becomes stony butnotdiffi- cult, and passes amongst the undulating low hills of the Piyun district, gradually bending more and more to the north, and crossing numerous n&amp;lds. At 14 miles the summit of the broad backed Kuh-i-Chila is reached, and the Susan valley is seen to the north-east. The road , now stony and difficult, descends to the valley ; at 17 miles rice fields are reached and at 18 miles the Imamzadeh. {See route No. 30.) The route above described is the better of the two roads from Malamxr to Susan, though it appears to be the less used. Route No. 32. Muhammareh to AhwIz by the left bank of the Kar^n River. Authorities and dates.—B aird, 1906. (Annotated by McDouall, 1907.) Epitome. General .—The route merely consists of a track across open uncultivated ground, passing, as a rule, within a mile, or so of the left bank of the Karun. The use of this track is chiefly confined to messengers moving between Muhammareh and Ahwaz; these generally follow this route between Ahwaz and the Marid stream crossing the Karun by ferry at that point. There is little caravan traffic on this route, as most of the traffic between Muhammareh and Ahwaz is carried by boat. After rains the whole of the country passed over becomes sodden and heavy, making the going difficult, and, it is said, some times impracticable. The soil on both banks of the river is the same.87 Route No. 32— contd. but tho ground on the left bank is said to be more liable to inundation than the other. Certain parts of the ground passed over are impregnated with salt, and these are said to be worse than the remainder after rain. Total distance. —Sixty-two miles in 4 stages. Supplies .—Supplies may be considered as being non-existent. The few villages that are met with lie within 16 miles of Ahwaz, but they could produce nothing worth calculating upon. ’Arab encampments during the winter might, if met with, produce some cattle and sheep. Water .—Water is obtainable from the Karun river only and conveyed direct to this point by boats from the transports which would have to be left at Muhammareh. Stages .—There is nothing to require the stages being of any particular length or terminating at any particular spots. For purposes of water and fuel some point on the river bank would have to be selected, but it is quite immaterial which. Between • All bin Husain and Kut ’ Abdullah the track followed runs for 32 miles over waterless country ; this could, of course, be avoided by following the river more closely, thus lengthening the journey by 12 to 15 miles. Grazing .—There is no grazing except after rain, and then only in very limited quan tity. Fuel .—Fuel is obtainable from brushwood which grows along the bank of the river, but the supply is rapidly diminishing. Transport .—The route in dry weather would be suitable for transport of any descrip tion : after rain wheeled transport would find difficulty, and could probably not count on doing more than 8 to 10 miles a day. After rain, transport of all kinds, and men or horses, would find it difficult to do more than short marches. Physical obstacles .—The only physical obstacle is the passage of the Marid, some 12 miles from Muhammareh. When the water is low {i.e., between May and October) this stream is fordable, though the bottom is always muddy. After the rains have begun {i.e., any time between November and March) this river is often unfordable, and must then be crossed by a ferry, the animals being swum over. The best place for the erection of a bridge, or for the passage by ferry, is within a couple of hundred yards of where it takes off from the Karun; further down the stream gradually develops into a marsh, and a secondary obstacle in the shape of the Fallahieh Canal would have to be crossed. The width of the Marid channel averages about 40 feet at the point where the crossing is recommended. If troops were to be sent from Muhammareh to Ahwaz by the left bank of the Karun, it would be preferable that they should be camped north of the Marid channel. &lt;x&gt; m $ cn o d Names of stages. Distances. Inter mediate. 1 Total. i Mabid 7 7 The route starts on the left bank of the Karun immediately above the point where the Bahmanshlr takes off. The latter is unfordable at all times of the year; travel lers usually cross to or from the right bank of the Karun at Marid, and begin, or con clude, their use of this route at that point. The country traversed is open, uncultivated ground offering very good grazing is dry weather; in rain it is probably very heavy.88 Route No. 32—concld. At 7 miles the Marid has to be crossed. When the river is high this is a broad and difficult obstacle, and passable only by ferry ; in dry weather it is fordable, the best point of passage being within 200 yards of the Karun. There is an old native boat at the village of Marid available as a ferry; it can take ten passengers at a time, but horses have to smim over. Vehicles cannot pass. The width of the channel is 40 feet, but the amount filled with water may be less or more, according to the season of the year. In the beginning of November 1906 it was fordable, the water mounting as far as a pony’s shoulder. Three solitary palm trees standing on the banks of the Karun mark the spot known as ’Ali-ibn-al Husain, which is the usual halting place. Beyond the three palm trees there is nothing to distinguish this point from any other, since there is no habi tation of any sort. ’Al!-ibn-al- 15 22 Husaih Kut ’Abdullah 34 56 From ’Ali-ibn-al Husain two routes can be' followed: one along the river bank to Ahwaz, and the other in a direct north easterly direction across the desert, strik ing the river again at Kut ’Abdullah. This route would be impracticable unless the troops should complete the march of 32 miles, away from the river, in one stage, as there is no water anywhere en ro^e. The country is still barren and open, but after a little rain it first becomes slippery and then heavy and difficult. Kut ’Abdullah is reached at 34 miles. 4 I Ahwaz 6 62 From Kut’Abdullah the route follows the river bank closely as far as Ahwaz, passing two small villages and the town of Nasiri, the recently established suburb of Ahwaz. Route No. 33. BulfarIs to Sultanabad. Epitome. General .—A cross route of little importance connecting Bulfaris with Ramuz and Sultanabad. Obstacles .—The Ab-i-Bulfaris as far as Pijan runs swiftly between banks over grown with reed 15 to 18 feet high and almost impenetrable. The river is fordable, but always with difficulty, and only here and there, as the bed is deep and the current swift, though the volume of water may not be large.

Notes.—(1) For information regarding Ahwaz, Ramuz, Shushtar, Dizfftl and places beyond the limits of the Bakhtiari Garmsir, see the Persian Gulf Gazetteer (Foreign Department, 1909), and Military Report on S. W. Persia, Part II, ’Arabiotan. (2) Only information which could not conveniently be incorporated in route reports, or in Appendix I, has been inserted here. For all details regarding villages and districts, see Appendix I, index and map. (3) Latitude and Longitude of places approximate only and not from actual observations. AHWAZ —Lat. 31° 20'. Long. 48° 48'. Elev. 220'. For other than the following purely military details, and for all informa tion regarding supplies, etc., see Persian Gulf Gazetteer. Mahelas and other native craft can be moved close to the bank and unload ed by a short plank. The steam boats on the river, if moored at the cus toms wharf, can usually approach within 6' of the bar k, but if at Lynch Bros’, wharf a plank, some 20' long, has to be used. Their planks are always available. If horses are to be unloaded off the boat, the custcms wharf is preferable. The tramway has 6 trucks which carry about 1 ton a journey ; under its present organization it can carry about 25 tons per diem from Nasiri to Ahwaz and the same amount from Ahwaz to Nasirl on the return journey, though in practice this is not done. There is no double line anywhere, and in consequence the six trucks must all move simultaneously in the same direction. Camping grounds unlimited in all directions. No shade. Water from river only should be taken, for preference from above Ahwaz village. The town is occasionally decimated by cholera, etc., but is not in the usual94 filthy condition corrmon to Eastern towns. For remarks on supplies, see Parts I and II. The Telegraph Office is situated in the official residence of the Shaikh, opposite the British Consulate. Messrs. Lynch Bros, own a baling press, used for cotton, which could probably be used for pressing bhusa if required. It must be borne in mind that the inhabited area, known indifferently as Ahwaz or as Bandar Nasiri by the outside world, consists of two distinct and separate parts—Ahwaz, an ordinary ’Arab village, which exhibits no tendency towards expan sion, and Bandar Nasiri (Arabic Nasirieh), a town of recent growth of con siderable size, consisting in 1908 of 250 to 300 houses, many of them well built. Opposite is Bandar Aminieh, a village of no importance. VAQiLl—L at. 32° 10'. Long. 48° 55'. Kiev. 800'. An alluvial plain north of Shushtar, drained and irrigated by the Karun River. The most thickly populated district in the Bakhtiari Garmsir, con trolled by the Bakhtiari Khans, who pay taxes on account of it to the Governor of ’Arabistan, who resides usually at Shushtar—see Persian Gulf Gazetteer and Index. Access to the ’Aqili Plain from Shushtar can only be obtained via the Tang-i-’Aqill, a difficult and narrow, gorge, through which the Karun runs, or by crossing the river at Shushtar and again at Jalakan. A few men could hold the Pass against a thousand. Numerous ruins, perched on mounds, dot the ’Aqili plain—see also Layard. B ARD-I-NLSHANDEH— Lat. 32° 5'. Long. 49° 25'. Elev. 2,700'. A ruin 8 miles north-north-east of Maidan Minaftun on Route No. 16 to Gudar-i-Landar. It consists of a long pillar projecting about 12' from the ground, about 1' square, near the remains of a building not unlike Masjid-i-Sulaiman and similarly orientated, but smaller and in worse repair. BARD-I-QAMCHI— Lat. 32° 12'. Long. 49° 40'. Elev. 1,550'. A small district in the Karun Valley, mainly in the hands of the Qmd’ali section of the Haft Lang Bakhtiari. One water-mill close to the river in Darreh Qileh (q.v.). There is a good and regularly used ferry here, with one raft of inflated skins always available for use. Roads lead from the north bank to Kaleh Zaras, Andakeh, and Kaleh Bazuft from the south bank to Malamir and Marghab. (See Nos. 22 and 23.) The river at this point cuts through the Takht-i-Qawashk or Kuh-i-Kamarao by a tang from 30 to 40 yards broad, the cliffs on either side rising 1,000' sheer up. There is no road through the tang, but a well-used track ascends a spur south of the tang, from the summit of which (2,700') a magnificent view of the gorge and the river is obtained. The latter flows at the bottom of a ‘ cirque’ of cliffs rising vertically upwards of 1,500' from the bed of the river. At the southern mouth of the tang are the remains of a bridge, • probably of a single span, or perhaps a suspension bridge. Only the remains of the piers on either side now remain, and that on the west bank ha? almost disappeared: the pier on the east bank is difficult of access, butis in excellent preservation: it is made of cut stone, joined by remarkably tenacious mortar, typical of Sassanian architecture. Little now remains of the causeway, which once led from the main track to the bridge head on either side: this causeway is nearly 50' above the level of low river, as a rise of 40' is not uncommon at this point, where the rocks on either side are precipitous, and the tang only about 35 yards broad. A curious, feature of the tang is a fresh water spring, visible from the rocks 303' above the pier: it enters the river behind a rook 50 yards from the mouth of the tang on the nor.h bank, aud its clear waters contrast strangely with the muddy stream of the Karun. The Bakhtiari explain the broken bridge by the following tale:—A man loved another man’s wife, and when he was discovered, he fled with the lady across the bridge, and then broke the bridge : the river was then in flood and they could not follow him, so he escaped in safety from the punishment for his illicit love. DALUN-Lat. 31° 19'. Long. 50° 4'. Elev. 2,000'. An important village, the head-quar ers of the district of the same name, on the east border of the Bakhtiari Garmsir. East of D ilun, the country is in the hands of the Bahmai orKuhgalu. For details see Appmdix I. The plain which stretches almost unbroken from Maidaud to Patek is very fertile, and is drained by the Ab-i-A’ala and Putu. It is entirely in the hands of the Chohar Lang Bakhtiari. DARREH QlLEH— Lat. 32° 8'. Long. 49° 42'. Elev. 1,600'. A valley near Bard-i-Qamchi {q.v.) noted for its oil springs, which produce the pitch whence the valley takes its name. It is travers ed by Route No. 23 {q.v.) and a small area is occupied with rice-fields on either side of the stream which runs down the valley to join the Karun. The oil springs appear to be the property of the Bakhtiari Khans, but are in the hands of the Q rnd’ali section, who burn the oil in order to obtain the pitch. The valley must once have supported a con siderable peimanent population, for the hillside is elaborately terraced, and the ruins of well-built stone houses cover several spurs. The contmu- ation of the valley to the east is known as Darreh Shami: this portion is inhabited by the Bowalri Haft Lang, and is, like Bard-i-Qamchi, almost deserted in the hot weather. DARWAZEH-I-GACH— Lat. 31° 27'. Long. 50° 2'. Elev. 3,000'. A ruin, about half a mile west of Route No. 19, and a few miles north of Maidaud. It consists of a central archway, 15' broad, 16 yards long, and about 9' high, with a domed roof of the same length on either side. It is said to be an ancient Sassanian toll-gate, and on the whole this seems probable, though it is in a very isolated position, f away from water. Just below it to the north are the foundations of a small serai, and to the south, leading up to it, the remains of a long disused zigzag track can just be discerned. The remarkable feature of the building is that it is made entirely of gach, both the mortar and masonry being of this material96 In view of the friable nature of gypsum stone, it ia astonishing that *- the building should have stood so well and so long. See also De Bode, i, 390, whose illustration is grossly exaggerated. DZARREH— Lat. 39° 2S'. Long. 49° 50'. A point at which the Rud-i-Zard flows in a narrow gorge some 50' deep and in places only G broad at the top, as the rocks overhang in a striking manner. It is notable for the remains of a dam or barrage, probably dating from Sassanian times, and now broken. The dam is about 40' high, 13' w de at the top, splaying to about 18' at water level. One half of the dan has been carried away, but the east ern half still exists and is in fairly good repair. The dam was no doubt utilized to raise the water of the river into an irrigation channel, the remains of which can still be traced for some distance along the precipitous face of the gorge. KALEH GAZHDIAAK— Lat. 31° 55'. Long. 49° 57'. Elev. 3,600'. A ruined fort on the top of a rocky limistone promontory bordering on the north edge of Malamlr lake. The name moans “scorpion fort.” The south face is too steep to climb, and the lake occasionally rises so high as to make it almost inaccessible. When the fort was built, the water level was no doubt higher than it is at pre sent, for old markings of the lake are visible 10' above the present lake level on the face of the rock. A zigzag path of unhewn stone, in fair pre servation, leads to the top of the ridge, on which a series of buildings must have stood. Several underground rooms, 6' broad, 6' high, and 10' to 30' long, still exist, the roofs being in sound condition. There is one cis tern, and in the wall of a house near by is a red clay drain-pipe, which ap parently brought the water from the roof of a house into the cistern. The fort is said to possess magic qualities. Stones from the locality are in occasional request to be carved into the quaint stone lions which decorate the graves of eminent Lurs. The fort bears 350° from Malamir 4 v village. KALEH TOE— Lat. 31° 38'. Long. 49° 59' Elev. 3,400'. A large village with a fort standing on a mound in the centre of the Kaleh Tul plain. For details of the village see App. III. The fort is 50 yards long by 20 yards broad, rectangular, with 6 bastions, one main entrance being at the south end ; another main entrance also exists at the north end. The mound is about 50' high, and the walls of the fort are about 15' from the top of the mound. The lower part of the walls is of gach and stone, but when rebuilt about 20 years ago, brick was used instead. The towers are cracked. A well about 60' deep inside the fort supplies the occupants with all the water they require. Khuda Karam Khan, the present owner and occupier of the fort, stated that when digging the well, ruins of successive buildings and pottery, etc., were found to a depth of 45' or 50' below the present summit of the mound.' See Layard and De Bode. The name means “The fort of the mound.” In its present form it is only about 60 years old. KARON river— Rising in the snow-clad mountains of the Zagros, the Karun flows swift ly to the sea by a very circuitous route. Its first appearance in the Bakhtiari Garmsir is at Pul-i-Shalu, where it is bridged by a suspen sion bridge, erected in 1902 by Messrs. Lynch Bros, on behalf of the Bakhtiari Khans: it flows here in a deep ravine with steep sides ; it is unfordable, and subject to sudden and violent floods. Thence to Susan it flows north-west, in a deep rocky ravine, but at Susan it passes through a small plain, and there is an easy road to the river from either side. At this point a road from Malamir crosses the river. Thence to Bard- i-Qamchi {q.v.) the river flows in a deep gorge, generally quite inaccessible; indeed a caravan could only move from the east bank of the river to Bard- i-Qamchi (in that crossing the Kariln) by. a circuitous march of two days’ duration. From Susan to Bard-i-Qamchi, on the west bank there is a lairly direct mule track. At Bard-i-Qamchi is a well known and regularly used ford, just below the gorge of that name (see Bard-i-Qamchi, Part IV). After 3 miles between low hills, the Karun receives tributaries from either side (An- dakeh and Marghab) near the seldom used ford of Qamchi or Hazardappan. It then re-enters the hills, passing through an impassable inaccessible gorge, the cliffs on either side rising sheer 1,000'or more almost from the water’s edge. In this gorge, close to Pa-i-Pul-i-Landar is a place known as Ji-Ji, where the river at low water (in autumn) can be crossed dry foot, s according to native report, by an active goat, and where men are hauled across by rope and pulley. This is possible on account of great boulders in mid-stream. The river here has a flow of 8 to 10 miles pei hour for a distance of over a mile, and the rapids thus formed are one of the finest pieces of scenery in the district. At Pa-i-Pul-i-Landar ! the river, which has been flowing south-west, turns north-west again. 'It receives near the point where it turns north-west the Ab-i-Kaleh Zaras, a large stream which falls steeply into the main stream through the Tang-i-Dulau, dropping about 400 / in 4,000 yards. This Tang-i-Dulau is the only means of access to the Karfln from the north bank between Bard-i-Qamchi and Gudar-i-Landar. The Ab-i-Sarileh also joins on the south bank. From Pa-i-Pul-i-Landar, the ravine in which the river flows is passable on either side for foot pas sengers, but caravans must keep some miles from the river on the hills to the south, or, if on the north bank, at the foot of the north slopes of Kuh-i-Landar, whose south face is an impassable cliff. These features predominate as far as Cham-i-Nuqreh ; several considerable streams join the river from the north, but no streams worth mentioning join from the gach hills which lie to the south, whose waters drain almost entirely South to the Ab-i-Batwand. From Cham-i-Nuqreh to Gotwand the river runs in a narrow valley bounded on both sides by impassable cliffs. On the south bank there is no practicable road, but on the north bank a regularly used caravan route runs along the river bank, emerging a few miles 67 I. B. N98 north of Gotwand. The river now winds gently across the fertile ’Aqlll plain till, passing through the difficult Tang-i-’Aqlli, it reaches Shushtar, and splits up into its distributaries, the Gargar and Shatait, only to reunite again at Band-i-QIr. It joins the Shatt-al-’Arab at Muhammareh. MAID AN MINAFTUN— Lat. 31° 58'. Long. 49° 18'. Elev. 1,100'. A plain 15 miles east of Batwand, in the Masjid-i-Sulaiman district, without any permanent inhabitants, and with no drinking water nearer than Ab-i-Garmak. It is the scene of borings for oil, undertaken in 1907 by the Concessions Syndicate, Ltd. Oil was struck in large quantities in May 1908, and developments are proceeding, including the construction of a pipe line to convey the oil to a point on the Shatt-al-’Arab. A road (see No. 21) was made in 1906-07 from Ahwaz and from Darreh Khazineh on the Gargar in order to bring up the heavy plant. From January to 1908, a force of 8 sowars and 12 sepoys, under the command of two British officers, was stationed at the spot in order to ensure that no interference with the working of the business should be caused by the truculence of the local Lurs, who had previously aroused some concern by their minatory atti tude. MAlAMIR— Lat. 31° 43'. Long. 49° 58'. Elev. 3,000'. A village of some 130 huts, in two sections, on a fresh water stream flow ing imothe lake. It is the sixth stage on the Ahwaz-Isfahan Road (see No. 1, Part III). The inhabitants of the village are Ahl-i-MuhammadI Haft Lang. The name Malamir is also given to the whole plain, in which the village stands.^ This plain,_ the centre of which is occupied by a lake, the Shatt-i- Malamir, is extensively cultivated, and though not irrigated to any extent, produces large quantities of wheat and barley, which find a market in Ramuz and Shushtar. In a good year, there are probably no less than 20,000 acres under cultivation in the plain. The plain affords excellent and unlimited grazing. The lake is shallow, and varies in size greatly according to the season of the year. It abounds with duck and water- fowl. The old name of Jffie plain is Idij or Izij, and it is known to have been the seat of the Atabeg kings. Sassanian sculptures are found on the edges of the plain in the hills : (see Shikaft-i-Salman and Kul-i-Farah); see also Kaleh Gazhdimak, above, and Layard. The plain is inhabited by various sub-sections of the Dinarun! Haft Lang including the Nauruzi, Bowairi Sarquli, and Ahl-i-Muhammadi (pro nounced Auli Mamadi); all these tribes go to the ‘*yailaq 5 for the hot weather leaving only a few families to look after the crops, etc. MAMATAIN— Lat. 31° 19'. Long. 49° 50'. Elev. 1,200'. A village of about 30 huts on the north bank of Putang or Putii river 12 miles east-north-east of Ramuz. It is owned by the Sarum-ul-Mulk. It has lately come into prominence from the sinking there of experimental borings for oil by the Concessions Syndicate, Ltd. They were led to start operations at this place by the existence of sulphur springs, and a considerable “sur face show” of oil, which taints the waters of the river at this spot. One99 mg , -«4\ s boring was made at Shardin, and a second boring at a spot opposite the village on the south bank of the stream : the borings were sunk to a depth of about 2,500, but with absolutely no result. The plant, workshops, and houses erected were of the same kind and on the same scale as those erected at Maidan Minaftun {q.v.). A cart-road was made to Mamatain from Shikarch and Ahwaz : it was originally intended to cut through the gach hills on the west side of the Ramuz river near its entrance to the ’Arabistan plain : a road 10' broad was actually constructed on this align ment at great expense in 1906-07, but when it had been completed it was found impossible to take carts through it, and the old alignment along the Ramuz river, crossing it once, and shortly after recrossing and joining the original alignment at Cham Lashun was finally adopted. MANGASHT— The name given to a lofty mass of mountains extending from the east of the Malamir plain to the valley of the Ab-i-A’ala, and bounded on the east by the Karun and on the west by the Malamir-Bagh Malik road. There are three main peaks, the highest being east of Bagh Malik, and probably about 11,500'high, the lowest, east of Malamir, is 9,600'in height (Malamir 3,000'). Snow is usually found in the rifts on the summits of all these heights till the end of July, but in the abnormal summer of 1908 the last mentioned peak was without snow at the beginning of July, though the two others had a plentiful supply of snow. The range is very deficient in streams or springs, although composed entirely of limestone. Springs, however, exist at Shaikhun, on the east slopes of the mountain at its north end, at Ab-i- Harmun, on the west of slopes in a similar position, and the village of Bula- was, above the Bagh Malik valley, is plentifully watered all the year round and possesses numerous fruit gardens. At a time when the maximum daily shade temperature of Maidan Minaftun was 116°, that at Ab-i-Harmun was 82°, that at the summit 75°. Ab-i-Harmun is 6,000' above sea level, and a pleasant spot for a camp. The spring is usually plentiful, but in 1908 produced only 3 gallons an hour, enough, however, for a small camp, as transport animals could be kept at the bottom of the hill at the spring of Kaleh-i-Nai, known as ‘ c tambaku kali ’ ’ owing to a small tobacco plantation at the spring. The following route is the only track from Malamir up the peak referred to above as the lowest of the three :— Ab-i-Harmun .. 14 14 General direction south-east. Leav ing Malamir strike across the plain towards a long rocky spur which juts out into the plain to the east, and follow it, keeping between it and the. marsh of Bundun at the end of the Malamir plain. The camps on the borders of these marshes are the best places whence to procure a guide. At 2 miles cross the Ahwaz-Isfahan track. At 6 miles reach the bottom of a tang, whence Malamir bears about 310°. Ascending this pass over a low kutal on which is a ruined fort, known as Kaleh-i-Nai. At 8 miles reach a small spring, good all the year round, and flowing with a minimum of some 10 gallons per minute. N 2100 4 i Continuing, descend into the dry bed of a nullah which drains the west slopes of the Mangasht into the marshes, and commence the ascent of the hill. The path is stony and difficult, but practicable for lightly laden animals. The slopes of the hill are well wooded ‘ ‘ with belut ’ ’ trees. At 14 miles reach the Ab-i-Harmun, a small spring hidden in a ravine near a small clearing, whence Malamir is visible. Supplies nil. Water from spring. Fuel plentiful. The summit is reached by a similar track, steep, but offering no special difficulties for mules. A small clearing just below the summit makes a good spot for a camp. A track leads from the summit south to the higher peaks. MANJANlK— Lat 31° 32'. Long. 50° O' Elev. 2,700 / . See Layard and De Bode. A large ruined village, with the remains of a mosque, and of a large and apparently superfluous bridge across the Bula- was river. It probably dates from Sassanian times. MASJID-I-SULAIMAN —Lat. 32° O'. Long. 49°. 18/ Elev. 1,300'. ^ A ruin well known by all Lurs in the district, near the hamlet of Ab-i- Garmak, and about 12 miles east-north-east of Batwand. It can be distin guished from a distance by a large hundr tree growing on the site. The ruin consists oi a rectangular oblong platform on one side of a spur of the rock surrounded by higher hills, and in its immediate vicinity by ruined houses. Flights of steps lead up to the platform on two sides: on the third side is a rectangular projection from the main line of the platform, facing west. The retaining walls are made of large irregular blocks, roughly dressed on one side, and erected apparently without the use of mortar, (see Bard- i-Nishandeh above). See Layard, 1,260. The same name is also usually applied to the whole surrounding district which includes Maidan Minaftun (q.v.), where the Concessions Syndicate, Ltd., are boring for oil. MUNGANUN— Lat. 31° 28'. Long. 50° 3'. Elev. 2,800 / . A district south-east of Bagh Malik, occupied by the Mombaini Chehar Lang. It is bounded by the Mangasht mountains, the Rud-i-Zard and the Ab-i-A’ala. The valley is hilly, but fertile, well-watered and well-irrigated. Almost every hamlet has a number of irrigated fields, and rice is largely grown. There is no doubt that a population far greater than that now living in the district could be supported, if full use were made of the many natural advantages which the valley possesses : there is fertile land in abundance, and a perennial flow of water from the Mangasht, as well as from the Ab-i-A’ala. The upper part of the valley, which is inhabited by Bahmai, is covered with oak trees {lelut) often of great age and considerable size. The acorns are largely consumed by the Bahmai. They are ground to powder, and the flour thus made is steeped in water to remove the bitter juices. It is then dried and made into bread in the usual way. Belut flour is of a brown colour, somewhat resembling tobacco. See Kaleh Mangasht.SHIKAFT-I-SALMAN— Lat. 31° 43'. Long. 49° 58'. Elev. 3,460'. A ravine and cave miles south-west of Malamir at the foot of the hills bounding the Malamir plain to the south. On either side of the stream (dry in summer) which flows down the ravine are ruined houses, apparent ly of the Sassanian period. The spot is famous for the sculptures and inscription at the mouth of, and within, the cave. For a detailed description of these, see Layard and De Bode, but the latter cannot be relied on. The inscription has been published, with a translation, by the trustees of the British Museum. SHESHTAK— Lat. 32° 3'. Long. 48° 63'. Elev. 410'. For general information and supplies, population, etc., see Persian Gulf Gazetteer. It appears that a thousand men and transport could be supplied with food and provisions by the town without appreciable inconvenience. The town is a great centre for charvadars, more so than Ahwaz, for whereas, grain and fodder being expensive, muleteers do not remain in Ahwaz for more than a few days, they have their head quarters at Shushtar, or at Ramuz. It is probable that at least as many mules work between Shushtar and Isfahan as between Ahwaz and Isfahan. The town is filthy and should be rigorously avoided by troops ; it is frequently visited by cholera, though in comparison to other towns the visitations are said to be light. Camping grounds can be obtained on either side of the road, but good camping grounds near the town itself cannot be obtained. SUSAN— A scattered village and district with about 150 families in summer, and 600 in winter. It is situated on both banks of the Ear uniat a point a mile east of the gorge which the river enters previous to turning south towards Bard-i- Qamchi. On all sides of the small plain on which the village stands steep hills rise to a height of 3,000' or more, whence several large perma nent springs issue. 800 to 1,000 acres of rice cultivation, and double that area of unirrigated crops make Sfisan a supply centre of some importance in a peculiarly barren district. The villages of Chlla, distant 3 farsakhs, and Iva, 6 farsakhs, both on the Karun River, would probably provide supplies equal, in each case, to half the quantities available in Susan. Roads lead from Susan north to Kaleh Bazuft, either from the old bridge head (known as the Ab-Bid track), or from the portion of the village on the north bank of the Karun. These roads are both steep and difficult. Roads also lead from Susan west across Kuh-i-Chila to Chila (3 farsakhs) and to Iva (6 farsakhs). For roads to Susan from the Malamir plain see’Nos. 30 and 31. There is a ferry always available, and largely used by Iliats in their annual migrations, especially by those inhabiting the Malamir plain The tang through which the Karun runs lies west of Susan, and is passable [ on either bank. In the middle of this tang, nearly^ miles from the Imam- zadeh, stands the ruin of an ancient bridge. The main pillars, about 15' square and 15' high are in good preservation, although annually submerged to a depth of some 10 to 20 feet by the floods which follow the melting102 of the snows or heavy rain. The abnormal floods of March 1908 raised the river level no less than 60' above the normal summer level in this tang. The bridge consisted of a central span of about 45' on pillars some 55' above low water, and approachable dry shod in . summer time ; be tween these and the bank stood smaller pillars, making 2 subsidiary spans of about 10' each. The total length of the bridge would thus be about 85 feet. The road through the tang shows numerous traces of ancient con struction. There is a famous Imamzadeh on the north side of the Karun, near the village locally known as “ dunyal * The Imamzadeh of Sultan Ibrahim near Iva on the opposite side of the river is one of the best known Imamzadehs in the district.APPENDICES.APPENDICES (1) Abstract of supplies available in each division of the district.

Statement showing carrying capacity of steamers plying on the Kdrun. (1) The Malamir (Euphrates and Tigris S. N. Company) built in 1892 : a paddle boat: 160' long, 27' broad : cargo capacity on a 2' 9' draught (without barges) 23 tons : on a 3' 8' draught (maximum) 60 tons. Can tow 2 barges alongside, holding 50 to 70 tons cargo each. Amount of cargo carried varies with the depth of water in the river, which is often low until January, and can only be relied on to be good between Feb ruary and June ? Can carry 300 passengers on board on a 2' 9' draught, up to 600 on a 3' 6' draught: (but in this case no cargo on board the boat). Average time taken from Muhammareh to Nasiri 36 hours : vice versa 10 hours; averages 5 knots up stream, and up to 14 knots down stream. Has two decks : and cabin accommodation for 6—1st class passengers. Receives a subsidy of £2,000 per annum from the British Government, but this is only guaranteed until 1910. Its profitable running depends mainly on the wheat traffic; but for the subsidy it is stated that the running of the boat would entail a loss to the company, and would be discontinued. The Captain and Engineer are Englishmen and the boat is registered at Lloyds. The boat ties up at night, and only steams by day. The Nusrat (Mu’in-ut-Tujjar, living at Tehran) put together in 1906, 122' long, 20' wide (including sponson) a stern-wheel paddle boat: cargo capa city without barge from 25 to 40 tons according to draught: can tow 2 barges alongside, each holding 50 tons. Average time from Muhammareh to Nasiri 28 hours, vice versa 14 hours, has 2 decks, and poor accommodation for 4-lst class passengers. The Captain is an ’Arab. The Shaikh of Muhammareh owns 2 boats the Iran and Karun somewhat similar to the Nusrat, but in bad repair and not likely to be available for military purposes. Iran and Karun draw 3' 6'. He also has two small steam launches the Nasiri and Muzaffer, but these would be of little use for military purposes. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Muhammareh also has a small steam launch which can make about 3| knots against stream up the Karun, and draws 3' 6' / . The Customs Service have a steamer Azarbaijan, locally known as No. 2&gt; built for the Persian Government in the Government dock yard at Bombay, steams about 10 miles an hour, drught 6' to 6' 6.' In addition to the Malamir, the following three boats, owned by the Euphrates &amp; Tigris S. N. Company, and plying between Basrah and Baghdad, could probably be used on the Karun. Their names are the Khalifa, Mejidieh and the Blosse Lynch. For details see page 96, Military Report on Eastern Turkey in Asia. 67 I. B. Q' 122 The only steamboats working between Ahwaz and Shalili are— (1) Shushan (owned by the Persian Government) built in 1888 : 116' long : draught 21' to 3': stern-wheeler. Cargo capacity 20 to 50 tons, according to the depth of water in the river. 100 to 200 passengers. Worked by Messrs. Lynch Bros, for the Persian Government, as the navigation of the river above Ahwaz is restricted to Persian-owned vessels. (2) M’awin (owned together with two 40-ton barges, by the Mu’in-ut- Tujjar), built in 1907, started May 1908, 80' long, 19' broad (including sponsons): draught 21' to 3', worked by twin screws. Cargo capacity about 20 to 40 tons. 100 passengers: tows one 40-ton barge. (The other barge remaining at Ahwaz meanwhile to be loaded.) { r123 APPENDIX IV. REPORT ON THE TRAMWAY AT NASIRl. The tramway consists of a single line. It is of 3' gauge. Length 2,500 yards. It leaves the river bank at the custom-house yard a short distance from where goods are landed by the Persian boat, Nusrat, and terminates at the point on the river above Ahwaz whence navigation by the Shushan commences. Goods landed at Messrs. Lynch’s yard have to be conveyed a distance of 400 to 500 yards to the point where they can be loaded into the trolleys. At the present time a mule trolley drawn by a single mule is used to cover this distance, but an arrangement has been made for the establishment of a branch line leading directly into Messrs. Lynch’s yard. The line is level throughout and passes first through a small cutting at places 3' deep and then over a brick-built causeway. Six trolleys are at present (1909) in use. Each trolley is drawn by a single horse and can carry about one ton. The trolleys consist of open platforms 6' 8'—4' 9 ,&gt; , and stand about 2' above the level of the rails. The rails, which are very old, and generally laid with heads touching, occasionally buckle up from expansion during the hot weather. The tramway is the property of Mu’in-ut-Tujjar, a Persian merchant ; all goods proceeding up or down stream by steam-boat transport a,re compelled by terms of the original concession to be carried between the points of navi - gation by this line. The exorbitant charge of 3 krans per ton is made for their transport. In connection with the above it may be noted that the same merchant obtained a concession for a similar tramway connecting Shalili, the terminus of steam navigation on the Ab-i-Gargar north of Ahwaz, with Shushtar, a distance of about 7 miles, but has decided not to venture upon its construc tion. The Mu’in erected a shed at Shalili in 1906 but floods in the spring of 1908 ruined it and it has not since been used. Messrs. Lynch Bros, also pro pose to erect a shed there. The Shaikh of Muhammareh has proposed to run a rival tramway line parallel to the present line, with Messrs. Lynch Bros ’ financial assistance.127 APPENDIX VI. Weights and measures in common use in the Bahhtidri Garmsir, Shushtar and Ahwdz. Length .— £ Zar ’ (Arabic Dr’a) = about 40 inches : this measure is in use in commerce and for all purposes. I Distance .—The ‘ farsakh ’ is a vague term denoting anything from 3 to 4 miles. It is properly speaking equivalent to the distance that a ridden mule traverses at a walk in an hour, and may be taken as about 3 miles. Arabs, however, are not accustomed to reckoning in this way, and can only say that,“ you will reach the place by midday ”, or “ in the afternoon ”, or ‘ ‘ by sunset ’ ’. Lurs are almost as vague, and it is not safe to rely on their estimates of distance. Weight .—Every town has its own standard, and different standards are in force for different articles. The following are the standards most commonly met with in the district:— Man-i-Shushtar Huga (Huqa) (anglice ohe) Man-i-Ism’aili ^ Hawizeh Kharwar Taghar(Arab) 15| lbs. (approximate). 2‘8 lbs. (800 to ton). 36 or 40 ohes. The number must be fixed used for grain in bulk = 650 lbs. beforehand. Man-i*Ramuz = 109 lbs. Man-i-Shah (used on the Bakhtiari road) = 13 lbs. Man-i-Tabriz (batman of Customs) = 6 - 5 lbs. Sang-i-Kuhneh (Bakhtiari) = 12 lbs. Coinage .— 50 dinars (not coined) ; ' = 1 shahi. 2 shahia *= 1 qamari. 20 shahia = 1 kran. 10 krans ■=&gt; 1 tftman. The following coins are current (copper) || shahi approximate. (nickel) I shahi. N .5.—Nickel coins are called 1 Not accepted by Bakh- Warsho ” (or “ Belgiki ”) J tiari. (silver) 1 kran minted (“ charq”) value. (known as “ hazar ” or “real”) at face128 1 kran (old sort hand struck : about 11 to the tttman). 2 krans, minted coins called “ kran charkhl.” 5 „ (seldom seen). Liquids are sold by the bottles, or by weight. Meat is sold by weight. In 1908 the price of beef was 8 krans fo i 15 lbs. Bread is sold by weight, or in small quantities, by the “ dasteh ” : this being the numerical adjective applied to the thin flat cakes of bread which form the staple diet of the population of the district. In 1908 the price of bread made from wheat flour (not barley) was from 10 to 14 “ dasteh ’ ’ to the kran. [ For further information see Persian Gulf Gazetteer (F. D.). X ) t129 APPENDIX VII. Operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd. 31 This brief note is not intended to do more than state the actual state of development reached in September 1909, at the time of going to press, and to indicate the probable direction that developments will take in the imme diate future. Q f # In May 1908 oil was struck at Maidan Minaftfln at a depth of 1 200^ in No. 1 well and an uncontrollable flow of about 3,000 gallons per diem obtained. r Subsequently traces of oil, sufficient to justify cessation of boring pend ing the arrival of pumps and the establishment of a pipe-line, were found in No. 2 well at 1,200', in No. 3 at 450', in No. 4 at 1,000', in No. 5 at 900' and finally oil was struck unexpectedly in No. 6 at 700' and an uncontrollable flow of perhaps 4,000 gallons per day encountered. No. 7 and No 8 holes are now being bored. The “ proved ” area, where borings have de monstrated the existence of oil in large quantities, now extends along a line 2| miles long and may reasonably be expected to extend much further in every divertion. The oil is of high quality, containing a considerable portion of volatile oil, accompanied by gas under great pressure, which causes persons inhaling it to become insensible almost immediately. The propor tion of volatile oil is such as to make it impracticable to use the crude oil for marine fuel until it has been submitted to a preliminary process of retire ment, to remove the volatile oil, and this process is also essential before the crude oil could be shipped in bulk on board a steamer for export. Work at Mamatain has been stopped pro tem., and it is doubtful whether \ I™er borings will meet with any greater success than those originally made which were carried down to a depth of over 2,000' with absolutely no result. Expert opinion is divided on the point. The prospects of successful boring at white oil springs are considered by geological experts to be good, and it is not improbable that action will be taken in this direction before long. To transport oil to the Persian Gulf, or rather to the Persian bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab, where a refinery will be set up (at Braim on ’Abbadan Island) a pipe-line will run from Maidan Minaftun to Ahwaz, and thence to Abbadan Island. As far as Wais, the pipe will be of 6' diameter, thence to Abbadan, 8 . The total weight of the pipe-line installation is 30,000 tons. A telephone or telegraph line will run along the pipe, for the use of the supervising staff. There will be a pumping station at Maidan Minaftun and another midway, perhaps near white oil springs. The pipe-line is expected to be ready by January 1912, but this optimistic estimate of the company’s representative must be received with caution. J As far as can be seen, the company have a large quantity of oil “ in sight ” be^d ^ aS oil ' gettin S attheir P resent works is concerned, Httle anxiety need 67 I. B. R130 4 Difficulties are more likely to arise over the question of finding markets for their products. Conditions of life and wages in ’Arabistan make it diffi cult to produce oil so cheaply as elsewhere, and there is no local market for the almost unexportable oils, such as petrol, etc., which exist in un usually large quantities in the oil now being obtained. On these and kindred points, however, until practical experience is gained, little or nothing can u.ow be usefully said. *INDEX.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100025472967.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/10/1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100025472967.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/10/1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Military Report on S.-W.
