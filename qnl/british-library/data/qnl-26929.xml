It seems to me that so long as the Sultan considered it desirable that a British officer should act as Administrator in Muscat (which might other wise not survive at all) his views should perhaps carry more weight than Mr. Baxter’s. 2. I do not think the ignorance of the Foreign Office regarding this part of the world has ever been more clearly displayed and it is indeed fortunate both for the Gulf States and British interests that they have so little to do with them. 3.

We have not yet studied all the implications of this strange proposal, and it appears unnecessary to examine in detail at this stage a project which, in all probability, will never come to anything. It is clear to us, however, that very careful consideration would have to be given to this proposal before His Majesty’s Government could contemplate the appointment of a British official as the Ruler of an independent Moslem State. The position of such an official would, in our opinion, be completely anomalous and it would be likely to give rise to many difficulties both in Muscat itself and elsewhere. In the circumstances, we hope that you will be able to warn the Government of India and the Political Resident that the proposal is not quite so straight forward and simple as might appear at first sight.

Major Jenabi had two conversations with me in.the coursej of which we talked about Muscat affairs. During the second of these conversations he asked me if I could tell him if it was true that Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal has been forced by the British Government to abdicate in favour of his son the present Sultan. He stated that he had read literature in Iraq to this effect and gave me to understand that this was the general impression throughout Iraq. I explained the true state of affairs to Major Jenabi and took care to make clear to him that far from forcing the ex-Sultan to abdicate His Majesty’s Government had brought such influence as they had to bear in an endeavour to persuade him not to leave his country. Major Jenabi then asked me if it was true that Muscat was a British Protectorate. I explained the political position of Muscat.

In the course of a talk I had with the Sultan just before his departure for 'Dhofar he mentioned to roe that one of the subjects he wished to discuss with you when you visited Muscat in January was that of choosing his successor. As we were aware, the Cultan said, he had no son and perhaps mii.ht never be blessed with one* moreover he added, he was only mortal and God alone knew what the future held in store for him etc. etc. Consequently, His Highness declared, he was anxious that the important matter of the selection of a suitable person to succeed hiro.ae Sultan, in the event of anything happening to him, should be made as soon as possible aiMi he desired, he said, tc discuss this question with you personally. tfhat he was especially anxious to ensure, the Sultan stated, was that whoever v/as chosen as hie successor would actually ascend the throne. Tills His Highness declared he felt, owing to the intriguing character of all the Members of the Hullng ~ ? amily could only be guaranteed if His ?iajesty f e Government would give their support and influence in carrying out his wishes in the matter. I do not think the Sultan is contemplating abdication in the near future though I shall be surprised if he ends- hia days in Muscat. I believe that his father’s example and the latter’s 'life in slippers 4 * which he enjoys with apparently perfect happiness and content in Japan frequently makes a strong appeal to the Sultan. Honourable Lieutenant-'Jolonel Sir Trenchard ?owle, FCJIS., JBri., Political Resident in the Persian (kilf Bushire•I personally feel It would be a very bad day for Muscat if Jaiyld Said abdicated} I can see no one amongst the Ruling Kamily capable of providing a worthy successor. It is only a short time before you are due to visit Iluscat but I am writing now to let you know of the Sultan's ideas so that you may have more time to consider the matter before he discusses it with you himself • Yours sincerely, ed.
