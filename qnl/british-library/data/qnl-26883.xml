As His Majesty’s Government are aware, the subsidy onginat £ 1856 £ an annual payment to be made by the Sultan of Zanzibar andhis successors to his kinsman in Muscat as a compensation for the latter s renunciation of ^ claims to Zanzibar. Later cn for various reasons, to mention but two, to ^ e P Muscat financially solvent; and to secure a revision and later abolition, of the Anti-Slave Trade treaties, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom tooK over this liability.

The Government of India, therefore, feel t*t the responsibility for the payment of the subsidy should ab initio have fallen on His Majesty s Government in United Kingdom. In any case the Government of India are of the view that since the 1st April 1947,.when His Majesty's Government took over control and administration, and thereby the responsibility for the peace and security o these Persian Gulf Stations, there is no longer any justification for making this disbursement from Indian revenues. J. Since the Government of India have agreedby their letter No ‘ dated the 30th April 1947, to maintain during the financial year 1947-48 the staff and services as existing before the transfer, though at the expense of Imperial Revenues, they will continue to disbuse these monthly payments up to September 1948, cat the understanding that His Majesty’s Government will reimburse the Government of India of the sum paid at the rate of Rs. 7,200/- per in nth with retrospective effect from the 1st of April 1947. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Sigied) B. K. Kapur Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.

(iii) High Commissioner for India in London.• s &lt; . i *. Extract of paragraphs 1-4 of Confidential letter No* 70-S of 1932 from the Hcn'ble Lt. Colonel H. V. Biscoe, I.A., Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. British Residency A Consulate-G&lt;5ieral, Bushire, the 12th February 1932. With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. T. 11, dated the 8th January 1932, I have the honour to address the Government of India regarding the subsidies which are at present paid to the Muscat State. • 2. These subsidies are two in number, the 'Zanzibar' subsidy of Rs. 86,400, and the Arms Traffic of Rs. 1,00,000 per annum, and the question of their continuance arises in connection with the abdication of Saiyid Taimur and the accession of his son Saiyid Said. 3. As regards the former subsidy there would seem to be no doubt that it is an . absolute'subsidy, conditional only on the new Ruler promising friendship and the maintenance of his treaty obligations. This subsidy was granted to the Sultan of Muscat under Lord Canning' s sward of 1861, as compensation for the abandonment of his claims over Zanzibar, and was originally payable by the Sultan of Zanzibar. Owing however to constant deisms in payment by the latter ruler responsibility for its payment was assumed in 1873 by the Government of India so long as the Sultan 'continued faithfully to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifest uis friendship towards the British Government', the cost being divided equally between the British end Indian Governments. In Lorimer Volume 1, page 500 it is pointed out that in the discussions which took place in 1868-70 between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India the former impugned and the latter maintained the indefeasible right of the Sultan of 'Oman to a subsidy under the award of 1861, and that no definite conclusion was reached. Ther fore the subsidy, of which payment to Turki began in lB73, “ay be regarded either as a new subsidy or a continuation of that decreed by Lord Canning, but the latter view which was supported by the Government of India, appears to be the juster, and having regard to the origin of the payment would seem to be correct. The subsidy was at thefc time converted into rupees and paid at the rate of Rs. 86,^400 a year. From 1s t September 1883 the date on which His Majesty's Govemment assumed the exclusive direction of Zanzibar affairs the subsidy became an exclusively Indian ' charge . On the accession of Saiyid Faisal payment of the subsidy was continued to him, but owing to his unsatisfactory behaviour was suspended from the beginning of December 1898, but in October 1900 the Government of India eventually decided to liquidate all their claims against the Sultan from the accumulated arrears of the subsidy, and a small balance was paid to the Sultan. 4. On the death of Saiyid Taimur confusion seems to have arism regarding the two subsidies, and they were discussed as though they were on the same basis, which is not the case, and owing to the Zanzibar subsidy being linked with that of the Arms Traffic subsidy the Govemment of India did not treat it as an absolute subsidy, but sanctioned its continuance only on condition that the Sultan agreed to the post ponement of the revision of the Muscat Commercial Treaty - vide Foreign and Political Department telegram No. DS.67 of 20th January 1914, and also DS.76, dated 26th January 1914. In 1921 however, in considering the question of the reduction of the Arms Traffic subsidy, the Political Agent, Muscat, expressed the view that the Zanzibar subsidy was, subject to certain not very clear conditions, the right of any Sultan recognised by the British Govemment - a view which was concurred in by the Resident, vide Bushire letter No. 138-S of 13th June, 1921, and it may be assumed that the Government of India also concurred as they instructed the Resident to explain to the Sultan the terms of both the Zanzibar and the Aims Tralfic subsidy - vide their memorandum No. 1543-E.A. , dated 29th December 1921. Whether any communication was made to the Sultan at the time my records do not show, but presumably some verbal intimation at rate was given to His Highness, since in his letter No. 32-S dated 22nd September, which formed an enclosure to Bushire letter No. 790-S of 22nd October 1922, the Political Agent reported that the Sultajn had discussed with him the nature of the Arms Traffic subsidy. No further reference now ever is made/made i'n any correspondence of the Zanzibar subsidy and I think it will be seen from the above brief summary of the history of this subsidy that the Govemmmt of India have accepted the view that it is an absolute subsidy granted to the Sultan of Muscat subject only to his living in terns of amity and friendship with His Majesty^ Government and fulfilling his treaty engagements*M.L;C./i2.5m./6/47 E C r T' OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR INDIA.

He accompanied the Sultan on his European tour in 1938. In November 1939 tHe Sultan informed the Political Agent that Tarik*s mother haal returned to Turkey-»from where he did not say.

QMAJg AFFAIRS * I have the honour to report that on 19th ultimo Sheikh Mohammad bin Isa bin Salih el Harithi, deputed by his father, paid a visit to Muscat, where he wa s the guest of His Highness the Sultan. 2. The ostensible object of the visit was to settle certain outstanding cases between Muscat and Oman, (including the case of the Sib murder reported in my letter Ho.2iQ dated ‘ 20th December 1932), and to make representations regarding the alleged excessive import duties collected at Sur by the Muscat authorities. 3. Since the Sib murder of 1932 certain other murders have apparently taken place in Oman, the murderers taking refuge in Muscat territory. as the responsible Omani authorities had adopted an evasive and unsatisfactory attitude with regard to the Muscat representations, so the Muscat Government have hitherto declined to take action on Omani claims. The latter being in a preponderance the shoe has now begun to pinch the Omani corn, and hence the present deputation. 4* sheikh Mohamnad presented his cases with consummate and tortuous skill, but the ripostes of His Highness in each case proved too much for him. Having lost the first round, he endeavoured to dig up cases dating back in some instances fifteen years. The Sultan however flatly declined to entertain any such claimsstating tiaat they should have been presented at the time by the responsible Sheikhs, and that the only casetfof which he was prepared to take cognizance were those that had occurred in his own reign* 5* SheiKh Mohammad then referred to the alleged grievan ces of Oioanis arising out of excessive collections at Sur on imported Omani produce* His Highness on examination of his records found that recoveries had in fact been collected in excess of the 5% stipulated in the Treaty* «ftiilst informing sheikh Mohammad w that in view of the fall in prices and out of personal regard for him, he had issued orders fo r a temporary reduction of the amounts to be collected M , His Highness has issued instructions to rectify the mistake* 6. It is somewhat amusing to note that in his letter of greeting to the Sultan, Sheikh Isa stated tna t he was sending his son to deal direct with His Highness on certain matters M a s we do not want any intermediary between us”, (the intermediary being the British)* Inspite of this fact Sheikh Mohammad was also armed with a polite letter from his father to me asking m to arbitrate in any matters that his son might not be able to get settled This letter sheikh Mohammad presented to me when he eventually decided to call at the Agency on his last day in Mu sea t. 7. The main point of interest however would appear to lie in the fact that the Omani continues to regard the treaty as binding and unaffected in anyway by a change of Rulers in Muscat. Sheikh Mohammad, in his conversations with the Sultan, continually referred to the ’’present existing treaty*. In face of this it would be untenable,if at any future date the Omani pleads the lapse of the treaty due to a change of Rulers in Muscat.Filially x would state that throughout Sheikh MjhainiDad* s visit, His Highness the Sultan most punctilli- ously kept me informed of the trend of the conversations and, in the guise of seeking my advice, readily told ms of his proposed line of action in each case*46 INDIA OFFICE, HITCHALL, U'J. 1. 29th January 1934. ivany thanks lor your iettor of to-aay.

Their support and favours to us are not recent but they have been of old and which are more valuable than the Zanzioar subsidy. Me are always grateful for their benevolence and expect to be supported by them as before. My friend the Government should be confident that we are always steadfast in observing the treaties which are existing between us and the Government as I have already pointed out in many of my letters. bith regard to the Arms Traffic Subsidy (which traffic |was stopped by the Muscat Government for the benefit of India) we are grateful to our friend the Government for tbeii Kindness in fixing that period in view of our present financial position. This is not their first favour to us but in the past they have done many other great favours to I have agieed to what has been decided by the Govern ment but I shall be much obliged if they reconsider the period which has been fixed by them.As regards my financial affairs I will try to make economy as far as possible and undoubtedly the Government are aware of the economies which I have made during the last year and will come to know of v/hat I will do in future. But until when should I uo these economies without increasing the Customs or other duties which are imposed in other countries of the world? I do not like to impose any tax on my subjects unless the Govern ment subjects taxe part in it because it is not fair that a tax be imposed on my subjects while the British subjects should be exempt of it.

To The Hon’hle the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Subject:- Muscat-Omani Treaty. Reference your No. 980-3 dated the 31st December 1932. On receipt of your telegram No. 49 dated 19th January 1933, I addressed the Sultan explaining the situation clearly to him, and pointing out that whilst the Govern ment of India would accept no responsibility in enforcing the treaty on either party thereto, they were prepared to give their 'good offices M in keeping the peace between them. Opportunity occured to day for further discussion of the matter and your suggestion for the stoppage of travel facilities to Omanis vas laid before His Highness. He is of the opinion that the closing of such facili ties would have little, if any, effect on the Omanis as many other ways of leaving the country are open to them. Under the circumstances His Highness does not propose to take any further action in the matter at this juncture. He has been requested to inform me, if he subsequently changes his mind, of any action he contemplates taking against the Omanis. Meanwhile, during a recent tour to Sib, I learned from two different sources that Isa bin Salih’s influence is somewhat on the wane. Whether ixx this is actually so or mere gossip I am not in a position to say. His second son Nazir, who visited Muscat some two months ago, passed through*^r 01 ) through the town enroute for Z^Jizibar a week ago. Though he is publicly said to have 'run away** without his father’s permission, my information is that he actually departed with full paternal sanction in order to obviate an open Quarrel between himself and his eldest brother. 3d/- O.E.U.

Wingate*s letter of 14th October 1920, to which reference is made in the Political Resident’s express letter, is flagged at A in the bounci volume. It gives a brief account of the history ana causes which' lea to the rebellion of the Cmani tribes of the interior of Luscat and to their separation from the Sultan’s dominions and also a detailed description of the events which inmediately preceded the conclusion (owing to the successful mediation of the Political Agent) of the treaty of 1920 between the late Sultan ana his subjects. Copies of the documents signed by the Sultan ana by the Chiani Sheikhs which give the terns of the agreement are at flag B. The agreement is a confirmation of the/TV % \ t l~a\ t/-*. the status quo and it appears to have worked satisfactorily hitherto. The interior of Oman and the coastal districts of the Sultanate are complementary from the economic point of view since most of the trade passing through the coast towns is in goods going to or coming from the interior, strained relations are therefore damaging to doth parties. Both the new Sultan ana the Omani Sheikns appear to regard the treaty as still hinaing, hut an inciaent has lately occurred of the murder of a Muscat State employee in Muscat territory hy men belonging, so the Muscat State alleges, to an Omani village. The Sultan has asked Sheikh Isa (the most powerful of the Orani Sheikh^ to hand over the murderers in accordance with the treaty, hut the * Sheikh returns evasive replies. r . • , The Sultan is now anxious to take action m the matter^'^T^ U ff* u '*** and he has asked the Political Agent, who has in turn consulted the Political Resident, for advice. There can he no question of H.M.G. or the Government of India intervening in this dispute except as mediators, hut in aavising the Sultan Colonel Powle intenus to emphasise the Sultan’s responsibility for British lives ana trade in any action he may take, since nearly all the traae is (or was in 1920) in the hanas of resident British subjects. On the other hand it is aifficult to see how we coula hola the sultan responsible for the trade losses of British subjects if he found it necessary, for example, to impose a penal zakat on trade coming from the interior in oraer to bring the Omanis to reason. Perhaps Colonel Fowle aoes not mean to go as far as this ana at any rate ip is to be hopea tnut a peaceful settlement may yet be obtained without recourse to coercive measures.There is nothing In the worhing of the Agreement of 1920 to suggest that it was intended to come to an end with the demise of either of the signatories, though admittedly there is no reference to ios continuing to hind the heirs or successors of either party, hut it seems a reasonable assumption (confirmed by the attitude both of the sultan and the Cmani Sheikhs, see paragraph 3 of Colonel Fowle’s letter) that this is the case. iVe may also agree with the Goverment of India that, while the conclusion of the .agreement was very largely aue to our co-operation with the then Sultan, it is not for us to enforce its terms, ana that we can to a certain extent stand aloof. On the other hand, we ought not to carry the policy of aisinteresting ourselves too far. If His Highness tries to deal with the situation more or less independently, hut fails in his object and difficulties arise with the Qnani tribes, X ~ h ‘ ' we should probably have to assist him against them if his aifficulties become really serious; and we are entitled, therefore, quite apart from the risk that individual British subjects might be prejudicially affected by the measures contemplated by the Sultan, to take an interest and advise him and even ^eeuiro-that our * advice snoul-a-fae talc on. But iiajor Bremner is in close touch with the Sultan, and trie Resident knows liuscat well; and while correspondence has had reference principally to/to the possible reactions of action by the Sultan on British subjects in Muscat, it may perhaps be assumed that the other points discussed above are present piyv-v*J2 ca/* w* Or^Ai^-C^wd CCaX^ - OS 14 .1 .7?** T 1 to .• B i w By Air Mail ^ f*' r\xysJ Confident! al&lt; OO &gt;- is Or U: A O l j r &lt;&lt;^f. dated Copy of an express letter No* 5979-^0^^32. 31st Decan'ber 1932, from the Political Resident, Bushire, to 5breign, Few Delhi.

On the abdication of the late Sultan of Muscat and the accession of the present one last January, the latter was of the opinion that the above Treaty, originally made between the late Sultan and the Omani Siaikhs, would need renewal, and some correspondence passed on the subject between myself • as Political Jscnt, Muscat - and the late Sir Hugh Biscoe. Both parties apparently desired a renewal and it was finally decided that we should stand aloof and let things take their course. 3. No actual steps have been taken towards a renewal, but both parties, the present Sultan and the Omani Siaikhs, headed by Shaikh Isa bin Saleh* apparently regard the Treaty as still binding on them. 4. An incident has occurred of the murder of a Muscat State enployee, in Muscat territory, the murderers being alleged by the Muscat State - on the evidence of local trackers, etc. • to belong to an Omani village. The &amp;iltan has addressed 3uaikh Isa to hand over the murderers in ^ &lt;0 cv?accordance with the Agreement of 1920 affected by Mr. £ &amp; ' o? ^ T ^ ^ $ Wingate, but the $iaikh returns evasive replies. (He does / S S: ? / O Uj j cr f Q ^ CV not contend that the Treaty no longer exists, which confirms my impression (paragraph 3 above) that he regards it as / still6. 7-i still having force.) 5. The following are extracts from a Memorandum received from the Political Agent, Muscat, on the suhj ect. 3. The gist of the Sultan’s conversation with 'me is as follows t- M (i ) Is the British Government going to keep the peace between the parties ? (i.e. presumably enforce the agreement); (ii) If not then His Highness wishes to be free to take such action as he thinks fit without interference on our part; (iii) If such action involves loss to a British subject he cannot hold himself responsibl e. X X X X X •B. His Highness cannot at present indicate to w me lahat line he would adopt should he be,given a free hand. It is obvious that he cannot be permitted to refute all responsibility should a British subject be involved through destruction of property or loss of life, but should the individual f s trade be affected then it should be merely regarded as 'the fortune of war' for which no responsibility attaches. I think it unlikely however that the Omanis would deliberately ham any British subject for fear of the consequences. I would be grateful if you would communicate your views on the subject to me at your earliest con veni ence JBbx to permit of His Highness formulating his proposals. He is most anxious that the matter should not hang fire any longer, thereby encouraging the Omanis to the detriment of his own authority.' H M N N * N M N N N -« H6. In any advice which I may tender to His Highness I shall of course he most careful to emphasise that he cannot divest himself of responsibility for British lives or trade in any action that he may talce# Before replying to him, however, I would be grateful for a confirmation by telegrgn that the Government of India concur in my vises of our responsibility as to the Treaty, i.e* that Mr. Wingat was merely a mediator between the Sultan and the Ctoanis, and that the Government of India therefore have no responsibility in enforcing it on either party, though of course they are prepared to give their 'good offices', as far as the efforts of their officials in the Gulf a re concerned, in keeping the peace between the parties. I do not propose to publish these views for the information of the Omanis, but I think they should be explained to the Sultan.a Tel eg ram Ho. 142.

The Foreign Office have represented orally that they would much prefer that a communication should he made to the Netherlands Government at the same time as to the French and the U.5«A. They have not yet sent instructions to Paris and Washington and will wait till they hear from us on this point before doing so. Since our letter of 4th October was drafted the Dutch have made a formal request for the Sultan’s permission to fly over, and land at, Gwadur, and if the French and Dutch are to be allowed to use the Arab Coast Route it seems inevitable that they should come more into contact with the Arab principalities of the Gulf. On the vihole it is doubtful whether there is now enough ground for objecting to a communication being made to the Dutch if the Foreign Office want to make one, and I have put up a draft for approval saying that we are prepared to agree.I do not know thut there is very much in the point. Cn the whole the balance of advantage at an earlier stage seemed to rest with making no formal communication to the Dutch and trusting to the Sultan's not reverting to his request that we should do so. But there is something in the Foreign Office argument that now that we are corresponding with the Dutch on behalf of His Highness it might be desirable formally to intimate to them his accession to the Throne,and we might perhaps agree to uo so. It seems very unlikely that the Dutch will actively interest themselves in anything in the Gulf except flying possibilities.r 5 OCT iwz A .or x X ■Tv / f ^v, 3 CONFIDENTIAL. / /1^. z J No. F.I70-N/32. 2 /W From To ik.

INDIA OFFICE Sir, I am directed dy the Secretary of State to refer to the previous correspondence noted in the margin i on the subject of a communication to the interested foreign governments regarding the accession of the present Sultan of Muscat, ana to forward for the information of the Secretary of State for | Foreign Affairs copy of a d.o. letter aated 13th August from the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. 2. Sir Samuel Hoare entirely agrees with the Government of India as to the desirability of a corrmunication to the Government of the United | States and the Government of the i jFrench Republic in the sense desired I by the Sultan of Muscat. He is, however, inclined to think, subject to the observations of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the balance of advantage rests with making no communication to the Netherlands Government. While the Netherlands Government have a Commercial Convention with Muscat, so far as is known trade between the two countries is negligible, if 904 4000 5.32 indeed/ z# 37 'T a. indeed it can he regarded as existing at all, and in view of the general undesirability of encouraging any foreign interest in the petty principalities of the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf, Sir Samuel Hoare, if Sir John Simon sees no strong objection, thinks that it would be preferable that in accordance with the precedent of 1913 no communication should therefore be macie to the Dutch Government. It will be remembered in this connection that no communication has been made to tha.1^ Government in connection with the recent discussions in regard to the possible amendment of the Muscat Commercial Treaties with the United States and with Prance. 34) ^0 4 WALTON o- CfjL,To BY.

Sir Hugh Biscoe’s views on future policy SoLt-^ctf ScXA 4 fin Hiiscat now that has succeeded are given in his despatch of the 7th April on P.Z.2437/32. In jthat despatch the late Resident raised the question ! (consequent on discussion with the. new Sultan) of the possible denunciation of the French and American |treaties with Muscat and it was agreed that this I question should he taken up demi^officially with the Foreign Office in the hope that they might he able to ;suggest some method of releasing Muscat from the !burden of treaties concluded almost a century ago in ■very different circumstances from those which prevail !to-day. I.*- The Government of India, in their letter of 11th May, on P.Z.3146, express general agreement with Sir Hugh Biscoe’s views on the question of policy and t agree in particular that the present Sultan should be encouraged to take an active part in the administration of the State and to rule Muscatjon Arab lines with as little interference in internal affairs on our part as possible. With this view we may express entire agreement. It is consistent with the policy which we [have of late years been trying so far as possible to i follow in the Gulf. On the question of the possible denunciation of the Muscat treaties reference is invited to paragraph 3 of the Government of India’s letter. The question was discussed informally/with the Foreign Office, who were asked to examine it and to give us the benefit of their views. These are contained in Foreign Office letter of 17th July, on P.Z.4319, now submitted* As/ r 40(10 3 32mamaum J As will tie seen, the general effect of the Foreign Office letter is that on the basis of strict law it seems likely that Muscat could, subject to reasonable notice, denounce her treaties with France and the United States or at least the provisions in them which are of a commercial nature. But the position is complicated by the fact that, particularly in the case of the French treaty, the treaties in question contain provisions of a semi- capitulatory nature similar to those embodied in our own treaties with Muscat and that the question might, therefore, arise whether in these circumstances the treaties must stand or fall as a whole or whether it would be possible to denounce some of their provisions only. T' But the real objection seen by the Foreign Office to denunciation of these treaties, and I fear that we must admit that is the political objection. It would be impossible to persuade the French or the United States that Muscat, given its special relation to | H.M.G. and the degree of control which we are known to exercise over it, was not acting under pressure - from H.M.G. in taking action to denounce treaties of a standing such as those now under consideration. The position would be aggravated by the retention ^ substantially in their present form of the capitulatory and other privileges contained in our treaties with Muscat.* the argument (an entirely honest one) that neither France nor the United States has any practical interest In Muscat nowadays, while her relation with H.M.G. and the Government of India is of a quite special character, would be unlikely to carry any conviction to the foreign governments concerned/Minute Paper. Department concerned. It seems impossible in these circumstances, much as we migrht have wished to give more elbow-room to the new Sultan to hold out any hope to him of being able in the near future to denounce, or substantially to modify, his French and American treaties, and I submit that we must accept the foreign Office view (which is much what the Government of India had anticipated) and leave matters as they are. We are not without hope of ; devising an arrangement in regard to tariffs which i will ease the position on the commerical side, and if this can be achieved it will relieve the pressure of the treaties at the point at which it is most felt ( by the State. i 5. The Foreign Office in para. 6 of their letter refer to the vtoh that the abrogation of the French ! and U.3. treaties might ultimately react on our own position in Muscat by producing a demand for the abrogation of the special privileges v/hich we at present enjoy there. The point Is of academic interest only if, as suggested above, the general political objections to encouraging the Sultan unilaterially to denounce or to endeavour to modify, those f treaties are insuperable. I doubt, however, if, in any case, there is much in it. If the Muscat State under its new ruler were to attain financial stability and to regain control over the tribes of the hinterland, we might indeed be faced with a demand on her partfor some modification of our existing j agreements. But the prospects, unfortunately, of any such development in the near future are relatively j slight and the danger of it, if any, would not be of conclusive/ 40U0 3 32conclusive importance in deciding to advise Muscat to abrogate her other foreign treaties if on other grounds this was considered a desirable and practicable course. 6.

DRAFT LETTER . a S AUG 1952 Ttie Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign &amp; Political Dept., Simla. In reply to Sir E. Howell’s letter of 11th May, No. D.1673-&gt;{/32, I am directed hy the Secretary of State to say that he agrees with the Sir Hugh Biscoe's views as set out in his letter of 7th April, No.215-S, in regard to the policy to he pursued in future dealings with the despatch of 7th April, to he at liberty to modify or to determine the treaties of 1833 and 1844 with the Government of the United States | and the French Government Jrespectively. Those treaties were concluded in circumstances very different from those which prevail at the present day and the attitude of the new ruler in regard to them is understandable. In the light of the observations in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Government of India's letter under reply, enquiries were ‘ the Foreign Office as to the i Government of India in ac^p^ring Muscat State. ^ The Secretary of State enti-^e^r sympathises with the desire of the Sultan of Muscat, as recorded in paragraph 5 of Sir Hugh Biscoe's possibility/A~ vWv c~^\. possibility of denunciation. The observations of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs are contained in Foreign Office letter of 19th July, No. E.3243/4/91, of which copies were sent to the Government of India and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by the mail of 21st July. It will be seen that while, in Sir John Simon 1 s opinion, it seems likely that on the basis of strict law/Muscat State could, upon giving reasonable notice, denounce its treaties with France and the United States, or at least the provisions in them which are of a commercial nature, the political objections to any such action on its part are substantial. The Government of India, in their letter under reply, had already expressed their apprehension that the denunciation of the treaties would inevitably be attributed to the influence of H.M.G. and not to the spontaneous policy of the sultan of Muscat, that it would be regarded as almost an unfriendly a£t and would certainly cause resentment out of all proportion to the advantage to be gained. The Secretary of Stateim 4000 5.32 Draft Paper.

The Muscat State's treaties with France and the United States, of 1833 and 1844 respectively, contain no clause specifying that they may be terminated. They contain provisions of varying character, the majority of them, including those which are the cause of the present difficulty regarding the Muscat Tariff, being provisions of a commercial treaty character, while others are of rather a different nature , certain of these in the Treaty with France being somewhat analogous to capitulations. 3. The Secretary of State is advised that, according to the prevailing view, provisions of a commercial nature are presumed to be not indeterminable, and, in the absence of express provisions, can be determined on reasonable notice. Provisions of the other kind are, however, not subject to this presumption. The point in the case of the I The Under Secretary of State, India Office. COPY S£NT ENCLOSURE IN WtEKLY LL TTtri No. »29 2 ) ^ FROM secretary, political and BECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICEc the Muscat treaties is in fact very similar to that on which the Law Officers of the Crown advised in an Opinion given on May 28th, 1909 in regard to the Anglo-Venezuelan treaty of 1834, In that opinion the Law Officers, although admitting that the point was not clear, expressed the view that treaties of a commercial nature, which contain no express provisions governing termination, could nevertheless he determined upon reasonable notice. In the case of the Muscat treaties, the issue would be somewhat complicated, since the question might arise whether, if some of the provisions of the treaties are clearly not of a commercial but of a permanent character, the treaties must stand or fall as a whole, or whether it would be possible to denounce some of their provisions only. On the whole, however, if the matter is considered on the basis of strict law, it seems likely that the Muscat State could, upon giving reasonable notice, denounce these treaties with Prance and the United States, or at least the provisions in them which are of a commercial nature. It appears doubtful whether, as the Government of India suggest, the matter turns on the clausula ’’rebus sic stantibus”. At any rate, if it were decided to endeavour to denounce the treaties, the arguments set out above would probably be stronger tnan those founded on the clausula ’’rebus sic stantibus”. 4. While the preceding paragraphs deal with the position from the strictly legal point of view, I am to add that Sir John Simon considers^from the political standpoint any attempt to denounce these treaties on behalf of the Muscat State would be likely to give rise to difficulties with the French and United States Governments inin view of the correspondence which has already passed between His Majesty’s Government and those Governments regarding the proposed modification of certain clauses of these treaties by negotiation. 5. Moreover, His Majesty’s Government would find themselves in a somewhat invidious position vis-a-vis the French Government, if the Sultan, acting under the advice of His Majesty’s Government, denounced the French Treaty as a whole, thus abolishing the quasi-capitulatory! privileges accorded therein, while agreeing to the retention by His Majesty’s Government of the similar privileges granted to this country under the commercial treaty with Muscat of 1891. 6. A further consideration should not in Sir John Simon’s opinion be overlooked. It is true that the Sultan of Muscat in his conversation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf recorded in paragraph 5 of the latter’s despatch No* 215 - S of the 7th April to the Government of India (a copy of which was enclosed in your letter No. P.Z. 2347/32 of the 20th April), acknowledged that His Majesty’s Government had a moral right to expect special treatment from the Muscat State. None the less it appears not improbable that the abolition of the quasi-capitulatory rights accorded to France would sooner or later lead the Muscat State to aim at the abolition of the similar privileges enjoyed in Muscat by this country. 7. In all the circumstances. Sir John Simon suggests, for the consideration of Sir Samuel Hoare, that the Sultan should be given no encouragement to contemplate the unilateralunilateral denunciation either of the whole or of the commercial clause^only of Muscat's treaties with foreign powers* I am.i Copy of a letter No.397-S of 1932, dated the 16th June 19 32, from the Kon’hle the Political .Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to the foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. tfith reference to foreign and Political Department letter Fo .f.40-N/31, dated the 9th May 1932, I have the honour to state that it has 'been ascertained from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat that his father, Sir Taimur hin faisal, left India on the 27th November last, visited Ceylon and then went on to Burma, where he now is.

Subject-Abolition of the Council cf Ministers at Muscat. Sir, I am directed to refer to letter from the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, M r o.215-S of 1932, dated the 7th April 1932, a copy of which was sent to you direct, and to say that the Govern ment of India are in general agreement with Political Residents views in regard to the policy to be pursued in future dealings with the Muscat State. They agree that the present Sultan should be encouraged to take an active part in the administration of the State and to rule the State on Arab lines with as little interference in internal affairs as possible. 2. The Resident in paragraph 5 of his letter attributes to the Government of India, expression in the irTiiieir telegram ]lo.669 01 the 1st March 1932 of the view that he had perhaps exaggerated the Sultan’s desire to safeguard the dignity of his State. I am to explain that the remarks in that telegram were intended to suggest that in the opinion of the Government of India the Political Resident had perhaps exaggerated the objections to the grant of most-favoured-nation treatment to the United states of America in respect of personal status for their subjects and not that he had made an overstatement of facts which were within his knowledge# 3. The Government of India have also read with interest the discussions held by the Political Resident with His Highness the Sultan regarding the possibility of denunciation by the Muscat State c£ her Treaties with Foreign Powers. They had already given this question their careful consideration and had arrived at the following provisional conclusions. While tte Muscat Treaties both with France and America are drawn sub spec ie aeterni tatis . the authorities agree that all treaties are to be understood as having a tacit condition that they remain only valid rebus sic stantibus . Until the Great War it could not be said that there has been any material variation in the position which would justify denunciation of her treaties by Muscat* Since the Great War there has been a tendency in all countries to raise tariff rates and it might be held that in respect of the relevant Articles of these two Treaties things had now changed so much that denunciation of those Articles would be justified* But no cases are apparently any where on record in which denunciation has not been preceded, either by internal revolution or some violent^ tfrt^rfr-lA. - ^ ^ ^ c, JU4L w^ &gt; *^/ J ^ ^ M. &lt;-&lt; i£ M/J violent constitutional change, v/hich produced a different outlook &amp;n external affairs in the Government of the State responsible for denunciation. At Muscat there has been no such change, and if the Treaties were to be denounced, France and America and all the world would /! attrioute the act to the influence of His Majesty^s Government and not to tne spontaneous policy of the Sultan oi Muscat* It would be regarded as almost an unfriendly act and would certainly cause resentment out of all proportion to the advantage to be gained. foming these conclusions the Government of India were impressed by the fact that it did not seem to have occurred to His Majesty’s Government, with their much wider experience of international affairs, to regard denunciation of the Treaties as a possible solution* They would however request to be favoured with an authoritative opinion from His Majesty’s Government on this point.% ( -TCiTE&gt; COPY Vi nc j O !

In forwarding this cosnaunication the Political Agent has reported that Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal, an uncle of His Highness the Sultan, has been placed in charge of internal affairs, while Shaikh ^iubair bin Ali has been placed in charge of the administration of justice. As the Govern ment of India are aware, Captain R. G. Alban fills the appointment of Financial Adviser in addition to that of Comaandant of the -^evies. 3. These arrangements are, I think,satisfactory. Saiyid Hamad is a capable and fairly well-eduaated man, he was formerly ^ali of Sohar where he was left for a consider able period with little or no supervision on the part of the State 9$d his conduct was not altogether satisfactory. Hi s ...—4 ( (S3 - 2 - His Highness, however, informs me that he works satisfactorily as long as he is supervised, which he will be in his present post v He is probably the most capable member of the ruling family, and in Muscat it is exceedingly difficult to get anyone with the requisite energy or ability to hold administrative posts* Shaikh Zubair is a quiet, steady-going individual who was formerly on the Council for many years past, and will, I hope, supervise the administration of justice adequately* His Highness does not desire that these persons should receive the title of 'Ministers*, and I think proposes to take a very active part in the administration himself* 4* In this connection I would venture to put before the Government of India certain considerations which, I think, should guide us in our future dealings with the Muscat State, and which are the outcome of numerous cnversations which 1 have had an different occasions with His Highness the Sultan. We have now to deal with a very different personality to that of the Ex-Sultan, Saiyid Taimur. We have ourselves given to Saiyid Said a better education and wider outlook than was possessed by any of his predecessors* He has been educated partly at Baghdad and was for four years at the Mayo College, Ajmere* It is inevitable unuer these circumstances that he should have become imbued with, I will not say a nationalistic outlook, for this wo Id be too strong an expression, but with some of that desire for independence that is moving so many Oriental nations nowadays* He is young, full of energy and % zeal and most eager to see the State flourishing and well- administered* On the other hand he is sensible and does realise how dependent he is upon the support of the Government of India and he is most genuinely grateful for the help they have given him lately. When one gets to know himjhe is a very * *.▼cry attractive personality and I da not think he will ue difficult to deal with, provided he is not, if I may use an expression so much in vogue on this side ol the Gulf, 'pin- pricked 1 * over minor matters, and given at least that measure of autonomy which is enjoyed toy the States in India* 5 # To illustrate my meaning I would mention that in a discussion which 1 had with His Highness at Sur regarding the finances of the State, the question of the increase of tariff came up and His Highness asked me about the difficulties that had arisen in connection with obtaining the consent of the American Government* I mentioned that, as he was aware, the American Government in return for their consent were asking .'Y-J/ i &amp; rf ' for most favoured nation treatment in respect of personal status for their subjects* In my Express Letter No.75-S of 12th February 1932, 1 expressed the view that the State were unwilling to give this most favoured nation treatment to American subjects largely for reasons of amour propre. In their telegram Ho*669 of 1st March 1932 to the Secretary ol State for India, the Government of India expressed the view that I had perhaps exaggerated somewhat this sentiment. I can assure the Government of India that this is not so. His Highness spoke very strongly on the subject of these treaties and asked whether the State was to be bound for ever by treaties entered into a century ago with his ignorant fore fathers, and whether the State could not denounce them. *Surely', he said,' there must toe some way of ending a treaty”. He went on to ask why he should give the same treatment to American subjects as he accorded to British subjects; his relations with the British were totally different to those with any other State. He owed much to the British but nothing to other countries. I could not help feeling much sympathy with *.«with His Highness* point of view. 6. Again, some Muscat subjects in Charbar are encountering certain difficulties about passports with the Persians, and have appealed to the Muscat State ior assistance* His Highness has addressed a letter to the Political Agent saying that if his subjects in Charbar are ill-treated he will retaliate on Persian subjects resident in luscat. I am inTestigating the matter, but merely mention these incidents now as examples of the feelings and character of the Sultan with whom we are called on to deal. 7 . I hare always been anxious to encourage Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf to administer their own States with as little interference by us in internal affairs as possible. Je are adopting this policy elsewhere, and it is in accordance with present day views and sentiment: moreover I believe it to oe the most advantageous policy for ourselves, as was strongly emphasised by the Government of India in respect of Bahrain, in their telegram 0.3453-3 of 27th isiovember 1929 to His Majesty*s Secretary of State for India. As regards the particular case of Bahrain, owm^ to the total ineffectiveness and incompetence of the present ruler, I see little alternative but virtually to carry on the administration of the State ourselves through the Financial Adviser, but I venture to express my entire concurrence with the general policy outlined in the telegram referred to above. I think there is no doubt that not only Bahrain but also Muscat has been a cause of ”signs of Arab uneasiness on the i'rucial Coast' which has added considerably to our difficulties there, and that 'after all it is not only vis-a-vis the Arabs that it is politic far us to work through a genuinely Arab administration. It actually increases our power vis-a-vis foreign intruders: thus1 • •T~— -5- (fsP, thus an obrieusly autonomous Arab State can close its ioors in a way in which an bbriously British run State cannot”. q # To sum up: We hare now in Muscat a youn^ Sultan who if tactfully handled should, I think, turn out a go ruler. He should, I thin, be given every chance t ) administer his State on Arab lines and every effort should be made to iree him from those relics of the past which are galling to him, while we should try at the same time to cuild up a facade o, independence in the eyes of the world. I do not think there is any risk of his failing to abide by his undertaking to be guided by us in important matters; he is certainly desirous of retain ing Captain Alban’s services as long as possible and told me that he felt that he would for many years to come need the services of a European to manage the finances of his Stato, since there was nb local official who was in any way competent to do so.

Muscat subsidies. 1. Zanzibar. Subsidy. Y/e agree that this should be continued to new Sultan subject to his living in terms of amity and friend-' ship with His Majesty's Government and faithfully observing his V treaty engagements. 2. Arms traffic&lt;&gt; Subsidy. As this subsidy ms personal to late Sultan, we are of opinion that at any rate under its present designation it should now cease. But in order to prevent State from falling into complete financial chaos we propose continuing payment of amount hitherto paid (Rs.. 1,00,000/- per . annum) for a period of three years as suggested by Resident. * We are however of opinion that continuance of this subsidy, whether now or on expiry of this period is merely a question of expediency and we suggest that it should be made clear to new Sultan and State Council that further extension cannot be counted on and that consequently during next three years finances of State must be so organised that it will be able to meet loss ofsubsidy at close of period Issue of the above has been authorised. Deputy Secretary to the Government of India#&gt;&gt; ft' HtJuJ* In 1876 a Committee composed of Sir Louis Mallet, Mr. H.C. Rothery and Mr. W.H. Wylde, was deputed respectively by the Treasury, Foreign Office and India Office to consider certain questions outstanding between the Imperial Government and the Government of India relative to the Muscat Subsidy and the Zanzibar Agency and Consulate. Their report, which gives the earlier history, is flagged. te cost of the Zanzibar Agency, etc., so that from then until 1882 H.M.G. and the G. of I. each paid a moiety of the subsidy and the cost of the Zanzibar Agency. In 1882 the Foreign Office proposed that (1) The Imperial Government should take over the entire patronage, control and payment of the Zanzibar Agency Establishment, with its incidental costs and pension liabilities. (2) The Indian Government to assume entire responsibility for the Muscat Subsidy. (3) The Muscat Subsidy to be looked upon as terminable, so far as any responsibility of either of the two Governments is concerned, on the death or failure to fulfil his treaty engagements of Syed Toorkee of Muscat. (4) The Indian Government to abstain from any attempt after the death of Syed Toorkee, to enforce payment of the subsidy by Zanzibar and to use its influence to prevent any endeavour on the part of Muscat to obtain it by force. India, it was pointed out that its immediate result would be a small increase of charge to India, and that the increase would be permanent in the event of it not being found With effect from 1872 H.M.G. agreed to pay half In referring the proposal to the Government of consistent/consistent with the obligations of the Government of India under Lord Canning^ award of 1861, or with Indian interests in the Persian Gulf, to allow the subsidy now paid to lapse on the death of Syed Toorkee. The Secretary of State said in his despatch: w Possibly Your Excellency in Council may not deem it necessary to determine positively at this moment what, upon the occurrence of that contingency, shall be done as regards the subsidy. But it must be clearly understood that if the proposal under consideration be accepted, the payment if continued in whole or in part, whether upon grounds of obligation or upon those of political expediency, will have to be defrayed from the Indian Treasury. H The Government of India did not consider that they would be justified in accepting the transfer on the terms proposed because (1) if the subsidy became a permanent charge upon their Treasury, they would be - as they were told would be the case - pecuniary losers by the transaction; while (2) if their obligation in the matter be held to end with the death of the present ruler of Muscat, his successor could not be debarred from attempting to enforce his rights against Zanzibar, the connection between the two principalities would again be revived in some form or other and an Indian Political Agency at Zanzibar would again become necessary. The Government of India were informed that H.M.G. definitely considered the guarantee cf the Muscat Subsidy undertaken by the two Governments as a consequence of Sir Barbie Frere's Mission of 1873 to be of a temporary character, only binding during the lifetime of, and the observance ofhis treaty engagements by ; Syed Toorkee, the then Sultan of Muscat, and that whether the Government of India accepted the proposal or not, they (H.M.G.) would not continue to pay a moiety on his death• In that event the Government of India, if they refused to accept the Foreign Office proposal, would find themselves saddled with the whole subsidy - if they decided to continue its payment - and in addition some of the liabilities which H.M.G. were willing to assume under the proposed settlement. Under this settlement India would pay the whole Subsidy, Rs.84,600, instead of a moiety of the two services, Rs.71,387, or an excess of Rs.15,013. But against this must be set off the estimated annual pension liabilities, viz .. Rs.5,168. The nett increase was therefore Rs.8,045. The Secretary of State, who was of the opinion that, taking all facts into consideration, the increase of charge involved was too trivial to constitute the sole ground for postponing a change desirable in itself and inevitable hereafter, asked the Government of India to reconsider the matter in this light. They did so and telegraphed m accepting the proposal. In their despatch confirming the telegram the Government of India still argued that the settlement was unjust and pleaded for a fairer settlement, on the ground that H.M.G.'s repudiation of their liability in connection with the subsidy on Toorkee 1 s death was not justified, (though they admit in another part of the same despatch that the engagement entered into with Toorkee referred only to British revenues and did not affect the Canning award). They asked the Secretary of State to support their appeal for a contribution from H.M.G. in order to prevent any additional expense falling on Indian revenues. They/*jr JU3^^ ' Wv,^' They argued that the assurance given in 1873 as a result of Sir B. Frere*s mission that the subsidy would be paid to Toorkee during his lifetime applied only to H.M.G.’s portion • and that they were bound to pay the subsidy fixed by the Canning settlement or allow the Sultan of Muscat to collect it by force. The Secretary of State agreed with the Government of India's view regarding their liability to pay the subsidy fixed by Lord Canning's award, but was unable to obtain any concession from V H.M.G. and accepted the arrangements proposed by the Foreign Office, which came into force on 1st September, 1883. From the foregoing it is clear, I think, that there are no grounds on which the Government of India can reasonably claim to be released of their liability. They took the view that they were bound to continue to pay the subsidy to Toorkee's heirs and successors - H.M.G. took the opposite view, though when the settlement was made they had no further interest in the matter. Personally, though I say so with great temerity, I think thekj view that they were bound by the 1861 award is open to doubt ari that it could be claimed, as H.M.G. did claim, that the agreement came to an end when the ruling house to whom the promise was made lost control, and that when Toorkee took control a new promise to pay him an annual subsidy during his rule was made H.M.G. and the Government of India. °l^ Jkj ^ujLuA' tj. — ^ (U ^ t V 6vvJ.LvJ:w IksUj •'Uusn Tv*!- (X^Cc-f bj -t-f lu^Ll 'Lt t fo \f(LA//U &lt;~d ^ I ^ li I J ^'*'1 equally binding on n j W ,v •r. Clauson , Responsibility for the Zanzibar subsidy was assumed by the Government of India m the following circumstances. Office The Foreign/proposed m 1382 that the Imperial Government should assume responsibility for all charges m connection with the Agency at Zanzibar on certain conditions (paragraph 3 of the Government of India’s despatch of 30th January, 1833), one of which was that the Luscat subsidy (until then paid m moieties from Imperial and Indian funds) should become a charge on Indian revenues. Acceptance of this arrangement involved an immediate increase in expenditure. The Indian moiety of the combined cost of the Agency and subsidy was at that time Rs.71,387; the subsidy alone amounted to Rs.86,400. Deducting Rs.5,168 (the estimated annual value of pension liabilities, which would in future be borne by II.h.G.) from the cost of the subsidy, the Indian Treasury was called upon to spend an additional Rs.9,856 per annum (letter to Foreign Office of 14th l arch, 1883 - para. 9). The Government of India’s despatch of 50th January, 1883, recapitulates the views expressed by the Secretary of State in putting the Foreign Office proposals to them, and the considerations which led to their telegraphic acceptance of those proposals on certain conditions. The Secretary of State had suggested that by accepting the arrangement in question, India might in the long run stand to gain at the cost of the small immediate increase involved, though he pointed out that this hypothetical gain depended to a large extent on a decision whether or not the subsidy could be regarded as terminable on the death of Saiyid Turki. He made it clear at the same time/what ever decision was taken on this/this question, if the Fore ign Off ice proposals were accepted any payment to I'uscat would have in future to be borne by India- The Government of India were prepared to admit that there was some advantage in getting rid of dual responsibility for the Agency, but considered that it was not such as to compensate them for the additional expenditure they would incur. They were unwilling to commit themselves without first deciding whether or not the increase would be permanent. In their view the Camng award applied not only to Saiyid Turki himself, but to his successors so long as the conditions on which the award was made were fulfilled. Since the Government of India could not regard responsibility for payment of the subsidy as ceasing on the death of Saiyid Turki, they would be forced either to bring pressure to bear on Zanzibar to pay, or to allow the Sultan of ! use at to enforce his claims, and they therefore found themselves unable to accept the last tw r o clauses of the settlement proposed by the Foreign Office. This being so, they considered that the arrangement was disadvantageous to India. The Secretary of State had expressed the opinion that the 1? oreign Office proposals should be accepted. As those proposals were put forward in Imperial interests, he agreed that India ought not to be expected to bear any additional expenditure. On the whole, however, he saw advantage in acquiescence, in view of the fact that n.k.u. held strongly to the view that the subsidy was terminable on the death of Saiyid Turki, and so would probably refuse to make any contribution towards the subsidy if continued to a future Sultan of : uscat, in which case, if the arrangement now proposed were not accepted, India would have to bear the whole cost of the subsidy plus a moiety of the Agency ex ^'he /( 2 &gt; The Government of India, in paragraph 7 of their desnatch, reiterated their view of the joint responsibility of the two Governments for payment of the subsidy, and were anxious that an effort should be made to secure some concession from If this was impossible, they were prepared to resign themselves to acceptance of the settlement. They considered that it was as much in Imperial as in Indian interests to prevent hostilities between Zanzioar and juscat, and, as these would be almost inevitable if the subsidy were not paid, H.l'.G. could not, in their opinion, divest themselves entirely of responsibility. The Government of India left the decision as to acceptance of the settlement to the Secretary of State. on receipt of the Government of India’s despatch representations in the sense desired by them were made to the Foreign Office (letter of 14th F.arch, 1883), though it was considered very improbable that any concession was likely. was The letter pointed out that since the transfer/preposed in connection with arrangements for the suppression of the slave trade - a matter primarily of importance to the Imperial Government - it was unreasonable to expect India to bear any increase in expenditure, and suggested that while ohe subsidy continued to be paid to Lluscat, H.L.G. should contribute t-iie sum of £1,000 per annum as a slave trade grant. Subject to this, it was proposed to accept the foreign Office proposals. In reply the Foreign Office declined to make any contribution to the cost of the subsidy, and (.letter of 6th June, 1883) the Secretary of State accepted the settlement suggested by the Foreign Office. The Government of India were informed on 31st July/ illJuly that from 1st September, 1883, the Imperial Government would take over all charges in connection with the Zanzibar Agency, being relieved at the same time of all liability for the bus cat subsidy, which would be paid by India (paragraph 2). A final decision as to whether the subsidy should be continued after the death of Saiyid Turki was left to be taken at a later date. In view of the fact that the subsidy was renewed m 1873 to induce the then Sultan of 1 use at to sign an anti- Slave Trade Treaty, there would appear to have been considerable force in the Government of India's claim for a contribution from the Home Treasury, but a final conclusion on this could only be arrived at in the light of a decision as to whether or not H.k.G. were right in considering the subsidy to be terminable on the death of SaiyidTurki. /&lt;.

Sir In continuation of my telegram Uo.40 of 13th February 1932, I have the honour to enclose herewitha letter in Arabic, with English translation addressed to you by His Highness. 2. His Highness* accession took place on the 10th instant without incident. There was a certain amount of discussion between his uncles when they were informed of the late Sultans abdication, but the latter* s letter to His Highness nominating him as his successor, and your letter conveying the fact that the accession had the approval of His Majesty’s Government disposed of any serious opposition that might have been offered. As a matter of fact considering that His Highness had already acted virtually as Sultan in his capacity of President of the Council, that he was the eldest son of Sir Taimur bin Faisal, and that he was generally looked on as the Heir Apparent, no other member of the Royal Family had any claims to the throne. 3 # The only one of His Highness’ many uncles who was at all- 2 - (ay all recalcitrant was the eldest of them Saiyid Nadir, and his attitude was actuated not in any way by personal ambition but by fears for himself. On the morning of the 9th I was informed by Captain Alban, on behalf of His Highness, that all the/uncles, who had been informed on the 7th instant of the approaching accession, had agreed to support it with the exception of Saiyid Nadir, who still held out, and who announced his intention of interviewing the Political Agent* He, His Highness, had no objection. I had no wish of course to interfere in the family differences of the Royal Family, but as this was an important matter I sent a message to Saiyid Nadir saying that I would be pleased to see him. 4. Saiyid Nadir talked to me for a long time, his refrain being: if His Hi^iness ’did anything against him’ would I - as Political Agent - help him. I informed him,politely but firmly, that His Highness was Sultan, and that I had no intention of interfering in such obviously internal affairs as the relation between the Sultan and his uncles. I purposely kept the con versation, as far as I was concerned, on a light note, and refused to take Saiyid Nadir’s apprehensions seriously. I introduced a little judicious flattery by saying that instead of harbouring these fantastic fears he should be thinking of how he could best help His Highness with his advice and assistance which doubtless would be most useful. Saiyid Nadir finally took his leave looking rather lugubrious, but apparently toy advice had a beneficial effect as - having got nothing out of me - I heard afterwards that he hastened to His Highness and effusively offered him his full support. I informed the Sultan later of my conversation with his uncle. His highness said * that he was grateful for the good advice I had given Saiyid Nadir, and added with a smile that he imagined that the latter’s app re hens ionsr * v tt ^ / apprehensions were concerned with a possible cut in his allowance. 5. On the 11th instant, as arranged with His Highness I na.de ray offical call on him, with Captain Mackay, to offer ray congratulations on the ’Id and on his accession. There were present.members of the Royal Family and notables. I made a short speech to which His Highness replied. 6. As far as can be judged the abdication of Sir Tairaur bin Faisal and the accession of His Highness have caused little t stir or excitement in Muscat. The late Sultan owing to his prolonged absence from his dominions had faded out of the picture, and his son was looked on as the inevitable heir. Moreover the population of Muscat are commercially not politically minded, and such matters as the export price of dates and fish, and the import price of piece-goods, together with the rise and fall of the fiollar, are probably of more real interest to them, especially I i in these hard times, than the accession of a new Sultan. Such interest as has been displayed in the town is all in favour of i His Highness. The tribes along the coast, and in the interior, will dohbtless display more concern. When indications of their attitude are received I will submit a further report. I have the honour to be.

You state that you have informed His Majesty’s Government of this and that the High Government have been pleased to recognise me as Sultan of Muscat and ’Oman. I would request you to convey my thanks to the High Government.

I would request you to inform the High Government that it is not hidden from me that I shall endure in my rule by the continuance of their help and assistance to me and my Government in the same manner as my ancestors were helped by them. And it is hoped that you will assure the aforesaid Government that I have accepted all the obligations to the High Government descending to me from my father and that I am determined to follow his policy in all my relations with Uovernment and that I rely on the help of the Government and declare that in accordance with the wishes of my father I will be guided by its S views in important matter, as I am assured that the Government K willXI will not be pleased except in what profits my State and desires the maintenance of the independence of our Government and Sultanale.

'Fowey', the 9th Januaiy 1932, To His Highness Saiyid Said bin Tairaur, Sultan of Muscat and ’Oman, His Highness, I have the honour to inform Your Highness that your father, Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal, at the conclusion of an interview which I had with him at Karachi, addressed to me a letter in which he announced his unwillingness to return to Muscat for reasons of health and his determination to abdicate from the Throne and informed me that he had nominated Your Highness to succeed him and to exercise all powers as Huler of the State, I have communicated the text of this letter to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, who in accordance with the wishes expressed in your father’s letter, have authorised me to inform you that they recognise Your High ness officially as Sultan of Muscat and ’Oman, In conclusion permit me of Your Highness* kindness to express my very sincere wishes that Your Highness may have a long and prosperous reign, and to renew our friendly relations.

Copy of this minute to Luscat La (Jr '‘A * 7 SEEN Political committee. 2 2 MAR 1952 FOR INFORMATION. It will be remembered that the question of the renewal of the subsidies to the new Sultan has not yet been discussed, but an advance copy of Colonel Biscoe’s despatch to the Government cf India is now submitted. (a) The Zanzibar Subsidy of Rs.86,400 per annum. It has always been the view in recent years that this subsidy was absolute and paragraphs 3-4 reiterate this view.. It is subject only to the Sultan’s 'living in terms of amity and friendship with His Majesty’s Government and fulfilling his treaty engagements”. (b) The Arr-e Traffic Subsidy; of Rs.l lakh. The Government of India have promised to consult us before taking a decision (P.Z.7077/31'|f This subsidy is now, strictly speaking, an anachronism, and was only granted to Sultan Taimur 7Government of India remarked in their letter of the 14th April, 1921, to the Political Resident (P. 4180/21) that it seemed open to the Government of India 'to reconsider the position and to treat the question of withdrawal or curtailment as one of expediency m the light of the circumstances then prevailing.” Colonel Biscoe now suggests that the financial situation of the State requires its renewal for at least _three years, with the possibility of a further extension of I two years. A study of the budget figures for 1932 confirms this and it seems probable that the Government of India, hard I up though they themselves are, will support his recommendation. The estimated receipts are about 7 lakhs: to take away 1 lakh, just when Saiyid Said and Captain Alban have nut the State finances on the road to stability would be disastrous. It will be observed that not only did the actuals for 1931 balance, as anticipated in the papers submitted at P.Z. 5848/31 (on attached file), but there was a surplus of about Rs.30,000 to be devoted to repayment of the Government of India loan* it seems probable,' however, that this represents the repayment of Rs43,000 to the Government of India included in the budget estimate for 1931 (page 5 of P.Z. 5848/31) - so Iff. that in effect the actuals fall short of the estimates by Rs.13,000. There remain about 2 lakhs of debts altogether , including the whole debt to the Government of India. The 1932 estimate shows a surplus of Rs. 1,300 l'ithout including the increased customs revenue which it is hoped to gam from the action at Sur and the revision of the Commercial Treaty. There is apparently the nosSibility of t' n '&gt; ;/X' ‘ frit ^ faA* , y A* ntf/tt )Minute Paper. POLITICAL Department. In these circumstances it would certainly seem advisable not to cripple Captain Alban in the completion of his excellent work by the withdrawal of l/7th of the receipts. The time for its withdrawal is when in a few years the State has become completely self-supporting. The present expense would be amply repaid by the influence it would give us with a firmly seated Ruler. A.F. MO RLEY. 2. 3.32. It should be noted that the estimated surplus of Rs. 1,800 is irrespective of the 2 lakhs of outstanding debt. It is hoped to pay off about Rs.74,000 of this debt in 1932-3 (and the remainder in 1933-4). The State is therefore banking on a surplus of over Rs. 70,000 over the estimated receipts. This makes it even more obvious that it would be a mis take at this stage to withdraw the Arms Subsidy.■”1 \ 1 ? ^ ^ I v! 7 7 ; COKFID-L^TIAL. ) HO.70-S of 1932. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, the 12th February 1932. From To The Hon* ble Lt.Colonel K.V.Biscoe,I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Foreign secretary to the Government of India, fd axt 1 / a*) Vk 4 Sir, fith reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram Jsio.T.ll, dated the 8th January 1932, I have the honour to address the Government of India regarding the subsidies which are at present paid to the Muscat State. 2. These subsidies are two in number, the ^Zanzibar” subsidy of Rs.86,400, and the Arms Traffic of Rs.1,00,000 per annum, ami the question of their continuance arises in connec tion with the abdication of Saiyid Taimur and the accession of his son Saiyid Said. 3* As regards the former subsidy there would seem to be no doubt that it is an absolute subsidy, conditional only on the new Ruler promising friendship and the naintenance of his treaty obligations. This subsidy was granted to the Sultan of Muscat under Lord Canning* s Award of 1861 as compensation for tne abandonment of his claims over Zanzibar, and was originally payable by the Sultan of Zanzibar. Owing however to constant delays in payment by the .latter ruler responsibility for its payment was assumed in 1873 by the Government of India so long as the Sultan ’•continued faithfully to fulfil his treaty engagements ...engagements and manifest hit) friendship towards the British Jovernment*, the cost being divided equally between the British and Indian Oovernments. In Larimer volume 1 page 500 it is pointed out that in the discussions which took place in ld6B«»70 between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India the t former impugned and the latter maintained the indefeasible right of the Bultan of 'Oman to a subsidy under Uie Award of 1&amp;61, and that no definite conclusion was reached* Therefore the subsidy, of which payment to T*rki began in 1873, may be regarded either as a new subsidy or a continuation of that decreed by Lord Canning, but the latter view, which was supported by the Govern* ment of India, appears to be the jus ter, and having regard to the origin of the payment would seem to be correct* The subsidy was at that time converted into rupees and paid at the rate of Hs*86,400 a year* From 1st September 1833 the date on which His Majesty's Government assumed the exclusive direction of ;&lt;f»n£ibar affairs the subsidy became an exclusively Indian charge* On the accession of laiyid Faisal payment of the subsidy was continued to him, but owing to his unsatisfactory behaviour was suspended from the beginning of Jeoember 1393, but in October 1900 the Government of India eventually decided to liquidate all their claims against the Sultan from the accumulated arrears of the subsidy, and a small balance was paid to the Sultan* 4* On the death of Saiyid Taimur confusion seems to have arisen regarding th&amp; two subsidies, and they were discussed as though they were on the same basis, which is not the case, and owing to the .Mzlte&amp;r subsidy being linked with that of the Arms Traffic subsidy the Government of India did not treat it as an absolute subsidy, but sanctioned, its continuance only on condition that the Sultan agreed to the postponement of the revision of the Muscat • • •-3- i (71 ) !&gt;■ Ko«ee.t Comaercia 1 treaty - vide froreign arid i’olitioal iieiiart- ment telegraa Eo.33.67 of 20th January 1914, and also 33.76, dated 26th January 1914. In 1921 however, la considering the itueetion of Uie reduction of the hrms Traffic eubeidy, tne Political Agent, ausoat, expreaeea the view that the ^anaiuar euosldy was, subject to certain not very clear conditions, the right of any Sultan reocgnioed by the iiritieh CJovtmiaent - a view which was concurred in by the Hesident, vide .usn-tre letter Ho. 138-3 of 13th June 1931, and it uay be assumed that the Government of India also concurred as they instructed the Hesioent to explain to the hultan the terms of both the iansitoar and the A r sis Traffic subsidy - vide thoir Memorandum ho. 1343- i.A., dated 29th jeeeiaber 1921. .hether any oommunloation was i»de to the Sultan at Uis time my records do not show, but presumably some verbal intimation at any rate was given to hie Highness, since in his letter ho.32-:&gt;, dated 22nd :*epteiaber, which formed an enclosure to Bushire letter ho.790-3 of 22nd ~x October 1JX2, th« a ox it i cal Ajietit reported tixat the ,»ultan had diecueaed with him the nature of the Arxaa Irafiio subsidy. Ko lurther reference however is made in any correspond one e ol the .oansibnr subsidy and X think it will be seen fraa the above brief sumiaary of the history of this subsidy that the Government of India have accepted the view that it is an absolute eubeidy granted to the Sultan of Unseat subject only to his living in terms of asaity and friendship with His Majesty’s Government and fulfilling his treaty engagements. 3. The Arms Traffic subsidy is however on a totally difierent basis. It ms originally granted to only id Taimur in 1912 in return for an undertaking on his i*rt,to establish a bonded warehouse in whi oh anas and am unit ion &gt;/o 1, - e deposited on importation. On the death of ^aiyia raisal the / n\ ...4 4 the following year it was decided to continue the subsidy to Salyid Taimur on certain condltions t but, as explained abore, some confusion arose owing to the two subsidies haring been treated as though they were on the same basis, although one was a permanent subsidy and the other a personal one. 6. In 1921 the Government of India considered the question of the reduction of the Arms Traffic subsidy and Salyid Taimur appears to h&amp;re argued th t since they were both continued on the same terms the Arms Traffic subsidy was also an absolute one. The Government of India however (vide Foreign and Political Department letter 126d/15l(2)&lt;*»£xt., dated 7th December 1922) decided that It was personal to Daly id Faisal and that it was only continued to oalyid Taimur as a favour, and in 1923 the then Political Resident,Colonel Knox, Informed Salyld T&amp;imur to this effect in a personal letter, and I think it Is quite clear that, while the Muscat State can claim the continuance of the ^ansib&amp;r subsidy as a right so long as they live on terms of amity with His Majesty's Govern* ment, they cannot claim any continuance of the Arms Traffic subsidy. I have perhaps discussed this matter at unnecessary length, but as a good deal of confusion regarding these two subsidies seems to have arisen in the past 1 have thought it desirable to emphasise the distinction. 7. The Government of India and His Majesty's Government, however, are interested in the stability of the Muscat finances. For many years past the f inunces of the Gtate have been under the management of a European Adviser and the Government of India have granted it loans. During, the past year the 4uscat State, like almost every other State, has been passing through a period of acute financial difficulty; despite this however during the past 12 months special efforts have been made to put the finances of the State in order by reducing expenditure and ! increasing* increasing rovenuaa#and despite the adverse circumstances they have met with a very large measure of euaceae* i am hopefv^JL that with the accession of a young and energetic and relatively well*educated ruler there will be a steady iiaproveiaent* Unfortunately» however, the resources of the 3tate are slender, and for the next few years at any rate the management of the finances will need great care and the exercise of the strictest economy. 3* In order that the Gov^naent of India and His Majesty’s Government might be apprised of the financial position of the State, 1 a meed Colonel ifowle to 1st me have a statement showing ,/the State’s liabilities anti the budget for the current year, • ^ I forward herewith a copy of the Political Agent*s iseaorandua enclosing the budget. It will be se^n that the last year closed with a balance of about Rs«3O,Q0O, which 1 understand has been devoted chiefly to the repayment of the Government of India loan. His Highness the Sultan is most anxious to liquidate this loan as soon as possible, as, unliice the State’s other liabilities, it bears interest. His Highness hopes to pay it off entirely during the current year. There will then only remain the debts to local merchants, the chief being the son of the late Khan Bahadur Mohamaed Haeib, I suggested to His Highness that a committee should be appointed to investigate these claims and I hope they will be susceptible of reduction, 9, It will be seen from the budget for the current year that ignoring the debts the receipts are estimated at Ks,7,02,100 while the expenditure comes to .b, 6,76,500, leaving a balance of Rs,25,300, ho provision has been isade in the expenditure for the Kx~ »ultan*s alloauiice of ne*24,000 per annum, and If this is taken into account there is only left a oargin of he, 1,300, Further, His Highness* personalall ovmracfcf has bean fixed at as. 6,000 per ftwaatm, and be informed me that Mill© during the preeeut oriels he was willing to try and manage on this sum. It was really quite inadequate if he was in any way to maintain hie position as ruler of the 6tate« ilth thie view I am in agreements apart from the neoeeeary domestic expenditure, there are maqy ealle upon the puree of an Arab ruler, and if we are to build up, as X hope we shall in course of time succeed in doing, the personal influence and authority of the ruler of i uscat, it is desirable that be should be able suitably to reoeire anu entertain Shaikhs from the interior who come and visit him. I would mention that Shaikh lltumd of Bahrain receives from various sources about Rs» 1,60,000 per annum, and he infortsmd ms on the occasion of recent visit that this sum was quite in adequate, and that he did not know how to imuce both ends meet* dh&amp;ikh Haaad, 1 admit, is not a particularly happy example to quote, for he has little idea of the value of money and woul&lt; at probably be always hard up whatever his income was, but/any rate it will be seen that the privy puree at Muscat is now- a-days less than half that of the i£uler of Bahrain* 10* Steps have already been taken to reduce the family allowances, the only two exceptions b«i.i% the al owanoes drawn by tfalyld Nadir and 3aiyid Thyiab* Saiyid Taimur roads a special request to Saiyid Said that these allowances should not be reduced and naturally daiyld Uaid does not wish so early in his reign to ignore his father 1 s .wishes or to antagonise his Influential uncle* Apart from this 1 do not think the budget calls for more detailed comments than it has received in Colonel Towle's memorandum* XI* I am hopeful that it umy be possible to enhance the customs tariff during the current year; if so it should be • • •0 7 i&lt;fS ba poasibla to obtain increased r#venue frm ouetome, and further # the action which we are now taking at Aiqa should finally settle once and for all the difficulties hitherto experienced at 3ur t and port* Eot only that but it ehould have a eatiefaoto y reper- cusaion ^rou^hout the State and ehould facilitate collection of revenue at Sohar and eleewhere* It will be oUear* however, from the budget that if the Arms Traii ic sabaidy of one lakh la withdrawn ismaediately there la no poaaibilit^ of the State being able to balance ita budget, and it sauet again alnk into ita former condition of insolvency ana debt. Given, however, eupport on the ooaet in the saainten&amp;nce of ita authority and fl ancial aaaiatanoe in the form of a continuance of the subsidy for a few yeare more, until it has liquidated ita liabilities and finally re-organised ita finances, I share the view expressed by the Political /gent that it ehould then oc able, with the return of more normal commercial conditions, to bs entirely self-supporting. I would therefore urge that as an act of grace the Government of India should agret to continue the subsidy for a further period of three years in the first instance. It is difficult to fcare- cast the future, and it seems not improbable that it will be necessary to maintain the subsidy for five years, but if the tariff rates are enhanced ana trade improves and the authority or the State is firmly established along t e coast it is possible that three years may suffice* I would therefore ask that it should be extended for three years in the first instanoe with a proviso that the matter should be re-examined at the end of this period in the light of the circuoatanoea then prevailing. I regret the delay that has occurred in the submission of this report but as ihe Government of India are aware, 1 have been almost enable a more effective control to be exercised at that important continuously •••r r-\ continuour&gt;ly on tho move for the last two iaontha.

To The Hon’tle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire » Memorandum . jfith reference to your request for a report on the subject of the finances of the State, I submit the following memorandum. THE YEAR'S FORKING . 2 . The monthly financial statements which were initiated by the Muscat State at my request show clearly the financial progress of the State, and reflect credit on Saiyid Said and his Accountant General, Rai Sahib Dull Ghana. The last statement submitted i.e. for the month of November ( vide my memorandum No. 14-13 of 7th December 1931) shows a balance up &gt; to date on the working of the last 11 months of receipts over expenditure of Rs. 30,456. Saiyid Said informs me that at the end of the present month, which is also the end of the financial year, the State should finish up with a similar credit. BUDGET FOR 19 32 . 3. With regard to the Budget for 1932. This will be affected by various factors on which it is practically Impossible to prophesy i.e. rise or fall in the world price of commodities, principally - as concerning Muscat - of rice, sugar,coffee and piece-goods, Imports, and dates and fish: Exports; fluctuations in the price of silver which affects the dollar; the imposition of the new tariff rates if sanctionedby America and France; and so forth. RECEIP TS. 4. I attach a Budget which Saiyid Said has had made out, The most important single item on the Receipts side is the Arms Subsidy of Rs. 1,00*,000. As you are aware this is in danger of being stopped by the Indian Government. I have already express- ed my views as to the serious effect on the State finances if this stoppage is actually made and I need not labour the point any further. The other anticipated receipts appear to be based on a conservative estimate. EXPEIIEIT TIRE . 5. 1. Civil List . 1931 Rs.2,66,500. 1932 Rs.2,36,500, i.e. a reduction of Rs.30,000. The estimate for 1932 includes Rs.6,000 p.m. for Saiyid Said as Sultan, but not the Rs.2,000 p.m. as allowance to his father. Rs.6,000 is Rs.4,000 less than was drawn by his father, but Saiyid Said says he will endeavour to carry on with this until the financial condition of the State improves. For 1932 reductions have been made in the allowances of the Royal Family of 2%,3$ and 5% according to salary. The Civil List is still very large, and the fact that Saiyid Nadir, for instance, one of Saiyid Said’s uncles, will still receive more than Rs.2,000 p.m. for doing nothing, seems anomalous considering the financial condition of the State The Civil List,however, always bulks large in Oriental Govern ments: Saiyid Said has initiated reductions, and I dare say will follow them up with others in future years when he is firmly seated in the saddle. 6 . 2. General Administration . 1931*sRs. 150,000. 1932 Rs.138,140 i.e. a reduction of Rs.11,860. This reduction has been effected by cuts in pay all round. This is an ’’omnibus” heading and includes a variety of items which might-3- in future years be split up, Askeries for instance being made a sub-heading of Defence. I do not suggest, however, that we worry Saiyid Said on the point now# 7. 3. Customs and Revenue . 1931 Rs.75,000# 1932 Rs.87,500 i.e. an increase of Rs.12,500. In 1931 customs contingencies Rs.SgiOOO, and customs Weighing Fees R8.3,000, were included under* Miscellaneous (Item 10). In 1932 these expenses have been shown under this head. This accounts for Rs. 8,000 of the increase. In addition Rs.12,000 Landing Charges, shewn separately in 1931, are shown in 1932 under this heading,i.e. a total of Rs.20,000. The increase being only Rs.12,500 a aaving of Rs.7,500 has been effected by a cut in salary of those drawing over Rs. 50 p.m. on a sliding scale of 3/», 5% and 10 /S. 8 . 4. Marine i.e.The State Gunboat H Al Saidi*: 1931 Rs.30,000. 1932 Rs.21,000,i.e. a reduction of Rs.9,000, which has Bjsfc been effected by cutting down of personnel and reduction in estimate of coal required. 9* Defence.(Muscat Infantty) . 1931 Rs.94,600. 1932 Rs.98,000,i.e. an increase of Rs.3,400. This includes a Commandant and a full strength of 150 men. The full pay of the Commandant has been shown against this heading. As he will also be Financial Advieer a moiety of this might be debited against General Administration (Item 2). The question of the Muscat Infantry has been exhaustively dealt with in many despatches. The latest are my Bushire letters to the Govern ment of India lTo.487-S of 1st August 1931, and No,638-S ot 2nc October 19 31. The question still to be decided is whether the basic pay should be further reduced to Rs.20, and the ration increased (vide my telegram No.277 of 1st December 1931). Saiyidn Saiyid Said, as will be seen, is prepared in his Budget to carry on the present pay, and pending discussion with you I have said nothing to him about the possibility of a further cut. 10* Public \7orks . 1931 Rs.5,000. 1932 Rs.25,600, i.e. an increase of Rs.20,000. In 1931 the salaries of this depart ment were included under General Administration. In 1932 they have been brought under this heading. Money is badly required for the up-keep of the present Muscat-Matrah road and for extension of the proposed roads to Sahar and Sur 0 Forts are an important item and have to be kept in repaid, and a new Customs house has been built at Sur. 11. 7. Education . 1931 Rs.16,000, 1932 Rs.14,600, i.e. a reduction of Rs.1,400. I think some economies might be made under this heading. Education and books etc. are free and small school fees might be levied. The terms of the teachers too, which include a 4 months leave every year on full pay with travelling expenses to and from Palestine, which is their home, are rather extravagant* Their contracts are up in May and Saiyid Said informs me that new contracts will be made, possibly 1 | with schoolmasters from ’Iraq on less expensive lines. I , suggested to him that while free education might be given in the lower classes, in the upper ones fee might be charged. He seemed ■^o welcome the suggestion. 12. 8 . Quarantine . 1931 Rs.2,400, 1932 Rs.7,000,i.e. an increase of Rs.4,600. This is due to repairs of Quarantine Station and an increase in staff. It is proposed to put a Quarantine Doctor at Gwadur where at present there are no medical arrangements. This fund is raised by the payment of Rs .5 taken on every passenger disembarking at Muscat. The fund is ear-marked for Quarantine purposes, up-keep of Quarantine Station, payment of • • •-5- of Quarantine Medical Officer, etc* and cannot be used for other purposes* 13. 9. Pensions* 1931 Rs.9,000, 1932 Rs.10,000. This is a fund which members of the A1 Bu Said tribe are paid who have done service for the State. a reduction of Rs.12,500. In 1931 a total of Rs.8,000 was shown against this heading. In 1932 this sum has been charged against Customs ( see item 3). In 1931 Rs.5,500 for Ceremonies, Ides and Missions, were shown under this heading. In 19 32 this has been put under General Administration (Council of Ministers). Tuis gives an actual increase under this heading of Rs. 1,000. 15. 11. Sohar * 1931 Rs.33,900, 1932 Rs.20,400,1.6. decrease of Rs.13,500. This district has only been recently brought under effective control, as previously Saiyid*Said f s uncle, whom he deposed last spring from the Waliship, exercised quasi-independent rule there, maintained an extravagant administration and remitted very little to the Muscat Treasury. An appreciable reduction has been made in the estimated expenditure. 16. 12. Debts . A list of debts which the State will owe on the 31st of the month is attached. Items 5 and 7 are due to Government. If conditions are favourable Saiyid Said infoms me that the former will be paid off in the first half of 1932 and the latter during the course of the year. will be paid, off during 1932, and the balance - if conditions are favourable - in 1933-34. It will be noted that item 2 is creditable to K.B.Nassib &amp; Son, as Saiyid Said informs me that this amount has probably been paid by Rassib &amp; Son to the Sultan for whom they acted as a sort of private banker. In any case this is a matter for adjustment between the State and N a ssib &amp; Son, or the Sultan. Items 1-4 are due to merchants. About Rs.5,000 of this Item 6 J • • •fu s Item 6. The State will endeavour to pay this off during the course of 1932. 17. To sum up . The balance on the year's working will be about Rs.30,000(para 2). Outstanding debts will come to about 2 lakhs (para 16). Those due to Crovernment will be paid off in the course of 1932, and those due to merchants in 1933-34. If conditions are reasonably favourable the State should be completely solvent by the beginning of 1935 (para 16). The Budget for 1932 will be affected by various factors on which it is impossible to prophesy (para 3). On the Receipts side the most important individual item is the Arms Subsidy. The receipts generally, as far as I can judge, seem to be based on a conservative estimate (para 4). The total expenditure for 1931 will be about Rs.705,660. This includes various cuts which were made in the course of the year. The expenditure for 1932 is estimated to be Rs.676,300 (deducting the debts) i.e. reduction of Rs.29,360, which has been effected by various further cuts in pay all round. The most important item from our poifct of view is Ho. 5,Defence (Muscat Infantry), and the point has bo be settled whether the basic pay should be further reduced at Rs.20 p.m. (para 9). Some of the items, (for instance No.13 - Pensions - which as far as I can make out is restricted to members of the A1 Bu Said tribe, i.e. the one to which the Royal Family belongs) may appear abnormal from a Western point of view. But we are not dealing with a part of British India, we are not even dealing with an Indian State, our concern is with an independent Arabian Sultanate whose stability for various reasons, political and strategical, is important to us, but in whose affairs we want to interfere as little as possible, provided that this stability is assured. This being so, subject to any remarks that Captain Alban, the new Financial Adviser, has toto make, I think we may give the Budget, which seems to be the best possible under present circumstances, and which reflects credit on Saiyid Said and his Accountant General, our approval. sd/- T.G.Fowle, Maj or, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M.’s Consul,. from CQByiDSNTlAL, Th* Baputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department # To The Hon’ble Lieutenant Colonel H.V.

He has always shown himself an agreeable but effete and indolent ruler and since 1920 has expressed at intervals a desire to abdicate. This has not been allowed - although in fact the Sultan has been mainly an absentee ruler - mainly because of the lack of a suitable successor and because the State could not afford to pay him a pension. He has recently renewed his request to be allowed to abdicate on the alleged ground of ill- health and all efforts to deter him having been unsuccessful, inasmuch as his son is now 22 years of age and displays considerable promise, His Majesty's Government have decided to accept his abdication. He is, however, to be allowed a pension of no more than Rs.2000 per mensem, but this does not apparently affect him/him, since he is content to live quite simply.

I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.P.Z.7683/31 of the 22nd Decemher in regard to the abdication of the Sultan of Muscat and the succession of Saiyid Said as Sultan. 2. The Secretary of State concurs generally in the terms of the draft telegram to the Government of India, enclosed therein. In order, however, to avoid possible difficulties after recognition has been accorded to the new Sultan, I am to suggest, for Secretary Sir S.Hoare^ consideration, the desirability of adding, when approving the procedure proposed, that His Majesty f s Government presume that recognition will not be accorded before the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has satisfied himself that Saiyid Said is willing to write a satisfactory letter, assuming the obligations undertaken by his father. 3. Sir John Simon presumes that the question of the renewal of the subsidies to the Sultan, and the conditions to be attached to their renewal, will be reserved for consideration after recognition has been accorded, as was done on the accession of Sultan Taimur in 1913. In his opinion, however, in order to avoid possible misunderstanding, a passage to this effect might usefully be added to the draft telegram to the Government of/ enclosure in wt-KLy L£ from 7 m m FROM stcRETARy, p 0 &lt;J T ICU L ano SFCRET nE! , 7 _ |N()mof India, who might also he informed that His Majesty’s Government will await their views and those of Colonel Biscoe regarding any additional assurances which it may he desirable to secure. 4. As regards the point dealt with in paragraph 2 and 3 of your letter under reply, the Secretary of State has considered it desirable as a matter of courtesy to inform the French Government, in advance, of His Majesty’s Government’s decision to recognise the new Sultan and I am to enclose a copy of the instructions which he has accordingly addressed to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Paris.

It is however aesirable to oe prepared for all contingencies ana i therefore forward herewith a valuable note by xuirphy regarding the system of succession. I agree with the views therein expressed. I think the misconception is due to the fact that formerly the Imams of Oman were rulers of muscat, and since the Imamate always was ana is elective, the assumption has been made that the Sultanate was also elective; this, however, is not the case, and since its separation from the Imamate no Sultan has ever been elected. This point is brought out oy no rimer. Writing of the changes initiated by ixamad 1784-92 (Gazetteer, Volume 1, page 419) he states ' A tendency towards hereditary sovereignt^^was confirmed under the first rulas of the Al Bu Saidi line' and later describes the regime as co _ §3 one oi ' im P er *‘ e ct heredity'. In nis account of Azzan’s h cji' — C '— £ % ^ reign nowever ne writes tpage ^83) 'Early in his reign o Q a m Azzan seems to have been proclaimed ’Imam* by his priestly ;r supporters* out it aoes not appear that the title, though f -3 o £ j often app-Lied to him, ever receivea the needful ratification of the tribes as a whole'.This view is oorne out oy tae history of Uuscat, for since the death of Imam Ahmad bin Saici, 1783, the last ruler who was also definitely regarded as an Imam, not one of the Sultans of unseat has been elected. It is true tnat Ahmad was succeeded oy Said, who, as iiorimer says, was the last genuine elected Imam of Oman, abdicated trie Sultanate however after a few months in iavour of nis son Hamad, out up to the time of his death wnich did not occur till long afterwards in the reign of Said oin Sultan, he continued to enjoy the title of Imam, which shows that from now on the Imamade and the Sultanate were definitely separated. Up to Hamad’s reign the capital of unseat was Hustaq.i the elected Imams of Oman ruled there and maintained a consfuerabj.e measure of authority over the whole country, muscat being merery the port. Hamad, however, transferred the capital to muscat, and since then the Sultans of muscat have no longer been recognised as Imams ana their authority over the tribes of the interior has steadily declined. It may not oe amiss to record briefly in tabular form the methods of succession in muscat since Imam Ahmad. 1744-83 Imam Ahmad Sleeted Imam. 1783 Said bin Ahmad Sleeted Imam gave up the Sultanate after a few montns, out retained title 1784-^2 Hamad bin Said 1792-1804 Sultan bin Ahmad. 1804-07 radar bin Saif of Imam.

Moreover, the electorate are the tribes in the interior who for years past have defied the authority of tne Sultan, ana do not acknowledge him as their r^ler. We cannot caii on them to elect a new Sultan ana neither can we submit the matter to the votes of the commercial community of muttrah or the petty ohaikhs on the coast. io sum up, r think it has been shown that the Sultanate, as apart from the Imamate, never was elective, and tnat until such time as a ruler arises who establishes his authority in the interior ana assumes the title of Imam we need not consider the question of election. In view of the fact, already reported to Government, that the Sultan aia not in his interview with me reier to the question oi aodicatron, it would not seem necessary at present to consider tne question of tne arrangements to be made when Said comes to the throneMinute Paper. Department. p. 'i. ;&gt;, &gt;h t / The French in 1913 suggested simultaneous recognition (making a reference to the not very relevant declaration of 1862 ^?ages 226-7 of Aitchison, 4th Edition, Vol. XII7)* We did not agree as we had already taken action. The fact that there is not now, as there was then, any French Consul at Muscat is possibly a point in favour of telling the French what we are doing rather than the reverse. the question of Muscat tariff revision from France (and from the U.S.A. but there seems no need to take special steps to inform them regarding the succession). impression that we consider their consent necessary before we recognise the succession, but, in existing circumstances, it might conceivably be thought desirable to inform them as a matter of courtesy before we actually notify the new ruler of our recognition. It is largely a point for the F.O. and it is perhaps, on the v r hole, just worth while to put it to them. It iB important, however, that any step which the F.O.may wish to take should not have the effect of delaying the procedure proposed in paragraph (1) of Colonel Biscoe's telegram over Ramazan.

In tills connection I am to refer to F.O. letters Nos.49298/13 d/31/10/12 and 52291/13 d/20/11/13 and connected correspondence. In any case Sir S. Hoare does not suggest that the French Government i should be asked for their concurrence in the proposal to recognise the new ruler. He considers that this would be undesirable on political grounds and it is moreover a matter of some urgency to issue instructions to Colonel Biscoe in order that the steps contemplated in para. 1 of his telegram of 15th December may be taken before Ramazan.

'xhe GoTeximBUt of India appeared to be under the impression formerly that the tfultan »a» BXeoted t but ^ajor Murphy dealt Bith this tiuestion in a valuable note *iich I foreiirded to them unaer cover of »y deni-official letter ho. 701-8, dated the 51st iueconber 1929, and oiiowed, I think, conclusively tJmt idiile the laawate eae elective the aultan had never been elected: vhen the offioee sere combined an election took place, tout the election ea® that of the Uaam and not that of the sultan. Furthermore, in the present condition of the Muscat utute no election is possible. Vhe isultan rules only along the coast, and such authority as exists in the interior is in the hands of the 1mm, and the nhaikhs of the various trlbss. Ihey obviously cannot be asked to elect a Pultun whose authority they do n it acknowledge. 7* a he Cult an u&amp;s appointed as/his successor his son, Baiyid .&gt;aid. r jihe latter is now 22 years old. he has for the last two ye urs acted as President of the Council and has acquired a .practical knowledge of the administration of the Plate. while during the first year he took but little active part in the administration, which was largely in the hands of nr.'rhoaas and the elder members of the Council, during the last 12 months he has very definitely asserted himself. Mr. Thomas has left, two of the former members of the Council have died, and the so-called Council now consists of Halyld said and tth&amp;ikh &amp;uto&amp;lr - a very worthy but quite insignificant individual, who supervises fairly satlsfaotorily the judicial work of the Stats. For some time past therefore the Council has in practice been Balyid ttald: invested with this responsibility ana authority he has, 1 consider, risen very well to the occasion. he has displayed keen interest in the finances of the btate; he has as sert ed * • a •a&amp;aert«d his paraon&amp;l authorit/ o» several oocaaiona* for instance at ttohar ilia uncle*, f aitl iiaaeC, hail been viali icr many years past am had established a virtual autocracy there to the great detriment of the State finances. featyid Said « proceeded there by himself anu transferred his uncle to another place. he has re-established the authority of the state at ftur as reported to the Government of imia in my telegram ho. 650* dated the 29th October 1921, and it remains now only to deal with the (pie at ion of liqa and the jutni hu Ali # and 1 am glad to be able to inform the Government of India that the ”Al Bald' has succeeded in seising one of the Aiqa dhows with out any assistance from Hie U«gesty’s navy. This should have a good effect. ftaiyid a&amp;id was for five years at the uayo College 9 Ajmere, and has therefore got a very much better education than any of his predecessors, and is Jceen and intelligent. amall in stature and rather insignificant to loos at. he appears to possess a somewhat quick temper - not at all a bad thing m an uriental ruler - and tnls will, x think, make him respected by his subjects. He is therefore personally well qualified to aauume the reins of government and - though it is always dangerous '** prophesy in such matters - he should mam a good and energetic ruler* unless the enervating climate in which he is compelled to live takes its toll upon him. 8* X therefore recommend that the Government of India should accord him their recognition as Hullan of unseat in the place or his father. It will however be necessary to maintain some measure of control over the finances of the Htate for many years to come. Vhe ruler will be young and not very experien ced. and has no competent Arab advisers. ihe btate still owes aboutZ 4 -^ about He•f)0 t 000 to the novertuaent of India and has other outstarxlirig debte wm dating to about, tin. ifr iaJchs. 1 hough energetic meaBiuea Ijave been taicen to balance the budget* the State cannot yet be regarded aa solvent and the future ia un certain* and ita financial atability haa aleaya been regarded aa a natter of concern to t^e uovernuent of India* oirUier, the State relies to a large extent on the eupport of the Britiah oove nMent for the naintenanoe of ita authority on the ooaat* and the latter can therefore fairly denam^ that it shall maintain such force as its resources permit of to deal nith minor incidents* and relieve Hia iuge8ty*8 ships of at any rate some of tiie reaponaibllity. In his letter of abdication Bald Taimur writes that he has advised his son to consult the 'tolltlc&amp;l Agent on important matters* I woulc. suggest therefore that if the (lovernaent of India accept the abdication of said taimur and agree to the succeasion of Salyld Said I should be authorised to a cord S&amp;iyld Said fo zmal recognition as sultan of muscat, fhis I would do at a public durbar whieh X consider should be as impoal^ a function as the financial position of the state will permit of* and to which if possible some of the shaikhs from the interior should be invited* At the same time X woold suggest that X should be authorised to write him another letter bringing the above passage in SAid falmur's letter to hie notice and recalling the financial assistance and armed support given to the state in the past and inform him that the Government of India trust that until the finances have been put on a satisfactory footing and the debts liquidated* he will keep the Political Agent generally informed regarding the condition of the finances* and that the strength of the i.evy Corps will not be reduced below the present figure of iiiO* all ranks* and that adequate provision will be made inthe budget to Haintain it in a state of efficiency.

At the beginning of this year a similar situation arose and was dealt with in Colonel 310000*8 despatch Bo. Zl. sp'^l - 26-8 of 12th January to the Foreign secretary to the Govern ment of India with copies to Hie Majesty's Secretary of State for India, certain definite propoeals being made in paragraphs 12 and 13 of that despatch. 3. These proposals were briefly as follows} that the failure of the Sultan to return to Muscat last winter should be condoned,! and that His Majesty's Government should continue to pay the Arms Subsidy,paragraph 7 of Colonel Biseos's despatch^ but that an expression of the dis pleasure of the Government of India should be conveyed to the Sultan at his failure to comply with the conditions t k lmK ^ ^ on which the loan was made to him ( i.e. that he should M hfe. 1*14 «- Job 4 &lt; ^ b /he *w /’■Z.MJl, s f&lt;~ 4 h/m reside . • •P-L '/ftp! pi- !(Jj/j! .

That efforts should be made during the coming summer to induce the dultan to come back to Muscat for the fixed period of 5 months next winter* 4* TTiese proposals were agreed to by the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department ( vide their telegram ho*521~S of 22nd February), and by His S£aJ esty* s Government { vide Secretary of State for India's telegram Ho* 1042 of 24th March to the Government of India, repeated to the Political resident 9 hushire), subject to reservations contained in paragraph 2 of India Office letter dated larch 10th to the foreign Office. In tnis letter the India Office pointed out that the vielt of the Sultan every year to Muscat for a stay there of 3 months was not one of the conditions on which the loan was given in December 19IS. Hie yearly stay in Muscat was one of the conditions imposed in larch 1920 in return for our assistance to him * in the negotiations with the rebels and in the continued re construction of his finances * ( P»G.13,page 4S,paragraphs 35 and 36). It was on this occasion ' also that the Privy Purse was fixed at n«*l© f 0OG» subject to its highness’ continued good behaviour and to the continued ability of the State finances to bear the strain’• In the opinion of the Secretary of State for India it was therefore undesirable to suggest that our power to take action on Colonel Biscoe's proposals was directly connected with the terms of the loan. b* • •(£1V 5# AceordmgXy iio due course the Sultan wae Informed and his allowance reduced to 7*8.5000/- per mensem* 6. Measures were also taken, as suggested by Colonel Biscoe, to try and persuade the uultan to return for the stipulated 5 months to Muscat nsxt winter* ith the approwal of Colonel Biscoe, X took adwantage of the fact that I was recessing at Karachi from Muscat last April-May to hare a meeting with His Highness up-country, at which I used all the arguments I could think of to induce him to agree to return to Muscat next winter. Saiyid Said, His Highness* eldest son, and President of the Council of Ministers, who was at Karachi for a change of air, also Tisited his father with the same object. *he result of our combined 'attack* was that through Saiyid Said, His Highness stated verbally that he would return to Muscat, and on jay informing Colonel Biscoe of this, he reported the matter to the Coveramcnt of India and to the India Office in his Express Letter Ho.256-1 of 12th H*y* unfortunately the aultan h e now again changed his mind. 7* he fellow coamentB occur* to me* 1 think first, it must be accepted that this is the Hultan*s last word and that no further attempt to persim.de him to change hie mind would be of any use* In other words hie abdication will have to be accepted* 8* There are three financial points in oonnection with Xk Mis Highness* abdication which ars of importance* In fact, as Colonel Jiscoe pointed out in paragraph 4 of his despatch !«o*52*T of 12th Movember 1930, if it were not for •«•4 (e 5 for the financial iAplieatlona of Hie Highneeo* abdication hi a departure could be regarded with indifference* fheee three points are as follows*- (a) The i^rms Subsidy} (b) The IriTy T'urse for His Highness 1 successor} and (c) The allowance for His Highness when the latter retires* 9* .fith regard to (a) f which was dealt with in p&amp;ra~ graph 7 of Colonel Biscoe 1 s letter of 12th January already quoted. The Arms Subsidy, as will be seen, is personal to His Highness as long as he holds tenure of power ( Tide for instance telegram &amp;o«3674 of 26th November 1929 from the Secretary of State for India to the uoTtrnment of India, repeated to t ie Political resident, taifcllriA For the present year as Hia Majesty^ Covernmont have condoned His Highness* absence from Sfuscat last winter the State is continuing to draw the subsidy* hen his abdication is finally accepted, however, this subsidy, by the letter of the law, will be lost to the State. The effect of a loss of Hs*1,00,000 per annum on the State in its present financial stress would be disastrous, and I can only echo Colonel Tiscoe’s hope that Government will bo able to temper the wind to the shorn lamb and not wholly rule out the possibility of the continuance of this subsidy for some further limited period. 10* ^ith regard to (b) and (c) which Colonel Biscoe commented on in paragraph 8 of his letter. As for (b), I thinic perhaps, that having regard to the present financial • •/! 6ff£ 'jo. financial condition of the State, that eoiaething lese tiian He# 10,000 per i&amp;enseifl aight suffice* In the ^ubc t budget, for instance, made up by Saiyid Said at a time when the w&gt;uXtan was expected bach at Muscat next winter, the sum of Be*7000/- per iftenseei was allowed a» His iIighnees , allowance for the L period of his stay. fhio or perhaps even lese might suffice for hie successor, 11, As for (c), I think the allowance should be cut down to the loweet figure to enable His Highness to live in reasonable comfort in India. I have no personal prejudice against the , ,1 an; on the contrary, on the two occasions when I have met him he hae irapressed me favourably, and after ay last interview with him last April I wrote to Colonel Biscoe as followsi H I renewed the favourable impression I received in ny interview with him of last year (paragraph 2 of ay latter of bepteaber 8th,1950/. His t .ugliness is decidedly * all there”, and if only he coultrbe induced to taice up the reins of Government would - in my opinion - make a good 3ultaA*' r &gt;ut as far from doing his full duty as a Sultan, he will not even perform the nominal task of residing for 3 months every year in Muscat, he has no claims on our sympathy. His statements as to ill health preventing him spending a few months of the cold weather yearly at Muscat are ridiculous. His real rtc sons are given by Colonel Biscoe in his letter ho*494-5 oi 18th Jepte »ber 193(1, paragraphs 2 and 5, and are briefly that His Highness prefers to lead a life of ease in India on a eaavortable income, supplied by the State, for which he has to do no work. An additional reason may be to avoid the Sultana, his first wife, and mo her of Baiyid Haid, a formidable lady *.•ZT7Z f.Z f?', *1. lady with a tcrapar and tai^peramant of her own. She has made oxie or two attempts to leare Muecet, where she liree, and join him in his 'exile’ but has been hastily prerented from doing so by his express eoiuxoand. If we could make it one of the conditions of his abdication that the Sultana should also ’abdicate’ and live with him permanently, His Highness might again changehis mind, but I am afraid that this is outside the sphere of practical politics. 12. In fixing the Sultan's allowance we must consider his financial commitments. these are detailed in the quotation from a letter of mine given in paragraph 11 of Colonel Blscoe's letter of 12th January and consist of two categories: family expenses and debts to merchants. 1 then recomaended Rs*bOOO ( which was approved of by Colonel lUscoe, paragraph 12 of the same letter), but that was when there were hopes that he would live up to his agreement to return to Muscat* x*he situation we are now considering is that he will no longer be ruler, and in that case, and considering the almost bankrupt condition of the State, I do not see why it should allow him more than about Ks.2000 per mensem, and even this will run up to Rs«24,000 per annua a sum which the State can ill afford to give* Hie Highness’ family expenses, it will be seen from Colonel Biscoe's letter, consist of an allowance to the Sultana, who already gets Ke.600 from the State, and to the son of the Circassian wife. His Highness in india lives entirely as a private .individual, and preserves no sort of itate whatever. ( In fact when I saw him off at the station after our last interview he was clad in ’shorts', smoked a cigar, and had shaved off his beard. It is difficult to • • • •-7- inz to say which would hare shocked his Xbedeh subjects in Muscat most!- the ♦shorts*, the cigar, or the absence of the beard.} This being so he can easily live on Re. 1500 per mensem leaving Rs.500 over for the Sultana, if he likes to continue to give her anything, and for the Circassian's son. As for his debts to merchants they must make what arrangements they can with him. 13. The question of Hie Highness successor is not difficult. Saiyid Said, his eldest son, now about 22 years of age, and President of the Council of Ministers, which carries on the administration of the State in the Sultan's absence, is the obvious choice. He,has for the last two years has been to all intents the Ruler, is capa le and popular with the people, by whom he is looked on as the Heir Apparent. He is a little on the young side, but is of course of full age to become Sultan. u. The questions for consideration would appear to be as follows*- (a) whether uovermaent are prepared to accept His Highness* abdication ? The only alternative would appear to be to condone for another year his absence from Muscat (paragraph 3 above), and so keep him nominally on the throne; (b) whether, in case Government do accept His Highness’ abdication, they are prepared to approve of S&amp;iyid Said as his successor 7 ( paragraph 13 above}.

To Major T.C.Fowle, H.B.M.*b Consul and Political Agent, Muscat. Honoured friend, After best compliments. I hare great pleasure in writing this letter to inform you that at our meetings at Cawnpore in the month of April according to your request for an interview, and in three interviews we had at Cawnpore and from our discussions and conversations there you did understand all that ny mind possessed, and you have said in your telegram of the 28th April from Cawnpore, that the discussions which took place between us reached a conclusion. tfhen you gave me your letter Ho.l K. dated the 22nd April 1931 ( corresponding to Silhaj,1349) written at Karachi, I intended to answer you immediately, but you gave me time to consider the matter and to answer you at my convenience. (2) With regard to the matters which you had been instructed by the Resident in the Persian Gulf to discuss with me verbally and in writing. Please know, that we do not deny the favours rendered by the Government of India to us ...(5) «.. 2- us in the past and which are continuous, and which we expect to be continued in the future to the Muscat State ^ and to iay successor. (3) In regard to the negotiations between Bay self said the Political Agent, Mr. Wingate, at Ambala in the year 1920, regarding my return to Muscat from India and the spending of two or three months there annually# Yes I accepted that temporarily and suffered the inconvenience of journeying to Muscat, which is not hidden from the present Resident and his predecessors. And before the beginning of the last,winter I informed the Resident in my various letters,that I was unable to return for reasons which 1 explained to him in my last answers reasons which prevent me from returning, and fulfilling my duty towards Kingdom and my subjects, for which I am sorry. Kor did I think that correspondence would continue on the subject after my final reply to the Resident and after my giving to him and to my successor full authority for the conduct of the affairs of my State and its interests. (4) I did not refuse finally the invitation of the Resident in my answer to him, but I informed you verbally during your visit to Behra Dun, where we met, that I was ready to meet him at Karachi to discuss matters with him. I regret, however, tb»t he could not meet me at Karachi in November last owing to pressure of work, but I gave him full authority to take decision in important affairs in which lay the advantage of the Muscat State, as alluded to by him in his letter.-3- (5) Regarding th.e Arms Traffic compensatory subsidy for losses suffered in the rerenue of the Muscat State* This depends upon the decision of G-oy eminent to deal with my successor and his Kingdom according to the political negotiations in this important question* (6) About the recent investigations and necessary economy in the finances of Muscat, I think that economy has been observed practically in the financial department according to your instructions without any objection from us* (7) Regarding the question of reduction in my personal i allowance to five thousand rupees, I do not require a large allowance for myself as I shall remain out of Muscat, and do not wish to burden my State with losses* (8) I tried my best in considering this matter to force myself to return to Muscat, and to execute my duty in its affairs for the welfare of my State, but I regret I could not bring myself to do so in consequence of the maladies from which I suffer. This prevents my return, and supports my intention of abdicating from the throne of Muscat. I really feel the debility my body suffers from,which is evident. A healthy body is essential for carrying out the management of affairs. (9) At present the administration of our State is going on most satisfactorily. My successor as President of the Council of Ministers has full power to do the best for the benefit of both sides ( the British Government and the Muscat State; and for the welfare of Muscat subjects, after • * * *after taking the advice, in important matters, of the Political Agent in Muscat and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, (10) I trust always in our friend the Government for their friendly attention and favours and pray God to perpetuate the friendship between both aides ( i.e, the British Government and the Muscat State). sd/- Taimoor bin Paisal.

It will, however, be desirable to indicate to the Resident that, for the reasons set out in the minutes on P.Z. 581/31, it will be preferable that in informing the Sultan that his allowance will be reduced to Rs.5,000 per mensem, we should avoid suggesting that our power to make this reduction is directly derived from the terms of the loan financial condition of the State is very much worse than The Government of India support the proposalsof 1919-20. 4* ' A draft letter is submitted for consideration.: Mu ft4793b 5000 10.30 Draft Paper.

INDIA OFFICE t 4 10 MAR 1931 Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the correspondence noted in the margin, of which copies have already been sent to the Foreign Office, on the subject of the desire of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to abdicate and the action recommended in connection therewith by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It will be seen that the Government of India favour the grant of authority to the Resident to take the action proposed in paragraphs 12 and 13 of Bushire despatch No. 26-S of 12th January. The Secretary of State is in general agreement with the views of the Resident and the Government of India and, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he propos es to approve their recommendation. On a minor point he would, however, remark that the reference in paragraph 12 of the Resident's despatch to M the conditions on which the loan was made to him' appears to be based on a slight misunderstanding/I misunderstanding as to the actual position. The history of the loan of 1919-20 is set out in paragraphs 28-31 of the India Office Memorandiim on Muscat reprinted in P.G. 13. The conditions specified are set out in paragraph 29. They include' V U 'fixation of amount of Privy Purse and at the Sultan’s request the Privy Purse was in fact fixed at Rs.10,000. The conditions that he should reside in Muscat for at least three months a year and that the Privy Purse should be definitely fixed at Bs.10,000 per mensem, subject to His Highness's continued good behaviour and the continued ability of the State finances to bear the strain, were imposed in March 1920 as a term of the grant jof our assistance to him 'in the negotiations with the rebels ( of the interior) and in the continued reconstruction of his finances”. While in the Secretary of State’s view His Majesty’s Government are clearly entitled bo take action o] the lines recommended by the Resident, it will, in the circumstances described above, be undesirable to suggest that our power to do so is directly connected with/ )nDraft Paper Department, 47!)3b 5000 10.30 with the terms of the loan made t o the Sultan in 1919-20, and he proposes to inform the Government of India accordingly in approving their present recommendations. 3 % In view of the urgency of the matter, I am to ask for the favour of a very early reply.

I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with rry telegram No.T -6 dated the 23rd January 1931, regarding the finances of the ?. f uscat State. 2. When writing ny despatch No.l-T of 17th January 1931, I was of opinion that with the suspension of the instalment 0 ^ the Government of India loan the receipts aid expenditure 'of the Muscat State during the year 1930 would approximately balance, and that the tariff increases which the State contemdated would prove adequate, combined with the various other measures under contemplation such as the reduction in the pay of the Financial Adviser, etc., to enable the State to pay its way. This opinion was based on figures supplied to me by the then Financial Adviser. Two days ago however, I received from the Political Agent a copy of a report addressed to him by the new Financial Adviser, which discloses a very different state of affairs, and shows that the information supplied to me in the past was entirely misleading. This report, of which I enclose a copy herewith, has necessitated a reconsideration of my previous recommendations, and I therefore sent my telegram referred to above asking that action on my despatch No.l-T From To Sir,of 17th January 1931 should be suspended. 3. It will be seen from this that the financial position of the State differs materially from what it was represented to be, owing to two causes; firstly, debts have been incurred with local merchants, which have not been disclosed and which apparently have not appeared in the accounts, and secondly, the rate of exchange at which the dollar was calculated was wholy fictitious. Further, as will be seen from Mr.Hedgcock T s report, the accounts appear to have been kept in a most irregular and haphazard fashion, and I enclose an exact copy of the account maintained with Khan Bahadur Nasib, the chief creditor. The account contains not a single date, and, while showing a total indebtedness of Rs. 86 , 000 /- was kept on a loose sheet of paper with no details of any description. If this is a fair sample of the system prevailing, in the Muscat Treasury, it is clear that the most disgraceful laxity has been allowed to prevail, especially having regard to the fact that the State had a highly paid British officer as its financial adviser. ‘ rk * ^ will further be seen from Mr.Hedcock , s report that there was not on the 31st December enough money in the Treasury to pay the salaries of officers. To meet the pressing need for ready money Mr.Hedgcock has aksed the x oli ^icdi. Agent ior authority to obtain a temporary over draft from the Imperial Bank of India of Rs. 50,000/-, and this request I have supported to Government in my telegram No.i-15 of 25th January 1931, and I trust sanction will be accorded to it. It is essential that the State should be able to obtain sufficient funds to pay its way for a month or uwo until Jr .Hedgcock has been able to devise measures to dealI I if .bebnecsus si o. v 3 lo^I dw’?! 10 noxdisoc fp'oaex il e 'j dr^r ai:\r o'f nesa ed iTi bOvjrfsas-iqa^ a^v: ix d’Mv*. rroi' teixrt e:;# 'lo ■v- ■'■ ■ :' v j ■' t 7 r: ’' ; ' 7- t r 0 . f •: it- .

I trust also that early orders will he issued for the reduction of the Sultan T s allowance to Rs.5000 per mensem* This will ea.se the situation for the time being. It has been suggested to the «hp4-apparent by lr .Kedgcock that cuts should be made in the allowance of other members of the royal family. This is a matter in which, I think, it is desirable to proceed somewhat slowly, but if the Sultan ? s allowance is reduced it will considerably strengthen the hands of Saiyid Said in dealing with the other members of the family. 6 . 1Tf hen the position was pointed out to the Council by Mr.Medgcock, they addressed a letter to the Political Agent in which they stated that in their opinion the increases in the customs duties originally proposed would not be adequate and asked that the rates should be raised to 10% on general merchandise and 25% on alcohol and tobacco, but stated that in this matter they would be prepared to be guided by my advice. To this end they have asked me (1) to obtain the consent of His Majesty f s Government to a|r e-vis ion of the first Sentence of Article 6 of the treaty of 1891 to read as follows:- M His Highness the Sultan shall be permitted, subject to his treaty obligations to other foreign powers, to levy a duty of entry not exceeding 10 % on general merchandize and 25% on alcohol and tobacco, on the value of all goods and merchandise of whatever description, importedimported by sea from foreign countries into His Highness' dominions'. (2) to obtain the consent of His -Majesty's Government to the introduction of the increased customs rates in anticipation of the formal ratification of the suggested amendment of the treaty of 1891. Th® Political Agent, in forwarding this proposal, points out that goods imported in French and American vessels would still only pay % until the treaties with those Powers hc'.a been amended, but as no French or American steamers call at Muscat, in practice no preference would be given to French or American goods. The proposal however is somewhat similar to that contained in paragraph 5 of India Office letter No .P.6567 of 27th November 1929 to the Foreign Office, and was objected to by the Foreign Office for the reasons given in paragraph 3 of their letter No.E-6207/166/91 of 31st January 1930. From a peicnal of those letters, however, it would seem that there was some misapprehension regarding the position of France and the United States. Under its treaties with those Powers, the Muscat State cannot charge more than 5% on goods imported in ships belonging to them; there is nothing however to prevent the State charging any rate of duty which they choose on French or American goods not imported in French or American vessels, and as no French or American vessels call at Muscat nowadays, the goods of those countries would not obtain any preferential rates. £. Further, the situation vis-a-vis these two Powers has since developed considerably, and they have both expressed their willingness to agree to an increase in the customs tariff. Moreover in his telegram No.237 (R), dated the 16th JuneJune 1930 (of which a copy was forwarded to me under foreign and Political Department endorsement No.D.3444/N-30 of 30th July 1930), His ^jesty’s Ambassador at Washington reported that the Under Secretary had written semi-officially stating tha.t, in the event of limited non-discriminatory increases being made in duties on goods imported into Muscat, pending the conclusion of a new treaty with the United States, tie State Department would probably not have occasion to protest. 9. Further, the French Government have agreed to the modPification to Article 10 of the Treaty of 1844 between France and Muscat - vide note addressed by the Ministry for foreign Affairs tothe British Embassy (copy of which was forwarded to me under F 0 reign and Political endorsement No.F.225-N/29 of 10th December 1930). JO. I trust therefore that His ^jesty's Government will be willing: to agree to a modification of Article 6 of the Treaty of 1891, in the sense desired by the Muscat State, or to go even further and grant to the Muscat State full tariff autonomy, subject to most favoured nation treatment for British goods. The British Treaty would then be in harmony with the French and American treaties. 11. If the revision of the three treaties can be arranged at a very early date, say within a couple of months, then it is probably not worth while authorising the State to raise its duties in anticipation, but if there is likely to be a long delay, then I would urge that the State should be authorised to raise its tariff without having to wait till the negotiationsM lot negotiations have been completed, on goods other than those imported in French or American ships. 12. The new situation which has been disclosed, and the desire which the Muscat State have now expressed to increase their customs duty to a larger extent than was originally contemplated have shown that it is necessary to obtain from the French Government full tariff autonomy for the St&amp;te and not merely permission to increase their customs duties by a fixed amount. I trust therefore, it will be possible to obtain their acquiescence to a revision in the sense of draft (b) forwarded with ray despatch No.l-T of the 17th January 1931. 13. As regards the rates which the Muscat State now contemplate I would prefer to defer a definite opinion regarding their suitability until I have had an opportunity of visiting Muscat* I propose, if possible, to proceed there at a very early date, and willjbhen address the Government of India further on the subject. 14. To sum up: There is no doubt that a serious situation has now been Disclosed, and it is essential that prompt measures should be taken to deal with it, I therefore recommend (1) that the State should be assisted to obtain an overdraft of half a lakh from the Imperial Bank of India to meet immediate requirements. (2) Orders should be issued without delay for the reduction of the Sultan*s allowance to Bs.5000. (3) that His Majesty’s Government should agree to revise Article 6 of the Treaty of 1891 so as to grant the Muscat State full tariff autonomy provided most favoured nation treatment is accorded to British goods. (4)4 (4) that the French Government should similarly be asked to grant to the Muscat State full tariff autonomy in return for most favoured nation treatment, and (5) unless the modifications of the treaties can be effected in the very near future, the State should be allowed to increase the rates in anti cipation of the revision of the British treaty, on all goods other than those imported in French or American vessels, or as it is put in their draft 'subject to their treaty obligations to other foreign Powers'. 51 . Finally, I would mention that Mr.Thomas dis appeared into the Ruba-a1-Khali on the 10th December and has not been heard of since. The Political Agent is making enquiries regarding him, but it is of course very difficult to get in touch with him. I have refrained from detailed comment on his conduct and administration of the finances until he has had an opportunity of offering an explanation, but it seems evident that he has allowed the greatest laxity to prevail and has mislead the British authorities who naturally assumed that the figures he suppled were correct, and showed accurately the financial position of the State. 16.

The real position was less satisfactory than these figures indicate. There were on 31.12.29 undisclosed outstand ing State liabilities to local merchants and others of approximately Rs.75,000; the exact amount cannot be ascertained, as under the existing system of accounts dates are not always inserted. These outstandings first began to accumulate in February 1928. In addition, the sum of Rs.44,645 was due to officials and others on account of pay and allowances for December; the cash in hand to meet these claims amounted to Rs.31,290. The total net State liabilities on 31.12.29 were thus Rs.88,355, approx, exclusive of the Government of India loan. 2) a. The accounts as maintained by the Ministry of Finance give, according to the figures presented to me, the results on last year’s working as below: Receipts Js.9,51,859 Expenditure Rs.9,52,000 Prim facie, the State just about managed to make ends meet last year. The account books, however, are no true guide to the actual position; the explanation is a surprising one, or would be if one’s capacity for surprise were not already exhausted. Revenue paid in dollars and baizas is brought to account at the ” official Treasury rate of exchange” (Rs.l25= / 100). This bears no relation to the current rate of exchanc^, but is, in the words of ny Treasury Officers, 'the rate which was in force when I took up my post two years ago”. Today’s exchange has dropped to Rs.68 =/ 100. The cash balance onon paper thus never corresponds with the actual cash in hand, a. fact which does not disturb ray Treasurer’s equanimity. b. I have had a second set of figures worked out at the average monthly current rate of exchange. These show: The above figures give a more accurate idea of the sums actually received and spent, but they do not reveal that the State's liabilities to local merchants and others had increased by about Rs.41,577 during the course of the year. 3) The State's liabilities on 31.12.30 were as under: (a) Due to local merchants etc. (for details see Appendix A) Rs.1,16,5 (b) Due to officials etc., as pay for December Rs.46,470 2.Cash in hand to meet December pay Rs.29,168 (arrears of revenue are negligible) Net deficit under 4) Of the outstanding liabilities of Rs.1,16,577 mentioned above, Rs.84,145/5/0 is owed to Khan Bahadur Nasib; for details see appendix B. I have had made for retention in this Office a cerafully checked copy of the State's account with Nasib. The original document is attached herewith as a curiosity. It is, as will be observed, a, loose sheet of paper; not a word of explanation appears, nor a single date. Actually the account is made up to the end of November, and the three columns represent rupees, dollars, and baizas. 5) . a. The draft budget for 1931, as submitted to me on arrival and roughly revised by myself, provides as under: Receipts... Expenditure Rs.8,46,174 Rs.8,44,204 EstimatedEstimated receipts ' expenditure... Deficit..' Rs.8,45,000 b. Estimated receipts are based on last year’s actuals. For further particulars see Appendix C. Estimated expenditure is also based on last year’s actual expenditure, and will be found roughly to correspond to the sum of (a) cash actually expended (b) last year’s deficit. (c) the second half-yearly instalment of the Govt, of India loan, for which a oostponement was secured last year. Fuller particulars are given in Appendix D. As M cheese-paring ecomies 1 ’ have been the order of the day fot the past few years, it is difficult to see at a first glance how substantia] savings can be made in expenditure. Adequate increases in revenue can only be achieved by imposing; new taxation. An increase in the customs rate is under active consideration; this question will be made the subject of a separate report. 6) forking to the above budget, the financial position at the close of the present year will be; Deficit on the year’s working ^ (see para.5a above) .... ^et outstanding liabilities (as on 31.12.30 (see para.3.) Total deficit at end of 1931...Rs.* Rs.78,775 --l-.35.879 2.14.654 The above figures do not include the balance of the G 0 vt.of India loan, amounting to Rs.77,841. 7) . It must be emphasised that the system of accounts here makes it impossible to guarantee any of the figures. It may, however, be safely assumed that the State of ^scat's finances is substantially as shown above. 8) . I hope by next week to put up tentative proposals for remedying matters.

The Dollar Exchange. (1) As I find myself at variance with some of the views expressed by my predecessor on the question of the fall in the dollar exchange, I think it advisable to place on record where I differ from him, and my reasons for so differing. It will be sufficient to take two extracts from the correspondence on the subject. (2) ”Had the dollar exchange not fallen there would have been no deficit on the year’s working. This deficit arises rom Customs and zakat taxation having at present to be collected in dollars, e.g. Sur and the Batinah coast. The political situation in both places militates against t^e oax collector insisting on collection in rupees or on the rupee parity. Two dollars today have approximately the rupee value of one dollar this time last year. To demand two dollars this year, as is suggested, on a packet of dates, for instances, where one dollar was demanded last year is in a tribal area where dollars circulate exclusively, to cause discontent and possibly bo invite resistance, for naturally whoever pays customs duties passes them on to the tribesman.” (Para. Ill of No.C32/48 of 20/7/30). In the first place, the argument contained in the latter half of this extract appears to me a specious one. If one dollar customs duty was demanded last year on a package of dates, the customs rate being 5%, the cost of the package works out at / 20. Total cost is thus / 20 plus / 1 duty r Z 21. This year, owing to the fall in the dollar, the customs duty payable is stated to have risen to Z 2 from which it uan be calculated that the dollar value of thethe package of dates is % 40. But as, according to my predecessor, it would caused discontent and possibly armed resistance to demand # 2 where % 1 was demanded last year, the duty remains at 1. That is to say, tha total cost to the merchant of a package of dates is # 40 plus 1 customs duty z ^ 41. It seems to be imagined that though the merchant can pass on the increased dollar cost of the commodity, amounting to # 20, an attempt to pass on the *♦ extra dollar of customs duty may cause the traibesman to resort to his rifle. The above extract was written as an argument against the Political Resident's proposal that customs should be levied at the prevailing rupee rate of exchange. The arguments are redundant, for the simple reason that the duty is, and has been for the past ten years at least, levied at that rate. The truth is that, the duty being both in theory and in practice (as I have ascertained) on an M advalorem ,, basis, the fall in the dollar exchange has had no direct effect on the customs receipts, and is by no means the primary cause of the deficit on the last year's working. The decrease in customs revenue can in the main be attributed to quite a different cause - the fall in world prices. (3) The second extract reads as under 'The interior currency irr Oman being predominantly dollars, the apparent purchasing power of the country has fallen with the price of silver some 18% during the past three months. Whether or no this is the case the State itself with largely a rupee basis for its expenditure side must face losses on exchange' (No.25 of 22/3/30). TheThe purchasing power of the hulk of the inhabitants is made up, not only of silver dollars, hut also of exportable products. Of each tribesman it can in general be said that thispurchasing power is represented by so many sheep, camels, or date palms, and, if hd resembles the Arab of other countries, a comparatively small amount of money. Hence thediminution of his purchasing power due to the fall in the value of the dollar has been relatively small. Thesame may be said of the country as a whole. Oman uses two silver currencies, of which that represented by the rupee has remained constant; further, the drop in the dollar value has been spread over many years, thus enabling merchants to adjust themselves t© a rupee instead of a dollar standard, as many have done. Speaking generally, though individuals may have been hit, ihe country itself has escaped more lightly. There are even indications that the purchasing power of trie country has improved, but these need not be discussed here. The contention that the State 'must face losses on exchange' also need qualification. The State, working on a rupee basis, can make and actually has made a useful profit through the fall in the dollar exchange. Part of the district staff is engaged and paid on a dollar basis; the actual sum involved is 0 29,500 per annum. It has cost the State about half the number of rupee to pay these people this year, as compared with last year. Customs contribute 5£ laks of a total revenue of 8i lakhs. These, being on an ad valorem basis, do not result in any loss on exchange. A subsidy of nearly two lakhs, paid in rupee, similarly occasions no loss.The remaining items are all received in rupees, except zakat (land revenue as distinct from export duty), part of which is repaid in dollars. The amount being so small, the loss on exchange is comparatively insignificant, (4) Though unwilling to go so far as to state that the Treasury has definitely profited by the fall in the dollar exchange, I think that this fall can safely be classified as a minor, not a major calamity.P.Z. 582/31.

To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. Sir, In continuation of my telegram No. T.l, dated the 17th January 1931, I have the honour to forward herewith two alternative drafts amending article 10 of the French treaty of 1844. 2. Draft (a) allows the Muscat State to impose a customs duty of 7£% on all goods except alcoholic liqueurs and tobacco, on which duty may be raised to 15%. Draft (b) allows the Muscat State full tariff autonomy, both in respect of exports and imports, while according to the Frencl^post favoured nation treatment. 3. Under the treaty of 1844 the Muscat State have undertaken not to levy duty exceeding 5% on goods imported in French bottoms, but there is nothing to prevent the Muscat State levying any duty it pleases on French goods imported in vessels that are not French, for instance by British India Steam Navigation Company steamers, provided the British Government do not object under Article 6 of the treaty ofl891.6. 11 * 4. A tariff based on the nationality of the vessel in which the goods are imported instead of on the country of origin of the goods themselves would seem to he of little practical value to the French nowadays, and in the revised drafts I have suggested that this should he altered, and that in future the duty fixed should he applicable to goods of French origin however imported instead of to the cargoes of French vessels. This would seem to he a possible lever to use to the French to induce them to grant the Muscat State full tariff autonomy both in respedt of imports and exports, provided they obtain most favoured nation treatment in return. 5. In the reviseddrafts I have omitted the latter portion of Article 10 of the present treaty which deals with the charges to he levied on vessels as opposed to those which are levied on goods. Ihis is not at present a practical issue since no harbour dues are levied at Muscat and there is only one dhow at Sur nowadays that flies the French colours, so if the French desire that these clauses should he retained, I see no serious objection. They are, however, in my opinion, out of date and not in accord with present day principles or practice, and if at some future occasion the Muscat State desire to levy harbour dues to meet the cost of facilities provided it would seem desirable to obtain for them the power to do so. As long as they obtain the most favoured nation treatment in this respect which the treaty already grants them the French would seem to have little ground for complaint.6. It will be seen that the draft articles are on the analogy of the American draft, but the last sentence of Article i is omitted ineach case, since the French already enjoy most favoured nation treatment in respect of all privileges accorded to other nationals under Article ii of their present treaty. 7. I trust therefore that it will be possible to obtain an agreement of the French Government to an amendment of the treaty on the linesof draft (b) which will certainly be the more advantageous to the Muscat State. Firstly, it would permit of their raising the duties higher Should they desire to do so on some future occasion and secondly, it authorises them to levy export duty. Moreover, although with their somewhat primitive methods of administration a flat rate on all merchandise with the exception of liqueurs and tobacco is probably the most convenient form of tariff for the State, in future years it may be to their advantage to vary the customs duty on different articles, and it is very desirable that they should have power to do so. 8. In view of the present critical condition of the Muscat finances, I trust it will be possible to obtain the consent of the French Government and the United States of America to a revision of their treaties at an early date. 9.

Date. Initials. SUBJECT. To Under Secretary Secretary of State... Committee MUSCAT: . • i Recommendations of Resident as to action to be taken in view of Sultan’s renewed request to be allowed to abdicate, and his failure to return to Muscat. Under Secretary Secretary of State... Copv of to &lt; FOR INFORMATION. UlGi. 'Vt Previous Papers 44.75b 1000 5.30 Please see previous submission on P. 8398/30 below. The Sultan has refused to return to Muscat, and appears to have proceeded on his visit to Ceylon. The Resident is of opinion that it is undesirable m any event that he should abdicate this year, and that it would be preferable that he should remain nominally on the throne for two or three years more. The chief objection to abdication is the financial argument (the arms traffic subsidy of 1 lakh is payable ”so long as the present Sultan of Miscat continues to rule, but no longer'; the finances of the State are^Tn a precarious position, and the additional burden of a 4 retiring allowance to His Highness on abdication coupled with a civil list for the new Sultan, would be more than they could bear). A further objection/objection is the youth of the Heir Apparent (now 21) who, however, appears to be shaping well. In the light of a report by the Political Agent, Muscat, the Resident has submitted proposals for bringing pressure to bear on the Sultan. These are, brhfly:- (a) that he should be authorised to convey to His Highness an expression of the displeasure of the Government of India at his action and his ’’failure to comply with conditions on which the loan ' L of 1920] was made to him' (viz.. that he should spend at least three months of each year in Muscat, and that his allowance of Rs.10, 000 a no nth should be conditional on the ability of the State finances to meet the charge and on his good behaviour), and to inform him that he will in future receive Rs.5,000 per mensem only. The Resident is m error in suggesting that these conditions attached to the loan of 1920. The kGytf l4 ^ that loan m set out in paragraphs 28-31 of the India Office ifemorandum on Muscat, flagged in the file. The conditions specified are set out in paragraph 29. They included 'fixation of amount of privy purse', and at the Sultan's request the privy purse was in fact fixed at Rs.10,000. But the conditions that he should reside in Muscat for at least three months a year and that the privy purse should be definitely fixed at Rs.10,000 per mensem, subject to His Highness's continued good behaviour and the^aMSify of the State finances to bear the strain, were imposed in March 1920 as a term of the grant cf our assistance to him 'in the negotiations with the rebels (of the interior) and in the continued reconstruction of his finances'. le are, however, clearly entitled to take/ G. of I. despatch o 31st March, 1921: P. 1969/21. &lt;/ A 0, , «**■ ftu ScfiJMinute Paper. 4* fU*vi*r* Department. take action on the lines recommended by the Resident, though it will be undesirable to suggest that our power to do so has anything to do with the terms of the loan of 1919-20. (b) That efforts should be made during the coming summer by the Political Agent and the Resident to induce His Highness to return next winter for the fixed period of three months. Should these efforts be unsuccessful, the Resident is inclined to suggest offering the Sultan the alternative of returning or of living in India on, &gt; say, Rs.3,000 per mensem, or whatever sum may be decided upon*. He is of opinion that financial pressure of this nature may make His Highness more amenable, and if his abdication can be staved off for another year or so, it may be possible to place the finances of the State on a somewhat more satisfactory basis. The position is complicated by the report contained m the Political Resident’s subsequent telegram of 24th January, of which a copy is at P.Z..450/31 below. This further emphasises the financial objections to allowing the Sultan to abdicate at the present time if it can at all be avoided. We have done a good deal for His Highness, and are doing our utmost to try to place his State on a somewhat more stable financial footing. We are reasonably entitled, in these circumstances, to expect him to meet us halfway; and if the Government of India approve/approve an immediate reduction such as the Political Resident suggests in the Sultan’s allowances, it is to be hoped that it nay help to bring him to his senses. .

In point of fact considering that the Council will send the Multan his allowance every raonth, and that the royal family and Kasib - the chief creditor * exorcise a gooddeal of influenoa over the Cornell, think it is fairly certain that the claiiaante will get a pretty good share* Anyhow we can leave the* to settle it amongst themselves*' 12 * 1 agree with the above views and would submit the follow n, suggestions for the consideration of the overnment of India* Firstly, 1 recommend that they sh uld condone the failure of the Dultan to return during this winter* it ie too la'e to get him back now and 1 do not think that anything can be done this winters j ou^gest however that I should be authorised to convey to him an expression of their displeasure at his action and his failure to comply with the conditions on which the loan //a jL aade to him, and to inform him that he would in future only * I get ;s. 5 , 000 /- per mensem instead of the he* 10 , 0 - 0 /- per mensem which he is ge ting at present* IS* Secondly, 1 consider that during the coming summer efsorts should be mde y the political gent and myself - if I go to India - to induce the sultan to come lack next winter for the fixed period of three months. I am not very hopeful that we shall be succeseful, but it is at any rate worth trying. If these attempts fail, we can then consider the question of the Multan’s pension, which I think should be less than Ks*5000/- per mensem, and we can offer him the alternative of returning or of living in India on, say, ns*&amp;0OO/- per mensem or whatever sum may lc decided upon* s he will then have had a taste of living on : s*5000/- per mensem and will probacly have been some what harassed by his creditors, mere is trie prospect that a •till further reduction in hi 3 income may uliima.ely bring him to his senses and may o&amp;ke him always realise what he has consistently .consistently failed to realise up to the present,naaely, that the state cannot and will net mintain him in comfort and idleness. This should carry as on for another year-aicS 1 during which it should de possible to place the finances on a somewhat more satisfactory basis, and there is just the possibility that it may make the Sultan think that on the whole a short sojourn in Muscat erery year is a small price to pay for nine oonths comfort and ease during the remainder ol the year in India and is preferable to twelve months of comparative penury* 14.

After greetings and many salutations, In the Lest of the time we received with the hand of pleasure your honour’s esteemed letter No.44-T of 1930, dated the 11th November 1930,corresponding to the 21st Jamadi ath Thani 1349. He read it with great attention and care and your friend understood its contents to the end. Yes, as regards the question of our coming to Muscat, just as your honour already learnt from our last letter and from what we spoke verbally to your Agent at Muscat, tiaj or Fowle, we have no wish to do so for the reasons which we already expressed. And we inform your honour and we request you to submit it to our friend the Government of India that the fixed bounty of a Lakh of Rupees which they bestow upon us in lieu of the losses suffered by us we do not think that our abdication should cause a cut of this financial aid. ..e have every hope for the attention • • • • +- 2 - attention of the High Government at this time of impend ing financial danger to the Government of Muscat to continue this aid and to favour by changing their former view. The deficiency and the losses in finance of Muscat and the acute difficulties ensuing therefrom are not hidden from you. In view of the financial difficulties of our Government, the necessary expenditure for our successor and for ourselves should be made from that aid. And we inform your honour, just as you mentioned in your letter that our arguments and our rejection of the reduced pay in 1921 were in order. And no doubt that your Political Agent at Muscat knows fully well as to what amount is sufficient for the expenses of the person of the Sultan of Ifuscat to manage his affairs, and we do not doubt that the headquarters of the Political Resident at Bushire are also aware of this important point. And as we mentioned, necessary simple expenditure would suffice during our abdication. It is not hidden from you that we have no income except what we receive from the Treasury of our Government. And no doubt that the allowance should be sufficient. Just as we mentioned in our last letter to you we had explained to azir Thomas what would be sufficient for our expenditure, and it cannot be less than tnat, and we hope that he would explain it to you when he meets you at Muscat. And we know your inability to reach Karachi as proposed by us and the Consul of Muscat, and we are sorry for our inability to come to Muscat. sa regards y our ,.. /34-? ) -3- V your proceeding there and discussing with the Council of Ministers and the Consul about fixing expenditure for our successor and for ourselves, undoubtedly tnat is your important bisiness in this important arrange- / ment# And your honour has mentioned that perhaps some arrangement may not oe in accordance to our wishes* *Ve say had we not been trusting and relying upon the (High) Government and their men in our affairs, it may therefore be that whatever is against our wisnes(is) in the interests of the both parties- our friend the (High) Government and the Government of Muscat, and (of) the preservation of this dynasty* And God willing, in the second week of .December, we shall proceed from ^erahdum Ceylon* In the end ( we say ) we are ever amongst those i faithful.

As the Political Agent, Muscat, Major Powle informed you i had gone to Kashmir for a month, owing to the great heat of Dehra Dun and to the bad state of my health. Towards the end of last September I went tiger shooting, but without success. It was however good exercise which the doctors advise me to take and I am very fond of shooting• As you know during my stay in Kashmir, I had some correspondence with Major fowle and after my return at the end of August, he came and saw me in order to discuss the question of nazir Thomas ana it was mutually agreed upon that some other official and Adviser should take his place in the Finance Ministry of our State. Ity reason for agreeing to this was the improvement of the finances of the Muscat State. / As regards what you say a ,out the favour which our friend the Government of India have been pleased to bestow, by making understandings with, and seeking the consent of the two friendly Governments of the United States of America and of France, with reg-rd to the increase in Customs • • •.35-Z i Cust-Jias tariff of Muscat and ’Oman, I thank the Government of India for the efforts they are making to improve the Muscat Gt&amp;te, and I also thank you for your efforts and hope that you will soon obtain the consent of the French Jovernment,, as you have obtained that of the United States of America* As regards what you say about your visit to 2ur, and that you have persuaded the Shaikh of the Ban! Bu 1 Ali to refrain from agitation there, I hope that he will fulfil his undertakings and thank you for your efforts* I trust that in future no further trouble will arise at Sur that may necessitate the Muscat State troubling the Government. I trust that Divine Providence will assist the Muscat State and that an improvement will be effected in the Customs revenue at Sur and that the State Treasury will be benefited thereby. I am certain that the difficulties are due to the present fall in the value of silver arid the dollar exchange and this has brought about heavy losses in this country and particularly in the finances of the Muscat State, as pointed out by you. It certainly is necessary for the Muscat State to exercise economy, so as to bring about an improvement in its finances. I confirm what the Political Agent, Major Fowle, wrote to you with regard to my determination not to return to Muscat# The reason for this is that I am unable to perform the duties incumbent on me in the interests of my State and subjects owing to the ailments of which I have long been complaining. I would make it clear to you that this is not the first year that 1 left Muscat with the intention of not returning and you have doubtless read what your • •-3- your predecessors have left on record at Bushire Heaidency and at Museat Consulate. 1’his decision is not a recent one* but was made several years ago and last year I announced it definitely to the Political Agent, Muscat, in reply to a letter of his and then confirmed it to him in an interview at Karachi, as you know. If the ailments of which I complair had not disabled me I would certainly iiave carried on my duties in agreement with you. lajor Powle made every effort to dissuade me from this determination, but I could not lorce my soul to its hard task. .Finally he (Major Fowle) asked me to travel to Muscat for two or three weeks, but I did not a, ree to do so and in all the replies that I gave him 1 regarded him as your representative and of the friendly • &gt;overnment ( of India ), and he finally stated, as you have also done, that an interview with you was absolutely essential and then he asked me whether it would be possible for me to go to Karachi to meet you. To this I agreed and I am ready for an interview with you with all pleasure and honour at Karachi at any time and hour which you may like to fix. But i am not prepared to go to Muscat and I dropped you a hint about my intentions and illnesses in the course of your visit to Muscat and our interview there in the month of Kovember last. £s regards what you say that, in the event of my renouncing the rule of our State and abdicating, the authority will rest in the hands of a young ruler, devoid of experience: in my belief and opinion, he ( my successor ) is fully qualified like his predecessors and with the help of the Government and assistance of intelligent men and the support of !r od, he will be able to effect improvements in the otatc, and to carry out the duties assigned to him and the • •-4- . i&gt; // ■ the under taking o towards the friendly Govern/aent of 1 ndia.

Last year, however, i r our Highness had been for several months in Muscat and was eble to travel to Dhofar and other places in your territory and in ft inter the climate in Muscat is very pleasant. 1 am confident therefore that a visit in the winter to Muscat could not possibly injure Your Highness’ health and that with the sympathetic advice of Major Fowl®, the Political Agent, and the assistance of the new */aair, you would not find the performance of your duties unduly difficult.

As I have no reason to suppose that the Government of India have in any way modified their previous deoisiai in this matter, Your Highness will readily realise in what grave financial difficulty your abdication will involve the State since not only will the subsidy stop but also, as I pointed out previously, it will be necessary to give a suitable civil list to four Highness’ successor, and make some provision for your own expenses, and I must tell you frankly that the State is not in a position at the present time to meet this expenditure. Your Highness states that your needs are simple and that you will not require a large allowance* Your Highness will however doubtless remember that in 1921 owing to the fact that you did not return to the State, it was found necessary • * •necessary to reduce the allowance which you drew from the State and on that occasion Your Highness protested strongly against this reduction and said that you could not manage on the reduced allowance that was then fixed. Your Highness has suggested that I should come and meet you at Karachi. As you are aware, I have many important duties to perform in the Persian Gulf and many places to visit during the cold weather, and it is very difficult for me to absent myself for the period necessitated by a journey to Karachi and back. In any case I cannot go to Karachi in the near future and the important matters which will have to be settled, should Your Highness not return, cannot wait till then. If Your Highness is unwilling to return to Muscat, the only course open to me will be to discuss the important matters that will have to be settled, such as the Civil List of Your Highness* successor, the allowance of Your Highness, etc. with the Council of State and the Political Agent, and to make my recommendations to the Government of India without having the benefit of Y 0 ur highness* advice and without consultation with you except by letter, and in these circumstances it Ts possible that some ofthe decisions arrived at may not be in accordance with Your Highness* wishes or views, a matter which I would very greatly regret. In these circumstances, I would urge Your Highness to reconsider your decision and instead of proceeding to Ceylon to come to Muscat as soon as possible, I shall be ready then to visit you there and we can discuss these matters together. I desire to express the high consideration which I entertain for Your Highness and to subscribe myself, Your Highness* sincere friend, sd/ H.V.Biscoe Lt.Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.21 OCT ^30 Previous Papers 4407b 1000 3.30 Please see Colonel Biscoe’s previous despatch ol 28th December last on P. 517/30, flagged, on this subject, and paragraph 4 of the Departmental note onHit &lt;4mthat paper. Since then, as the Resident points out, v’e have done our utmost to meet His Highness by asking the French and American Governments to agree to the modification of their tariff treaties with Muscat, so as to admit of a general increase in the Muscat tariff, and by securing what appears to be a satisfactory settlement of the situation at Bur. in these circumstances, we are entitled to expect the Sultan to go some way to meet us on the question of abdication, though it is to be feared that we can bring effective/ ’effective pressure to bear upon him. only by the threat that if he does abdicate, he cannot expect to receive any but a meagre allowance frcm his State. The Sultan at present draws Rs.ft),OCC a month, subject to his spending three months of the year in Muscat. It will be remembered that the financial position of Muscat is exceedingly serious, and, despite every care on the part of a the Financial Adviser, has shown/progressive Cfl • 3 6 /' 0 , /*£ 0 • e\*.

The arms traffic subsidy of Rs.l lakh drawn by the Sultan is personal to His Highness during the period of his rule. If it were withdrawn and if the State were to be required to pay anything between Rs.6C,000 and Rs.pCjCOC a year to an absentee Ruler, in addition to providing for the Civil List of the actual Ruler, the position would become critical. No doubt when the tine cones it will be necessary to consider the renewal of the arms traffic subsidy to the new Sultan, if the State is to be kept going (and the importance of maintaining its stability is obvious). But there,, is no reason why we should not take a fairly firm line with tfee,Sultan, though the position is complicated by his nominal independence and the existence oi his treaties with foreign Powers. For the moment there is nothing to be done but to await His Highness’s reply to colonel Biscoe’s letter, and the results of the contemplated discussion nex o November, should the Sultan agree to return to Muscat, as/ *I Conf idential- M r~lT~ 6 7 9 6 U - IQ a n ; British nesidency and CoH^&gt;4a I a iTPi.^yj^nerc^l , uushire, the 16th September 1950. ho. 494-S. of 193U. ^ 1 (. i n&gt; *'j (j ► 4, tl(r&lt;lr&gt; p£'\fy Sir, I h£.ve the honour to forward for the information of Jtiis Majesty's Government a copy of my despatch of even number and date, and of its enclosure, to the foreign secretary to the Govern ment of India, on the subject of the intention of His Highness the Sultan of Lius cay to abdicate. i have the honoui? to be, Sir, lour most obedient, humble servant, L*-C i-'olitical nesident in the Persian Gulf. nt.-Colone1, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, India uffice, jliUuJJUu.E0.494-J of 1950* British Residency Sc Consulate-General 9 Bushire 9 the 16th Septan!er 1930* ^rom - The Hon*hie It*Colonel H#V#Biscoe 9 I.A# 9 Political Resident in the Persian Gulf To - The Foreign Secretary to she Goyernment of India 9 appoiiitaenu/ ox succeoaujr vo • x uu -uxti t tic px crovitw «onsix* vx the Muscat State, and the Sultan's intention, announced to the Political Agent, of abdicating, I have the honour to state that X have since received from ui&amp;jor Fowle &amp; detailed account of his interview with the Sultan* ^ 2* Major Fowle writes: ” His Highness seamed to take Ur* Thomas' departure philosophically, which was convenient.

X trust your health has been benefited by the change and that Your Highness is enjoying the beautiful scenery of .Dehra Dun* 4hen I saw Your Highness in November last you put two requests before me: (i) that steps should be taken to improve the finances of the Muscat State by obtaining the consent of the Government of the United States and of the French Government to an increase in the customs tariff, and (ii) that the authority of the State should be re-established at - _ j,:, Sur. xn accordance with Your Highness’ wishes I promptly addressed the Government of India on the subject of the tariff and am glad to be able to inform* 2 - inform Your Highness that the Government of the United States have already agreed to the proposed increase in the tariff and I hope that the consent of the French Government will he obtained in a short time. Further I myself proceeded to Sur and interviewed Shalth All of Jaalan and he agreed to refrain from flying his own flag at Aiqa and will, X trust, adopt &amp; more submissive attitude in future towards Your Highness. I also hope that it will be possible to take steps to improve the administration of the Gur Customs so that the State will derive more revenue from them in future. -nfortunatel* the fall in the dollar exchange has adversely affected the finances of the State and, as you know, for many years past the administration has been starved and there has been no possibility of effecting any improvements, iilven if some additional revenues are obtained from an increase in the tariff and the Sur Customs thore is no doubt whatever that for a long time to come it will be necessary to exercise the most stringent economy. It is for this reason that the Government of India suggested to Your Highness that it would be preferable not to extend Mr.Thomas* contract but to obtain the services of an officer on a considerably smaller salary. 1 am glad to hear from Major Fowle that Your Highness approves of this measure and I am confident that the officer whom it is proposed to appoint in Mr. Thomas* place will work hard and loyally to serve the Muscat State. Major Fowle however writes that Your- -3- ^our Hi .hness inioriaed him thRi you did not Intend to roturn to mueeat* THie came as a very great surprise to me* 1 am aware, of course, that Tour Highness had discussed the question of abdication with my predecessors / but as Tour Highness uade no reference to the matter in conversation with me l assumed that you had arrived at no definite decision in the matter and 1 hoped tha^if steps wsre taken to improve the finances of the Unseat Stats and to re-establish Tour highness 1 authority in those port! ns of the ttate where It had been weakened Ofcs+ Tour Highness would refrain from this step* If when you esw me last November it was st that time your definite resolve to abdioate then 1 think you should have mentioned the matter to me* X would like to urge you, ay friend, to reconsider this matter since it will have most serious offsets* firstly, at a time when every effort is being made to put the affairs of Muscat on a ;&amp;or* satisfactory basis it will deprive the administration ef the benefit of Tour Highness* long experience and Tour Highness will probably be replaced by a young and inexperienced ruler* Secondly, it will have the most disastrous effect upon the finances of the State at a time when, as X have already pointed out, the most rigid economy is essential* As you know; the Arms Traffic subsidy of Hs* 1,00,000/- per annum at present paid by the Government of India to the Muscat State is personal to Tour Highness and X can hold out no hope that it will be continued to Tour Highness 1 successor* Again, whoever may be appointed to succeed lour Highness will bars to bs given a suitable civil list befitting the uler of the State to enable himhim to oaintctin his position* It will therefore obviously not be possible to give Tour Highness the allowance which you at present draw fro a the tate while in lndia f and X greatly fear that the sum which it would be possible for the state to give to Xour Highness would be a small one* Finally, there are ether loatters connected with the future administration of the State regarding which it is essential that I should have the benefit of Tour Hi hness* views and about which you will doubtless wish to be consulted* on £our Highness that you should .'mice no decision in the Matter at present but should come and disouse tha- matter with me* X propose arriving at muscat on the 19th Koveaher and if convenient to Tour Highness 1 suggest that you should co«e to Muscat then and that we she Id talk over the whole question and consider what is best to be done both for the State and for Tour Highness* which i entertain for four Highness and to subscribe ayself i^or the above reasons X would strongly urge I desire to express the high consideration Tour Highness oa/ H.V.’ i*«oe M.Col onel,4 CONFIDENTIAL. INDIA OFFICE, B. 400. P. 4640/2S. MUSCAT: 1908-1928. I.—Administration. 1. His Highness Saiykl Taimnr bin Faisal bin Turki, K.C.I.E. (1926), C.S.I. (1917), Sultan of Muscat and Oman, born in 1885, succeeded his father, Sultan Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki, G.C.l. E., who had ruled the Sultanate since 1888, in 1913. He has three sons, of whom the eldest, Saiyid Said, is being educated at an Arab school in Baghdad. His Highness, who is entitled to a salute of 21 guns, represented his father at the Delhi Durbar, 1902-3, and visited England in the summer of 1928, when he was received in audience by the King, and entertained as a State guest for a period of a month. 2. The Sultan is an independent potentate who has commercial treaties with the Governments of France (1841) and the United States (1833), as well as with His Majesty’s Government. There is in addition a commercial declaration of 1877 with the Dutch Government. Under the Anglo-French declaration of 1862, His Majesty’s Government and the French Government engage reciprocally to respect the independence of ihe Sultan of Muscat (as of the Sultan of Zanzibar). Under his treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government, a precis of which is contained in the memorandum printed as an Appendix on page f|], the Sultan is pledged never to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, his dominions, save to His Majesty’s Government, to whom, in addition, the right to search and seize Muscat ships suspected of carrying slaves was ceded in 1873, as was the right (simultaneously ceded to Persia) to search Muscat vessels tor arms in Muscat waters in 1898. The right to search Muscat vessels for arms on the high seas was ceded to His Majesty’s Government and the Italian Government in 1903. Ilis Highness has further undertaken not to grant oil concessions without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. While, however, the Sultan is in theory a wholly independent ruler, since the end of the eighteenth century British influence has been predominant in Muscat, and in practice the relations which obtain between its ruler and His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India very closely approximate to those which obtain between the Government of India and an Indian State under the suzerainty of His Majesty. 3. The internal administration of Muscat is carried out by an Advisory Council of Ministers (President, Minister of Finance, Minister of Religious Affairs, Minister of Justice), 52 ' purely Arab with the exception noted below, presided over by His Highness’s brother, Saiyid Nadir.t The Council, which the Sultan was required to institute in 1920 as a condition of the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in the reconstruction of his adminis tration and in negotiations with the rebel Omani tribes (see para. 35), is entitled to a salute of 17 guns, individual members receiving live and the President nine, or 13 if a member of the ruling House. In theory it exercises all ordinary powers of administration, not only during the absence, but during the presence of the Sultan at Muscat, subject to the retention by His Highness of power to decide all matters of extraordinary importance affecting the interests of his State or his dynasty4 It does not, however, appear in the past to have exercised in practice a very effective control. At the request of the Sultan, an Englishman, Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., formerly assistant British representative in Trans-Jordan,§ was appointed in 1925 as Financial Adviser. In 1926 Mr. Thomas was appointed Wazir and a member of the Muscat Council, functioning as Finance Minister, but having also a full share in the government of the State. The result has been a marked improvement in the general level of efficiency of administration. 4. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are represented in Muscat by the Political Agent, who is an officer of the Indian Political Department, on the cadre of which the appointment is borne.

Murphy, Indian Army, lias been maintained without interruption since its revival' 1 * after the separation of Muscat from Zanzibar in 1861. In 1869 it was placed in strict subordination to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.f Since 1867 the Political Agent has also held His Majesty’s Commission as Consul for Muscat. Under the Muscat Order in Council of 1915 (see paras. 63-4 below), which replaced the Muscat Order in Council of 1867, the Political Agent is the District Magistrate and Sessions Judge, and exercises his powers subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, j he limits of the Order are co-extensive with the territories and territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 5. \o specific reference was made to Muscat in the Report of the Masterton-Smith Committee, and while, under the general principle embodied m that Committee, matters of political significance on the north Arabian littoral which may affect relations with Ibn Sand fall to be dealt with by or m consultation with the Colonial Office, such matters rarely, if at all, arise m Muscat, and political control may in consequence be regarded as resting, as in the pre-war period, with the Government of India, subject to the general control of His Majesty’s Government. Under the principles embodied in the Masterton-Smith Report, the internal affairs of the State are in any event the direct concern of the Government of India. 6. With the inconsiderable exception referred to below, expenditure in Muscat is wholly borne by Indian revenues. That expenditure consists of subsidies to the Sultan, of Durbar presents, and of the cost of maintaining the 1 optical Agency. The subsidies consist of an annual sum of Rs. 86,400, « — -- — -eptember 1883 been wholly an Indian charge),J and of the annual subsidy of Rs. 1 lakh paid since 1912 (see paras. 12 and 22 below) in compensation for the losses to the Sultan arising out of the suppression of the arms traffic, which will cease with the tenure of power by the present Sultan. These charges are fixed, and their amount (loes not vary In the latest year for which authoritative figures are available (1019-20) the cost ol the Political Agency was Rs. 78,427, and in the same year Durbar presents amounted to Us. 5,000.§ The solitary item of expenditure shared with His Majesty’s Government is a yearly payment in respect ol anti-slavery measures, the amount of which in 1926 was Rs. 73 -iyu» to 4tti October 1913 aiutan xaisai. 6. Hie dominating feature of the period between 1908 and 1913 is the successful suppression, in agreement with the Sultan of Muscat of the aims tiaffic from his State, and no other question of sufficiently ’o-eneral interest to call lor reference in this Memorandum arose in the closing years of the icign of Sultan Faisal. The rebellion of the Omani tribes which bioke out some months before his death on 4th October 1913 beWs pi incipally to i*cign of his successor. It is dealt with in a separate section m paras. 43 to 52 below. P lldL e The Suppression of the Arms Traffic from Muscat. . J' At the beginning of the period a general prohibition of the arms traffic was in force on the Persian Gulf littoral save in Muscat. The Su tan of Muscat had prohibited m 1891 the import or export of arms and ammunition to or Irom Gwadur, i s dependency on tL Pw r./ i »f ,S 98 Hi,,,,;,,, arms from Muscat to India and Persia where the import of arms wasXga and had empowered Persia and Great Britain to act on his behalf L 1 • ’ enforcing this prohibition within Muscat territorial waters In 1903 he' had further agreed to the search by British and Italian ships of Muscat vessels on the high seas suspected of carrying arms. But the import of arms X M ,1 scab and their export, except to India and Persia, were still unprohib ted8. The result was to make Muscat the recognised centre of the trade in arms for the whole Middle East. At the beginning of the period now in question, the main channel of distribution was from Muscat across the Gulf to the coast of Persian Makran, whence arms were taken up country by caravans, ultimately reaching the tribesmen of Afghanistan and the North- West Frontier of India. From 11)10-11, the stringency of the prohibitive measures imposed by Ilis Majesty’s Government led to the adoption, in preference, of smuggling to El Ivatr. on the Arabian coast, then still under Turkish control, and thence across the Gulf to the Persian coast of Laristan. 9. The constant flow of modern arms of precision from Muscat to the North-West Frontier of India created a very serious situation for the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. 1 he situation was one which could be dealt with adequately only by the suppression of the free trade in arms at Muscat. The fact that the Sultan had commercial treaties not only with His Majesty’s Government, but with the United States of America and France, which expressly provided for the unrestricted import and export of all kinds of merchandise (with certain specified exceptions) ; that he had further a commercial declaration which provided for reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment between Muscat and Holland; that a large part of the trade in arms was in the hands of certain French firms with considerable political influence in the Chamber ; and that the French Government, unlike the Governments of the United States of America and Holland, was not prepared to sacrifice its treaty rights provided other Treaty Powers did the same, made it extremely difficult to take effective steps to this end. 10. The efforts made by His Majesty’s Government to provide a quid pro quo acceptable to the French Government having failed, steps were taken, in the light of a reiteration at the Brussels Arms Conference of 1908-9 of the refusal of Prance to modify her attitude, to suppress the traffic so far as was practicable without the violation of existing treaty rights. Towards the end of 1909 a naval blockade was instituted, which was still in being on the outbreak of the War in 1914, but which, though it met with very- considerable success, proved extremely costly. Between 1910 and 1912 further lengthy negotiations took place in consequence with the French Government and with the Sultan. The Sultan, who saw in the suppression of the traffic not merely a possible occasion of immediate compensation from His Majesty’s Government, but the closing of the most convenient source from which the rebellious tribes in the interior of Oman could arm themselves against him, was generally amenable, though in 1911-12 his financial difficulties, which delivered him into the hands of the arms dealers,‘ :i: ' led him for a time to change from an attitude of neutrality towards the trade, to active, if surreptitious, participation in it. The French Government, however, remained unyielding, and in view of the complete failure of the negotiations with them, it was decided to disregard France, and to endeavour to concert with the Sultan of Muscat some local arrangements for a satisfactory control of the trade.'!* 11. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the various incidents which took place in connection with the suppression of the traffic between 1910 and 1912, or to enter into details of the discussions which took place during that period with the Sultan and with France. Suffice it to say that, after lengthy negotiation, an arrangement was finally reached with His Highness in May 1912. Under this the Sultan agreed to establish at Muscat a bonded warehouse under sufficient control, in which all arms and ammunition would be deposited on importation, the warehouse to be in charge of a trustworthy person from among his subjects. All issues from the warehouse would be regulated by special licences prepared by the Superintendent and counter signed by the Sultan personally, and such licences would be issued only to individual purchasers or their authorised agents subject to satisfactory proof that the issue involved was “ free from justifiable objection.” Licences would not be issuable to traders. 12. The terms on which the Sultan agreed to this settlement were as follows. He was to receive as compensation an immediate lump sum I.O. Memo. B. 175, 182, 196. * Cf). tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I., Jan. 14 1911, P. 171, P. 200. f I.O. to F.O , July 19 1911.4 payment of 1 lakh of rupees, together with 1 lakh of rupees per annum in phe future, paid monthly in advance. In addition he was to receive compensation for certain specific losses in 1909 and 1911. The Sultan was further guaranteed that His Majesty’s Government would give him all the necessary support to dispose of objections that might ensue from France or other Powers; that no right was given by the arrangement to His Majesty’s 0^ Government or their officials to take action in his territories any more than in the past; and that a friendly understanding should be reached with him by His Majesty’s Government as to suitable arraugements for the supply of the bond fide needs of his administration and his subjects. 13. The arrangement, which was to come into force, after three months’ notice, on the 1st September 1912, was published on the 4th June 1912, came into operation on the appointed date, and was subsequently maintained with complete success. 14. Very serious difficulty immediately arose with the French Government, which expressed its readiness to approve the regulations only subject to the compensation of the 4rench merchants, who had hitherto played a consider able part in the arms trade. Compensation to French interests would have meant compensation to the other interests—Muscat, British, German, Belgian- affected, and the objections to it from the standpoint of His Majesty s Government were overwhelming. The fact that England, while a joint guarantor with France of Muscat independence under the Agreement with France of 1862, was not a party to the French Treaty of 1844 with Muscat, under which the arms trade was permissible, further complicated the issue. 15. His Majesty’s Government, however, made it clear to the French Government on the 14th September 1912, that they were firmly determined to support the Sultan in maintaining the regulations, which, they stated, in their view did not infringe 4 rench treaty rights, but merely regulated a dangerous trade, a right enjoyed by every Government. They added that, while compensation without arbitration could not be admitted, as His Majesty’s Government did not recognise that French rights were infringed, they were prepared to submit the question to arbitration.

F.O. to I.O., Dec. 22 1920, P. 8997. 16. After lengthy and difficult negotiations, which lasted until the early Part of 1914, the 4rench Government agreed- to recognise the regulations in force at Muscat, and the right of the Sultan to amend those regulations with the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government, if His Majesty’s Government, m dnect negotiation with the 4rench trade interests affected could arrive at an agreement as to the terms on which those interests should be bought out. An agreement having been reached,! under which £64 495 was paid by His Majesty’s Government to the interested firms an exchange of notes took place on 4th February 1914, by the settlement ’ embodied in which the 4rench Government undertook 51 no longer to claim for their nationals the privileges and immunities secured under the Treaty between 4 ranee and Muscat of 1844, in so far as those privileges and immunities conflict with the regulations for the prevention of the illicit trade inarms and ammunition in the Sultanate. In other respects the Treaty of 1844 remains in force.” The expenditure involved was divided equally between Indian and Imperial revennes.t It was decided that no compensation should be paid to British firms affected. 17. While a continual vigilance is called for, the steps taken to nut a stop to the arms traffic from Muscat, as described above have been completely successful. In 1021,§ and again in 1925,|| the Political Resident was able to report that, save for the Batineh coast, on which a truculent Omani tribe (the Yal Saad) are not under the Sultan’s effective control (c/. para. 52), Muscat had entirely fallen out of the arms traffic ■ and the fact that under the post-war Arms Traffic Convention, to which the Sultan has adhered at the request of His Majesty’s Government,^ Arabia had been made a prohibited area for the import or export of arms, has for practical purposes disposed of the probability of the recurrence in present circumstances'of international difficulties. io Internal History of Muscat from Accession of Sultan Taimur, 4th October 1913 to 1928. IS. Sultan Faisal died on 4th October 1913.His son, Saiyid Taimur, had in practice, if not formally, for some years previously been recognised as heir apparent,t and while His Majesty’s Government had in the past in Muscat postponed recognition of a successor until they were satisfied that a particular claimant was assured of the general support of the more important •elements and could be regarded as the dc facto ruler, the demise of the late bultan at a time when the interior was in a state of revolt, the urgent necessity of establishing a fresh administrative centre, and the fact that Saiyid Taimur was familiar with the policy of his predecessor, and could probably be relied upon to follow that policy in the vital matter of the arms traffic, decided them in favour of his immediate recognition.^ This the Political Agent was authorised to convey to the Saiyid in November 1913. The French Government, who had suggested that the two Governments reconnaissent en mcme temps the new ruler,§ were informed that while His Majesty’s Government, as they had already indicated, adhered to the Declaration of 1802, it was their usual practice to recognise the de facto ruler, and that they had accordingly already authorised the Government of India to take this step in the case of Sultan Taimur, especially as they understood that the French Consul at Muscat only awaited the receipt of instructions by his British colleague himself to accord official recognition on behalf of France. 19. But the recognition had not been unconditional. The new Sultan had been required as a prior condition to state that he accepted all the •obligations which his father bore towards His Majesty’s Government, and that in regard to the arms traffic as well as other matters he intended to pursue his father’s policy, and undertook “ to be guided by our advice in all important matters.”|| And, immediate recognition having been granted by His Majesty’s Government on compliance by the Saiyid with these preliminary demands, further requirements were presented to him as a condition of the continuance of the subsidies granted to his predecessor. 20. Of these subsidies the Zanzibar subsidy was one the precise •conditions antecedent to the grant of which are a matter of some dispute. It would, however, appear that those conditions are that a Sultan should be acknowledged by His Majesty’s Government and should promise friendship and the maintenance of his treaty obligations, and that subject to this he might prefer an absolute claim. The arms traffic subsidy of 11s. 1 lakh per annum had, however, been personal to Sultan Feisal, and, while it was essential that the new ruler should afford the co-operation in the suppression of the trade to secure which it had been granted, he could prefer no claim to it as •of right. 21. After lengthy discussion between the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office, it was finally decided that the Sultan should be required as a condition of the regrant of the subsidies to agree to postpone for five years, or such shorter period as His Majestv’s Government might desire, the revision of the Commercial Treaty of 1891°*; a decision being deferred pending further examination on two connected questions—the assent of His Highness to the establishment of a Muscat Levy Corps, and his agreement to conclude no further treaties with foreign Powers without the consent of His Majesty’s Government. The second of these questions was one which had arisen towards the close of the reign of Sultan Faisaljf, the disposal of which presented political difficulties owing to the position of France vis-d-vis the State, and which was still under examination when the outbreak of the European War in August 1914 made its immediate pursuit unnecessary.JJ It has not been revived. For various reasons the proposal to raise a Muscat Levy Corps (to which the Foreign Office saw no political objection in 1914§§ so long as the force was nominally a Muscat force and commanded by officers nominally in the service of the Sultan) produced no result until 1921 (see para. 31). 22. The arms traffic subsidy was renewed without a very clear definition -of the terms of its renewal, though the intention both of His Majesty’s * P. 4116/13. t Tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I., Oct. 20 1913, P. 4318/13. x F.O. to I.O., Oct. 31 1913, P. 4518. § M.

Government and the Government of India had been that, as in tne case of Sultan Feisal, it should be personal to the ruler.' :i: ' The complete success of the restrictions imposed on the arms traffic, the extension to Arabia of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919, and the financial stringency of the post war period, led at a later stage to re-examination of the position in regard to^^ this subsidy, and as a result the Sultan was warned in 1922 that, while it would be continued to him during his tenure of power, it would not be admissible to his successor. In this decision Jlis Highness reluctantly acquiesced. 2o. The dominating position in Muscat throughout the war was the rebellion of the Omani tribes, which Sultan Taimur inherited as a legacy from his predecessor, which he found himself unable to quell on his accession, and the history of which is separately dealt with in paras. 43 to 52 of this Memorandum. The pre-occupation of the State with this problem absorbed its energies during the War period, while its relative remoteness from the politics of Central Arabia resulted in its isolation from the disputes of Ibn Sand and Ibn Rashid, and from the development of events alike at the head of the Gulf and on the coast of the Red Sea. 24, It is unnecessary to enter in any detail into the internal affairs of Muscat (as distinct from the Omani rebellion) in the early years of the war. The control of the arms traffic, itself no inconsiderable element in that rebellion, was on the whole satisfactority maintained. Hut the Sultan retained his throne thanks only to the active military assistance and support of His Majesty’s Government, a support not extended to the administration of his State until 1918; his administration, never distinguished, became hopelessly corrupt; while His Highness’s financial position, as the result of the inefficiency of his servants, the demands of the campaign against the Omanis, and the loss of revenue involved in the Omani rebellion, gradually deteriorated until in 1918 it could be described as desperate.f 25. The Government of India and His Majesty’s Government, committed by their undertakings of 1895 and 1913 to secure the safety of the coast towns of Muscat and Muttrah (cp. para. 45), in the early part of the war confined their action to implementing these undertakings with some generosity of interpretation, and abstained from interference in the internal policy of the State. But the inefficiency of the internal administration, the action taken at the behests of His Majesty’s Government by the Sultan and his predecessor, and the Omani rebellion were closely interwoven; the strategic position of Muscat, athwart the main route to the headwaters of the Gulf and to Mesopotamia, was of vital interest; the nominal independence of the Sultan rendered his situation of more than local importance, and in 1917 the then Political Agent, Major Haworth, submitted for consideration a programme the acceptance of which would involve active interference in the internal affairs of Muscat by the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. 20. The proposals of the Political Agent were that a levy corps should be established under British officers ; that a loan should be granted the Sultan sufficient to rid him of his liabilities; and that as a condition of the loan His Highness should agree to the transfer to British control of the Muscat customs, to the appointment of a British adviser and to the establishment of an educational system the ultimate result of which would be the provision of a nucleus of Muscat subjects educationally qualified for employment in the local administration, which had hitherto been whollv dependent on alien talent. 27. Major Haworth's proposals necessitated careful consideration in the light of the Declaration of .1862, under which His Majesty’s Government had become a joint guarantor with France of the independence of Muscat. A further difficulty was the uncertainty as to the authority with which respon sibility for Muscat affairs would rest after the war, and the reluctance of the Government of India to initiate a policy the development of which was unlikely to rest with them. But circumstances forced the pace : negotiations with the Omani rebels in the spring of 1918 were unproductive, the financialsituation became, if possible, more critical; the reactions of maladministration at home, alike on the financial situation and on relations with the tribes of the interior, became increasingly apparent; and in August 1918 the Government of India, after further discussion with Sir Percy Cox and Major Haworth, ^pressed to the Secretary of State for India the view that action could not e postponed indefinitely, and submitted proposals to meet the situation. 28. The Government of India suggested the offer to the Sultan of a loan of Rs. 51 lakhs at 0 per cent, interest to be paid off in 10 years and to be secured on the Muscat customs ; the loan to be conditional on agreement by His Highness to undertake a definite programme of reform which would result in financial reorganisation and the improvement of the administration of justice. I he Foreign Office did not consider'^' that the proposed loan could afford any ground for legitimate protest 1o the French Government, to whom no reference was accordingly made by His Majesty’s Government, and it was finally sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India on 4th December 1918.It was borne wholly by Indian revenues, the Treasury refusing to contribute.J 29. The programme of reform accepted by the Sultan as a condition of the loan covered the following points :—• (1) Appointment by His Highness of an Indian, to be selected by His Majesty’s Government, as Customs Director, who would in the first instance reorganise existing customs posts, and subsequently extend a customs system to all ports in Oman. (2) Fixation of amount of Privy Purse, remainder of State income being appropriated to charges of administration and payment of instalments and interest of loan. (3) Appointment of a Wazir or Dewan to conduct Courts of Justice and control proceedings of local governors of districts. (4) Improvement of roads, establishment of schools, &amp;c. (5) Reorganisation of Sultan’s guard with a view to its eventual use as nucleus for a levy corps. 30. Considerable discussion took place regarding these conditions in the •early part of 1919, Sir Arnold Wilson, then Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, feeling serious doubt as to whether they did not at once constitute too heavy a commitment on the part of His Majesty’s Government, and traverse the principles of self-determination embodied in the post-war policy of the Allies. They were, however, ultimately substantially accepted by the authorities •concerned, and were put into operation during 1919. It may be recorded for convenience at this point that the Commercial Treaty of 1891, which had been renewed for five years in 1914, was extended for one year jn 1919, and has been extended yearly since that date. 31. An additional loan of Rs. 1 lakh, borne, like the original loan, by Indian revenues, was sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India in February 1920, raising the total of the advance to Rs. lakhs, repayment of which was to be made in 19 equal half-yearly instalments of Rs. 46.740. 5.§ 32. The very considerable degree of indirect control represented by the measures described in para. 29 was justified from the point of view of Muscat by their results. By the beginning of 1920 the Sultan’s debts had been discharged with the assistance of the additional loan ; steps had been taken to introduce financial order; the result of the appointment on 1st October 1919 •of three trained Egyptian customs officials to reorganise the customs, which provided the major part of the revenue of the State, was seen in a balance in the Treasury on 1st October 1920 of Rs. 3| lakhs, j and a regular Court of Law, though with less immediately satisfactory results, had also been established. In addition, a European Wazir (Capt. McCollum, formerly Political Agent, Koweit) was employed from January to August 1920, when the reorganisation of the administration referred to in paras. 35-6 below rendered it possible to dispense with his services. Early in 1921, a Muscat levy corps under a British officer, which has since been maintained at a strength varying between 200 and 250, and which is now recruited from the Makran coast, made possible the withdrawal of the Indian troops maintained Tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I., Aug. 16 1918, P. 3661/18. * F.O. to I.O., Nov. 5 1918, P. 4913/18. t Tel. to Viceroy, Dec. 4 1918, P. 4913. £ Treasury to F.O., Jan. 10 1919 ; S. of S. for I. to Viceroy, Feb. 14 1919, P. 371/19.

Simultaneously with the reorganisation of the internal administration, the steps referred to in para. 49 below were being taken to bring about a settlement with the Omani tribes. With the attainment of a settlement ir^'' September 1920, the State found itself solvent and in sight of a condition of political stability such as it had not previously enjoyed. 34. While, however, the active intervention of His Majesty’s Government had secured the results described above in the allairs of the State, the Sultan, an agreeable but effete and indolent ruler, who had at no stage displayed the qualities of character necessary in the ruler of Oman, saw in the new dispensation an opportunity to divest himself of his nominal responsibilities, and in March 1920, in a private interview with the Viceroy, expressed his desire to abdicate and to reside permanently 7 in India. 33. Cither considerations apart, the facts that the tribal situation was still critical, that there was no obvious successor, and that the succession was a matter of more than local interest in view of the Sultan’s international treaties, rendered the proposal inopportune. Lord Chelmsford declined to countenance it, and His Highness was required to return to Muscat on the conclusion of his visit. But the Sultan was in name at least independent; his reluctant co-operation might do more harm than good, and a compromise, which by reducing His Highness’s interference with the administration might simplify the task of reorganisation, was not altogether without advantage. As a result, the Omani tribes having in the autumn of 1920 asked that negotiations might be reopened, the Political Agent, after personal consulta tion with the Government of India, was authorised to inform the Sultan that His Majesty’s Government were willing to assist him in the continued reconstruction of his finances and in his negotiations with the rebels on the following conditions :— (a) 1 hat if he persisted in his wish to live away from his State as much as possible, he should spend not less than five months every y r ear continuously 7 at Muscat. (/&gt;) That he should authorise the constitution of a regular Advisorv Council, purely Arab in composition, to exercise all the ordinary powers of administration, not only during his absence, but during the periods of his presence at Muscat. (c) That he should retain the power to decide all matters of extraordinary importance affecting the interests of his State or his dynasty. (d) That should he at any time change his mind and decide to live permanently at Muscat, these arrangements should be cancelled, and he should resume ali powers of administration, subject to the conditions of the loan made to him by His Majesty’s Government (see para. 28 above). 30. After lengthy discussions these conditions were accepted by His Highness subject to the reduction of the period of his obligatory annual residence at Muscat and to the fixation of his privy purse at Rs. 10,000 per mensem. The Government of India agreed to modify their requirements; the period of residence was fixed at four months and subsequently reduced to three ; and approval was given to a privy purse of Rs. 10,000 per mensem subject to His 11 ighness’s continued good behaviour and to the continued ability of the State finances to bear the strain. An arrangement on these lines has since been in operation. 37. The financial position gave ground for increasing uneasiness in ] 923 and 1924. Trade depression had reacted on the customs revenue; the Egyptian customs officials had not proved an unqualified success—one had been dismissed while another had resigned ; efforts at retrenchment, and the imposition of certain minor taxes, produced no substantial result. ? A large increase in revenue could be secured only by an increase in the customs duty 7 from 3 per cent, to 10 per cent., and the existence of treaties between Muscat and 1 ranee and the (J.S.A., fixing that dutv at 5 per cent made action on these lines difficult.9 38. The Government of India endeavoured to meet the situation, to the seriousness of which the Sultan was fully alive, by lending for four months a highly qualified European customs official, Mr. Bower, to reorganise the Muscat customs. At the same time, they agreed, at the request of the Sultan, to find a competent Englishman to serve as Financial Adviser, look after the finances of the Slate, and aid His Highness and the Council with advice. The Arab Advisory Council established in 1920 (see para. 35) had proved of no real assistance—the Sultan in 1924 had complained that they were, “ though very worthy persons . . . absolutely useless as administrators, apart from which they would never come to a decision about any matter, even unimportant questions ” ; and the Political Resident agreed * Tei. 22 t. from that “the difficulty was to get them to give a decided opinion on any MarmTigL^ ° fI ’ SllbjeCt.” 0 P. 2028/2T’ 39. The post of Financial Adviser was offered to Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., formerly Assistant British representative in Trans-Jordania, wTio assumed duty in April 1925, and in 1926 was appointed Wazir and a member of the Muscat Advisory Council, functioning primarily as Finance Minister, but exercising also a full share in the general government of the State.f Mr. Thomas, who is the servant of the State and not of His t Letter 1 63 s. from Majesty’s Government, was engaged on a contract for five years, with ' ° f L ’ six months’ leave after three years, plus one month’s leave a year, and pay of P- 2077/26. Rs. 1,500—100—2,000. The terms of his service were approved by the •Government of India. p - 4289 / 24 - 40. The result of the steps referred to above has been a very marked improvement. By April 1925 the financial situation could be reported “ more satisfactory than it has been for some years ; by June the State was reported solvent, and despite^ fluctuations in trade which have been reflected in decrease of revenue, the improvement has been maintained. An extensive Public Works programme has been initiated, a patrol steamer has been secured, |j repayment of the State indebtedness has progressed satisfactorily ; in 1927 the Government of India felt justified in agreeing to the extension by 24 years of the period of repayment of the outstanding balance of the loan granted in 1919 (paras. 28 and 31) above, to enable the State to open a primary school and make other minor improvements, and in the same year the Political Resident was able to claim that His Majesty’s Government “have put the finances of the State on a sbund basis.”^[ The situation is the more satisfactory as the 200 miles of quite thickly inhabited coastline, and the powerful and often hostile hinterland, necessitate the maintenance by Muscat of establishments “ on a scale which would appear absurd in a place like Bahrein or Koweit.”** X Letter 102 S. from Pol.

The improvement referred to above has been secured for rather than by the Sultan, although Ilis Highness has on occasion shown a definite interest in the action taken.|t Sir L.

A critical stage has not been reached, although the local Amir ol Jaalan has set up an independent customs administration, but the Political Resident apprehends that should the Amir • endeavour to throw off his allegiance to the Sultan and establish an independent dominion similar to that of the Omanis of the interior, the very considerable reduction of the Sultan’s dominions and revenues which would be involved might necessitate active economic pressure by His Majesty’s ‘Government on the Sur tribes on behalf of His Highness.§§ 3064 B P. 1592/28. §§ Letter 167 S.from Pol.

Up to 17&lt;S3 the capital of Muscat and Oman was at Rastaq in the interior. Up to 1793 the temporal ruler, who was also the spiritual ruler of the country, had, in accordance with the tenets of the Ibadhi sect oi Islam, been elected by the people. The transfer of the capital to the coast of Muscat relieved the fanatical tribes of the interior of the direct control to which they had hitherto been subject, while the fact that from the usurpation of Saiyid Sultan in 1793 the formality of election had been dispensed with, enabled them to regard their nominal ruler as a usurper. The relations with heretical foreign Powers which followed the transfer of the capital and the progressive degeneration in the capacity of the ruling house by which that transfer was accompanied, further weakened the position of the Sultan vls-d-vis the Omani tribes; and a series of rebellions between 1829 and 1867 culminated in the temporary seizure of power (1868-71) by a representative of a younger branch of the ruling family supported by the tribes. 44. The usurper was overthrown in 1871 by the legitimate branch; but between that date and 1913 numerous attempts were made by the Omani tribes to dethrone the Sultans, whose survival as rulers may fairly be said to have been due solely to the support of His Majesty’s Government. In the years immediately before the war, tribal feeling was inflamed by the stoppage of the importation of arms, i:: ' following on the suppression of the slave trade, both of them measures permitted by Islam, at the instigation of Christian Powers; a carefully organised conspiracy followed, and in May 1913, in an outburst of religious fanaticism, the Omani tribes arose in rebellion.| 45. Reinforcements were despatched by His Majesty’s Government in fulfilment of a guarantee given to the Sultan in 1895, and then communicated to the Sheikhs of Oman, that they would not allow attacks to be made on Muscat or Muttrah whatever differences the Sultan might have with his tribes—a guarantee, the principle of which was extended in practice to the ports of the Batinah coast and to Kuryet, which contained resident British subjects. The warning in question was renewed, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government,f but produced no impression on the Omanis, and while in January lb 15 the crushing defeat of an attack in force on the British outposts stationed at Bnit-el-Falaj for the protection of Muscat and Mattrah taught the tribes their lesson, by 1916 the rebels had obtained complete control of all Oman proper, and had organised a Government in it; and they remained thereafter in undisputed possession of the interior, and a constant menace to the coast towns. These they would probably have taken had it not been for the British garrison at Bait-el-Falaj and the knowledge that the arrival of one of His Majesty’s ships would quickly have forced them to relinquish any hold which the} 7 might temporarily have established. 46. Thanks to the efforts of the Political Agent, a conference to consider terms of peace between the Sultan and the Imam of the Omani tribes took place at Sib on the 15th September 1915. It was completely abortive,§ the demands of the Sultan that the Wadi Samail and its forts (captured in August 1913, and essential to the commercial prosperity of Muscat)|j should be returned to him, and his temporal supremacy in Oman recognised, being categorically refused by the Omanis, who demanded on their part that the Sultan should reform his Government according to their ideas, that their financial claims should be settled in full, and that the free purchase of arms and ammunition should be allowed. No reconciliation proved possible, and the negotiations were broken off. 47. From the breaking off of the negotiations in September 1915, no further steps were taken towards a settlement until March 1918. The Imam consolidated his power in the interior, while the Sultan’s Government, according to the Political Agent, “became involved in hopeless debt and reached an unparalleled degree of ineptitude.” 48. Further abortive negotiations took place in March 1918, but there was no substantial advance until the following year. At the beginning of•) i-9 ( see paras. J9-30) tlie necessity of taking drastic measures to preserve the bultan s Government on ihe coast from complete collapse was recognised by the Government of India and Ilis Majesty’s Government; a loan from Indian revenues was made to Ilis Highness to enable him to put his house in 01 dei internally, and pressure was put on the Omani tribes through the Political Agent with a view to securing a settlement between them and the Sultan. After much correspondence, the Imam was persuaded to resume negotiations, and a meeting took place between him and the Political Agent at Sib on the 15th September 1919* 49. \ ery great difficulty was experienced in arriving at agreement. It was only alter negotiations had been broken off, and definite action taken to show not only that the support of the Sultan by His Majesty’s Government was a reality, but that the Sultan was in a position to retaliate effectively on the Omanis by the taxing of their produce when it came down to the coast for export, that any advance was secured. A British Adviser was appointed to the State,f a British warship, which actually inflicted punish ment at Masnaah,J was despatched to support the Sultan’s authority on the coast, and prohibitive duties were imposed on Omani produce, with the result that in July 1920 the Imam was murdered by his tribes,§ and that on 25th September 1920, after considerable further negotiation, agreement was reached between the conflicting parties. !| 50. Under the terms of settlement, the Sultan undertook^ not to interfere in the internal affairs of Oman ^no formal admission of Omani indepen dence being given); not to impose taxation in excess of 5 per cent, on commodities brought into the coast towns from Oman ; to allow members of the tribes to enter and leave Muscat and the coast towns in safety and freedom ; and to return fugitive criminals on demand. 51. 1 he tribes, on the other hand, contracted to remain in peace and amity with the Sultan’s Government, with which they were not to interfere; not to attack the coast towns ; to impose no restrictions on trade : to under take that travellers to Oman on their lawful business should be free and safe; to turn out fugitive criminals and evil-doers; and to dispose of the claims of merchants and others against them according to the Sharah law. 52. The agreement, which, as will be seen, involves recognition by the Sultan of the practical independence of the Omani tribes, has, on the whole, worked well since 1920. Action had to be taken in 1922 by His Majesty’s ships in support of the Muscat Government against one of the Omani tribes (the 5al Saad, on the Batmeh coasty, but, broadly speaking, the situation has stabilised itself, and the Omani tribes, while they would no doubt constitute an immediate menace were the support of His Majesty’s Govern ment withdrawn, have ceased, at any rate temporarily, to interfere with and harass the Sultan’s Government. V.—Foreign Relations of Muscat, 1908-1928. 53. During the first part of the period now under consideration, the existence of treaty relations between France and Muscat was, as will be seen from paras. 7-16 above, of the first importance from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic. It is unnecessary to enter into the details of the relations between the two countries, since the substantial consideration which led to French interest in Muscat disappeared with the amicable settlement reached between His Majesty’s Government and the French Government on the suppression of the aims tiaffic in 1 ebruary 1914. But the settlement in question did not involve the abrogation of the French Treaty with Muscat of 1844 or of the Anglo-French Declaration of 18(32, and the continued existence of these instruments is of sufficient importance in present circumstances to call for brief notice in this Memorandum. 54. As will be seen from the precis of the Muscat Treaties referred to in para. 2 abo\e, the Sultan of Muscat has a Commercial Treaty with France dating from 1844.

This latter difficulty is of importance at the present time in view of the revival by the Political Resident of the proposal for the establishment of a British naval base at Khassab in the Musandim Peninsula (see paras. 65 to 71 below). 55. It is unnecessary to enter into the history of the efforts made between 1910 and 1914, in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic, to secure French concurrence in the abrogation of the Declaration of 1862 and possibly of the Treaty of 1844. Suffice it to say that it proved impracticable to arrive at an agreement which could be confined to Muscat, or even to Muscat and the French possessions in India! ; that France was not prepared to cede her rights in return for territorial acquisitions in India alone! ; that the Government of India were reluctant to agree to any cession of Indian territory, save in return for a corresponding acquisition of French territory in India (Chandernagore and the Loges); and that proposals of compensation in other parts of the world by the cession of Gambia, the rectification of the Desert Boundary between the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and French Equatorial Africa, or by the grant to the French Government of certain concessions in North Africa, came to nothing. 56. The position, therefore, is that French rights persist in their entirety. On the other hand, for the last 14 years no matter of dispute between the French Government and His Majesty’s Government has arisen in Muscat; the Muscat dhows flying the French flag had fallen by 1920 to seven, of which two only belonged to French subjects^; and French interests in the affairs of the Sultanate has shown a progressive decrease, although a Consulate is still maintained by France. In 1920-1 the French Government relinquished the coal depot at Mokalla,|| which had been granted them at the time of the Bander Gisseh incident of 1899 dealt with in Mr. Parker’s memorandum, and in 1928 the Political Resident^ stated that he gathered from the French Consul (at Bushire?) that “ France no»v takes very little interest in Muscat and is now considering closing down permanently the Consulate, which has not been held by any incumbent for some years.” 57 57. While, however, France may no longer actively concern herself with Muscat affairs, so long as the engagements referred to in para. 54 remain in being His Majesty’s Government cannot be regarded as free agents in respect of Muscat, even though practical control may rest with them and all external expenditure on the State be financed by them. On a broad view the interests of His Majesty’s Government would probably best be served by the abrogation of both instruments, and it is possible that, at some later stage, if French interest in Muscat diminishes to vanishing point, the French Government might be willing to consider the extinction of their rights as part of an arrangement which would also dispose of the Ion ^-standing question of the French Loges in India itself, without demandino- an unreasonable quid pro quo. But it cannot be overlooked that the *1862 Declaration, inconvenient as it may be in certain ways to His Majesty’s Government, is of value as constituting a certain check on designs on Muscat by other Powers. From a different standpoint, its existence, taken with that777 13 ■r of the Treaty of 1814, is an assurance to the Sultan, the value of which was certainly fully appreciated by his predecessor, that he will not suffer the fate of Zanzibar. 58. The United States of America, despite their Treaty of 1833 with 'Muscat, appear in practice to have no relations of any importance with that State, their interests in which are now entrusted to His Majesty’s Government.^ No question affecting these relations arose during the period now under consideration. Here, however, as in the case of France, the guarantees embodied in the Treaty of 1833 would make it impossible for the Sultan to increase his customs duty (the most important method of raising revenue at his disposal) without the prior concurrence of the United States Government (cp. para. 37 above). 59. No question affecting the relations between the Sultan and the Dutch Government arose during the period in question, and those relations appear, as in the case of the United States Government, to be entirely unimportant. Under the Commercial Declaration of 1877 Holland is, however, entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment, and so would be affected by any modification of the customs duties. 60. The possibility of the development of a German interest in Muscat was of interest to His Majesty’s Government in the years before the war. The present Sultan was informed in 1913 that His Majesty’s Government could not agree to direct correspondence between him and the German Consul, a practice contrary to the practice of Sultan Faisal, who had referred to His Majesty’s Government matters affecting Powers unrepresented at Mu scat. | The danger of the acquisition by Germany of a foothold in Muscat through the grant to Muscatis of German certificates of nationality, was prominently before His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in 1914. To prevent the establishment of a precedent which could be quoted by Germany, arrangements were made that the British flag should not be granted to Muscat subjects in British East Africa unless a “no objection’’certificate had first been secured from the Sultan through the Political Agent,J and the question of securing the Sultan’s approval to an edict which would have made his personal consent a condition of the transfer of allegiance by an Omani to a foreign State was under consideration at the outbreak of the war.§ The difficulty which would be presented by a German request to the signatories of the Joint Declaration of 1862 for their concurrence in the conclusion of a direct German Commercial Treaty with Muscat (on the basis of which a political connection could be developed), were brought to the attention of Government bv the Political Resident in July 1914. * Tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I., Oct, 29 1920, P. 7936/20. f Tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I Dec. 31 1913, P. 1/14 ; F.O. to I.O., Jan. 9 1914, P. 139.

No question of importance as between Persia and Muscat has arisen during the period now in question. It may be recorded that in the autumn of 1914, on the request of the Persian Government, the Political Agent was instructed to exercise his good offices on behalf of Persian subjects in Muscat should an appeal be made to him, and in all serious cases of hardship and Nov 4 \ i} n ^ ’ oppression.^ p - * 59 ‘R l&gt; - 2924/14 The report recently received from Sir Lionel Haworth that instructions Td. from p&lt;&gt;i. pes. had been issued by the Persian Government to the Governor of Bushire that ^ s 5&lt; of p • Persia can recognise no rulers on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and that ‘ ’ persons belonging to and arriving from Muscat (as from the other principalities on the Arab littoral) are to be considered Persian subjects, and Persian passports issued to them, necessitates, however, a brief reference to the possible basis of a Persian claim to suzerainty over Muscat. So far r j0 r. 1 . 399 . as can be traced, the only two incidents in the past on which any such claim Lor - L 400 - 7 . could be based are the fact that for a few months in 1623 Persia occupied Sohar and Khor Fakkan and that from 1737 until her expulsion in 1744 she was in occupation of Muscat. It is impossible as yet to estimate the importance which should be attached to the report referred to above, of which no confirmation is available from other sources. Any Persian claim of the14 * Cp. letter 205 from Pol. Res. to G. of I., Jan. 19 1913, P. 4487/13. t G. of I. Secret Deep. 108. Gen., to S. of S for I., Oct. 16 1913. P. 1487/13. X G. of I.

The fact that Muscat is in treaty relations of long standing, not only with His Majesty’s Government but with other first-class Powers, and that those treaty relations are based on the recognition by the Powers in question of the complete independence of the State, would further strengthen the Sultan’s position against any claim at this stage to suzerainty by Persia. Relations between Muscat and Ibn Saud. G2. Ibn Saud is a growing influence on the Trucial Coast, but he has not so far come very directly in contact .with Muscat, to the independence of which he constitutes at the moment a less immediate menace than is the case on the Trucial Coast. VI.—Miscellaneous Questions. (a) The Muscat Order in Council. (b) Establishment of a British Naval Base on the Musandim Peninsula. (c) Cession of Gwadur. (d) Oil in Muscat. (a) The Muscat Order in Council—1867 and 1915. 03. From 1867 the jurisdiction exercised over British subjects in Muscat by the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul was exercised under the Muscat Order in Council of 1867. ::i The revision of this Order, which had become out of date, was raised l;w the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in 1913. His proposals that the revision should be undertaken were accepted by the Government of Indiaf and His Majesty’s Government, and a revised Order in Council in substitution for the Order of 1867 was approved by His Majesty on the 3rd February 1915. The new Order, which came into force on the 1st January 1916,j vests in the Political Agent, subject to the general control of, and right of appeal to, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, jurisdiction over— (a) British subjects, and British ships, with their boats, and persons and property on board, or belonging to them, within the limits of the Order. (b) Muscat subjects registered in the Political Agency as in the regular service of British subjects, subject to a proviso as to the disposal of cases in which such Muscat subjects are concerned. (c) The property, &amp;c., of all British subjects and of the Muscat subjects referred to in ( 6 ), whether within or without the limits of the Order. (d) Foreigners, with respect to whom any State, &amp;c., the subjects, or under the protection, of which they are has agreed by treaty to the exercise of power or authority by His Majesty. (e) Muscat subjects and foreigners, other than those referred to in (b) and (d) in certain specified cases. The limits of the Order are the territories and territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 64. Various regulations, &amp;c., have since 1916 been issued under the new Order, certain amendments in which were approved by His Majesty in Council in 1922,§ but no question of importance has arisen in connection with its working. (b) Proposal for the establishment of a British Naval Base in the Musandim Peninsula. 65. The earlier history of this proposal, which appears first to have been made by Sir Lewis Pelly, then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in 1863, is given in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, and in Lorimer’s Persian Gulf Gazetteer, Vol. I, pp. 251 to 258. 66 . The question was again raised in 1913. In a Note communicated to the Committee of Imperial Defence on 17th January 1913, the Admiralty expressed the view that it was “ essential that any naval station that may be15 a 3k lleC . 1 ^ i^ e mou ^ ^ le ^ u lf) “ should not be either at Bunder '! s °?. 011 ^ 0 a( B a cent islands, but on the Ras Musandim promontory or the Arabian shore. There would otherwise be risk of our being driven bv mi i ar) oi ce rom our necessary naval base. Moreover, the only anchorages which can be trusted are on the Arabian shore.” % (&gt;7 - Almost simultaneously the Political Resident had suggested that i might be desirable to choose Ras Musandim as a site for a lighthouse in preference to Little Quoin,- and the Government of India, in the light of the expression of the views of the Admiralty quoted above, were prepared to agiee to the substitution “apart from the considerations arising from the Anglo-Irench Declaration of ]862.”t bS In April 1913 the Government of India reported that the Director, Royal Indian Marine, saw technical objections to the selection of Musandim as the site_ for a lighthouse on the grounds that “thick weather over Musandim is the rule rather than the exception . . . further . . . worst tides experienced anywhere in the Gulf and its approaches are found round Musandim Island. ^ay the Admiralty expressed the view that “ while a naval base on the Musandim Peninsula would theoretically be in a somewhat better strategical position for the control of a railway passing along the northern shoie of the entiance to the Gulf, if threatened by a hostile advance from the north-west, practical considerations point rather for the present to the use of Hen jam . . . with Basidu as a subsidiary base. It does not appear necessary to contemplate the actual fortification of a naval base in this region so long as we retain the command of the sea in Eastern waters.”§ This disposed of the question of a station on Musandim; and it was agreed that the lighthouse in contemplation should be erected on Little Quoin as beino - preferable from the strictly navigational standpoint. * Tel. from Pol.

There appear to have been no developments until in February 1927 the Political Resident]| indicated that Khassab was of value, not merely in || Desp. 4 from Pol connection with the air route, on which it would constitute a jumpino-off Res. to o. of 1 ., ground for Gwadur on the Makran coast, but for strategical reasons, since l*nil' 927 ’ “ the country possessing it can practically command egress from and ingress t° fhe Persian Gulf.” Sir L. Haworth therefore favoured the purchase of Khassab from Muscat, possibly for about £•12,000, and the establishment of ‘ a Gibraltar at the head of the Gulf.” He regarded this as practicable vis-a-vis^ France, in view of the right of pre-emption enjoyed bv Plis Majesty’s Government under the Exclusive Agreement of 1891. rl. Ko views have been expressed on the subject by the Government of India. With the Persian challenge to the position of His Majesty’s Govern ment in Basidu and Henjam the possibility of establishing, if not a fortified base, at any rate a station, in the Musandim Peninsula or on one of the adjoining islands, on two of which (Telegraph Island and Sheep Island) the British Hag has for a short period been hoisted in the past, becomes of more immediate importance. But, financial and strategical considerations apart, the extent to which His Majesty’s Government are free agents vis-d-vis 1 rance &gt; w ^ 10 ’ though aware of, is not a party to, and has never formally recognised, the Exclusive Agreement of 1891, will call for careful examina tion before a decision can be taken. '(c) The Cession of Gwadur. 72. It was decided in 1863 after exhaustive examination that no attention # HACl/U Cit toil null need or could be paid to the claims to Gwadur, a dependency of Muscat in Makran, on the Persian littoral of the Gulf, of the Khan of Kalat or of t f„.„, (i the Gitchkis.

The question of its retransfer to Kalat at a price was raised bv the Political Agent, Muscat, in 1921, when the financial situation of Muscat was critical, but the Government of India were instructed** that no overtures should be made to the Sultan of Muscat without prior reference to His Majesty’s Government, and the matter dropped. ** Tel. 1176 from S. of S. for I. to Viceroy, Sept. 1 1920 ; Viceroy to S. of S, for I., 1182 S., Oct. 9 1920.16 1 l Desp. to G. of I., Feb. 19 1927, F. 1575.

The geographical position of Gwadur would lend it considerable importance in the event of an air route being establis it( a ong ie north Arabian coast, and the Political Kesident in February 192v proposed that it should be purchased outright for, say, £ 135 , 000 , or abou purchase of the present customs revenue (Us. 11b,000 in 10-6, say ys. a v 1 after deduction of expenses of collection) as a British possession, ie Khan of Kalat being compensated lor his claim out of the amount in No opinion ou the matter has been expressed by the Goveimnen^ But, as in the case of Khassab and the Musandim 1 romontoiy above), the extent to which His Majesty’s Government are tree question, of India, (para. 71 agents vis d-vis France would decision could be taken even objection on other grounds. need very careful were the proposal examination before a held to be free from (d) Oil in Muscat. 75 The Sultan undertook in February 1923 not to exploit any oil which might be found in his territories, or to grant permission for its exploitation, without prior consultation with the Political Agent, and the approval of the Government of India. An oil concession was secured from j 11 ® Hl f hne ^’ with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, by t ie * n A 0 eismn Company in 1925. (The general question of oil m tne Gulf is dealt vuth m the Memorandum by the Board of Irade on p. HI.) VII.—Summary. 76 The last 20 years have seen the practical elimination of French influence in Muscat and the consolidation of the influence of His Majesty s Government. Despite the fact that the Sultanate is independent, a ven close degree of indirect control has been established; the succession has been regulated ; the customs administration has been brought under the management of officials recommended by the Government of India, a European adviser, a servant indeed of the Sultan, but recommended and selected by the Government of India, and working in close and friendly co-operation with the Political Agent, is the mainspring of the adminis tration; the arms traffic has disappeared, and, thanks _ to the active intervention, both political and otherwise, of ihs Majesty s Government a working arrangement has been reached with the rebellious inhes ot the interior of Oman. The main difficulties which at the moment conlront the State are the instability of the Sultan s character, and the possi n ity that before a suitable successor is available he may renew his desire to abdicate; the financial situation, which is complicated by the need loi expenditure on essential improvements, the fact that the main source ol additional revenue—increase of customs duties—cannot without great difficulty be tapped, and the necessity of repayment to the Government ot India of the balance of the loan made to the State in 1319 : and the problem, the importance of which cannot at this stage be appraised, but which may not prove to be serious, of the attitude of the tribes of k_ur. 77. The direct intervention in the affairs of Muscat of His Majesty’s Government lias been very definitely in the interests of the State, and, so far as those interests are concerned, it is desirable that it should be maintained. At the same time, so long as the treaties at present in force between the Sultan and the Governments of France, Holland and the united states continue to subsist, there can be no question ol the establishment of a formal protectorate,even should wider objections of principle not be held to militate against the acceptance of such a policy. r , T . + , From the narrower point of view ol the interests of i lls Majesty s Government and the Government of India, there is no less advantage in a maintenance of the status quo, under which control in everything but name i VSts with I lis Majesty’s Government. With the gradual elimination oi British authority from the south Persian coast and with the adoption, for however long it may be maintained, of an active policy in the Gulf by Persia, the strangle hold on the Gulf which the effective control of Muscat constitutes has assumed •n, importance more espeeiallv in view of British commitments in Iraq, which it KotTn the past present. Moreover, not only is effective, if veiled,17 77 'control of Muscat the point d appui of the consolidation of British influence on the noith Arabian littoral, but the danger, in its absence, of active foreign interest in the State cannot be overlooked, while should it ultimately prove that the difficulties in the way of an Imperial air route through Persian territory aie insupeiable, Muscat, with its dependency Gwadur, may prove to be of great impoitance for air reasons. Prom the naval point of view, should a decision lav omable to the establishment of a naval base in the Musandim Peninsula at any stage be taken, and should it prove possible to reconcile the acquisition of a site for such a base with the terms of the .Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, the principality would acquire an additional importance. 78. To sum up. The predominant influence in Muscat of His Majesty’s Govei nment is in the interest ol the State itself. The commitments involved in its maintenance are not, in existing circumstances, heavy, though the presence ol a British Adviser and the exclusion of foreign interference imposes on His Majesty s Government a measure of responsibility lor the progress, or lack of progress, of the State. The predominant influence of His Majestv’s Government is equally, and more especially in present circumstances, an Imperial interest, whether from the commercial or the strategical standpoint. It can be maintained without undue “Westernisation,” and, while it caii never be popular with the fanatical tribes of the interior, its withdrawal is unlikely to be desired so long as the country internally remains divided as it has been lor many years, and so long as no ruler arises with a personality so outstanding as to show himself capable of disposing effectively, single- handed, of the problems presented by the government of his State. Points referred to in connection with Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 79. The points in connection with Muscat which have been specifically mentioned in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub- •Committee are as follow :— . (1) Is the maintenance of the independence of Muscat (which is also threatened, though less immediately, by Ibn Saud) necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured ?' (P.G. 3 (viii).) (2) Steps necessary on the north Arabian coast in connection with slavery and the arms traffic. (P.G. 6, 2 (c) 3.) (o) Extent to which British influence is to be maintained in Muscat: question of relations between the Sultan and the Amirs of Jaalan (Sur): position vis-d-vis the French. (P.G. 6, 2 (c) 5.) IX.—Views expressed by Government of India. SO. The Government of India have expressed the view that “the maintenance of independence of Muscat, Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Chief is necessary. Our veiled protectorate over them suffices against Tel. from viceroy European encroachments. So long as we do not alienate Arab opinion by to s. of s. for i.. attempting undue Westernisation, it suffices also against encroachments by Xso p.a 9. the \\ ahabi State. At need it can be more explicitly asserted.” India Office, 25th August 1928. J. G.

The early correspondence concerns efforts to prevent Taimur from abdicating and to improve Muscat's flagging economy. Once the abdication is accepted several questions are raised and discussed, including:the suitability of a successor and the arrangements for the accession of his son, Saidwhether to continue both the Arms Traffic and Zanzibar Subsidy payments (this question is raised again in 1948)the renegotiation of Muscat's treaties with the French, Americans, and the tribes of Oman's interiorwhether to continue Taimur's personal allowanceSultan Said's changes to governmentFurther correspondence within the file deals with the following matters:requests for statistical information about Muscat from the Danish government for their yearbook in 1934 and 1935a plea from Kamile Ilgiray, an ex-wife of former Sultan Taimur, to the British Government for help with her son's educationthe question of the best time to inform the French, American, and Dutch governments of Sultan Said's successionthe whereabouts of former Sultan Taimur, including his visits to Saudi Arabia in 1933 and Japan in 1939.The majority of the correspondence is between the Political Agent in Muscat, Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Government of India (Foreign Department), India Office, and Foreign Office.
