However, a receipt will be obtained from the Company and forwarded in due course. 4* The necessary certificate is enclosed.5 Fleas* see paragraph 2 above* It was considered that the general certificate attached to the bill was sufficient to support the claim; however, a separate certificate is enclosed* The charges are based on the cost of the hire of a Motor Launch, sufficiently to carry tv.#* load, ^rom the shore to th&lt;? ship and return, s Journey of over % rollcsr i have the honour to - e lour i.ioct obuuient aor^nt.

To The Hon‘ble the Politiegl-Resident in the,P ersi an Gulf ( C&amp;mp Brhr ain). Subject : TreveliinR Allowance on transfers , Sir, I have tne honour to say that in the case of the transfer to the Persian Gulf of Mr. G.N. Jackson, As istent Political Agent, Bahrain, and Mr. C.Felly, Pclitical Officer, Trucial Corst, the Accountant-General Central Revenues has objected to cashing their bills for three fares, and contends that two only are admissible. 2. He quotes correction slij No.406 to o.R.j44, by which a Government servant returning to the Persian Gulf, whose joining time falls under sub-section (d) of F.R.IjS (i.e. return from leave or other purpose than that covered by sub section (a)), may only draw two steamer fares instead of three. o. The joining time of a Government servant on transfer posting to the Persian Gulf,falls under sub-section (a) of F.R. 105; and it is quite obvious from a reading of F.R. 106 that its four sub-sections visualise four different types of eventuality. 4. The Accountant-General Central Revenues, hcrever, contends that the joining time of a Government servant on transfer to Persian Gulf falls under the heeding of both sub-section (a) and sub-section (d)(i); end therefore, (presumably a some generally conci^ved principle of the ' whichever is less” variety) has refused to sanction the third steamer fare for Messrs Jickson and Felly.- 2 - 5. It is inconceivable that the intention of the Government of India, when sanctioning the issue of the correction slip to S.R.144, really was to discriminate unfairly against Government servants who are obliged to travel by steamer, and incidentally pay considerable sums for dockyard and loading facilities, and for the±r daily messing on board - fares 'without food' only being provi ded. Had such been their intention, the,y would, I take it, have amended the main rule, S.R.ii6 I,which is the rule properly applicable in cases of permanent transfer. 6. I need not, I think, stress the unfortunate effect it must have if a Government servant realizes that, if he receives an appointment in the Persian Gulf, he will begin his service there by having to drew in part on his own resources in order to proceed to his new station.

His efforts, however, to find a suitable man with some training to hold the newly created post of the compounder failed and therefore the temporary arrangements mentioned in para graph 3 of my memorandum No,1361-1^/226 dated the 6th October 1939, were allowed to continue, 3, In the meantime, the Medical Officer Dubai forwarded a petition from the Dispenser at Dubai for an increment of fis.16/-. The Political Officer, Trucial Coast Sharjah and the Residency Surgeon, Bushire, however, recommended an increment of Rs,6/- only and this was granted by the Political Agent Bahrain in view of the saving of Es.10/- p.m, • resulting from the caving offeeted threwgh keeping him on Ss,30/- instead of recruiting a compounder on Bs.40/-. 4, It is regretted that the point was overlooked at the time that the increment should not have been granted without prior sanction of the Government of India and in order to regularise the position, I request that the Government of India would give retrospective sanction to the payment to the Dispenser of the enhanced rate^pay of Es,30/-p.m, with effect from 1st June 1940 to the 30th November 1941, The post / of the •••• \ \ MFP— 1211 S&amp;P-(M-2312)—7-5-41—400,000. / /2 of the Dispenser was abolished and that of the Compounder at Es.40/- p*nu created with effect from 1st December 1941.

In the present case there is no doubt as to the fact of overdrawal. The question of refund only remains. I think it is incorrect (in fact highly objectionable) not to take any steps directly to rectify the error.or if-Heee&amp;sary-Apart from the less important consideration of explanation for the overdrawal it is, I humbly submit, very important for the Drawing Officer to take some sort of action once the fact of overpayment of Government money has been brought to his notice and not to leave it tb the Accounts Office to detect it and order a refund, with the possible c hance of the overpayment esca ping his notice altogether, though this rarely happens. I suggest we credit the amount in cash(under a chalan from 'P.A.' giving details of the voucher concerned)' - e-e-fap-as by short-remittance of his leave salary to Mr.Nasirul Haq. As regards the overpayment to Mr.Rss Masaud (My Note of 9.2.42 below), we might effect a refund by short-drawal in the next paybill of establishment, as his leave salary has already been remitted to him pi. :/j- • /yt ^ ' [(L, .'x / o ^ yL ^ ^ fU&gt;vy y. /u: ,^4- ^ u XUcsiO &amp;3. 4. has been pa A^O- _ SF- lL f - ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ tA ^ /tz 4-&amp;1 CA , / ^ y Para (ii), for a certifyicate to the eff e May write to BushireZ^hat the possession of a motor car by the A.P.A, is advantageous from the point of view of his efficiency? D.F.A. Para (iii). It seems original railway receipts were sent with the T.A.bill concerned. The only explanations of the discrepancy between the amount charged by the Railway Department and that arrived at by the A.G-.C.R. can be either (a) that the goods were actually transported by i nstead of a goods train/ a passenger train,^as the Accounts Officer thinks or (b) that there has been an overcharge by the Railway Deptt. If former, the higher rate of payment is covered by Note 1 below' S.R.116 (a) I (iii), which says that as long as the amount actually paid is within the maximum a. admissible (which in this^/is that for 40 maunds of luggage) it does not matter whether the personal effects are carried by a passenger train or a goods train. If there has been an overcharge on the part of the Railway, perhaps we might suggest the A.G.C.R. settling the point direct with the Stationmaster,Quetta, as the amount claimed was actually paid by you and the original receipts for the payment have been sent in support of the claim. The overcharge of Re.17/7/ objected to by the AGCR on account of cartage from Karachi station to Kiamari seems is not admissible under the rules. The fact that actually an amount higher than that admissible under rules does not justify its claim in full.in the T,A.bill. The Treasury Rules require that a Retrenchment Order from the Accounts Office should be carried out without waiting for any doubtful points between the Officer affected and the Accounts Office to be settled.
