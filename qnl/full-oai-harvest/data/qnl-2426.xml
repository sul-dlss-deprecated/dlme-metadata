(ff 2-12).The second part of the file consists of copies of correspondence exchanged between India Office and Foreign Office officials in London during July to September 1944, in response to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf’s recommendations for canteen facilities at Sitrah Island for US seamen, with the proviso that US seamen do not attempt to enter the towns of Manama or Muharraq. This correspondence also discusses a request from the US Department of State (relayed through the US Embassy in London, f 18) for the appointment of a non-American with legal qualifications to act as a judge over US citizens in Bahrain; a request that, in the eyes of India and Foreign Office officials, challenges Britain’s right of jurisdiction over all foreigners at Bahrain (ff 13-24).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>United States Naval Observer, Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>United States Navy</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sitrah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Merchant shipping</topic></subject><subject><topic>Merchant seamen</topic></subject><subject><topic>Jurisdiction</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum products</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00008c#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00008c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
