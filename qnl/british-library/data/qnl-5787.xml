To the Chairman of the Commercial Intelligence Committee. Sib, London, 12th April 1904. I have the honour to submit herewith a Report on the Trade of Oman prepared after a visit to Muscat in the month of February 1904, in accordance with your instructions. Other ports in Oman are in great measure de pendent on the coasting trade with Muscat and Gulf ports visited by ocean steamers, and did not appear to me to promise sufficient matter of general interest to reward the somewhat protracted journey which visits to them would have involved. On leaving Muscat the proximity of Bahrein induced me to visit that place whence I returned to Karachi via Bushire and Koweit. In the course of the voyage I had opportunities to gather from merchants and others some impression of the trade at ports on the Pirate Coast, although I was not able to land at any of them. I have included in my Report notes on these places. I gratefully acknowledge the kindly welcome and willing assistance accorded to me by H.B.M. Consular Officers, merchants, and other residents in Oman and the Gulf Ports. I have, &amp;c. E. W. Maclean. OMAN. Muscat is the capital and principal port of the Sultanate of Oman. Caravans cannot readily approach it, and commerce with the interior passes through Mutra, lying in an adjacent bay. The population of these two towns may be 30,000, and that of the territory of Oman has been estimated at ^00,000, chiefly Arabs. There are^ British, French, and American Consuls, the last named being a British subject representing a trading firm and a^ent for the British India Steam Navigation Company; a French trader; a Russian trader; and British Indian subjects to the number of about 1,100. The climate is tropical, dry with intense heat in summer, but pleasant during four winter months. Statistics of Imports and Exports at Muscat are given in the Annual Trade Reports to the Indian Government of the Political Agent at Muscat. These statistics do not include merchandise carried in native sailing crafttrading from the smaller ports of Oman. There lias been no marked increase or decrease of trade in recent years. Total Imports (excluding specie). Average for three years to 1900 Do. do. 1903 246.000 per annum. 253.000 . Total Exports (excluding specie). Average for three years to 1900 - - 127,000 per annum. Do. do. 1903 - - - 119,000 Imports. Arms and Ammunition are imported direct from Europe. The Trade in 1895-6 amounted to only 16,000^. The imports in subsequent years have been:— 1896-7. 1897-8. 1898-9. 1899-1900. 1900-1. 1901-2. 1902-3.

There is no restriction imposed by the Sultan of Muscat on the impor tation or sale of these articles, but British and British Indian subjects participating in this trade at Muscat must furnish to the Poltical Agent the names and addresses of parties to whom they sell. This discourages them from engaging in the trade, for it is probable that legitimate sales made by them will be run by subsequent buyers in contraband to pro hibited ports. Purchasers naturally prefer to deal with other traders, on whom similar regulations are not imposed, and the import from France and Belgium through Marseilles is consequently steadily increasing, while import from the United Kingdom is declining. This trade gives large profits in Muscat, and a French and a Russian trader are enabled to run businesses which, but for the regulation referred to, they would have difficulty in retaining in competition with our own traders. A recent consignment, mostly carbines, is reported to have been sold off at over Rs. 60 each piece (with 100 rounds ammunition), the cost c.i f. Muscat, being estimated at Rs. 35. The traffic in arms is not now an important business, but by leaving it to foreign competitors we give them an opening to settle in Muscat, and being there, perhaps to take part in other business which alone would not afford them maintenance Grain and Provisions .—Rice is consumed by all classes, and with other grains, spices, and coffee, forms the principal trade with India. Persia has ^ r-' ~ J 7 ~ X v XIA' • J. V7A old. JUL&amp;o usually supplied wheat, but owing to bad harvests in that country for some years past recourse has been had to India. Loaf sugar is little used, and soft sugar from Austria has held the market until recently, but Russian bag sugar, for which some orders have recently been placed through Bombay, is now offered at lower rates (about 11s. 6d. per cwt.), and appears likely to secure the market. Cane sugar is imported from Mauritius and India, but is not a large trade. Textiles .—White shirtings are all of Manchester manufacture, but in greys the Indian mills supply a fair part, and American unbleached sheetings have a steady market. In printed cotton goods the demand is for cheap light Manchester fabrics, check and stripe patterns predominating. Indigo dyed shirtings are in some demand for the mournin O' month of3 Muharrem, which at present begins in March. Nativ r o weaving industries are of little account, and the trade in yarns is not important. lor woollen and silk goods there is only a limited demand. A few articles of continental manufacture, probably from Bombay, are found in the bazaars of Muscat, but no information was obtained of direct business with the continent. Exports. Dates are the principal produce, and are sent down to the coast ports, where they are purchased and packed by the exporters. To fix the value for payment of customs duty all dates are auctioned on arrival at Mutra, and certain taxes and fines due from the proprietors in the interior are levied along with the duty. The ruling price in Muscat at the close of the packing season this year (January 1904) was 820 mahmoodieh per “bar. ” The “lard” dates are mostly exported to America, where there is a steady demand for this kind only. Statistics show a steady increase in export of dates, but the rainfall has failed in Oman during the last five years, and the palms are said to have suffered. A few other fruits, particularly dried limes, are exported to India and Persia. Colton, of good quality is said to have been formerly grown with success, but is not now exported. Pearls and Bahrein is now the headquarters of the pearl fishing industry in these regions, and little business in either pearls or shells is done in Muscat. An oyster-bed is said to exist off the island of Masorah, beyond Sur, from which fine pearls were formerly obtained. Fish .—There is a regular trade to India in sun-dried and salted fish, but no organised effort has been made to develop this industry, in which a good trade might be done. The waters of Oman abound in excellent fish,°and Muscat harbour swarms with sardines and a sort of whitebait (matoot). ^ he goldfish, tunny, and ray are abundant. The fishermen use both line and net, and wages are very low. Coinage. The Maria Theresa dollar is the usual medium of exchange in Oman. Specie operations in this coin are worked through Bombay. The only coin struck in the name of the Sultan is a copper pice (Janna), which has been issued in excess, and circulates at a fluctuating value to the inconvenience of the public, the present rate being 260 pice per ’ollar. The rupee is well known in the coast ports, anl is current for many transactions in Muscat but does not penetrate far into the interior. The ratio of the rupee to the dollar (about Rs. 220 per $100 before the Indian Mints were closed to free silver) has been recently 130 to 140 rupees per 100 dollars, in January 1904 Rs. 131 per $ 100. Prices are often quoted in mahmoodieh, a money of account only; 20 gad equal I mahmoodi, and 11J mahmoodieh equal one dollar. Weights. The Muscat man equals 237 tolah (2§ tolahs=l oz. troy). 24 kias = 1 Muscat man. 3 Muscat mans= 1 Delhi man. 10 „ „ = 1 Erasla. 200 „ „ = 1 Bar. . The kias is said to equal 6 reals or dollars in weight. There is also a bazaar man of 136 reals. Freight. Muscat is the only port of Oman at which steamers call. There is a weekly passenger and cargo service both to and from Bombay via Karachi by4 the British India Steam Navigation Company’s Persian Gulf line. Average freight is Rs. 10 per ton, weight or measurement. The direct British lines to the Persian Gulf frequently call at Muscat on the outward trip—freight usually the same as for Gulf ports, or an average of 35s per ton. Arms are shipped direct from England and Marseilles at about 61. per ton freight. Native sailing craft are now employed chiefly in the coasting trade, except - from the port of Sur, where the Arab owners maintain a trade, only inferior to that of Muscat, with India and the African coast as far as Zanzibar, and even with Mauritius. Course of Trade. Quite four-fifths of the trade of Muscat is with India, and in the hands of British Indian subjects working through partners or agents in Bombay. In dents for Manchester or other home goods are sent to those agents, who place orders with shipping firms in Bombay (payment against bill of lading), and draw on Muscat at 21 days, plus commission (say 2 per cent). Cotton tissues and other manufactures suited to the climate and condition of the people of Oman can be supplied largely from goods which are already manufactured for the Indian market, but the demand is of limited extent, and traders state, l think with reason, that for the small indents made for any one commodity it is more advantageous to place orders with Bombay shippers probably dealing in large quantities of the same goods, than to deal direct with houses in Great Britain. The consignment of perhaps only a few bales is either transhipped on arrival in Bombay at once to Muscat, or if landed in India on declaration of re-export pays 1 per cent, transit duty (plus J per cent, agent’s commission) The Muscat trader sells locally in rupees or dollars, usually payable in instalments concluded in about three months. Sales to the interior are in dollars cash, delivery in Muscat, or frequently on credit to be liquidated by consignments of dates or other produce in their seasons. Oman has commercial treaties with Great Britain, France, and other Powers. I summarise the conditions of greatest interest to traders:— Foreign merchants have liberty to trade and reside in the country, and purchase or rent lands, houses, and godowns, and to import or export any article of commerce. All imports are subject to Customs duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem. Exports are not subject to duty. Merchandise imported into Muscat under declaration of re-export by the same owner within six months is not subject to duty in transit. Dates and other produce from the interior are charged 5 per cent, duty on arrival at the Customs Stations at the Coast ports. This charge does not seem to be in keeping with treaty obligations, but is not complained of by our traders as a serious question, as traders of all nationalities submit to it. The Customs were formerly farmed out at an annual rental, latterly amounting to $ ,000, but since November 1899 have been administered for account of the Sultan, with the result, it is believed, of an increase of revenue. There are Customs ports at Muscat, Mutra, Sur, and other smaller ports, but the control exercised elsewhere than at Muscat and Mutra is lax and only nominal at Sur, which serves the most populous and fertile districts of the Sultanate and is the port next in importance to Muscat. The Arab traders of Sur, many of them flying the French flag pay only nominal duties, and consequently can afford to sell cheaper in inland markets than the British Indian traders of Muscat. The development of trade with Oman is retarded by the insecurity of life and property inland. Merchandise is forwarded by large caravans with not less than 10 men in charge, under safe conduct of a man from each district traversed. The authority of the Sultan is little more than nominal beyond the Coast ports, and tribal feuds and raids discourage agriculture and industry in the interior.The simple wants and general poverty of the people offer only a limited field to foreign trade. Regular steamer service from Europe and India to Gulf ports has decreased the coasting trade formerly centring in Muscat. The inland frontiers, apparently bounded in great part by deserts, afford no access to more distant markets. Xiittle seems to be known of the mineral resources of the interior, but some hold the country to be capable of considerable agricultural development. Behind the forbidding rock-bound coast there are reported to be wide and fertile valleys with fair water supplies from the inland mountain ranges. When law and security take the place of the disorder which now prevails in the interior, there may be considerable increase in cultivation and industry, and consequently in purchasing capacity of foreign commodities. BAHREIN, The population of the two islands under the rule of the Sheikh of Bahrein is said to be about 70,000. Manameh is the capital and commercial centre. Foreign residents are—the Assistant Political Agent to H. B. M. Resident at Bushire, numerous British Indian subjects, an American mission with staff of five or six missionaries (usually including a male and lady doctor), a German trader, and until recently a French trader. There is a constant immigration from Persia, chiefly of the labouring classes. Ihe climate is exceedingly hot in summer, the most trying period being the damp heat from mid-July to October, when the wet bulb thermometer often registers 100 c Fahrenheit. The months from November to April are temperate and pleasant, midwinter even cold. The rainfall is very scanty, and it has been surmised that the plentiful supply of spring water enjoyed by the islands must be derived from sources far in the interior of the Arab mainland. Statistics. Trade statistics are published annually in H. B. M. Consular Reports for the Persian Gulf, and show that trade is increasing. Total Imports {excluding specie). £ Average for three years, 1895-97 ... ... 341,000 per annum. „ „ 1900-02 ... ... 472,000 Total Exports {excluding specie). £ Average for three years, 1895-97 ... ... 379,000 per annum. „ „ 1900-02 ... ... 534,000 Imports. Cattle and Sheep are imported from Persia, as the islands do not rear a sufficient supply for food. Coffee is used much more than tea by the Arabs. Brazilian coffee is displacing Indian, because cheaper. The average annual import of coffee for some years past has been about 7,000 cwt., and trade is increasing. Textiles. —The largest business is in grey shirtings of Manchester and Bombay manufacture. American sheeting is also in demand in two qualities (Lamp and Hawk marks) at Rs. 110 to Rs. 120 per bale of 25 pieces of 38 or 39 yards. Indigo dyed shirtings are in some demand for the Muharrem. Cotton prints are all cheap light fabrics from Manchester; spotted blue and white, red and white, and check patterns were most noted in the bazaars. The average annual import of cotton tissues has been from 50,000£. to 60,000J. in value, and the trade is increasing. There is a limited but increasing demand for silk and woollen goods. Grain and Provisions. —Rice is the most important import, large quantities being taken by the fishing fleets. The average annual import is 285,000cwts. Wheat was formerly obtained from Persia, but scarcity in that country in recent years has created a demand for Indian wheat. Building Timber, carried mostly by sailing craft, now comes from British East Africa. Tombac (not tobacco) is imported from Persia. Exports. Pearls .—Pearl fishing is the chief industry of Bahrein, and it is said that over 3,000 boats and 30,000 men collect for the fishing season. The Bahrein fleet is much the largest. Koweit also furnishes a strong fleet, and the smaller ports in the Ciulf send their contingents. The fishing season is from May to September, and operations are carried on at many different places along the coast, the grounds being open to all comers under condition of conforming to traditional rules. The shells are collected by divers, opened by knife, and thrown overboard after removal of the pearls, which are disposed of in Bahrein to dealers, many of whom come up from India for the season. Ereight to Bombay by mail steamer is one half per cent, on value. The annual value of pearls exported is estimated at 350,0002. to 400,0002, Shells .—The trade in oyster shells, long neglected, is now attracting more attention ; but the bulk of the shells brought to the surface have to be thrown overboard after search for pearls, as the boats cannot carry to market more than the shells collected during the last three or four days before returning to port. Those disposed of in Bahrein are mostly oyster shells; mussel and mother-of-pearl shells are more found in Persian waters. I)ates ) chiefly from the mainland, are disposed of in India and Bed Sea ports. The average annual export is about 60,000 cwt. Horses .—A few horses, also from the mainland, are sent to India. Textiles .—The weaving of sail cloth is a small native industry, in which Bombay yarns are employed. Customs. 'The Customs are farmed out for an annual rental of about 10,0002. Customs duty is 5 per cent, ad valorem. Coinage. The Maria Theresa dollar is the currency of the Arab mainland, and transactions with Bedouins are usually based on it. The Indian rupee is, however, in general use in the islands, and the employment of it for both quotations and payments is steadily extending. The Indian subsidiary silver coins are widely used for divisional money. The Turkish lira (gold) is also frequently employed as a means of effecting payments. Large quantities of rupees and dollars are needed every year by the pearl dealers during the fishing season, and are imported from Bombay. They filter back to India through the coast ports of the Gulf in payment for imported commodities. In good pearl seasons handsome profits used to be made on these specie operations, but the regular weekly steamer service now tends to keep margins nearer the actual cost of transmitting coin. Weights and Measures. Weights are— 1 Bubaa=4T14 lbs. avoir. 1 Man =57'6 lbs. avoir. 1 Rafaa=576 lbs. avoir. The lineal measure in the bazaars is a yard of 18f inches. Course of Trade. Bice and other provisions, which form a very important part of the imports, are necessarily supplied from India, and as the piece goods trade isonly beginning to acquire fair proportions, nearly all business is done through Bombay and falls largely to British Indian traders with agents or correspondents there. The regular steamer service with Bombay at low fares for deck passages has been availed of by many petty traders to make selection of goods there personally. The prosperity of Manameh as a trading port is not due to demand from the limited area and small population of the islands of Bahrein, but chiefly to its position as the rallying point of the pearl fishing fleets of the Gulf, which lay in supplies and dispose of pearls there during the fishing season, and before dispersing for home at its close provide themselves with stores for the winter. The island markets of Arabia have as yet less influence on the trade of Bahrein, but it is in this direction that increase of commerce may be looked for. Manameh is the natural emporium for commerce with El Katr and El Hassa. The coast towns of these districts have facile communication with Bahrein by sailing craft, but it is said to be difficult for ocean steamers to approach El Katif or Ujair, the two larger seaports from which caravan routes run to the inland parts of El Hassa, and in times of peace to Eiadh and even more distant markets in the interior of Arabia. This incipient trade, mostly piece goods business, is at present constantly blocked by local wars and feuds, but is persistently renewed when circumstances permit, and some day may develop into an important commerce with these wide but little known regions. There is some Kangun and Tahiri, than Bushire. . trade with ports on the opposite Persian coast, such as which are more accessible to sailing craft from Bahrein KOWEIT. The channel and inner harbour of Koweit have been buoyed recently by the Biitish India Steam Navigation Company. The steamers of their Persian Gulf line from Bombay have maintained a regular service at this port since the summer of 1901, and now call fortnightly. The frequent overcarrying of cargo on account of rough weather in the outer bay, w r hich has been hitherto a source of much inconvenience, should in future be less experienced. A strong fleet is sent to the pearl fishing, but both pearls and shells are disposed of in Bahrein. Some hides and skins are exported to India, and lamb skins are bought for the Russian market. Rice is largely imported from India, also other grains spices, and coffee. The demand for textiles, chiefly cotton piece goods, is partly for account of Busreh, to which goods are forwarded overland from the Core Abdullah. All business is done through Bombay, as at Muscat and Bahrein. Trade to inland parts of Arabia is hampered by the disturbed state of the country. An interest attaches to this port as a possible terminus for the projected Bagdad Railway, but the town itself is not likely to be that terminus, as it is on the further side of the bay from Busreh, with a wide expanse of shallow water in front, while on the north side of the bay the deep water is said to come nearer shore, and to be of much greater extent. PIRATE COAST. The ports of the Pirate Coast, such as Sharkah, Debai, Abu Dhabi, at present trade chiefly with Lingah, the nearest port of call for ocean steamers. Sailin' craft from these ports can generally both make Lingah and return therefrom on the prevailing wind. Steamers occasionally call at Debai, lying in an open bay with indifferent anchorage. Pearls and shells are the chief source of wealth of these coast villages, and are disposed of in Bahrein or Lingah. Rice, wheat, ghee, spices, coffee, and other provisions from India, and in textiles, grey and white shirtings and cheap Manchester prints of light fabric, with some canvas and coir rope for the sailing craft, are the principal imports.8 The Maria Theresa dollar is used as currency, but the rupee is almost as well known. The area supplied from these ports is sparsely populated, and with the exception of some trade with the northern parts of Oman, there does not appear to be outlet for an extensive commerce. QUESTIONS AEEECTING THE PERSIAN GULF REGIONS GENERALLY. It is satisfactory to note that the use of the rupee is increasing in the coast regions of Oman, Bahrein, and the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, for exchange risk is eliminated where silver dollar prices are not needed. But as the Maria Theresa dollar is the common medium of exchange in the interior of Arabia, it cannot be expected that the rupee will altogether dis place it at the coast ports. It has been suggested that a double rupee, which would be of about the same size and weight as a dollar, might be issued, but I fail to perceive any advantage in such a coin. The single rupee is already nearer the exchange value of the dollar, and its fiduciary value is thoroughly recognized iu these regions. The Indian subsidiary coins are reported to be widely used in Bahrein and the Arab coast, but in Oman a quarter anna or pice, similar to the Indian coin of that denomination, has unfortunately been issued in excess, its current value being about 1 pie. It is to be hoped H.H. the Sultan may prohibit further issues of this coin, and ultimately introduce Indian subsidiary coins. This would tend, I think, to establish the rupee as the currency of Oman, a result which would benefit trade as it is so largely with India. The average rate of freight by direct British steamers between the Persian Gulf and Europe ompared with that between India and Europe might suggest that there is still room for competition. There seems to be a possible opening for a coasting trade in these regions. A line of light draught cargo steamers, connecting with ocean steamers at such points as Muscat, Bunder Abbas, and Bahrein or Bushire, might secure a great part of the trade now carried in sailing craft to the minor ports of Oman and the Persian Gulf, and during the pearl fishing season carry provisions to the fishing fleets in exchange for shells, which at present cannot be brought to market. A reliable landing, delivery, and forwarding agency is much needed at certain ports, markedly at Bushire. The bulk of the Foreign trade of Oman, Bahrein, and the Arab coast of the Gulf is transacted through India, and is in the hands of British Indian traders, who obtain most of the manufactured goods they require from British shipping houses in Bombay. The limited market in any one of these places offers, I think, too small a field to promise a remunerative opening for a British or European trader in competition with our British Indian subjects; although perhaps an energetic trader settling in Bahrein or Bunder Abbas, if furnished with satistactory references, might secure in addition to general mercantile business, such other affairs as landing, forwarding, banking, and shipping agencies, which all together might produce an adequate recompense for residence in a somewhat trying climate and monotonous surroundings. In any case the collective value of our trade with these regions appears to me to deserve more attention than it at present receive. Oman and the Gulf are within easy reach of Bombay by passenger steamer, and any Bombay firm making a study on the spot of the condition and needs of the traders and markets of these regions, and keeping in touch with them by occasional visits, might collect and develop many threads of business. The shell trade, for instance, might reward attention. There appears to be a fair market for this article in Europe, and larger quantities than are at present exported may be procurable in Baherin and Lingah. Economy might also perhaps result from ttfe^ rough cutting of discs for buttons, &amp;c., in Bahrein, where labour is cheap, instead of, as at present, exporting the whole shell, of which a great part must be valueless. The inconvenience and loss of time caused by detention in quarantine stations in the Gulf is particularly vexatious to business men who wish to^ • 9 / make short visits at several places, and must impede activity in pushing tiade. Cannot Persia and Turkey be persuaded to adopt the rational view accepted in Muscat and Bahrein that first class passengers are much less likely than others to carry disease, and that adequate protection is afforded by making them report to the authorities at stated periods, without actual detention ? Some years ago a French Consul at Muscat suggested the installation there of a bazaar or depot of French merchandise, as perhaps the best means of developing commerce. A depot of this sort of Eussian commodities has recently been formed at Busreh, and probably ere now at Eushire. Russian and French traders have only recently begun to give particular attention to trade with the Persian Gulf, where their commodities are therefore little known and may benefit from exhibition in this manner. British and British Indian merchants have long traded with these regions, and I do not think they have lacked energy and enterprise in introducing commodities for which a fairly constant demand might be created. Consequently a similar exhibition of commodities from the British Empire would have to embrace a much wider range in order to afford a probability of the introduction of suitable hitherto unknown goods. I have pointed out elsewhere that small traders, the class most likely to make use of such a bazaar, now make much use of the cheap and frequent steamer service between India and the Gulf. The bazaars and shops of Bombay, I venture to think, offer a much wider field to these traders who go there expressly to seek articles likely to be profitable in trade, than any local exhibition would probably afford.KO S 2291 rom BRITISH RESIDENCY, PERSIAN GULF.

It will be seen that cargo from Kuwait is shown under the heading “ Asiatic-Turkey ” sub-heading “ Persian Gulf, ” a classification which seems open to objection on political grounds : l venture to suggest that the inclusion or Kuwait as one of the “ Native Principalities of Arabia” would be more appropriate and in keeping with tne general policy of Government. 3. It will fuither be observed that under the heading “ Maskat or Oman ” are included without distinction the ports of Maskat, Gwadur, Debai, Shargah, Sur and Masna. It would seem preferable if the heading “ Maskat Territory Trucial Oman ” were substituted for that at present employed. 4. 1 would further suggest the omission of “ Henjam ” from the ports shown under the heading “ Persia. ” The specific inclusion of the Island in Persia would appear inconvenient having regard to the indefinite status of the Island, with which the Government of India are familiar. 5 If these views meet with general concurrence, I beg that the Government of India will move the Department of Commerce and Industry to make the necessary revision of the list in question, and to issue an authoritative ruling to the various Customs Administrations in India as to the classification of the various ports of the Persian Gulf. /U No. 3188, dated 30th November 1912.

Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. Under instructions from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to submit the Trade Report of the Bahrein Islands for the year 1905 together with Statements of Imports and Exports and Shipping Returns. Report on the Trade of the Bahrein Islands for the year 1905. The trade of Bahrein has increased during the past year beyond all expec tation, the imports having risen from Rs. 1,48,84,129 to Rs. 2,43.01.519 and the exports from Rs. 1,35,07,491 to Rs. 2,04,50,643. The total volume there fore shows an increase of 57i per cent on the preceding year’s, which itself had never been exceeded previously. This result is the more remarkable firstly because in the early part of the year a good deal of nervousness was exhibited by British Indian and Persian merchants consequent upon the strained rela tions manifested for a short time between the Government of India and the Chief of Bahrein, and secondly in consequence of the epidemic of disease—on this occasion, plague—which for the third year in succession attacked the towns of Manama and Muharraq, causing a further loss of some 400 lives and tempo rarily driving several thousands of towns-people away to other parts of the Gulf. 2. The epidemic which commenced in May 1905, was fortunately not of long duration as it failed to maintain itself in the hot weather, and the islands were declared free of disease in June 1905. 3. Apart from the evidence of statistics the general prosperity of the mercantile community is apparent from the numbers of new and substantial buildings which are in course of construction, the high prices at which lands and houses have changed hands in the towns, and the increasing influx of merchants from Linga, Basra, Hasa and Bushire, 4. The chief reason for this improvement is undoubtedly the strong attitude adopted by the British Government in February 1905 for the purpose of punishing the unruly subjects whom the Chief himself had been unable to control. An increase of confidence and security therefore pervaded all classes, including even the agriculturists whose lot is probably the worst in Bahrein, and it is confidently anticipated that the future will show no relapse from this state. 5. Prophecies are even being freely hazarded that the trade of Bahrein will soon equal that of Maskat, which port at present does the largest business in this corner of the world, 6 . The firms of Gray Paul &amp; Co., and Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co., have been at work throughout the year, and the hot season brought two French specula tors in pearls to Manama. 7. The earlier arrival, M. Perronne, is not believed to have done well as he apparently was an amateur in the trade, hut Madame Nattan, the proprietress of a large retail jewellery business in Paris, who came later, bought some 4,00,000 francs’ worth of pearls, and her return this year is said to have been fully decided upon. 8. The British India Steam Navigation Company have this year had a monopoly of the carriage of cargo in steamers, the Bombay and Persian Steam Navigation Company being the only other shipping line whose vessels have visited the port. The latter have carried pilgrims only to Jedda and back. This state of affairs has given much dissatisfaction to Bahrein merchants, and consequently the report that the Hamburg-American line is making arrange- inents to run steamers to all the Gulf ports has been cordially welcomed even by the Hindu traders. 379FD9. The following remarks attempt to account for the more noticeable variations in the trade of particular items, comparing the present year’s opera tions w ith those of 1904 :— (а) Horses.—This trade is a purely transit one. The decrease both in imports and exports was due to the unsettled condition of Central and Eastern Arabia, and the consequent home demand for purposes of warfare. (б) Coir and coir rope. —The decrease in imports was due to the large stock on hand at the close of the preceding year. The selling price at the same time w^as considerably raised, in consequence of the increase in rates at Malabar. (c) Piece-goods. —The decreased import was due to the high prices ruling in Europe at the early part of the year. (d) Pates. —The increase both in imports and exports was due to the fact that in Hasa and Katif the date crop was exceptionally good, w r hile in Bahrein it was below the average. There was in addition a strong demand from the Red Sea Ports. Eor want of steamers a coosiderable quantity was on hand at the end of the year. (e) Wheat. —The imports were much benefit ted by the low prices pre* vailing in Persia and the continued suppression of the embargo. (/) itar/ey.—The decrease in imports was due to the requirements of Hasa being this year carried direct from Basra to Ojair, instead of through Bahrein. (y) Pice. —The increase in imports was due to the foresight of merchants who, receiving bad reports from India of the prospects of the new crops imported some 45,000 cwts. of the old crop at the end of the year, for account of 1906. The transaction is said to be unprecedented. (h) Kerosine oil. —The decrease in imports was due partly to the large stock on hand from 1904 and partly to the high prices ruling in consequence of the disturbed state of the Russian oil districts. (i) Pearls. —The increase both in imports and exports was due partly to the fishing season having been the best of the last 3 years both in quantity and quality of pearls and in regard to the demand in Europe, and partly because the leading pearl-merchants of Katar and Turkish ports have this year entered more keenly into compe tition with merchants in Bahrein itself and in consequence have shipped their purchases from the local divers direct from this port to India. (;) Shells. —The decrease in exports was due to the slightness of demand in Europe. There was a considerable stock from past years on hand at the close of the year. At the same time, the pearl- boat-men themselves displayed little inclination to collect shells for sale, in consequence of the very good pearling. (k) Timber and wood .—The decreased import was probably due to the tension between the Governments of India and Bahrein having occurred at the season for this business. Great inconvenience in consequence resulted to the general public. (/) Specie. —The increased import was for the purchase of pearls. The enormous export consisted mainly of Turkish liras to Hasa and of liras, dollars and rupees to Katif for the purchase of dates. 10 Sixty-five British steam-ships visited Bahrein on the voyage up the Gulf, and thirty-five called on the return journey. Clearance certificates arc3 only applied for and granted in a few instances, as the Political Agent is not officially required to perform all the duties of a Harbour Master or Consul. Two special steamers of the Bombay Persian Steam Navigation Company brought pilgrims back from Jedda in March and April 1905 and three steamers of the same Company took away some 1,200 in November and December. 11. No foreign steamers entered the port during 1905. Exchange .—The Maria Theresa dollar opened the year at Bs. 137 per cent., its highest point, and closed at the same rate on the 31st December 1905. The value varied but little during the year, the lowest rate being Rs. 130 per cent. s 12 - Freights .—Ereights to and from India were from Rs. 10 to Rs. 12 per ton throughout the year. The rate for shells to the United Kingdom was £ 2 per ton. Bahrein; \ F. B.

A general description of the physical, poli tical and commercial peculiarities of the Islands is given in part I of the Report for the year 1912-13 (annual series No. 5052). Since that year the regular population has increased to about 110,000 and a larger number of foreigners now visit the Islands in the pearling season. As reported last year the local Customs Department does not keep accurate statistics, consequently these have to be prepared from steamers' manifests, access to which has been readily given by the courtesy of the Customs Director. They are, therefore, incomplete, especi ally as regards exports to the mainland which are all carried in native boats without manifests. A large quantity of merchandise is also imported by native craft of which none except those coming from India and owned by Indians carry manifests. The statistics regarding movements of pearls and specie are very incomplete, as numbers of local pearl merchants who travel to and from Bombay and the foreign pearl merchants cany large quantities of pearls and specie in their luggage or on their persons. There is no bank in Bahrain and many lakhs of rupees are brought in every year by registered post in the form of Indian currency notes of R 1,000 or 500. It is, of course, impossible to obtain statistics of all these sums. Openings for British Trade. The trade of the Bahrain Islands is to a great extent in the hands of Hindu, Indian Mohammedan and Persian merchants, who have been settled in these Islands for a century and thus by far the greater portion of the trade is with India. There is one British and one German firm established in Bahrain, and there do not 431 F. &amp; P. D. appear to be any special openings for other British firms. The absence of direct communication with England and consequent high freights still handi cap British trade. Customs. The improved arrangements for landing and delivering cargo are now working satisfactorily. The tariff is fixed at 5 per cent, ad valorem by treaty and at the present time the Customs work is being carried on for the Ruler of Bahrain by an Indian (Hindu) firm, a member of w r hich acts as the Director of Customs. Inquiries regarding Trade. The Political Agent will be very glad to answer any inquiries regarding trade from mer chants in the United Kingdom through the Com mercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by addressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary subjects is avail able in his records. Shipping and Communications.

The pearl trade still dominates the whole commercial situation, and the movements of pearls and specie, though reacting on the movements of general merchandise, must be taken by them selves.

The total value of imports into the Bahrain Islands amounted to £1,877,630 as against £2,239,527 of the previous year, showing a decrease of £361,897 or 15*7 per cent. 1912-13 was a record year but the figures were swollen by the large sales of pearls. In the year under report the catch was smaller. The imports of General merchandise have increased by 53*3 percent. The reason for the increase in imports is chiefly due to arrival of two large consignments of rice in April and May 1913, and of one in March 1914. Exports. The total value of exports for the year under report amounted to £1,740,008 as against £2.295,136, showing a decrease of £555,128 or 24-2 per cent. The greater part of this decrease is due to the smaller catch of pearls and to the fact that the whole catch was not sold owing to the brokers holding up for higher prices. &amp; A large amount of specie was consequentlv re-exported Exports are sent by native craft to both coasts of the Gulf and no accurate statistics being obtain- a de it is impossible to say if the decrease is real or apparent. The examination of the figures for general merchandise show that the percentages of the total imports coming from various countries in 1913-14 as compared with 1912-18 are as follows : — Imports. Country. 1S12-13. 1913-14. Increase or Decrease. per cent. per cent. per cent. India . . Neighbouring countries 61-2 25-5 721 21-9 + 10-9 -3-6 bordering on the Persian Gulf.

For exports the percentages are as follows : — Country. 1912-13. 1913-14. Increase or Decrease. per cent. per cent. per cent.

This port is a distributing centre for goods for Ratr, Katif and Hassa and a smuggling depot for certain goods on which a high tariff is levied in Persia. Proportion of British and Indian Trade. Excluding specie and pearls the principal articles of imports into Bahrain (other than slaugh ter animals and fuel, etc,, which are only of interest to merchants in the neighbouring countries) are as follows : — Articles, Value impor- PEBCBNTAGEa IMPOBTBD VBOIC ted in 1913-14.

The United Kingdom does not produce any of the commodities in demand in Bahrain except piece- goods and sugar ; as regards the former a great deal of that shown under “ India ” no doubt comes originally from the United Kingdom but British sugar is not yet able to compete with continental beet sugar, owing to its slightly higher price.

Introduction .—A general description of the physical, political and commer cial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the report for the year 1911-12 Annual series (No. 5052). Since last year’s report the population has slightly decreased to about 103,000. The decrease is mostly amongst the foreigners, and is due partly to plague which appeared here at the end of the official year and partly to the opening up of Mesopotamia where better prospects of business exist. The local Customs Department does not keep accurate statistics, conse quently these have to be prepared from steamers’ and boats’ manifests access to which has been readily given by the courtesy of the Customs Director. They are, therefore, incomplete, especially as regards exports to the mainland, which are all carried in native boats without manifests and over which the Customs Director has no control owing to the merchandise having been shipped from private godowns direct into the boats without passing through the Customs House. A large quantity of merchandhe is also imported by native craft, of wffiich none except those coming from India carry manifests and, when the owners of the native craft are Persians or Arabs, these manifests are not always produced and, if produced, the cargo seldom agrees with the manifest. The statistics regarding movements of pearls and specie are very incom plete, as numbers of local pearl merchants, who travel to and from *Bombav, and the foreign pearl merchants, carry large quantities of pearls and specie in their luggage or on their person. There is no bank in Bahrain, and many lakhs of rupees are brought in every year by registered post in the form of Indian currency notes of E*. 1,000 and Ks. 500. It is, of course, impossible to obtain statistics of all these sums. • j2 Effects of War. —In comparison with 1915-16, which was also a war-year, trade in general and the pearl trade in particular shows a decided improvement. The dislocation of steamship service, owing to so many ships of the British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, and of other Companies having been taken off the run, and the severe restrictions imposed in India on the export of merchandise, greatly enhanced the prices of all articles during the year under report. Owing to restrictions on the export of specie from India, the pearl merchants experienced difficulties in obtaining funds for the purchase of pearls, and began, in lieu of specie, to import piece goods, rice and coffee, by the sale of which they put themselves in funds. Hence the increase in the import of piece goods by £195,680, rice by £16,701 and coffee by £17,100 as compared with the year 1915-16. A large quantity of currency notes also were imported by passengers on their persons and exchanged in Bahrain for silver at a loss of 5 per cent. The pearl market improved greatly during the year under report and the prices obtained were about 30 per cent., higher than those ruling in 1915-16, exports of pearls showing a value of £361,400, as compared with £184,156 in the previous year; and there was still a large demand for pearls in the United States and India itself in spite of the war. Pearls were also finding their way to the Japanese market. Opening for British Trade. —The trade of the Bahrain Islands is to a large extent in the hands of Hindu and Indian Muhammadan merchants who have had business connections with the Islands for over a century, and far the greater portion of the trade is with India. Messrs. Gray, Paul and Company, the Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, is the only British firm. The absence of direct communication with the United Kingdom still handicaps British trade.’ Ctistoms. —The tariff is fixed by treaty at 5 per cent., ad valorem on all imports, including transhipment cargo, and at the present time the Customs’ work is being carried on for the Buler of Bahrain by an Indian (Hindu) firm, a member of which acts as the Director. Enquiries regarding Trade. —The Political Agent will be very glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from British firms in any part of the Empire. Such enquiries should be sent through the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade, London, or the Director General of Commercial Intelligence, Calcutta, as may be more convenient. Time would probably be saved by addressing the latter official, as information on most ordinary subjects is available in his records. Shipping and communication. —Shipping has been completely disorganised by the war and the regular mail service has been abandoned. Only 40 vessels entered the port, as compared with 49 in 1915-16 and a normal number of 86, Calls have been made as follows :— Name of line. Calls on. Up voyage. Down voyage.

The increases were in piece-goods, rice and coffee imported in lieu of specie as already noted, and specie due to improvement in the pearl market over the previous year. Exports. —The total value of exports for the year under report amounted to £779,943 as against £368,903 in 1915-16 showing an increase of £411,040 or lll^ per cent. As exports do not pass through the Customs House and are almost entirely, excepting specie and pearls, by native crafts, no accurate statistics are available. The figure for piece-goods (Le., £117,051) is probably slightly below the mark as two-thirds of the imports of piece-goods have probably been re-exported to Persia and the mainland of Arabia; the low figure for rice (&amp;.&lt;?., £104,215) may be accounted for in the same manner. The increase in the total value of exports is mainly due to raising of the Persian blockade and better security on the trade route to Najd and partly to high prices ruling.

Fifty per cent, of the white shirtings which are known as American shirtings or one-fifth of the entire import of piece goods have come from Japan via Bombay; similarly 50 per cent, of the hosiery are of Japan origin, 60 per cent, of glass, lamp and toy ware belong to Jap^n. Japan and China also contribute soft sugar to the extent of 30 per cent, via Bombay. Destination of Exports. Country. 1915-16. 1916-17. Increase or Decrease.

Bahrain is a distributing centre for both sides of the Gulf, i.e., Qatar, Qatif, Nejd and Persia. Smuggling of certain goods on which high tariff is levied in Persia has greatly lessened, though it has not entirely ceased, owing to a deposit of the equivalent of the Persian Customs duty being taken by the Bahrain Customs Department before goods can be exported to a Persian port. On receipts from the Persian Customs authorities being produced, the Bahrain Customs Department refunds the deposit. Proportion of British and Indian trade .—Excluding specie and pearls, the principal articles of import into Bahrain (other than slaughter animals and fuel, etc., which are only of interest to merchants in the neighbouring countries) are as follows :— Articles.

Thus 60 per cent, of the piece-goods probably originally come from Great Britain and a considerable percentage from Japan; the greater part of the sugar is from Java, Borneo and the Far East. P. G.

INTRODUCTION. A general description of the physical, political and commercial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the report for the year 1911-12 Annual series (No. 5052). Since last year’s report the permanent population has remained more-or-less stationary and still numbers about 103,000. During the pearling season there is usually a large temporary increase in the population. The local Customs department keeps no statis tics of imports and exports, consequently these have to be prepared from steamers’ and boats’ manifests, access to which has been readily given by the courtesy of the Customs Director. They are, therefore, incomplete, especially as regards exports to the mainland and Persian coast, which have all been carried in native boats and until quite recently without manifests, and over which the Customs Director had no control owing to the merchandise having been shipped from private godowns direct into the boats without passing through the Customs House. Quite recently, however, at the suggestion of the Political Agent, the Shaikh has issued stringent instructions that all goods must pass through the Customs House and steps are being taken to enforce production of manifests for all merchandise imported into and exported from Bahrain by native craft. A certain quantity will still, however, undoubtedly be smuggled out of the Port. The statistics regarding movement of pearls and specie are very incomplete, as numbers of local pearl merchants, who travel to and from Bombay, also foreign pearl merchants, carry large quantities of pearls and specie in their luggage or on their 471 F. * F. person. Owing to absence of steamship service, particularly during the pearl season, a large quantity of pearls were exported by native boats to Bushire for shipment to India. There is no Bank in Bahrain, and many lakhs of rupees are brought in every year by registered post in the form of Indian currency notes of R 1,000 and R50e. It is, of course, impossible to obtain statistics of all these sums. EFFECTS OF WAR. The year under review shows a general improve ment in the trade over the year 1916-17. The retail prices of all staple food-stuffs were abnor mally high throughout the year owing to high cost price and increased freight by steamship service as well as native craft. The Political Agent in consultation with the Chief of Bahrain was obliged to regulate prices of necessaries of life to avoid hoarding and profiteering. Owing to severe restrictions on the export of specie from India, the pearl merchants experienced great difficulty in obtaining funds for the purchase of pearls, and began to issue telegraphic orders (hundis) at a loss of from R40 to R90 per R 1,000 through the local general merchants who, in anticipation of this difficulty, had imported, in lien of specie, piece-goods, rice, wheat, coffee, and sugar in excess of the normal requirements for the year, and who were, in consequence, in urgent need of drafts for payment to their head offices in India. They took this opportunity to make large profits on exchange, and began to sell merchandise at a narrow margin so as to be able to keep the pearl merchants in sufficient funds for purchase of- ) \ « ! 2 pearls, and at the same time obtain telegraphic orders from them for payment to their head offices in Bombay or Karachi. Towards the end of November 1917 there was a glut in the piece-goods, coffee, wheat and rice partly in consequence of the overstocked market and partly due to absence of the usual visits of the overland merchants and caravans at this time of the year. In January 1918, however, Kuwait merchants called here and large stocks of food stuffs were shipped to Kuwait. The restrictions in Kuwait soon put a stop to this outlet, and the merchants found themselves with a large stock of goods, particularly piece-goods and rice at the end of the official year. OPENING FOR BRITISH TRADE. The trade of the Bahrain Islands is to a large extent in the bands of Hindu and Indian Muhammadan merchants, who have had business connections with the Islands for over a century, and far the greater portion of the trade is with India. Messrs. Gray, Paul and Company, the Agent of the' British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, is the only British firm. CUSTOMS. The tariff is fixed by treaty at 5 per cent ‘Ad valorem^ on all imports, including transhipment cargo, and at the present time the Customs , work is being carried on for the Ruler of Bahrain by an Indian (Hindu) firm, a member of which acts ns Director. Export duty of RIO per bundle of hides and R *2 per bundle of dates is charged. ENQUIRIES REGARDING TRADE. The Political Agent will be very glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade,from British firms in any part of the Empire. Such enquiries should be sent through the Commercial Intelli gence Branch of the Board of Trade, London, or j the Director General of Commercial Intelligence, (Calcutta, as may be more convenient. Time would probably be saved by addressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary subjects is available in his records. SHIPPING AND COMMUNICATION. Shipping has continued to be upset by the war, owine: to so many British India and other Companies ships having been taken off the run, consequently the regular mail service had to be abandoned. A Hired Transport with mails has called here once a month from May 1917. Only 27 merchant vessels entered the port, as compared with 4() in 1916-17 and a normal number of 86 . Calls have been made as follows :— Name of line. Calls on Up voyage. Down voyage. The I’ritish India Steam Navigation Company, Limited. 19 7 The Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company, Limited. 6 1 The Abad Line, Limited 3 1 Freights varied from £3 to £5-10 per ton to India (Bombay or Karachi) as compared with £2-10 per ton in 1916-17.

The total value of imports into Bahrain : amounted to £1,607,019 as compared with I £1,529,758 in 1916-17 showing an increase of j of £77,291 or 5 05 per cent. The increase is # t # 13 mostly in value due to high prices of all com- ; modities during the year under report and partlv to slight increase in the quantity of wheat 1 , 4-33 tons, Sugar (soft) 762 tons and tea 2,139 cwts over 1916-17. Piece-goods, coffee and rice though normal as compared with 1916-17 show large increase against pre-war years. All these articles were imported, in lieu of specie, which is strictly prohibited, in order to meet the demand of pearl merchants. EXPORTS. The total value of exports for the year under report amounted to £817,243 as against £779,943 in 1916- !7 showing an increase of £37,300 or 4*78 per cent. Export of specie has dropped by £120,594 or per cent, due to restrictions against the export of specie from India; conse- quenty specie in Bahrain, which would ordinarily have been shipped to India, was utilised in purchase of pearls or hoarded here. The decrease in pearls of 12‘73 per cent, is probably exaggerated as a large quantity of pearls were shipped by native craft to Bushire, figures of which could not be obtained. The export of pearls would approxi mately amount to £4,00,000. There is also a tendency on|the part of the pearl merchants to undervalue pearls shipped by steamers in order to save in freight, apart from the fact that a large amount of pearls are carried personally bv merchants returning to India. The slight increase of 7 , 50 per cent, in general merchandise is mainly due to rise in value. Origin of Imports. Country. 1916-17. 1917-18. Increase or Decrease.

The variation of 28*19 in the flow of trade between India and the neighbouring countries is due to heavy fall in’ specie and slightly in pearls, tbe two main items of export from these Islands to India, which, if omitted, would mean that practi cally all the export of merchandise from this port would be for the neighbouring countries. The export to the mainland has greatly improved particularly in rice, wheat, coffee, spices, sugar, tea, piece-goods and coir rope partly on account of improvement in the import of pearls and partly to better facilities for the prevention of smuggling into Persia. The issue of manifests for all cargo exported to Persia, and taking of deposits the equivalent of the Persian Customs duties have deterred Persian boats from exporting merchandise direct from this port to Persian coast ports where no Customs officials are established. PROPORTION OF BRITISH AND INDIAN TRADE. Excluding specie and pearls, the principal articles of Import into Bahrain (other than fuel, cattle and other live-stock, etc., which are only of interest to merchants in the neighbouring coun tries) are as follows.

A general description of the physical, poli tical, and commercial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the repoi-t for the year 1911-1A ( A nnual series No. 5052). The permanent po pulation has increased to about 115,000, this increase being mainly among the foreign com mercial community doing business in Manama. The local Customs Department is run on very unbusinesslike lines and though there has been a marked improvement in their work during the last year, it still does not maintain anything like accurate statistics, consequently trade figures have to be prepared from the manifests of steamers, and country craft, access to which has been readily given by the courtesy of the local Customs Director. The statistics given in this report are an improvement on those of last year (1919) as far as accuracy goes, as the order introduced by the Ruler of Bahrain, at the instance of this Agency, last year that all goods whether imported or exported should pass through the Customs house has had time to get understood. This order is being carried out by all concerned and is creditably su pervised by the Customs Officials. In spite of the above however the position in regard to the movement of pearls and specie is very unsatisfactory. Hence accurate statistics under these heads are next to impossible. Large numbers of local and foreign pearl merchants continue the practice of travelling to and from Bombay and Karachi, carrying large quantities of pearls and notes in their luggage or on their person. Ther&amp; would indeed appear to he no re medy so long as the steqjship Companies charge the public for carrying pearls and specie. In my report for 1918-19 I mentioned that the Shaikh of Hahrain had after much difficulty and opposition consented to the establishment of a Bank in Bahrain. From information I am glad to report that this has materialized quite recently, though subsequent to the period under report, and to-day a branch of the Eastern Bank, Ltd., has its o'Fce in the busiest quarter of Manama. It was opened on 10th June 1920. To commence . with, the Bank was greatly handicapped in its work by the prohibition on the export of silver from India. This prohibition Avas removed by order of the Government of India (September 1920) and the position of the Bank at once be came assured. Atpre-ient most of the business is done by the sale of drafts on India. But an in 1 creasing number of persons are using the Bank as a place to deposit their surplus cash. For the present the Bank gives no interest on deposits’ under arrangement with the Ruler of Bahrain, interest being looked upon as contrary to Mussal- man law. Effects of the War. 2. During the last two years the severe restric tions imposed by the Government of India on the export of silver from India hit the Bahrain pearl ing fraternity very hard. The latter were com pelled to draw telegraphic orders (hundies) in consequence on local merchants for funds, at a loss from Rs. 60 to Rs. 180 per Rs. 1,000 during the season. It is expected that things will be considerably eased during the 1920 season, mainly owing to the removal of the embargo on silver and to the foresight of the Bank, which has provided itself with a considerable silver re serve with a view to supplying the Divers with their silver wants. Governments rice policy still continues in force—* that is to say Bahrain as well as other Gulf ports are given a definite rice ration for the year. During 1920 the ration was greatly increased, to the satisfaction of all concerned, but the intro duction of the Tender system at Karachi has largely nullified the concession. At the present moment the Tender system is chiefly responsible to keeping prices up in Bahrain. As working2 now it means that only rice from Karachi is allowed to be exported to the Gulf, and no one is permitted to export until he has purchased the right to do so. This right is obtained by mer chants bidding agaii st each other for the right to export a bag of rice. At one period the Tender /4&gt; rose to, I believe, 11 per bag of rice. Natur ally the consumer has had to pay. The system has caused the greatest dissatisfaction in Bahrain. It is ^mostly hoped 1921 will see its final abolition. Openings for British Trade. 3. The trade of Bahrain Islands and as a re sultant the trade of Hassa and Nejd, is to a great extent in the hands of Hindus, Indian Moham medan, and Persian merchants, who have had bu siness connections with Islands for over a century • and a half, and by far the greater portion of this trade is with India. The only British firm is the ^Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Limited (late Grey Paul and Company ). In recent corre spondence with the Director of Commercial Intel ligence, Calcutta, I advocated the appointment of a Government Commercial Agent in Bahrain, whose primary duty would bo to put merchants in direct touch with English Houses and generally advise in matters of trade, etc. With the increas ing importance of Bahrain as the distributing centre of central Arabian trade I think the experi ment well worth a trial. I might here remark that owing to the friction which has existed between the Ruler of central Arabia with his neighbours in the Hejaz nearly all trade that used to come into Arabia vid the west (Medina, etc.) now comes into his country vid Bahrain and Koweit. Again as recently as 3 months ago Bin Saud ordered all his merchants of the provmce of Qassim (central A rabia) to use Bahrain, as their port instead of Koweit. It is unnecessary to go into details as to reasons, etc. The fact remains that the trade of Bahrain is on the increase. Customs. 4. The Tariff is fixed by treaty at 5 per cent. ad t’a^org ^subsequent to p eriod under report) on all imports.( By an order of the Government of India ^ in June 192QXthe tax on goods landed at Bahrain in transit for the mainland was reduced to 2 per cent, from 5 per cent at which it formerly stood. Export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle of hides and Rs. 2 per basket of dates is charged. The Customs work is carried on for the Ruler of Bahrain by a Hindu firm, a member of which acts as Director. Owingto the lack of a shed on the landing pier goods get very damaged especi ally during the rains. It is hoped during 1921 this defect would be remedied. Enquiries regarding trade. 5. The Political Agent, Bahrain, who is in close i touch with local and mainland affairs, will be very glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from merchants in the United Kingdom, through the Commercial Intelligence branch of the Board of Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by addressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary subjects is avail able in his records. Shipping. 6 . Shipping has continued to be very unsatis factory and the trade of the port has suffered in pi’oportion. The regular Mail Service has been abandoned though strong efforts are being made to reintroduce a regular upward Mail Service again. (Note.—Subsequent results have been satisfac tory and now 1920, a regular w r eeklv up and fortnightly down service has been reintroduced). Only 56 vessels entered the port on the up voyage as compared with the normal No. 86 , and 10 vassels called on the down voyage. Freights varied from £3 to £5 per ton from or to Bombay and Karachi by steamer, and by country craft £1-10-0 to £2-5-0 per ton. General remarks on trade. 7 (a) As usual the pearl trade continues to dominate the whole commercial situation, and the movements of pearls and specie, though reacting on the general movements of merchandise and foodstuffs must be taken by themselves. The table below showing the total import and export under these heads for the year 1919-20 and the previous year are of interest. Imports. Year. Specie. Pearls. Total of Specie and pearls.

This compares favourably with £1,350,060 of 1913-19 and shows an increase of £64,363 which is satisfactory considering the poor state of shipping. Exports. (c) The total value of exports for the year under report amounted to £946,344 as against £1,317,811 in 1918-19 and £817,243 for the year lt&gt;17-18. In other words exports have dropped £371,467 since last year. The fall is due to the fact that a large quantity of pearls is believed to have been carried by passengers, with themselves without being declared at the Customs. Origin of Imports.

Benn, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat- INTRODUCTION. Muscat is the capital and the principal port of the Sultanate of Oman, which comprises a por tion of the south-eastern coast of Arabia up to the entrance to the Persian Gulf. Muscat is the only port of call for steamers in Oman, but as the town lies at the end of a cove surrounded by huge rocky hills, it has no means of communication with the interior. The neighbouring town of Matrah, about 2 miles up the coast, supplies this want, and is the local centre for trade with the interior. CURRENCY. The currency of the country is the Maria Theresa dollar and the debased copper coin minted in 1895 to the order of His Highness the Sultan. Sovereigns and British Indian coins are also current in Muscat and Matrah. In the interior these coins are exchanged at a discount. Trade accounts are kept in Mohamadis and Gaj, imaginary coins. There are two kinds of Mohamadis black and white. Black 20^ = 1 dollar and white 11^ = 1 dollar. The white is used in wholesale trade accounts and the black for fruits, vegetables, etc. Most Hundis from India show their face value in Mohamadis and not in rupees: — 20 gaj = l mohamadi 11^ mohamadis =1 dollar 100 mohamadis = 1 toman. The rate of exchange between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee varied from 246 #. &amp; e. u. Rs. 145-8-0 (£9-14-0) to Rs. 154-8-0 (£10-6-0) per 100 dollars, the lowest being in March and the highest in October. . ^he following gives the average rates ruling in the local market in each month for the past three years :— Month 1911-12. 1912-13. 1913-14. Rs. Rs. Rs. April .... 132* 141* 148* May .... 137* 141* 149* June .... 141* 143 1501 July .

There are two different kinds of these—one for the Sultan’s Customs, and the other for retail bazaar use :— (i) Those used by the Sultan’s Customs are 1 kias . . $6 or 5*9375 ozs. 1 Mascat mannd . $144 or 24 kias or 8 lbs. 14i ozs. 10 Mascat maunds . 1 farsala. 200 Mascat rnaunds . 1 bahr. There is yet another weight also called &lt;f Bahr ” which is equal to 400 Mascat maunds.2 This weight is exclusively used for weighing salt. (ii) Bazaar weights are :— 1 kias $5-71 or 5-671 ozs. 24 kias or $137 or 81bs. 8 ozs. . 1 raaund of MaScat. With the exception of rice, which is sold in bags, all cereals are sold by palli and farrah (wooden bowls) :— 40 pallis .... 1 farrak. 20 farrabs .... 1 khandi. When measuring in palli the measure is heaped up. The Indian rupee is taken as one tola and is used for weighing perfumeries. The weight of a Maria Theresa dollar is called “ whoogiah }} and is chiefly used in weighing “ amber — 6 miskals ... 1 rupee weight. 8 miskals ... $1 weight. MEASURES. 1 shibr= 1 palm or 4! 7 2 thraabs = 1 yard. 2 shibrs = J thraah or 9'' 4 thraahs = l baah. lthraah = l / 6'' 1 baah = 1 fathom. Note. —In all transactions the measure thraah is used. POPULATION. The population of Muscat is estimated at about 10,000 persons and that of Matrah at about 14,000. No regular census has ever been taken. Neither of these towns makes any pre- j tence of sanitation. Muscat presents a pictures que appearance from the sea, but the interior of the town is, for the most part, mean and squalid. Matrah is, if anything, worse than Muscat. The interior of Oman is mountainous and the inhabitants, for the most part, are poor. The population is estimated at about 500,000, of whom a considerable portion are nomadic. PUBLIC HEALTH. Although Muscat is frequently described as one of the hottest towns in the world, it cannot be said to be unhealthy. During the year 1913- 14 the highest temperature recorded was 110° Fahr. and the lowest 69°. The high temperatures are due to the hot winds, wl ich at certain times in the summer months, and generally only for a few hours at night, blow from the Arabian deserts and barren rocks round Muscat. For the greater part of the summar, owing to the high state of humidity of the atmosphere in com bination with a high temperature, the climate is very trying. From November till the middle or end of March, the weather is distinctly pleasant but fails to be bracing as the temperature seldom falls below 60° Fahr. The rainfall averages 4 inches only and it is due to this fact that Mascat may be considered a fairly healthy tropical port, provided ordinary precautions are taken to purify the drinking water by boiling or filtration, and to protect one-self from mosquitoes which, during the winter months, are numerous in the town and the cause of a considerable amount of malaria amongst natives. Small-pox occurred in Matrah, Sidab and to a less extent in Muscat during the latter half of the year. There were no cases of cholera or plague during the year. Six cases of black-water fever occured during the year two of which were fatal. Agriculture The majority of the settled inhabitants live by agriculture, of which date cultivation is the principal * form, but the moun tainous and arid nature of the country does not lend itself to remunerative agriculture and the quarrelsome nature of the tribesmen does not encourage modern methods. Government The Government of Oman is absolute and somewhat primitive. There are no law courts in the European sense, cases are usually decided by the Sultan and his Walia (Governors) in accordance with Muhammadan law or local usage. Commercial law does not exist and claims against Arab subjects are difficult to settle. Language :—The language of the country is Arabic : many persons in Muscat and Matrah speak Persian, Baluchi and Hindustani. Business communications can, however, be sent in English. The post and telegraph offices at Muscat (the only ones in Oman) have been established by the Indian Government. CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION. The Customs are managed by His Highness the Sultan through a paid Superintendent, a British Indian subject who was, however, re placed on the 4th December 1913 by an Arab, Salim bin Abdulla al Khaimri. An import duty not exceeding 5 per cent, ad valorem is levied by His Highness and this can be paid in kind when there is any dispute about the value. No export duty of any kind is leviable or paid by , merchants except an internal transit duty of3 5 per cent, on dates, which is recovered from the owners of the produce. The landing arrange ments have remained the same as in the last year in the hands of a company of 4 Arab merchants. Complaints of pilfering, however, are still occa sionally heard. Roads and communications :—The remarks made in the report for 1909-10 still hold good. No wheeled traffic exists in the country, locomo tion being by means of camels and donkeys by land and country craft by sea. The interior is usually in an unsettled condition and travelling without a large escort is dangerous. Owing to an internal rebellion against His Highness the Sultan during the past year travelling in the interior was impracticable. TOTAL TRADE. The total value of trade for the year under review, according to the statistics supplied, amounted to Rs. 1,01^9,564 as against Rs. 1,14,75,426 of the previous year. Showing a nett decrease of Rs. 12,&amp;5,862 or over 121 per cent, as against the increase of Rs.10,99,820 of the previous year. These figures include the figures of trade carried by sailing craft amounting to Rs. 6,07,493 as against Rs. 4,62,908 showing an increase in trade by sailing craft of Rs. 1,44,585 or 24 per cent. SHARE OF TRADE. The following table shows the percentage of the total trade taken by each country. It will be seen that as usual India has taken the largest share and has handled over § rds of the total trade. Then comes in order the Arab Coast, United States of America and the United Kingdom : — Countries. Aden . Arab Coast Belgium Jibo iti France . Germany India Persia Port Said Sweden. Turkey in Asia United Kingdom United States of A Zanzibar Otber countries Total IMPORTS. The total value of imports, for the year, amounted to Rs.61,16,520 as against Rs. 69,53,263 of the previous 3 r ear showing a nett falling off of Rs. 8,36,743 or 13 per cent, as compared with an increase last year of Rs. 9,33,463. A glance at the import returns will show that the import trade has not suffered so seriously as might have been expected considering the dis turbed condition of interior which prevailed throughout the year. The actual import trade—if we eliminate the items under “ Arms and Ammuni tion ”—shows an increase over last year's figures. Last year's imports included an item of over 27 lacs under “Arms and Ammunition/' This year's imports, under the same head, amount to only 2 lacs. Deducting these totals from the total imports of their repective years, we find that whereas in 1912-13 the balance works out to 41 lacs odd, for the year under report, the balance comes to 59 lacs, thus showing an improvement of over 17 lacs over last year’s imports. This result may be considered satisfactory. Against the decrease of Rs. 25,57,963 under “Arms and Ammunition'’ there is a correspond ing increase of over 25 lacs, 20 lacs of which are accounted for by the following items, the balance of 5 lacs being distributed over other minor heals :— Import.

The value of the year's imports is more than that of the imports of last year showing the enormous increase of Rs. 11,05,403 or 55 per cent. The reason for this large increase is that rice was cheaper in India and Muscat merchants seized the opportunity to buy largethe country, however, they were unable to dispose ot their stocks and at the end of the year there was a large balance in hand. Prices in Muscat, however, ruled high A bag of rice was sold at 12 dollars or over Rs. 18. Wheat ;—Also shows a very respectable increase of Rs. 34,136 or 28 per cent, over last year’s imports. Imports are all from India, as 'those from Kuwait and other Gulf ports have c eased with the traffic in arms and ammunition to pay for which, wheat, in large quantities, was for merly imported from Persian Gulf ports. Bar, Silver This is an illicit trade. This year's imports have amounted to the enormous tigure of Rs. 3,45,750 showing an increase of Rs. 2,84,050 or nearly 83 per cent, over the imports of last year which stood at Rs. 61,700, thus showing that a considerable amount of smuggling to Cutch ports has been going on. The trade is being watched and cases of smuggling which come to the notice of this Consulate are promptly brought to the notice of the authorities concerned in India. , Coffee ;—Also shows an increase of Rs. 88,683 or 22 per cent, over last year’s figures. Imports are all Malabar coffee which is preferred to that from Brazil. It is largely consumed by the Bedouin. Kerosine Oil :—Shows an increase of Rs. 93,548 or 66 per cent, over last year's impoits. Of the total import of Rs. 1,42,588, Rs. 47,510 worth of oil was supplied by the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany of Muhammerah who have now established an agency in Muscat and have occasionally brought consignments in their own steamers. The Stan dard Oil Company of New York supplied oil to the value of Rs. 95,000. Oilman’s Stores Under this head there is a good increase of Rs. 1,66,805 Dr 66 per cent, over the previous year’s figures. The bulk of those imports was for the use of His Majesty’s ships engaged on blockade operations in the Persian Gulf. Twist and yarns Show a considerable increase of Rs. 1,19,580 or 34 per cent. The increase in this article shows that the trade in Muscat manufactured cotton goods is reviving and that notwithstanding the disturbed state of the country it has maintained its own and that Muscat was able to export a little more than last year. Decrease in Imports The following items show decreased imports amounting to Rs. 28,72,063, of which arms and ammunition alone were responsibe for 25,57,963 and cotton goods for Rs. 1,95,604 :— Rs. Arms and ammunition . . , . 25,57,963 Waras (Ochre) 19,270 Ohee 12,868 Sugar (soft) 55,905 Vermicelli ...... 9,729 Cotton goods 1,95*604 Box boards (Shooks) .... 20,724 Total . . 28,72,063 Arms and Ammunition :-The decrease of Rs. 25,57,963 or 12-66 percent, noticed under this head needs little explanation. With the establish ment of the Arms Warehouse in 1912 and the rules and regulations brought into force in connec tion therewith, combined with the strict vigilance of the Navy, the diminution under this head which was anticipated has taken place. Within a year the trade has dwindled to the very low figure of Rs. 2,U2,902 as compared with Rs. 27,60,865 last year. Of the total imports Belgium sent the largest portion, viz., Rs. 1,90,677 and the United Kingdom Rs. 12,225. The cause of the decreased imports in the other articles noted above is attributed to the continued disturbed state of the country which prevented Bedouins from visiting Muscat and exporting to the interior, thereby discouraging fresh imports from India. Waras (Ochre) This is an article mostly used bv the Bedouins but owing to the continued unrest in the interior they did not visit Muscat. The demand for Waras was consequentlv less. Ghee ;—No ghee came from Turkey in Asia during the year and what appears in these returns was imported from India. Soft (sugar) :—The decrease under this head is also due to the disturbed state of the country. Demands for sugar from the interior were small, discouraging large imports from India. Sugar of the value of Rs. 1,58,768 was imported from India, and Belgium supplied Rs. 15,200 worth of this commoditv. Vermicelli : — The decrease under this is due to the large balance of last year’s imports. Cotton Goods :—The reason for the decrease is the same as that given above under ' Waras”. No piece goods were imported direct from America during the year but what appears under Aden represents American goods. It is said that a large stock of American piece goods is always kept in Aden by a Jewish firm which supplies Muscat demands. Indian piece goods have similary suffered to th e extent of Rg. 46,704 and those from United Kingdom to the extent of Rs. 89,050.5 Box Boards (Shooks) : —-No box boards came from America during the year and of wLat appears in these returns Sweden sent Rs. 22,780 worth box boards and the rest came from Germany. Articles not specified The increase shown under this head is due to the inclusion of various articles of Military rations imported from India for the U'-e of the Indian troops stationed at Baital Falaj in the vicinity of Muscat. Imports by sailing vessels : —The import trade carried by sailing craft during the year remained stationary showing an increase of Rs. 6,886 which calls for no special comment. The principal item of import under “ Sailing craft is rice. It shows increased import of Rs. 43,906 and the reason is the same as that given for increased imports of rice under imports by steam vessels. A passing glance at the returns under “ Sailing vessels ” will show that the imports under a good many heads have suffered during the year but as they are comparatively of little importance no detailed explanation is necessary. EXPORTS. Total exports : —The total value of export trade for the year amounted to Rs. 40,73,044 showing a falling off of Rs. 4,49,119 or 11 per cent, as against the increase of the last year of Rs. 1,66 357. The exports by steam vessels have suffered to the extent of Rs. 5,86,818 or 15 per cent., while the exports by sailing craft have improved and show the respectable increase of Rs. 1,37,699 or 48 per cent. The decrease of Rs. 5,86,916 noticed above is entirley due to less export under “ Specie ” which item alone shows a decrease of Rs. 5,96,788 or nearly 55 percent, and the increase noted under a sailing craft is due to the increased smuggling carried in Bar Silver which item shows an increased export of Rs. 1,99,OOU or 83 per cent. Arms and ammunition :—Of the value of Rs. 4,17,861 were exported during the year. Of the total export appearing in these returns the Kuwait share was Rs. 91,373 and Muhammerah and Bunder Abbas together took Rs. 1,03,469 worth of arms and ammunition. An item of Rs. 96,900 appears under Belgium. This represents the value of arms and ammunition re-shipped to Belgium by French merchants. There is another item of Rs. 51,000 under Jibouti which also represents value of goods re-shipped by the French arms dealers. The exports to Kuwait and Persia were covered by Government sanction. It will be observed that the export of arm and ammunition for the year is double that of imports. The explanation of this is that there were large stocks in the Arms Warehouse from last year's imports. Fish;—The export of dry sardines has improv ed and shows the respectable increase of Rs. 31,468 over last year's figures but it will be noticed that there is a corresponding decrease of Rs. 26,627 under Dry and Salted Fish. Owing to the disturbed state of the country the fish industry also suffered as merchants were compelled to sus pend their business. FRUIT. Dates, dry; —Dry dates of the value of Rs. 7,37,495 were exported to India during the year showing an increase of Rs. 1,27,595 or 17 per cent, as against the decrease of Rs. 2,16,09 7 of the previous year. The demand for dry dates in India was great in the beginning of the season and merchants shipped largely anticipating big profits. Wet dates; —Have suffered to the extent of Rs. 88,404 or ) 1 per cent, as against the increase of Rs. 70,452 of the last year. Of the total export Rs. 7,71,181 United States of America took her usual quota amounting to Rs. 3,87,760 and India's share was Rs. 3,31,917, the balance going to Aden and other ports. The date crop was reported good and notwithstanding the disturbed state of the country Muscat was able to export dates (dry and wet) of the value of Rs. 15,08,676, or in other words Rs. 39,191 were more than she did in the previous year, the total export of which year amounted to Rs, 14,69,485. Pomegranates ;—This has improved greatly showing the increased export of Rs. 17,111 or 23 per cent, as against the decrease of Rs. 17,540. Specie;—As noticed above this one item alone has suffered the extent of Rs. 5,96,788 or nearly 55 per cent. The reason for this great loss is not very clear but it is said that it is due to the disturb ed state of the country. Merchants imported less and therefore specie remittances, w'hich principally go to pay for goods imported, were fewer and smaller than in the previous year. Of the total specie exported during the year, viz., Rs. 10,86,133, Arab Coast took Rs. 5,49,200 as against Rs. 5,24,650 of the previous year and India lis. 4,75,933, or in ether words India took Rs. 6,19,538 less than she did during the last year. TEXTLIE FABRIC. (Muscat manufacture) ;—This trade has held it own and although the interior of the cot ntryI 6 was in chaos Muscat was able to export slightly more than in the previous year. Cotton goods (Europe) :—Show an increase of Rs. 25,150 or nearly 30 per cent, over last year's figure which stood at Rs. 60,400. Persia took Rs. 12,250 worth of goods more than she did in previous year and Arab Coast Rs. 3,100. Exports by sailing vessels : —The total ex ports carried by sailing craft during the year are double that carried during the last year showing the respectable increase of Rs. 1,87,699 or 100 i per cent, but if the one item of Rs. 2,39,000 under Bar Silver, which is not legitimate trade, is eleminated from the total exports the result will show that the exports carried by sailing craft have suffered to the extent of Rs 1,00,301. A further glance at the returns under sailing vessels will show that the trade has suffered throughout with the exception of Bar Silver which item alone shows an increased export of Rs. 1,99,000 noticed elsewhere. Openings for new trade :—There are no open ings for new trade. Rates of transport. —The rates of transport depend upon the distance the goods are to be conveyed and the difficulty of the journey. Transport along the coast by native craft is comparatively cheap, but transport in the interior, being on pack animals, is very expensive. Freight and shipping The return attached to this report has been compiled from the register of ships maintained by this Consulate. Only such British sailing vessels as deposited their articles or register are shown therein. Possibly there may have been a few more vessels who called here for water, etc., did not deposit their articles. Figures for the sailing vessels of other nationalities are not available as the Local Customs authorities do not record such information. One hundred and two steam vessels entered the port during the year representing a tonnage of 154,857, of which 100 entered with cargo representing a tonnage of 151,415 and 2 in ballast representing a tonnage of 3,442. Eighty-two steam vessels cleared the port representing a tonnage of 97,109. Of the 82 vessels. 71 cleared with cargo and represent a tonnage of 86,612 and 11 in ballast representing a to nr age of 10,497. Forty-four sailing vessels entered the port with a total tonnage of 3,465. Of the 44 sailing vessels, 29 entered with cargo representing a tonnage of 2,088. The number of sailing vessels that cleared from the port is 38 representing a tonnage of 3,195. Of these, 22 cleared with cargo representing a tonnage of 1,762 and 20 in ballast re presenting a tonnage of 1,744. The lines of steamers mentioned below maintained service from Europe during the year, viz.'.— 4 British, 1 Russian, and 1 German. The British India Company, who have the contract for the carriage of mails from and to India, provide one weekly fast mail service up and down and also a weekly coasting slow mail service both ways. The vessels of the Arab Steamers, Limited, have also maintained a service between Bombay and Basra but at irregular periods. There has been no change in freights during the year and the rates shown in the last year's report hold good. They are quoted below for easy reference : — N ame of article and place.

Introduction *—Muscat is the capital and the chief port of the Sultanate of Oman, which comprises a portion of the south eastern coast of Arabia up to tbe entrance to the Persian Gulf. Muscat is the only port cf call for steamers in Oman, hut ns the town lies at the end of a cstve surrounded by precipitous rocky hills, it has no means of communciation with the interior. Goods destined for the interior have to be taken by small boats to the adjoining town of Muttra about 2 miles up the coast which also has a good anchorage, though more exposed than that of Muscat. Currency .—The currency of the country is the Maria Theresa dollar and the copper coin minted in 1895 to the order of His Highness the Sultan. In Muscat and Muttra sovereigns, Indian currency notes and Indian rupees are generally accepted. The Maria Theresa dollar fluctuates in value considerably being affected by the world price of silver and also by the local demand in the date season, and by the state of the Bahrein pearl market. Trade accounts are kept in Mahomadis and Gaj^ imaginary coins. There are two kinds of Mahomadis—black and white. Black 20£ = 1 dollar and white 11^=1 dollar. The white is used in holesale trade accounts and the black for fruits, vegetables, etc. Most hundis from India show their face value in Mahomadis and not in rupees. 20 Gaj=l Mahomadi. Mahomadis=l dollar. The average monthly rate of exchange between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee varied from Bs. 206 to Rs. 251 per 100 dollars, the lowest being in November 1918 and the highest in March 1919. The following gives the average rates ruling in the local market in each month during the year under report/Rs. 15=£1 :—2 Weights and measures .—The weights used in the Customs Department are now prescribed for use in Muscat, Muttra and the coast towns. They are 1 Kiyas=the weight of 6 dollars or 5*9375 oz. 24 Kiyas=l Muscat Maund. 10 Mauhdsssl Farasala. 200 Maunds—1 Bhar. tj Rice is sold by the bag ; other cer/als by the following measures : — 40 Palis=l Farrah. 20 Farrahs = l Khandi. The rupee^' which weighs one tola, and the dollar, of which the weight is called “ Auki i ’ , are used for weighing drugs and perfumes. One aukia equals eight miskals :—• Measures (Linear). 1 Shibr=l hand of 4J inches. 4 Shibr—1 Dhira or cubit. 4 Dhiras:=l ba’ or fathom. Population and country .—The population of Muscat is estimated at about 10,00 &gt; persons and that of Muttra at about 14,000. These figures are only rough estimates since no statistics are available. Neither of these towns make any 5 pretence at sanitation. The interior of Muscat is for the most part mean and squalid. Muttra, if anything, is worse than Muscat. The interior of Oman is mountainous and the inhabitants for the most part are poor. The population is estimated at about 509,000 of whom a considerable portion are nomads. Public health.—'Phe climate of Muscat is extremely bad, the heat being excessive during the greater parf of the year : a damp heat usually prevails but it is varied by very hot dry winds in May and June. Owing to the notorious climate and lack of sanitation the public health is bad, malarial and other fevers being practically prevalent. The highest temperature recorded in the year was 113*2” and the lowest 62 , 8° F. Agric idture. —A sericulture, chiefly date growing, is the staple inlustry of Oman. But its methods are altogether primitive. Language. The language of the country is Arabic. Hindustani is generally understood and Baluchi commonly spoken among the numerous Baluchis. Cubtoms admin-stration —•tinder the Commercial Treaties with Great Britain and with Fr mce an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent is charged on floods imported into Oman. There are no export duties but a charge of 5 per cent is levied in Muscat and the coast ports on all da f es and other fruits from the interior. Pomegra- nre charged at special rates as an impost on the rebel chief of the Jebel Akhdhar, in whose country the fruit is grown. The Customs Department is under the charge of a Superintendent who is a British Indian subject. The Customs revenues are the mam source of the oultan s income. Other Customs posts exist at Sur, Sib, Barkah, Masnaah, Khaburah and feohar. A 0 Customs returns are published and such as reliable. No returns are kept of exports. Loads and' communications .—Roads do not exist donkeys which are the two beasts of burden. are kept are far from except for camels andOverlings for neic trade .—None exists at present. Bates of transpoi t .—Transport along the coast is dene by_ sailing vessels and is cheap. Transport inland is done by pack animals and is difficult, danger ous and expensive, dke rates of transport depend upon the distance the goods have to be conveyed and the difficulty of the journey. Freight and shipping* —Ti e figures relating to these matters are given in the usual form. They have been obtained from the Consular records and from information supplied through the courtesy of Messrs. W. J. Towell &amp; Co. Steamers .—The port was with the exception of 1 steamer visited only by British ships. The British India Steam Navigation Company mail steamer did not visit the port regularly owing to the dislocation in the steamship service* due to the war. 45 steam vessels entered the port during the year underreport representing a total tonnage of 63,628. 42 vessels cleared the port representing a tonnage of 57,857. 196 sailing vessels representing a tonnage of 21,572 entered the port; 185 sailing vessels representing a tonnage of 20,149 cleared the port. The statement below gives the rates of freight:— Dry dates to India Per ton. Rs. 25 Wet dates to India ... ... 18 Dry fish to India . ••• ... 35 Fresh fruits to India ... • •• 50 Dried limes to Persian Gulf ... • • • 55 General .—The return of imports and exports are ba^ed on the figures compiled from the actual steamer manifests access to which has readily been given by the courtesy of Messrs. W. J. Towell and Company, local agents for most of the shipping companies’ vessels calling at Muscat. No figmes are available from the Customs. Figures for sailing craft entering Muscat and Muttra are compiled from the Consular records. No records are available for the large trade of Sur which possesses some 80 trading dhows voyaging to Basra, India and the coast of Africa, nor for the not inconsiderable trade of the small Batineh coast ports. Competent authority estimates the total trade of these ports as at least half the trade of Muscat and Muttra. During the year under report it would be not far wrong to assume a total trade of Its. 40,00,000 for these ports. This would bring up the total trade of the Sultanate to approximately Rs. 1,20,00,000 for the year.Articles and count'ies from whence imported. Quantity.

Wingate, Esq., I.C-S., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat. Introduction. Muscat is the capital and the chief port of the Sultanate of Oman which theoretically stretches from Dhofar on the southern coast of Arabia up to Ras Musandam at the entrance to the Persian Gulf. Historically with a great past and once a port of the first importance, modern trade conditions and above all the introduction of steam have reduced it to but a shadow of its former self. Formerly due to its geographical position at the entrance of the Persian Gulf and at the south eastern corner of Arabia it formed a great intrepot where goods brought from Rasrah, India or Africa could be off loaded to await the favour able season of the year when they could be carried on to their destinations. It became the great distributing centre for the Gulf, and an important port of call in the Indo-African trade. The introduction of regular steamship services up the Gulf killed Muscat, and though through vested interests and the temporary prosperity brought by the Arms Traffic, the town died hard, at present with the cessation of the latter it is in ruins and almost dead, the population numbers less than 2,000, and the fact that it is still the only port of call for steamers alone prevents its extinction. It is no longer a distributing centre except for the small towns of the Oman coast and for interior Oman, and even in this its place has been largely taken by the neighbouring port of Muttra which has always been the sailing vessel port and which is the starting point for the caravan roads to the interior. As has been stated in previous reports every article brought to Muscat for interior Oman must pass through Muttra. Were steanlers to call at Muttra in the future instead of Muscat, it is possible the latter Would only eSist as a name on the map; Though entitled the Muscat trade report, this report is in actuality a report upon the trade of Oman in which the figures through their known inaccuracy and the fact that they refer only to Muscat are practically useless. It may therefore possibly be of advantage in this short introduction to attempt to give a picture of the conditions prevailing, as other wise the report is liable to give an entirely wrong impression. Oman is an exceedingly mountainous and for Arabia very fertile country with a long coast line, 3 large ports — from North to South Sohar, Muscat — Muttra and Sur and a number of small ones. Its population grows with great skill dates of the first quality, a certain amount of fruit such as mangoes, pomeg*anates and limes with less skill, occasionally wheat and barley when there is sufficient water, with no skill at all and on the coast catches quantities of fish. These articles and firewood are exported, and for them there is a constant demand in India for the dates, fish and pomegranates ; in other ] arts of Arabia for dates, fruit and firewood and in the United States for a special type of Muscat dates. In return is imported rice which is the staple diet of the Arab and piece goods with which he clothes himself. The trade of Muscat therefore is or should be practically constant, varying only with the price of silver and the rainfall. There are no openings for further trade. The people of the interior ai*e exceedingly primitive and enjoy a Government differing little from that of the Prophet's. As far as is known there are no miner als that could be profitably worked. Agricul ture could not be further developed due to the limited quantity of water. Finance due to the primitive method of trade and the necessity for making advances on the date crop in a very insecure country, can only be carried on as it is, that is by the merchants themselves, and a bank2 wonld probably be a complete failure and largely useless. The poverty of the people and their depen dence on the import of rice by the merchant and the sale of their dates also by him place the latter in a position of autocratic power. This position he uses. There are no European traders, and with the exception of the merchants of Sur there are actu ally no Arab merchants of importance. All trade, that is, export and import trade, is in the hands of Indian banias and khojas, who are Bri tish subjects. Again, with the exception of at Sur there are few sailing vessels owned by Arabs, and at this latter port alone survives a remnant of the once far famed Arab traders of Omau. Oman is a perfect example, as were Genoa and Venice in former days, of the decay produced by a change ’of trade routes and methods of trans port. And this process of decay has not yet ceased. The opening up of Dubai on the Pirate coast as a pteamer port has seriously affected Muscat through which it was formerly supplied, and has more than halved the trade of Sohar which only a few years ago supplied the whole Birami oases and Hinterland. Manchester piece goods have killed the local industries, wealth has passed almost entirely into alien hands, and it is prob able that few people in the world have less cause to bless the advance of European civilization than the Arabs of Oman. Currency. The average rate of monthly exchange between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee varied from Rs. *237 to Rs. 256-8 per 100 dollars, the lowest being in August 1919 and the highest in September 1919. The following gives the average rates ruling in the local market in each month during the vear under report Rs. 15=£1.

The weights used in the Customs Depart ment are now prescribed for use in Muscat Muttra and the coast towns. They are 1 Kiyas == the weight of 6 dollars or 5-9375 oz. 24 Kiyas = 1 Muscat mound. 10 Maunds = 1 Farasala. 200 Maunds = 1 Bhar. The currency of the country is the Maria Theresa dollar and the copper coin minted in 1895 to the order of His Highness the Sultan. In Muscat and Muttra sovereigns, Indian cur rency notes and Indian rupees are generally ac- The Maria Theresa dollar fluctuates in value considerably, being affected by the world price o silver and also by the local demand in the date season, and by the state of the Bahrein pearl market. r&lt; ^ ccoun f s are kept in Mahomadis and Gajh imaginary coins. There are two kinds of Mahomadis — black and white. Black 20i = Idollar, and white 11£= 1 dollar. The white is used in wholesale trade accounts and the black for fruits, vegetables, etc. Most hundis from India show their face value in Mahomadis and not in rupees. 20 Gajh = l Mahomadi.

The population of Muscat is probably not more then 2,000, but Muttra has increased consider ably and may be almost 20,000. The majority of the houses in Muscat are empty or in ruins, but building is brisk at Muttra. Sur is an enterprising sailing vassel port of about 12,000 inhabitants and what alone prevents a probable4 ? / increase is the difficulty in obta’ning water. Sohar has shrunk to about 5,000 and is concerned mainly in the export of dates, fruit and firewood. . It is quite impossible to estimate the popula tion of the interior. Inaccessible mountains alternate with fertile valleys. The majority of the population are settled Arabs. Several of the towns such as Nizwa A Rostaq and Nakhl are large and contain for Arabia very good houses. Public Health. The climate of Muscat and Muttra is exceed ingly bad, the hot weather being almost intoler able owing to the excessive heat, while the cold weather though physically it appears plea santer is actually more dangerous owing to the prevalence of a peculiarly virulent type of mala ria. The climate of the interior is however except in a few valleys very healthy and quite bearable. Agriculture. Date growing is the staple industry di the country and in the valleys of the interior whii-h produce the finest types, it is carried out with the greatest skill. The writer has had considerable experience of date growing in Mesopotamia but he has never seen anything to equal the date gardens of Interior Oman. Limes and mangoes are also successfully grown, while pomegranates are the stable product of the Jebel Akhdhar. Cereals are grown when there is a sufficiency of water. Language. The language of the country is Arabic. Hin dustani is generally understood and Baluchi com monly spoken among the numerous Baluchis. Customs Administrations. Under the Commercial Treaties with Great Britain and with France an ad velorem duty of 5 percent is charged on goods imported into Oman. There are no export duties but a charge of 5 per cent is levied iu Muscat and the coast ports on all dates and other fruits from the interior. Pomegranates are charged at special rates as an impost on the rebel chief of the Jebel Akhdhar, in whose country the fruit is grown. (This impost was reduced in October 1920 to 5 per cent as part of the settlement between the Sultan and the Oman Sheikhs). 1919 been completdy reorganised and placed in the hands of trained Egyptian Customs Offi cials. The Sultan's government hope eventually to bring all the customs at outyling ports under the unified central administration. No customs returns are published, but in a few years if the reorganisation should prove successful it is possible that more or less reliable customs returns will be available for the majority of the ports. Roads and Communications. Roads do not exist except for camels and don keys which are the two beasts of burden. It would now be possible for an European trader to proceed inland did he observe the usual Arab precautions, but it is doubtful if his presence would be appreciated or whether it would repay him. Total Trade. The total volume of trade during the year has amounted to £575,608 as against £532,288 of the previous year showing an increase of £13,315 on last year's figures. The above figures include the figures of the Buggalow born etrade which amount ed to £143,628 and represents a decrease of £148,464 on last year's figures. The return to a degree of normality in the steamer service conse quent on the peace, accounts for this decrease. Share of Trade.

This amount includes £101,995 worth imports carried by the Buggalow borne traffic. The main imports are rice* coffee and cotton goods which are responsible for £186,732 of the whole total; sugar, wheat, wheat flour are also largely imported. America and Japan are serious competitors i n piece goods trade though all goods are shown as imported from India whence they are shipped to Muscat. Exports. Total Exports for the year under report amounted to £314,851 as compared with £242,323 last year or an increase of £72,548. This includes £141,628 worth exports carried by the Buggalow borne traffic as against £108,999 last year. Dry and wet dates of the value of £198,100 were expoided during the year under report, the share carried by sailing craft amounts _ to £122,540. The export of wet dates^ to United States of America amounted to £7,560 and to Jndia £50,826. Dry fish, specie, tobacco and firewood were also largely exported, though of the last it is impossible to give any figures. r l he demand for firewood on the Pirate Coast in Bahrein and on the Mekran Coast is high and nearly all comes from the Batinah Coast. Openings for New Trade. None exists at present. Rates of Transport. Transport along the coast is by sailing vessels and is cheap. Transport inland is done by pack animals and is difficult, dangerous and expensive The rates of transport depend upon the distance, the goods have to be conveyed and the difficulty of the journey. Freight and Shipping. The figures relating to these matters are given in the usual form. They have been obtained from the Consular records and from information supplied through the courtesy of Messrs. W. J. Towell &amp; Coy. Steamers. The port was with the exception of one steamer visited only by British Ships. The B. I. S. N.

Figures for sailing craft entering Muscat and Muttra are compiled from the Consular records. No records are available for the large trade of Sur which possesses some 80 trading dhows voyaging to Basrah, India and the coast of Africa, nor for the not inconsiderable trade of small Batineh coast ports.

I have the honour to forward a copy of my report on the trade and commerce of Muscat for the year 1921-22, the original of which has been sent to the Foreign Office, London. A copy has been sent to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. It is requested that. 12 printed copies may be sent me. \ f. ■ | 1‘ AZ2 Us i REPORT ON THE TRADE OF MUSCAT For the year 1921-22. &gt; Introduction. —A reference to Mr. R. E. L. Wingate’s Report on the Trade of Muscat for 1919* 20 is solicited for this purpose. The General Com mercial condition of Muscat has not altered since that report was written. Currency. —The currency of the country is the Maria Theresa dollar and the copper coin minted in 1895 to the order of His Highness the Sultan. In Muscat and Muttra sovereigns, Indian Currency notes and Indian rupees are generally accepted. The Maria Theresa dollar fluctuates in value considerably, being affected by the world price of silver, by the local demand in the date season, and by the state of the Bahrein pearl market. Trade accounts are kept in Mohamadis and Gajh, imaginary coins. There are two kinds of Mohamadis —black and white. Black 20£=1 dollar, and white 11^=1 dollar. The white is used in wholesale trade accounts and the black for fruits, vegetables, etc. Most hundies from India show their face value in Mohamadis and not in rupees. 20 Gajh = 1 Mohamadi. 11£ Mohamadis = 1 dollar. 100 Mohamadis = 1 Toman. The average rate of monthly exchange between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee varied from Rs. 194-9 to Rs. 175-8 per 100 dollars, the lowest being in March 1922 and the highest in August 1921. Tne following gives the average rates ruling in the local market in each month during the year under report. Rs. 15=£1. Rice is sold by the bag ; other cereals by the following measures :— 40 Palis = 1 Farrah. 20 Farrahs— 1 Khandi. 1 The rupee which weighs one tola, and the dollar, of which the weight is called “ Aukia ” are used for weighing drugs and perfumes. One Aukia equals eight miskals :— Measures (Linear). 1 Shibr = 1 hand of 4J inches. 4 Shibr = 1 Dhira or cubit. 4 Dhiras = 1 ba’ or fathom. Bunking. —Due to the primitive method of trade and the necessity for making advances on the date crop in a very insecure country banking can only be carried on by the merchants themselves, and a bank would probably be a complete failure and largely useless. Trade. —The total volume of trade during the year has amounted to £s. 885,506 as against £s. 944,910 of the previous year showing a decrease of £s. 59,404 on last year’s figures. The above figures include the figures of the buggalow-borne trade which amounted to £s. 173,935 and represent a decrease of £s. 61,815 on last year’s figures. This decrease is accounted for by the return to normalcy to a certain extent in the steamer service consequent on the establishment of peace. Share of Trade. —The following table shows the percentage of total trade taken by each country :— Rupees per 100 dollars April 1921 . . 182*4 May *» • . 179 June »» • . 180*5 July M • . 194 August • . 194-9 September „ . . 192-4 October • . 189-3 November • . 188 December . 183 January 1922 . . 175-9 February 99 • . 179-7 March 99 • . 175-8 Weights and Measures. —The weights used in the Customs department are now prescribed for use in Muscat, Muttra and Coast towns.

This amount includes £s. 146,239 worth of imports carried by the buggalow-borne traffic. The main imports are rice, coffee and cotton goods which amounted to £s. 335,069 of the whole total ; sugar, wheat, flour are also largely imported. Although all piece goods are shown as imported from India whence they are shipped to Muscat, Japan and America are serious competitors in this trade. Exports .—Total Exports for the year amounted to £s. 394,076 as compared with £s. 400,0£0 Iasi year, showing a decrease of £s. 6,004. This includes £s. 27,696 worth of exports carried by the buggalcw- borne traffic as against £s. 41,656 last year. Dry and wet dates of the value of £s. 100,191 were exported during the year, the share carried by sailing craft amounts £s. 17,179. The export of wet dates to the United States of America amounted to £s. 11,890 and to India £s. 12,186. Dry fish, specie, tobacco and firewood were also largely exported though of the last it is not possible to give any figures. The demand for firewood in Bahrein and on the Mekran Coast is keen. Legislation and AdministratioiK —Government is of the oriental type tempered by Treaty for the benefit of British Subjects, over w r hom the local authorities have waived jurisdiction. Government is carried on by a Council consisting of four Ministers (President Minister of Finance, Minister of Religious Affairs and Minister of Justice). Cases against British subjects are tried by the Political Agent and His Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, on principles of law 7 adopted from British India. Cases against Muscat subjects are decided by the Council of Ministers but the right of Consular representation exists and is exer cised. Customs Administration .—Reciprocal Commercial treaties have been executed by the Rulers of Oman with Great Britain and France. In accordance with the terms of these all goods imported into Oman are subject to an import duty of 5 per cent ad valorem determined by the price current in the local market. No export duty is levied but a charge of 5 per cent is imposed in Muscat and the Coast ports on all dates and other fruits from the interior. The Customs revenues are the main source of the Government’s income. Transport .—Transport along the Coast is by sailing vessel and is cheap. Transport inland is cirried out by pack animals and is difficult, danger ous and expensive. The rates depend upon the distance the goods have to be conveyed and the difficulty of the journey. No means of development of transport and com munications exist at present owing*^to the exceedingly primitive methods of the people of the country. Natural Resources — Minerals .—As far as is known there fire no minerals that could be profitably worked. Agriculture .—Date growing is the only real in dustry of the country. Limes and mangoes are also successfully grown, while pomegranates are the product of the Jebel Akhdhar. Cereals are grow’n on a small scale and could not be further developed -owing to the limited quantity of water available. Population .—The population of Muscat is about 2,000 and that of Muttra about 20,000. The major ity of the houses in Muscat are empty or are in ruins. Suris a sailing vessel port with a population of about 12,000. The difficulty in obtaining water alone prevents the increase of population there. The population of Sobar has decreased to 5,000 . and is mainly concerned in the export of dates, fruits and firewood. It is quite impossible to estimate the population of the interior. The majority of the population are settled Arabs. Health .—The climate of Muscat is extremely bad, the heat being excessive during the greater part of the year. A damp heat usually prevails but it is varied by very hot winds in May and June. Owing to the poor climate and lack of sanitation the public health is bad, malarial fever being the prevailing disease. The highest temperature recorded in the year w^as 110-3 0 and the lowest 63-0 F. Freight and Shipping. Steamers .—The figures relating to these matters are given in the usual form. The port w r as, with the exception of 2 steamers, visited onlv by British ships during the year under report. The British India Steam Navigation Com pany subsidiary mail steamers visited the port regularly. 75 steamers entered and cleared the port during the year representing a total tonnage of 172,392. 129 Sailing Vessels representing a tonnage of 16,069 entered and cleared the port.

Muscat is the capital of the independent Sukanate of that name situated at the Easterly corner of Arabia. Its seaboard is nearly 900 miles long and extends from Tibbat on the west side of Cape Mus- sendam round Has Sajir rather over 200 miles due north of the island of Socotra, with the exception of a small strip on the East coast of the Mussendam peninsular from Dibbeh to Khor Kalba which is in the administration of the minor Chiefs of Trucial Oman. The Sultanate extends inland to the borders of the Great Desert but of late years the Omanis have become virtually autonomous and are now more subject to the Imam of Oman and his lieutenant Shaikh Isa bin Saleh than to His Highness the Sultan of Oman. The interior is for the most part moun tainous the high country extending down to the sea coast in a series of arid rocky heights though vegeta tion exists on the higher mountains. North-West of Muscat the sea coast littoral tract is fertile and pros perous and date groves extend along it for over 100 miles. This strip is known as the Batinah Coast and it is to here that the hillmen from Oman finding the struggle for existence too keen in the face of a de creasing water supply are gradually descending and forcing out the date and fisher folk. The remainder of the coast with one notable exception is barren and forbidding and rarely visited by Europeans. The exception is Dhofar which is the name of the small fertile district comprising a group of villages at the South-West corner of the Sultanate. Gwadar a port on the Mekran Coast and a small tract of country round it also owns allegiance to Muscat. It is the last remnant of the Omani possessions on the Persian side of the Gulf. The town of Muscat once so important and pros perous has been falling into decay for years now. Most of the trade goes to the sister port of Matrah which is the starting point of the trade route to the interior but Muscat stfil remains the Capital and seat of Government. Currency. The Currency of the country is the Maria Theresa dollar and the copper coin minted in 1895 to the order of His Highness the Sultan. In Muscat and Matrah sovereigns, Indian Currency notes and Indian rupees are generally accepted. The Maria Theresa dollar fluctuates in value con siderably, being affected bj the world price of silver, by the local demand in the date season, and by the state of the Bahrein pearl market. Trade accounts are kept in Mohamadis and Gajh, imaginary coins. There are two kinds of Mohamadis —black and white. Black 20^ = 1 dollar, and white 11£ = 1 dollar. The white is used in wholesale trade accounts and the black for fruit, vegetables, etc. Most hundies from India show their face value in Mohamadis and not in rupees. 20 Gajh = 1 Mohamadi. Ill Mohamadi . . • . =1 dollar. 100 „ .... =1 Toman. The average rate of monthly exchange between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee varied from Rs. 164 to Rs. 189 per 100 dollars, the lowest being in July 1922 and the highest in March 1923.

Banking. There are no Banks in Muscat. The system among merchants of issuing Hundis (drafts) is in vogue and as trade methods are primitive there are no induce ments for a bank to be established. Trade. The total volume of trade during the year under report amounted to £627,360 as against £611,997 in the preceding year showing a net increase of £15,363 or about 3 per cent. Of the above figures goods valued £323,679 were carried by sailing craft and the rest by steam vessels. Share of Trade. Exports. The total value of exports during the year amounted to £184,660 showing an improvement over last year’s figures of £45,641. Exports carried by steamers have amounted to £138,121 and show a goodly increase of £24,464 over last year’s figures. Sailing vessels ex ported goods to the extent of £46,539 which show an increase of £21,177. The increase of £45,641 noticed above is due to increased exports under following items :— Dry sardines Dry dates Dry limes Sugar, soft Total 7,700 20,200 7,700 10,000 45,600 Countries Import Export Total Percent age £ £ £ Africa India . .

Imports. The total imports for the year under review have amounted to £442,700 as against £472,978 for the last year showing a net decrease of £30,278 or about 6-40 per cent, of the total imports. Of the total imports, £67,718 represents imports carried by sail ing craft. 140,243 wnereas tnose carried by sailing craft have suffered to the extent of £79,521. Rice is flhe chief item in which the imports carried by the latter have suffered, in 1921-22 the import of this commodity amounted to £87,297 while in 1922-23, £12,226 worth was imported. Smuggling may account for a fair proportion of this decrease. The last item was imported and re-exported. Fare! Dates. It will be noticed that the export of Fard dates to the United States of America has suffered seriously during the last 2 years ; the figures for this year being less than half those for the previous year. The reason given for diminution in this once flourishing trade is the shortage or almost entire lack of rain and the consequent scarcity of water. The date crop in tte year under review was of the poorest quality and hardly fit for export. Legislation and Administration. The Go\ ernment is of the oriental type tempered by treaty for the benefit of British subjec/ts, over whom the local authorities have waived jui/isdiction* Government is carried on by a Council -consisting of four Ministers (President, Minister of Finance, Minister of Religious Affairs and Minister of Justice).' Cases against British subjects are tried by the Poli tical Agent and His Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, on principles of law adopted from British India. Cases against Muscat subjects are decided by the Council of Ministers but the right of Consular representation exists and is exercised. Customs Administration.

The (ustoms revenue is the main source of the Government’s income. / e3 ■ Transport. Transport along the Coast is by sailing vessel and is cheap. Transport inland is carried out by pack animals and is difficult, dangerous and expensive. The rates depend upon the distance the goods have to be conveyed and the difficulty of the journey. No means of development of transport and com munication exist at present owing to the exceedingly primitive methods of the people of the country. Health. The climate of Muscat is extremely bad, the heat being excessive during the greater part of the year. A damp heat usually prevails but it is varied by very hot winds in May and June, owing to the climate and lack of sanitation the public health is bad, malarial fever being the prevailing disease. The highest temperature recorded in the year was lll'JO and the lowest .73-0° F.. . Natural Resources. Minerals .—As far as is known there are no minerals that could be profitably worked. Agriculture. Date growing is the only real industry of the country. Limes and mangoes are also successfully grown, while pomegranates are the product of the Jebel Akhdhar. Cereals are grown on a small scale and could not be further developed owing to the limited quantity of water available. Population. The population of Muscat is about 2,000 and' that of Matrah about 20,000. The majority of the houses in Muscat are empty or are in ruins, Sur is a sailing vessel port with a population of about 12,000. The difficulty in obtaining water alone prevents the in crease of population there. The population of Sohar has decreased to 5,000 and is mainly concerned in the export of dates, fruits and firewood. It is quite impossible to estimate the population of the interior. The majority of the population are settled Arabs. Freight and Shipping.

Copy to— The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.&gt; REPORT ON THE TRADE OF MUSCAT FOR THE YEAR 1923-24. Introduction. Muscat is the capital of the independent Sultanate of that name situated at the easterly corner of Arabia. Its seaboard is nearly 900 miles long and extends from Tibbat on the west side of Cape Mus- sendam round Has Sajir rather over 200 miles due north of the island of Socotra, with the exception of a small strip on the east coast of the Mussendam peninsular from Dibbeh to Khor Kalba which is the administration of the minor Chiefs of Trucial Oman. The Sultanate extends inland to the borders of the Great Desert, but of late years the Omanis have become virtually autonomous and are now more subject to the Imam of Oman and his lieutenant Shaikh Isa bin Saleh than to His Highness the Sultan of Oman. The interior is for the most part mountain ous, the high country extending down to the sea coast in a series of arid rocky heights though vegetation exists on the higher mountains. North west of Muscat the sea coast littoral tract is fertile and pros perous and date groves extend along it for over 100 miles. This strip is known as the Batinah Coast and it is to here that the hillmen from Oman finding the struggle for existenc too keen in the face of a de creasing water supply are gradually descending and forcing out the date and fisher folk. The remainder of the coast with one notable exception is barren and forbidding and rarely visited by Europeans. The exception is Dhofar which is the name of the small fertile district comprising a group of villages at the south west corner of the Sultanate. Gwadur a port on the Mekran Coast and a small tract of country round it also owns allegiance to Muscat. It is the last remnant of the Omani possessions on the Persian side of the Gulf. The town of Muscat once so important and pros perous has been falling into decay for years now. Most of the trade goes to the sister port of Matrah which is the starting point of the trade route to the interior, but Muscat still remains the Capital and seat of Government. Currency. The Currency of the country is the Maria Theresa dollar and the copper coin minted in 1895 to the order of His Highness the Sultan, in Muscat and Matrah sovereigns, Indian Currency notes and Indian rupees are generally accepted. The Maria Theresa dollar fluctuates in value considerably, being affected by the world price of silver, by the local demand in the date season, and by the state of the Bahrain pearl market. Trade accounts are kept in Mohamadis and Gajh, imaginary coins. There are two kinds of Mohamadis —black and white. Balck 20£= 1 dollar, and white 11£= 1 dollar. The white is used in wholesale trade accounts and the black for fruit, vegetables, etc. Most hundis from India show their face value in Mohamadis and not in rupees. 20 Gajh . . . . =1 Mohamadi. 11£ Mohamadis . . . =1 dollar. 100 Mohamadis . . . =1 Toman. The average rate of monthly exchange between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee varied from Rs. 167 to 186-6 per 100 dollars, the lowest being in March 1923 and the highest in July 1923. The dollar rate fluctuated from Rs. 167 to 186-6 per 100 dollars. It was highest in July 1923 and lowest in March 1924. Weights and Measures. The weights used in the Customs department are now prescribed for use in Muscat, Matrah and the Coast towns. They are :— 1 Kiyas . . .= the weight of 6 dollars or 5-9375 24 Kiyas 10 Mds. 200 Mds. ozs. . . . = 1 Muscat Maund. . . . = 1 Farasala. . . ^ = 1 Bahar.

The export of Fard Dates to the United States of America shows an improvement of £1,645 over last year’s figures. Owing to scarcity of rain the date crops have suffered for several years past. Trade. The total volume of trade during the year under report amounted to £559,855 as against £627,360 in the preceding year, showing a net decrease of £67,505 or about 10 per cent. Of the above figures, goods valued £100,397 were carried by sailing craft. The diminution in value is due chiefly to the fall in prices and that Japanese cloth which is cheap being im ported.

Legislation and Administration. The Government is of the oriental type tempered by treaty for the benefit of British subjects, over whom the local authorities have waived jurisdiction. Government is carried on by a Council consisting of four Ministers (President, Minister of b inance, Minister of Religious Affairs and Minister of Justice). Cases against British subjects are tried by the Political Agent and His Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, on principles of law adopted from British India. Cases against Muscat subjects are decided by the Council of Ministers, but the right of Consular representation exists and is exercised. * Customs Administration. Reciprocal Commercial treaties have been executed by the Rulers of Oman with Great Britain and France. In accordance with the terms of those all goods imported into Oman are subject to an import duty of 5 per cent ad valorem determined by the price current in the local market. No export duty is levied but charge of 5 per cent, is imposed m Muscat and the Coast ports on all dates and other fruits from the interior. . , The Customs revenue is the main source of tne Government’s income. I &lt; f Imports. The total imports for the year under review have amounted to £390 460 as against £442, &lt;00 of the previous year, showing a net decrease of £52,240 or about 12 per cent, of the total imports. Of the above imports £52,793 represents imports carried by sailing craft. A glance at the returns shows that imports carried by steam vessels have suffered to the extent of £37,315 and those carried by the sailing vessels have suffered to the extent of £14,925. Transport. Transport along the Coast is by sailing vessel and is cheap. Transport inland is carried out by pack animals and is difficult, dangerous and expensive. The rates depend upon the distance the goods have to be conveyed and the difficulty of the journey. No means of development of transport and com munication exist at present owing to the exceeding y primitive methods of the people of the country. Exports. The total exports of the year under review have amounted to £169,395 as against £184,660 of last year, showing a net decrease of £15,265. Exports carried by steam vessels amount to £121,791 and those carried by the sailing craft £47,604. The exports by steamers have suffered this year to the extent of £16,330 whereas exports by sailing vessels show an improvement of £1,095. Agriculture.

Introduction. Muscat is the capital of the independent Sultanate of that name situated at the easterly corner of Arabia. Its seaboard is nearly 900 miles long and extends from Tibbat on the west side of Cape Mussendam round Has Sajir rather over 200 miles due north of the island Socotra, with the exception of a small strip on the east coast of the Mussendam peninsula from Dibbeh to Khor Kalba which is the adminis tration of the minor Chiefs of Trucial Oman. The Sultanate extends inland to the borders of the Great Desert, but of late years the Omanis have become virtually autonomous and are now more subject to the Imam of Oman and his lieutenant Shaikh Isa bin Saleh than to His Highness the Sultan of Oman. The interior is for the most part mountainous, the high country extending down to the sea coast in a series of arid rocky heights though vegetation exists on the higher mountains. North-west of Muscat the sea coast littoral tract is fertile and prosperous and date groves extend along it for over 100 miles. This strip is known as the Batineh Coast and it is to here that the hillmen from Oman finding the struggle for existence too keen in the face of a decreasing water supply are gradually descending and forcing out the date and fisher folk. The remainder of the coast with one notable exception is barren and forbidding and rarely visited by Europeans. The exception is Dhofar which is the name of a small fertile district comprising a group of villages at the south-west corner of the Sultanate. Gwadur a port on the Mekran Coast and a small tract of country round it also owns allegiance to Muscat. It is the last remnant of the Omani possessions on the Persian side of the Gulf. The town of Muscat once so important and pros perous has been falling into decay for years now. Most of the trade goes to the sister port of Matrah which is the starting point of the trade route to the interior, but Muscat still remains the Capital and seat of Government. Currency. The Currency of the country is the Maria Theresa dollar and the copper coin minted in 1895 to the order of His Highness the Sultan. In Muscat and Matrah sovereigns, Indian currency notes and Indian rupees are generally accepted. The Maria Theresa dollar fluctuates in value con siderably, being affected by the world price of silver, by the local demand in the date season, and by the state of the Bahrain pearl market.

The dollar rate fluctuated from Rs. 180 to 192 per 100 dollars. It was lowest in September 1924 and highest in November 1924. Weights and Measures.

The total volume of trade for the year 1924-1925 amounted to £6,12,883 as against £5,59,855 of the previous year showing a very modest increase of £53,028 over the previous year or about 9 per cent. The above increase is entirely due to the increased trade with India and United States of America as shown below :— £ India ...... 27,000 United States of America . . . 29,000 Of the total trade for the year under report £1,05,867 represents the share of sailing craft.

Imports. The imports for the year under review amounted to £3,93,374 as against £3,90,460 of the previous year showing an improvement of £2,914 over pre vious year’s imports or about -74 per cent. Sailing craft carried imports to the extent of £66,033 showing the decent increase of £13,240 or about 20 per cent, more than the previous year. The imports of rice by steamer have suffered to the extent of £54,788 and the reason given for this falling off is that the rice market in India ruled high and Muscat demands wefe few. Exports. The total exports for the year amounted to £2,19,509 as against £1,69,395 of the previo s year showing an increase of £50,114 or about 29 per cent. The share of the sailing craft in the year’s exports amounted to £39,834 as against £47,604 of the pre vious year. The increase in exports shown above are entirely due to increased exports carried by the steam vessels. More than half of the above increase was carried to the United States of America. The date crop was better than for several years before and more “ Fard ” dates were exported to United States of America than in several years previously. Legislation. The Government is of the oriental type tempered by treaty for the benefit of British subjects over whom the local authorities have no jurisdiction. The Government is carried on by a Council of 4 Ministers (President, Minister of Justice, Minister of Finance and Minister of Religious affairs). Cases against British subjects are tried by the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, on principles of law adopted from British India Cases against Muscat subjects are decided by the Council of Ministers but the right of Consular repre sentation exists and is exercised. Customs. Reciprocal Commercial treaties have been exer cised by the Rulers of Oman with Great Britain and France. In accordance with the terms of those all goods impo ted into Oman are subject to an import duty of 5 per cent, ad valoretn determined bv the price current in the local market. No export duty is levied but a charge of 5 per cent, is imposed in Muscat and at the Coast ports on all dates and other fruits from the interior. The Customs revenue is the main source of the Government’s income. Transport. Transport along the Coast is by sailing vessel ai)d is cheap. Transport inland is carried out by pack animals and is difficult, dangerous and expensive. The rates depend upon the distance the goods have to be conveyed and the difficulty of the j urney. No means of development of transport and com munication exist at present owing to the exceedingly primitive methods of the people of the country. Agriculture. Date growing is the only real industry of the country. Limes and Mangoes are also successfully grown while pomegranates are the product of ther r Jebel Akhdbar. Cereals are grown on a small scale and could not be further developed owing to the limited quantity of water available. Inadequate rainfall in Oman for several years past has been the cause of ruin of many a date gardens ; all wells have become dry and brackish. Population. The population of Muscat is about 2,000 and that of Matrah about 20,000. The majority of the houses in Muscat are empty or are in ruins. Sur is a sail ing vessel port with 'a population of about 12,000. The difficulty of obtaining water alone prevents the increase of population there. It is quite impossible to estimate the population of the interior. The majority of the population are settled Arabs. Natural Resources. It is hoped that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, who are arranging to prospect for mineral oils in Muscat territory will succeed in working out the mineral resources of the country and thereby increase the country’s revenue. The Company hope to start prospecting in the autumn, 1925. Public Health. The climate of Muscat is extremely unhealthy and the heat is excessive. The highest temperature recorded in the year was IIS’O 0 and the lowest 67-3° F. Shipping. Steamers .—The usual statement showing shipping figures is attached to this report. 115 steam ships of all nationalities entered and cleared the port during the year representing a net tonnage of 339,658 and 47 sailing vessels with a tonnage of 5427 •37. Of the 115 steamships which entered the port 4 were from United States of America, 5 from United Kingdom and 106 from India.

It is requested that 24 printed copies may be sent me.Report on the Trade of Muscat for the year 1925-26 Introduction. Muscat is the capital of the independent Sultanate of that name situated at the easterly corner of Arabia. Its seaboard is nearly 900 miles long and extends from Tibbat on the west side of Cape Mussendam round Ras Sajir rather over 200 miles due north of the island Socotra, with the exception of a small strip on the east coast of the Mussendam peninsula from Dibbeh to Khor Khalba which is the adminis tration of the minor Chiefs of Trucial Oman. The Sultanate extends inland to the borders of the Great Desert, but of late years the Omanis have become virtually autonomous and are now more subject to the Imam of Oman and his lieutenant Shaikh Isa bin Saleh than to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. The interior is for the most part mounta- nous the high country extending down to the sea coast in a series of arid rocky heights though vegeta tion exists on the higher mountains. North-west of Muscat the sea coast littoral tract is fertile and pros perous and date groves extend along it for over 100 miles. This strip is known as the Batineh Coast and it is to here that the hillmen from Oman, finding the struggle for existence too keen in the face of a decreasing water supply, are gradually descending and forcing out the date and fisher folk. The re mainder of the coast with one notable exception is barren and forbidding and rarely visited by Euro peans. The exception is Dhofar which is the name of a small fertile district comprising a group of villages at the south-west corner of the Sultanate. Gwadur, a port on the Mekran Coast, and a small tract of country round it also owns allegiance to Muscat. It is the last remnant of the Omani possessions on the Persian side of the Gulf. The town of Muscat, once so important and pros perous, has been falling into decay for years now. Most of the trade goes to the sister port of Mattrah which is the starting point of the trade route to the interior, but Muscat still remains the capital and seat of Government. Currency. The currency of the country is the Maria Theresa dollar and the copper coin minted in 1895 to the order of His Highness the Sultan. In Muscat and Mattrah Sovereigns, Indian currency notes and Indian rupees are generally accepted. The Maria Theresa dollar fluctuates in value con siderably, being affected by the world price of silver, by the local demand in the date season, and by the state of the Bahrain pearl market. Trade accounts are kept in Mohamadis and Gajh imaginary coins. There are two kinds of Mohamadis «—black and white. Black 20^=1 dollar and white 111=1 dollar. The white is used in wholesale trade accounts and the black for fruit, vegetables, etc. Most Hundis from India show their face value in Mohamadis and not in rupees. 20 Gajh . . . . .1 Mohamadi. 11£ Mohamadis . . . .1 Dollar. 100 „ .... 1 Toman. The average rate of monthly exchange between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee varied from Rs. 156-9 to Rs. 185*5 per 100 dollars, the lowest being in March, 1926 and the highest in April, 1925. The dollar rate fluctuated from Rs. 156-9 to Rs. 185-5 per 100 dollars. It was lowest in March, 1926 and highest in April, 1925. Weights and measures. The weights used in the Customs Department are prescribed in Muscat, Mattrah, and the Coast towns. the weight of 6 dollars or 5-9375 ozs.

The system among the merchants of issuing Hundis (drafts) is in practice and as trade methods are primitive there are not sufficient inducements for a bank to be established.2 Trade. The total volume of trade for the year 1925-26 amounts to £673,817 as against £612,883 of the previous year showing and increase of £60,934 over the previous year or about 10 per cent. The above increase is largely due to the increased import of rice from India, and other goods from the United States of America and other countries as indicated below :— £ India 42,267 United States of America . . . 9,912 Other countries 9,121 Of the total trade for the year under report sailing crafts carried £134,233 worth of imports.

Imports. probably due to the fact that the smuggling of these articles to the Persian Coasts is not so easy as it used to be in former days. A secondary reason is that formerly Cutch merchants used to import sugar into Muscat and then re-export it to the Cutch ports merely to avoid duty. This practice has been dis continued and merchants now import sugar direct iuto Cutch. Exports. Total exports carried by steamships during the year amounted to £177,186 as against £179,675 of the previous year showing a decrease of £2,489. Exports carried by sailing craft amounted to £48,721 showing a slight increase of £8,887 over last year’s figures or about 3 per cent. The export of dry sardines has improved and the result is an increase of £13,647 over last year’s figures whereas the export of dry and wet dates has decreased and shows a falling off of £54,134. The reason is not far to seek. Oman has not had suffi cient rain for over 7 years and date groves have died away for want of water and people of the interior have emigrated to other parts. The produce of dates is yearly becoming poorer in quality and the quantity is diminishing. Poverty in Oman has in creased on account of the absence of rain. Legislation. The Government is of the Oriental type tempered by treaty for the benefit of British subjects over whom the local authorities have no jurisdiction. The Government is carried on by a Council of 4 Ministers (President, Minister of Justice, Minister of Finance and Minister of Religious Affairs). Cases against British subjects are tried by the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, on principles of law adopted from British India. Cases against Muscat subjects are decided by the Council of Ministers but the right of Consular re presentation exists and is exercised. The total imports carried by steamships during the year under report amounted to £362,398 as against £327,341 of the last year showing an improve ment of £35,057 or about 9 per cent. Sailing vessels carried imports to the extent of £85,512 showing an increase of £19,479 over pre vious years or about 6 per cent. Of the above increase more than half is due to in creased imports of rice. The imports of sugar show a decrease of nearly £10,000 and those of piecegoods of over £8,000. One reason for decreases in these two commodities is Customs. Reciprocal commercial treaties have been executed by the ruler of Oman with Great Britain and France. In accordance with the terms of those, all goods imported into Oman are subject to an import duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem determined by the price current in the local market. No export duty is levied but a charge of 5 per cent, is imposed in Muscat and at the Coast ports on all dates and other fruits from the interior. The Customs revenue is the main source of the Government’s income.Transport. Transport along the coast is by sailing vessel and is cheap. Transport inland is carried out by pack animals and is difficult, dangerous and expensive. The rates depend upon the distance the goods have to be conveyed and the difficulty of the journey. No means of development of transport and com munication exist at present owing to the exceedingly primitive methods of the people of the country. Agriculture. Date growing is the only real industry of the country. Limes and Mangoes are also successfully grown while pomegranates are the product of the Jebel Akhdhar. Cereals are grown on a small scale and could not be further developed owing to the limited quantity of water available. Inadequate rainfall in Oman for several years past has been the cause of ruin of many date gardens ; all wells have become dry and brackish. Population. No regular census of the population of Muscat and Mattrah has ever been taken. It is therefore not possible to give correct figures. Owing to the dearth of trade the Indian trading community which in habited the town of Muscat and handled 95 per cent, of the trade have disappeared and almost all their business premises are empty and in ruins. The second port, Mattrah, which has conveniences and communication with the interior of Oman, is now fairly well populated and its trade is much improved as compared to previous years. Natural Resources. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited have carried out a preliminary survey in the Muscat Territory during the year but the prospects of finding mineral resources in paying quantities appear to be very poor. Public Health. The climate of Muscat is extremely unhealthy and the heat is excessive, especially at night. The highest temperature recorded in the year was 111*8 and the lowest 70*2° F. Shipping. Steamers .—The usual statement showing figures is attached to this report. 119 steamships of all nationalities entered and cleared the port during the year representing a net tonnage of 407,076 and 77 sailing vessels with a tonnage of 8,813*77. Of the 119 steamships which entered the port 4 were from the United States of America, 4 from the United Kingdom, 1 from Sweden and 110 from India.

[L 2 St Introduction. I Muscat is the capital of the independent Sultanate of that name situated at the easterly corner of Arabia. Its seaboard is nearly 900 miles long and extends from Tibbat on the west side of Cape Mussendam round Ras Saiir rather over 200 miles due north of the island of Socotra, with the exception of a small strip on the east coast of the Mussendam peninsula from ►l&gt;ibbeh toKhor Khalba which is the administration of the minor Chiefs of Trucial Oman The Sul ; tanate extends inland to the borders of the Great Desert but of la^e years the Omanis have become virtually autonomous and are now mo y e sub J e , ct *° the Imam of Oman and his lieutenant Shaikh Isa bin Saleh than to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. The interior is for the most part mount ainous the high country extending down to the sea coast in a series of arid rocky heights though vegeta- tion exists on the higher mountains. North-west of Muscat the sea coast littoral tract ,s fertile and prosperous and date groves extend a ong it for over 100 miles. This strip is known as the Batmeh Coast and it is to here that the hillmen from Oman, finding the struggle for existence too keen in the face of a decreasing water supply, are gradually d® sce ^ ing and forcing out the date and fisher folk. The remainder of the coast with one notable exception is barren and forbidding and rarely visited by Euro peans. The exception is Dhofar which is the name of a small fertile district cotoprising a group of villages at the south-west corner of the Sultanate. Gwadur, a port on the Mekran Coast, and a small tract of country round it also owns allegiance to Muscat. It is the last remnant of the Omani posses sions on the Persian side of the Gulf. The town of Muscat, once so important and prosperous, has been falling into decay for years now. P Most of the trade goes to the slster J ort Mattrah which is the starting point of the trade route to the interior, but Muscat still remains the capital and seat of Government. Currency. The currency of the country U the Mam Theresa dollar and the copper com minted in 1895 to the order of His Highness the Sultan. In Muscat and Mattrah, sovereigns, Indian currency notes and F Indian rupees are generally accepted. The Maria Theresa dollar fluctuates in value considerably, being afiected by the world price of silver, by the local demand in the date season, and by the state of the Bahrein pearl market. Trade accounts are kept in Mohamadis and Gajh imaginary coins. There are two kinds of Mohamadis —black and white. Black 20^=1 dollar and white 11^=1 dollar. The white is used in wholesale trade accounts and the black for fruits, vegetables, etc. Most Hundis from India show their face value in Mohamadis and not in rupees. 20 Gajh . Ill Mohamadis 100 1 Mohamadi. 1 Dollar. 1 Toman. The average rate of monthly exchange between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee varied from Rs. 128-6 to Rs. 150 per 100 dollars, the lowest being in March 1927 and the highest in June 1926. The dollar rate fluctuated from Rs. 128-4 to Rs. 152-8 per 100 dollars. It was lowest in March 1927 and highest in May 1926. Weights and Measures. The weights used in the Customs Department are prescribed in Muscat, Mattrah and the Coast towns. They are— 1 Kiyas . . 24 „ 10 Maunds 200 the weight of 6 dollars or 5-9375 ozs. Muscat Maund.

The total volume of trade for the year 1926-27 amounted to £474,202 as against £673,817 of the previous year, showing a decrease of £199,615 below the previous year or 30 per cent. The above decrease is largely due to the decreased imports of rice, other cereals, sugar, coffee, cotton goods, twist and yarn from India and other goods from the United States of America and decreased exports of dry fish, dry and wet dates to India and Fard dates to the United States of America as in dicated below :— Imports.

Imports from the United Kingdom show a decrease of £2,928 and export to that country was nil against £6,230 of the previous year. Imports. The imports for the year under review amounted to £326,934 as against £447,910 of the previous year, showing a decrease of £120,976 or 27 per cent. Sailing craft carried imports to the extent of £75,055, showing a decrease of £10,457 or about 14 per cent less than the previous year. The imports of rice by steamers have suffered to^ the extent of £63,188 and the reason for this falling off is that large stocks of rice of previous years were on hand unsold and Muscat demands were few. The imports of sugar show a decrease of £10,702 and those of piece goods £7,037. Decreases ii^h these commodities are due to rigid supervision of th^^ Persian Customs authorities on the Persian ports which makes smuggling of these articles difficult. Another reason is that the Cutch merchants used to import sugar into Muscat and re-export it to Cutch to avoid duty. This practice has been discontinued and now they import it direct into Cutch. Total exports for the year amounted to £147,268 as against £225,907 of the previous year, showing a decrease of £78,639 or about 35 per cent. The share of the sailing vessels in this year’s exports amounted to £15,451 as against £48,721 of the previous year, showing a decrease of £33,270 or about 68 per cent. The export of dry sardines and dry fish by steamers has further improved this year and the result is an increase of £2,348 over last year’s figures, whereas it shows a decrease of £22,630 by sailing vessels. The export of dry and wet dates also has decreased and shows a falling of £50,051. The reason is as stated in the last year’s report, viz., Oman has not had sufficient rain for over 8 years and date groves have died away for want of water and people of the interior have emigrated to other parts. Legislation. The Government is of the Oriental type tempered by treaty for the benefit of British subjects over whom the local authorities have no jurisdiction. The Government is carried on by a Council of four Ministers (President, Minister of Justice, Minister of Finance and Minister of Religious Affairs). Cases against British subjects are tried by the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, on principles of law adopted from British India. Cases against Muscat subjects are decided by the Council of Ministers, but the right of Consular representation exists and is exercised. Customs. Reciprocal commercial treaties have been executed by the Ruler of Oman with Great Britain and France*Natural Resources. In accordance with the terms of those, all goods imported into Oman are subject to an import duty of 5 per cent ad valorem determined by the price current in the local market. No export duty is levied, but a charge of 5 per cent is imposed in Muscat and at the Coast ports on all dates and other fruits from the interior. . The Customs revenue is the main source oi the Government’s income. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, have carried out a preliminary survey in the Muscat Territory during the year, but the prospects of finding mineral resources in paying quantities appear to be very poor. Public Health. Transport. Transport along the coast is by sailing vessel and is cheap. Transport inland is carried out by pack animals and is difficult, dangerous and expensive. The rates depend upon the distance the goods have to be conveyed and the difficulty of the journey. No means of development of transport and com munication exist at present owing to the exceedingly primitive methods of the people of the country. The Local Government is now constructing a road to link up Mattrah with the Batineh Coast ports. A road from Muscat to Mattrah is also under construction. 1 Agriculture. Date growing is the only real industry of the country. Limes and mangoes are also successfullv vrown, while pomegranates are the product of the Jebel Akhdhar. Cereals are grown on a small scale and could not be further developed owing to the limited quantity of water available. Inadequate rainfall in Oman for several years past has been the cause of ruin of many date gardens ; all wells have become dry and brackish. Population. No regular census of the population of Muscat and Mattrah has ever been taken. It is therefore not possible to give correct figures. But it has recently been estimated at 12,580, viz., 4,340 are in Muscat and 8,240 in Mattrah. Owing to the dearth of trade the Indian trading community which inhabited the town of Muscat and handled 95 per cent of the trade have disappeared and almost all their business premises are empty and in ruins. The second port, Mattrah, which has con veniences and communication with the interior of Oman, is now fairly well populated and its trade is much improved as compared to previous years.

Total imports for the year amounted to £370,659 as against £326,934 showing an increase of £43,725 or about 7 per cent. Of the total imports goods worth £241,500 were carried by the steamships and £129,159 by country craft. The import of rice by steamers shows a slight decline whereas the import of the same commodity by sailing craft shows a marked improvement of £45,309. The _ money market , was tight and there was no demand from the interior,for rice of good quality and consequently less rice was imported from Calcutta. The bulk of the rice imported and appearing in these returns came from Karachi. It is cheaper than Calcutta rice and is consumed by the poorer classes both in Muscat^ and in the interior. There has been no direct import of rice from Rangoon but a small quantity of this kind of rice came Vi® Bombay and has been included under India. Exports. Total exports for the year under report amounted to £148,285 of which goods worth £11,652 \fere carried by sailing craft and the balance by steam ships. They show a slight increase of £1,017 over last year's figures. A glance at the statements will show that excepting for the items noted below which, show increased exports the exports to every other country have suffered. Singapore Africa . ,ruf Ceylon . . r . Aden . . £ 3 , 561 / 2,37/ 11,575 1,013 r r Dates were exported to Singapore, cotton goods* locally manufactured, to Zanzibar and Aden, dry fish to Ceylon and Waras (ochre) to Aden. This last item is used for dying clothes by the Arabs. Muscat manufacture turbans and lungis. These are exporf-ed to Zanzibar and Aden. A, consider able e^pqrt of these articles passes through the Rost Office and does not appear in these returns. The export of Fard dates to the United States of America, which is the most important item of Muscat export, has suffered loss for several suc cessive years owing to the absence of rains in Oman. Towards the end of 1927 there was good rain, and it is hoped that the date crop will improve. Legislation. The Government is of the Oriental type tempered by treaty for the benefit of British subjects over whom the local authorities have no jurisdiction. The Government is carried on by a Council of four Ministers (President, Minister of Justice, Minister of Finance and Minister of Religious affairs). Cases agaipsti British subjects are tried by the Political Agent and Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat* on principles of layr adopted from,,British India. Cases against Muscat, subjects are decided by the Cpunpil of,Ministers, but the right of Consular re presentation exists and is exerqised, Custoxns* Reciprocal commercial treaties have begn exe cuted by the ruler of Oman with Great Britain and France, In accordance with the terms of those, all goods imported into Oman are subject to an import duty of 5 per cent, ad mlorem determined by the price current in the local market.

No regular census of the Population of Muscat and Mattrah has even been taken. It is therefore not possible to give correct figures. But it has recently been estimated at 12,580, ?iz., 4,340 are in Muscat and 8,240 in Mattrah. Owing to the dearth of trade the Indian trading community which inhabited the town of Muscat and handled 95 per cent, of the trade have disappeared and almost all their business premises are empty and in ruins. The second port of Mattrah, which has conveniences and communication with the interior of Oman, is now fairly well populated and its trade is much improved as compared to previous years. Public Health. The climate of Muscat is extremely unhealthy and the heat is excessive, especially at night. The highest temperature recorded in the year was 110-2 and the lowest 53-2°. Shipping. Steamers. The usual statement showing figures is attached to this report. 126 steamships of all nationalities entered and cleared the port during the year, representing a net tonnage of 406,093-4 and 107 sailing vessels frith a tonnage of 11,808-48. Of the 126 steamships which entered the port 6 were from the United States of America, 4 from the United Kingdom and 116 from India.

Introduction. Muscat is the capital of the independent Sultanate of that name situated at the easterly corner of Ara bia. Its seaboard is nearly 900 miles long and extends from Tibbat on the west side of Cape Mussen- »am round Ras Sajit rather over 200 miles due north of the island of Socotra, with the exception of a small strip on the east coast of the Mussendam peninsula from Dibbah to Khor Khalba which is in the administration of the minor chiefs of Trucial f Oman. The Sultanate extends inland to the borders of the Great Desert but of late years the Omanis have become virtually autonomous and are now more subject to the Imam of Oman and his lieu tenant Shaikh Isa bin Salih than to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. The interior is for the most part mountainous, the high country extending down to the sea coast in a series of arid rocky heights though vegetation exists on the higher mountains. North-west of Muscat the sea coast littoral tract is fertile and prosperous and date groves extend along it for over 100 miles. This strip is known as the Batineh coast and it is to here that the hillmen from Oman, finding the struggle for existence too keen in the face of a decreasing water supply, are gradually descending and forcing out the date and fisher folk. The remainder of the coast with one notable exception is barren and forbidding and rarely visited by Europeans. The exception is Dhofar which is the name of a small fertile district comprising a group of villages at the south-west corner of the Sultanate. Gwadur, a port on the Mekran Coast, and a small tract of country round it also owns allegiance to Muscat. It is the last remnant of the Omani possessions on the Persian side of the Gulf. The town of Muscat, once so important and prosperous has been falling into decay for years now. Most of the trade goes to the sister port of Mattrah which is the starting point of the trade route to the interior, but Muscat still remains the capital and seat of Government. Currency. The currency of the country is the Maria Theresa dollar and the copper coin minted in 1895 to the order of His Highness the Sultan. In Muscat and Mattrah, sovereigns, Indian currency notes and Indian rupees are generally accepted. The Maria Theresa dollar fluctuates in value con siderably being affected by the world price of silver, by the local demand in the date season, and by the state of the Bahrein pearl market. Trade accounts are kept in Mohamadis and Gajh imaginary coins. There are two kinds of Moha madis—black and white. Black 20^=1 dollar and white 11£=1 dollar. The white is used in whole sale trade accounts and the black for fruits, vege tables, etc. Most hundis from India show their face value in Mohamadis and not in rupees. 20 Gajh . 11$ Mohamadis 100 Mohamadis 1 Mohamadi. 1 dollar. 1 Toman. The average rate of monthly exchange between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupees varied from Rs. 125 to Rs. 13T5 per 100 dollars, the lowest being in March 1929 and the highest in October 1928. The dollar rate fluctuated from Rs. 123*5 to Rs. 13T00 per 100 dollars. It was lowest in March 1929 and highest in October 1928. Weights and Measures. The weights used in the Customs Department are prescribed in Muscat, Mattrah and the Coast towns. They are :— 1 Kiyas . _ . 24 . 10 Muscat Maunds . - 200 _ „ The weight of 6 dollars or 6-9375 ozs. Muscat Maund.' Farasala. Bahr. Rice is sold by the bag ; other cereals by the following measures :— A 40 Palis . 20 Farrahs 1 Farrah. 1 Khandi. The rupee which weighs one tola and the dollar of which the weight is called “ Auqia ” are used for weighing drugs and perfumes. One “ Aukia ” equals eight “ Misqals.” Measures (Linear). 1 Shibr . 4 Shibrs . 4 Dhiras . 1 Hand or 4$ inches. 1 Dhira or cubit. 1 Bah’ or fathom.\ 2 Banking. and is consumed by the poorer classes both in Muscat and in the interior. There are no banks in Muscat. The system among the merchants of issuing Hundis (drafts) is in practice and as trade methods are primitive there are not sufficient inducements for a bank to be established. Trade. The total trade for the year 1928-29 amounted to £510,120 as against £518,944 of the previous year showing a decrease of £8,824 or about 1-70 per cent. Imports by steamers show an increase of £567 whilst imports by sailing vessels a decrease of £27,309. Exports show on the whole an improvement over the figures for last year. Of the total trade for the year the share of the sailing craft is £123,576 and that of steamships £386,544. Share of Trade. — Imports. Exports. Total. Percent age.

Imports. Total Imports for the year amounted to £343,917 as against £370,659 of the previous year showing a decrease of £26,742 or about 7-21 per cent. Of the total Imports goods worth £242,067 were carried by the steamships and £101,850 by country craft. The Import of rice by steamers as well as by sailing vessels shows a decline. The bulk of the rice imported and appearing in these returns came from Karachi. It is cheaper than Calcutta rice Exports. Total exports for the year under report amounted to £166,203 of which goods worth £21,726 were carried by sailing craft and the balance by steam ships. They show an increase of £17,918 over last year’s figures. Cotton goods locally manufactured were exported to Aden, Africa and Zanzibar, dry fish to Ceylon and Waras (ochre) to Aden. This last item is used for dying clothes by the Arabs. Muscat manufactures Turbans and Lungis. These are exported to Zanzibar, Africa and Aden. A considerable export of these articles passes through the Post Office and does not appear in these returns. The Post Office returns for the year under report show that goods worth £6,330 were thus exported. The export of Fard dates to the United States of America amounted to £22,670 as against £10,520 of the previous year or an increase of £12,150. This is due to the good rains we have had during 1927-28. r Legislation. The Government is of the Oriental type tempered by treaty for the benefit of British subjects over whom the local authorities have no jurisdiction. The Government is carried on by a Council of four Ministers (President, Minister of Justice, Minister of Finance and Minister of Religious Affairs). Cases against British subjects are tried by the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, on principles of law adopted from British India. Cases against Muscat subjects are decided by the Council of Ministers, but the right of Consular representation exists and is exercised. Customs. Reciprocal commercial treaties have been execut ed by the ruler of Oman with Great Britain and France. In accordance with the terms of those all goods imported into Oman are subject to an import duty of 5 per cent ad valorem determined by the price current in the local market. No export duty is levied, but a charge of 5 per cent is imposed in Muscat and at the Coast ports on all dates and other fruits from the interior. The Customs revenue is the main source of the Government’s income. Transport. Transport along the coast is by sailing vessels and is cheap. Transport inland is carried out by packMB! 3 animals, and is difficult, dangerous and expensive. The rates depend upon the distance the goods have to be conveyed and the difficulty of the journey.

W The Maria Theresa Dollar fluctuates in value con siderably being affected by the world price of silver, by the local demand in the date season, and by the state of the Bahrein pearl market. • Trade accounts are kept in Mohamadis and Gajh, Laginary coins. There are two kinds of Mohamadis —black and white. Black 20£=1 Dollar.

The Government is carried on by a Council of 4 Ministers (President, Minister of Justice, Minister of Finance and Minister of Religious Adairs). Cases against British subjects are tried by the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, on principles of law adopted from British India. Cases against Muscat Subjects aie decided by the Council of Ministers, but the right of Consular repre sentation exists and is exercised. Customs. Reciprocal commercial treaties have been executed by the Ruler of Oman with Great Britain, United States of America and France. In accrodance with the terms of these all goods imported into Oman are subject to an import duty of 5 per cent ad valorem determined by the price current in the local market. No export duty is levied but a charge of 5 per cent, is imposed in Muscat and at the Coast ports on all dates and other fruits from the interior. The Customs revenue is the main source of the Government’s income. Transport. Transport along the coast is by sailing vessels and is ckea^. Transport inland is carried out by pack animals and is difficult, dangerous and expen sive. The rates depend upon the distance the goods have to be conveyed and the difficulty of the journey. Communications by car has been opened up witli the Batinah Coast through the construction of sr motor road between Muscat and Matrah, and its extension some 30 miles beyond Matrah. Cars can now run some 200 miles up the Batinah Coast to Kalba, and a motor bus runs daily to Sib, some 'M miiea from Muscat. w *3 A rough fair weather motor track has been con structed to bwaklm, about 50 miles, from Muscat.

It is therefore not possible to give exact figures. But it has recently been estimated at 12,580, viz., 4,340 are in Muscat and 8,240 in Matrah. Owing to the dearth of trade the Indian trading community which inhabited the town of Muscat and handled 95 per cent, of the trade have disappeared and almost all their business premises are empty and in ruins. The second port of Matrah, which has conveniences and communication with the interior of Oman, is now fairly Well populated and its trade is much improved. Public Health. The climate of Muscat is somewhat trying, in Jammer the weather is oppressive in May and June ^5ut July, August and the first half of September are not unpleasant tempered as they are by cool monsoon breezes.

Muscat is the Capital of the Independent Sultanate of that name situated at the easterly corner of Arabia. Its seaboard is nearly 900 miles long and extends from Tibbat on the west side of Cape Mussandam round Ras Rajir rather over 200 miles due north of the Island of Socotra, with the excep tion of a small strip of the east coast of the Mussandam Peninsula from Dibbeh to Khor Kalba which is in the administration of the minor chiefs of Trucial Oman. The Sultanate extends inland to the borders of the Great Desert but of late years the Omanis have become autonomous and are now subject to the Imam of Oman and his Lieutenant Sheikh Isa bin Salih. The interior is for the most part mountainous, the high country extending down to the sea coast in a series of arid rocky heights though vegetation exists on the higher mountains. North west of Muscat the sea coast littoral tract is fertile and prosperous and date groves extend along it for over 100 miles. This strip is known as the Batinah Coast. The remainder of the coast with one notable exception is barren and forbidding and rarely visited by Europeans. The exception is Dhofar which is the name of a small fertile district comprising a group of villages at the south-west corner of the Sultanate. Gwadur, a port on the Mekran Coast, and a small tract of country round it, also owns allegi ance to Muscat. It is the last remnant of the Omani possessions on the Persian side of the Gulf. The town of Muscat, once so important and pros perous, has been falling into decay for years now. Most of the trade goes to the sister port of Matrah which is the starting point of the trade to the interior, but Muscat remains the capital and seat of Govern ment. India show their face value in Mohamadis and not in rupees. 20 Gajh 11J Mohamadis . 100 Mohamadis 1 Mohamadi. 1 Dollar. 1 Toman.

Cases against British subjects are tried by the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, on principles of law adopted from British India. Cases against Muscat subjects are decided by the Chief of Justice but the right of Consular representa tion exists and is exercised. Customs. Reciprocal commercial treaties have been executed by the Ruler of Oman with Great Britain, United States of America and France. In accordance with the terms of these all goods imported into Oman are subject to an import duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem determined by the price current in the local market. No export duty is levied but a charge of 5 per cent, is imposed in Muscat and at the Coast ports on all dates and other fruits from the interior.

Communication by car has been opened up with the Batinah Coast through the construction of a motor road between Muscat and Matrah, and its extension some 30 miles beyond Matrah. Ca^s can now run some 200 miles up the Batinah Coas to Kalba, and a motor bus runs daily to Sib som 30 miles from Muscat. ‘V3 A rough fair weather motor track has been con structed to Swakim about 50 miles from Muscat.

The first folio of the volume contains a list of contents that is not entirely accurate. The volume does begin with a report entitled 'Report on the Trade of Oman, Bahrein [
                           sic], and Arab Ports in the Persian Gulf', which is dated 12 April 1904; however, the remainder of the volume contains only the following trade reports:trade reports for Bahrain for the financial years of 1904-1905, 1913-1914, 1916-1917, 1917-1918 and 1919-1920;trade reports for Muscat for 1913-1914, 1918-1919, 1919-1920, 1921-1922 and up to and including 1931-1932.Aside from these reports the volume consists of brief letters and memoranda between the Political Agent, Kuwait, and his corresponding officers in the Gulf, which serve as evidence that the trade reports for the places listed in the contents were received by the Political Agent, even though only the Bahrain and Muscat reports mentioned above are present.Each report relating to Bahrain and Muscat provides a summary of the year's trade. Appended to each report are tables of statistics that contain details of imports and exports (i.e. quantities and values of goods) and shipping returns, not only for the year in question but also for the two preceding financial years.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00001a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
