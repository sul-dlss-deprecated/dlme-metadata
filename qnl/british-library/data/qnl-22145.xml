I was surprised to see from India Office Endorsement Exto 2693 of the 1st July, 1944 that a copy of my letter No. 323-S of the 6th April to Caroe had been ®nt to the Foreign Office. Apart from the fact that •our 1 Consul-General in Bushire and the Foreign Office have nothing to do with Bahrain or its education I had no intention of exposing Belgrave t o criticism from a person such as Dundas and much resent his remarks. Dundas himself struck me as being quite unpractical and with little knowledge of education in the East, and most of Belgrave 1 s objections to his proposals were, as I said in my letter, quite sound, and I saw no reason to override him. Dundas only paid the most fleeting visits to Bahrain, and the difference between a comparatively inexperienced man of this type and the Educational Commissioner to the Government of India who visited me in Alwar is obvious even to a layman. 2. If my letters are to be given such a wide circulation I shall have to be very careful what I put in them. I do not feel that we should tell the world about the defects of Bahrain Government servants, and I checked Wakefield for abusing de Grenier in his diaries. After all %e put them into their jobs; much of thiir' work is done for us : we remove them when they become inefficient, and until that moment arrives we should maintain the same discretion in regard to their shortcomings that we do with our own officers t I am sending a copy of this letter to Caroe. bd*/ G..

Adviserate, October 11, 1944, 755, D.O.tlo. A, xi- /^~ (jjg) A I ara returning the prospectus of the Delhi Polytechnic which 1 have studied, i also passed it on to Hutchings for his opinion. It appears to me that the courses at Delhi are too advanced, too technical and too much concentrated on training men for factory work in India to be of use to us^a place to which we might send some of our boys after they completed their training in our own technical school. In this connection Hutchings has written to me as follows and I am in agreement with his opinion, though in fact it was never suggested that we should model our school on those in India. 'The aims of an institution like Delhi Polytechnic have little in common with those of the simpler technical schools like ours which do not cater for large and varied constructive industries. In India the factory system, covering a wide range of heavy industries, machinery manufacture, textiles, etc. is calling for an army of educated and trained operatives and officials. If the process of industrialisation of the country is to continue a large number of technical schools will be required to give these people their scientific and technological training. The factories themselves are already developing apprenticeship schemes similar to those operating in British industries. These schemes are reckoned to provide most of the practical training of recruits, leaving the technical schools to deal with the scientific background of industrial practice« That is why the syllabuses of study at Delhi would be found so different and so much more advanced than anything we could attempt in a technical school here. Moreover, the Delhi Polytechnic receiv es for its full coursescourses only students who have a good general education up to Indian Matriculation standard. The Technical School in Bahrain is attempting, though not yet very successfully, to meet a very different need. There are no constructive industries with which it has to co-operate and no system of trade apprenticeship to support. It is primarily a school for teaching the elements of mechanical and woodwork practice in a community which is increasingly usin?:- but not producing industrial materials and devices. The school is not likely to be called upon to provide factory industries with specialised trainees. Even the oil industry only offers limited scope for local school-trained technicians because its personnel consists in the main of foreign executives and specialists at the top and unskilled or semi-skilled labour at the bottom, with only a small proportion of intermediate workers of the artisan and technician class. Oil, in short, is not a constructive industry. In view of tl^9e considerations a technical school in Bahrain could not be modelled on the lines of large institutions in industrial countries. In my opinion it should aim at repro ducing a fair range of industrial practice on a small scale as a means of helping the community to make fuller use of industrial products and to maintain them economicaly in accordance with approved standards. Apart from this utilitarian function the (PL&amp;s -i strong emphasis on practic work in the Technical ochool should be counted a valuable cultural element in a system of education which otherwise tends to remain academic nnd remote from everyday- life.'

D.O.Ko.- 'f Bahrain, January 28, 194G. p oiiice '/iliey left Bahrain at the end of the last school terra, in July, there has been no British Director ~ h of Education. I discussed the matter in London with Mr. liussey, the head of the De i artiuent of the British Council dealing with the Persian Gulf, soon after T reached England and 1 understood from him that a man was to be sent from Aden for duty in Bahrain pending a more permanent appointment, Shortly before 1 left .Unglana I was told by Hr. Harrison of the India office that this scheme had fallen through. I called again on Mr. Hussey and saw Kr. Murray, from Baghdad. I understood from them that no arrangement to replace Willey had yet been made but that it might be possible to send someone from Baghdad if a relief could be found for him. The whole position seemed to me to be most unsatisfactory. 2. I have discussed the question with His Highness and Shaikh Abdulla. They consider that it is essential 'chat there should be a British Official in-charge of education in Bahrain and they think that it would now be more desirable that the Director of Education should be a full time State Official, not an employee of the British Council seconded for duty in Bahrain. We do not however wish to sever our connection with the British Council whose assistance in the past hasbeen of such very great value to the State and vve would ap reciate tne continuation of the advice, co-operation and practical help which has always been received from the Council without which the problems of education in Bahrain j\ would be even more difficult to deal with than they are at present. Zj— Confidential.3/— 9{ Li'' 3. On iGarning that no candidate for tae post in Bahrain was forthcoming I made certain enquiries in London with a view to finding someone who might be suitable for the work. I was unable to find a man who combined a knowledge oif Arabic and experience in teaching and administration but I interviewed a Mr. E.J1.0. Downes who apart from the language question appear ;d to be a suitable person for the post. His particulars are as follows Age, 54. Education, 3t. Johns School, Leatherhead, where his father. Canon Downes, was Headmaster, University College, Oxford. From 1933-36 he vvas a master at Malbrough House School, Radley and from 1936-37 at Horris Hill, Newbury. In 1938 and 1939 he was in business. From 1940-45 in the Army, Intel ligence Department., wiitsre he attained the ranlc of Major, serving in Aden, the Red Sea, East Africa, Mauritius and in Ceylon. In his work he was in close contact with the natives of those countries. Married, one small child. Has an ability for languages but has notleanned Arabic. He is fit and above the average in physical attainments. His family is known to me and he was personally recommended by Sir Lionel Smith-Gordon, Bt., a Naval Officer with whom he was working for some time during the war, who is an old friend of mine. 4. I mentioned Downes to Mr. Hussey of the British Council as a possible candidate for Bahrain, Mr. Hussey said that he might consider him for a British Council post in Baghdad but Mr. Downes did not wish to take service with the British Council in Baghdad but would accept, if it were offered to him, the post in Bahrain. 5. If Mr. Downes were considered he could either take a course in Arabic at the London University and come to Bahrain before the beginning of the next term or he couru come out now. If the previous course was aaopted, I myself, for the time being, should have to devote a good deal of time to the schools, I would willingly do this but it is at present impossible for me to afford the time for theproper supervision .v.iich the scliools now require. I have already ascertained that there are various matters connected dth the schools which need iirmiediate attention. 6.

Belgrave, while on leave here, was informed that appointment of Squadron-Leader iviacDonald had fallen through, but made no mention of suggestion to appoint Downes. The issue of the above has been duly authorised.* THE BRITISH COUNCIL 3, Hanover Street, Ext# 615/46♦ London, W.1 • 22nd January 1946• Dear Harrison, This is to confinn our telephone conversation of the 17th January. As you know, we had hoped to post §/Ldr. Grant MacDonald temporarily to Bahrein as Educational Adviser, but this arrangement has fallen through# Since last summer we have interviewed several possible candidates, it being our intention, if a suitable person should be found who had no experience of Arab countries, to post him to our Institute in Cairo for seme months in order for him to get some suitable Middle Eastern experience. However, we were not satisfied by any candidate in this country. In view of this we cabled through you suggesting that the local arrangements made by Highwood should continue for the time being. Highwood, who is the Director of the British Institute in Cairo, had visited Bahrein in order to , report on the situation in October. We have, however, been taking steps to appoint someone in a permanent capacity. We propose to transfer an experienced member of our Iraq staff whom the Iraq Bepresentative, at present in London, considers well fitted for the post. On 15'th January Belgrave called at our office and saw Hussey, .who is Head of the Middle East Department of the British Council. He said that he wished to introduce a young man called Downes, who he thought would be suitable for the Bahrein post. Downes called on us on 17th January and gave us to understand that Belgrave was intending to sound the Sheikh as to the possibility of his paying the whole cost of the appointment, in which case Belgrave would offer him the post. This took us somewhat by surprise as Belgrave had said nothing to indicate Harrison, Esq. , /that e India Office, Whitehall, S.W.1.that the recognised procedure of the nomination to the post « being made by the British Council was being droppedo We were favourably impressed by Downes but consider him to be rather young and inexperienced for the post. If we had considered such a candidate we should have wished to post him for seme months to one of our Middle East Insitutes before sending him to Bahrein. In these circumstances, we should be very grateful if you could discover for us whether we are to proceed by the existi^ machinery for making this Bahrein appointment or whether the Bahrej Government wishes to take the appointment entirely into its own hands. t - The estimates for British Council expenditure in Bahrein have in previous years been drawn up in Cairo and sent to the Political Resident, Ffersian Gulf, for perusal and comnent before j, their despatch to London. This was not done this year because our Middle East Office has been wound-up. The estimates were prepared hastily by Highwood on his return from Bahrein and despatched in letter form to London. As far as we know he did not send a copy of his letter to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, The actual estimates had to be prepared by me in London on the basis of Highwood's letter. They are still in Estimate form, and I am shortly sending a copy to you for favour of your forwarding to the Political Resident. Yours sincerely. (Sgd.) James Livingstone.EXT.1043/46 -n THE BRITISH COUNCIL, 3 HANOVER STREET, LONDON, W. 1. PG/6-1 6-7 6th February, 1946 Dear Harrison, I am enclosing for your information a copy of our Estimates for British Council activities in the Persian G -ulf for 1946/47. Normally, these would have been submitted to the Political Resident, Persian G-ulf before their consideration in London, Previously, we had a fully staffed Middle East Office which prepared these Estimates, but as this Office has now been closed down except for some small departments, the old procedure could not be followed this year. In the circumstances we had to prepare these Estimates in London after we had received a letter of advice from Highwood, the Director of our Cairo Institute who paid a visit to Bahrein in October. It is regretted that they have not been submitted to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf sooner, ?/ill you please forward this copy to him and also a copy of this letter? With regard to the Item PSl/Al, Director of Education, for which a subsidy of £557 is estimated, while the British Council is estimating for this figure in order that it may second a member of its staff to this post during the year 1946/47, the Bahrein G-overnment paying its present contribution, the British Council wishes to suggest to the Bahrein Government that the contribution on its part should be increased. While the British Council is most anxious to help in securing a good man for the post of Director of Education, it would prefer the financial burden to be borne largely or entirely by the Bahrein Government, Our Estimates also include at present the provision of £50 for the purchase of books for Kuwait and of £50 for the purchase of books for Bahrein, The British Council wishes to recommend to the Bahrein G^overnment that they appoint a British Headmaster of the Bahrein Secondary School who could act also as Assistant to the Director of Education. It is suggested that as the post of the Principal of the Technical School is now vacant, the £1,000 p.a, saved could be used by the Government as salary for the new appointment. If the Technical School be controlled by the Director of Education, it is our view that it would not be necessary to replace the Principal. We suggest, also, however, that an English Workshop Instructor be appointed at a salary lower than that of the former Principal of the Technical School to work in the Technical School under the direction of the Director of Education, We have now decided that the functions previously exercised by our Middle East Office in the general supervision of our work in the Persian Gulf and in the preparation of Estimates should be exercised by our Representative in Iraq as from 1st February, 1946.

Persian Gulf Residency, Bushire. Dated 1st February 1946. My dear Harrison, I am desired by Sir Geoffrey Prior to address you on the subject of the actions - or rather the inactions - of the British Council in the Persian Gulf area. Sir Geoffrey has seen their re port for the year 1944-45 and has been struck by the negligible extent of their activities in this area as compared with those in other parts of the world. He observes that the sum total of their contribution to an area where we have vital interests and long standing attachments amounts to about £ 800/- per year, -£ 225/- of this being for books and the rest the Council's contribution to the salary of the Director of Education at Bahrain, whose post the Council have failed to fill since Wakelin left last summer. Furthermore, I am to point out that the Bahrain Government pay £ 500/- towards the pay etc. of the Director of Education and instead of being stirred on by this tribute the Council prefer to do far less than in areas which contribute nothing; while in Kuwait the political authorities have been at great pains to see that the Council representative was well received and given a useful field for work but no attempt has been made to take advantage of the opportunity thus presented. 2. It is clear that the British Council could scarcely have a wider field of influence in the Gulf than the control of education in Bahrain combined with a very wide say in Kuwait, and Sir Geoffrey's conclusion is that their work has been disappointing despite the warm support which has been given them. He trusts that an effort will be maSte to bring home to them the importance of the Gulf area and the necessity of giving it the same careful attention that is being paid to other parts of the globe. Yours sincerely, Sd/- C.J.Pelly. F.A.K. Harrison, Esquire, India Office, London.ORIGINAL ON FILE 32/15 - BAHRAIN GOVIfflNMENT OIL GAUGER. D.O. No.444-2E.

I know what the labour situation is like in England and would suggest that Thompson, the man I propose for Oil Inspector, should be informed by the India 0fice that he is being offered the appointment as otherwise I fear he too may take a post at home.

They should be asked to state definitely and in good time if they will be able to do so, as the Bahrain Government must be given time to make their own arrangements if the Council are unable to make an appointment. 3, Disadvantage of allowing appointment to pass to Bahrain Government is that it would probably saddle State with permanent employee who would lose his usefulness after a few years.

(2) We note that the candidature of Downes for the post of Director of Education, Bahrein has fallen through. We are ourselves attempting to find a suitable man for the post for next autumn. We had been intending to nominate one of our Iraq officials but the man we had thought of is not available. We may now nominate another of our present officials or may propose a fresh appointment. (3) A great difficulty is that the present emoluments attached to the post are insufficient to attract a man of the necessary attainments. This tends to exclude the possibility of a transfer from our staff in Middle Eastern countries as the present allowances for our staff in these countries are higher than those which would be enjoyed by the man filling this post under present arrangements, and as, further, our Middle Eastern staff are well aware of the disadvantages of service in the Persian Gulf, (4) The rate of Local Allowance -which since 1943 we have applied to determine the salary of an official of the British Council seconded to the Bahrein post is 56 per cent tapered. (We have a tapered system of Local Allowance, hereafter referred to as T. L, A. ) This would give a G -rade III bachelor official of age 30, with a basic salary of £490, total emoluments of £737* Together with that he would receive the free partly furnished quarters provided by the Bahrein G-overnment, If the post were upgraded to II, a bachelor official would receive £997, a married and accompanied official would receive £1,204, in addition to free quarters.

Furthermore, it may be considered that in the assessment of Local Allowance some weight should be given to the physical disadvantages of Bahrein as compared with Iraq, (5) We appreciate the point made in your paragraph (3) that there is a political advantage to be gained in the British Council contributing a substantial proportion to the Director of Educations salary, particularly in view of the attitude of the Sheikh of Koweit, Nevertheless, the funds at the British Council 1 s disposal are strictly limited and we understand that the Bahrein Government has ample financial resources, I shall write to you further regarding this matter when ray chief, Hussey, returns from the Middle East, He is expected here about the 24th May, (6)/ ill,Before makin? a nomiiiation far the post we should wish to have it confirmed that an official house vail oe available for the man appointed, (7) lour paragraph (4) refers to our suggestion that the Bahrein Government should appoint a Headmaster o i s Secondary School who might act as Assistant to the Director of Education, tfe have no candidate in mind at present but as the applications for eiiployment now reaching us are more numerous than they were last year, and as they have unproved in quality, we think it probable that we could find a suitable man if reasonable conditions of service were offered.

XX XX XX A great difficulty is that the present emoluments attached to the post are insufficient to attract a man of thenecessary attainments. This tends to exclude the possi bility of a transfer from our staff in Middle Eastern coun tries as the present allowances for our staff in these countries are higher than those which would be enjoyed by the man filling this post under present arrangements, and as, furtner, our Middle Eastern staff are well aware of the dis advantages of service in the Persian Gulf. The rate of Local Allowance which since 1943 we have applied to determine the salary of an official of the British Council seconded to the Bahrein post is 56 per cent tapered, (Wehave a.tapered system of Local Allowance, hereafter referred to as T.L.A.) This would give a Grade III bachelor official of age 30, with a basic salary of £490, total emolu ments of £737. Together with that he would receive the free partly furnished quarters provided by the Bahrain Government. If the post were upgraded to II, a bachelor official would receive £997, a married and accompanied official would receive £1,204, in addition to free quarters. The present arrangement was decided upon in 1943, It was then proposed that the Local Allowance should be the same as that in Iraq, that is 85 per cent, (this was before 'tapering') but it was decided to reduce this to 50 per cent (equivalent of 56 per cent, tapered) in con sideration of the provision of free partly furnished quarters. The Iraq Local Allowance has now been raised to 123 per cent. (T.L.A.) and a proposal is on foot to raise it to.134 per cent. (T.L.A.). As the previous incumbents of the Bahrein post consider that the 56 per cent rate of Tapered Local Allowance payable is inadequate we should like to have the views of the political Resident as to whether the cost of living in Bahrein would justify an increase in our rate of Local Allowance. An increase in the rate to 123 per cent. (T.L.A.) has been suggested, as has also the addition of an Entertainment Allowance. It is also proposed to count free furnished quar ters as equivalent to £210 p.a. rather than to a percentage of the Local Allowance. There is, further, a proposal to rank the post, which is considered an important one, as equal to Grade II in the Council service, previously it was ranked as a Grade III post. The application of the 123 per cent. T.L.A. rate would have effect as follows (a) A man appointed at the bottom of our Grade II, Basic salary £700. Gross emoluments assessed on Tapered Local Allowance (T.L.A.) at Iraq rate (123 per cent) for a married and accom panied man £1,597. To these it is proposed to add:- Entertainment Allowance Basic £100 Augmented by 123 per cent. £123 £223 £1,820 less partly furnished accommodation 210 Net emoluments £1,61011^ -2- (b) It should he noted that if a comparatively inexperienced man were appointed his gross emoluments would be considerably lower. If, for example, we appointed a bachelor of age 30 he would probably be, on appointment, in our Grade III at, say, a basic salary of £490. His emoluments would be worked out as follows (Basic salary Grade III = £490 augmented by 50 per cent, of difference between £490 and £700, as occupying a Grade II post, £105) Gross emoluments on T.L.A. at 123 per cent. for a bachelor.

Your paragraph (4) refers to our suggestion that the Bahrein Government should appoint a Headmaster to its Secondary School who might act as Assistant to the Director of Education. We have no candidate in mind at present but as the applications for employment now reaching us are more numerous than they were last year, and as they have improved in quality, we think it probable that we could find a suit able man if reasonable conditions of service were offered.

Regarding the three points your letter; (a) I cannot comment on the cost of living allowance in Iraq except by stating that throughout the war and now trie cost of living in Iraq has been many times higher than in Bahrain, irac was I believe the second highest country in the Middle East as regards cost of living. I think Bahrain could claim to be the cheapest country during the war. The cost of living allowance granted by the Bahrain G-overnmetit during the war, which is still being paid, is as follows On basic pay not exceeding Rs. 300/- p.m. exceeding Rs. 999/- ' Rs. 1000/- 25% 15 fo The cost of living in Bahrain is now beginning to decrease but this fact is not as apparent as it might be because the bazaar is rapidly becoming stocked with quantities of imported goods, tinned foods etc., which people did without during the war and are now buying. If the Director of Education was a full time Bahrain Government official and a man of experience he would receive a salary of about i^.1000/- per month with allowances, including pro vident Fund, amounting to perhaps another Rs.150/- per month. This I consider should be an indication to the Bri ,ti b ii Council of the suitable r&lt; ■ite of pay for the post in Bahrain. The Bahrain Government does not take into account the fact that an official is married or single and in the case of the Director of Education I would strongly recommend that a bachelor should be appointed. (b) An official house, one of the Law Courts flats, is available, rent free, for the Director of Education. Furniture is supplied but not plate, linen, crockery or hangings. (c) The question of appointing a British Headmaster for the Secondary School is tied up with out future policy of advanced education. Of the boys who were sent to Cairo by the Bahrain Government two were sent back to Bahrain because 2/— BAH: N- OEIPT.tney oecome entangled in political matters and three are now bein^ recalled from Oairo as they are making no progress. Sight of the sixteen boys who^ are at one school failed to pass the examination at tne end of the term, though in most c^ses by a very narrow margin. Four boys from Technical School v;ho are working in the Gairo Technical School are doing well. On the whole His Highness is not satisfied with the results of this experiment. He would like to improve the local standard of education and cease from sending boys to 'Sg^^pt. For this reason ho would like to appoint a' British Headmaster to the Secondary School. It would however be abso lutely essential that the Headmaster should be able to speak Arabic as most of the teaching at the school is in Arabic, It is far more important that the Headmaster of the school should know Arabic than the Director of Education as most of the work of the latter is administrative. If a suitable man could be recommended and made available before the beginning of October His Highness would decide to withdraw most of the boys from Cairo. Regarding terms and conditions for a Headmaster of the Secondary School, would such a person be an official of the British Council seconded for service in Bahrain? In such a case I would like an enquiry to be made from the British Council as to what terms they would suggest. If the Headmaster was a full time Bahrain G-overnment official I would suggest basic pay of about Hs. 700/- to l.s. 800/- per month with usual allowances including a Provident Fund of hs. 100/- per month, free accom modation and annual leave passages to India with a passage from U.K. to Bahrain on first appointment and termination of contract. Owing to the present difficulty in providing accommodation the Headmaster should be a bachelor. Lieut. Colonel A.C. Galloway, O.B.UI., K. B. L ' s Political Agent, Bahrain.1B nOWTD^^TTAT.

I have now consulted the Adviser and my comments are as followss Ca) the cost of living in Bahrain is much lower than in Iraq and would not justify an increase in T.L.A, up to tne rate paid in Iraq. The Bahrain Government pay the following cost of living allowances to their European employees:- Jn basic pa;/ not exceeding 300 p* Jn basic pay not exceeding ,333 p.m. 15;^ On basic pay of and above 1000 p.m. 7iP As an indication of what the Bahrafa Govern- pent would consider a suitable salary ior this )dst, tne Adviser states that the .3a bra in Government would pay an experienced f ill-time Director of Education ibo it . U J ; per mensem, with perhaps another . 150 per ■ iensj^io allowances, including Provident 'und. lie adds that tne Bahrain Government does not take into account whether aa employee is married or single, and he str^ngxy rec^m^^iidb that a bachelor be at)pointed. Personally 1 i t recorr.; jr this, but think that the Adviser's recommendation is la-ae from reasons of lack of accommodation. The A viser also enouires whether the British Council Propose to second an official to Bahrain in the same way as ^aKelln ••■as ssco-idea, that is to say the British Council nays x. 500 -jar annum a id the Bahrain Government rriake up the oaiance ol vuo # e-oluments. I see froa correspondence that this point is still under consideration, vide India Oxxice^-xpress letter d . ixt. ^23/46 dated 2 ;nd . lay 1946 n The point should be settled immediately if an appointment is to be made oy September in time for the school year. (b) the Adviser confirms tnat free quarters ..ill ^ provided. Furniture will be supplied but not plate, linen, crockery, or hangings. (c) the Shaikh is not satisfied with the nrepress Bahraini students are making in Cairo, and wojld prefer' to Improve the gmeral standard of secondary education In Banrain and stop sending boys to .^gypt. As oart 01 tni&lt;. plan ho would like to engage a British ueadmaster lor th_ Secondary School, who would have to &lt;now Arabic as. rao.st oJ tv-f. tPaehin-- at this school is conducted in that lan^.^e.

(d) for a full-time Secondary School Headmaster employed as a Bahrain Government servant the Bahrain^ /D .O.Ncu ~ Adviserate, July 10, 1946 —-'V ^ His Highness, after discussing the matter with Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa and myself, on Saturday decided to withdraw the Bahrain students from Cairo and not to renew the lease of our school hostel there, consequently a telegram has been sent to Wakelin informing him of this decision, 2* Since the matter has been under consideration another of the boys wrote, through Wakelin, asking to be removed from Cairo and V/akelin recommended his return to Bahrain. This boy was the fifth boy to be recalled out of the 22 students who were sent to Egypt and only about half of the boys succeeded in passing their annual Secondary school examination at the end of the term. 3. His Highness wishes now to concentrate more on improving the education in Bahrain than on sending Bahrain boys abroad to be educated, 4. In this connection can you tell me whether the British Council is showing any signs of supplying us with a Director of Education ? Last term I carried on with the assistance of Ahmed Omran, the acting director, who did very good work but this was only possible as a temporary measure. The schools open again on 1st October.

Copy is enclosed of Bahrain Express Letter ^o.G/680 dated the 26th June 1946 embodying the comments of the Political Agent and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government on the points made in Livingstone^ letter to Harrison dated the 13th May 1946. 3. I agree that the coot of living in Bahrain is lower than in Iraq and that it is not necessary to increase the T.L.a* up to the rate paid in Iraq# What is important however is to obtain a Director of Education for Bahrain ;by the autumn. The Pay and allowances suggested in paragraph 2(a) of the enclosure amount to about £ 1000 a year wnich appears to be a reasonable figure. I would suggest that the British Council should adjust their gracie pay and T.L.a . to coincide more or less with this figure. It maices little difference whether a man^s pay is expressed as £ 500 p.a. plus 10Q^ T.L.a . or Rs 1000 p.m. plus dearnese allowance provided he gets apprcxiinately the same amount of money in each case. 1 have little doubt that the Bahrain u-overnment wo uld agree to a small increase in the pay suggested if this is necessary in order to equate it with the British Councils rates of pay and allowances. 4. It will be noted that free quarters will be provided and that the Bahrain Government wish for the appointment of a British Headmaster for their secondary school, vide paragrafhs 2(b) and 2(d). 5. I very much hope it will be possible to find both a British Director of Education and a British Headmaster of the Secondary School for Bahrain by the autumn. As the enclosure shows it is desirable to improve educational facilities in the Gulf in order that it may not be necessary to send so many boy to Egypt or Syria where they are liable to come under bad influences or neglect their studies. 3d.

As regards a Headmaster for the Secondary School, the British Council have no candidate in view at the moment and would have to advertise the post.

The Bahrain Government is willing to accept Mr. Tomlin for the post of Director of Education. 2. Eis salary £.1600 per annum appears to be high in comparison to the salaries of other British officials in Bahrain however the Bahrain Government is prepared to pay £.900 per annum, and to provide the same quarters as were occupied by Mr .v /akelin. It is understood that the^£.900 per annum is consolidated pay and that no additional allowances or payments will be made over this amount to the Director. 3. The Bahrain Government has no objection to the director supervising education in Kuwait and visiting that place once or twice yearly as has been done in the past. It is assumed that on these occasions his fares will not be paid by this Government. 4. Regarding a Headmaster for the secondary school, Eis Highness thinks it would be better to defer this appointment until after the arrival of the new Director of Education but I suggest that the British Council might be asked to keep this post in view and should any suitable applicants be forthcoming to let us know about them. If the British Council v/ould consider contributing a proportion of the pay for this post the Bahrain Government would appre ciate its help and interest but if this is net possible the Bahrain Government would be prepared to pay the whole amount of the headmaster's salary. - / z -*- Captain H.D.E.

The India Office has now replied that the British Council is unable to get Tomlln or any one else out in^time stipulated and have therefore cancelled his appointment pending further discussion. The India Office expects to discuss shortly with the British Council whether anything further can be done and would be glad to have any suggestions e,g, as to whether the Bahrain Government would be likely to accept someone from Cairo on a yea^s secondment pending a permanent appointment. Colonel Hay comments that the term 'someone from Cairo' is very vague but presumes that a British employee of the British Council is meant. On the assumption that this is so he would be grateful if you could obtain and communicate to us with any comment you yourself may have to make, the Bahrain Government's reaction to this suggestion and if you would similarly forward any other it may have to make, Lieutenant Colonel A.

My dear pelly, Will you please refer to your demi-official letter N0 .137-S of the 21st January, 1947? 2. I have discussed the matter with the Adviser and while one Bahrain Government are grateful for the sug gestion they do not require the temporary assistance^ of an ofiiclal trom Cairo on a year's secondment. 3. The trend of the Bahrain Government's educational policy is inclining towards self-sufficiency, and what we have zo decide is whether we should attempt to check this tendency or not, axid if the former, can the British Council make a permanent appointment commencing from the next school year? I think they should be definitely asked thac question, and if that reply is in the negative the Bahrain Government should be urged to make their own arrangements to secure the services of a British director 4. You are fully aware of the rapid development in the oil industry in the Bahrain Agency area which in its train brings employment for Arabs both educated and un educated, That we should retain in Bahrain control of education cannot but be considered as of first importance to our interests as a whole, and were we to lose it I, for one, should consider it disastrous. 5. Whether the Bahrain Government would be prepared to accept a British Council nominee from the next school year I cannot say, in view of the hesitations of the last 18 months, but I, should do what I could to urge them to. First, however, i must know definitely and finally that an official will be available to fill the appointment. An early decision is required otherwise an appointment may be made by the Bahrain Government to change which would entail difficulties. I am taking what steps I can to avoid this.

Regarding furniture, we only provide the actual furniture, tables, chairs, beds etc. not linen, china or carpets, though this particular flat has some floor matting and plain curtains. 4. Regarding the whole question of a Director of Education, His Highxiess and Shaikh Abdulla are definitely opposed to the appointment of a new Director. We have now been working for two years, next June, without a British official in this post and Ahmed Omran, who has been Acting Director since then is in our opinion doing very well and Els Highness thinks that he is capable of carrying on the duties of Director and would have confirmed his appointment were it not that in your D.O. No.c/147 dated 2nd February 1947 you asked that confirmation should be postponed. Another point of view which His Highness 2/ BAHRAIN RECEIPT. jx , 7. ^ /U'.holds is that Bahrain should not have to employ a new Director of Education, which he does not now want, to a certain extent because Kuwait is unwilling to accept a British Director of Education. 5. I would like to suggest that the matter should be reconsidered and that consideration should be given to the possibility ol appointing an Educational Expert for the whole Gulf, with a roving commission, not a Bahrain Government official holding the post of Director of Education to the Bahrain Government. I think His Highness would be willing to contribute towards the cost of such a post, partly perhaps in order to avoid another disturbance in the organisation of education Bahrain. If an arrangement on these lines could be made and a suitable person could be found I believe his services would be of great value. I think that to have a Bahrain Arab at the head of the local administration for running the schools is now more satisfactory than the employment of a British official in this post. The present Acting Director will not remain in the Education Department if he is superceded by a new Director and if a new Director is appointed against the desires of the Shaikhs he will not be given their support and his situation would be difficult. 6. Two years ago the Bahrain Government was very anxious to obtain a new Director of Education and it might be questioned why it now does not want a Director of Education. The reason for this is that in the meantime a local man has been tried out and found to C .J. Pelly, Esquire, O.B.E., I .C.3., K. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain.■ ^ J The 10th of April, 1947.

But, even if he is to biane for letting the ShaiKh's opinion run against us it is our own inability go find a man which has brought things to this pass. Because of this it is difficult for us now to insist on the original proposal bein: carried out, however much we may dislike having to f^ce the fact that we have lost a position (I use the word metaphorically) gained some years ago in the State. All we can now do. I think, is to seize quictily upon the alternative of 'an educational expert for the whole Gulf' offered by Belgrave. I should be glad, thorefore, if I could be authorised to inform him that Colonel nay sxassdtx accepts his suggestion on the understanding that the proposed educational expert would 'oT course'* live in Banrain.

Meanwhile I should be glad to know roughly how much the Bahrain Government would he willing to contribute towards the pay of 'an Edu cational Expert for the whole of the Gulf n and whether they would Drovide for him free of charge the accom modation hitherto reserved for a British Director of Education. I should also be glad to know whether the Bahrain Government wish to pursue their proposal for the appointment of a British headmaster for the Secondary School. 3 # For your own information I consider it unlikely that Kuwait would be willing to contribute to the pay of the proposed educational expert.

Dear Colonel Hay, J ' % I have held up addressing Bel crave as desired in your demi-official letter No.639-3, dated the 18th April, 1947, because I am afraid that the shaikh's decision not to employ a British 'Director of Education will not be reconsidered even if I express your hope to Belgrave that it should be; and I, therefore, venture to suggest that in addressing him as desired by your letter, I omit the expression of that hope. 2. I might, if you think well of it, sound Belgrave verbally as to the possibility of reconsidering the decision, but, as I say, I have little hope of an outcome favourable to us.

We are still without a definite reply from the British Council, though they have told us that they are hopeful that they may be able to find someone from the Egyptian Public Instruction Department. This, I gather, is an Education Department of the Egyptian Government, staffed at least in part by British personnel, whose future, owing to political developments in ..gypt, is not uncertain. The British Council are stil' 1 awaiting a reply from Cairo which should give some suitable recommendation for the Bahrein post 3. We shall continue to press them for an early reply though I see from paragraph 3 of your d.o. letter to Crichton No. f40of IBth ..pri 1 that the Bahrein Government are now setting their face against the appointment of a British Director of Education. British Council miss the bus. months persistently been urging the post. ■ It will be unfortunate if the e have for the last eighteen them to find someone to fill Yours sincerely. :d. E. F.

The 18th of June, 1947. i Dear Sir Rupert, Please refer to our conversation of this morning and to the correspondence ending with your endorsement K0.361-S, dated the 7th of May, 1947. 2. I have spoken to Belgrave, and though he has not seen the Shaikh he thinks that the Bahrain Governiuent would be prepared to contribute Hs. 500/- per mensem to the cost of an Educational Expert for the whole of the Gulf. [t would also probably be able to let him have, free of charge, the accommodation hitherto reserved for the British Director of Education - though not at the present moment. 3. Bel rave thinks, and I agree with him, that the proposal for the appointment of a British headmaster for the secondary School seems impracticable as long as there is no British Educational Adviser; as it would be a very exceptional man who would work harmoniously under the supervision of some one like Ahmed Oiaran.
