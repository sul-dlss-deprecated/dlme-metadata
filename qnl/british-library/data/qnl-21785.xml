For the present, however, and unless any different procedure is subsequently decided on, Muscat should be treated for ell practical purposes in the same manner as the / 5 J S. 6.

The Secretary of State would therefore be glad if, in the case of any prize captured in an Indian State or brought into a port in an Indian State, the 1 o 11 o., r ing procedure could be adopted. (it will oe noted thau uims that suggested in Sir procedure is substantially the same paragraph 6 of Mr. Patrick's demi—olficia.1 lecier to C. Latimer, No.P.Y. 1785/39 of 11th July, v/itn such modifications as are now permissible under the amendment of the Prize Rules, the coniemplation of which was mentioned in that letter). 3 . Ns soon as a capture of a prize is made, the captor will report by telegram direct'to the Admiralty Marshal (telegraphic address - Admarsh London) the fact that the price has been captured, particulars thereof, and that the prize is being held subject to his instructions. *^t one same time a telegram should be sent direct to the Procurator-General (telegraph address - Proctorex London), stating that the prize has been captured, giving particulars thereof, and requesting that proceedings oe immediately begun in London and remitted to the Court in British India (stating the Court). Thereupon the Procurator-General will apply for the necessary order and notify the captor by telegram when this has oeen obtained. The affidavit as,to ship papers should be Prize sworn as provided in Order IV, Rule 1, of the new Court Rules, but the filing of the affidavit should be delayed until notification has been received from the Procurator-General that the proceedings have been remhoted. When making application&gt;for the order for remission, the Procurator-General will apply for an extension of time, for ten days from the date of the order, for the filing^ of the affidavit as to ship papers, and will staiie in his telegram whether, and for how long* the time has oeen^ extended. Upon the receipt of the Procurator-General s^ notification, the affidavit will be filed in the Registry of the Court to which the proceedings have been remitted. Thereafter the prize will be held to the order oi tne Marshal of the Court to v/hich the proceedings have been remitted, and the cax^tor will proceed in all respects the proceedings had been commenced in that Court. a ix 4.

At the Court at Buckingham Palace the 27th day of November, 1939- Present, The King's Most Excellent Majesty in Council. Whereas His Majesty has been compelled to take up arms against Germany in defence of the fundamental right of nations to a free and peaceful existence: And whereas German forces have in numerous cases sunk merchant vessels, British, Allied and neutral, in violation of the rules contained in the Submarine Protocol, 1936, to which Germany is a party: And whereas merchant vessels, British, Allied and neutral, have been sunk by mines laid by German forces indiscriminately and without notification, in contravention of the obligations of humanity and the provisions of the Hague Convention No. VIII of 1907 to which Germany is a party: And whereas the sinking of these vessels has been effected without regard to their nationality or destination or to the nature, ownership or destination of their cargoes: And whereas these acts have already resulted in grave loss of non-combatant life, British, Allied and neutral: And whereas it is manifest that the German Government have deliberately embarked on a policy of endeavouring to destroy all seaborne trade between the Allied and other countries by a ruthless use of the forces at their disposal, contrary to the laws and customs of war, the rights of neutrals and the obliga tions of humanity-: And whereas this action on the part of the German Govern ment gives to His Majesty an unquestionable right of retaliation : And whereas the Allies of His Majesty are associated with Him in the steps now to be announced for restricting further the commerce of Germany:V •*v N. % * 2 Now, therefore. His Majesty is pleased, by and with the advice of His Privy Council, to order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows: — 1 . Every merchant vessel which sailed from any enemy port, including any port in territory under enemy occupation or control, after the 4th day of December, 1939, may be required to discharge in a British or Allied port any goods on board laden in such enemy port. 2. Every merchant vessel which sailed from a port other than an enemy port after the 4th day of December, 1939, having on board goods which are of enemy origin or are enemy property may be required to discharge such goods in a British or Allied port. 3. Goods discharged in a British port under either of the preceding Articles shall be placed in the custody of the Marshal of the Prize Court, and, unless the Court orders them to be requisitioned for the use of His Majesty, shall be detained or sold under the direction of the Court. The proceeds of goods so sold shall be paid into Court. On the conclusion of peace such proceeds and any goods de tained but not sold shall be dealt with in such manner as the Court may in the circumstances deem just; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the payment out of Court of any such proceeds or the release of any goods at any time (a) if it be shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the goods had become neutral property before the date of this Order, or (6) with the consent of the proper officer of the Crown. 4. The law and practice in Prize shall, so far as applicable, be followed in all cases arising under this Order. 5. Nothing in this Order shall affect the liability of any vessel or goods to seizure or condemnation independently of this Order. 6. For the purposes of this Order the words “ goods which are of enemy origin ” shall include goods having their origin in any territory under enemy occupation or control, and the words “ goods which . . . are enemy property ” shall include goods belonging to any person in any such territory. 7. Proceedings under this Order may be taken in any Prize Court having jurisdiction to which the Prize Court Rules, 1939(a), apply. 8 . For the purposes of this Order the words “ British port ” mean any port within the jurisdiction of any Prize Court to which the Prize Court Rules, 1939, apply. Rupert B. Haworth.

A copy of a Press Note on the same subject issued by the Ministry of Economic Warfare on November 28th is also enclosed. 2.- It will be seen that the Order in Council provides for the discharge of German exports in any port within the jurisdiction of any prize court to v/hich the Prize Rules 1939 apply, and the Secretary of State would be glad if the Government of India will co-operate in any case where a merchant ship containing or suspected to contain German exports arrives in any British Indian port. Such steps as are necessary will presumably be taken to apply, so far as it may be applicable, in relation to cases of the above nature occurring in ports of Indian States, the procedure indicated in the Political(lnternal) Department letter No-P.Y.2355/39 of 25th October, 1939. (Sd.)W.D.Croft, Secretary, Economic and Overseas Department. The Secretary to the Gov ernment of India, Commerce Department.(Time of Release 5.0 p.m. Tues,, Nov. 28) The decision of the Allied Governments to take action against enemy exports means that ships outward-bound from Germany or from countries to which Germany has access will now be subject to the same measures of control as inward- bound ships. Shipowners are advised to arrange for their vessels to call at one of the British or french control bases, either at Kirkwall or the Downs, or at Dunkirk or Le Havre, or else, if they are outward-bound from Mediterranean and Black Sea ports, at Malta, Haifa, Port Said or Gibraltar, or at Marseilles or Oran. Vessels which do not call voluntarily at one or other of these bases are liable to be diverted for examination. Bvery endeavour will be made to avoid undue delays to outward-bound shipping in consequence of these measures. Goods which are required to be discharged in British ports on the ground that they are of enemy origin or are enemy property will be placed in the custody of the Marshal of the Prize Court, and unless the Court orders them to be requisitioned for the use of His Majesty will be detained or sold under the direction of the Court if the Court considers that they are in fact of enemy origin or ownership. The proceeds of any goods sold will be paid into Court. These proceeds and any goods detained but not sold will in general remain under the direction of the Court until the conclusion of peace when they will be dealt with as the Court thinks just. But the Court will have the power to order that the proceeds of goods sold should be paid out or that goods should be released at any time (a) if it is shown that the goods have become neutral property before November 27th, 1939, or (b) with the consent of the proper officer of the Crown. As regards (b), requests to the proper officer of the Crown that he should consent to the release of goods or the proceeds of goods of enemy origin which are neutral-owned (but not of goods which are enemy property) will be considered (i) if the goods were on board a vessel which cleared from her last neutral port of departure before December 11th, 1939; (ii) if the contract under which the goods were ordered was entered into prior to November 27th, 1939, and if by its terms the purchaser is obliged to take delivery of the goods on or before shipment, and provided he has paid for them before shipment and the goods were on board a vessel which cleared from her last neutral port of departure before January 1st, 1940. Requests in respect of goods which have been required to be discharged should be addressed, supported by the necessary documentary evidence, to the proper officer of the Crown in the territory concerned. This, in the case of the United Kingdom, would be H. M. Procurator-General, Storey’s Gate ,8. Vv r . 1. and such requests should not be addressed to any other Government Department. Merchants who wish to ensure that their exports from European countries are not delayed or detained are advised t^ obtain Certificates of Origin and Interest from a British or French Consular Officer in the European country concerned. They should arrange for these certificates to accompany the goods on board the vessel. This ./ill greatly facilitate the examination of the vessel at the control bases, and shipowners are therefore strongly advised not to accept cargo not accompanied by such certificates. PRESS SECTION MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC WARFARE 28th November 1939.Confidential D*0. No# C/665-28/*/ Dated the 26th April 1840. Yesterday, April 25th, a Danish tanker 'Eleanora Maersk' arrived off Sitra from Daiyih anchorage (Iran) where she had been since the 17th April and, when boarded by the Naval Officer in Charge, placed herself under British protection. It appears that although the Master had had orders purporting to come from his owners to remain in Iranian waters, the crew had fore* d him to sail to Bahrain. 2. The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, has received instructions from the Commandur-in-Chief, East Indies, to send the tanker under an armed guard to Karachi where she will presumably be taken in prize. 3. If it haa been established that she was actually in Bahrain territorial waters (she anchored just about 3 miles out) I think that strictly speaking I should have detained her in accordance with the instructions contained in your Express letter No. C/754 dtted the I6th November 1939 and should have taken action corresponding to that laid down in India Office letter No. P.Y#2355/39 dated the 25th October 1939. It seemed to me however that this would have led to many complications as, from the papers so far received here in reg&amp;ra to Prize jurisdiction, it is far from clear exactly how or by whom such jurisdiction could be exercised. There would probably have been lengthy delays, possibly preventing her from being put into service under the British flag, and to regard the 'Eleanora Maersk' as 'under naval protection' while being taken to Karachi under an armed naval guard seemed to supply the simplest solution.
