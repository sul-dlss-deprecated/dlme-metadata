From— Colonel F. A. Wilson, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of correspondence ending with my letter No. 22 of the 13th April, I have the honour to forward a letter No. 86 of the 10th April, from the Political Agent at Muscat, discussing the situation as left by the’ recent revolt against the Sultan with its accompanying state of war, and the results to which it may lean; and submitting certain considerations on the course to be adopted, in order to the security of our interests in the future. 2 . Major Sadler, after clearly describing the topographical distribution of the tribes, shows that the Sultan’s power is very limited in extent, and that the attempt to strengthen and extend it by a system of money pay ments^ has been utterly useless, resulting only in impoverishment.* Still Seyyid Feysul s position, though weak, need not be regarded as altogether hopeless, and the support he lately received from a large body of his people might be turned to good account. Though loyal however, he is described as having show n himself obstinate in regard to advice, and notwithstanding the rude awakening he has bad, a radical improvement in his control of a&amp;airs cannot confidently be looked for. In any case, Major Sadler considers that we cannot rely upon the Sultan alone for the protection of our very important interests in the towns of Muscat and Mutrah, in which the wealth, commerce, and property are principally in the hands of British Indian subjects. In this view *1 am disposed to concur, as also in the further opinion that our recent strict neutrality having dissipated any idea that might have existed among the tribes, that our support would be given to the existing autkoritv, further troubles are by no means unlikely. 3. To guard against the risks of this critical position it is proposed— ^ 1 ) to annex Muscat and Mutrah, which would practically involve an extinction of the Sultanate, for no reasonably stable base for it, in the disturbed interior, would be possible;' ( 2 ) to declare a protectorate over Oman. Either of these measures would be of grave moment, and would require a preliminary withdrawal from our convention of 1862 with France, and'I feel some hesitation in expressing my opinion upon them. After careful consider ation, however, I am disposed to favour the second proposal as promising to be less onerous and embarrassing than the other, and equally efficient to^ecure the object aimed at protection for the valuable interests which we have at stake. 4. 1 agree with Major Sadler in the belief that a protectorate would be welcomed by the people generally, and probably also bv the Chief, who could hardly fail to see in the support which he could*secure, by conforming to our advice, a means to the increased stability of his rule. In the existing local and political conditions, there seem also to be several which would be very favourable to such a measure. Interference in the affairs of the interior would be quite unnecessary and could easily be avoided, the tribal life of the Arabs, with its incessant unrest, being matters which would not affect the important interests at the ports. Even here, the influence of the Sultan, more judiciously exerted under our advice, should occasion to offer it arise, would doubtless have a valuable effect in allaying inter-tribal diffi culties, and a gradual amelioration of the constant strife, which has for ages been the normal state, would follow. Muscat and Mutrak are practically independent of the interior which, iu its turn, depends on these ports for most of the necessaries of life, as well as for the export of its produce in exchange for those necessaries. These towns would thus, for ail practical purposes, command the interior, and would at the 1and is exercised in a measure over the tract of country round Nakl, Tao, the Wadi Muawal and Semmayil. The latter is important, as from this valley lead the passes into the S’uarkiyyeh and Oman Proper. Even here the Sultan has lost ground, his policy of non-interference having alienated some of the Ghafiri tribes and brought them more within the influence of Sheikh Salih; last autumn they were dissatisfied at their disputes being referred for settlement to that Sheikh, and it may be owing to this unfortunate policy of the Sultan’s that we find Sheikhs of the Rahbiyeen and Nidabiyeen, the two Ghafiri tribes holding the principal, passes, in co-oper ation with Sheikh Salih in his attack on the Sultan. 4. It is not necessary for me to repeat history and recapitulate the causes which led to the power and control exercised over the tribes of Oman by Seyyid Saeed and his son Seyyid Thoweyni passing from the hands of their successors, till we come to the position sketched in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this report. Suffice it to say that the situation now is not so had as it was in the worst days of Seyyid Turki. The Sultan has not taken advantage of the unusually peaceful state in which he found the country on his accession to consolidate his power, his rule has been weak, and he has tried to avert the hostility of some of the tribes and enlist the good-will of others by a system of cash payments, which would break a far longer purse than his without producing any permanent result. The Arab is only to be controlled by two agents —force and money—the Sultan unable to employ the former had recourse to the latter, and the more lie gave the more was asked. The uselessness of this system of what passes for Government in Arabia was fully shown in the time of the late Sultan Seyyid Tnrki, whose liberal donations to the tribes exhausted his resources, but failed to secure their fidelity. 5. The Sultan’s position, however, weak as it has been shown to be, is not altogether hopeless. Large reinforcements mustered to his assistance in his hour of need, and though they may have answered the Sultan’s summons more with a view to thwart their Hinawi rivals than to actively support their ruler, yet the passive resistance they offered was quite enough to show Sheikh Salih that the object of the rebellion could not be attained, it forced the rebels to come to terms and unquestionably saved the Sultanate. This, as you have remarked, is a force which, if judiciously used, might be turned to great advantage. There are also dissensions amongst the Rinawis, of which the Sultan is well aware, and of which I am advised he will not be slow to take advantage. I may mention two instances :— (a) The jealousy between Sheikh Salih and Sheikh Saeed bin Ali. One of the causes of disagreement between the Sultan and Sheikh Salih was the favour shown by His Highness to Sheikh Saeed, Sheikh Salih rightly or wrongly thinking the Sultan was trying to subvert his influence with the Harth through this Sheikh. (b) The ill-feeling which the Hijriyeen bear towards the Harth on account of the larger presents received by the latter from the Sultan of Zanzibar, which the former attribute to the influence of the U arth and more especially of Hilal bin Aamir with Seyyid Hamad bin Thoweyni; the fact being that the Hijriyeen Sheikhs arrived at Zanzibar after the Sultan had received a caution in the matter of these presents. Moreover the Hijriyeen show a tendency to revert to the Ghafiri faction to which they originally belonged. There is also the fact that Sheikh Salih must to a certain extent be dis credited by the very treacherous and underhand manner in which his late attempt on the Sultanate was made; and also in a manner by the fact that the rebellion failed to gain its declared object, though in this last respect it must be observed that Sheikh Salih has made many unsuccessful attempts on Muscat without losing much of his prestige thereby. 34 6 . Weak ruler though Seyyid Turki was, be threw in his lot entirely With us, he relied implicitly on the British Government, and in his allegiance to it he never wavered; and it is to the support afforded him in recognition of these friendly and loyal feelings that he owed in a great measure the main tenance of his position and his throne. 7 . I fear quite the same cannot be said of the present Sultan. His loyalty has never been questioned, but since the early days of his rule he has shown a disinclination to regard advice tendered him in an amicable spirit from this Agency by my predecessors and myself in the same light of con fidence as his late # ather, whilst lus attitude in connection with several matters affecting British interests has been neither reasonable nor altogether friendly. 8 . This may partly be attributed to ignorance, and a tendency in his disposition to pride and self-conceit which leads him to take his own line regardless of the opinion of those who are willing and able to give him good advice. The fact too may be borne in mind of the easy circumstances under which be succeeded to the Sultanate, and the absence during his reign until lately of those troubles, which were so marked a feature of Saiyid Turki’s life, an ex perience of which might perhaps have taught him the necessity of better appreciating our friendship and assistance. 9 . I have long thought that some lesson was needed, and this has come in the most sudden and violent form. He has seen his capital occupied by his enemies and our assistance, freely given to his father, though under somewhat different circumstances, withheld. Whether late events will have effected a permanent change in the Sultan’s attitude it is too early yet to say; I can only express my hopes that it may be so, and add that 1 have noticed favourable indications of a desire to draw closer to us. 10 . But the fact which I wish to bring prominently to the notice of Government is that, be the character and attitude of the Sultan what they may, the political conditions are neither now, nor are likely to be in the near future, such as to warrant our depending on the unaided efforts of the Sultan for the protection of our interests in the towns of Mufcrah and Muscat. I mean that, if nur subjects are to remain in these iw© towns and carry on their business with security to their persons and property, and if we are to preserve the local trade with India, a policy of neutrality on the next occasion of a rising against the Sultan’s authority will probably fail to secure these objects. 11 . I have already observed that it was mainly to the active support afforded by us to Seyyid Turki that he was able to retain his position and his throne, and 1 consider it to be mainly owing to the belief of the tribes that this support would be continued to his son that Seyyid Feysul owes until lately almost uninterrupted immunity from attack since the commencement of his reign. 12 . But this safeguard exists no longer. Our attitude of inaction which, political considerations apart, was forced on us from the outset of the rebellion by the fact of the town failing at once into the possession of the rebels, practically gave them a free hand in their attempt to seize the Sultanate, and will encourage them to take the same view of the situation in future attempts, if our abstaining*from coercion has not led them to think we were tacitly on their side. We cannot yet surmise what the after effects of the rebellion will be, but I think it may be anticipated that, under present conditions, Oman has not before it a period of rest; indeed it would not be safe to predict that the next few months will pass without further trouble. And when another rising takes place, as some time or other it will, we cannot afford to have a repetition of the incidents which marked the late rebellion.Experience has shown that the Bedouin cannot be restrained for long from pillage and plunder, and once inside the walls there is almost as much to fear from friend as foe; the Sultan is unable to control his allies, the rebel leaders their followers, the chief object of an Arab war being to make off with as much plunder as each side can secure. 13. Tiie remedy for this unsatisfactory state of affairs would, I submit, be found in a change of our policy towards the country. If the present be thought a fitting opportunity for withdrawing from the Convention of 1862 with France, two courses would be open :— (a) To annex Muscat and Mutrah and pension the Sultan. Ibis is such a radical measure that perhaps it need not be seriously considered in this letter. The result to us would be that we should gain a naval position which we practically command already, but with this advantage that we should be able to put it in a proper state of defence, secure the harbour and anchorage and command the trade of the country; in fact create a Persian Gulf Aden, To the Sultan it would mean the loss of the Sultanate, for, wdthout the walls and forts of Muscat, he could not rule Oman for a single day. The country would fall into tw r o divisions—one ruled by Seyyid Ibrahim bin Kais from Kustak, the other by Sheikh Salih from Sammed, the intervening tribes falling under the influence of one or other of these Chiefs. (A) To declare a British protectorate over Oman. I trust it may not be considered presumption on my part if I express the opinion that the time is drawing near when w T e may have to take some step in this direction or the march of events will force it on us. The advance of Russia, the interest taken by that Power and by France in the Persian Gulf, where they have no commercial responsibilities, the gradual extension of Turkish influence over the Arabian peninsular, and the future political conditions of Persia, are all questions in connection with which our future position in the Gulf w ill have to be determined. The hold which a protectorate would give us over Oman and its important harbour and coaling station at Muscat, which could easily be rendered impregnable, w ould materially strengthen that posi tion. Any question of the extension of French influence at Soor or of interfer ence in the politics of Oman wmuld at once be set at rest, and a more effective barrier would be placed in the way of Turkish designs on the country, w hen a more general movement of that nation tow ards Arabia takes place. 14. In the country itself I believe that a British protectorate would be welcomed by the people, botu Minawis and Ghafiris alike, with the exception perhaps of the maritime tribes of Soor, who still continue to traffic in slaves; the people are w’ell disposed towards us, they know our power, and w 7 ould be glad of the rest which a final appeal to an authority whose decision they would not question would give the country. On all sides since the rebellion from the Sultan downwards in Muscat have I beard the same expression of opinion—it behoves the British Govern ment to look into affairs—which can only be interpreted as a desire to see closer relations established between us and Oman, whilst there is a va°-ue feeling abroad that, unless the British Government takes some definite action, the Sultan will not be able to hold his own, and security wdll not be perma nently established in Mutrah and Muscat, where our interests chiefly lay. 15. A protectorate need not necessarily imply an unqualified support of the reigning Sultan against the declared voice of the people, which I may say it w 7 ould be very difficult to ascertain in view of the rivalry existing between the Ghafiri and Hinawi factions; but given that with our support the Sultan ruled moderately w'ell—and his rule has never inclined to undue severity—lm would look on that support as the certain means of his retaining the Sultanate, whilst it would effectually check the designs of ambitious Chiefs like Sheikh Salih bin Ali. We need not interfere in internal affairs more than we mayconsider it necessary to do, though I believe that such is the power of our name in Oman that the exercise of a little tact on the part of a British officer would go far to settle many of the inter-tribal disputes which ordinarily occur. 16. Should the Government of India not favour at present the idea of a protectorate over Oman, I would submit, for consideiation, whether the protection of our interests will not require us to take some active steps when Mutrah and Muscat are again threatened. I have already explained the reasons which in my opinion would require us to adopt this course. With the enemy outside the towns a word from us followed if necessary by a few shells from one of our men-of-war in the har bour, would probably have the effect of dispersing the rebels as it has done before, and saving the property of our subjects from plunder. 17. But the best safeguard would be a clear intimation to the leading Sheikhs of Oman that, whatever differences they may have with their Sultan, we will not permit an attack on Mutrah and Muscat. I am aware that this would imply the active support of the present ruler in the event of a rebel lion against him, but without some such support it is difficult to see how the property of our subjects and their trade are to be protected, whilst such a clear exposition of our intentions would be the surest preventive against a rising, as the Chiefs would know that it would bring them into contact with our power. 18. In return for this support we might demand from the Sultan a closer reliance on us, an earnestness on his part to be willing to be guided by our advice, the right to inspect his fortifications and advise him in the matter of his defences for which we might supply him with a moderate amount of newer arms and ammunition, and lastly a voice in his political relations with the leading Chiefs of the interior. 19. If, on the other hand, it is considered that Seyyid Feysul is not a ruler to whom the Government of India would be willing to accord this measure of support, then we must be prepared to see the property and trade of our subjects placed in jeopardy on every occasion of a rising against bis authority, and bow often this may now happen it is impossible to say. The Sultan can always retire to the forts on an emergency, and unless the enemy are strong enough to invest them and force their capitulation, an arrangement will be come to as in the last rebellion with the result that the principal loss will fall on our people, and that trade will be for the time paralysed. 20. I may add that in both Mutrah and Muscat, our subjects own the principal wealth in merchandise, goods and house property, w'hilst the export and import trade of the country is mainly in their hands. The value of this trade is shown in the last returns as 38 lakhs of dollars, and that is a low estimate. In point of commercial interests, Mutrah and Muscat may now almost be said to be British towns. 6 3 , jre‘.gTL Office Freu JTo. 181 — 17 - 6 . 05 —-ETS.Secret, No. 26.

ENCLOSURES. No. 1. Dated India Office, London, tbo 12th August 1895. From— Sir J. A. Godley, Under-Secretary of State for India, To—The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. ■With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter of the 16th is^Forwarding tudi. kuer, No. 129, of 2 nd July October 1890, and to the papers forward- ed to you on the 2*7th July 1895 + roll- five to the recent rebellion in Maskat, I am desired by Lord George Hamilton to forward herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter from the Government of India, No. 133 Seeref- (External), dated the 9th July 1895, and its enclosures, in which Lord Elgin’s Government discuss the present situation in Oman, and the considerations bv which their future policy should be guided. k J 2. They point out that the authority of the Sultan is limited and feeble that future Iroubles are anticipated, probably at an early date, and that the protection of our important interests in the coast towns of*Maskatand Mattrah cannot safely be left to his unaided efforts. Three plans have been sue-ested for securing the protection of British interests. The first, which involves the annexation of Maskat and Mattrah and the pensioning of the Sultan is not advocated by the local officers, and need not be discussed. u A ? ga f d to ^ the !fc°nd proposal—the establishment of an exclusive British I rotectorate— the Government of India say that they adhere to the views expressed by Lord Lansdowne’s Government; but they recognise that Erance would almost certainly object to the establishment of a British Protec- torate over Oman, and might demand for the abrogation of the An^lo-EVench Declaration of the 10 th March 1862 a price which would be more than the Protectorate is worth. They do not therefore anticipate that Her Maiestv’s Government will think it prudent to open negotiations on the subiect with Erance at the present juncture. J 4. The last course suggested, to which the Government of India incline rs that advised by the Political Agent at Maskat, viz., that the leadin'* Sheikhs ot Oman shoulu he warned that, whatever differences they may have wi'h Mattrah 11 ’ the Go ' Fer “ ment o£ India wil1 not P^mit attacks on Maskat and 5. The Government of India consider this course the more desirable because, as long as they maintain a policy of strict non-intervention, disturb ances are likely to recur; and, unless we take steps to define our position2 there is risk of our becoming involved, however involuntarily, in discussions not only with the Sultan and the tribes, but also with 1 ranee. 6 In the event of the assent of Prance to a British Protectorate over Mask at being unobtainable, Lord George Hamilton proposes that Her Majesty’s Government should undertake to protect Maskat and Mattrah from the attacks of rebel Arab tribesmen in the defence of existing commercial interests. No. 2. Dated Foreign Office, London, the 22nd August 1895. From—S ir T. H. Sanderson, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, To—The Under-Secretary of State for India. The Marquess of Salisbury has had under his consideration your letter of the 12th of August, enclosing copy of a letter, with its enclosures, from the Government of India relative to the present situation m Oman, and the methods proposed for securing the protection of British inteiests. I am directed by His Lordship to state, for the information of Lord George Hamilton, that he concurs in the suggestion made by the Political Agent at Maskat that the leading Sheikhs of Oman should be warned that, whatever differences they may have with their Sultan, the Government of India will not permit attacks on Maskat and Mattrah. Lord Salisbury will be glad to he informed of any steps that^ may he taken for this purpose, and of the exact terms in which the warning is given. Telegram No. 1867-IS., dated the 8th October 1895. From—The Foreign Secretary, Simla, To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Buehire. Her Majesty’s Government have approved issue of warning to leading Oman Sheikhs that, in consideration important British interests, no attack on Maskat Mattrah he allowed in future, whatever differences Sheikhs may have with their Sultan. You are authorised to communicate this to Sultan for notification to Sheikhs; hut Sultan must not consider himself thereby absolved from taking proper measures for protecting these towns. Draft Notification by Sultan to Sheikhs should be approved by you. No. 1891-E., dated Simla, the 12th October 1895 (Confidential). From— Major J.

I am to request that the Government of India may be informed of the exact terms in which the warning is conveyed to the Sheikhs, for communica tion to the Secretary of State. No. 115, dated Bushire, the 10th November 1895, p lom Colonel F. A. Wilson, Political ReekLnt in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. With reference to your telegram of the Sth October, I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, that having proceeded to Maskat, I paid a visit to the Sultan on the 1st instant, and received a return visit on the following day.I communicated to Bis Highness the decision of Government, that having regard to the important British interests at stake in Maskat and Mattrah, no attacks upon those towns would in future be permitted whatever differences might arise between the Sheikhs of Oman and their Ruler. 2. This intimation was not received by the Sultan with the cordial satis faction that I had expected, and I was somewhat surprised to observe that His Highness seemed to regard the policy which I had been directed to announce to him, as a matter of course. Having regard to the fact that whatever the reasons determining this policy, it is evidently of supreme import* ance to him in practically giving to his position and authority the most valuable support of which the circumstances admit, I am at a loss to explain the spirit in which the Sultan appeared to receive the announcement of it. To my further suggestion, in accordance with what I understood to be the views of Government, that occasion should be afforded me to make the communica tion in a more publicly formal manner, in view to its general appreciation, and especially of its unreserved acceptance by the Sheikhs principally concerned, His Highness replied that none of the important Sheikhs, or those especially contemplated being present in Maskat, the necessary arrangements could not at once be made. It was accordingly understood that when certain of the tribal representatives could be assembled, the Political Agent should have an opportunity of repeating the announcement which has already been made to the Sultan. 3. A number of the principal Hindu traders who presented themselves for an interviw w r ith me, expressed lively satisfaction at the present policy of Government, which affords them so valuable an assurance of future immunity from the perils and losses to which they were recently exposed. A copy of their letter, expressing their sense of the benefit secured to them, is enclosed. Dated Mnskat, tbe 4)th November 1895. From—D havji Jivandas, Vikji Ratansi and others, To— Colonel F. A.

With reference to your endorsement No. 109, dated the 16th November 1895,1 have the honour to report that shortly after my return to Maskat, I called on the Sultan and personally informed him of the instructions I had received with regard to the loan. His Highness at once asked me what he should do in the event of his agreeing not, to borrow from any other foreign power and requiring further financial assistance before the present loan is repaid: would Government give him another loan ? To this I replied that I had no instruc tions as to the view Government would take of an application for a further advance before the present loan is fully paid off, but that a consideration^ of the question would doubtless depend on the reasons he advances for making the request, and on hiy then financial position. The Sultan listened attentively to what I had to pommunicate to him and raised no further questions. He told me he would reply to mo by letter, and the impression I gathered from my interview with him was that he would agree to the terms I had mentioned. 2. I have now the honour to enclose copy and translated purport of the communication the Sultan has this day addressed me in the matter, fi'he form in which the requisite assurance is given appears to me, under the circum stances, to be sufficient and to meet the objects that Government has in view. I have accordingly intimated to the Sultan that 1 shall arrange to pay him theyou by this Notification tor beware of any demonstration against Mashat and Mattrah, and this intimation will suffice for you.

Translated purport of a letter from the Sultan of Maskat, to the Political Agent, dated the 15th December 1895 = 27th Jamadi-et-Thani 1513. dffeT' compliments .—Your friend has been pleased with the receipt ol yoin esteemed letter, dated the 14th December 1895 = 26th Jemadi-et-Thani 1313, and has understood its contents, that the Political Resident has approv ed of the notification- and wishes us to circulate it to the Sheikhs of Oman. We have sent it to them as it is worded word for word. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Political Agent just reports that Sultan of Maskat states that assemblage of Sheikhs for warning would involve an expenditure of two thousand dollars. Wishes to postpone to a favourable opportunity. Political Agent recommends this proposal, as the Sheikhs know the fact and have received the news of proclamation issued by Sultan of Maskat. No. 298-E., dated Fort William, the 10th February 1896.

I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram, dated the 31st January 1896, regarding the warning to be given to the Sheikhs of Oman against future attacks on Maskat and Mattrah- 2. It does not appear necessary that the Political Agent at Maskat should wait for a large assemblage of Sheikhs, in order to announce to them that attacks on Maskat and Mattrah will not be permitted by the British Govern- mont. It will suffice if the Political Agent takes the opportunity, whenever a Sheikh of any importance visits Maskat, to impress on him the warning referred to. I am to request that the Political Agent may he instructed accord ingly. Telegram, dated the 31st January iS96. Eid.—J. E. F, Government of India Centra) Printing Office —No 734 F.

With regard to the second proposal- the Establish- - men t of an exclus i ve Tri t i sh Pro tectorate- the Government of India say that they adhere to the views expressed hy Lord Lansdowne*s Government;but they recognise that France would almost certainly object to the establishment of a British Protectorate over Oman t and might demand for the abrogation of the Anglo-French Declaration of the 10th 'larch ISSf a price which would he more than the Protectorate is worth.
