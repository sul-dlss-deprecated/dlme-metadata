ENCLOSURE IN COLONIAL OPPICE COVERING LETTER DATED 31st JULY 1933. 18301/33. 31st July 1933. |p 4 j. f | Lf .y Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe- Lister to refer to the letter from this Department (No. 18135/11/33) of the 11th of my and to your reply f (No.I &amp; M 17486) ot the 18th of toy regarding the Bahrein V Petroleum Company's oil concession in Bahrein, ana to inform you that further questions have arisen in connection with this concession upon which your advice is desired. 2. The points on which your advice is sought arise out of Condition C scheduled to the Indenture of the 12th of June 1930, a copy of which accompanied the Colonial Office letter under reference. A copy of Condition C is, on however, enclosed with this letter for ease of reference. By this Condition, the Bahrein Petroleum Company are required to maintain at all times in Bahrein an official to he styled the Company's 'Chief Local Representative', whose appointment shall he approved hy His iviajesty's Government, who shall he the sole representative of the Company empowered to deal airect with the local authorities and population in Bahrein, and who shall communicate with the sheikh of Bahrein only through the British Political Agent in Bahrein. Die Condition goes on to provide that for the first five years after the Company starts to operate in Bahrein, or for such lesser period as the Company may operate in that territory, their/ TREASURY SOLICITOR.4/ tneir 'Gtiief Local Representative' 1 shall 'be fejor Prank Holmes, provided that the arrangement between the Company and iajor Holmes continues to he mutually satisfactory and provided that the determination of his appointment shall he subject to the consent of His Majesty's Government. 3. It should be explained that His Majesty's Government attached considerable importance to the Company 1 , Ghief Local Representative being a British subject. This was considered most desirable not only to ensure harmonious relations between the Company exploiting the concession ana the Bahrein! population and the local authorities, but also because of tne special treaty relations existing between His Iv^ajesty's Government and the Sheikh of Bahrein in view of which His Majesty's Government were anxious that the Company's Ghief Local Representative should be a British subject who would be persona grata to His Majesty's Government. This was explained at the time to representatives of tiia American interests, to whom the concession was being assigned, and who were anxious to appoint a United States citizen as the Chief Local Representative. A compromise was eventually reached where, although Condition C did not state in terms that the Company's Chief Local Representative should be a British subject, Mxjor Holmes, ^ho is a British subject, should be appointed to the post for the first five years. A further reason actuated His tejesty's Government in Insisting upon the inclusion of such a provision in the conuxtlons attaching to their consent to the assignment of the Bahrein oil Concession to American Interests, namely, t s in the caoe of Conditions A and. B it was desired to safeguard so far as practicable, the interests of His wiajesty 1 s Government.4, unfortunately, the arrangement has not turned out satisfactorily ironi the^polnt of view of His Iviajesty s Govemment. tejor Holmes has irequently and for long periods absented himself from Bahrein, and has on one occasion at least failed to comply with the provision that he should communicate with the Sheikh only through the Political'Agent at Bahrein, Moreover, he has taken advantage of his absences from Bahrein to engage in other activities, unconnected with his duties in Bahrein, which have teen the cause of considerahle embarrassment to His iviajesty's Government in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere. A note is attached to this letter setting out in more detail the grounds of complaint against Major Holmes. 5, In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government have, for some time had under consideration the possibility of taking steps either to compel Lajor Holmes to confine himself to carrying out his duties in Bahrein within the terms of Condition G, or to securing his replacement by some other more satisfactory inaiviaual. To this end, it has been necessary for His imjesty^ % Government to examine their precise position under Condition C. The view taken is that the wording of the Condition is open only to the natural construction that the Company*s Chief Local Representative should spend his whole time in Bahrein (with a reasonable period of annual leave for purposes of health, which should be spent in a oetter climate than that of the Gulf). He should, in any case, be at hand when business has to be transacted with the local authorities, or negotiations conducted with the ;J:ieikh of Bahrein, whether such business or negotiations a re initiated by the concessionnaires or by the other party. It may also be held to be implicit in the Condition that/vV . 4 - that the Ghiel Local Representative, who is to he persona grata to His Majesty's Government, should to some extent hold a watching hrief for His Majesty's Government, or at least constitute himself a safeguard against things 'being done hy the Com^ny at Bahrein which His Majesty's Government would not approve, 6* In August 1932, the question of Major Holmes^ absences from Bahrein was taken up with the Company, when they were asked whether they would give an assurance that Major Holmes wouia reside in Bahrein for a minimum period of nine months each year. After oral discussions with the Company's representative in London, a reply was received to the effect that the Chief Local Representative had 'been in Bahrein at all times required oy the Company for communications with the Sheikh and the local authorities, ana expressing the view that, waile Condition C decides the medium of approach, it leaves to the Company 'as necessarily it must*, the decision whan and for what purposes the company should approach the local authorities. A copy of the correspondence with the Company is enclosed with this letter. A corollary Bahrein Pet.Col.8th Aug. 1 32 do. 3rd FeD, f 33 ) to the Company's interpretation ' mm mm — — mmmmmmm.imm'mmmrmm'mimmm. of Condition G, (which in fact the Company's representative in London has asserted orally) is that no violation of the Condition would have taken place if at any time the local authorities, or the Sheikh, desired to transact business with the Chief Local Representative and the latter was absent from Bahrein. ^* Before pursuing the matter further with the Company, it is desired to clarify the legal position under Condition C, and I am a ccordingly to request that you/A- - 5 - you will 'be good enough to furnish your advice on the following points. (a) The correct interpretation of the phrase 11 at all times maintain in Bahrein'; i«e. aoes this mean that the Chief Local Representative should spend his whole time in Bahrein, with a reasomble period for leave, or that he need only he in Banrein when required to transact 'business or conduct negotiations? (h) If the latter interpretation is correct, does this mean mat ne need only be in Bahrein to transact business or conduct negotiations wiien x-euulred by tne Company ? (c) Vftiether it can reasonably be argued, In view of the considerations mentioned in paragraph 3 above, that it was implied in the arrangement embodied in Condition G that the Chief Local Representative, who must be approved by His - Majesty's Government, should to some extent hold a watching brief for His majesty's Government, or at least be a safeguard against things being done by the Company at Bahreij which His Majesty's Government would not approve? (d) Whether in view of the wording of the Condition, His Majesty's Govemment can demand the dismissal of Major Holmes, if he falls to carry out his obligations thereunder and if so, whether, in the event of the Company refusing to comply with such aemand, the iaheikh on the advice of His Majesty's Government would be entitled to aetermlne the concession? 8. I am to add that on the 1st August the India Office tate over from the Colonial Office the work connected with the Persian Gulf hitherto dealt with in this Department; and I dm to ask therefore that you will be good enough to send to the India Office your reply to this letter. I am, etc. (3d.) O.G.R. WILLIAMS.P.Z« 4644/33» ^'V ■Y a) i i s / ^sidence in 'Bahrein. set aunication i the Lkh. G rounds of complaint against l.a.ior liolme s^ 1. From August 1950 to August 1932 i ajor Holmes was resident in Bahrein for periods which amounted in all to about six months. Since that time he has been absent on numerous occasions on matters unconnected with, his duties as the Company 1 s Chief Local Representative in Bahrein. 2. In April 1933 Major Holmes submitted an application by the Bahrein Petroleum Company for an extension of the Company 5 s prospecting licence in return for increased payments and stated that the Ccmpany could not hold their financial offer open for more than 30 days from a certain date. After submitting his proposals Major Holmes left Bahrein for ^gypt and Jedda. The British Political Agent had thus no one in Bahrein with whcm to communicate on any points for discussion which might arise from the proposals. Such points did arise and the Sheikh of Bahrein expressed surprise at ^the absence of Major Holmes from Bahrein during a discussion of such importance'. 3. In May 1933 Major Holmes returned to Bahrein and after interviewing the Sheikh produced certain further proposals which he communicated to the British Political Agent. He then again left Bahrein. Both the circumstances surrounding the submission of the later proposals and the terms of the proposals themselves called for discussion with Major Holmes, but he was still absent from Bahrein at the end of June. Information, has, however, now been received that the Bahrein Petroleum Compa.ny have recalled him to Bahrein. 4. The personal interview with the Sheikh of Bahrein referred to in the preceding paragraph was in direct contravention of the stipulation contained in C ondition// 4 f oy Condition C that all communications with the Sheikh must be through the British Political Agent. ?ral conduct 5. Since hi© appointment under the Bahrein Bahrein and . n ^ swhere. Petroleum Company, Major Holmes general conduce botn 1 .1AV in Bahrein and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf has oeen unsatisfactory from the point of view of His Majesty^s Government. 6. With regard to Bahrein, it is clear that he has made serious mis-statements regarding his interview with the Sheikh in May (a) hy misrepresenting the Sheikh as having himself put forward proposals to Major Holmes whereas the Sheikh declares that the reverse was the case (and the complicated nature and elaborate drafting of the proposals tend strongly to bear out the Sheikh 1 s version); ('b) by misrepresenting the Sheikh as having agreed to some of his proposals and (c) by asserting that certain aspects of the matter were discussed which in fact were not mentioned at the interview. 7, He had used his frequent and prolonged absences from Bahrein to mix himself up in several matters connected with oil in the Persian Gulf outside the scope of his duties as CHef Local Representative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. The chief of these extraneous activities has been his protracted negotiations with the Sheikh of Kuwait on behalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate and the American interests behind the Syndicate for an oil concession in Kuwait, during which time he has been far from open in his dealings either with the Sheikh or with the local British authorities in the Gulf. He has also taken a hand in various efforts on the part of American interests to obtain oil concessions in other parts of the Persian Gulf area and in Hejd, In short, it is probably/probably not too much to say that the present unsatisfactory position of the various oil questions in the Persian Gulf (including Bahrein) is largely due to Major Holmes T activities in the past three years.P.Z.d6A5/'^.

Some discussion tooic place as to whether the amendments to the mining lease desired by His Majesty^s Government could be linked up with th« Company ? s ♦ application for an extension of their prospecting licenc# under Article IV' of the 19^5 Agreement, and a reference was made to the Treasury Solicitor^ Opinion regarding the Company's right under that Article to secure an extension of their prospecting licence. Some difference of opinion appeared to exist as to the interpretation to be put on the Treasury Solicitor 's Opinion, but eventually general agreement was reached on the following lin«s:- (a) The desired alterations in the mining lease csn not be made a condition of granting an extension of a/a prospecting lioenoe under Article IV of the 19^5 Agreement. (b) There is nothing to prevent the mining lease being altered by agreement with the Company. (The Company had already been warned in correspondence which took place in December 193^ that His Majesty^s Government would wish to maice certain alterations, and this position was accepted in the Company r s letter 'V U. - ; of 30th December, 195^* ^ (c) When writing to the Company about the extension of their prospecting licence, it should be possible to introduce the question of the desired alterations in the mining lease, and whil*. not making the latter dependent upon the former, to suggest that in view of the consideration extended to the Company in the past. His Majestv's Government anticipate that the Company will make no difficulties in respect of the amendment of the mining lease. The details of procedure were not, however, discussed. nrnediate 2.

The proposals would be made through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who 7/ould, in this case, be acting as agents for the Iraq Petroleum Company. Mr. Starling said he would be able to confirm this very soon. In these circumstances it was decided that the action outlined in the recent telegraphic correspondence could be initiated. This means:- (a){&amp;) A letter to the Company in London recording in categorical terms the Sheiich T s denial of the accuracy of Major Holmes's account of their interview, and explaining that it has been found necessary to approach the Company in London because of (1) Major Holmes's absence from Bahrein, (2) his breach of agreement by approaching the Sheikh direct, and (3) the inaccuracy of the account of his interview with the Sheikh- The letter would foreshadow a separate letter regarding Major Holmes's position as the Company's Chief Local Representative in Bahrein. (b) A telegram to the Persian Gulf saying that (a) above is being sent, and asking for the Sheikh's concurrence in a further communication to the Company in the terns already agreed regarding Major Holmes's proposals. (c) On receipt of the Sheikh's concurrence, the letter on this subject to issue to the Company in London» (d) The letter to the Treasury Solicitor regarding the position of His Majesty's Government under Condition 'C' scheduled to the Indenture of 1930, to issue as soon as possible- The draft of this letter had already been agreed by the Interested Departments. Company's 5. This question is to be taken up with the l Re-pre- Company in London as a separate issue when the Treasury Solicitor's reply to (d) above has been received. The question of the replacement of Major Holmes, if the latter's appointment is terminated, was discussed, and it was eventually agreed that faute de mieux the appointment of Mr. Skinner, the Company's Field/f' / / Field Works Manager in Bahrein (an American subject) would probably be the best solution. Mr. Hendel and Mr. Starling, however, wished it to be borne in mind that this would be a reversal of the policy hitherto adopted by His Majesty's Government, which had been that the Company's Chief Local Representative should be a British subject. Lieutenant-Colonel Powle said that he had re-considered his previous suggestion that the local bank manager in Bahrein should be asked to tact as the Chief Local Representative. He thought there would be administrative difficulties about this, and that the Company would be strongly opposed to the idea. WATAR. 4. The latest information is that Mr. Sampson (the representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company) has visited Q,atar, and discussed the financial aspect of the matter with the Sheikh. It is said that Mr. Sampson opened with an offer of 1 lakh of rupees, which was countered by a demand for 10 lakhs* Ho action is required at the moment, as the comments of the Petroleum Department on the draft concession are await ed- KUWAIT AKJD KUV/AIT MEUTRAL ZONE* 5. The position in regard to the Kuwait concession is that the bidding has been called off by the Sheikh. Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle said that the Sheikh knows that the free hand accorded to him to choose between the original offers is now cancelled, and that His Majesty's Government must be consulted in/ill regard to m\y fresh proposals. Mr. Starling drew attention to Colonel ?owle T s despatch of the l6th June covering a note by Colonel Dickson on the possible trend of events in Kuwait. Ke regarded this as rather disturbing and wondered whether there was any further action which might be taken in the interests of the British Company which was endeavouring to secure the Kuwait concession. Colonel Powle thought that it was not desirable to do anything further at the moment. He had seen tho Sheikh fairly recently. Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle also said that the lull was partly due to the uncertainty in the Sheikh's mind as to the neutral zone. It is not yet known whether the Hasa concession recently granted to the Standard Oil Company, includes the neutral zone. It is not unlikely that Ibn Saud added the neutral zone on the understanding that the Sheikh's consent would be obtained, and that the King has already approached the Sheikh on the subject. The probability is that things will work out as they did in 19^4&gt; i^e. that Ibn Saud will submit proposals regarding the neutral zone to the Shaikh and that the latter will refer the matter to His Majesty's Government who will be left with the odium of any refusal. There is a possibility that Ibn Saud might, by means of the neutral zone, try to influence the Sheikh's decision in regard to the Kuwait concession. Mr. Rendel expressed the view that, in this case, there would be good ground for strong representations at Jedda against interference on the part of Ibn Saud. It was suggested that the value of the Kuwait concession depended on the value of the neutral zone, and Mr. Starling undertook to ascertain from the Anglo- P'ersian/Persian Oil Compauy whether they regarded a ooncession in the neutral zone as an essential adjunct to the Kuwait concession* Mr. Rendel suggested that it might be possible to make a distinction between the neutral zone and Kuwait proper, in view of the former's history and status, and to make a declaration that on political grounds, Uis Majesty*8 Government could not allow the neutral zone to be exploited.P. 2.4649/33.

I em, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (SD.) H. R. BALLANTYNE. The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Ofiice, London, S.W.I1930/ NOT E. Mr. Ballantyne of the Bahrein Petroleum Company to-aay called (at his request) to discuss the Colonial I '■ ' Office letter of 28th July, 2&lt;. Mr, Ballantyne said that his Company had 'been considerahly disturbed 'by that letter, copies of which they had sent to their iinierican principals hy the mail oi Friday last. A copy had c^lso he en given to Lkjor Holmes before his departure for the Gulf hy the air mail of 29th July, Ihey were chiefly disturbed because they did not understand its meaning. What was its object? I said that the object of the letter was to convey the Sheikh of Bahrein's repudiations of Major Holmes's statements specified in it in regard to the offer alleged to have been made by His Excellency. Its effect was that it would be necessary for the Company to start agairie They were at present corresponding on the tasis of an offer which the sheikh repudiated. 4, Mr. Ballantyne said he understood the position. He thought it fair at the same time to say that tin the snort discussion on the telephone and personally which he had had with Ivujor Holmes before the latter's departure on Saturuay-y LB-jor Holmes had told a very different story from the Sheikh, and in particular had repudiated the suggestion that the interviews were not ea by His Excellency. He had been given an amended version of the offer to take out for submission. I 09 I said that that would, of course, have to be submioted through the Political Agent. Mr. Ballantyne a 6 reea a I saio. we attached great importance to a strict compliance with the terms of the Indenture of June 12th V ; ' / IV $ - 2 ~ 8/ 1930. I would not discuss Major Holmes's position with him now because, as he would have seen irorn the Colonial Office letter of the ^8th July, he would receive a further letter on tnat subject in due course. But it was only fair to say that took a very serious view of the actions which had led to tne Colonial Office letter being written. H.M.G also took a very serious view of his direct dealings with the Sheikh. Ballantyne said that in the first place tejor Holmes was not the Company 71 s selection. He had been forced on them oy h . m . Ct . Nor was the Company his only master. Were that the case, they could control him more closely. But he was acting also for two other different oil interests It was inevitable that the Company should give him so little latitude. Hitherto tney had heard no criticism or complaint oi him from H.M.G. It was surely difficult to contend that given the very limited society of Bahrein the oheikh and Mxjor Holmes should never discuss oil matters. Did we contend tnat there should be no oral communication on these matters? I understood him to say further that he b Cv ^ 1 ® u ^ L ' lcl u ^ * Belgrave, tne Sheikh * s Fin an cial Adviser, nad in any event seen Hie offer under discussion before it was formally submitted. 1 saiu that H»M»G. had been much shaken by the incidents now under discussion ana that he would, I thought, iind that they would be disposed to interpret the Indenture of June IdoO very strictly. That Indenture specified that all communications to the sheikh were to be addressed by the Chief Local Representative through the Political Agent sua not through either Mr. Belgrave or by means of oral discussions with the sheikh on oil questions, which there should be no difficulty in avoiding.8. Mr. Ballantyne said that if it came to a legal interpretation of the indenture of June 1950 he might have something to say, but that he agreed that it was unnece s sarjy to pursue the question of IvBJor Holmes or of the Indenture for the moment, pending receipt of the further promised letter as regards the Chief Local Hepresentative• 9. I said in conclusion that we had no desire to put any ohstacles in the way of the Company and were anxious to v/ork with them on the same friendly terms as, I understood, the Colonial Office had in the past. 31st July 1933. J • G. LAlThViAl'lE •V I EDI A OFFICE, WHITEHAIL, S.W.I. Z.4660/53. 2nd August 1933. .a U Dear Starling, As you will have seen from the Political Resident's telegram No.619 of 31st July, the Sheikh is pressing for advice fron His Majesty's Government as to whether the Bahrain Petroleum Company are entitled as of right to a further extension of their prospecting license under Article 4 of the existing concession. The position appears to be that the Treasury Solicitor gave certain r - . C/w 3 advice on this point in his letter dated 18th May, copies of which were sent by the Colonial Office to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf with their / ' p i i % confidential despatch of 25th May. In the light of Sir Maurice Gwyer's opinion, the Ccrapany were asked on 25th May to furnish certain further information to facilitate consideration of their application. This information was duly furnished on 4th July and was sent to you for comments by the Colonial Office. I write now to say that we shall be very grateful if you can help us to clear this point out of the way by letting us have an early report on the information required by the Company, in the light of which we can discuss inter-departmentally if necessary, the answer to be sent to the Sheikh. o •C. Starling, Esq. Territorial/Territorial Waters. As agreed inter-departmentally we made no reference yesterday in our letter to the Company dated 1st August No.P.Z. 4649/33 to territorial waters, in view of the uncertainty as to the intentions of the Political Resident and the Sheikh in this matter. The Company will, however, almost certainly raise the point, and it would be well to 'be prepared with a reply. So far as we are concerned here our reply can he that we have communicated the Sheikh's offer as we received it and we must refer the point to him. But we ought, 1 think, to be prepared simultaneously to advise him as to the line to be taken in regard to it. I have gone carefully through the concession of 1925 and the schedules appended to it. There appears nowhere to be any specific reference to territorial waters. Further, on a reasonable construction of the document as a whole it would, I think, be fair to say that it has land and not marine territories in view. On the other hand something must, as you suggested this morning, turn on general practice in the construction of oil agreements, and I gather from what you said that general practice would be constillied'tregarding an agreement such as the present as prohibiting drilling operations even below low water mark. If, in the light of your views and as a result of further consideration we c one to the conclusion that the existing concession can reasonably be construed as extending to the territorial waters of the SheiWi's territories, the limits of any fresh concession to be granted in respect of the area still unallotted once the Company have taken up the area of/of 100,000 acres under Article 5 of the Concession of 1925, might be identical. We shall be grateful for your views on both the points above as early as possible. I am sending copies of this letter to Warner and ■r/r Yours air.oor- Moore. j. G.

Dear Mr. Laithwaite, As I told you yesterday afternoon when we talked about the official letter received by me from His Majesty's Colonial Office . dated the 28th July, 1933, 1 had then already sent a cox^y of such letter by the fastest route to the Company in San Francisco for their consideration and reply. I ara proposing to follow up with a cable to the Company giving the purport of the Colonial Office letter, as I understand it from you, as this;- That His ..ajesty's G-overnment wish to make it quite clear to the Company that the letter of 'h' li ^ * 7 oK Cl M1 the 17th May, 1933, written by .. ajor Frank Holmes to the Political Agent, Bahrein, is not to be regarded as importing an offer made by His Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrein to this Company, and further, that such letter deals with proposals which have been definitely repudiated by His Excellency, ^vith the result that the position is now an open one and the Company must start its xiegotiations afresh. I am adding that I have assured you that the Company never contemplated being in a position to accept the proposals in the letter of the 17th May, 1933 as an offer and thereby create a binding contract, and that a further proposal from the Company was already, i.e. prior to the 28th July, 1933, in the care of Major Holmes for submission to His Excellency through the proper channel. It is understood that the Company will shortly receive a further letter from His Majesty's Government concerning Major Holmes. This, when it is received, together with the accusations ^/| ^ ry J levelled against Major Holmes in the said letter of the 28th July 1933, will receive the serious consideration of the Company. Yours sincerely, Sd/- H.R.Ballantyne. J.CKLaithwaite, Esq., India Office.P # Z.4693/33. ENCLOSURE IN ADMIRALTY COVERING LETTER NoJi.01830/33 DATED 1st AUGUST 1933. I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to refer to Mr. Blaster's letter of the 26th June, 1933, No.18155/33 to the Director of Plans concerning the Bahrein Oil concession. 2. My Lords observe that clauses, giving the following guarantees, already appear in the concession, which, so far, has consisted only of a prospecting licence. 1. The Assignee Company is to be reigstered in Great Britain or Canada. 2. The Company's office in Great Britain is to be in charge of a British subject. 3. One Director of the Assignee Company is to be persona grata to H.M, Government. 4. The local representative is to be approved by H.M.Government. 5. As many employees of the Assignee Company as possible are to be British, of subjects of the Sheik of Bahrein, It will be necessary to ensure that these clauses apply equally to the Mining Lease. 3. My Lords would suggest, sui^ject to the concurrence of the Petroleum Department, that in drafting the clauses to be submitted to the Company to cover the safeguards to be inserted for the benefit of H.M.Government in time of war or emergency, the articles which appear in the Model Mining Lease adopted for the Crown Colonies, amended as necessary to meet the special circumstances in Bahrein, M. 01830/33 ADMIRALTY, S.W.I 1st August, 1933. Sir, Under Secretary of State. Colorial Office, S.W.I should/should be taken as a basis for discussion. A copy of Articles No.5, 14, 15, 16, 1? and 18, amended as necessary, is attached, and also a copy of the Admiralty specification for oil fuel, referred to in those Articles. 4. My Lords have assumed that the Sheik will, in all cases, act on behalf of H.M.Government, and that E.M. Government will not themselves come into the contract, except that it is thought desirable to make the Articles come into operation in the event of a state of emergency or war in which either Bahrein or Great Britain is concerned. 5. As Bahrein is an independent Arab Sta.te under the protection of H.M.Government, but not a British Protectorate, it appears that in time of war or emergency the Sheik cannot be forced to exercise his rigiits under the proposedjpre-emption clause. If this clause is accepted by the Company it will presumably be necessary for H.M. Government to conclude an agreement with the Sheikh whereby the latter would agree, if required by H.M. Government, to exercise his powers under this clause in times of emergency or war. 6. Copies of this letter have been sent to the Foreign Office, India Office and Petroleum Department. I am.

It is hoped that the information to be gleaned in drilling Ho:3 well would provide a clearer indication as to bearing the position and extent of the oil bocdjag structure. This expectation was realized in part but it also provided the Company with fresh problems that cannot be solved without much additional prospecting work for which considerable time is necessary, I am therefore instructed by the Company to request that the application for an extension of the Prospect- ■■p* - ■ ii y ' f ' ing License to December 2nd 1934 - made in my letter dated April 4th,1933 - be given early consideration. The Company considers in all the circumstances that the extension is necessary and fully justified and should be granted as a matter of course under the terms of the Concession Agreement. The justification that the grant be made is witnessed by the work done by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited - since it acquired the rights granted by the Concession Agreement of December 2nd 1925 - and fully detailed and depicted in descriptive letter,schedules and maps supplied by the Companyto His Majesty's Government at its request.

I have been informed by cable from London (9-8-1933) that the India Office has been informed that the Company do not wish - at present - to make a proposal regarding the additional area and that the Company desire that the Prospecting License be extended until December 2nd,1934.€.

The meeting first considered the position of Major Holmes and the terms Ox tiie cormiunlcatlon to be made to the oompany in continuj-tion of India Office letter of 1st .august. No.p.z. 4649/33. In tne light 01 the opinion expressed by the Treasury Solicitor in his letter to tne Inula Office of 4th ^ugust and of the fact that the Political Agent, Bahrein was understood to spend as a rule 9 months in Bahrein, and the Financial naviser to the Sheikh, also a European, a longer period annually, it was agreed that H.M.G. could reasonably require the Company to maintain their Chief Local Representative in Bahrein for a period of not less than 9 months in any calendar year, u, as was thought possible, iajor nolmes's healtn was such that it would not be possible for him to comply with this requirement, the difficulties wilch have arisen in connection with hisactivities might be solved, since the Gompany might i ind. it necessary to ask us to agree to a substitute. 3. The meeting then discussed the line ou oe taken with the Gompany on the question 01 the recent activities of the Chief Local Hepresentative. It was agreed, in the light of the opinions expressed hy the Treasury Solicitor and oy the Legal Adviser at the India Ci±ice, that there was nothing in amui^ion c scheduled to the Indenture l^th June 1930 which would entitle to demand Ivajor Holmes^ q ismissal, he oeing exclusively a servant of the Gompany; and that since | • ■' • Iia u approved the appointment of kk jor Holmes they had no further say under Condition G, except that their consent would he necessary under the terms of that Condition before the oompany coula determine his appointment. The meeting also considered the possibility of advising trie Sheikh of bahiein to exclude i.ajor Holmes from iiis territories, jn view of his mioiepresentations of H.^.'s attitude, out aecided that the political and other od jections to this course were so strong oiiat it should not be considered save in the last resort. 4. xxi ter exhaustive discussion the conclusion was reached that the best course would be, without requiring: Major Hdmes 1 s/&lt;Ka/^ &gt;JJUA Holmes's dismissal, to indicate to the Company the circumstances in which he had been appointed; the fact that trie oasis of discussion had at the time 'been that the Chief Local Representative should he peraona grata to H.L .Q-, as well as to the Company, in the interests of hoth parties to add that the latest developments made it iiupoboiole J-Or any longer to iegard him as a satisfactory cnannel of communication or a satisfactory incumbent oi tne post; ana to suggest that the only satisfactory solution in their view in the interests hoth of the Company and of H.iu.G. would oe that he should now he replaced• In the event of the Company responding, xi#.iL # ur. on tneir part would he prepared to release the Company i rom their obligation to retain i.ajor Holmes unu.er tne terms of ^ondiuion c♦ o- ** (r- Irrv o. It was further agreed that if and wiien approval was obtained to action on these lines it would be well that the xHdia olilce siiould see iv.r, 3c.llantyne mioTLiiullyfalia, indicate to hiiii trie course of action which had in mind, emphasising that this was not an indication of hostility towards the Company, but that tne course proposed was one which appeared to oe in the best interests of both parties and,(if the conversation justified this) that H.JL.G-, would, not be found difiiculu in regard to the replacement of ^ajor Ho toes and might be prepared to consider as a special case It/9/ &lt;5'^ ta^ r l,v ,&lt; w ' &lt;r / 2,12»35, coupled with an extension wh i ch of the area over/the Gompany could, operate. Their intention, in other words, appeared to he to deal separately with the extension of the prospecting licence ana the extension of area, which haa become involved with another as the result of the alternative proposal of /ipril 1933. 8. The meeting in the first place considered mother the Company could demand as of right a further extension of trie prospecting licence. It was agreed, in trie light of 3ir tour Ice 10 4 ' ' ^ : . . I i : r ( Cf l O - oyer's o pJiuo n of 18th i^y, that the v&gt;ux ..as in tiio negative, and that tne decision must rest with the Sheikh on an examination oi the merits of the case, ine Petroleum ^ept. expressed thb view that the Company had no^ done enough v.ork to justify the iheikh in refusing any further extension and in claiming tnat they must select ai aggregate ai*ea oi 100,000 acres under tuxei.i mining lease on the expiry of tiie -xloting extension of the prospecting licence. In iwr. starling's vievi/ the Company might threaten in reply to abandon tne concession, hut he thought it unlikely that they would do so, and tnat any such threat would in any event 06 tlufr - The Company clearly attached gr«at importance to the possibilities of Bahrein.9. Further Investigation showed that the refusal of an extension of the prospecting licence would apparently oe dcllnl^ely in the Ihelkh's interest. In the first place, the A.P.O.C. had now In^lcatea 'tiict't 'tlisy would. 'bG unable to n^ke a firm offer for the teaia bcilance of the islands until the pioCisc area involved, was knovvn. This inioriLution woula not be available 1 ' a 1 u ^ ■ 1 ^ i ' ; e ^roleuiii Gomp any hud tak en lip —.i: mining lease. Secondly, a lurther extension might enable the Company to secure inforruation of such a nature thai, they would have no longer j-iitcrest in a cquiring a lease for tixe ualance oi the islands, while the ^• -&gt;• mi^ht decide, in view of the delay # involved, to drop out altogether. Tn ± ra 1 y, r e f u sal of an ex ten s ion woula iifeKe it possiole lor the iheikh to indicate his readiness to entertain lofiers In respect of the balance of the i^laiias, prooably towards the end of ^ on is year, once tne Company had (if they aid) taken out a mining lease and selected their areas. With a definite area in issue better offers might conceivably be expected from the competing interests. Fourthly, the effect of refusal woula be to secure at an earlier date than otherwise probable increased royalties for the 3heikh/Sheikh under the n.lnin 0 lease if the Petroleum company proceeded to take one out. On tiie other hand, the difficulty in securing modifications of the mining lease riii^ht oe greater if we reiused to meet the Company over the extension of the prospecting licence, -uid Lorce 01 tnis argument was admitted On aie o olier hand, Sir maurice Gvvyer's made it clear that we could not demand such modifications except ex gratia, and coula not make them a condition of an extension of the prospecting licence, //e should in any event oe dependent lor them on the goodwill of the Company.. It was agreed that, unsatisfactory as the po sit i on wa s, H.L.G. woula no the justified in a avisin 0 the sheikh to extend tne prospecting licence merely on the chance tact as a result tne Company might he better disposed towards granting certain concessions in the mining lease (see in this connection para^(i2 he low). It was agreed tnat the Political .Resident shoula immediately he consulted on the position generally in the telegram o^ which a draft is attached hereto. ro sit i on of territorial waterjs linge r trie 192b Concession , Reference was made to the corresponaence which had passea oetween the India Office and the PetroleuQi/Petroleum Departiuent (Mr. taiihwaite n i to Mr. otarling, dated ^nd ^u^ist, paras. 4 and 5, and 9tfi August). The Legal adviser at trie India Office, to whom the question had heen referred, had expressed the opinion that, although the matter might not 'be free from aouht, he would himself hold that 'the whole of the territories under his control' (Article 1 of Concession of 1925) and 'all parts of the territoiy under the control of the Sheikh' (First Schedule Clause 1) were comprehensive enough to include territory lying helow the Sheikh's territorial waters. On the other hand the meeting, while admitting that this was the case, was disposed to think that in the light of the correspondence which had passed in regard to an extension of the concession^, the American interests were hy no rneai s sure of their position as regards territorial waters under the 1925 Concession.

Some discussion took place as to whether the amendments to the mining lease desired by His Majesty^ Government could be linked up with the Company r s application for an extension of their prospecting licence under Article I¥ of the 1925 Agreement, and a reference was made to the Treasury Solicitor's Opinion regarding the Company 's right under that Article to secure an extension of their prospecting licence. Some difference of opinion appeared uo exist as to the interpretation to be put on the Treasury Solicitor's Opinion, but eventually general agreement was reached on the following lines:- (ct) ihe desired alterations in the mining lease made a condi tipn of granting an extension of a/ ,112. a prospecting licence under Article IV of the 1925 Agreement. ' v ^ v q (b ) rhere is nothing to prevent the mining lease being altered by. agreement with the Compaq. (The Company had already been warned in correspondence which took place in uece.uer 1932 ohat nis Majesty ^s Government would wish to ^ make certain alterations, and this position was accepted in t ' he Com P a ^' ,s letter of 30th December, 1932.) (c) when writing to the Company about the extension of their prospecting licence, it should be possible to introduce the question ox the ae sired alterations in the mining lease, and while not making the latter dependent upon the former, to suggest that in view of the consideration extended to the Company in the past, His Majesty's Government anticipate that the Company will make no difficulties in respect of the amendment of the mining lease. The details of procedure were not, however, discussed. 2. Mr.Starling said that he had heard that the Iraq i t Pet roleum Company intended to submit definite proposals Lmiz regarding the remaining area in Bahrein. The proposals would be made through the Anglo-Persian Oil Comparer,who would, in this case, be acting as agents for the Iraq Petroleum Company. Mr.Starling said he would be able to confirm this very soon. There was, he understood, a possibility that the Iraq Petroleum Company might allow two of their groups, one of whom would be the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, to negotiate for this concession, but if so they might reserve their right to take it over at a later stage. In these circumstances it was decided that the action outlined in the recent telegraphic correspondence could be initiated. This means (a)/(e) A letter to 'the Gonip3..ny in London recording in categorical terms the Sheikh's denial of the accuracy of j \s i Major jIo Imes's account of their interview, and explaining ^ that it has been found' necessary to approach the Company in London because of (1) major Holmes's absence from Bahrein, (2) nis breach of agreement by approaching the Sheikh direct, and | ^ 'kk 0 accuracy of the account of his interview with the i Sheikn, The letter would foreshadow a separate letter j| regarding Major Holmes's position as the Company's Chief Local Representative in Bahrein. (b) A telegram to tne Persian Gulf saying that (a) above ..emg oent, and asking for the Sheikh's concurrence in a tun,her communication to the Company in the terms already agreed regarding Major Holmes's proposals. (c) On receipt of the Sheikh's concurrence, the letter on uhis subject to issue to the Company in London. (d) The letter to the Treasury Solicitor regarding the position of His Majesty's Government under Condition ,f C M scneduled to the Indenture of 1930, to issue as soon as possible. The draft of this letter had already been agreed by the Interested Departments. Siliiir 3 * This question is to b8 taken «p with the co^&amp; w in London as a separate issue when the Treasury Solicitor's reply to (d) above has been received. \) question of the replacement of Major Holmes, if the latter's appointment is terminated, was discussed, and it was eventually agreed that faute de mieux the appointment of ^.Dkinner, the Company's Field Works Manager in Bahrein (an kmrican subject) would probably be the best solution, bk, iiendel and Mr. Star ling, however, wished it to be oorne in mind that this would be a reversal of the policy hitherto aaopteo. by Lis Majesty's Government, which had been that/4 4 that tne Company r s Chief Local Representative should be a British subject. Lieutenant-Colonel Fo^rle said that he had re-considered his previous suggestion that the local bank manager in Bahrein should be a^sked to act as the Chief Local nepresentative. He thought there would be administrative difficulties about this, and that the Company would oe strongly opposed to the idea, QATAR . 4. The latest information is that Mr.Sampson (the representative of the Anglo -Persian Oil Company) has visited Qa^ar, and discussed the financial aspect of the matter with tne SneiKh. It is said that Mr.Sampson opened with an offer of 1 lakh 01 rupees, which was countered by a demand for 10 lakhs. No action is required at the moment, as the consents of the Petroleum Department on the draft concession are awaited. KUWAIT -A'-in KTTi ailT HStCTAT. 'n'm 5. The position in regard to the Kuwait concession is that the bidding has been called off by the Sheikh. Lieutenant Colonel Fowle said that the situation had cnangea since the Sheikh had been given a free hand by His majesty's Government to choose between two original draft concessions. Those draft concessions, on which Eis J&amp;jesty's Government had given their technical advice, had now been supersedeu, and the Sheikh realised that His Majesty's Government, must be consulted in regard to any fresh proposals, and thao until tmxr views had been received he could not grant the concession to either side. Ir Starling drew attention to ^l^nel ; Fowle ' s despatch of the 16th June covering a no4 by Colonel Dickson on the possible trend of ;e nt3 m Kuwait. He regarded this as rather disturbing and wondered/5. wondered whether there was any further action which might be taken in the interests of the British Company which was endeavouring to secure the Kuwait concession. Colonel Powie thought that iu was not desirable 'Do do anything further at the moment. He had seen the Sheikh fairly recently. Lieutenant Colonel Fowle also said that the lull was partly due to fciie uncertainty in the Sheikh's mind as to the neutral zone, it is not yet known whether the Hasa concession recently gianted to the Standard Oil Connoany, includes tne neutral zone, it is not unlikely that Ibn Saud added the neutral zone on the understanding that the Sheikh^ consent would be obtained, and that the King has already approacried uhe Sheikh on the subject. The probability is that things will «oik ouo as tney did in 1924, i,e # that Ibn Saud will submit proposals regarding the neutral zone to the Sheikh and that the latter will refer the matter to His Majesty's Government who will be left with the odium of any refusal, ihere is a possibility that Ibn Saud might, by means of the neutral zone, try to influence the Sheikh's decision in regard to the Kuwait concession, Mr. Rendel expressed the view that if Ibn Saud tried to bring political pressure to bear on the Sheikh of Koweit in order to force him to agree to the grant of a concession in the neutral zone to Ibn Baud's nominees, there would be good ground for strong representations at Jedda. It was suggested that the value of the Kuwait concession depanaed on the value of the neutral zone, and Mr. Starling undertook to ascertain from the Anglo -Persian Oil Company whether they regarded a concession in the neutral sone as an essential adjunct to the Kuwait concession. Mr .Sendel suggested that it might be possible to make a distinction between the neutral zone and Kuwait proper.6. The neutral zone had been created for political purposes to constitute a kind of buffer, or vacuum, between Nejd and Koweit. If we were to agree to this zone being exploited by foreign coramercial enterprises, imch of the object of creating the zone would be defeated. Might it not therefore be possible for H,M.Government to make a declaration that, on political grounds, they could not agree to any concessions being granted in the neutral zone? This declaration could be made to the Sheikh of Koweit who would pass it on to any of the commercial interests concerned. There was, however, one difficulty in connection with this suggestion. It was still possible that the Anglo- Persian Oil Company might acquire the Koweit concession and wish to exploit the neutral zone themselves, and it seemed undesirable to make any premature declaration regarding the neutral zone, the effect of which might merely be to prevent a British company from operating there. It was therefore suggested that the Petroleum Department should take immediate steps to ascertain whether the A.P.O.C. were in fact likely to be interested in the neutral zone. If they were not, the possibility of pursuing Mr.Rendel's suggestion could be further considered, .Laithwaite said that he saw considerable advantages in the proposed declaration which would assimilate our policy in the neutral zone to our policy on the Trucial Coast, where commercial exploitation was also excluded for political reasons of a somewhat similar character.P .z. 4745/33.

In my opinion a reasonable interpretation of Condition G. scheduled to the Indenture of 12th June, 1930, is that the Bahrein Petroleum Co. is required in the ordinary course of business to have available at Bahrein a chief local V representative who will be regularly at his post save during such periods or such seasons and times as are normally to be regarded as proper periods of absence for a European employed in that place, regard being had to local climatic and other conditions. The use of the words s, chief local representative i? suggests the possibility of a subordinate representative, who might no doubt be empowered to act as deputy for Major Holmes in the latter ? s absence, though the papers referred to me with the lettei ._ie 31st ultimo do not give any information on this point. But however this may be, it is not a sufficient answer for the Company to say that they are satisfied that their own interests have not suffered by the absences of Major Holmes, since the other party to the Indenture of the12th June, 1930, is entitlea to complain if the Gompany have not observed Condition 0. 5 and that Gondition implies that Major Holmes will be available when the Sheikh or any local authority wishes to discuss with him as the Gompany ? s chief local representative any matters touching or arising out of the Goncession. The constant presence of a representative with full powers is obviously desirable to ensure that all questions arising between the Company and the local authorities may be promptly dealt with, and in my opinion this is what Condition C. was intended to secure. As regards the interests of His Majesty ? b Government, they appear to be safeguarded by the provision that all communications which the chief local representative of the Company may desire to address to the Sheikh shall be made through the British Political Agent in Bahrein. The additional provision that the chief local representative is to be a person whose appointment requires the approval of His Majesty f s Government was no doubt designed to secure that he should be a person who might reasonably be expected, consistently with his duty to his own employers, not to act or advise the Company to act in a manner which might be detrimental to the interests of Hls Majesty (xovernment; but there is in my opinion no implied term in the Agreement that Major Holmes: is to be regarded, in the words of the &gt; [&lt;3 letter of the 31'st ultimo, as holding a watching brief for His MajestyGovernment, the latter, as I read Condition G being content to rely upon their personal knowledge of the character of the person whose appointment they approved. The chief local representative is exclusively a servant of the Gompany and there is nothing in Condition G. which would entitle His Majesty f s Government to demand his1,01 ao 1 V;unic that the Jlicikh will be entitled to determine the Agreement on the ground only that the Company had refused to dismiss Major Holmes; but if the Company persists in neglecting to maintain the chief local ^ representative at Bahrein,whether Major Holmes or some other representative whose appointment has oeen approved ; b7 Ki - Government, then I think that the Sheikh | would have the right to ao so. I observe however that under the Agreement the question whether the cancellation of the Concession is justified on the ground that the Company have failed to conform to the terms of the Agreement is one which in the last resort falls to be determined by arbitration.and the question whether the Company's action or rather inaction in the matter of Major Holmes' frequent absences, apparently with the Company's consent, from his post at Bahrein can reasonably be regarded as a breach of their obligations under Condition C. is one of fact and of degree, on which different persons might no doubt arrive at different conclusions. In my opinion there is certainly evidence on which an impartial Arbitrator could properly find tnat a breach of condition C, has occurred; but I cannot affirm mat an Arbitrator would necessarily take the same view.

Dear Starling, x I I enclose copy of a telegram from the Political Resident about Bahrein oil, which is self-explanatory. It is, I think, very satisfactory that the Sheikh should he prepared to agree to a strict interpretation of Condition C of / the Schedule to the Indenture of 12th June 1930, and this oaght considerably to strengthen our hands in dealing with HolneE As regards Colonel Loch , s second suggestion, we agree entirely as to the advisability of all negotiations on the part of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, whether written or oral, b eing conducted solely through the Political Agent, As the Resident points out, it is important to avoid any suggestion that we are discriminating against the Bahrein Petroleum Company, and apart from this, it is, I think, on general grounds desirable to concentrate discussions on oil questions in a single channel. If, as we hope, you agree, perhaps you will take the matter up with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company? 3# In this connection, perhaps you could let me know the present positicnin regard to the Anglo-Persian Oi^ Company^ proposal in respect of Bahrein oil? 4» I am sending copies of this letter to Warner, and to King at the Admiralty.

Dear Starling, J Will you kindly refer to paragraphs 4 and 5 of my letter of 2nd August, No.P.Z,4660/33, which dealt with the question of territorial waters in connection with Bahrein oil? 2. Since the date of that letter wfe have, as you will have seen from Bushire telegram of 3rd August No.632, heard from the Resident that, subject to safeguards for harbours and ports, the Sheikh agrees to the inclusion of the territorial waters in the fresh concession for which the Bahrein Petroleum Company have been given an opportunity to apply, to cover the area which will remain unallotted after a mining lease has been taken out by them under their concession of 2nd December, 1925. We are thus in a position to reply affirmatively to the Company if they raise the question whether territorial waters are included in the area for which they are invited to apply. 3. I confess at the same time that I still feel some slight hesitation as to the position of territorial .Starling, Esq., waters Petroleum Department, Board of Trade, S .W .lwaters under the existing agreement of 1925, and it is taportant to know where we stand about this in considering any application for a concession in respect of the balance of the c '3heil^hs terrii*frriDo -u-iib -oerrxtones. i an now inclined to think that on a reasonable construction of the agreement territorial waters regarded as covered by the words '^p-jt.a&gt;&gt;-i^ J' ^ irih:rDli: '' ln ^ • On the other hand the i.ordin b ox soke 01 tne subsequent communications is rather puzzling and rather tends to suggest that the Anerican interests and the Bahrein Petroleum Company do not regard their position under the original agreement in respect of territorial waters as secure. I enclose , in the first place a copy of Holmes's letter of 23rd ^[iip-APril, 192b to the Political Agent at Bahrein, in which a PPlled for an extension of the area of the concession. u/Un which great emphasis is, as you will see, laid upon territorial waters, though adnittedly paragraph 2 is so worded as to suggest that the company regard territorial waters as being included in the original agreement. 4. Secondly the exploration licence appended to the draxt agreement enclosed in Holmes's letter of 5th May, 192d to the Political Agent is to run for a period not exceeding two years 'from the date of this Agreement, wherebywhereby the Company shall he entitled throughout the v^nole pf ^e^eQ^tories, In cludlne; territorial watRT-R , under his conurol, but excluding t he area of inn.nm ^ cr6S - ^ one hundred thousand acres) which the Eastern end General oyndicate acoui red under its AtO'B fitnftnt. of December 2nd, 1925 ' The mining lease is equally in respect of 'the rmaining portion of the whole of the territory under the control of the Sheikh, including its territorial waters (but excluding the 100,000 acres mentioned in Article l) The area applied lor equals about 97,920 stcrss.' letter rrom the East ern Gulf Oil Company me ^13188-1910' dated24th October, 1929. to the Eastern and General Syndicate, of which copies were circulated under Colonial Office letter of 21st November, 1929. No.69035/29. in its penultimate paragraph reads as follows:- 'f- **/. l/H€/if / In as much as this additional concBssion would embrace an area or land slightly in excess of one half of the original concession of December 2nd, 1925, and inaanuch as the additional concession would be in large part over water, we feel that in agreeing to making' the rentals and royalties the same as under the DecQuber 2ndG^) 2ncl, 1925 concession a liberal offer has been made to the Sheikh'. 6, Admittedly none of the documents quoted above is Inconsistent with the view that territorial waters are covered by the 1925 agreement. No doubt my hesitations are groundless and merely due to my unfamiliarity with the course of the correspondence and discussion which has taken place on this subject. But in view of the teportance of the point it seems well to examine it, and perhaps you would consider it in connection with hnt paragraphs 4 and 5 of my letter of 2nd August? 7. we have been considering whether there is any risk, in view of the deference to the Sheikh's 'territories' in the Agreement of December, 1925, of a claim being put forward by the syndicate to rights in respect of Hawar and the area in Qatar to which a vague claim is maintained by Bahrein and to which Colonel Loch refers in his p- .ro m telegram of 23rd July •&amp;Z1 to the Colonial Office. The exploration licence granted under the Agreement of 2nd December 1925 (from the area specified in which the areas underunder 'th© prospsct/ing licsnss and mining l68,tS6 must/ 'bo selected) is, however, in respect 01' ''the wnole of the territories under' the Sheikh's 'co ntro l'.

His Excellency admits that the Company has not failed in carrying out drilling oerations continuously over a period far excee ing the three months mentioned in Article IY of the Bahrain Oil ♦ Concession. Owing to the financial position of the State however His iiXcellency is averse from granting to the Company an extension of the Prospecting License until December 2, 1934 because he considers that such anan extension would tend to postpone the time when the Government of Bahrein will benefit financi&amp;lly from the oil concession. He does not agree with the view hel ' by the Company that it has a n right ?T to this extension but he will be guided on this point by the interpretation of the clause in question by the legal experts in England to whom the matter hes been referred. 3. He regrets that the nrevious offers for the additional ares are now definitely withdrawn. 4. His Excellency has -particularly instructed me to inform you that until quite recently he has suffered from a grave ais-apprehension regarding the additional area. Although the concession is for 100,000 acres, which corresponds to 100,000® feddans, His Excellency has always assumed that the concession covered half of the total area of Bahrain, apart from the fore shore and territorial waters. His Excellency is of the opinion thet His Britannic Majesty's Political Agents were also under this impression as when refer ring to the additional area the expression 'other half' has been in general use. Neither acres or ferldans ere familiar to His Excellency as a lend measure and he has always assumed that the area described in the concession as 100,000 acres represented only half the island. further His Excellency believes that in the first agreement between His Excellency Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali alKhalifah, and the Eastern and General Syndicate, which was not approved, the concession was for half of Bahrain. No copy of this first agreement appears to be in existence.

Therefore this request is for permission to negotiate for the balance of the total area including territorial waters which is 153square miles equalling 97,920 square miles. The terms upon which this area is requested are exactly the same as those laid down in the Bahrain Oil Concession Agreement of December 2nd 1925. Further permission is also requested that the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited be allowed to negotiate with H.E Shaikn Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah for permission to develop the deep waters of Khor Kaliya lying to the south of Muharraq and east of Halat al Nannas and Has al Jasra (Essex Point) and the sea and land approached thereto as a safe harbour for the ships engaged for transporting the oil and its products won from the Bahrain Islands, sole right to the use of the harbour of Khor Ka li7a are not asked but preferential rights, use and&gt; i / x ***** 9 facilities for developing these waters and approaches thereto and preferential rights to the use of the developed harbour and full control over all piers,causeways,docks etc. .erected by the Concession holders to develop and make the harbour safe for ships to enter,load and depart therefrom. If permission is granted to negotiate (the writer who holds a full Power of Attorney from the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited) will be pleased to submit a draft Concession Agreement for your approval, to early reply to this application is respectfully requested.Copy 0! letter No;C /34 dated the 14th Muharrem 1347 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to the Political Agent, Balirai n, Reference correspondence ending with your NoiCy/l^^S of 1928. The terms under which the G vernment is prepared to grant a further concession are those laid down in the draft con cession forwarded to you under my C/53 dated 24th Dhul Haj 1346 9 I nave no urtiier remarks to xaaise except that I would press tne reasonableness of the i^astern General Syndicate paying the extra amount asked for. They have,I submit, on their first concession had an opportunity of investigating as to tie advisability or otherwise of proceeding with their enterprise,and now as the result of the investigation they consider it is worth their while to take over the other half of the Shaikh 9 s territory and his territorial waters and consequently they should pay for the privilege, I contend that this Government has a strong claim in this conne/ection as the Eastern General Syndicate only applied for the new concession - having apparently made sure it was worth their while.ii/^ b f j-r ^8 nonfldenti al .

I myself, In conversation with His Excellency, have, so far as I can recollect, invariably used in this connection the words (in Arabic) ^the remainder*. I am not sure that I have not heard His Excellency use the term ^the half* to describe the remaining area, but, If he did so, I certainly never regarded It as being anything other than a loose numerical expression of his own. ^t Is difficult to explain to His Excellency any comnlicated matter, such as measurements, which lies beyond his ken, and at present he is upset at the fading away of his/ esty 's Secretary of State for India, The India Office, I«ondon.3 his hopes of iEwne^late supplies of money- It seems probable that some genuine misunderstanding has taken place, hut I hope that it vill he possible to remove any grievance that he may at present feel, I am sending a copy of this letter to the Government of India.

He said that,as far as they knew,he served them well and that they appreciated that he was actuated by self glorification. I told Mr.Chisholm that I had known Yusuf Kanoo for a great \ j many years and that his history was like a fever chart: that he was a born intriguer and had an insatiable desire lor power and that his life had been spent in climbing on one 'Cause' or another until he had reached an height which necessitated his being put in his place; that it was, In lact.a case of 'a servant when he reigneth'. I said that this information was purely for his personal ear and for Mr.JSlkington,if he liked to tell him. 2.

Sould it not be Possible when these points are being discussed with Pallantyne to take the opportunity of raising ' olmes' position on the ground that the existing agreement is not being complied with. Judging by past correspondence it appears that the Company do not altogether approve of him, and if we give them a hint that H. .Government were not satisfied with his recent activities they might be prepared to terminate his services. Palling that, we might take the line that we propose to insist on the agreement being observed which would involve his .Blaxter Esq., Colonial Office, Downing St,, remaining/ |remaining in Pahrein for the full period of residence as prescribed in the agreement. As the Company's operations increase there should he more for him to do there than has been the case in the past. If as a result of such action Holmes resigned his appointment, it would be all to the good and I am inclined to think that once he gave up Bahrein his prestige would be very much lessened in other countries in the Persian Gulf and Arabia. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel, Walton and Soore.

The whole question of future payments will, however, have to he reviewed in the light of the latest proposals made 'by the Company, and it seems hest to leave this matter for discussion at a later stage. 3. Article 5. (second paragraph) . The wording of this Article is certainly not very clear. The Petroleum Department would, perhaps, suggest a revised wording which could he submitted to the Company. 4. Article 8 (second sentence to the end) . As in the case of the proposed amendment of Articles 3 and 9, these proposals also may present some difficulties, hut as it is understood that payments of this nature would he in accordance with modern practice, they might he put to the Company. I 5. As regards the additional provisions proposed, Nos.l, 2, 5, ^ 5 and 6 seem to require no oomment, and these additions might he submitted to the Company. o.

Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister will be aware that one of the conditions under which H.M. Government were prepared to advise the Sheikh of Bahrein to extend the license granted to the uastern and Lreneral Syndicate and agree to assignment to a new Company was that the Syndicate should give an assurance that they would take no steps which would prejudice the position of the proposed sites for a landing ground and seaplane station in Bahrein, vide Colonial Office letter of the 16th September, 1929, 69035/29.

The question of providing for keeping the landing ground for aeroplanes clear will be taken up when the time comes to discuss with the Bahrein Petroleum Company the terms of the mining lease which they will require before they can engage on active development of the oil resources of Bahrein, and in the meantiaie it does not appear immediately necessary to take any further steps to safeguard Muharraq Island. 3.

They explained that the islands off Qatar were the cause of this hesitancy (here the Shaikh added that the Foreign Office knew that these jsla.nds are the dependencies of Bahrain and that there is a ninety year old agreement somewhere to this effect) and,therefore, to avoid any misunderstanding 'by the omission of these islands, they would like the area to 'be called ? Bahrain Is lands * 0 7. They also agreed to the territorial waters 'being included in the area. 8. As regards the time limit suggested 'by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Shaikh suggested that six weeks might 'be allowed instead of one month, 9. The Shaikh also said that what he wanted was an increase in the cash payments and not merely bh increase in the loan.

A F T . Dawning Street. July, 1933. S TREASURY 30LICIT0R. Sir, I an directed tiy secretary Sir Philip Cunlilfe-Lister to refer to the letter from this Department the 18th of May regarding the Bahrein petroleum company* s oil concession in Bahrein, and to inform you that further questions have arisen in connection with this concession upon which he would he glad to receive your advice. 2. The points on which your advice is sought arise out of Condition C scheduled to the Indenture of the 12th of June, 1930, a copy of which accompanied the Colonial Office letter under reference. a copy of Condition c Condition c. / / is, however, enclosed with this letter forrv ^ •- / j U / / \ \ ^ for ease of reference. By this Condition, the Bahrein petroleun Company are required to maintain at all times in B ahrein sin official to be styled the Company's 'Chief Local Representative', who shall be the sole representative of the Company empowered to deal direct with the local autherities and population in Bahrein, and who shall conmunicate with the Sheikh of Bahrein only through the British Political Agent in Bahrein. The condition goes on to provide that for the first five years after the Company starts to operate in Bahrein, or for such lesser period as the company may operate in that territory, their 'Chief Local Representative' shall be Major Frank Holmes, provided that the arrangement between the company and Major Holmes continues to be mutually satisfactory and provided that the deteimination of his appointment shall be subject to\ ^ to the consent of His Majesty's Go verrment. 3. It should be explained that His Majesty's Government attached considerable Importance to the Company's Chief Local Representative being a British subject. This was considered essential not only to ensure harmonious relations between the company exploiting the concession and the Bahreini population and the local authorities, but also because the special treaty relations existing between His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh of Bahrein render it highly desirable that the company's Chief Local Representative should be a British subject and persona grata to His Majesty's Government. This was explained at the time to representatives of the American interests, to whom the concession was being assigned, and who were anxious to appointappoint a United States citizen as the chief Local Representative. A compromise was eventually reached whereby although Condition C did not state in terms that the Company's Chief Local Representative should be a British subject, Major Holmes, who is a British subject, should be appointed to the post for the first five years. 4, Unfortunately, the arranganent has not turned out satisfactorily from the point of view of His Majesty's Goveranent. Major Holmes has frequently and for long periods absented hjmself from Bahrein, and has on one occasion at least failed to comply with the provision that he should communicate with the sheikh only through the Political Agent at Bahrein. Moreover, he has taken advantage of his absences from Bahrein to engage in other activities, unconnected with his duties in^ ' 0 , in Bahrein, which have heen the cause of considerable embarrassment to His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gull' and elsewhere. A note is Note. attacned to this letter setting out in ^ more detail the grounds of complaint against Major Holmes. 5. In these circunstances, His Majesty's Government have, for some time, had under consideration the possibility of taking steps either to compel Major Holmes to confine himself to carrying out his duties in Bahrein within the teims of Condition C, or to securing his replacement by some other more satisfactory individual. To this end, it has been necessary for His Majesty 's Government to examine their precise position under condition C. The view taken is that the wording of the Condition is only open to the natural constructionconstruction that the company 1 s Chief Local Representative should spend his whole time in Bahrein (with a reasonable period of annual leave for purposes of health, which should he spent in a tetter climate than that of the Gulf). He should in any case, he at hand when business has to he transacted with the local authorities, or negotiations conducted with the Sheikh of Bahrein, whether such business or negotiations are initiated by the concessionaires or by the other party. It may also be held to be implicit in the Condition that the chief Local Representative, who is to be persona grata to His Majesty's Government, should to some extent hold a watching brief for His Majesty's Government, or at least constitute himself a safeguard against things being done by the Company at Bahrein which His Majesty's Go-vernment wouldwould not. approve. 6. In August, 1932, the question of Major Holme's absences from Bahrein was tsken up with the company, when they were asked whether they would give an assurance that Major Holmes would reside in Bahrein for a minimum period of nine months each year. After oral discussions with the company's representa tive in London, a reply was received to the effect that the Chief Local Representative had been in Bahrein at all times required by the Company for communications with the Sheikh and the local authorities, and expressing the view that, while condition C decides the medium of approach, it leaves to the Company 'as necessarily it must', the decision when and for what purposes the Company should approach the local Bahrein Petroleum / / authorities. A copy of the n Bahrein Fetroleum pany, 3rd February, / correspondence with the Company is enclosed withwith this letter. A corollary to the oompsny's interpretation of Conditiotil, which has been conflxmed in oral discussions with the Company's representative in London, is that no violation of the condition would have taken place if at any time the local authorities, or the Sheikh, desired to transact business with the Chief Local Bepresentative and the latter was absent from Bahrein.* 7. Before pursuing the matter further with the company, it is desired to clarify the legal position under Condition c, and I an accordingly to request that you will be good enough to furnish the secretary of State with your advice on the following points. (a) The correct interpretation of the phrase 'at all times maintain in Bahrein'; i.e. does this mean that the Chief L.ocal Representative should spend hishie whole time in Bahrein, with a reasonable period for leave, or that he need only be in Bahrein when required to transact business or conduct negotiations? (b) If the latter interpretation is correct, does this mean that he need only be in Bahrein to transact business or conduct negotiations when reauireri bv the Company? (c) Whether it is implicit in the wording of Condition C that the chief Local ftepresentative, who is supposed to be persona grata to His Majesty's Government, should to some extent hold a watching brief for His Majesty's uOvsriimenxp, or at least be a safeguard against things being done by the Company at Bahrein which His Majesty's Government would not approve. (d} Whether in view of the wording of the condition. His Majesty's Go vernmentGovernment can demand the dismissal of Major Holmes, if he fails to carry- out his obligations thereunder. I am, &amp;c.,/ Gro ncu- ol coaplaint against Major Holmes# lence in 1&lt;* From August 1930 to August 1932 Major Holmes was resident in Bahrein for periods which amounted in all to about six months. Since that time he has been absent on numerous occasions on matters unconnected with his duties as the Company 's Ghiel' Local Representative in Bahrein* 2» In April 1933 f4ajor Holmes submitted an application by the Bahrein Petroleum Company for an extension ol' the Company ^s prospecting licence in return for increased payments and stated that the Company could not hold their financial offer open for more than 30 days from a certain date. Alter submittin, his proposals Major Holmes left Bahrein for Egypt and Jedda. The British Political Agent had thus no one in Bahrein with whom to communicate on any points for discussion which might arise from the proposals. Such points did arise and the SheMi of Bahrein expressed surprise at 'the absence of Major Holmes from Bahrein during a discussion of such importance'• • In .ay 1933 Major Holmes returned to Bahrein and al t.er interviewing the Sheikh produced certain further proposals which he communicated to the British Political Agent. He then again left Bahrein. Both the circumstances surrounding the submission of the latter proposals and the terms of the proposals themselves called for discussion with Major Holmes, but he was still absent iroia Bahrein at the end of June. Information has, however, now been received that the Bahrein Petroleum Company have recalled him to Bahrein./, ) : {iy/ rect comfflim- ation with s Sheikh# leral iduct in ire in and -ewhere* 4. The personal interview with the Sheikh of Bahrein referred to in the preceding paragraph was in direct contravention of the stipulation contained in Condition C that all communications with the Sheikh must he through the British Political Agent. 5# Since his appctotment under the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Major Holmes' general conduct both in Bahrein and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf has 'been unsatisfactory f rom the point of view of His Majesty^ Government. 6. With regard to Bahrein, it is clear that he has made serious mis-statements regarding his interview with the Sheikh in May hy misrepresenting the Sheikh as having agreed to some of his proposals and by asserting that certain aspects of the matter were discussed which in fact were not mentioned at the interview# He had used his frequent and prolonged absences from Bahrein to mix himself up in several matters connected with oil in the Persian Gulf outside the scope of his duties as Chief Local Representative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. The chief of theae extraneous activities has beenhla protracted negotations with the Sheikh of Kuwait on behalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate and the American interests behind the Syndicate for an oil concession in Kuwait, during which time he has been far from open in his aealings either with the Sheikh or with the local British authorities in the Gulf. He has also taken a hand in various efforts on the part of American interests to obtain oil concessions in the Persian Gulf area and in Nejd. In short, it is probably not too much to say that the present unsatisfactory position of the various oil questions in the Persian Gulf (including Bahrein) is largely due to Major Holmes* activities in tlie past three years#air hail. p.z. by osa itttl. •_ i-M'-i^' Forwarded witn til compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office, for the information of the Political Resident, Bashire.

In that letter we stated that the question of our negotiating an agreement with H.E. the Shaikh of Bahrein for the exploitation for oil of any of his territories unallocated to other parties was under review by our London Principals, and that we would communicate with you again within one month. .Ve now therefore 'beg to inform you that we wish to interest ourselves in the territories described above, and we shall be obliged-if H.K. the Shaikh may be informed accordingly. We understand that the Bahrein Petroleum Company's current prospecting license, which is due to exoire on Snd December next, may be extended. If it is not extended, the Bahrein Petro leum Company must choose before 2nd December up to 100,000 acres of territory in not more than three blocks for exploitation under a mining lease, whereafter we or any other oarties can negotiate with H.S. the Shaikh for a concession over the whole or part of his remaining territory, -unless it has previously been conceded elsewhere. If, on the other hand, the Bahrein Petroleum Conroany 's current prospecting license is extended, then other parties such as ourselves cannot interest themselves in that territory until the termination of that license. We shall be glad therefore if you will inform H.S. the Shaikh of Bahrein that we wish to interest ourselves in theexploitation for oil of such Darts of his territory as are not allocated to other parties; that our proposals will naturally depend on the extent and nature of the territory which is avail' able for us; that we shall he glad to be informed as soon as such areas become available, and the precise nature and extent of such areas; and that on receiving this information we shall commence negotiations with His Excellency in due forro for a concession over those areas.

The volume is a direct continuation of ‘File 86/2 IV (C 43) Bahrain Oil; Eastern and General Syndicate Limited’ (IOR/R/15/1/652). The principal correspondents in the volume are Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, Political Agent in Bahrain, Captain Everald Gastrell, officiating Political Agent in Bahrain during Loch’s absence, and various members of the India Office, Colonial Office, and Petroleum and Mining Departments in London.Key subjects discussed in the volume include:BAPCO’s request for an extension of their prospecting license to 2 December 1934;Questions over the award of a second concession covering the remainder of the Bahrain islands not included in BAPCO’s existing concession of 100,000 as-yet unspecified acres of territory; correspondence with representatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with regard to this second concession;British officials’ attempts to oust Major Frank Holmes from his position as Chief Local Representative for BAPCO in Bahrain, because of his perceived failure to fulfil contractual requirements as set out in the original concession agreement;Recommendations with regard to Holmes’s position, provided by the British Government’s Treasury Solicitor, Sir Maurice Gwyer (folios 242-44);News of Holmes’s dismissal as BAPCO’s Chief Local Representative, dated 26 August 1933 (folio 293).Three maps are also included in the file, which were originally enclosed with a report that is mentioned in a letter contained in the volume (folio 203), although the report itself is not included.
