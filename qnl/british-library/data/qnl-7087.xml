Book Co INDIA OFFICE. B. 419. P. C)796I2$. Future Policy on the Trucial Coast. Correspondence between the Secretary of State for India, the Government of India, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (1929). Introductory Noth. 1. The developments affecting the position of His Majesty’s Government on the Trucial Coast in the period 1908-28 and the question of the general policy of Uis Majesty’s Government in that area are dealt with in the India Office Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs, reprinted on pages 87-94 of P.G. 13. The position of the Sheikhdom of El Qatr is dealt with in the Memorandum on pages 95 and 90 of that paper. 2. Subsequent to the publication of P.G. 13, the question of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Trucial Chiefs and Qatr came under the consideration of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. The Sub-Committee, after considering memoranda on the subject by the Colonial Office and the India Office (papers Nos. P.G. 22 and P.G. 26j, decided, „ at their meeting on the 19th November 1928, “to adopt the conclusions set forth in paper No. P.G. 22, para. G, namely, that ‘our present position on the Trucial Coast is sufficient to protect essential British interests; that we should endeavour to maintain the independence of the Trucial Chiefs, and should not allow our present position in regard to them to be weakened in any way ; that we should rely upon our existing treaty rights to secure this end, and that it is not desirable at present to incur the further commitments that would be involved in the conclusion of regular protectorate treaties.’ ” 3. Since the date of this conclusion, the general question of policy has, however, again been raised in the correspondence reprinted below. Sir Frederick Johnston, on assuming the charge of the Persian Gulf Pesidency at the end of 1928, remarked in the despatch printed as No. I below, that it was for consideration whether a review of the Trucial Coast policy of His Majesty’s Government with regard to actual conditions and needs was not called for. He suggested that certain tentative proposals made by him to this end might be considered, together with the position as a whole, by his successor, Colonel Barrett, “ who has a unique experience of the Arab littoral.” Colonel Barrett’s report is printed as No. HI. The views on it of the Government of India will be found in the Viceroy’s telegram of 22nd October 1929, reprinted as No. IV. India Office, J. G. L. 23rd October 1929. P. 3840/29. I. Views of Sir Frederick Johnston. No. 133 S. of 1929. From the Hon. Sir F. IF. Johnston, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. British Residency and Consulate-General, Sir, Bush ire, 23rd April 1929. I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 58 N., dated 13th June 1928,* to which you have just called attention in your letter No. F. 58 N./28,* of the 9th April 1929. 2. The suggestions for checking the series of murders in the Shaikh family of Abu Dhabi emanated from iny predecessor, who apparently found the practical imposition of any remedy to be impossible without the assumption of a very much greater amount of internal control than is consistent with His Majesty’s Government’s policy on the Trucial Coast, and, I am informed, delayed his reply in the hope that the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence would result in the policy of a greater degree of interference in the Trucial Coast internal affairs. 4006 50 10.29 * Not printed. A* P. 4575/27, not printed; but see P.G. 13, page 89, pams. 14 and 15. 9 3. History will, I think, show few societies which have not passed through the stage of the assumption of power by murder. That it is inhuman everyone will admit, but there are many things going on on the Arab coast that are much more inhuman, and the murder of a Shaikh is only a symptom of a primitive state of affairs from which development must be gradual and which cannot be altered by the mere suppression of that symptom. Though there may be possibly some sympathy for the first Shaikh, it is difficult to feel any for his successors in the blood-stained line. They know exactly the contract they are taking on. As a matter of policy the results of interference in successions are very clearly set forth in para. 3 of Despatch No. 13 of 1927, from the Government of India to' the Secretary of State for India. 0 If a policy of interference with the will of the people and of bolstering up weak Shaikhs is to be adopted, the only corollary is practical annexation. Arabia is by no means exempt from the changed conditions of thought throughout the world, and the only hope of improvement seems to lie in the development along the Arab coast of better appreciation of the sanctity of human life and the advantages of social stability. So long as these violent changes do not affect the lives and security of British subjects, I fail to see the necessity of viewing them too strictly from the point of view of an alien school of thought. 4. As regards the wider question of our general policy on the Arabian side, I feel that with the short period of my tenure here and the small opportunity I have had, owing to difficulties of transport, of studying on the spot the problems existing there, any views 1 express can only be of value as the result of the application of a perfectly fresh outlook on conditions entirely novel to an experience of administration under conditions in many ways similar, gained on the Indo-Afghan frontier. Such experience as I have obtained of our dealings with the Trucial Chiefs leads me to think that possibly both interference and non-interference are cairied in some matters to a greater degree than is consistent with our interests, and that there is a complete absence of real political touch. The political duties on the Trucial Coast are performed by the Residency Agent, himself on Arab, and as such liable to Arab intrigues and partisanship. He lives at Shargah, some 8 miles from Dabai, where the mail steamer calls once a fortnight. Telegraphic communication can only be made through Henjam by special sailing arrangements in case of great urgency. The Resident can only pay occasional visits and can only have a very partial knowledge of what is really going on. In view of the importance of this portion of the coast, with possibilities of Wahabi aggression and the prospect of opening up an air service, it seems a matter for argument whether the time has not now come to post at Dabai a full-time Political Agent and to instal there telegraphic or wireless communication. The Shaikhs are in general well disposed, and as life is mainly maritime there is always present in the Navy an efficacious and prompt weapon to deal with any recalcitrance. A capable officer provided with a small but seaworthy launch in which he could visit the outlying Shaikhdoms seems to be the only means by which we can maintain real political touch with the Trucial Coast and efficiently arrange and maintain a satisfactory air service on the Arab littoral. The case is similar as regards Qatar, and it seems to be a matter for consideration whether closer and more definite arrangements should not be made with this Shaikhdom under the political advice of the Political Agent at Bahrain. Until some change is made on the lines above 1 can see little prospect of any satisfactory or safe arrangement for aerial flight on the A rab littoral. Possibly, now that he has apparently dealt satisfactorily with his recalcitrant Najd tribes, Bin Sand may be able to take a more liberal view of flights over the Hasa coast, but in any case the distance between Kuwait and Bahrain is not great. Further down, however, there would appear to be an ever recurring risk of trouble unless the position is made more definite and consolidated. 5. Both as regards the Trucial Coast and the larger Shaikhdoms, there would appear to be a considerable element of doubt as to how far the policy which is formally and publicly enunciated is being actually carried out and whether it is not now advisable to review that policy with regard to actual conditions and needs.I extract the following Jrom an article in an American magazine : — Mascat is a British protectorate. Qatar, as well as Trucial Oman on the Persian Gulf, is a British sphere of influence. Bahrain is practically a Crown Colony, and Koweit is bound by treaty to take advice and receiv T e protection from the British Government.” There is little exaggeration here, but it differs substantially in actuality from our theoretical position. b. I cannot but think that many of the difficulties we are now encountering on the Persian side of the Gulf would have been obviated had we taken earlier stocTv of our position and regularised and consolidated it when that position enabled us to do so, and there seems a possibility that eventually, with the growing power of Bin Sand or -some other iorm of Arab nationalism, the time might come when failure to consolidate and regularise our claims in a more definite and less veiled manner might leave us to be shorn of privileges which we had long enjoyed, but which we had failed to make sufficiently regular to stand before a diplomatic court. I put forward these opinions with due deference, recognising that their only value is the relative one expressed at the beginning of para. 4 above. For that reason they may possibly merit further examination by an expert, and I can think of no one better suited to do so than the officer who is to take over charge from me, Colonel Barrett, who has a unique experience of the Arab littoral. 7.

Shaikh Shakbut has, however, in spite of onr non-intervention, already nominally governed Abu Dhabi for a longer period than Shaikh Saggar. 1 say “nominally governed,” as during my recent visit to A bn Dhabi it was obvious that the real governor is the murdering uncle, Shaikh Khalifa, who was treated with the greatest deference by all. No Arab Shaikh would be classed as a first-class life by an insurance company, so it is very unsafe to prophesy ; but so far as 1 can judge, there is no immediate prospect of another change of rulers, provided Shaikh Shakbut does nothing contrary to the wishes of his powerful uncle or the Junta, which exists in all these principalities. I doubt whether Sir Lionel Haworth's proposal, that “ in the event of a Shaikh’s being murdered, His Majesty’s Government will consult with the leading merchants and others of Abu Dhabi and then recognise a Shaikh elected by them,” is a real remedy. I am of opinion that no “ removal ” takes place until the successor has assured himself that the Junta will not be hostile to him. If 1 am right in my belief, the reference to “the leading merchants and others” would merely be an appeal from Otesar unto Caesar. •3. I have discussed the subject of fratricide with those whose opinion is of value, and 1 find that so long as it is confined to a Shaikhly family, it is looked upon as an ordinary occurrence about which no sensible person will bother his head. Of course, it is forbidden in the Quran, but that is a matter between the murderer and his conscience. One night there will be shouting in the town and some shots will be fired. The citizens will close their doors and go to sleep. The next morning it will be given out that the Shaikh is dead and has been succeeded by one of his relations. It is generally a family affair pure and simple. One of the new Shaikh’s personal retainers—usually a slave—may have been involved ; but in most cases the coup de r/race has been administered by the new Shaikh himself, as others are diffident about committing themselves to such an extent. In the case of Shaikh Saggar the actual murderers appear to have been Manasir Bedu, acting under the orders of Shaikh Saggar’s brother, Khalifa ; but otherwise it is the same story. Provided Shaikh Shakbut can keep the goodwill of his relatives by giving them sufficient maintenance allowances and preserve the suppoit of the Junta, there is no reason why he should not continue to rule Abu Dhabi. 4. The root of most of the fratricidal trouble is that although — thanks to the pearl trade—the rulers are not paupers, they are poor, and the poverty of the State renders it almost impossible for the ruler to satisfy the demands of his numerous relations. The anxiety of Shaikh Hamad (ruler of the rich State of Bahrain) to satisfy all his A1 Khalifa relatives—even those with whom he is not personally on good terms—is a manifestation of the Arab rulers’ inherent dread of his relatives and anxiety to conciliate them. I am in absolute agreement with the views laid down by Sir Frederick Johnston in para. 3 of his letter Xo. 133 S. of the 23rd April 1929.* Unless and until the Government of India are prepared to interfere much more than they have done in the past, and are prepared, if necessary, to bolster up a weak Shaikh, however much we may regret it, the only course is to continue to shake hands with successful murder. These Shaikhs are not Europeans nor products of modern civilisation, and we cannot apply our standards to them. The result of the policy of bolstering up weak Shaikhs is to be seen in Bahrain and Muscat, and if Government decide to adopt it they must do so with their eyes open to the consequences. 5. It is quite within the bounds of probability that the bigoted prejudice of the Trucial Chiefs may force us to some policy of active interference in Trucial Oman, if we wish to establish our air service along this coast; but the time has not yet arrived when 1 can recommend forcing ourselves on the Shaikhs regardless of consequences. 6. Sir Frederick Johnston further opines that in our dealings with these Chiefs both interference and non-interference are carried in some matters to a greater degree than is consistent with our interests. * No. I, above.102- 5 There is much lo be said for this view, but 1 think he was misled into exaggerating the extent of our interference by a recommendation from the Residency Agent that a sloop should be sent to enforce a Bunniah’s claim against an Arab of Dubai, which was received shortly before he wrote his letter. This recommendation did not amount to a desire to collect debts by bombardment, but was merely an acknowledgment of that moral influence of His Majesty’s Navy, which is so useful to us on the coast. It was not essential for His Majesty’s sloop to visit Dubai in this particular instance, but even if she had done so her presence would not necessarily have been unwelcome to the Ruler, as it would show his people that His Majesty’s Government were behind him in his attempt to enforce a just claim against a powerful subject. 7. One of the reasons for which we maintain an agent on the coast is the protection of the interests of our British subjects, who are mainly Sindi Bunniahs and Khojas. The presence of these British Indians gives us certain responsibilities, but it also gives us corresponding advantages, and l do not think it would be to our benefit that they should pack up and leave. Long experience has taught the Besidency Agent that the mere threat to-summon a sloop is the best method of dealing with continued recalcitrance. It is a gesture and nothing more. The fact that our Agent is himself an Arab makes him a much better judge than any European of the course of the secret intrigues that are always flowing on the coast. His nationality has also the disadvantage that our Agent cannot always keep himself free from undue interference in these intrigues. Khan Bahadur Isa Abdul Latif, O.B.E., is the third generation of his family to hold the post of Residency Agent, and the connection has continued for over 65 years. In this long period certain hereditary friendships and enmities have certainly been formed. The Bait Sarkali,” as the family are called, have attempted to take wives from the ruling Shaikhs, sometimes with unfortunate results ; they have built up for themselves a position of power and influence which arouses jealousy, but on the whole they have done excellent work for His Majesty’s Government, which none other than they could have performed. I recommend that we should continue to use the great influence of the family, but should attempt to supervise their work. S. At present the Residency Agent works directly under the Resident in Bushire, who visits the coast once or, if means of transport allow, twice a year. In addition the coast is visited at frequent intervals by His Majesty’s ships, whose presence has a most beneficial and tranquillising effect on the more unruly elements on land. The commanders of these ships are practically the supervising Political Agents of the coast, but their sphere extends from Ras al Had to Basrah and their term of service is confined to two years. In this short period it is impossible to learn the language and the customs or the local politics. The commanders must, in the nature of things, be largely in the hands of their interpreters. Many of these men have done some excellent nork, but the fact remains that the Resident’s appreciation of the Residency Agent’s work depends largely on the reports of Baluchi interpreters. The Residency Agent is a very astute man, and his relations with the naval interpreters are excellent. 9. The pay of our Residency Agent, who is so powerful on the coast and in many wavs so valuable, is Rs. 150 per mensem. Out of this sum he and his ancestors have hitherto nominally maintained themselves, their wives and their numerous family, as well as an armed guard for their protection. They have hospitably entertained oflicers of His Majesty’s Government, have paid for clerks, and lately have kept up a motor launch and a motor car. They have also acquired a valuable portion of the Shargah Bunaar and rich date gardens at Ras al Khaimah. Is it to be wondered at that they are the objects of insinuations for which there is no proof ? The leading Bunniahs of Dubai will tell me in confidence that all the Trucial Shaikhs subsidise our Agent and that he gets Rs. 10,00U yearly from this source; they will also tell me in confidence that our Agent takes 10 per cent, for himself in every case in which his assistance is sought; they will tell me that, acting on the advice of the Residency Agent, the Shaikh of Dubai will not permit boatmen to row them out to warships visiting the harbour ; they will tell me also that our Residency Agent engineered the trouble at Dubai in April last in order to secure his own ends, and that he secretly opposes all attempts at British penetration just as his father did in 1911; but they will not commit their complaints to writing, nor will they make them in the presence of the Residency Agent. 4006 A 2During my last visit to Dubai I asked them to propound a scheme of control for my consideration and to send it to Bushire. They promised to do so, but nothing has materialised. 10. With i •egard to the question of the appointment of a British Political Agent on the Trucial Coast, the position has not materially altered since Sir Percy Cox discussed the question in his letter No. 284 of the 2otn January 1913 : — “ We must expect the newly-elected Shaikh to continue like his predecessor in the hands of a camorra of his ignorant and reactionary relatives, and with the means at my disposal 1 see no likelihood of being able to effect any change in their attitude, as long as present conditions of British representation on the Coast are maintained, under which, though useful in other local ways, the Arab Agent of the Residency wields no appreciably helpful influence where the larger questions of British interests or policy are concerned. i\i i;r “ Our forbearance from proceeding forcibly with the inception of our mild measures of progress has borne no fruit in the past two years ; on the contrary, the Debai community has only become the more confirmed and confident in its passive obstruction, through the Shaikh, to the least advance. In fact such movement as there has been, has been retrograde, for whereas no definite objection was ever evinced to the occasional sojourn of approved Europeans for business purposes, the Shaikh has made the Hyacinth incident a pretext for refusing admission to any European or quasi-European, even as agent for the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers; and I am convinced that until we do put our foot down to check this factious obstruction we shall make no headway.” The statements made by Sir Percy Cox are still true. The Residency Agent is of the greatest assistance in most matters; but he is still unable to force through the larger issues of British policy. On the other hand, our experience at Bahrain, where the Government of India’s attempt to pursue a cautious policy failed, and finally an ultimatum, backed by force, had to be issued, shows that even British officers find it impossible sometimes to beat down the stubborn obstinacy of Arab Chiefs and their “ camorra.” 11. I have consulted the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, who is in immediate touch with the Trucial Chiefs. In the course of his reply to my enquiry, he wrote:— “. . . From many years of association with naval officers, both in days of smiles and crimes, the Trucial Arabs have developed a sort of friendship towards them, which they do not feel towards other Europeans ; but the Shaikh of Dubai last year would not agree to naval officers landing to look around the town unless accompanied by armed guards supplied by Isa or himself. The Trucial Chiefs are definitely supicious of anything which to them appears as the thin edge of the European wedge poking its nose into their territories, and any innovation will certainly be resisted, though not by any means necessarily at once or by open methods. They object to motor-cars and motor-boats, though Isa, by patient persuasion, has prevailed upon them to allow him to possess both. They object to such ideas as post offices and wireless, but when the slow mail calls at Dubai she receives letters to carry and the wireless operator receives bundles of messages to send. They frankly regard Bahrain as a typical example of the grasping hand of Britain, which, being given an inch, finally obtained possession of the whole place. Whether they are truly independent or not, they have a sturdy spirit of independence as regards determination to control their own affairs; and the first Shaikh who admits a Political Agent to be quartered upon him will be regarded as having sold his birthright. Many if not most of our steps in our progress towards developing control of the coast have been made by way of punishment (e.g. permission for Isa to fly the Jack at Shargah) and this is known to the Arabs ; in fact a Shaikh can at times keep his people under control by reminding them that if they do anything disliked by the Government the penalty will be some greater measure of Government control. Consequently the appointment of a Political Agent would be received as a serious punishment.” I have made this long quotation from the Senior Naval Officer’s opinion for comparison with Sir Percy Cox’s views of 1913 as, together, they form an admirable8 bones. Two years ago the entry of modern invention was prohibited, but now the Shaikh of Has al Khaimali is inquiring about a bord car, and has been for a flight in a flying boat; the Shaikh of Dubai has purchased a motor launch for himself; the Bahrain is having some effect on this benighted coast. 1 think it should be possible to take advantage of any advance that may be made, but the first desideratum is to restore that personal touch which vanished after 1910. 14. Before the unfortunate Hyacinth incident of 1910 the personal influence of Sir Percy Cox had gone far to break down the barriers of reserve and suspicion ; but the whole position gained was lost by that unfortunate episode, and it has never been recovered. No successor has occupied the position of Sir Percy Cox, and during a recent flying boat visit to Abu Dhabi, Captain Prior was surprised to find that not even the name of a single successor of “ Kokus ” is known in that town. This is due to lack of touch and this lack of touch was due first to the preoccupation of the war and subsequently to the withdrawal of the Pesident’s despatch vessel. To maintain touch with his large maritime command the P esi dent must have a despatch vessel, at the disposal solely ol himself and his Political Agents. It is impossible for him to share this vessel with any other department, as was shown when an attempt was made to make the same ship serve the double purpose of despatch vessel and tender to the lighthouses. Having obtained the despatch vessel, supervision over the work of the Residency Agent on the Trucial Coast should be entrusted to the Political Agent at Bahrain, who should be relieved of routine work by his Indian Assistant. The Political Agents work may be supplemented, if necessary, by the Secretary to the Resident. J he Political Agent must visit each Trucial Shaikh at least every quarter and be prepared, il necessary, to make a long halt off each town. At present the Resident pays one, or at most two, visits of one day’s duration each year. This is insufficient to inquire thoroughly into all problems, and the Residency Agent’s recommendations are perforce accepted. Inquiries regarding the various monetary claims of British subjects and into the diving debts of so-called debtors, who are usually slaves who have absconded to Bahrain, will give the Political Agent plenty of excuse for his presence. In addition, 1 am hearing most disquieting reports about the prevalence of the slave trade on this coast, and I anticipate that searching inquiries may have to be made. At first, the Political Agent must return to his ship each night; but in the course of time, as he becomes better known anti confidence is established, I hope he will be invited to stay ashore for ever lengthening periods. 15. My policy is gradually to restore, and improve on, the position which existed before the Hyacinth episode, when, as Sir Percy Cox reported, “No definite objection was ever evinced to the occasional sojourn of approved Europeans.” Having regained this position we can more easily, should we so desire, locate a British Political Agent ashore without fear of trouble. this pohc}’ is to be adopted if the Trucial Shaikhs do not compel us to take sterner measures to force through our air route. At present, the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah is showing himself obstinate in his refusal of all requests for a refuelling station at his headquarters. r lhe Shaikh of Hamariyah, a dependency of Shargah, however, has offered to rent a store-room for the use of the Royal Air Force if his lagoon should prove useful to them as a flying boat harbour. The example of this Shaikh, Abdul Rahiman bin Saif, will prove of use in breaking down the opposition of others on the coast, and the question of obtaining store-rooms will become one of pounds, shillings and pence. 1 he Royal Air Force will not be content with store-houses, however. They desire to have aerodromes, wireless stations, and rest-houses. J he erection of a wireless station formed part of the ultimatum to the Shaikh of Dubai in 1911, which was subsequently allowed to lapse. The Royal Air Force wish to settle on this coast, and this means closer contact with the coast Arabs. 1 have in para. 11 stated the final result of close contact between a strong civilised Power and a weak barbarian State. 10. Ihe Uoverninent of India do not desire increased commitments, but they are bound to come. His Majesty’s Government must be prepared, in course of time, to-9 protect their friendly Shaikhs by armed force against attack by land or sea. The position of the drucial principalities, which have a hinterland of desert, should make this a comparatively easy task, but it is an unfortunate fact that the closer the contact with the British power the more defenceless do the rulers become and, consequently, the more dependent on British support. This, however, is for the future. For the present, in connection with the air route, I anticipate no great trouble in obtaining store-houses for petrol, but difficulties will increase when we demand wireless stations manned by a permanent staff. The Residency Agent is sufficient to meet the initial demands of the lloyal Air Force, but as these increase the need for a resident Political Agent will increase. He will have to be appointed eventually, but I recommend that an attempt be made to prepare the way for the appointment. 17. Jo sum up: (1) The system of succession by murder, however inhuman, does not of itself necessarily lend to undue insecurity, as it is purely a family concern. Ho may deprecate it, but, except at the cost of interference in internal affairs, the final result of which cannot be forecasted, we cannot prevent it. I myself made a slight move during my last visit to the coast by addressing a letter to each Shaikh, in which I stated that fratricide was abhorrent to God and man, and asked their assistance in suppressing it by themselves refusing to acknowledge the succession of a fratricide. The Shaikhs one and all agreed with me in the polite Arab fashion, but 1 do not anticipate any great result from this pronouncement. (2) At present there is no undue interference on the coast. We have certain duties to perform in connection with the slave trade and the protection of British subjects, and it is only in connection with the performance of these duties that we interfere. (J) The projected air service down the coast has brought the time for the establishment of a Political Agent at Dubai considerably nearer; but as a first step the people should be familiarised with the prospect by frequent visits of a British officer in the despatch boat which is absolutely necessary to carry out this scheme. (3) 1 he Shaikhs of the frucial Goast are well disposed, provided we confine our selves to the sea, but are extremely jealous of European penetration, which they see must ultimately lead to the extinction of their independence. Every Shaikh, however well disposed he may be personally, must consider the junta and must walk warily, ihe coastal Shaikhs are by no means devoid of the avarice of the Semites, but thanks to the pearl trade they are not in the same state of poverty as the Shaikhs uf the Aden Residency area, and consequently their price is much higher. (5) I do not recommend the immediate appointment of a Political Agent to reside on the coast unless His Majesty’s Government is forced to adopt this course by the urgent demands of the Arab air route. (6)^1 can suggest no means of excluding Wahabi propaganda except self-interest. An infidel Political Agent will never be able to withstand the agents of an all-conquering Bin Sand ; but a population accustomed to the luxuries of life will not wish to be subjected to Wahabi fanaticism. p population had acquired a taste for the advantages of civilisation and the lolir.ical Agent interferes no mere than is absolutely necessary to protect British interests, ihe 1 racial (’oast should defy Wahabi propaganda just as our fleet and Air force can repulse a military attack. If the inhabitants remain in their present backward state, I see no remedy against propaganda except the word of Bin Sand and the playing off of Ghafiri against Hanawi. We can, if we wish, make ourselves extremely unpleasant to the Trucial Shaikhs and their subjects; indeed, by cutting &lt;)ff supplies and the seizure of pearling dhows we can kill all these small principalities, but by proceeding to extremes we certainly run a risk of antagonising world opinion’ which appears to be on the look out for any stick which offers for beating the British -Empire. 1 have, Ac., C. 0. J. Batik bit, Lieut.-Col., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, [P.T.O.P. 6790/29. It) IV. Views o! Government of India. Paraphrase telegram from Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India, No. 3170 S., dated '22nd October 1929. In general we agree with the views summarised in para. 17 of Barrett’s despatch No. 403 S.,* dated 5th September, copies of which were sent by mail of 19th September. That the time for the establishment of a Political Agent at Dabai will be brought considerably nearer by air service down the coast we are not, however, convinced. Extra mobility, accessibility, &amp;c., that will be afforded by the air service may, on the contrary, help to obviate its necessity. It seems possible, should the Residency have to be shifted to Bahrein, that any closer supervision and control that may be needed might admit of being effected by the Resident and the Political Agent, Bahrein, between them.
