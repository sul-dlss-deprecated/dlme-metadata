The Committee of the Privy Council have had before them :t. dated 19th August 1922, from the Minister of Customs to whom was referred a despatch from His Majesty's and Excise, to whom was referred a despatch from His Majesty's Secretary of St-to for the Colonies, dated 13th February,1922, on the subject -of ti&amp; position of the Dominion of Canada in relation to the Treaty between Great Britain and Muscat, sipner^ on the 19th M p rch, 1891, to which Canada acceded on 11th April, 1893. The Minister observes that the treaty referred to is beinp: renewed from year to year pendinr the' nerotiation of a new treaty, and that, if such a treaty is arain entered into, provision would be made to ensure thai its stipulations should &gt; not anply to any of the self-rove mi ry: Dominions unless notice to that effect were riven, and also to nrovide that it mirht be terminated separately in respect ot any Dominion to which it has been made anplicable. It is also noted that His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies desires to learn whether or not, in any agreement extending the nresent treaty, a clause rivinr the Dominions separate liberty of withdrawal should be inserted, as it may be possible to have such a clause included in the provisions of the renewal. The Minister states that he is advised that Muscat is entitled to most favoured nation treatment under the Treaty of 1891 referred to, as regards the Canadian coastinr trade, but it is understood that vessels from Muscat do not en/ra/re in this trade and that Canada does not import ppods from nor export roods to Muscat. Under an Act Respectinr the Coastinr Trade of the Dominion of Canada, assented to 15th May, 1902, ^ no roods or passenrers shall be carried by water from one port in Canada to another expept in British ships.In vie^ of the provisions of the Act Keemectinr the Coastinr' ^'rade referred to, the Minister sunmitB tliat in any a/rreeraent for the renewal of the Treaty between Groat Britain and Muaoat, it would be advisable to have a clause inserted fivinr the Dominions separate liberty of withdrawal. The ComiaitteG, concurrin,^, advise that Y n ur Excellency may be pleased to forward a cony of this Minute to the Rirht Ilonourablo the Secretary of S^ate for the Colonies in rer)ly to the despatcii above referred to.

The Secretary of State only keeps writing about it because the Colonial Office raised the question of separate withdrawal for the Dominions. But the Dominions are very little inte rested, and unless you want the revision pressed, the proposal will probably , and may well be suffered to, die a natural and unrejretted death• The same applies to revision of the tariff. 2, To save time and. copying a copy of this letter is bein^ sont direct to Rae , but a reply will be expected from you only.

Sir, With reference to your telegram'Tlo. 181-S dated 17th February 1923, I have the honour to forward for the infomation 4 of the Government of India a copy of letter from the Political with the sultan of Muscat renewing the Commercial Treaty of 1891 for a further period of one year, and embodying the clause regarding the right of the Dominion of Canada and the Common wealth of Australia to withdraw from the treaty on giving notice. Two copies only of the enclosure are being forwarded. 2. It will be seen from the Political Agent's letter that T Tis Highness is willing to prolong the treaty for a much longer period if Government will consent to his raising his Customs Tariff to 10^ and to seek the concurrence of the French and American Governments. I do not know if the Government of India are prepared to do this or whether the -present is a suitable moment for doing so. Na^or Rae thinks it desirable that the Sultan should have this right to enable him to raise more revenue and to enable him to dispense with other less lucrative and more troublesome taxation. From the local point of view an increase of revenue is certainly desirable; on the other hand if r 'uscat were empowered to raise its Tariff no doubt all the other Arab states who are limited to 5^ by No* 8-C dated 2Rth February 1923.| \gent, ''uscat, giving cover to an agreement madeby Treaty would wajit to do the saine,« perhaps Government would not wish to raise this question now and would prefer to renew the treaty annually.. .

I have received a wire from the Political Agent Maskat to the effect that al though the enhancement of the tariff will in his opinion be necessary eventually for purposes of revenue, the consent of the French and American Governments wtfl he required before any such action can be taken. • This even in favourable cir. ums! tances would take some time to procure. He therefore thinks that tariff revkbn might be taken up later, and that if possible the treaty should he revised (renewed now, leaving tariff where it is. I agree that it would probably delay matters considerably to alter tariff (sic.).

Political Officers) do not want the Commercial Treaty revised for local reasons. But the Sultan is anxious to get the Tariff increased, and to have the right to raise the import duty to 10%. If he had this, Rae says he would be quite content to renew the existing Treaty for 5 or 10 years. 3. I do not know whether Government would be prepared to agree to the 5% tariff being increased or whether a matter like this could be dealt with in a renewing clause. In any case 1 suppose we could not agree to allow the Tariff to be raised without getting France and America to agree to do the same. The present time would not, I imagine, be a propitious t for asking them to do this.21 No. 121-S,, dated Bushire, the 16th (received the 26th) March 1923.

With reference to your telegram* No. 181 -S., dated 17tli February 1923, I have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India a copy of letter (No. 8-C., dated 28th February 1923), from the Political Agent, Maskat, giving cover to an agreement made with the Sultan of Maskat renewing the Com mercial Treaty of 1891 for a further period of one year, and embodying the clause regarding the right of the Dominion of Canada and the Commonwealth of Australia to withdraw from the treaty on giving notice. Two copies only of the enclosure are being forwarded. 2. It will be seen from the Political Agent's letter that His Highness is willing to prolong the treaty for a much longer period if Government will consent to his raising his Customs Tariff to 10 per cent and to seek the concurrence of the French atid American Governments. I do not know if the Government of India are prepared to do this or whether the present is a suitable moment for doing so. Major Ra^ thinks it desirable thai the Sultan should have this right to enable him to raise more revenue and to enable him to dispense with other less lucrative and more troublesome taxation. From the local point of view an increase of revenue is certainly desirable ; on the other hand if Maskat were empowered to raise its Tariff no doubt all the other Arab states who are limited to 5 per cent, by Treaty would want to do the same. Perhaps Government would not wish to raise this question now and would prefer to renew the treaty annually. CONFIDENTIAL. No. 8 -C. of 1923. Muscat, the 28th February 1923. F rom M ajor M. E.

Letter from the Foreign Office London, to Ronald I Campbell Esqr,, Washington,No•1439, dated i3th October 1928. (/ h 'ty ' f J C. )Bo.1439 FOREIGN OPPICE, S.W.I. (A 6960/169/60) 13th October 1928. Sir, iiis majesty's Government have recentl/ been consider ing the possibility of obtaining the consent of the United States Government to the revision of articles II, III and IX of the Treaty of 1833 between the United States and kuscat, in so far as these articles are obsolete and no longer consonant with the proper administration of Zanzibar as a British Protectorate on modern lines. 2. It will be remembered that under the terms of the loan made to Liberia in 1913 ^is Majesty's Government, the French and German Governments all acquired the right of nominating a Receiver of Liberj^ian Customs: these three officers functioned under a Receiver General selected by the United States Government. In 1918 Liberia applied to the United States Government for a further loan, and as a preliminary to considering this request, the United States Government en quired whether his Majesty's Government would consent to with draw the British Receiver, if the loan were made. In a note of September 13th, 1919, to the United States Ambassador Lord Curzon agreed to this, subject to certain stipulations to safe guard British interests in Liberia. The note concluded 'In the course of discussions upon this question 'between the united States and British Peace Delegations 'at Paris, the latter intimated that this Government 'would be glad if possible to efiect with the United States 'a simultaneous settlement of certain questions relating 'to the treaty rights of United States citizens at Zanzibar 'under Ronald I. ©ampbell, Esq., etc., etc., etc., Washington.2. 'under the United States-kuscat Treat/ of 1833. 'Negotiations to this end are now in progress at 'Washington, and I have no reason to doubt but that they 'will be brought to an early and satisfactory conclusion'. 3. The history of the negotiations in question at Y/ashington is briefly as follows In a note of July 29th 1919, nis Majesty's Charge d*Affaires at Washington had represented to the United States Government that United States citizens were claiming immunity from the payment of municipal taxes under article VI of the Convention of 1833, and, by so doing, were hampering the municipality of Zanzibar in the lighting and sanitation of the city, iie enquired whether the United States Government would agree to cancel axticle VI of the treaty. To this the United States Government replied on August 12th 1919, that as long ago as 1914 they had instructed the United States Consul that they did not claim exemption for United States citizens from the payment of a 'regular and reasonable tax upon real estate'. They did not, therefore, regard it as necessary to cancel article VI. Shortly after this, viz., on August 20th 1919, Mr. Lindsay was instructed to endeavour to obtain •* the amendment of article II and article IX of the United States Treaty of 1833. Amendment of article II was desired so as to give the Zanzibar Government a free hand to prohibit the importation of undesirable goods into the Protectorate. In regard to article IX Mr. Lindsay Mvas informed that His i^iajesty's Government would be glad to secure the abrogation of the personal immunity enjoyed by United States Consular Officers under article IX of the Treaty of 1833 between the w United States and Muscat and reaffirmed by article II of the Treaty of 1886 between the United States and Zanzibar, ur. Lindsay/ V' x 3. Lindsay was instructed to inform the United States Government that this suggestion was not made on account of any objection to the past conduct of any of their consuls, but was merely designed to remove the special exemption, which was super fluous under the present settled administration. 4» x.i.r. Lindsay made representations to the United States Government in this sense, ana in a note of March 3rd 1920, was informed by the State Department in reply that that department would carefully consider any proposals which His Majesty^ Government might desire to submit. 5. However, the projected United States loan never materialised, and no further progress was made at the time \ with the above-mentioned proposals of His Lajesty's Government in regard to the United States-i-uscat Treaty.. 6. In 1925 a United States company, the Firestone Rubber Corporation, proposed to the Liberian Government to redeem Liberia's outstanding indebtedness and make a further loan to the Government in return for concessions for growing rubber. One of the conditions of this loan was that a nominee of the United States should be placed in sole control of Liberian Customs. When these proposals became Known to His Lajesty's Government, Mr. Chilton was instructed to inform the United States Government that so long as His Majesty's Government refrained from exercising their right of appointing a British Receiver, they naturally expected that the stipulations made to the United States Ambassador in Lord Curzon's note of the 13th September 1919, would be observed. Among these stipulations had been, of course, although iir. Chilton in his note to the United States Government of October 7th, 1925, aid not specifically refer to the point, the successful conclusion of the negotiations in regard to the Zanzibar treaty which were pending in Washington4. ri - •v- Washington in 19i9. 7^ The proposals made by the Firestone Company' in 1925 were adopt-ed by Liberia at. tue end of 1926 • 6 # jn pursuance of the understanding reacned between the two governments in 19x9, his Majesty's Government, have refrained in the past from re-appointing the British Receiver of Liberian Customs, and they have no doubt, in the light of the correspondence which tooic place in 1919 and 1920, that the United States Government will in their turn be disposed to give favourable consideration to proposals for the revision of treaty articles which, under modern conditions, conflict with the proper administration of the Protectorate of Zanzibar. 9 # i should accordingly be glad if you would no v. araw the attention of the United States Government to the previous correspondence with them on this subject, and particulaxly to their above -mentioned note ol Larch ord, 1920, to kr • Lindsay, and to Mr. Chilton's note of the 7th October, 1925, and would enquire whether you may assume that ti.ey are in principle prepared to fall in with the wishes of His Majesty's Government in regard to the modification ox articles II c^na IX of the Treaty. You should add that it would be su ffi c ient for the purposes of His iiajesty's Government ii the United States Government can see their v.ay to undertake;- (a) that they \.ill not interpret article IX of the United States -LIuscat Treaty of 1833, nor article II ox the Treaty of July 3rd, 1886 between the United States and Zanzibar (so far as the latter article merely re-affirms article IX of the 1833 Treaty) as justifying United States Consular Officers in claiming immunity in the Courts of Zanzibar. In putting forward this request you should once # moreiiior© make it. clear that 'tliis proposal is not made on account qf any objection to 'tlie conduct of an/ United. States Consj .1 at Zanzibar, but is merel/ designed to remove a special exemption 'which, is superfluous under the present settled administration of the Protectorate. (b) That they will not claim, in virtue of article II of the Treaty, that United States citizens are free to import into Zanzibar articles the importation of which is prohibited by the Protectorate Government, always provided that such prohibition does not discriminate against articles produceu in the United States. (c) That, in the event of the Government of Zanzibar finding it desirable on grounds of public policy to fix prices of food or other commodities, and always provided that such price-fixing measures do not involve discrimination against articles produced in the United States, tliey wij.1 not regard as operative the clause in article II of the lbo5 Treaty prohibiting the establishment by the Suluan or his officers of any fixed price on articles to be sola by merchants of the United States, or on merchandise which the latter may wish to purchase. 10. His Majesty's Government have hitherto regarded themselves as at liberty to approve the increase by the Zanzibar Government of rates of import auty into tae Protectorate, in accordance with the spirit of tne convenuion of St. Germain-en-Laye, the purpose of which was to revise the restrictive provisions ol the earlier Act oi Berlin and Declaration of Brussels so as to enable sufficient revenues to be raised for the proper administration oi certain parts of Africa in accordance with changed conditions and upon modern lines. The United States were not parties to the ActAct of Berlin nor, consequently, to the Declaration of Brussels, nor were they parties to the convention of St. Gerrnain-en-ija/e. Nevertheless His kajesty t s Government assume that the United States Government do not, under x ^resent circumstances, insist upon the limitation to a maximum of ten per cent ad valorem, in accordance with the terms of article 1 of the Convention of the 31st ka/, 190^, 'between Great Britain and the United States, of the import duties upon merchandise imported into the Protectorate. On similar grounds His .ulajesty's Government assume that the United States Government do not insist, in virtue of article III of the Treaty of September iilst i833, between the United States and ^uscat, cyn the limitation of export duties raised by the Zanzibar Government. You shoula request the United States Government to confirm to you that these assumptions are correct. I am, etc., Sd/- i .M* ^now.3^ CONFIDENTIAL. No. U-Jh S- 0 f 1923.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty^s Government have recently been considering the question of revising, subject to the consent of the United States Government, articles 2, 3 and 9 of the Treaty of 1833 between the United States and Muscat, insofar as these articles are obsolete and no longer consonant with the proper administration of Zanzibar as a British Protectorate on modern lines# I have now received instruction from His Majesty's Acting Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to draw your attention to the previous correspon dence between His Majesty t s Government and the United States Government on the subject and to enquire whether I may assume that your Government are in principle prepared to fall in with the wishes of His Majesty^ Government in regard to the modifica tions of the articles in question, as set forth in the concluding paragraphs of this note. 2. It will be remembered that under the terms of the loan made to Liberia in 1913 His Majesty^ Government, the French and German Governments all acquired the right ol nominating a Receiver of Liberian Customs: these three officers functioned under a Receiver General selected by the United States Government* In 1913 Liberia applied to the United States Government for a further loan, and as a preliminary to considering this request, the United States Government enquired wnether His Majesty's Government would consent to withdraw the British Receiver, if the loan were made. In a note of September 13th 1919, to the United States Ambassador in London Lord Gurzon agreed to this, subject to certain stipulations The Honourable Frank B.Kellogg, Secretary of State of the United States, Washington, D.C. «=• ntstipulations which, were considered necessary to safeguard British interests in Liberia. The note concluded:- rt In the course of discussions upon this question 'between the United States and British Peace Delegations at Paris, the latter intimated that this Government would be glad if possible to effect with the United States a simultaneous settlement of certain questions relating to the treaty rights of United States citizens at Zanzibar under the United States - Muscat Treaty of 1833. 'Negotiations to this end are now in progress at Washington, and I have no reason to doubt but that they will be brought to an early and satisfactory conclusion H . 3. The history of the negotiations in question at Washington is briefly as follows:- In a note of July 29th, 1919, His Majesty^s Charge d # Affaires at Washington represented to the United States Government that United States citizens were claiming immunity from the payment of municipal taxes under article VI of the Convention of 1833, and, by so doing, were hampering the municipality of Zanzibar in the lighting and sanitation of the city. He enquired whether the United States Government would agree to cancel article VI of the treaty. To this the United States Government replied on August i2th, 1919, that as long ago as 1914 they had instructed the United States citizens from the payment of a 'regular and reasonable tax upon real estate'. They did not, therefore, regard it as necessary to cancel article VI. 4. In a note dated September 25th, 1919, Mr. Lindsay on instructions from His Majesty's Principal becretary Ox State for Foreign Affairs, informed the United States Government that His Majesty^ Government were desirous of securing the amendment of article 2 of the Treaty, so as to give the Government of Zanzibar a free hand to prohibit the importation of undesirable goods into the Protectorate, and also the abrogation of the personal immunity enjoyed by UnitedUnited States Consular Officers under article 9 of the Treaty and reaffirmed by article 2 of the Treaty of 1886 between the United States and Zanzibar. He made it clear at the same time that the suggestion of His Majesty's Government was not pu^forward on account of any objection on their part to the past conduct of any United States Consul, but was merely designed to remove the special exemption which was superfluous under the present settled admini stration. 5. In a note dated March 3, 1920&gt; the state Department replied that they would carefully consider any proposals which His Majesty's Government might desire to submit. 6. The projected United States loan to Liberia, howevei never materialised and no further progress was made at the time with the abovementioned proposals of His Majesty^ Government in regard to the United States-Muscat Treaty. 7. In 1925 a United States company, the Firestone Rubber Corporation, proposed to the Liberian Government to redeem Liberia^ outstanding indebtedness and make a further loan to the Government in return for concessions for growing rubber. One of the conditions of this loan was that a nominee of the United States should be placed in sole control of Liberian Customs. ',Vhen these proposals became known to His Majesty's Government, Mr. Chilton was instructed to inform the United States Government that so long as His Majesty's Government refrained from exercising their right of appointing a British Receiver of Liberian Customs, they naturally expected that the conditions placed before the United States Ambassador in Lord Curzorfs note of the 13th September 1919, would be observed. 8. In the note which he consequently addressed to the State Department on October 7th, 1925, Mr. Chilton drew attention to Lord Curzon's note defining the terms on which His Majesty's Government had agreed to the withdrawal of thethe British Receiver. .Vhile thus drawing general attention to those terms» Mr« Chilton did not at the time think lit to make any more definite reference to Zanzibar, the position being that, for the reasons above explained, no definite arrangement in regard to Zanzibar had ever been reaohed. 9. The proposals made by the Firestone Company in 1925 were adopted by Liberia at the end of 1926* 10. In pursuance of the understanding reached between the two governments in 1919* His Majesty's Government have refrained in the past from re-appointing the British Receiver of Liberian Customs, and they have no doubt, in the light of the above considerations and of the correspondence which took place in 19i9 and 1920, particularly the State Departiuen note of March 3, 1920, referred to in paragraph 4 above, that the United States Grovernment will in their turn be disposed to give favourable consideration to proposals for the revision of treaty articles which, under modern condition conflict with the proper administration of the Protectorate of Zanzibar. 11. It would be sufficient for the purposes of His Majesty* s Government if the United States jovernmeTiu could see their way to undertakes- (a) that they will not interpret article IX of the United States-Muscat Treaty of 1833, nor article II of the Treaty of July 3rd, 1886, between the United States and Zanzibar (so far as the latter article merely re-affirms article IX of the 1833 Treaty) as justifying United States Consular Officers in claiming immunity in the Courts of Zanzibar. (b) That they will not claim, in virtue of article II of the Treaty, that United States citizens are free zo import into Zanzibar articles the importation of which is prohibited by the Protectorate Government, always provided thatthat such prohibition does not discriminate against articles produced in the United States. (c) That, in the event of the Government of Zanzibar finding it desirable on grounds of public policy to fix prices of food or other commodities, and always provided that such price-fixing measured do not involve discrimination against articles produced in the United States, they will not regard as operative the clause in Article II of the 1833 Treaty prohibiting the establishment by the Sultan or his officers of any fixed price on articles to be sold by merchante of the United States or on merchandise which the latter may wish to purchase. 12. In putting forward the first of the above requests, I am once more to explain that this proposal on the part of His Majesty's Government is not made on account of any objection to the conduct of any United States Consul in Zanzibar, but is merely designed to remove a special exemption which is superfluous under the present settled administration of the Protectorate. 13. As regards article 3 of the United States-Muscat Treaty, I am to offer the following observations on the part of my Government and to request you to be so good as to confirm to me on behalf of the United States Government that the assumptions of His Majesty^s Government are correct. 14. His Majesty^ Government have hitherto regarded themselves as at liberty to approve the increase by the Zanzibar Government of rates of import duty into the Protectorate, in accordance with the spirit of the convention of St. Germain-on-Lays, the purpose of which was to revise the restrictive provisions of the earlier Act of Berlin and Declaration of Brussels so as to enable sufficient revenues to be raised for the proper administration of certain parts of Africa in accordance with changed conditions and upon modern lines. The United States were not parties to the Act of Berlin nor, consequently, to the Declaration of Brussels, nor• / nor were they parties to the convention of St. Germain-on-Lays Nevertheless His Majesty^ Government assume that the United States Government do not, under present circumstances, insist upon the limitation to a maximum of ten per cent ad valorem, in accordance with the terms of article 1 of the Convention of the 31st May, 1902, 'between Great Britain and the United States of the import duties upon merchandise imported into the Protectorate. On similar grounds His Majesty^ Government assume that the United States Government do not insist, in virtue of article III of the Treaty of September ^^t, 1833 , be tweeny duti es raised 'by the Zanzibar j-overmnent. x I have, etc., (Signed) SSMS HOWARD.35/86 1368-12/7/29 Telegram code irrom f. &amp; p.
