Position of Chief Political Officer (Sir Percy Cox). 1. The question of the civil administration of Mesopotamia was first considered by the Committee shortly after the capture of Baghdad. Their conclusions were communicated to the Government of India in a telegram from the Secretary of State dated the 29th March 1917, of which the following paragraphs may be quoted in full:— “ (4) Behind Arab facade Baghdad to be administered as an Arab Province by indigenous agency and in accordance with existing laws and institutions as far as possible. In particular (a) Irak Code not to be used, but local judicial system maintained as regards both law and personnel, only substituting Arab for Turk; (b) similarly with executive and administrative machinery, tribal system of Govern ment, provincial and local councils, &amp;c., to be resuscitated and maintained ; (c) present land revenue system not- to be disturbed ; (d) employment of Indians in any branch of administration to be strictly discountenanced as inconsistent with above principles, and no Asiatics from outside to be employed unless of Persian or Arab # descent or domicile. The same to apply as far as possible to Basra Vilayet. •#;r *•' “Lastly .—It is regarded of utmost importance that administrative arrangements introduced into Baghdad \ ilayet should fiom the verv outset strictly conform to above principles. Please instruct Cox to this effect at once with special reference to Head 4, and telegraph with least possible delay any remarks you may wish to make on anj of these heads for consideration of War Cabinet before they reach final decision.” 2 2. Sir P. COX’S comments on these proposals were communicated to the Secretary of State in a telegram dated the 7th April 1917 (No T. 1049). After expressing general concurrence in the lines ot policy contemplated by His Majesty’s Government, he proceeded as follows :— “ Both Army Commander and I, however, are strongly of opinion that when His Majesty’s Government contemplate formally introducing above principles during the existence of martial law, and \\hile the military position of Baghdad is as it is (namely, that we are in almost daily conflict with Arab tribes ahead of us, and that unless determined Russian advance is made, of which at present there is no evidence, we must expect severe fighting around Baghdad when enemy has had time to recover and concentrate fresh troops against us), the} aie takino- too much for granted, and are making demands upon us which mav at any time, and in many particulars, be incompatible both with the military interests at stake and the freedom of action ol i\rmv Commander, whose Chief Political Staff Officer I am. At same time*His Majesty’s Government may rest assured that I accept their policy in principle, and that as long as I am here I will proceed on the spirit of it as far as possible and do nothing which I can avoid either in principle or in detail to prejudice its complete inauguration when the time comes. Army Commander desires me to convey similar assurance on his behalf. S 367 30 8 17 A3. After further consideration of the subject by the Committee, the Secretary Of State telegraphed as follows to the Government of India and Sir Cox on the 10th May 1917 '‘His Majesty’s Government desire to assure you at once that they do not contemplate immediate establishment of an Arab administration on principles indicated in my telegram of 29th March. They fully realise that military situation requires that Army Commander and Chief Politics^ Officer should have free hand, but what they are concerned about is that nothing that can be avoided should be done during military occupation that would prejudice subsequent intro duction of above-mentioned principles, and in particular establish ment of separate administrative systems for Basra and Baghdad. Subject to clear understanding on this point, Cox may carry on in consultation with Army Commander as heretofore, until whole problem has been examined and reported on by a Commission 1 as he suggests. Such questions as administrative councils, permanent judicial system, regulation of Indian immigration, Ac., are reserved for consideration of Commission. Meanwhile only such minimum of administrative efficiency should be aimed at as is necessary to preserve order and meet needs of occupying force. Amendment of laws and introduction of reforms should be kept within narrowest possible limits.” 4. So far, as his telegram of the 7th April {see paragraph 2) indicates, Sir P. Cox’s views were apparently in complete accord with those of General Sir Stanley Maude. The first intimation of a difference of outlook between them was conveyed in a “personal” telegram from Sir P. COX to the India Office, dated the 25th May 1917, in which he reported that the position had become unsatisfactory from a political point of view. He proceeded :— “ General Maude’s military successes have established his reputation as a soldier beyond all criticism, but he is purely a soldier and without any previous experience of the East or of Orientals, and I find him, as is only natural, unsympathetic and somewhat intolerant in regard to political problems and unable to appreciate important bearing of apparently simple problems of daily occurrence on larger political and even military interests. “ With the limited power which I at present possess as his Chief Political Officer, which gives me no right to report to Government, and having regard to his pronounced divergence of outlook, I find myself unable to make good the undertaking which I have given to Government to allow' nothing to be done calculated to prejudice their declared policy, and I realise that if that policy is to be safeguarded I must be placed in a stronger position vis-a-vis the Army Commander, and at any rate be given right to send a regular report weekly or fortnightly to higher authority to keep them au fait with current questions and at large. As His Majesty’s Government are awmre, I have no ulterior ambitions here, and am quite ready to resign if that course is convenient to them, but if it is desired that I should remain, my hands must be strengthened. If this could best be done by making me High Commissioner nominally, I would no longer oppose it provided it is understood that it does not connote any more extensive introduction or Arab administration than was recently agreed upon, but simply placing His Majesty’s Government in a better position to keep themselves closely informed of political developments in the new' territory.” 1 This refers to a proposal made by Sir P. Cox in his telegram of the 7th April (see para- grapn -), and accepted by His Majesty s Government, that a “ Commission of tirst-rate men ” should be sent out to Mesopotamia in the autumn of 1917 “to examine the whole problem on the spot. r5. A few days later Mr. Storrs, of the Egyptian service, who was on temporary deputation to Basra, telegraphed privately to the Foreign Office (3rd June 1917)-that “owing to the unsympathetic attitude of the military “ to the Chief Political Officer’s advice and recommendations, we are in “ danger of losing ground with the population, on the whole very friendly “ disposed, with grave prejudice to the present and subsequent policy as “ enunciated by His Majesty’s Government.” He added:—“ Prestige of “ Chief Political Officer is very high throughout the country, and anything “ done to strengthen his hand would tend to strengthen our hold on the “ sympathies of the best and most powerful elements, without being in any “ wa y incompatible with the necessary supremacy of the military.” 6. The Government of India endeavoured to find a solution of the difficulty by inviting Sir P. Cox to proceed on leave to Simla to explain his grounds of complaint, which (as they remarked to the Secretary of State) “ appear somewhat vague.” This suggestion, however, did not commend itself to Sir P. Cox and* was not pressed. I4 2 - 7. The whole question was again carefully considered by the Committee, with the result that, after consultation with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who concurred in the terms of the proposed telegram “ subject to what the Viceroy may reply,” the Secretary of State telegraphed as follows to the Viceroy and Sir P. Cox on the 4th July 1917 : “ Ju pursuance of the policy laid down by them and for their guidance in settling questions which must arise from time to time, His Majesty s Government think it necessary that the 3 T should iecei\e regular and frequent information as to the political and economic condition of the territorv and the establishment of civil institutions and be able to satisfy themselves as to the progress made in carrying out their policy. # in, “They propose, therefore, that the Chief Political Officer shall be^ gnen the rank of Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia, and shall in that capacity submit reports on these matters at regular intenals 3} mail and telegraph for their information. . . “ The Army Council are strongly of opinion that in view of the present militarv situation, the ultimate responsibility of the General Officer Commanding must remain unimpaired. His Majesty s Government concur, and in giving the Chief Political Officer the status of Civil Commissioner, His Majesty’s Government do not propose to set up in the occupied territories a civil administration independent oi the militarv authority. So long as military conditions prevail the General Officer Commanding, subject to the control of liis Majestv’s Government, is the ultimate seat of authority, lo make this clear, His Majesty’s Government propose that the reports ol the Civil Commissioner should be submitted to me through the General Officer Commanding, who will forward them with any obsen ations which he may wish to make. It will be clearly understood by both the Civil Commissioner and the General Officer Commanding that His Majesty’s Government desire that the opinion and advice of the Civil Commissioner should be given freely and to the best of his judgment in these reports. As by degrees normal conditions are re-established in parts of the territories and the civil staff is increased and strengthened, it will be natural and desirable that a laiger measure of independence should be conceded in civil affairs to .im C ommissioner.” It should be explained that Mr. Chamberlain’s telegram contained no reference to Sir P. Cox’s “ personal ” telegram of the ~Oth May (see para- «anh 4) the proposals' which it conveyed purported to be merely a development -of t,he P policy laid down in the Secretary of State s earlier telegrams of the 29th March and the 10th May (»ee paragraphs 1 and 3). S 367 A 28. Telegraphing to the War Office on the 9th July 1917 (No. X. 2782) General Maude took strong exception to the proposals con tained in the Secretary of State’s telegram. He adhered to the views expressed in Sir P. Cox’s telegram of the 7th April (see paragraph 2). He pointed out that the military position at Baghdad was still insecure and that further severe fighting was to be anticipated in the autumn and winter. He expressed no anxiety as to the result “ provided my hands are not otherwise tied and we are not swamped by numbers,” but went on to make an appeal for a “ free hand ” in the following terms :— “ I would ask that I should be given every opportunity to concentrate my whole energies on this issue/ and that development of civil administration of Baghdad Vilayet, except as regards such matters as clearly do not clash with military .necessity, and which we are already taking in hand, should wait until we are securely established here once for all. We are engaged in a vast war, the issues of which are vital, and it seems to me that if we attempt to combine general development of country with defeat of enemy, we shall be attempting too much, and we shall fail. A commander in the field has great responsibilities, and he must devote every moment available to task before him in order to ensure success. “ If, then, civil considerations which may conflict with military interests are urged upon him repeatedly, though, no doubt, unintentionally, owing, perhaps, to military situation not being viewed exactly in true perspective, and if he is not free to resist them, his anxieties and his already heavy duties will be considerably increased, and his attention will be constantly distracted from what is for time bein^ the main issue. It is one thing for a commander to know instinctively, as he should do, when a project will prejudice his military plans ; it is another matter for him amid stress of war to have to justify his opinion. For instance, should proposals which would hamper General Officer Commanding’s plans be propounded, General Officer Commanding would then, in forwarding them, have to record for you reasons for differing, and in order to do so intelligently at this distance from England, much time and labour would be necessary, possibly at a time of great pressure, and even then his points might •not be made quite clear to thbse unfamiliar with existing local military considerations. For these reasons I would submit very earnestly for consideration that we should first concentrate our whole energies on winning the war, and that future of this country which . has already waited development so long will not be seriously prejudiced even if certain steps on road of progress have to wait another year. “ I can assure His Majesty’s Government that I realise that it is not onlv duty, but that it is my wish, to see that development of civil administration of this country shall be pushed forward as far as can conveniently be done without conflicting with military necessities The many directions in which such development is taking place already are best proof in support of this statement.” 9 9. Sir P. Cox’s comments on the proposals of His Majesty’s Govern- ment were communicated in a telegram dated the 25th July 1917 (ho. 2768). He explained that the views expressed in his telegram of the an April (see paragraph 2) were based on the experience of the preceding two and a half years, but that the events of the past three months had caused mm to modify his opinion to some extent for the following reasons : “ Granted that vve are both imbued with the fullest desire to make good ra n CeS wlnch we hpve given to Government, yet in practice many difficult questions arise in regard to which there is room for considerable divergence of view as to what is or is not in the interests of Government or in harmony with spirit of their policy, and even in our own particular sphere neither Army Commander nor I can lavclaim to infallibility. I am consequently brought to opinion that it would be more satisfactory for His Majesty’s Government, as well as fairer to each of us, that the former should receive regular and frequent reports which will both keep them posted in regard to progress of their policy, and will incidentally enable them to satisfy themselves that a just balance is being maintained between military and political or civil interests. In short, as regards question of reports I am entirely in favour of it, more especially in view of probability that military situation during the coming winter will preclude assembly of the proposed Commission 1 as early as was expected. Sir P. Cox’s telegram ended as follows “ My sole concern is that the civil and political interests of Government shall be adequately safeguarded. In regard to these interests whatever may be my nominal title or status vis-a-vis the Army Commander, and notwithstanding his supreme authority, the mere fact of my having been here throughout the period makes it impossible that I can be divested completely of personal responsibility whether present or ultimate.” 10. The Government of India telegraphed on the 30th July 1917:— “ We trust His Majesty’s Government realise that these difficulties have arisen between Maude and Cox simply through Coxs desire to carry out loyally and faithfully policy indicated by His Majest} s Government. Events have proved immediate carrying out of that policy is impossible : and we have no hesitation in regarding Maude s arguments as unanswerable. Until military position in Baghdad Vilayet is completely secured, General Officer Commanding must ‘obviously concentrate on military problems untrammelled by con troversial political or civil considerations. e feel sine Maude appreciates enormous value of Cox’s advice on civil and political questions as much as we do, and will be guided by it^ so^ far as military position admits. But we trust that llis Majesty s Go\ em inent will agree to drop the proposals put forward in }Oiir telegram under reply, so as to leave Maude free from all extraneous preoccupations until situation clears. •11 On the 1st August 1917 Sir William Robertson wrote to Mr! Montagu suggesting that, in view of the Government of India s ;elegram of the 30th July (see paragraph 10) “the matter of civil mhn j m ' 5 tration in Mesopotamia be dropped for the present. He agreed that ‘ General Maude must be left free to devote his wnole time to the fighting ‘ which we are expecting to take place. ’ • 12 The actual points at issue between General Maude and Sir ’ Cox are not altogether easy to define, but there seems no reason &gt; conclude that their views are entirely irreconcilable. General Maude as not taken formal exception to the proposed change of Sir 1. tmx s esignation to “Civil Commissioner &lt; nor has he raised objections i principle to Sir P. Cox reporting direct to His _ Majesty s Govern ment. His opposition to the arrangements proposed is based on the fear fiat “civil considerations which may conflict with military interests will &gt;e constantly urged upon him, thereby distracting his attention from the lain military problem; and that his labours will be great y mcieased &gt;y the recurring necessity of formulating his views on the civil authontie^ Proposals in such a way as to render his attitude fully intelligible to His 1 See footnote to paragraph 3.6 Majesty’s Government. r lhis difficulty ought to be capable of adjustment if it is made perfectly clear both to General Maude and Sir P. Cox that what His Majesty’s Government require from the latter is information, not controversial proposals or elaborate administrative schemes. For the present Sir P. Cox’s reports might be transmitted direct to the Secretary of State without putting the General to the trouble of acting as a channel of com munication; and an undertaking might be given that, until the military situation is clearer, these reports will ordinarily be regarded by His Majesty’s. Government as sent to them for information only, and not as a basis for administrative proposals. If an agreement could be reached on these lines, the main object of His Majesty’s Government, viz., to obtain further information, would be achieved, without adding appreciably to the labours of the General Officer Commanding until such time as the period of intense military pre-occupation is over. The view expressed in the Viceroy’s telegram of the 30th July (see paragraph 10) that the difficulties that have arisen are due solely to Sir P. Cox’s desire—about which there can be no question—to carry out loyally the policy of His Majesty’s Government will not bear examination. It is clear from Sir P. Cox’s own telegrams (see paragraphs 4 and 9), and from Mr. Storrs’s report (see paragraph 5), that there are differences of opinion and temperament between him and General Maude which can no longer be disguised.
