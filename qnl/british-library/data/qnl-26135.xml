Prom To Lieut. Colonel Sir Bernard Reilly, KCMG., CIE., QBE., Chief Commissioner, ADEN. The Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Industries and Labour, NEW DELHI. Subject:-Transfer of Aden. Post Office Insurance Fund, Sir, I have the honour to refer to the Rules relating to Postal Life Insurance and Endowment Assurance from which it is observed that provision is made for persons who have once been admitted to the benefits of the Post Office Insurance Fund and who may quit the service of the Government of India to continue to enioy their rights and interests in any life insurance or endowment assurance policy so long as all payments due are regularly made. Policy holders who on separation of Aden from India elect to enter the service of the Colony, or who continue to serve in Aden temporarily on foreign service, will thus have their rights and interests preserved to them provided satisfactory arrangements can be made in regard to payment of xDremia. 2. As from the 1st April next the Government of the Colony will be prepared to make arrangements to collect premia from existing policy holders on the same basis as at present, viz. monthly in advance, and to credit receipts to India in the following monthly account, I shall be grateful if you will advise me whether this proposal is satisfactory to you. If it is you will no doubt consider whether it is necessary to promulgate rules2 rules which will provide for payment of premia in the Colony of Aden being regarded as equivalent to payment at a Post Office in India in so far as these men are concerned.

The attached statement supplies the information required regarding the scales of pay and conditions of service in respect of leave, pension^ etc. for members of the-staff employed in the Postal and Telephone Services of Aden. 3. It is estimated that only five members of the staff recruited in India are unwilling to continue to serve at Aden after its transfer from^j the control of the Government of India. Appointments for these men can be found in India. No question of pensionary concessions to such persons is therefore likely to arise, 4. Of tne staff recruited locally in Aden for service there, a number are reported to be unwilling to continue to serve after transfer. Ihey have been informed that they cannot expect to be retained in the service of the Government of India after the transfer and that there is no pos- sibility of their receiving posts in India. Provided that they are guaranteed terms and conditions not less favourable than those which govern them at present, the Government of India consider that they can have no sufficient reason for declining to continue in service and that no equitable case for compensation would arfse if any of than persisted .K * * 2 3 OCT 936 I Uvt.

The Government of India understand that the reluctance of some of the employees to continue to serve there after the transfer is due to uncertainty as to their pay and pros pects under the new administration. If assurances are given to the staff that their services will continue to be on exactly the same terms and conditions as those under which they are at present serving, the number unwilling to continue in service should be materially reduced, 5, The reasons for suggesting financial adjustments between India and Aden are recorded in the memorandum which accompanied Mr,Nixon’s letter No. D-1079/Ref./36, da.ted the 7th May 1936 to the Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, The necessity for the payment of the capital value of the Post Office and Telephone buildings and other assets referred to in paragraph 8 of the memoran dum has been accepted by the Colonial Office subject to the question of a revision of the rate of depreciation.

The Somaliland Government, it is believed, maintain a similar Bank.RESIDENCY, Aden, 5th May 193,6. refer to Lai thwaite r s letter 4th December 1933 enclosing copies of my letter of the 10th August 1933 on points arising in connection with the transfer of Aden, and of the minutes of the meeting at the Foreign Office at which my letter was discussed? As it has been proposed that 1 should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Office and the Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing the fourteen points that were then discussed, ard adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. 1 also enclose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India.

Post Office and Telephones , In November 1933 the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of Indie sent me the following information on this subject:- 'The total receipts and expemditure of Aden Head 'post office and the five post offices under it 'for the past three years are 'As regards tele phones ? as the Aden telephone 'system was taken over by the Indian Posts and 'Telegraphs Department only from the 1st July '1932, when the whole system was reconstructed, 'it is not possible to give any reliable estimate 'of profit and loss. From the various estimates 'which have, however, been prepared from time to 'time, it is computed that approximately a sum 'of Rs.1,63,200 has been spent by the Indian 'Posts and Telegraphs Department on the work of 'remodelling the system, including capital^ 'expenditure on buildings, and on this basis, 'the annual expenditure on Interest, Depreciation, 'Maintenance, Establishment and Overheads, etc., 'is computed at Rs.42,700, approximately, 'exclusive of (1) battery charges (2) hot and 'cold weather charges, (3) lighting (4) stationery 'and printing and (5) other contingent charges. 'The receipts for the first year are 'reported to be Rs.58,710 but as already remarked 'this is based on pure estimates and is 'susceptible of modification.' Receipts Rs. Expenditure Rs.

With regard to the Post Office figures I assume that the receipts include the proceeds of the sale of stamps, but I do not know whether the expenditure figures include the cost of printing them. The printing of stamps for Aden will in future presumably be arranged by the Colonial. Office, and the cost debited to Aden, and it will be of interest to know what the annual expenditure on this account is likely to be. With regard to telephones, it will be seen from the Government of India letter that I have quoted that approximate ly a sum of Rs.1,63,200 was spent in 1932-33 by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department on the work of remodelling the system including the capital expenditure on buildings. It must be d ecided whether this sum is to b e paid to the Government of India by His Majesty’s Government or by the new Aden Administration. It appears to me undesirable that the new Colony should commence its existence burdened by a debt of this nature, and I hope therefore that the payment can be made by His Majesty’s Government. In this connection I wish to refer to Point 14 in the minutes of the meeting held at the Foreign Office in 1933, which recorded my suggestion that all Government buildings at Aden should be transferred free of cost by the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government (and by the latter to the new Aden Government). If this principle is accepted, the Government of India’s expenditure on telephone buildings should be excluded from the sum to be paidto them for the telephone system. A reduction should also be made on account of depreciation of the system during the years since it was installed. At present both the Aden Post Office and the Aden Telephones are directly but separately under the control of-4- % ' ^ v_ 4^) ^ the Postmaster General, Bombay, who s ends to Aden a Postmaster and an Officer in charge of Telephones. Neither of these officials is in any way subordinate to the other; their work is conducted independently of each other in Aden, although they are both under the same control in India. After the transfer it would probably be necessary that both Posts and Telephones should be placed under the combined control of an officer responsible to the new Government, and that there should therefore be an Officer in charge of Aden Posts and Telephones. I suggest that this officer be obtained on deputation from the Government of India, unless the Colonial Office can supply him. A tentative provision for the cost of his appointment has been made in the Draft Estimates. An alternative that has been suggested to me is that the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department should continue to work the Aden Post Offices and Telephones for a few years after the transfer, as I understand was done in the case of the Iraq Post Offices. If the administration of the Postal and Telephone Departments is taken over by the new Aden Goveriment it is probable that additional s taff will be necessaiy in the Post Office for maintaining Exchange accounts and in the Telephone Department for billing and accounting, work which at present is done in Bombay; and with the appointment of a Director of Posts and Telephones it will still be necessary to have two subordinate officers in separate charge of each of the departments under the Director. The retention of control by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department would obviate the necessity for additional expenditure of this nature. I do not, however, know whether the Indian Department would be prepared to manage the Aden Post Offices and Telephones on behalf of the Aden Government, or, if so, on what terms they would be willing to do so. I suggest, however, that this possibility be examined by the Colonial Office, and that, if there is no objection to it in principle, it should be discussed with the Government of India.March 1936, froio the Chief Oomaisstoner, Aden, to the Secretary to the Government of India, loreign and Political Department, New DelhW—. r Air Officer aocinianding, British forces, Aden, has represented to me that Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department require guarantee for a period of five years in respect of following telephone requirements, vizi- (1) Exchange Line, Aden Bxchange to Bofcat Telephone No.79 (2) Direct Line Shum Shorn to Boyal Artillery, Beport Centre, Chapel Hill installed for military purposes during present emergency period, and has asked that, as it is impracticable to give such guarantee in present oi rc urns tan oe s, matter he referred to authorities concerned with a view to its canoe nation. 2.

I see that it is suggested by the Government of India that members of the staff at Aden who are unwilling to serve after the transfer should be compulsorily retired, and that His Majesty’s Government should be called upon to bear a proportion of the charges for their pensions. I think that we should have to resist any such proposal. We shall be under an obligation to offer all such officers a continuance of their service under the same conditions, as nearly as may be, as they at present enjoy. If they do not wish to continue in service on those terms, we can accept no further responsibility I have only one material comment to make on for J.C.

I do not think that we should be in a position to express any opinion on the merits of the proposed scale of charges until we have been able to look into the working of the telephone system. For instance, the basis on which the accounts are drawn up is not clear to me in some particulars. I am not aware how the funds for the original capital expenditure were raised; presumably they were advanced from the general revenues of tlie Government of India; if so 5|r per cent, seems a heavy rate of interest with which to burden the undertaking at the present time. Further, I do not understand the percentage charges for maintenance; are not the actual charges for maintenance M.J. GLAUSON, ESQ.' » a maintenance work ascertainable? These are small points, and possibly need not affect the actual decision to reduce charges by a round percentage. The reductions proposed seem to leave the undertaking in a financially sound position, and if the Air Ministry are pressing for reductions, which can clearly be granted without risk, I think that we should prefer that you should deal with the matter, on the understanding that we shall be at liberty to consider further variations of the charges after we have had, say, a year ! s experience of the working of the system.

Dear Turner, We have been considering the position of those smaller Colonies and Dependencies which, although in a position to benefit from the Empire Air Mail Scheme, have not yet been formally invited to participate, and the question of the inclusion of Aden has been raised. 2« Fran a postal point of view, we understand that Aden is administered by the Indian Postal Department. It is not possible, therefore, to ascertain the annual weight of mails to be dealt with, this being included in the Indian figures, and no question of a separate postal contribution arises. 3. From the aspect of subsidy payments, the prior question arises as to whether you consider it is for the United Kingdom G-overnment to arrange for the issue of a formal invitation to participate in the Scheme, or whether this territory should be regarded, in view of the postal arrangements, as covered by the settlement with the IndiaiGovernment. If not, the question arises whether it should now be invited to participate in the scheme, subject to the payment of a small annual subsidy contribution. If you favour the latter course, we would suggest a suitable contribution based on such factors as those outlined in the Blue Paper. 4. We do not wish to press this matter in any way if you regard the territory in question as adequately covered by the settlement with India. Yours sincerely.P.Z.615/36.

As the previous papers are somewhat voluminous I shall attempt to give you a brief summary of the main facts of the case. When Aden was entirely under the control of the G.of I. the telephone system was a combined civil and military system and was managed by the Defence Light Section. When, however, the Air Ministry took over the military administration, a difficulty arose as the Air ^'orce had no ground staff to work and maintain the old system. The G.of 1. therefore decided to replace the old system, which was antiquated and inefficient, by a new automatic system. It was estimated, however, that under this automatic system there would be a considerable annual deficit, and a good deal of haggling ensued as to who was to meet it. A solution was eventually reached by th e G.of I. 1 s scrapping ie idea of an automatic system and iKjhd installing a single centrally situated exchange worked on a central battery system. In order to obviate the risk of an annual loss, it was decided/decided to charge higher rates than previously for connections, and the principal subscribers (the Royal Air Force and the Government of Bombay) were required to give an undertaking that they would maintain their existing number of connections. The present charges are: Direct Telephone connection within a radius of three Rs.400 p.a. miles from the Exchange. For longer direct connections. Internal extension External connection An extra Rs.50 j)er - 5 - mile. Rs.120 Rs.bO^per ^-mlle in addition to Rs.l20 r 'for the instruments. The number of connections calculated in 1931 was: R.A.F . Direct connections Extensions Bombay Govt . Direct connections Extensions private Direct connections Extensions 42 20 25 8 44 27 On this basis it was calculated that the annual revenue derived from the rentes would be approximately Rs.51,000. The capital cost of the new scyviiye Ia/0l4 _ % (which « ^ be-borne by the G.of I.) was estimated at Rs.248,600 and the annual expenditure,|including the interest on capital cost ; a*d’ depreciation, establishments and maintenance), was estimated/Draft Paper. fr*****' Lx*i. /tvA* (KA\*I &lt;kdC(A*. fy\ itv.

In order to remove the risk of annual a loss the G.of 1. proposed that a higher rate than previously should be charged for connections and that the principal subscribers (the Royal Air Force and the Government of Bombay) should be required to give an undertaking to maintain their existing number of connections. These X * proposals were accepted by the Air Ministry on the condition that a general review of the financial arrangements should be undertaken at the end of three years. In May of this year the Air Ministry requested that the review might be undertaken (see their letter at P.Z.3308/35), and we have now received the G.of I. 1 s report on the workings of the telephone system since its inauguration. In the years 1933-35, for which figures are available, receipts show a substantial excess over expenditure and there is therefore a clear case for reducing rentals charged. ^et^/the G.of I. suggest two alternatives. (1) That a moderate reduction should be made in the rates for all classes of connections. (2) That a substantial decrease should be made in the rate charged for direct connections. The G.of I. favour the second alternative, and as a substantial majority of the revenue is derived from direct connections it seems just that these subscribers should receive the benefit of the reduction. As Aden is about to be handed over to H.M.G. in the near future, it would perhaps be advisable to consult the C.O. before taking a decision which will presumably have effect over a period of years in which we shall no longer be in charge. ■.A takx. , t(p J 'r Ot Co A\ hro C w J AcW (%, f A.C O prcjaS' /o i ./ V k 'W , 3939 5000 7/35 ~rhHo*-.£ r .2ZS/3i* i i 615 Government of India*, S DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIES MD-LABOlSU (Posts and Telegraphs Branch)' From To Sir, New Delhi, the &lt;^ ,K January,1936&lt; A.

S.W.l. 1 ADEN TELEPHONE SYSTEM. 14- kC'' I am directed to refer to India Office letter No. P.Z#3308/35, dated the 23rd May 1935, on the subject of the reduction of rates of rental for the Aden tele phone service and to say that the Government of India have now completed their review of the financial working of the system in the light of the actual expenditure incurred in rehabilitating it. 2. The results of the review are summarized in the enclosed statement marked •A*. This shows that the average annual expenditure in working and maintaining the system is Rs.44,617/-, while the revenue during each of the financial years 1933-34 and 1934-35 amounted to Rs.58,841/- and 8s.59,516/- respectively. As the revenue exceeds the expenditure there is a prima facie case for reducing the existing rental. Two alternatives have been considered, namely (1) making a reduction of rates for all classes of connections e.g., Direct Connections, extensions. Royal Air Force Private Branch exchange connections, Junction lines and Non-exchange connections or (2) reducing the rate for Direct connections only keeping the rents for others unchanged. it is estimated(3) ^ • -2 i estimated that a 15?5 reduction of the rate for all classes of connections would reduce the revenue of the system from &amp;.59,516/- (revenue for 1934-35) to Rs#50 ♦ 589/- f and as the annual recurring expendi ture involved is Rs.44,617/- only there would still he a small surplus. But this would still leave the rent of direct connections unduly high. The majority of the connections are direct connections whose existing rate of rental is ^.400/- per annum and a 15# reduction would give the subscribers relief to the extent of Rs.60/- per annum. There are also a number of extensions many of which might be converted to direct connections if the rate for the latter were lower than at present. The Government of India therefore consider^ it preferable to adopt the second alternative and make a somewhat larger reduction of rent for the direct connections, extending the benefit of the reduction to the two Junction lines to the Royal Air Force Private Branch exchange. (Junction lines to such exchanges are treated in India as direct exchange connections). 3. The changes they propose are shown below:- (1) Direct connection. Ex l fcUfl&amp;jL Rs. 400/- per annum for all connections with in a radial distance of 3 miles from the Exchange. (2) For each additional half mile or fraction thereof of radial dis tance from the Exchange. Ks. 50 /- per annum. Proposed* RSo 300/- per annum for all connec tions within a radial distance of 3 miles from the Exchange. Rs.40/- per annum.(3) for each Junction line be tween the jtioyal Air Force Pri vate Branch Exchange at Khormakser and the main Ex change. The existing rates of rental for extensions (internal or external), for the rtoyal Air Force Private Branch ex change connections and for the non-exchange installations would remain unchanged* The revenue of the system based on the number of connections during 1934-35 would then be Rs. 46,958/- against an annual recurring expenditure of Rs. 44,617/- as shown in statement •A*.

Attention is invited to the Government of India’s letter below. Tho Government of India are addressing the Secretary of State separately on the question of financial adjustments in connection with the transfer of buildings, cables, plant, etc. These considerations need not therefore detain us at this stage, although it may be noted that this Department had assumed that all that from the date of transfer H.M.G. will take over the control and management of the postal and telephone administration, the Government of India have put forward certain proposals for which it will be necessary to obtain the approval of H.M.G. They are as follows-.- (1) H.M.G. will take over the staff locally recruited, and will ensure to them their existing scales of pay and conditions of service in respect of leave, pension, etc. (2) H.M.G. will take over such members of the staff recruited in India who are willing to continue to serve in Aden after transfer. (3) In the case of members of the staff recruited in India who are not willing to continue to serve in Aden after separation, H.M.G. should involved in compulsory retirements, i.e. pensions, gratuities, etc. when it is impossible to provide employment for such members of the staff in India. buildings and plant would be transferred free of charge. 2 . On the assumption, which seems a reasonable one, e&gt; (a) pay the cost of the retransfer of U&lt;r the staff to India; (b) meet a proper proportion of the charges 5000 T 35 (4)/(4) The existing rates of pa S 1 frfl Q e between India and Aden, and vice versa (apparently an 4f* uneconomic rate) should continue. 3 . Prima facie, these proposals appear to be reasonable, though I am not sure whether H.M.G. can be expected to contribute towards pension or gratuities for servants of the Government of India for whom no employment can be found. However the proposals seem to be worthy of consideration and might be passed on to the colonial Office in due course. 4. For the moment it seems to be useless to pass on the proposals to the Colonial Office in their present form. We do not appear to have any information as to what the existing rates of pay of the postal and telephone staff are, nor do the Government of India give any indication of what they mean by a ’’proper proportion” of the charges involved in compulsory retirements. Unless any other Department can supply additional information on these points, it is submitted that we should refer the matter back to India and ask for more precise details. Draft letter is submitted accordingly. ^ L 3 -ST ** hcaAA.M. tfc- Ut &lt;a&lt;/aa&lt;iJL [ AAfoktCtuAj a I^J jr\ ymu £*** [}\ &lt;*^4) , L ftt r k UA fcuuf u/V bcAXfc CLtklAMf aJT ^ ^ ^ Secretary, S.&amp; G.Department, Accountant-General, Financial Secretary, ^ for information^ fh *+&gt;oy fa C. 6 . &lt;xXU^ fa^ru A*v j &lt;*u tdfci (a* /kAa+ZT OtCuA. clA' .

There are, I think, numerous precedents for grants of pension etc. on abolition of office or appointment, and the Government of India doubtless have these in mind in the present instance as regards the personnel recruited in India for whom no post can be found on their reversion to India. The proportion chargeable against the Imperial Government would presumably be the excess cost over the charge incurred in the event of normal retirement at the same date. There should be no difficulty in assessing this and in the case of a pensionary difference either the increase in amount would be recovered during the course of payment or it would be capitalized with a view to final liquidation of the liability at the outset. Subject to the remarks of the Financial Secretary, I am inclined to suggest the substitution in paragraph 2 (2) of a surmise on the above Presumably what is decided upon in the present connection will apply also to the case of personnel of other branches of the Aden administration, e.g. the Residency etc. Offices. i^haA«^no -furfhtrr- observational lines r ' 204 , 1956 ^ £ . f . 3 £&gt; 2621 6000 3 31Draft Paper p.z.saea/as Department H.R.

I am directed to address you on the subject cited above. 2. According to clause 5 of Section 288 of tne Government of India Act, 1935, the property of the Posts and Telegraphs Department in Aden, such as buildings, cables, wires, apparatus and plant &amp;c. will, from the date of separation, vest in Kis Majesty for the purposes of the Government of Aden (subject to any necessary financial adjustment in regard to which the Secretary of State will be addressed separately in due course), and all contracts made by the Department for the convey ance of mails or other services will continue in force as if they had been made by the Government of Aden. The Government of India presume that from that date Kis Majesty's Government will take over the control and management of the Postal and Telephone administration, including i2 including the Head Post Office at Aden Steamer Point and the Post Offices in Aden City and in the islands of Perim and Kamaran, and will make their own arrange ments for the supply of postage stamps, forms, etc. 3. The staff employed at Aden is partly recruited in India and partly locally recruited. His Majesty's Government will presumably take over all the staff locally recruited for service in Aden ana for offices under the Aden Head Post Office, and will ensure to them their existing scales of pay and conditions of service in respect of leave, pension, etc. In the case of the staff recruited in India now working in Aden, I am to suggest that such staff should also be taken over by His Majesty's Government if they are willing to serve in Aden after separation. Those who are unwilling so to serve will have to be compulsorily retired, except in so far as it is possible to provide appointments for them in India. I am to suggest that His Majesty's Government should meet a proper portion of the charges involved in each compulsory retirements i.e. pensions, gratuities, etc. The Government of India will endeavour to find appointments for as many as possible in India, but they suggest that the cost of the retransfer of staff to India should equitably be borne by His Majesty's X Government. a statement is enclosed giving particulars of the staff at present employed within the Jurisdiction of the Chief Commissioner of Aden.

My dear Acheson, As you know, Reilly will have completed five years as Resident at Aden next February, and in March 1937 he will be 55 years of age. You will no doubt agree that it is very desir able that Reilly should continue at Aden to see through the transfer from the control of the Government of India to that of the Colonial Office. He himself is not only willing but quite anxious to do so. 1 have mentioned the matter to Metcalfe, who personally agrees, and have discussed it informally with the Colonial Office. They are very desirous of retaining Reilly^ services for the transitional period before and after transfer. The Colonial Office, -therefore, would not only not object, but would be extremely pleased if Reilly, as an Indian service officer, could continue to hold his present post beyond the expiry of his five years, and until such time as transfer takes place. It is expected, I understand, that provincial autonomy will come into being about April 1937, and this would seem to be the most convenient date also fear the transfer of Aden. You will remember that Sir Samuel Hoare stated in the House of Commons on 9th April 1935 that 'it is our intention to bring the change into operation at or about the same time as provincial autonomy' 1 . If for any reason the date of provincial autonomy, and consequently of transfer, were retarded for a brief period beyond the end of March 1937, it might be necessary to relax the 55-year rule for a month or two in Reilly^ favour, but presumably this does not J.G.Acheson, Esq., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign &amp; Political Department.2 constitute a serious obstacle. On transfer taking place the Colonial Office would appoint Eeilly as the first Governor. He wouH thus be in charge both before and immediately after transfer to supervise the manifold practical arrangements, small and great, which have to be made to ensure a smooth transition. Gould you verykindly let me know as soon as possible whether you agree, so far as the Government of India are concerned, to Reilly remaining at Aden until the date of transfer? With reference to Metcalfe^ letter of 11th May and to the Government of India's express letter of 9th August, there will apparently be plenty of time to consider the practical details of the administrative change, if it does not take place till the date of provincial autonomy. The Colonial Office, 1 understand, contemplate consideration of these details, perhaps by a small committee, when Reilly is at home next summer and this would appear to be the best procedure. Meanwhile we can go on preparing the material for such consideration. In a letter to Fraser-Tytler of 25th August 1933 1 enclosed a note of an earlier tentative discussion. Perhaps you could let me have in due course the information which will be required from the Government of india on two points (Nos.2 and 4) in that note. Yours sincerely. (SD.) J.C.WALTONTel.
