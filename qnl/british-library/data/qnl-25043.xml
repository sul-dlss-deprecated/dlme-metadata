All parcels are liable to be opened for Customs examination, and their contents are subject to Customs duty according to the laws of the Coun try or Colony of destination. Such duty cannot be prepaid, but is collected from the addressee on delivery. In most Foreign Countries and British Colonies the articles which are not subject to Customs duty on importation are comparatively few. The Post Office can give no information as to the Customs tariff or procedure of particular countries; nor does it accept any responsibility for loss, delay, or charges arising from the Customs or sanitary regulations to which the contents of parcels are subject. In addition to Customs duty, a charge of 6d. per parcel for stamp duty, clearance, &amp;c., is levied on all dutiable parcels entering the Cape Colony, Natal, the British Central African Protectorate, and the Transvaal. This charge is increased to Is. in the case of those for Rhodesia and Is. 6d. in the Orange River Colony. In most European countries and some others a fee not exceeding 24 d..POSTAL INFORMATION — continued.

The Postage is charged at the rate of -Jd. per 2 oz.; if not prepaid, double the amount is charged on delivery ; if insufficiently prepaid, double the deficiency is charged. For each registered newspaper, whether singly or in a packet, one halfpenny; but a packet containing two or more is not chargeable with a higher rate than that on a book packet of the same weight,—viz., Jd. for every two ounces, or fraction of two ounces. COMPENSATION FOR THE LOSS OR DAMAGE OF UNREGISTERED INLAND PARCELS. 1. The Postmaster General is not legally liable to make good any claim arising out of the con veyance of a parcel sent by post, but he will accept liability under certain conditions. 2. If the parcel is registered, compensation will be given under the rules and regulations con tained in full under the heading of “ Registration and Compensation.” 3. If the parcel is not registered, the Post master General will accept liability up to £2, without payment of any fee beyond the postage, provided that (1.) The parcel is posted in the manner pre scribed for the posting of parcels by the regulations for the time being, and the postage prepaid. (2.) A certificate of posting (see par. 8, page 8 of Post Office Guide), is obtained at the time of posting from the officer accepting the parcel, and produced when required. This certificate must be filled up by the sender and handed to the officer of the Post Office, who will sign and return it to him. (3.) The parcel is properly packed and en closed in a reasonably strong case, wrapper, or cover, fastened in a manner calculated to preserve the contents from loss or damage in the post, and to prevent any tampering therewith. 4.

A parcel containing anything which, according to the regulations for the time being, may not be sent by the Inland Parcel Post. (2.) Any money sent in a parcel. (3.) Any watch or jewellery sent in a parcel, unless the parcel is registered by the sender. 5. No compensation will be given in respect of damage to— (1.) A parcel containing eggs, soft fruit, or any liquid or semi-liquid. (2.)

A parcel containing any perishable article, where the damage arises from natural decay, and the parcel is delivered in ordinary course of post. But in all such cases compensation will be given in respect of the loss of the parcel, or of any article contained therein. 6. In other repeats, the general conditions and regulations contained in paragraphs 11 to 25 under the heading of “Registration and Com pensation ” apply also to compensation in the case of ordinary Inland parcels. 7. The system of compensation up to £2 for ordinary Inland parcels does not apply to foreign and colonial parcels. REGISTRATION AND COMPENSATION. Compensation for Loss or Damage.

For this Service a Letter may be posted in any Letter Box, from which it will be collected by a Postman and be ex pressed on reaching the proper office. Service III.—By Special Delivery in advance of the ordinary Mail. By this means any person may make an arrangement with the local Postmaster to secure the immediate delivery of his own correspondence on its arrival. Service I. (Week-days only). Local. By Special Messenger all the way. In London Letters and Parcels for Express De livery in Town and Suburbs are accepted at 268 Post Offices (for List see Post Office Guide).

Entries start from 1 January and end at 31 December (some dates in between these dates do not have any entries). The entries are usually brief (although entries for some dates run over into the space for the entry for the next date).There are brief references to Hirtzel’s health, the weather, Hirtzel’s attendance at church services, and the birth of Hirtzel’s daughter Miriam (17 February, folio 39 verso). However, the diary entries largely concern John Morley (Viscount Morley of Blackburn, Secretary of State for India, referred to as ‘J.M.’ throughout). The entries mostly record the following:The views and opinions expressed by Morley on India and India Office business, including the Zakka Khel Expedition [or Zakha Khel Expedition, also known as the Bazar Valley Campaign] of 14 February to 1 March 1908, and the imprisonment of the Indian nationalist Bal Gangadhar Tilak (28 and 29 July, folio 85 verso).The views and opinions of Morley on domestic British politics, including the Sweated Industries Bill of 1908 (19 February, folio 39 verso) and on various individuals (as recorded by Hirtzel).Meetings between Morley and various individuals, including Winston Churchill (27 January, folio 33 verso; 14 February, folio 39 verso), the Prince of Wales (the future King George V) (10 February, folio 37 verso), King Edward VII (27 February, folio 43 recto), George Nathaniel Curzon (17 March, folio 47 verso; 26 and 27 March, folio 67 verso), Herbert Henry Asquith (17 March, folio 47 verso), James Keir Hardie (7 June, folio 73 recto), and Gopal Krishna Gokhale (3 December, folio 123 verso).Cabinet and Council meetings and other events attended by Morley.Conversations between Hirtzel and Morley.Morley’s health.Before the entry for 1 January on folio 25 verso, there are four lines in German, which quote the second verse of
                           O Gott, du frommer Gottby Johann Heermann.The volume itself is an
