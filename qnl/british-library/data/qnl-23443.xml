The Bahrain Government agreed (vide your telegram No. T/175 dated the 26th July, 1945) to pay Police Officers seconded for duty from the United Kingdom from the date of their departure for Bahrain and it is assumed that the arguments which led them to accept this obligation apply also to the return journey of these officers on the expiry of the term of their contract. If you agree, I suggest that the Bahrain Government should be ashed to accept responsibility of payment of the emoluments to the Officers concerned up to the date oJ their arrival in the United Kingdom. 4.
