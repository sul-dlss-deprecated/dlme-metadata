He left for Abu Dhubai this mroning and will be returning to Sharjah tomorrow. BritagentVM? V&gt; Confidential &amp; Personal. P2/22/49. ^ ' 2 ^ The Agency Sharjah. 13th March 1949. Will you please refer to my telegram no4Q5 of 13th Marc regarding the Continental shelf? 2. Lermitte tells me that the Rulers (other than Abu Dhabi), refuse to give him a letter agreeing that the Continental shelf lies inside their existing concessions. He says that they base their refusal upon my instructions that they should not commit themselves in this matter pending permission from H*M.G.(This may,of cousse, be only an excuse fordelaying any decision until they see which way the Abu Dhabi cat jumps) 3. I do, however, consider that if ve refuse them ^sign an entirely new concession, it might equally be claimed ^ that they have no right to give away an a ea which they have not yet claimed. 4. Possibly the most satisfactory solution from the point of view of H#M.G. would be for them to recognize the new area as lying inside the P#C#L# Concession, but before I tell the Shaikhs that they may do this, I sh uld like your a\iia ority. 5. I can see two possible snags in this: (a) The other competitors for the Sea Bed might be able to claim that the e w s deliberate collusion at a low level sn d that th y would no doubt allege unfair discrimination. Such an allegation might bear some weight if Veightman could show that his proposed company would be to a grea/ter extent British than is P.C#L# (b) As Abu Dhabi are determined upon arbitration txxx and might well win their case, the minor Shaikhs, who are mainly very much dependent upon XXK#M#G. for friendly advice in their dealings wlt-h outside inte ests , would possibly fool that we had allowed them to be misled, whilst the more powerful Abu Dhabi had got away with a fat concession.We might ih ereby somewhat diminish our prestige. 5. I have been careful to avoid passing any opinion as to the rights and wrongs of the case and have confined myself to saying that there is some doubt as to the legal position of the new areas and that this question can only be resolved by them and the Company. H.M^G’s only possible participation in the affair would be if the P.R # were to be asked to find an arbiter under the terms of the Ccncession. 6. The question as to whether the Rulers a.e entitled to give Lermitte the letter for which he asks , in advance of the issue of proclamations by them appears to be a very nice point upon which I should be grateful for your ins tru cti ons. . 7. Regarding the po/i^bleAbu Dhabi Arbitration, iV' would appear that this ^huuld be carried out as soon as possib -le. Lermitte still hopes to talk the Shaikh round to giving the whole area to P.C.L. but I cannot conceive of this ever happening, however long he argues with him, since Veightman appears to have well and truly whetted the Abu Dhabi appetite. The Shaikh,on the other hand, seems to hope to sign up with Weightman in the near future and to leave it to the two companies to fight it out, which wouldsave him expense, worry and unpleasantness. He would also be assure^ of the best legal advice being sought by Weightman. 8. Unless Weightman is kept away, therefore, this unfortunate business will only become more and more complicated and tempers will become so strained that the possibility of a prompt and amicable s lution will entirely disappear.

Folio ing your instructions, I left for Abu Dhabi, arriving at 1.30 p.m. on 5th April. I there saw Shaikhs Shakhbut, Hazza and Khalid. The ruler said that he was determined to sign an agreement with Sir Hugh heightman and that he could not afford to wait any longer: his country s poo , for ten years or so, he had had a concession with P.D.T.C. and had not received a drop of water let alone oil frojn them and he therefore could not refuse any offer which Weightman might make. He ac fitted having fully understood from me on 6th March (my letterjdfc P2/9/49 refers) that he should not commit himself without the consent of H.M.G. 3* I replied that I could only regard any signature by him him as a breach of good faith if it were to be given in advance of oUr permission, and reminded him that such a concession might well be declared invalid by K#M#G# I also stressed the fact that H.M.G. were not asking * * him to renounce a concession , but to wait like the other Gulf Rulers^, until permission was given. 4. He eventually said that he would await H.K.G s permission, but asked me particularly to represent to you his extreme anxiety to sign. This I promisd to do. 5. ^ Immediately after seeing the Ruler, I went to Abu Dhabi Guest House and informed Weightman of the action which I had taken. 6. I would suggest that the only way of ensuring that Shaikh Shahhbu£ does not go back on his word a second time / is to keep Weightman away from Abu Dhabi until he has permission to obtain a concession. I feel it to be intolerable that a distinguished public servant in retirement should have facilities for visiting for visiting an area for which he was formerly responsible and there , trading upon the fact that he is known and respect -ed , blatantly encourage the Ruler to break faith with H.M.G. / V&lt; cL t/ /»&gt; io G0&gt;&lt; 4 * C.J.

The aircraft landed in the creek a little West of the town. On 11th, they returned to Sharjah* leaving for Bahrain on the next day. k 3. Weightman informed me that Shaikh Shakhbut wolud not commit himself in the absence of his brothers, and asked for a letter to be given him which he could show them on their return from the interior • This was given. He said that in the absence of permission for Shakhbut to go ahead with an agreement, he was seeking an option. 4. Weightman seemed keen that the R.A. should be taken into our confidence over this matter* in fact, although I had warned him of this difficulty, he started to discuss the question in Jasin^s presence, and 1 had to shut him up until I could get rid of Jasim. I said that pending instructions from you, Jasim would not handle t these papers,but that I would refer to you about it.My own view is that there can be no reason for taking him into our confidence at the present stage. 5 . Weightraan showed great interest in Buraimi, and I confined myself to answering his questions on very general lines and without telling him anything about Bird’s activities. He plans to return in a months time, or sooner.if Shakhbut so desires. I promised to relay any telegrams which Shakhbut might send to the Agency^. « 7.

Will you please refer to your telegram no 20 of 4 th Ma*ch regarding Sea bed oil. On 5th March, I ssv Veightman and had a short discussion vith him and his American colleague. I promised to arrange transportfes far as possible, warning them that this would prove difficult owing to the fact that I also was providing vehicles for a party of surveyors going to Muscat, and that this would cause a shortage of good vehicles locally. 3. Weightman informed me that whilst Superior Oil Co was American and was registered in Los Angeles, the proposed company which wou -Id exploit any possible concession would have a British element (Central Mining) vtfiose degree of participation would depend on the extent of Dollar expenditure necessary for the development of the oil field. The larger the dollar expenditure of the prop Y^sed company, the greater the American share in it. 4. On 6th and 7th March, I was in Abu Dhabi where I spoke to the Ruler alone on the lines already indicated by you in your unnumbered manuscript letter of 3rd March.(Your suggestion that I should prepare a ’set piece}with the Aid of a dictionary, proved most helpful, and I am reasonably happy that Shakhbut got a fair picture of the position). He was characteristically reasonable about the whole matter and seemed to understand the somewhat delicate position.I think he is sufficiently afraid of extravag-nt claims by Qatar or others'xo betray any confidences. He is also on his best behaviour now 'that the border with Dubai is under arbitration. ^ j 5. He seemed anxious lest his refusal tb give Weightman a de• ini -te answer on 10 March might fee cause him to sheer off ' never to return. I assured him that the proposed discussions of 10th March would not be the only ones, that Weightman would understand position and would no doubt be willing to return when K.M.G. had clarified the situation regarding extension of- jurisdiction. He seemed fairly happy about this eventually and expressed a wish to see Bertram Thomas at some future time. I promised to p^ss this 6.

Secret. (40/27/48) Persian Gulf Residency Bahrain* / j i \ 20th October, 1948. H . Will you please refer to correspondence ending with my P.L. No. B/221 (86/62) - K/100 (86/62) - M/80 (86/62) of the 8th July, about the continental shelf. 2. Following the development of a technique whereby the oil deposits lying beneath the bed of the sea may be exploited, the Government of the United States in 1946 made a formal proclamation of jurisdiction over the natural resources of the continental shelf - of the United States. While our views and those of the United States, have generally been easily reconciled in matters concerning limits of oil concessions on land, according to established international practice, the introduct ion of an entirely new element into the whole conception of territorial and maritime right?, has rendered essential a clearer definition of national jurisdiction with regard to the seabed in those parts of the world in which national interests, particularly those of the United Kingdom and United States, might tend to conflict. Such areas are the West Indies and the Persian Gulf. 3. It has therefore been decided by Governments of United Kingdom and United States that a definition in general terms of the jurisdiction over the continental shelf claimed by the various Persian Gulf states should be made at an early opportun ity in order to place on a regular and agreed basis any future sea-bed drilling which may be undertaken in the near future by Oil Companies operating in the Persian Gulf, and to prevent premature claims to the sea-bed off the shore of the Persian Gulf States by other powers. 4. It has been agreed by ourselves and the United States that in the near future, the Governments of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms and of the Sultanate of Muscat should be given copies of a draft declaration JcJu on the lines of that at Appendix 'A* 1 , with the request that they should study them but treat them as strictly confidential for a period of time not exceeding about three weeks in order to allow time for all rulers to be informed of the action which we are proposing to take, and in order to give the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, time to warn the Iraq and Persian Governments of the action which they have taken and the reason for it. After the expiry of this period, the termination of which will be notified to all rulers (during which time, the Iraq and Persian Governments will have been • approached), the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms and Muscat will be at liberty to publish the prodlamation if they so desire. 6. The exact form of the declaration is not yet final, but it is expected to be similar to that attached. The final text will be sent to you when received from the Foreign Office, together with final instructions regarding date of / communication (2 copies) .J. Peliy, Esq., O.B.E Political Agent, Bahrain^ %- 2 /-v communication to the Shaikhs or the Sultan. 6. You will note that whilst the ’'Median Line' may be fairly easily determined, there has been no hard and fast definition of the boundaries between the individual states on the Western and Southern sides of the Persian Gulf; these, like the land frontier, remaining to be determined at a later date in many cases. 7. In the case of Muscat, the present declaration takes into consideration only that part of Muscat territory which lies in the Persian Gulf, as opposed to the Gulf of Oman, and does not prejudice the Sultan's right in the sea-bed of the Gulf of Oman or the Arabian Sea. The United States' State Department may possibly make a separate approach to the Sultan, in addition to that made by the Political Agent, Muscat, by virtue of the long standing treaty relations of Muscat and the United States, or, alternatively may request us to inform the Sultan that our own approach is made in their name also. Instructions on this point are being sought from the Foreign Office. 8. If there is any point in this letter or its enclosure which appears to you to require clarification, please inform me as soon as possible, if necessary by telegram.vf © AP P . eQ . d J. x . i , i , ^L» ~ FORM OF DRAFT DECLAI'IQN REGARDING o^A-BED oA depqsitsT 'Whereas it has become technically possible to utilize the natural resources of the sea-bed and subsoil beneath the shallow seas, Whereas it is desirable in the interests of protection, conservation, and orderly development that the exploitation of such resources should be properly controlled, Whereas it is just that the sea-bed and subsoil extending to a reasonable distance from the coasts should appertain to and be controlled by the maritime state to which it is adjacent, Whereas the right of the maritime state to exercise its control over the natural resources of the sea-bed and subsoil adjacent to its coasts has been established in international practice by the action of other states, Now therefore, we the • (Shaikh, Sultan etc.) of in pursuance of all the powers enabled us in that behalf, are pleased to proclaim, and &lt;•11 is hereby proclaimed, as follows - 1.
