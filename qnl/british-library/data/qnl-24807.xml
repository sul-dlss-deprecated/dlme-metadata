Mr. Kafil-ud-Din ^hmau Executive Lnginner is at Lraaent drawiiig is. bQ/~ per mensea ae Custome Coaapenaatory lilo^ancs and 100/-* as kotor Car /illoivance. Neither allojanoe is proving adequate. ^ V \^Ni dince he arrived at Buanire, he has paid &amp;. 2,310/- L on three articles alone (i.e. Motor Car fe. i f bd2/-.

He is If ^ Gazetted Officer and a member of one of the All India ik, K Services and I consider that he should be granted the same Customs Compensatory allowance as the Residency aur *eon Bushire. T.A % 3. Ae regards the Motor Car Allowance the Government of India are aware tnat in Bushire there are no r: al contractors in the sensu ot the word as used in Indian Contractors in Busoire aro nothing mori than supervising miatriea who iiava had no engineering si or technical training. They have no plant in the way of building equipment of tools and ik l hair work lias to be supervised at every stage by the executive ai^ineer and his subordinates, apart from an acute shortage of staff duri/g the last ttires years, the new technical staff recruited by the Government of India for the Persian Gulf Independent duo-Division are not, with one exception, fully trained , nd experienced men. This ms resulted in the Axecuti#© Engineer, Slaving to supervise personally oven the must petty repairs and works and make frequent journeys by car often several timou a day. The buildings of this Residency aro scattered over an arsa o? 14 square miles and the existing iotor Car allowance is in**dul‘ficient to prevent Mr. Anmad from beiiig heavily out oi ocKet. 4. 1 therefore, rscommand that Ilia Customs Cocii ensatory allow«uice be increased from fe« 50/- to k. 100/- and is Motor Car Allowance Ax from ik. 100/- to &amp;. 150/- per mensem «fith eilect from the 1st January 1945. since Mr. Ahmad has already been put to considerable financial loss.
