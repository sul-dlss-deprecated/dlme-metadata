FOKEIGH OFFICE,S . W. 1. (E 6451/98/91) 23rd Jecember 1932. Sir f With reference to your notes Hos.13d9 of the 24th September and 1412 of the 4th October, regarding certain facilities desired for Aircraft of the Royal Dutch Air Transport Company (K.L.M.) in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to inform you that the request of the Netherlands Government for the regularisat ion of the position as regards Netherlands aircraft flying over Gwadur and landing tnere was duly forwarded to the competent British authorities for transmission to the Sultan of Muscat. I hope to be able to inform you in the near future of the reply returned by His Highness. 2. I understand that since the date of your notes under reference, the Netherlands Government have obtained from the Persian Government renewed permission to fly along the Persian coast of the Gulf. In these circumstances, I have the honour to enquire of you whether the Netherlands Government wish any longe to pursue the question of facilities along the Arab coast of the Gulf and still desire application for facilities to be made on their behalf to the Shaikh of Bahrain, as requested in your note of the 24th September. 3. It would not in any case, I fear, be possible to afford the Royal Dutch Air Transport Company facilities at Yas Island. The aerodrome there which is not more than an emergency landing ground on the military air xst route, is not used by Imperial Airways. 4. The aerodrome at Kuwait has also, as a general rule , been closed to civil aircraft,and has not hitherto been a regular stopping-place/ cheer R. de Marees van Swinderen, G.C.V.O., etc. etc etc- 2 - stopping-place for the Imperial Airways machines. 't exists primarily for the protection of the Shaikhdom and any facilities granted there to civil aviation must in any case be subject to its prior and, if necessary, exclusive use for this purpose. It lias been recently proposed, at the request of the Shaikh, that Imperial Airways should make experimental visits to Kuwait over a certain period, but these trials are still in their initial stages and the expediency of such visits has yet to be proved. In the present conditions therefore this aerodrome could not be made available for general use by commercial aircrait .

Sir, • :/ ith reference to Foreign Office letter No. E 6451/98/91 of the 29th December, 1932, regarding the question of the possible grant of facilities for Netherlands aircraft along the Arabian coast of the Persian u-ulf, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, the accompanying copy of a further note from the Netherlands Minister, from which it will be seen that the Royal Dutch Air Transport Company still desire to obtain the facilities in question. 2. In view of the repetition of this request, Sir John Simon considers that, subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare, an application on behalf of the Netherlands Government should now be made to the Shaikh of Bahrain in accordance with the offer made in paragraph 8 of the note df the 31st August to the Netherlands Minister, a copy of which was sent to the India Office under cover of Foreign Office letter No. E 4359/ 3307/65 of the 2nd September. 3. Sir John Simon further suggests that an endeavour should be made to expedite the reply of the Sultan of Muscat to the application regarding the regularisation of the use of Gwadur by Netherlands aircraft which the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed in the telegram, a copy of which was enclosed in India Office letter No.P.2.6962/32 of the 23rd December, to make on behalf of the Netherlands Government to His Highness. The Under-Secretary of State, India Office. 4/4 - 2 - In these circumstances I am to suggest that the Political Resident should be instructed by telegram to endeavour to secure the formal consent of the Shaikh of Bahrain to the grant of general facilities for the aircraft of the Royal Dutch Air Transport Company, similar to those which will be enjoyed by Imperial Airways Limited, and to endeavour to obtain an early reply both from the Shaikh and from the Sultan of Muscat. 5* I am to request that the Secretary of State may be fur nished with the views of Sir Samuel Hoare at an early date, in order that a reply may be returned without delay to Moasieur de Marees van Swinderen. 6 .

I have the honour in accordance tfith instructions received to inform you that nothwithstanding that there is every appearance that the Persian Government will grant the permission to fly along the Persian coast of the Persian Gulf to each aeroplane separately the Dutch Air Transport Company would greatly appreciate if they coult obtain the facilities along the Arab coast and to use the same aerodromes as Imperial Airways as requested in my note of 24th September last No. 1359. The measure taken a few weeks ago by the Persian Government regarding customs examination causes so much hindrance to the regular air service between Amsterdam and Batavia that the desirability and even the necessity could present themselves to transfer the service to the Arab Coast. I should be most grateful if you would be good enough to furnish me with a reply to the present note at your earliest convenience and have the honour etc., (Sgd.) R de Marees van Swinderen.

( E 506/11/91) 11th. March, 1933. IMPORTAHT . My dear Gilbert, With reference to your official letter P#2.231/33 of the 25th January, enclosing a copy of the draft agreement between Imperial Airways and the Shaikh of Bahrain, I sendyou 9 as arranged l by telephone, a written statement of our views, in order that, as you have suggested, the matter may be discussed at an inter departmental meeting. We agree with you that it will be necessary as a first step to have such a meeting without a representative of Imperial Airways. 2* In the first place, there is one general point which interests us, namely that the agreement should be in line with the International Air navigation Convention of 1919 and should allow no undue discrimiriation against foreign aircraft. This raises the general question of the position of Bahrain in respect of international conventions. At the moment we are sitting on the fence: on the one hand, Bahrain is not a British protected State, in the sense that the Malay States, for instance, are; so the Air Convention cannot be said to apply already to Bahrain under Article 40. On the other hand, it seems doubtful whether we should be prepared to regard Bahrain as sufficiently independent to accede to the Convention as a separate State under Article 41. (For convenience of reference, I attach copies of this and other texts referred to in this letter). I understand that the India Office consider that the present rather vague position of the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms in respect of inter national/ J. G. Laithwaite, Esqinternational conventions should be maintained, if possible, and though I am personally very doubtful as to how long it will be possible to go on without defining the situation more clearly, we do not want - at any rate for the moment - to dissent from this view. But obviously it will only increase the risk of the Butch or others raising the question of Bahrain’s being or becoming a party to the Air Convention if Bahrain makes an agreement with Imperial Airways which is not in harmony with its provisions. 3. On the same general ground we feel strongly that it would be unwise to allow Bahrain to make any agreement with Imperial Airways which involved undue discrimination against foreign aircraft. In addition, we know that the Butch contemplate using Bahrain for their air services, and we have already told the Uetheelands Minister (in paragraph 8 of our note of the 31st August,1932: copies to India Office and Air Ministry in Foreign Office letter E 4359/3307/65 of the 2nd September) that we anticipate that Bahrain will have no objec tion to Netherlands aircraft enjoying there facilities similar to those granted to Imperial Airways. We think therefore that it is necessary to consider whether the draft agreement with Imperial Airways - more particularly Article 15 and your suggestions regarding Article 16 - squares with the relevant provisions - e.g., Article 24 - of the International Air Convention, and, if not, what changes are necessary. We also think that, both on general grounds and in view of what we have said to the Butch, it would be a mistake to allow the Bahrain Government to give Imperial Airways a specially privileged position, about which the Butch or other foreign companies could subsequently eomplain with some show of justification, even if it were possible for the Bahrain Government to do so without running directly counter to the Air Convention.3 °/ -3- 4# There are also one or two points which we should like to raise on the draft itself. They are as follows: Preamble : We think that it would be unneeessary and i unwise to insert, as you suggest, the words 'with the approval of His Majesty’s G-overnment’ ? . To do so might lay us open to the accusation of interference with the independence of Bahrain to an extent not warranted by the treaty position; and the addition of these words does not in itself confer us any power of control, which none the less can in practice be satisfactorily exercised through the Political Resident. Article 3 : It is not clear whether the choice of aerodromes is to be left to the Company throughout the duration of the agreement or whether at some moment they are to take a definite decision between the two. The wording of Article 3 seems to support the first theory, the opening words of Article 15 rather support the second. Article 4 and others : 'Aircraft': It is not clear throughout whether reference is being made to aircraft of the h Company or ( in view of the Company being managers of the aerodrome} to all aircraft. ti 6: We concur in the amendment proposed in your l covering letter. Articles j3..ana 9: Certain provisions with regard to the k, exemption of aircraft in transit,etc.,from customs duties have been inserted in the bilateral air navigation conventions which ^ we have concluded with other countries. At the same time, it is worth noting that the Government of the Sudan, in allowing Italian air transport companies to use their territories for air ; services at the recommendation of His Majesty's Government in the : „ 8 , United Kingdom under the provisions of the Anglo-ltalian Conven- tioR of Ma y 16 &gt; 1931 &gt; respecting Air Transport Services, only did-4- so with the reservation that Italian companies would not be entitled in the Sudan to customs exemption for spare parts, fuel and oil carried and used on their aircraft, even though this reservation was qualified by a statement that Italian companies would not receive less favourable treatment as to customs duties than British or Egyptian companies. The budan Government objected, I believe, to customs exemptions on much the same ground as that now advanced by Bahrain, and we agree with the India Office that it would be reasonable that the customs concession should be limited to the petrol and oil imported for refuelling. Articles 12 and 15 ; We concur in the India Office views• Article 15 1 (a) line 2; !&lt; the aerodromes that may be used by civil aircraftThe general position with regard to aerodromes is not clear (see my remarks under Article 3 abovej and, as the agreement is to last for eleven years, this phrase might with advantage be made more precise. At present it might apparently include the Royal Air Force aerodrome. ihe remainder of the Article and the various proposals regarding Article 16 require examination in the light of the views expressed in paragraphs 2 and 3 above. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Shelmerdine in tiie letter of which I enclose a copy. Yours ever, (Sgd.)

We had been awaiting the Air Ministry’s observations, but we now understand from Laithwaite that you do not pro pose to write until an interdepartmental meeting has been held to discuss the matter.

In view of the nature of these points it will evidently be impossible to have a representative of Imperial Airways present at the proposed meeting, as I believe Betram had at one time suggested to Laithwaite; and the necessary consultation with Imperial Airways will therefore have to take place at a later stage.

Copy. Enclosure in Air Ministry covering letter, Ho.S.31454/S.6, dated 13th March 1933. Ho. S.31454/S.6. SECRET. AIR MINISTRY. 13th March, 1933. Sir, I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to Foreign Office letter of the 1st March, E.1009/11/91 on the subject of the renewed application by the Netherlands Minister for facilities for the Royal Dutch Air Transport Company along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf and in reply am to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that subject to what is stated below they concur in his view that an application on behalf of the Netherlands Government should now be made to the Shaikh of Bahrain and that efforts should be made to hasten a reply from the Sultan of Muscat regarding regularisation of the use of Gwadur by Netherlands aircraft. It appears to the Council, however, that as Monsieur de Marees van Swinderen has now applied for facilities along the Arab Coast and for the use of the same aerodromes as Imperial Airways, it is probable that the application relates not only to Bahrain and Gwadur but also to Kuwait and possibly to Yas Island and .ohargah. Having regard to the fact that Imperial Airways have now been operating over this route for some months, it may be difficult to maintain the attitude taken in paragraph 9 of the reply sent to the Netherlands Minister on the 31st August last. The Council would accordingly be glad to learn whether Sir John Simon is content for the present to avoid mentioning Kuwait and the intermediate stage between Bahrain and Gwadur. Another point to which the Council desire to refer is the need/ The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, Downing street, S.W.l,- 2 - iqoj A : n fcS i ! &gt; need for the Royal Butch Air Transport Company to consult Imperial Airways as to the conditions under which they would make use of the facilities which have been provided for the latter Company. Imperial Airways have in the past suffered from the Dutch Air Line being willing to take full advantage of the facilities provided on the Persian Coast route by the British Government and Imperial Airways themselves but shewing no disposition to make adequate payment for their use. Por example, the Council understand that the practice of the Dutch Company is to appoint a native local agent of no standing in order to evade payment to Imperial Airways of agency fees. In order to safeguard the interests of Imperial Airways, the Council consider that permission to use the facilities provided on the Arab Coast route should be subject to satis factory arrangements being made between the two Companies.

His Highness has, however, stated that he wishes that a further application be made to him if the Royal Dutch Air Transport Company desire permission for weekly flights and landings at Gwadur. 2. Since I understand from your note, Ho. 222 of the 21st February and previous correspondence on this subject, that the Company do in fact desire permission for regular flights and landings at Gwadur, the local British authorities are being- instructed to make on behalf of the Netherlands Government, xwme. immediate application to the Sultan for such permission. 3. The permission of the Bhaikh of Bahrain is also being sought for the aircraft of the Company to make regular flights over, and landings on his territory. 4. Both the Sultan of Muscat and the Shaikh of Bahrain are at present considering the question of the financial and other general conditions to be attached to permission for the use of their territory by foreign aircraft, i shall be glad to give you further information on this point as soon as the necessary/ R. de Marees van Swinderen, G.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc.-2 necessary dec is ions have been reached.

The extraordinary delay in establishing our position has lost us our golden opportunity. Having lost it, I agree that the Bahrain State Aerodrome is the line that we should adopt ( indeed there are advantages in it)• Bahrain has no money and I would beg you to urge His Majesty 1 s Government with all the force at your command to provide the money at once and so avoid getting foreign capital into the Air route, as has been done in the Oil Industry.

His Highness, whose prolonged ab^sence in a distant part of his Sultanate has made it impossible to obtain an earlier reply from him, is willing in principle to grant permission for the aircraft of the Company to make regular flights over and landings on his territory at Gwadur. ^he Shaikh of Bahrain has also expressed similar willingness in principle in regard to flights over and. landings at Bahrain. 3. Both rulers, however, have under consideration the technical and financial conditions on which foreign aviation companies may use their territories. Subject to these conditions, which will be communicated to you as soon as they are received, the Sultan and the Shaikh will be prepared to permit regular landings by the Company in the territories concerned. I regret, however, that a certain delay is inevitable, since His Highness is not expected to return to Muscat until the middle of December.

It is unfortunate that Monsieur da Bontaigu succeeded in avoiding the regulations which were being applied at Baghdad by obtaining a visa from the British Consular Officer at Basrah.

It will be seen from the correspondence that M. de Montaigu applied to the Embassy for permission to fly to Bahrain and was informed that special permission for the flight would have to be obtained from the Political Authorities in the Gulf. In spite of this M.de Montaigu proceeded to Basrah, and concealing the fact from the Acting Consul there that he was travelling to Bahrain in a private plane, procured a visa for that place ’’under false pretences”.

In paragraph 2 of your despatch you raised the question of the visa supplied to Mr. de Montaigu by His Majesty 1 s Consulate, Basrah. It has been ascertained from Mr. Hendry, who was at that time in charge of that Consulate, that M e Montaigu did, in fact, conceal from him that he intended to proceed to Bahrain by air. 3. I note that the visa rules framed by M r .Consul Selous, in collabaration with a previous Political Agent, were intended to facilitate travel between Bahrain and Basrah of genuine Bahraini and Basrah merchants only. There is, however, no clear indication of this intention in the rules, which might, I consider be re-drafted with advantage; and I trust that you will agree that no blame attaches to the ! Acting Consul, Mr. Hendry, who was not aware of any circum stances making the grant of a visa undesirable. 4. I fully realize the necessity for authorization in the case of flights to Bahrain, and I would suggest that If this particular incident is to be pursued further, the best course would be for the India Office to take up the /matter e Honourable the B 0 iptical Resident in the Persian G u if f Bushire.11 ® 2 . matter in London with the ^raq Petroleum Company, of -which M de Montaigu is a director.

If €&gt; Mis Majesty’s Embassy present their compliments to the Ministry of Foreign affairs and have the honour to inform them that on October S2nd last Monsieur de -^ontaigu, a French national, arrived at Bahrain from Iraq, without authorization, in his private aeroplane. 2. This gentleman had been provided by the Customs authorities at Bhaibah air port w r ith an Air Clearance Document, the original of which is enclosed herein, and which is endorsed ’Bahrain direct’. As the Ministry are aware, the flight of private aeroplanes over the territory of Bahrain is not permitted, and His Majesty’s Embassy would be glad to learn the circumstances in vdiich the authorities at Shaibah air port furnished Monsieur de Montaigu with the document in question. His Majesty’s Embassy avail themselves of this opportunity to renew the expression of their highest consideration. British Embassy, Baghdad, 10th December 1934.No:259-39/19. 2nd February 1935. sir, ?vith reference to your despatch No:275/13/34 of the 28th December 4§34 last concerning the circumstances of M. de Montaigu^ visit to Bahrain, I have the honour to inform ^four Excellency that in view of Hendry T s explanation I agree that no blame attaches to him in the matter. 2. With regard to the amendment of the visa rules referred to in paragraph 3 of your despatch, I suggest that Colonel Loch and Mr. Hurst might collaborate in producing such an amendment for our .joint approval. I am instructing Colonel Loch to this effect, and if you see no objection perhaps you would be good enough to issue similar instructions to Mr. Hurst. 3. It w'ould appear that the main points requiring more precise definition are the categories of applicants who may be granted visas without reference. 4. I suggest that it would be advisable to refer applications from all foreigners except male British subjects, Irani, Kuwaiti, Nejdi merchants or others from the Arab Littoral. 5. In addition to the persons covered by paragraph 5 of the present Visa Rules referred to in paragraph 2 above private aviators should also be refused visas. With reference to the last paragraph of Your Excellency^ letter I enclose a copy of a despatch which I am addressing to the India Office. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant.

In this connection please see Muscat Civil Air Agreement, paragraph II. 1 (ii). (2) I am not quite clear whether it is intended that permission shall be given to the iC.L.M. to fly over the Arabian territories of the Sultan. If not, their machines after leaving Bahrain will have to fly round the tip of the Has Musandum peninsula, thus considerably increasing the length of their flight to Gwadur, which is already a very long one, and will be entirely over the sea, in land machines. It may be that the K.L.M., by permission of the Iranian Govern ment, intend to continue using Jask; but even so, if they have to fly round the peninsula and not across it, the length of their flight will be appreciably increased. If permission is granted to the K.L.M. to fly over the peninsula, they will necessarily have to be given permission to fly over the Trucial Coast, since it is only the extreme tip of the penin sula which belongs to Muscat, and further South there is a corridor independent of Muscat, running from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman. If it is intended to permit the K.L.M. to fly over the Trucial Coast and the Arabian territories of the Sultan, then for authorization for the latter area, please see Muscat Civil Air Agreement paragraph II. 1 (i).

Dear Brenan, Regarding the communication to be made to the Netherlands Legation on the subject of the request of the K.L.M. to use Sharjah Aerodrome. With reference to your letter of the 14th instant (E.5309/377/91) we agree with your draft subject to two small observations. At the end of paragraph 3, would it not be as well to omit the words after 'aerodrome*? The remark that the place is well off the route normally followed by the Company’s aircraft, applies equally to Bahrain tor which we have issued a permit. We do not, however, press this point. At the end of paragraph4 we do not quite like your expressiori'complying with certain special conditions of construction etc.” we suggest that the last sentence of this paragraph might perhaps run 'it would be necessary to require that the aircraft employed on the service should possess certain technical characteristics which are insisted upon in the case of the aircraft of Imperial Airways Limited operating over this route'.

I have the honour to invite a reference to your note No. / 448 of the 23rd March last, in which you stated that the Royal Dutch Air Lines (K.L.M.) had approached His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire with a view to obtaining permission to fly over Muscat and Bahrain, and to use the aerodromes at Gwadur and Muharraq for emergency purposes, and that the Company were anxious to obtain permission to use Sharjah aerodrome also for the same object. 2. As regards flights over Muscat and Bahrain, and the use of the aerodromes at Gwadur and Muharraq* 1 have the honour to inform you that His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire forwarded to the Royal Dutch Air Lines on the 9th May last special authorizations granted to them for this purpose by His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman and by His Excellency the Shaixh of Bahrain respectively. ^— 3- As regards landings at Sharjah aerodrome (which would presumably also involve flights along the Trucial Coast) His Majesty’s Government do not clearly appreciate the circumstances in which the Company anticipate the necessity for the possible use of the aerodrome, since the place is well off the route normally followed by the Company’s air liners. 4. I should explain that apart from the fact that the agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Shaikh of Sharjah restricts landings to aircraft of Imperial Airways and that it would therfore be necessary to negotiate a new agreement before other aircraft could use the aerodrome, the accommodation at the fort and rest house at Sharjah barely suffices/ e er R.de Marees van Swinaeren,GCVO., etc.. etc..etc. No .E 5893/377/91. Sir, ''Hr , r i2 - auffices for the needs of the existing services, and would thus have to be considerably extended before facilities could be contemplated for other aircraft, more particularly since, British aircraft could scarcely be restricted to the aircraft of Royal Dutch Air Lines. Moreover, in order to reduce as far as possible the likelihood of forced landings, with the possibility of consequent unfortunate incidents in this un civilised territory, it would be necessary to require that the aircraft employed on the service should possess certain technical characteristics which are insisted upon in the case of aircraft of Imperial Airways Limited operating over this route. 5. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government would not feel justified in making such arrangements solely to provide for a hypothetical situation which does not seem likely to arise so long as the Royal Dutch Air Lines enjoy facilities for flight along the Persian side of the Persian Gulf. If, however, such facilities should be withdrawn from the Royal Dutch Air Lines, His Majesty’s Government would naturally be prepared to reconsider the question. as you will appreciate, facilities granted to other than I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration, Sir, Your obedient servant.

Dalrymple Belerave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, To «' His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to draw your attention to the fact that the air liner of the Royal Dutch Air Transport Company which landed on the Muharraq aerodrome on Saturday November 28, 1936, did so without previous notification of time of intended arrival and departure thus contravening regulation No. 11 of Air Navigation Regulations for Civil Aircraft of the Civil Air Agreement entered into by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Al- Khalifah and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom on 6th June 1934.

Shortly afterwards, about 15.00 hours, she alighted at the Muharraq landing ground. The pilot. Captain Moll, informed me on the telephone that he had been driven to cross over to the Arabian coast by a thunder storm on the Persian coast after leaving Jask and that he had had to come to Bahrain as he was short of petrol (he took some 350 litres). I said that his aeroplane was not one of those for which permission to land had been granted (see my Express letter No.C/87 of 19th February 1936), but that now I knew that it was the DutchDutch air mail, I would give orders to enable her to re-fuel as soon as possible* He re-fuelled and left in a very short time. 4. In addition to the point that the aeroplane is not one of the eight for which authorisation for flight within the limits of Bahrain and landing at the Muharreq landing ground had been given, the Bahrain Government have made a -formal protest against the aeroplane having landed with .... V , previous notification of the time of intended arrival and ,4 departure required by Regulation 11 of the Air Navigation Regulations. v,\M^ 5. I do not attach importance (nor I think do the Bahrain Government) to the contravention of Rule 11 in the special circumstances of the case, as the landing was in an emergency and the aeroplane gave what notice it could. From the local point of view, however, I think that the attention of the Company might be drawn to the fact that the aeroplane was not one of those for which an authorization had been obtained, but that nevertheless the Bahrain Government had, as a matter of friendliness, permitted it to re-fuel and proceed at once.

I would, however, suggest (a) that the Station Superintendent might be instructed in such event to refuse re-fuelling facilities till he had received authority in writing from the Residency Agent (or in his absence authority by telegram from me) and (b) that the Residency instructed not to 8 ra»t this authority till the pilot had informed him in writing of the cause of his landing and asked permission to proceed.
