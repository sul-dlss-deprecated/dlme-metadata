B A ROD A, December \Zth, 1874. [ Private. ] My Lord, As desired by your Lordship, I submit a brief unofficial resume of the condition of affairs I find here. The Gaekwar is alarmed, and, like his Minister, appreciates the significance of your khureeta and my appointment. His reply to the khureeta quite commits him, if not to a request for intervention, at least to an assent to be bound by your Excellency's advice. The reply was followed by a series of letters drawn up after a long inter view between the Minister and myself, in which His Highness promises to accede to all the requirements of the instructions of 25th July. He desires further that the enquiries into the complaints of the Soucars, Sirdars, and others be made by his Minister at the Residency, in my presence and with the aid of my advice, and he agrees to abide by the settlements so made. His Highness has as yet acted entirely up to his assurances, and has, in no degree that I am aware of, obstructed matters, or done otherwise than give immediate sanction to the suggestions submitted to him. His Highness, during our private interviews, has made me three remark able requests— —That I would, in an unofficial and private manner, carefully and confidentially, examine the financial statement of his territories; and to aid me in this, he has permitted the Hewan to give me, confidentially, copies of all recent income and outlay sheets.( 2 ) His Highness added that he himself would go over all the state ments with me at a private visit, and would suggest reductions. 2nd. —He asked me to enquire carefully into the condition of land revej||ie, and to satisfy myself as to the causes of the recent passive resistance, on the part of the agriculturalists, to the col lection of revenue—a resistance which he attributes, as does the Minister also, to an organized system of agitation by designing persons. 3rd. —After renewing his assurance that he would thoroughly support his Minister in reform, and attend to our advice. His Highness begged— (1) that, in making financial reductions, care might be taken in regard to religious claims, with which it would be hazardous and distasteful to him to meddle; (2) that it might be borne in mind that the present revenues of the State were little more than two-thirds what they were ten years ago; and (3) His Highness repeatedly begged that, when affairs shall have been gone into and put in train to your Excellency's approval, the new Resident may be instructed to adhere to the same course. His Highness said that no consist ent system has been observed by us in our relations with the Baroda State, and that the Ruler never knew what change in policy might have place consequent upon a change in our 'personnel. I will now resume, under their several headings, the results of my enquiries consequent on the instructions of 25th July, so far as they have gone during the week I have been here. FINANCE. The income last year was, in round numbers, one crore and eleven lacs of rupees, and the total outlay was one crore and seventy lacs nearly. But of( 3 ) this total outlay, nearly forty lacs were disbursed on marriage presents to His Highness's Queen {iiot Luxmeebhai) and others, and these forty lacs will have to be met from His Highness's private purse; thus leaving a State outlay of about 130 lacs against an income of 111 lacs—deficit nineteen lacs. Eor the present year,—and supposing the cultivators to cease from their present passive resistance,—the revenue, inclusive of sayer and tribute, is estimated, after reduction in the land revenue demand, at one crore of rupees. The items, of which the above outlay of 130 lacs is composed, are remark able. The military and police expenditure amounts to about forty lacs, i. &lt;?., to about gths the estimated total revenue of the current year. The cost of administration has hitherto been very small. But this item will be heavier in the current year, owing to the introduction of our officials and to general increase in salaries. It appears that no State debt has been incurred; that is to say, the State has not raised a loan. The question arises—where did the money come from to meet last year's deficit of nineteen lacs ? I am not as yet in a position to give a complete answer to this question. But from what I learn, the extra outlay was avoided by the accident of the Sirdars refusing to receive their stipends, &amp;c., which aggregated, say, twelve lacs, and which sum is now ready to be paid virtually from His Highness's purse. REVENUE. The main origin of the present revenue difficulties is, in my opinion, to be found among the consequences of the rebellion in the United States. The Baroda territories include much of the richest soil in Guzerat, and one of its staples, if not the main staple, is cotton. When the price of cotton rapidly rose from 2 or 3 pence to 2 shillings the pound, rents rose also—the breadth of land brought under cotton was widely extended, while the ground under other crops was proportionately reduced in area. Hence the food of the people was increased in price, and the rents on miscellaneous crops rose. As a general result, the cultivators were enabled to pay an extraordinarily high land revenue. It( 4 ) appears further that, simultaneously with this great rise in prices, a ten years' land revenue settlement was made; while the purse of the State was carelessly opened to satisfy or increase miscellaneous stipends and other demands, which, under a normal condition of affairs, would have been refused: no' balance sheet was prepared in those days. Presently, the price of cotton suddenly fell ; but the land settlement and the outlays continued in force. Thus, on the one hand, the cultivators became gradually unable to meet the Government demand on their land, and, year by year, fell into arrears of payment. I understand that, down to the close of the past revenue year, the arrears of land revenue in these territories aggre gated from seventy to eighty lacs; while the cultivators, w r ho for many years had been striving to pay au assessment larger than prices could sustain, became, in some parts, impoverished, and this in spite of the natural richness of the soil. On the other hand, the Sirdars and other non-industrials, finding their allowances clipped or resumed, became discontented. However, and notwithstanding the decrease in revenue, neither His Highness nor the Minister considers the financial situation hopeless, or even gravely embarrassing, provided, as they add, the country be not distracted by causes which, during the past year, have agitated the public mind and impaired the lluler's authority. The Minister says he expects that, after the proposed reductions are made, ' income will balance outlay within three or four ' years from this date.' It is rumoured that the State jewels are worth three crores nearly, and that His Highness has some seventy or eighty lacs in his private purse; and it is added that, so soon as he feared for his guddee, he sent these private funds to Bombay, so that they should not be attached, unless under order of the High Court. To return to the revenue: A day or two after my arrival here, I found the Eesidency compound invaded by a body of Patells and their attornies. I spoke once or twice with them, and finally requested the Minister and the Head of the Revenue Department to meet the complainants at the Residency. This was done, and everything the farmers had to urge was patiently listened to. The result was that, in conformity with the petitions of the agriculturalists, the( 5 ) Durbar consented to a remission, in whole or in part, of the fourth instalment of 4 annas in the rupee on the current year's assessment, and further to forego all claims to arrears, unless after careful enquiry in each case, and this with special regard to the present circumstances of the individual affected. A pro clamation is being issued to the above effect, and it remains to be seen whe ther the cultivators will now be contented, or whether their misapprehension, as to the object of our interference with the internal affairs of Baroda, may not lead them to hold out on the trust that we shall depose the Gaekwar and grant whatever his subjects demand; for it is to be borne in mind that, among the evils consequent upon our minute interference, and the hostile attitudes of the Gaekwar and our Resident, factions or parties spring up, and the general community becomes agitated. This the Minister bitterly complains of. SIRDARS. The Minister and the Head of the Inam Department have met at the Residency to settle these claims. They sat yesterday in my room for many hours, while two ordinary cases were gone into. The pretensions of the complainants and the proposals of the Durbar were carefully, even tediously, weighed, and eventually my advice was asked as to a middle term of settlement. I had previously found reason for suspecting that the complainants trusted to our supporting their claims, regardless of the rights of the Durbar; while, on the other hand, it had seemed to me politic to treat the Sirdars as liberally as pos sible. On the whole, therefore, I determined, in the present instance, to test the truth of my suspicion, and to advise a more than liberal treatment of the complainants. Accordingly, I suggested— —That a Mekranee mercenary, who had enjoyed the profits on a body of twenty-one footmen, and who had held charge, during four years, of a levy of 300 men, should have his body of twenty-one confirmed to him; that he should be paid the full arrears he claimed; and that he should receive his previous salary of Rs. 75 per mensem as Jemadar of the Levy. The complainant objected that the Gaekwar's father-in-law would command the Levy in Chief !! I explained to the Mekranee that my advice was tendered solely at the request of His( 6 ) Highness, by permission, on this special occasion, of my Government, and in the interest of all concerned; that, if complainant declined to accept my advice, he was free to do so, and our Government would retire from further intervention. And I think your Excellency will find that agitations and pretensions have so developed here that we shall, sooner or later, have to explain to some of the discontented here that, while we are resolved not to become a party to general misrule, we are equally resolved to refrain from unnecessary inter ference, and will permit of no sedition, rebellion, or breach of the peace on a large scale. The second case was that of two Sirdars, who are personally obnoxious to the Gaekwar on account of alleged ill-conduct towards him when in confinement. His Highness said he was ready to give the complainants a liberal pension, but that he trusted they might be required to reside away from the capital, as His Highness considered his life endangered by their presence. It appeared they had previously drawn a salary of Rs. 1,800, and claimed compensation for horses and furniture. It was proposed to grant them a pension of Rs. 1,000 per annum, plus Rs. 2,500 compensation : this thev declined! . w S O U C A R S . One or two of these claims have been settled. But the heaviest claim presented such a mass of irregular proceedings on both sides, and was in such an inextricable mess, that I could arrive at no clear opinion as to its merits, unless in respect to certain Inam lands. It seems the Gaekwar's Government used to have six State Banks ! POLICE. The Gaekwar has asked for two police officers for his mofussil. It were vain to try to purge the criminal administration so long as the police is bad.( 7 ) THE ATTEMPT AT POISONING. The Commissioner of Police, Bombay, with his Detectives, is carefully en- * J %&gt; quiring into this case. PROCLAMATIONS. The Gaekwar adheres to his promises in respect to these, and in instances where the proclamations have been infracted, the cases have been traced in Court, and extracts from proceedings sent to me. Among the embarrassments here is that of partizanship. Whatever may now be done is liable to be criticized, and if possible thwarted, by the Vakeels, agitators, or others hostile to the Gaekwar's Government and reckless of the peace and prosperity of the State. No sooner was the revenue demand abated and the proclamation promised than I learned from cantonment that one of the party of the Hesidency (as it is termed) had met the farmers in camp, and urged them to refuse all terms, and await the speedy return of Colonel Phayre. Eeverting to the military question at Baroda, it should be borne in mind that the recent action of the Gaekwar in discharging the old Irregulars, Sillidars, &amp;c., was preceded by the introduction of a regular force. And I understand it to be our policy to encourage our Native States to disband their undisciplined forces and maintain small efficient forces sufficient for the State and dignity of the Chief, and for the suppression of internal disorders. We shall have to revise, perhaps, some of the recent resumptions. But this must be done carefully, or we shall end by increasing an already enormous military outlay. It is curious to remark that some inexpedient measures which have been adopted have been copied from us and misused. I sometimes fancy I can see two minds at work in the proceedings of the past few years,—one that of a servant striving to pander to his master's extravagances by aping our proceedings, and thereby collecting money or land; and the other the mind of the spendthrift Chief wasting the resources so obtained. As to the Gaekwar himself, it is mistake to deem him a fool. He is a shrewd, quick, cunning Maratha, active in mind and restless in body. Some( 8 ) of the most practical remarks I have heard here have fallen from him. At the same time he is childish, vain, sometimes almost cringing in manner, yet vulgarly tenacious in matters of etiquette and precedence. He has many of Hie attributes which distinguish men subjected to prolonged danger, political har- rassment, and other annoyances requiring the subject of them to be pliant, wary, revengeful, and quite capable, under ordinary circumstances, of con cealing his feelings. He does not drink ; but I am not sure that he does not use drugs. He was scandalously loose in regard to women. He is still an unfaithful husband, but I have heard of no recent scandals. It may be doubted whether it was wise to place a man of His Highness's antecedents and grudges on the guddee. R E S U M t. The pressing question and the key of the whole reformation is the finance. My own opinion tends towards the conviction that the revenues of these territories, inclusive of sayer and tribute, cannot safely be estimated at more than sixty lacs per annum, and that our total outlay must be revised and re-distributed to meet this income. It is, of course, an immense reduction as compared with last year's real outlay of 170 lacs, or State outlay of 130 lacs. However, I find that in the time of the present Gaekwar's father the revenues stood at about sixty lacs, and I am advising His Highness, not indeed precisely to imitate his father's outlay, but to accept it as a guide to, and limit of, expenditure. And this His Highness and the Minister promise to do. The necessary statements will be ready in a few days, and we then set to work. The next question is that of the attitude of the agriculturalists towards the Durbar. How much of this is due to agitation and to hopes raised by our interference ? And what residuum is there of permanent or solid com plaint ? The present proclamation in regard to remissions being issued, I propose to let it have its effect, and for a time to rest quiet, and let matters cool down. We shall meantime learn whether the cultivators persist in their resolve not to pay even the first instalment of revenue. If they do this, they( 9 ) will go far to convict themselves of wilful passive resistance to the legitimate demands of their Government. The Sirdar class have already committed themselves, by combined resistance, to the Gaekwar's authority; while the Gaekwar, on the other hand, has com mitted faults, as we know, in many directions. Every one is more or less in the wrong, and in an utter state of mess or confusion. I feel myself like a physician called in to treat a very complicated case. If the \arious members of the organism attend to, or submit to, treatment, I think the patient may recover; that is, if the finance question don't prove unmanageable. I3ut if the financial question, or other accident, prove too much for the present organism, why we must let it die scientifically, and re-organise the constituent under new conditions for a time. The alternatives are habitually present to my mind, and I feel no anxiety. In fact, a cheerful coolness is very desirable here just at present. Meantime the work, current and special, is about as much as I can manage. Your Lordship's faithful and obedient servant, LEWIS PELLY. P. S.—Finally, and whatever may prove to be issue of the crisis here, or the success or otherwise of my personal endeavours in regard thereto, these cannot alter the character of the counsel I would respectfully and earnestly submit to your Excellency, viz., to resolve, so soon as may be con venient, on the line of policy and the nature of the relations which shall henceforward be maintained towards the Baroda State, and to render the line of policy and action permanent and consistent.( 10 ) Sir R. Meade, in favoring me with a private note, writes— ' I have never looked for any good from the existing arrangements at ' Baroda, and the whole character of our system and relations there appeared ' to me to be very different from my experience of these matters at the other ' Chief Courts with which I have had to do.' My observation and experience lead me to share in this opinion. Had Baroda formed one of a congeries of States under an Agent Governor-General of Central India or Rajpootana, the mere force of routine and system, con trolled and guided by steady maxims of policy from the foreign Office, would have rendered the present state of affairs here almost impossible. The present Gaekwar would never have been removed from his prison to the guddee—his extravagance and pretensions would have been checked—our minute interfer ence would not have raised false hopes and distracted the State—no Commission would have come here to find itself in something very like a quandary—the action of Government would not have been hesitating, as that of a local Gov ernment subject to the judgment of a Supreme Government must always be liable to become—and an officer trained in the Quarter-Master-General's Department, and inexperienced in our Native Courts, would not have been sent here.
