Wazir to h.xa. the Sultan of Muscat &amp; Oman.»R 1 ® i irreiiminary note on Shihuh politics, A brief note would appear to be necessary to give recent eirents a bacicground. The Shihuh are the rude, suspicious and wild inhabitants of RU l US AL JAbAh. hossibly in part aborigi nal ( their alleged descent from the Azdite invader of the 2nd Centu^iry A.h. Malik bin tfaham is improbable) they are more ignorant and uncouth than their neighbours either of Trucial Oman or of the oulanante.hthnologi cally they are not one. The Kumazara of the villages of Aumz&amp;r exclusively and of Ahasb and i.imah partly are Iranian elements,racially and linguistically peculiar, and it is they who have established a shaikhly ascendancy over tne southern half of the ahihuh, by v/hich tribe in name and politics they have been absorbed. This southern confederation by name J^ani bhatair and a northern one .Bani Hadiyah together compose the Sihhuh Ixkx tribe. The seats of their Shaikhs are Dibah and Khasb respectively. These towns are the foci of Shihuh politics. The tv/o Sheikhs are generally regarded as equal and rival, iheir respective confederations the jsani nadiyah and the nani shatair v with which is associated the numazaaca) are traditional enemies and are normally divided by old blood feuds. nistoric&amp;lly, the keeping of the tribal peace between these tv/o elements has been the ‘raison d^tre 1 of the sulatanate wall at nhksab. The Shihuh, v/hen free from external cares are thus a house divided aganist itself, but they unite in the face of the common enemy -traditionally the neighbour ing ^wASIm tribe, ihe shihuh belong to the ninawi factior the tyAWASIM to the U-nAFARI faction. The menace which the ^AWASIlti. constituted for the inhabitants of musandam. jrage -i 2 i - Musandam accounts for the merging of the humazara and interior Shihuh elements: it also explains the adhesion of the Shihuh tribe as a whole to the Muscat State. The Shihuh looked to the Imam Saiyid Sa^d bin sultan for protection from the i^awasim when he waged hie wars against the common enemy in the early years of the last century, tfrom the time of Saiyid sa^d son saiyid Thuwaini onwards a tfali appoint ed from Muscat has throughout, it is believed, resided at rihasab fort. The presence of this wall was desirable to the Shihuh standing as it did for the moral support of Muscat, vis a vis the i^awasim. And the wali functioned vide Miles Vol. 2 pp.446 in the manner i have indicated. The last shihuh - ^AwASim trouble occurred in 1922 ostensibly over a territorial question connected with rtAMS and SHA , AfkJ a local Alsace -Lorraine. One of ri.M. Ship was employed for the conference. The issue favoured tne fyAWASllh Several Shihuh sheikhs og whom one was sheikh nasan the present Malcontent v/ere taken off to Muscat and imprisoned there. To the unwillingness or inability of Muscat to maintain its traditional support of shihuh versus ^AV/ASIm in the day of trouble, may be ascribed a certain cooling of their loyalty, cause at any rate is not to be found in any excess of state interference rather the reverse, for the v*ali‘s authority for some years past has been shadowy: Revenue taken from the shihuh is of the lightest kind, none in fact outside the twon of Ahasab where a nominal ‘zakat* in kind on dates, onions and sheep provides about 600 rupees annually - a bagatelle, and not sufficient to maintain the fia.ll and his askaries. Customs imposts are nowhere imposed on the shihuh as they are elsewhere along the suiAAnate gggy0 rage 3 : - Traditionally, the shihuh, of all tribes , are said to have been boastful of their loyalty to the sons of Sa^d bin buitan i.e. the Albu Sa*id uynasty, and rn the Oman UiVil war some 16 years ago towards the end of Sultan Faisals reign, Shihuh elements fought at hidbid under the Muscat banner. Of late years however the Muscat ties would seem to have beenweaicening. Three factors have contributed to this. (1) the passing of the old native form of trovernment regime in Muscat itself - the patriarchal form that preceded the council of state - when tribal sheiichs periodically visited the Kuler, a personal ruler, and came away with ‘bahta* ( present of rice &lt;sc coffee &amp; money, perhaps of ammunition if the Sheikh had a war in hand at the time). ui) a changing qawasim situation which has strucJc at the roots of the mutual identity of interests. (ill) a realigning of shihuh. sentiment towards the iruci&amp;l side; for the resentment to foreign activities, a natural condition of mind in the rude shihuh, find the xrucial spirit, recently exemplified in the unaccommodating attitude towards K.A.F. activities, more m accord with its ownrage - * 2 *- Sheikh i;aiharrmiad is unquestioned master of xsakha though three nephews of importance live with him Ahmad, Abduliah and suiaiman ail aulad Muhammad.

Sheikh nasan is traditionally the enemy of Sheikh Salah but intered into agreement mfcx with him for presenting a solid front to protect their supposed matual interests in the Ormonde incident, ne is traditionally in alliance with nakha and opposed to juunzar. ne married a daughte of the late aheikh of nimah by whose recent death he is said to have inherited considerable property at limah.

The resistance by the aheilch to survey party activities and the attempt to oust Muscat Authority are interrelated incidents. II. A natural impulse of this fanatical tribe jealous to i preserve its soil xmia unmolested by infidels was a revenge itself on the Muscat government that had dared to aid and abet. III. Up to this time tne Muscat connection was obviously not Irksome, .ay it the Shihuh profiled nothing, suffered no tiling, feared nothnmg. In fact they claimed to cherish a sentiment for Muscat, hevulsion of feeling is the outcome of the imagined disservice of Muscat to ahihuh interests. IV. The shihuh, close neighbours of Has al Ahaima and eye witnesses of the latter's attitude towards h.A.j. - a position not improbably magnified in the tribal mind to defiance of British interests with impunity, have been emboldened to emulate example. v. Sheikh nassan of Ahasab could not have taken up the uncompromising line he did without assurance of the sworn backing of his rival Sheikh Saiah of Diba and his Aumzari allies. VI. Sheikh nasan 1 s acquiescence to survey rarty's design in the first place would seen to have a blind, followed as it was by an immediate volte face. The equivocation that followed was apparently designed to gam time in order to canvass support for a united resistance. VII. There was a close pact ( made between 30th January and 3rd February) throughtout between the sheikhs of Ahasab and Diba and 3 of the 4 sheikhs of Aumzara. The one Aumzari Sueiich who appears to have remained loyal to authority was Muhammad bin Ali al Mahdi. This presumption needs testing by reference to the signatories of their letter addressed to the Sheikh of Bakha ( it is understood that a copy waswas forwarded to political resident by the joritisn Agent; • VIII. The Sheiich of jiaidia's particpation or otherwise in the pact is not clear from present evidence. A strong suspicion attaches to his nephew Ahmad bin Muhammad of Bakha. The apparent misunderstanding which arose over the Shiekh’s personal dispute with the aheiim of ithasab the unwillingness of each to meet the other and the unsatis factory incident of the ownership of the hill look as though these delaying Incidents were part of a concerted plan. Aganist this and in the sheikh’s favour is the tremendously important step he took of showing the British Agent a secret letter incriminating all but one of the / other sheikhs of ahihuh.25 ». 4 The present situation. aheiieh nasan of ahasab is on a visit to .Liman and Diba. The rumour that he has gone there and to Fujairah to enlist the support of thr tribes in the event of punitive action being taicen against nim ( as indicated in P.R ! 8 telegram lio. 291) so far lacks confirmation but it is not improbable, ne was reported to be at al _jarsha near Diba on 27th the day I left Diba. x have written to him to come at Ahasab to see me. r,: I landed at tsumazar on 27th where situation is normal. Sk. Muhammad bin All ai Mahdi&amp; Sh.Muharmnad bin Hilal are v&lt;ith me in Al Sa’id, The other two 8h.ie.khs AbdulJ^h bin aultan and' Aid bin lasir are in Diba. The wali is still living in his fort at ishasab but without influence and indeed is unable to go in safely to the village where the aheikh^s order for bidding tiie bazaar to sell him food still holds, ne is therefore still being sustained from one or other of the ships in harbour - at present Al sa‘id. The aheiim has left a retainer one nilal bin All ,in his place. This man has not called on me in Al Sa’id but in response to my letter inviting him to do so has expressed his willing ness to receive me ashore. As this man has no full powers to treat for ahiekh nasan or the Shihuh T have not considered such a meeting with him necessary. At Diba when x arrived on 26th aheikh 8alah came t to see me. ~e was clearly frightened, x did not confrorr him with his letter a by which he had incriminated himself at the outset, as it may later prove to be politic to localise the area of punitive measures. . Conditions in the Shihuh country render the nature/ and scope of punitive measures a matter requiring much careful consideration. Ahasab is a cove flanked by steep cliffs where concealed tribesmen could make landing a matter of some difficulty.The beach itself is a gently shelving one involving long stretches of dangerous wading especially at some stages of the tide. It is baciced by a date grove which would afford considerable cover to defenders. The old Portuguese fort ib in a state of rum and would have to be built up in animproved way from inside by any force that landed to occupy it. These considerations plus hostile nf&amp;e strength of 1500 and behind it ail a fanatical and unyielding spirit are considerations which in my judgment preculde the possibility of using the Muscat infantry with any hope of HHggggg success. The Shihuh derive a good deal of their livelihood from fishing sea trading and pearl fishing. They are therefore vulnerable to sea power* and could be made to suffer by a blockade. rressure also could be applied by the sequestration of certain date gardens owned by them in the hatinah. This measure in itself however would be insufficinet to induce a spirit of KMrYwxanigg surrender. Such measures could perhaps be considered as threats to be carried out in the event of she .ish nasan not agreeing to a fine payment or personal surrender to be followed by his imprisonment in muscat. iou may deem the envisaging of such contingencies premature at tne moment as tne sheilch has not yet returned to hhasab and it is not considered possible for him to return before Wednesday 2nd at the earliest, indeed in view of (l) the seriousness of~his later actions, witness letter &amp; to \ Sheilch Isa purporting to come from some nonentity but obviously inspired by the Sheilch (ii; the excellent sanctuary his inaccessible mountains provide, he may not be prepared at this stage and without some pressure to come in of his own free will and treat for terms.—,— I'ipyji.. wmmm** rage 3 If it is considered necessary I may empi&amp;y tke next few days assisting the Senior haval Officer to investigate in detail the possible alternative courses of action, may I say txiat tribal pspchology being what it is. i am of poinion that if sufficient action is not taicen, the landing of hritish personnel in the Shihuh country in future will be attended with grave risics.
