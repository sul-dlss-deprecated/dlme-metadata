These details are captured on draft papers and official telegrams sent between HM Minister at Kabul and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The coded telegrams from the Foreign Office to Kabul are referred to as 'Forminka' telegrams (a name derived from a combination of letters from the words 'Foreign', 'Minister', and 'Kabul'), whereas those sent from Kabul to London are referred to as 'Katodon' telegrams (a name created using letters from the words 'Kabul' 'to' and 'London').</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Telegrams</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002d7#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
