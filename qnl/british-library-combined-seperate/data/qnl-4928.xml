The station was initially run by the Indo-European Telegraph Department (a department of the Government of India), but from 1931 responsibility passed to a public company, Imperial and International Communications Limited (from 1934 known as Cable and Wireless Limited). The main correspondents are the Political Agent, Bahrain, and the Officer-in-Charge of the radio station. There is also some correspondence from the Government of Bahrain.The papers cover issues such as: interruptions to wireless traffic; complaints about the service; the ownership of wireless sets by individuals; installation of telephone lines; maintenance of the telegraph system; the title deeds for the land on which the radio station was built; the provision of drinking water for employees at the station; recruitment of staff; notices and circulars; arrangements for Christmas and New Year greetings telegrams; and special arrangements caused by the Second World War (1939-45).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd, Officer in Charge, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indo-European Telegraph Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Wireless telegraphy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001f4#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001f4#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001f4#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001f4#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001f4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
