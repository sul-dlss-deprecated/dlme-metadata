He probably realises that Governor of Hasa was guilty of indiscretion but takes the offensive as the best means of defence© 2a Any rejoinder must depend somewhat on your reaction to my telegram No.120 and observations of authorities at Kowcit on argument that normal crossing of frontier includes passage of parties accompanied by Sheikh's troopsc Subject to these factors I suggest that I should reply on the following general lines before I leave on June 7tho 3, His Majesty's Government are glad to infer that the messengers did not belong to the King’s organised forces but were Saleh retainers of Governor of Hasa, It is nevertheless clear that they belonged to the party sent by him in the first place to collect Zikat, If they simply intended to go to Koweit for the purpose indicated they exposed themselves to grave misunderstanding by staying two days at Subaihiya and diverging from che usual route to visit Jaiira, It could only be inferred from these facts and from language held by them to the tribes that their mission was to put pressure on them while still in Koweit territory to return to Saudi Arabia and pay Zikato His Majesty's Government hope that steps will be taken to prevent recurrence of such action which presents at leastm V' 2c least the appearance of attempting to exercise authority in the King’s name outside his territory. For the rest neither they nor the Sheikh wish to interfere with any existing practice as regards crossing the frontier for legitimate purposes. On the contrary they welcome assurance of Saudi Government for their desire to promote restoration of economic relations which have long been interrupted* It was because they shared this desire that they did not on their side in any way connect incident of May 6th with arrangements for proposed conferenceo Addressed to Foreign Office, repeated to India No°74-, Bushire for Political Resident in the Persian Gulf No c 158 f and Koweit No* 139o* Decode.

The following is a very condensed, surmury. Swudi Governi'^ont have held enquiry and are still pursuing it as they do not wish any incident to disturb their relations with rr is Majesty’s Governn.ont end the Sheikh who is the King’s intimate friend. In view of facts ascertained they chiefly regret that this simple incident should he represented as armed incursion intended to violate Sheikh’s sovereignty. movement between the two countries of subjects and messengers carrying arms is an every day occurence. Persons now in question were four not six. They belonged to a party of his retainers whom the Governor of Hasa had deputed to assemble the tribesmen at a certain spot and to collect Zikat. Sharmor had been summoned to Mutair watering places but on arrival of party found that they were still in ICoweit territory. Commander therefore sent messengers to Koweit to telegraph to the Governor for instructions. Natural route was via Subaihiya end Johra. messengers may have informed tribesmen whom they met on the way where Zikat was being collected so that they might make hasty payment and escape liability to subsequent punishment. Having picked up a car the three messengers2 went on to Koweit to telegraph whereupon they were ordered ^ out of Koweit territory. Note develops further the thesis that crossing of the frontier in doth directions hy armed parties without ^ permission is normal, e.g., Sheikh’s messengers going to the river and Hasa and members of the Sheikh's family visiting Saudi Arabia accompanied by his troops to hunt. If the Governor of Koweit objects to the visit of Saudi subjects and messengers, Saudi Government must apply reciprocal treatment though they consider it contrary to prevailing friendship and to efforts they are making to promote economic relations. In view of treatment accorded to his messengers the Governor of Hasa has been instructed to prevent all entry into Koweit. Saudi Government request that pending an agreement Koweit authorities should prevent officials and others from entering Saudi territory for any purpose without previous permission as expulsion of messengers has coused perturbation amongst the tribes and has been regarded as hostile action at a time when Saudi Government are straining every nerve to establish close and friendly relations.

                           zikaton behalf of the Governor of Hasa from members of the Shammar tribe. The papers include discussion of the incident by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the British Legation, Jedda, the India Office, and the Foreign Office; a complaint over the incident by the British Government to the Saudi Government; subsequent diplomatic contacts, including the text of letters from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and further discussion by British officials.The King of Saudi Arabia (referred to as Bin Saud [Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd]) was said in extracts from Kuwait intelligence summaries dated July 1935 (folios 25-26) to be 'greatly annoyed' by British protests over the incident, and likely to retaliate against Kuwait. However, in a further incident (folio 6) in August 1935 Saudi citizens pursuing a fugitive were said to have followed procedure by carrying a letter with them. This is said by the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven William Fowle) in a letter dated 29 October 1935 (folio 5) to show that the previous protests made by the British Government 'had had a good effect'.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Koweit</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial rights</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000199#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
