Normal revenue during 1359 decreased by about 3^ lakhs : the falling off was mainly in customs receipts and oil royalty. The difficulty in obtaining transport for oil was one of the causes of the reduced oil output. The condition of the pearl industry was worse than in any year in which results have been recorded, and while the war lasts there is little chance of any improvement. The cost of living in Bahrain increased considerably in spite of the measures taken by the Government to prevent profiteering by controlling the prices of essential commodities. Owing to the reduction in the activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, a bad diving season, and no important public works employing local labour being carried out by the Government, there was much unemployment in Bahrain and distress among the poorer people. All these conditions were due directly or indirectly to the war. During the year His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifah granted the Bahrain Petroleum Company an oil concession over the remaining unallocated area of the Bahrain islands. This concession had been under consideration for some lime. The company began to work in the area covered by the new concession. An additional 16^ lakhs was added to the Reserve Fund and invested in 3^ per cent War Loan, bringing up the total of the reserve to £500,000 sterling. The expenditure during the year amounted to Rs. 29,14,000, of which approximately half was paid to the Ruling Family. Much progress was made in medical and educational work during the vear. The two Government hospitals, for men and for women, were opened, and the anti-malaria work was extended into the cultivated area and the villages beyond the neighbourhood of Manamah with satisfactory results. Many improvements were made in the schools by the employment of better qualified teachers in the country schools as well as in the towns and a new final school was opened in Manamah. The state of public security was good. There were no serious crimes during the year and no political disturbances. Traffic accidents, which at one time caused a very high proportion of deaths, decreased considerably. The budget for 1360 is a conservative one. On the revenue side an income of Rs. 35,64,000 is expected which is almost 9^ lakhs less than was anticipated in 1359. The revenue in 1359 was 49 lakhs, but this included several large abnormal receipts. On the expenditure side provision has been made for increased expendi ture on public protection, including war-time defence measures and on medical services. The principal public works to be done during the year are the completion of the hospital and the Manamah Muharraq bridge, which was delayed owing to the material not having arrived from England, and the construction of married quarters at the Fort. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, C .B.E. Bahrain, May, 1941.41 REVENUE 1359. ; 1 (v ) •jj, i The estimated revenue in the Budget for 1359 was Rs. 45,07,000. The actual revenue collected was Rs. 49,01,499. The actual revenue exceeded the anticipated amount by Rs. 3,94,449. The actual revenue in 1358 was Rs. 45.78,765- Revenue in 1359 exceeded that of 1358 by Rs. 3,22,734. The 1359 receipts, however, included two abnormal items amounting to Rs. 5,61,972, being' the payment made by the Bahrain Petroleum Company on signing the oil concession over the additional area and the price obtained by the Government from the sale of rice which had been bought in 1358 as a special war measure. If these two items of abnormal revenue are not taken into consideration the revenue in 1359 was Rs- 43&gt;39»5 2 7» which is Rs. 2,39,238 less than the revenue during the previous year. Customs revenue was approximately lakhs lower, oil royalty was approximately Rs. 83,000 less, and there was a decrease of approximately Rs. 48,000 in land revenue. This last item in 1358 included some abnormal receipts. Other sources of revenue produced slightly less than in the previous year. During the year Rs. 16,52,745 was added to the Reserve Fund and invested in War Loan. EXPENDITURE 1359. The total expenditure during the year was Rs. 29,14,372, excluding the amount paid into the Reserve Fund. Approximately one half of the total expenditure was paid to the Ruling Family in the Civil List and one third of the oil revenue. The amount spent on special public works, mostly of a non-recurrent nature, was Rs. 3,18,000. This was about three lakhs less than the budgetted amount owing to the non-completion of the Manamah—Muharraq bridge. The cost of administration, which includes the various Govern ment offices, courts, education, medical services, municipalities, and recurrent public works, was approximately seven lakhs. Unforseen expenditure, Rs. 46,000, includes the cost of bazaar property, amounting to Rs. 39,000, which was purchased by the Government when sold by a Persian subject. Total expenditure in 1358 was Rs. 36,75,434 and in 1359 it was Rs. 29,14,372. The expendi ture in 1359 was approximately Rs. 7,61,000 less than during the previous year. In 1358 a con tribution of Rs. 4,00,000 was given to the British Government towards the cost of the war and Rs. 1,36,000 was spent on purchasing rice; excluding these sums the normal expenditure in 1358 was approximately Rs. 31,39,000 and the 1359 expenditure was about 2} lakhs less than during the previous year. Special Public Works. —The expenditure was 3 lakhs less than the amount anticipated in the budget for 1359; in this budget provision was made for Rs. 6,21,000 to be spent on special public works whereas the actual expenditure was Rs. 3,18,000. The chief expenditure on special new works during the year was on the Manamah—Muharraq bridge and the Government Hospital. The bridge was expected to have been finished during the year but owing to the war it is not yet complete. The entire superstructure and machinery for opening the bridge was ready for shipment from England many months before the end of the year but owing to transport difficulties it failed to arrive. Three piers and the reinforced concrete dolphin were completed and much of the reinforced concrete extension was built. The piles and about 30 per cent of the deck of the dolphin were finished during the year. It is estimated that it will take about five months from the date of arrival of the material to complete the whole work. Local labour was used in the construction work under the supervi sion of British foremen. Arab divers were specially useful in fixing the central submarine cassion. The women's hospital was completed and opened on May 25th, 1940 (Rabi althanv 18th, 1359), and the men's hospital was brought into use some months later. 1 he ground floor walls of the administrative building were built and the hospital, kitchen, male nurses' quarters, walls, gates and mess room were completed during the year. The administrative building will contain two operating theatres, X-Ray rooms, stores, laboratory and offices. I he two hospitals have a combined capacity of 100 beds but in case of emergency a considerably larger number of patients could be accommodated. The expenditure during the year on the women's hospital was Rs. 15,600 and on the men's hospital Rs. 49,000. The expenditure on the administrative building, staff quarters, kitchen, etc., was Rs. 32,800. The total cost of the men's hospital, including electric, water and sanitary installations, amounted to approximately Rs. 1,32,000. The nurses' quarters and the Lady Medical Officer's flat and Matron's flat cost approximately Rs. 86,000.12 Approximately Rs. 16,500 was spent on the Manamah Fort. All the outer walls and the four corner towers have now been rebuilt. The north east tower contains a large office on the iirst floor and a store on the ground floor: this and the eastern wall and the north-eastern tower were built during the year. Additional latrines were made and the inside garden was fenced. * .Work was commenced, but not completed, on the new Technical School workshop. The building, which is 120'x 40', is adjacent to the existing Technical School and its dimensions are according to the recommendations of Mr. G. E. H utchings , Principal of the Baghdad TVchnical School, who visited Bahrain in order lo advise the Government on technical education. I hi; root is carried on reinforced concrete beams supported by reinforced concrete pillars. Owing Jo ihe price of steel beams and the difficulty of obtaining them this method of construction was adopted for the first time in Bahrain. The old building, together with the new workshop, will provide accommodation for about 100 boys. The amount spent on this building was Rs. 13,000. Some improvements were made to the customs premises during the year, including an ollice at the entrance to the pier and trolley lines and lighting on the pier extension. The cost of this was approximately Rs. 10,000. Other work included additional Government garages, additional class rooms in the Manamah school, an extension to the Nairn dispensary, enlarging the jail at Jida, building stables for the Government cattle, building a coffee-shop and a bathing shelter at Adari, and the upkeep and repairs of Government buildings, roads, and bridges. THE PEARL INDUSTRY. The report of the diving results for the year 1359 is a depressing record. The year 1358 was a bad one but the 1359 season was even worse. There appears no prospect of any improvement while the war lasts; the European markets are closed, and there is no activity in America in spite of the fact that it ^-vvas announced from Germany on the radio that there was a boom in diamonds and pearls. 1 here was some activity in the Indian market but the demand there is usually for second-grade pearls. Onl} I 9 I boats went to sea, which is a decrease of 28 when compared to the number of boats licensed in the previous season. This is the lowest number of boats diving since proper records have been kept by the Government, and it is probable that not all of them will be used in the 1360 season. Prices were lower than last year though the catch appears to have been larger. The best pearl which was found during the season was sold for Rs. 15,000. At the end of the season there was some improvement in prices but they never reached last year's level. No important buyers visited Bahrain except Shaikh Mohomed Ali Zaina! who bought practically nothing The biggest local buyers were Haj Khalil Moayad and Haj Sulman bin Isa Kuwaiti. ' Pearl prices during the season were as follows: . Rs - Rs - Rs. Rs. Sherm ... 25 to 30 per chow. Na . am „ t0 per chow Golwa ... 8 to 10 per chow. Badla ... 3 to 4 per chow. The total catch, according to calculations based partly on actuals and partly on averages was worth Rs. 5 ,19,000, which is approximately one lakh less than last year's value This figure represents the amount received by divers and nakhudas from the sale of pears which is less fhan the value of the pearls when they are exported from Bahrain. Merchants, nakhudas, and divers had a poor year. Merchants and nakhudas in some ways ^red relatively worse than the divers, because the divers at least received their official advances Out of the 60 boats diving on the selafieh system only seven boats covered the expenses In the wl^al 5 follows 8 '* ^ d,VerS and PUllerS Were ,eSS than the t0tal 0f their annUaI advan « s Tesqam Selaf Kharjieh Total Diver.

Rs. 25 20 25 20 20 20 70 60iR) 13 Of the total number of boats diving 60 were on the selafieh system and 94 were Khamamis It is probable that the latter did somewhat better than the selafieh divers because the expenses of the khamas system are usually lower than those of the selafieh boats and the divers are content to work for lower advances than the maximum which is laid down by the Government. These recent years of continued depression in the pearl industry have affected the attitude of the public towards the industry as a whole. The few remaining- 'big nakhudas would gladly get out of the industry if they could do so but in most cases all that they have is invested in their boats and their only assets are the divers who are indebted to them.' Diving is no longer regarded by young men as a profitable occupation with the possibility of making big money but as a temporary employment when all else fails. The old race of divers is dying out and nakhudas complain that the new tye of men who enlist as divers are very inferior to the' men of the past. POLICE AND PUBLIC SECURITY.

Several guards of honour were provided during the year and the usual r; i:: ZL°Z. section. From this centre the coast was patrolled as far as the refinery on the north and Ra's-Al-14 Barr on the south. Prisoners were taken to Jaw and a road was built across the pass above Hafira to Door and Jaw. The horse section was divided into two, and half of it stationed at Budt^a, from where patrols were made daily to Zellaq, Rafaa, Manamah, Sakhir and other parts of the middle of the island which are normally inaccessible to motor traffic. T he mounted patrols keep in contact with the villages in districts which are normally never visited by police. (c) Prisoners. —The maximum number of prisoners during the year was 90. A new jail was built on Jida island which is used as a penal settlement for long-term prisoners. 1 he prisoners work in the garden, which is supplied with an artesian well, and cut stone, for building purposes, from the quarries which were in use about five centuries ago. One section of the police is stationed at Jida for jail duty. The island is drier and healthier than the mainland and fish are abundant. It is a popular post. Prison labour was also used in erecting a building near the rifle range at Safra to accommodate police when firing musketry courses. 1 he building obviates the use of tents which were c satisfactory. [d) Promotions and Appointments. —Abdulkarim bin Haji Sulman, who had previously served in the State Police, reaching the rank of Havildar, was appointed Sub-Inspector of Police on his return from training in India.

By degrees the naturs are acquiring efficiency in simple squad and arms drill and in musketry. They form a useful and inexpensive force and have taken over some of the guards and patrols which were instituted at the beginning of the war. 3.—Crime. Few serious crimes occurred during the year. There was one stabbing case, and there was an increase in the number of thefts. This increase was partly owing to the amount of unemployment and the rise in the cost of living. Although more traffic accidents were investigated than in 1358 there was only one fatal accident, a collision between a motor-bicycle and a lorry resulting in the death of a Sikh. In the 313 criminal cases which were dealt with by the police during the year, 143 of the persons connected with the cases were foreigners and 170 were Bahrain subjects. The population of Bahrain is approximately 100,000, so the amount of crime does not appear to be excessive. The crime record of 1358 and 1359 is given below.— Crime record of years 1359 and 1358.

Eye-Disease is a scourge which is so endemic and tenacious that the people themselves have become dulled to the potency of its terrible complications, which have led to so much total blindness. Trachoma is mainly responsible for this, and 70 per cent of all opthalmia is due to it. 20 per cent of all out-patients come because of bad eyes, and fortunately they are very agreeable to long courses of treatment. 2. Malaria. —The numbers attending are considerably less. While early yet to give reliable statistics, the figures already show a marked decrease in Manama. The peak months were again May and June. 3. Venereal Disease. —All stages are seen, but the nervous tertiary forms are uncommon. Secondary syphilis, showing widespread skin and throat ulcers, is seen frequently, especially in the villages, and is extremely infectious. Good results are hoped for from the Isolation Hospital, where follow up work after cure is being inaugurated. 4. Dysentery. —This is nearly all due to the Entamoeba Histolytica, and is most common in the spring and autumn months, when it almost reaches epidemic form. To enforce strict rules for the carrying out of improved town sanitarv methods is the only way to eradicate this disease. 5. Asthma. —This is a serious bronchial complaint. Diet and humidity both play a part in causing it. When once it establishes a hold in a patient it is practically impossible to cure. Temporary relief for acute attacks can be achieved most readily, but only too soon a recurrence of symptoms occurs. 6. Mumps reached minor epidemic form in may and June this year. It is chiefly in children, though adults become also attacked. Its ready spread is due to lack of segregation owing to people not treating this disease seriously, 7. Other Diseases. —Rheumatic disease in all its forms is common, especially arthritis and myositis. Rheumatic fever is only occasionally seen. Dermatitis of the scalp is frequently found in the schools, and whooping cough, Phthysis (pulmonary tuberculosis) has not been recorded much. The few cases seen have been usually severe, and have died shortly after. More detailed examinations will certainly reveal many more, as it is more common than it appears to be.

Eye disease ag-ain is the most prevalent disease. Malaria is of a higher incidence in Muharraq as compared to Manama. It is hoped that this will be lowered next year. The Sakhir malaria figures are highest of all proportionately, but the figures may not be accurate there, because a compounder runs the dispensary. Venereal disease is most prevalent in Suk Al-Khamis and Sitra. Minor operations are usually for boils, abscesses, and teeth ; and quinine and emetine the commonest injections given. Dr. Lakra was in-charge of Suk Al-Khamis up to November, when he took over from Dr. Bhandarkar at Muharraq. This dispensary had had a set back in the summer because of Dr. Bhandarkar's holiday. It was visited from Manama weekly, and run by orderlies who administered only the simplest forms of treatment. Abdul Majid, the compounder to H. H. The Shaikh of Bahrain, has held small daily clinics in Sakhir throughout most of the year. I he other dispensaries now come under a regular visiting scheme by doctors from Manama, with the exception of Karazakhan, which has been closed. Sitra, Badaya, and Rifa'a were visited three times weekly in the hot weather instead of once a week. After a short hiatus during Ramadan the scheme was renewed, but reduced to twice weekly because of the increase of work in Manama. The clinics are held in the natur posts of Budaya and Sitra and in Sheikh Ali bin Ahmad's majlis In Rifa'a. The Budaya patients are not many, and some of them come from Bani Jamra and Draz. In Rifa'a it is the school children who attend well and very regularly, Sitra has proved the most promising field of work. Anti-malaria work is also being done there, and this has been appreciated and has attracted patients to the clinic, Fortv to fifty are verv often seen and their complaints arc various, chiefly eye disease, coughs and colds, worms, rheumatism and malaria. The latter is not common, but most malaria patients are too weak or ill to come, according to report. Round worms are always complained of here, due to faulty methods of preparing their fish for eating. Patients come from all the six villages and beyond, Jidah has been a difficult place to visit regularly because of the journey. It is usually now seen once a month. Serious complaints are rare, because the climate is good, and dryer. Lately several cases of dysentery were brought over to the Hospital. These were nearly all amoebic and it is thought that the eating ot a certain green herb on the island, which grows in the winter months, was responsible for inciting an already chronic latent dysentery. The prisoners there usualK number between twelve and eighteen. 1 heir quarters have been enlarged and are adequate and healthy.

The above police paiieuts include all ihe personnel of the Fort, and prisoners.I 18 (c) The Police Clinic. The above summary shows a total decrease of one thousand out-patients on the previous year, which points to improved health. Reliable comparisons on last year regarding malaria cannot be obtained, but their numbers have dropped quite markedly. Eye disease is not common and gives relatively little trouble, and this in large measure is due to the strict medical examina tion they have to undergo when recruited. Venereal disease is still causing some concern, and special examinations for this will be coming into being at regular intervals, when the whole Force will be seen. It is hoped that these figures will be reduced when those harbouring the disease are under regular treatment and control. On the whole their health is good, and the out-patient work consists largely of treating petty ailments such as traumatic ulcers, coughs, colds and injuries. Porty-five in-patients were admitted up to the time of closure of the Police Hospital, and now all cases are admitted into the main Hospital. Admission in the past was usually for malaria, venereal disease, and severe traumatic skin lesions especially from the cavalry section. This is so now, but others are being treated surgically for piles, fistula-in-ano, and hernia. The prisoners come with such ailments as ulcers of the leg, dysentery, venereal disease, and chest complaints, and many of them have to be admitted for these diseases. One of the most satisfactory features of this clinic has been the fact that all patients must attend regularly until they are cured. The disease can therefore be followed through from start to finish, and better lines of treatment can therefore be laid down.

Those who came in received great benefit from the new '693' treatment. The percentage of cures for asthma (67 per cent) is optimistic as no cure can be made unless they are taken in hand from the beginning. \ ery severe and almost moribund cardiac cases were admitted with a 50 per cent mortality.Other deaths, which were all medical except one, were from tuberculosis, inanition (particularly in the hot weather), chronic suppuration, and injuries. Surgically good results were obtained with the piles and hernias. Some ol the fistula patients did not do well due to intercurrent diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis, which caused their death. The fractures were all major ones due to road accidents chiefly, and the Kirschner wire skeletal traction method of immobilisation in a Thomas' Splint or a Braun Irame was adopted with fair success. The Eye Section has been taken last because of its importance. Trachoma, with its accom panying complications of keratitis, pannus, trichiasis,speaks for itself. Most eye disease, especially trachoma, is preventable, and the most successful lines of treatment in the future will be by preventative measures and simple propaganda. Malnutrition plays a part, but improved personal hygiene to limit its contagious spread is the most important factor, and should begin in the homes and schools. Conjunctivitis, corneal ulcer, iritis and irido-cyctitis, and secondary glaucoma are all rela tively common. Primary glaucoma is not often seen. Keratitis, diffuse and localised, are found repeatedly in every stage. Rare forms of eye disease are keratoconus and kerato-malacia. Staphy loma is in a class by itself in children and young adults, and the treatment is extremely unsatis factory in preventing total blindness, even when taken in hand at the outset. Cataract in all its forms is seen here as frequently as anywhere in the East. Congenital, traumatic, senile, and glaucomatous are the chief varities, and a large measure of successful treatment for restoration of sight can be effected.

The most outstanding' necessary operation at the present time seems to be for haemorrhoidsj 86 cases were dealt in the eight months. Many of them were severe, and a few had to be done twice. 1 he method of cauterisation after excision works very successfully, and the average numbc r of days in hospital necessary is about eight or nine. Patients will continue to come for this ailment in large numbers, until they can eradicate their chronic constipation by a more balanced diet and by living a more active life. Bone disease, especially osteomyelitis, is rare. Some interesting major fractures came in. One man in particular with a comminuted compound tibia fibula, and simple fracture femur in one limb, gave a surprisingly satisfactory result after six months' immobilisation. Two Kirschner wires were inserted, one in the Os. Calcis and the other in the lower femur and union in true alignment took place with only one inch shortening, which was unavoidable because the com minuted fragments had been removed at the outset of treatment. The patient was last seen walk ing comfortably with a stick a month after leaving hospital. The Braun fracture frame is proving more convenient than the Thomas' Splint. Other operations of note were in the Eye Section, where cataracts and leucomas predominated. Ihe extraction oi cataract by capsulotomy or in the capsule is always a bone of contention abroad. Capsulotomies were more favoured as being a safer operation as regards complications, particularly concerning vitreous loss. Results on the whole were satisfactory, but the real test is how permanently the restored sight remains. Iridectomies are commonly done for leucomata, with good results, and the small coloboma is favoured. As an adjuvant towards restoration of sight in staphyloma, it is distinctly disappoint ing and practically useless. Many chronic staphylomatous eyes were removed and glass eyes inserted two months later. One noteworthy factor in operating on the eye of an Arab is the smallness of the inter-marginal aperture between the two lids even when fully stretched with a speculum. When this is further complicated by fibrosis, due to chronic trachoma, it hampers the manoeuvrability of an operation considerably, and particularly for cataract.

Two thing's of note are the trichiasis operation, and the sub-conjunctival saline injection (S. C. I.) Trichiasis is common particularly of the upper lids and is one of the end results of trachoma. The Anagnostiki method of rectifying' the inturned eyelash is fairly satisfactory. Mucous mem branous grafts have not been used as yet. The S. C. I. in ^c.c. to xic.c. dosages of 6 to 12 per cent hypertonis saline every 4th day, is extremely eilicacious for acute phlyctenular and chronic conjunctivitis, and cpiscelerits, and sometimes for irido-cyclius, and for spring catrrh. INJECTIONS — INOCULATIONS — VACCINATIONS 1.—Injections A total of 1 ,418 quinines were given, mostly intramuscular. 467 intravenous N.A.B.s. were used for syphilis, an average of six to each person. The 352 emetines are a measure of the high incidence of amoebic dysentery in the island. 2.—Inoculations These were for typhoid only. They were all employed prophylactically, chieflly for the medical staff. Some Europeans were also injected, especially after the heavy November rains. Very few cases of typhoid were seen, however, and the chief after result of the floods was to raise the incidence of dysentery. 3.—Vaccinations Only 96 were given in Manama, mostly for school children. A larger number were required in the district, totalling 167, and most of these were on Badaya children who demanded it when the smallpox epidemic was raging in Arabia in November and December. No cases of smallpox were seen in Manama or anv of the outside clinics.

This department is still in its infancy, and, as a glance at the statistics will show, only the simp cr routine tests are carried out with the exception of the Klein's. The few slides examined or malaria were for severe or obscure cases. As a rule the diagnosis speaks for itself without the confirmation of the microscope. The stool examinations comprise a large part of the work, and practically exclusively were ^ or &lt;irnoe ' :, ' c dysentery.Three or four examinations are necessary for each case as a 1 ec to the treatment and to eliminate cyst carriers. As regards the sputums, only suspicious ' aSeS T , Pulm0 ^ tuber culosis were examined for, and 65 per cent were positive. e Klein's lest for syphilis is one of the simpler flocculation tests, and while not fully accurate yet gives a fair enough indication of the presence of active or latent syphilis. It has 0 e remembered though that venereal disease is as much in the blood of the Arab as malaria, lat t e ^reat majority,even though apparently well, are positive cases. he urethral smears for gonorrhoea have been usually taken for chronic cases to verify a f iagnosis. As can be seen most of them were positive. The Schools. Manama, Muharraq, and the boys' college (Kuliya) were all examined within the space of three Jrr-V' Janua 7* . MoSt 0f . the boys attended . an d 492 were seen. Very brief examinations were ie out to eliminate salient diseases. Completely normal cases were well below 50 per cent rachoma was the most serious affection, and the older the boy- so the more advanced stages of cedme manifested. Enlarged spleens as an index of chronic malaria were fewer than expected. ,sea ^ es were not noteworthy, except for skin affections, particularly of the Scalp. Two &lt; ases ot phthysis wer suspected.24 The Kuliya boys were examined in more detail, especially for defective vision, their awiage vision being poor. Five had glasses prescribed for them. I hese boys were the healthiest looking of any, mostly of good families, but only very few had normal eyes. The village schools often attend the bi-weekly dispensaries, especially at Hidd and kila a. Mr. Adrian Vallance, the Director of Education has been doing his utmost lliat every school in the island should have regular medical attention, and as far as possible the medical department has ensured this. Manama and Muharraq send boys daily, but the outlying schools cannot have the same chance as yet. It is realised how important school public health work is, even for the eradication ol trachoma alone. So much regular daily work will be necessary in future in order to raise at all appreciably the standard of health, which cannot be managed now by the Hospital stall, that a full-time school doctor will be imperative. Carefully organised preventive, curative, and follow-up treatment will then come into force, which is the only effective way. Mr. Vallance has been invaluable in stimulating this ideal, and in causing all departments concerned to appreciate this vital matter of school health, which is an index of the future health of the island. Review of the Anti-Malarial Work 1359 (1940) I.—Manama Town. 1. Completion of closure of shallow well scheme in centre of town, with water hydrants to compensate this. 2. The main problem remains untouched until the introduction of a water scheme supplying the whole town with nearby water under good pressure. 3. A water supply scheme to meet this demand is still under discussion. 4. Routine fishing and oiling carried out daily by a Squad of 2 Jemidars and 9 Coolies r the whole town being treated once weekly. II.—Manama Environments-— (one mile radius) 1.—Drainage O/ /o (a) (Jasaibi swamp (b) Fakhroo's garden swamps (c) Sayed Sayed's pools (d) Jufair road pits 2. — Filling In (a) Wireless pool (b) Mission Ousaibia Land 30 success completed June. 90 success completed July. 90 success completed August. 90 success completed January. Still continuing, 3/5 ths completed. Still continuing. A foundation of stone and rubble with a layer of town rubbish and refuse is the method used. A top layer of oiled earth was laid over a considerable area close to the Mission. This, when dr\ has given a good sealed surface. It is recommended in future to be laid over all areas when rubbish has been used to prevent future sewage odours. 3.— Routine 1 islung, oiling, (xaminations of gardens, small drain improvements, inspection of garden tanks, etc., carried out by a squad of 4 Jemadars and 18 Coolies, visiting each place once weekly. III.—Muharraq Island Work commenced in September, 1940, with a squad of 2 Jemidars 8 Coolies under direct daily supervision of one of the anti-malarial experts. Every village has been inspected, and Galali and Basatin were found to be the most needy areas for anti-malarial measures. Hidd town is practically mosquito free. Muharraq itself is not badly infected owing to better drainage s\ stems. Routine work regarding certain shallow wells and drinking pots is important there. The work of the island, as a whole, comprises fishing, oiling and cleaning of channels, and one drainage scheme in Hasatin. Drain commenced December, 1940. The latter has been success fully constructed round the lower and side borders of the Basatin gardens of Siyadi, Shirazi, and Sh. Abdulla. This lateral drain goes straight to the sea with a good flow, and its purpose is to trap all the waste of those gardens, preventing any accumulations on the R.A.F. ground. The drain was completed early this month, and at present shows every promise of fulfilling its purpose, as the small accumulations of water round the R.A.F. well are already slowly diminishing.il%o 25 IV.—Sitra Work commenced here in September, i &lt; j4o . The main six villages have been examined and treated where necessary. The most necessary work is in the gardens, particolarlv round Muhazza, and in the open land of Sufaia where numerous small drains are blocked, disused, or badly constructed. Dilin^, fishing - , filling in of certain pits and ponds, and small drainage work are the chief necessities. A Squad of 2 Jemadars and 12 Coolies is employed. V.—Sakhir, Hadaya.and Jehzirat Nassau Routine anti-malarial measures have been carried out here from time to lime when urgent necessity arose. The 1941 programme will be based on the following lines: — 1. Perseverance of the existing routine work. 2. More propaganda, especially through the radio. 3. Extension of oiling, fishing and garden supervision work up to the Manama—Hapco road bridge (Kawari). 4. An adequate water system in Manama to eradicate any necessity for shallow wells. 5. Special Hems— (1) Continuation to completion of the existing work on the (Jusaibia land and Wireless pool. (2) Final control of the complete date palm area of the north of the island beginning in 194 t (No. 3) and extending over to t ()42 and perhaps 1943. The Anti-Malaria Department 1 hree Indian experts, working with Bahrain Jemadars and coolies, have accomplished a great deal since their arrival in November, 1939. Manama environments, Badaya, Jehzira Nasan, Muharraq island, and Sitra have been the order of sequence of their activities. Notes on this year s work and the proposed 1041 (1360) programme are given, and the chief anti-malaria measures adopted with their varying success can be understood. 1 he Indian staff are young, energetic, and good organisers. The Supervisor is experienced, particularly in small drainage schemes, and is diplomatic with the garden owners. Much has been done, but much remains. Results are speaking for themselves after eighteen months of work, and most people arc now realising their value. Whereas before there have been difficulties over gaining admission to certain houses and gardens for necessary work, now the coolies gangs are very often invited to enter. To have effected this is half the battle, and it is hoped that malaria will be well under control in the whole island after another two years. Conclusion As has been said at the beginning, the Hospital as a complete unit is coming into being. Only the administration block, containing the operating theatres, laboratory, X-Ray department, and ollu'es, remains, which should be completed next year. I he Hospital with its essential departments will then be the mainspring of all medical work, whether in Manama or in the district. Efficient transport and stall will connect all outlving areas with the centre. I his is already slowly being achieved. 1 he whole work depends on the stall, on their interest, reliabilitv, resourcefulness, and elficienc\. Many new men have been enlisted this year, including eight Indian fully trained nurses, three ol whom have arrived. Persians, .and a few Arabs from the mainland have also been enrolled, but it is the Arab of Bahrain who is being used in large numbers—many of them lor dressers-in-training-, ward orderlies, and sweepers. I he greater bulk of the work will always fall on them and so much of it is important. Out of a total stall of sixty-two, thirty-seven are Bahrain subjects, and Miss Harbottle, the Matron, has l)een endeavouring to mould this local material into a routine to which most of them are quite unused. The fair success she has had is entirely due to her perseverance, supervision and discipline. 1 he- local Arab will become the backbone of the department, and this difficult up-hill task, it is hoped, will reap its reward after some years. At present, the Matron has the difficult task of dove-tailing them in to subordinate positions most suitable for them. The Isolation Hospital of 8 beds is an all-Arab department, and will serve this coming vear as an experiment to show whether a high standard of efficiency can be maintained there. H. H. Sheikh Sir Hamad bin Easa Al-Khalifah paid one unofficial visit to the male block, shortl\ alter its completion, and is always showing great interest in the work. Next autumn should see the opening ceremony of the Administrative Block performed by him, when he will then formally declare the whole Hospital as open.26 The chief event of the year has been the opening of the in -patients' blocks for men and women, so that the Bahrain Government Hospital has now come into bein^,. ert \ remains the Administration Block to be finished, before the Hospital as a whole will u comp ete, and this will take place next year. Certain improvement s to the environments &lt;&gt;1 the Hospital, it is hoped, will also come about then, and some garden planning has already bet n dont The Women's Block was olficially opened by Sheikha Ayesha bint Sheikh Ras 11 on ay 28th, 1940 (Rabi Thani 21st, 1359). On June 15th, 1940 (Jamada Awal 10th, 1359) the irst two wards of the Men's Block were taken over and in-patients were admitted. 1 he remaining tirec wards were then utilised as they became available. By the middle of Au^u&gt;t e\&lt;.r\ bee iac Ktn taken up and filled. The Police Hospital was closed for in-patients on June 15th (Jamada Awal 10th) and all its inmates were transferred to the new block. It continued to sei\e its himtion as an out patient centre for the police until December, when a further change was made. 1 lu ( lini( u.ts transferred to the main Hospital Dispensary, and the building was taken over as the bahram (.overnment Isolation Hospital on January 1st, 194 1 (Dilhaj 3rd, I35 &lt; )1 ' &lt;) ' , ' K&gt; ' n -P a, ' u11 &lt;in( ' out P^ient treatment of venereal disease and early cases of of pulmonary tuberculosis. A \ei\ promising field of work, it is hoped, will result from this, because of the widespread nature ol the former disease throughout the island. The scope of the medical work has progressed considerably as the buildings became more and more occupied and the stafi proportionately added to. 1 here was a great increase in opera tions, injections, and laboratory tests, and major operative surgery came into being. I he district work was enlarged with more regular clinics each week, which some of the schools were also able to attend. The Anti-Malaria Department established a routine weekly programme of preventive work for Manama and its near environments, and spread its activities over into Muharraq island, Sitra, and Jehzira Nasan. In conclusion, this has been a year of great change. The dispensary work which previously existed alone is now linked up to a Hospital. Special departments are coming into being, and the outside district work is more and more proving itself a field arm of great value supplying a need. It is very much hoped that gradually the simplest public health matters and methods ot preventing disease will become more known, taken up, and utilised by the people themselves.

When it was reopened in October only children, school girls, and expectant mothers received treatment there. It is hoped that in time a proper child welfare clinic will develop at this clinic. The number of patients treated at Moharraq Dispensary has increased considerably this vear, and the weekly Dispensary at R.ita has maintained its usefulness. A new dispensarv was opened at Suk-Al-Khamis on February 14th. This is a good centre for patients who live in the villatres.

Already they have been well received by the public in their own homes.

The Women's Hospital Her Highness Sheikha Aisha opened the Government Women's Hospital, on May 25th, 1940 (Rabi 1 hani 18th, 1359). The day was eventful and the scene in the outer court yard of the hospital an unusual picture. Hundreds of Arab ladies, covered with their abbas, sat out in the sun, while overhead the red and white flags of Bahrain added colour to the scene, The verandah was crowded with ladies, Arab and European, when Sheikha Aisha made the opening speech, and cut the red and white ribbon across the inner doorway which led to the hospital. All the members of the stalf were present at the opening ceremonv. The next few months taxed our patience waiting for patients. All that can be said is that the door of the hospital has been kept open, and we hope that increasingly people will enter it^ without fear. i he number of in-patients treated in hospital was 280, in seven months.

I he Adviser to the Government attends once a week for appeal cases from the lower court and for hearing important cases. I he number of cases heard during the year was 502 of which 209 were finally settled. The remaindei are not yet disposed of. I he majority of the cases are civil suits, a great proportion of them being land disputes. Several important estate cases were dealt with during the year, including the estates of Isa bin Ahmed Dosri and Shaikh Jasim al-Mehza. 1 he estate cases of Ali bin Sagar and Saad bin Salim Shorugi were finally disposed of. I I k only important criminal case was that of Isa bin Ahmed Algattam who was convicted •ot treason and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. During the year the Head clerk of the Judicial Department, Mr. Abdullah bin Rashid, retired alter about rS years' service. Court fees and fines from all sources amounted to Rs. &lt;j, 151. The Bahrain Small Court. Shaikh Daij bin Hamad Alkhalifah Shaikh Ahmed bin Hamad Alkhalifah Shaikh Mohomed bin Ali Alkhalifah Ihis court deals with civil cases which amount to not more than Rs. 400 and criminal cases ol .m unimpot lant nature. During the year over t , ioo cases were heard of which 740 were finally disposed of. I here is a great difference in the numbers of cases heard by these two courts, which is because cases in the lower court can often be disposed of in one or two hearings and cases in the higher court are longer and more complicated and require many hearings before they can be settled. Most of the cases heard in the Small Court arc maintenance claims and instalment claims agninst divers. Sunni Shara Court. Shaikh Abdullatif bin Saad. Shaikh Abdullatif bin jodr.

There is a certain lack of co-operation between the Bahrain, Minors' Depart ment and the Sunni Shara Court which will be removed when more definite rules governing the last department have been laid down. This matter is under consideration. MUNICIPALITIES The Manamah Municipality.— Revenue ... Rs. 1,13,947 Expenditure ... Rs. 99,180 Finances. —The revenue was slightly more than in the previous year; the expenditure during the last four years has not varied greatly. The main sources of revenue are the Government subsidy, house and shop taxes, and the share of the vehicle tax which is collected by the Govern ment. The chief items of expenditure were on town cleaning and mending and opening up new roads through the ba/ar. The cash balance of the municipality at the end of the year was approximately Rs. 47,000. In the budget for 1360 revenue amounting to Rs. 1 ,01,000 is anticipated. Xeiv Roads. —Work done during the year included opening up a new road through the bazar from east to west for which 49 shops were partly demolished and 6 were entirely removed. The road makes part of the bazar, which used to consist of narrow lanes, accessible to motor traffic. Several other streets were widened and a number of corners were improved by partial removal of buildings. New roads were marked out, and in some cases constructed, on the open land south of Manamah which is the only direction in which the town can expand. The new roads are wide and straight and divide the open land into sections which are sub-divided by smaller roads.I 31 Anfi-ntcilaria measures and reclatnation. —Much reclamation work was done in the low-lying' ground south-east of Mananiah town. Depressions were filled with stone covered with town rubbish and oiled sand; the pool on the south-west of the town was considerably reduced in size bv filling it with stones and earth. The municipality, under the supervision of the State Engineer, ■carried out the work of linking together several artesian wells and provided additional water points in areas where no water supply existed. Several new drains were built, including one through the Nairn district which became necessary to carry away flood water after the abnormal rains. The Secretary of the Municipality and his siafi co-operated effectively with the Medical Department in carrying out anti-malaria measures in Manamah. In addition to the ordinary routine work of the municipalitv, such as removing refuse, cleaning the markets, abattoir services, supervising food, shops, etc., the Municipalitv carried out work on behall of the Government on the Manamah—Muharraq sea road terminal, and in building a drain from the swamp south-ctist of the town to the sea-shore at Houra. The council, under the presidency of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Al-Khalifah, met 17 times ■during the year and sub-committees carried out 26 inspections. The Muharraq Municipality.— Revenue ... Rs. 59,825 Expenditure ... Rs. 48,50*) Most of the Municipality's work consisted of routine duties, such as town cleaning, super vision of food markets, repairing roads, and upkeep of municipal property. 1 he road from the pier to His Highness Shaikh Hamad's house was widened by cutting a number of houses. It is now possible for two cars to pass in most parts of the road. 1 he electric supply was extended along tin* sea road extension as far as the boys school at Busaiteen. I he road itself was built by the Municipality with a special grant from the Govern ment. It reduces the motor tralfic inside the town and makes the other parts of Muharraq island more easily accessible. I he Municipality receives a small extra grant for carrying out work in Hedd where there js no independent municipalitv. Shia Wakf Department I he revenue of the department was Rs. 17,855, about Rs. 5,000 less than during the previous year. 1 he total expenditure was Rs. 20,000. Approximately Rs. 8,000 was spent on the Matems, Rs. 3 ,300 on repairs to mosques, Rs. 3,7°° on repairs to wakf properties, and Rs. 1 ,500 on charities. At the end of the year the department had a balance of approximately Rs. 4,000. I here was no change in the wakf committee during the year but there will be a re-election during 1360. I he Shia Wakf Department has now become a securelv established institution and there no longer exists any opposition to its activities. 1 he Sunni wakfs are still administered directly by the Sunni Oadis. It has not vet been possible to create a committee and a regular organisation for dealing with them. EDUCATION Report by Mr. C. R. L. Adrian Vallance, M.A., Director of Education. The year 1359 been one of considerable progress in the sphere of Government Education, ftnd some of the many charges and reforms carried out during the period can be summarised as follows: — I he working hours of both masters and boys have been rationalised. The pav and conditions ol teachers have been regularised. Grades of teachers have been defined, permantent rates of pa} have been fixed, and annual increments have been introduced. All teachers, except village mullas, have been made participators in the Government Provident Scheme. A central store for books, stationery, and equipment has been established at the Education Dllice. Payment by the pupils themselves for books and stationery has been abolished, thus remov ing the previous insuperable bar to the proper education of poor bovs. Arab dress for masters and boys alike, in all the schools except the Technical School, has been made obligatory. 1 he age of admission to the lowest classes of the schools has been raised from 4, or 6 to nearer to 8 than 7.' The over-aged young men and the married men who formerly monopolised 'he upper classes of the schools have been weeded out altogether. Rules for the elimination of ■excessively dull boys from the educational system have been devised.aj The use of the Qur'an as a means of teaching inlants to rratl has bri n lorbuUlin, and pr \ infants' reading-books have been introduced into all the schools, I'rupii i«&gt;p&gt; books art nt \\ for the teaching' of handwriting. The use of lead-pencils has been abolishid. Slatis (owing paper shortage) are used by all the infants' classes, and ink by evn \ om «Ise. Beating in the schools has been restricted and regularised, and is now adminisii it d of bad conduct alone, never for lack t&gt;f ability. A number of well-qualified masters have been engaged, including ~ I riU st inians, , . \ i i.ti and several of the better-educated Bahrainis. Nearly all the classes in ilu largt m hools, were badly over-crowded, have been divided into two, and no class now tontains mon than 30 lx)vs. With better teaching, smaller classes, and modern methods, all the luadmasUrs art iindmg thai the younger bovs are making rapitl progress, while the oldei t&gt;nt s .tit pro^rt ssing ( ompara tively slowly, owing to their almost complete lack ol previous towndation, 01 grtmndin^. 1 his state of affairs was predicted in the Report on (Government Education in Bahrain, t&gt;l Septem ber, 1939, where it was stated that the full lesults ol the policy which it was pioposttl to introdiut would not be seen until several years had elapsed. The four village schools of Budayyi', Rufa', Sit rah, and Suk al-Khamis have been completely transformed. A year ago they were simply small mulla schools, containing no books except copies of the Qur'an, and teaching nothing except Religion, and, at two ot the schools, simple Addition of Figures. To-day each of the four schools contains at least two competent teat lit is and ton- sists of several separate classes, using proper books and learning Reading, W riting, and Arith metic. The mullas have been retained for the teaching of Religion alone, which is now restricted to one hour daily, for every boy. The numbers in all four schools have risen steadily. Bud.i\)i School has been very considerably enlarged, and Rufa' School has added an extia classroom. Suk al-Khamis and Sitrah are in urgent need of smilar extension, which it is hoped to cany out in the near future. All the village schoolboys have learned to play iootball. The small Girls' School at Rufa', which was started with a single girl, reached the number of 33 pupils before the end of the year, and has now been put in the charge ot female teachers. Daily phvsical drill is now given to all boys, in all the schools, and the large schools of Manamah, Muharraq, and Hidd plav organised games, under the instruction of a qualified games- master. Scouting has been allowed to die a natural death: it had never been carried out on organised lines. All the Government schools in the island have now been brought into a thorough state ol repair. The work has taken a full year to complete. Manamah College (The Kullivah) has been opened, and with its inauguration all the C lasses above Class 6 at the other schools were closed down. The other schools are now Hrst and Second Stage schools onlv, with the Kullivah the sole P inal Stage school. I he new Kulliyah is designed to accommodate the pick, intellectually, of all the boys leaving the other schools at the age ot or 14, and not passing on into the 1 echnical School. Its object is to provide higher education and character-training for those of the Bahrain schoolboys who arc destined later on to become Government servants and Government schoolmasters and to obtain employment with commercial firms. The course is to be one of three years, and the normal annual entry will be about 33 boys, making about a hundred when the school is full. The instruction is given in English, and the ages of the boys now in the school range from 13 to 15. In spite of their lack of good grounding, considerable progress has already been made with the education of these specially selected boys. The school contains half-a-dozen boarders, which is a new thing for Bahrain. All the boys at the Kullivah, except 3 who have state scholarships, pay fees for their education. The Technical School continues to be a source of satisfaction. Prejudice against entering it has now been completely broken down; the present small school is full to overflowing, and there is a long list of applications which cannot be satisfied. Seven fee-paying boys have been sent to the School from Kuwait, and there are enquiries from other parts of the Gulf. Two new and well -qualified instructors have been appointed for the Mechanics Section, both Syrians with good experience. The carpentry Section remains highly ellicient and has been turning out really well- made furniture for the schools, the State Hospital, and for private customers. Towards the end of the vear orders for furniture to the value of over Rs. 4,000 were received.33 At the bejfinning (.&gt;1 tin* yi'ar undtT revM'vs the (jovrrnivu-nt rccfivrd the Report on Technical Education in Kahrain (^MTipiled by Mr. &lt;». K k Hufvhin^s, F.G.S., Principal of the Baghdad Terhniral School, who had visited Bahrain during the previous month in order to studv the question on the spot, this excellent and exhaustive document, which was complete with plans and specifications for a greatly enlarged Technical School, reeeived hitrh praise when shewn to Mr. M. 1 hornbur^, ilvt 1 \ ice President of the Bahrain I'etroleum Company, for whose service the majority ot our I echnical St^hool boys are bein^j' trained, the (lovernment adopted the repf»rt and approved,with a few minor modifications, the plans for building, and work on the new school was eventually started. One lar ^e wing is now almost ready for occupation. Towards the cik ! of the year, in view Of the expansion of its fechmcal tramiiii^ si-beme and the increasing demand for places in the new school, the Government decided to provide it with a first-Hass British Principal, and negotiations to that end are now proceeding-. A special class for shaikhs of the Ruling Family was opened early in the year, instruction being given in Arithmetic, Arabic, and English. Nineteen shaikhs enrolled, and at first the attendance was good, but as the novelty wore ofi' attendance steadily declined, and now only a few come regularly to the classes. Their almost total lack of previous schooling, combined with their age, makes their instruction extremely difficult, and in some cases almost impossible. The shaikhs are, however, now very much keener on sending their own sons to the Government schools than they were even a year ago, and if this continues it will mean that illiteracy amongst the Ruling Family will eventually disappear. During ihe year the teaching stalls of the boys' schools have voluntarily contributed Rs. i.ooo towards the purchase of fighter aeroplanes for the British forces. With the appointment by the Government of Dr. R. H. B. Snow as State Medical Officer tlu health position in the Government schools has greatly improved. All of them are now regularlv visited by Dr. Snow or his assistants, and thorough medical examinations, followed by treatment, ha\e been c.inied oui at the Kulliyah and at the large schools of Manamah and Muharraq. The State Medical Ofhcei has energetically tackled the problem of eve-disease, with good results, one ol which is that the boys are now beginning to take an intelligent interest in their own eyesight, and to seek medical help when they need it. Talks on health are now given in the schools, and a thousand copies of a small treatise on malaria have been passed on to their homes by the boys, after previous careful explanation of the subject by the teachers in the classrooms, lowards the end of the year the Government decided upon the appointment of a special school doctor, to work under the State Medical Officer, and steps are now being taken to find a suitable man. Ihe above is a brief account of what has been effected during the past year; but it must be emphasisted that we are at present only at the beginning of our main task, which is the improvement of Government education in Bahrain. What has now been provided is little more than the framework necessary to a successful scheme of education: the standard of education ifself, though improving daily, is still very low, and this only time can remedy. In every school in the Island the numbers have risen, but this has only too often been due to the private efforts of th( new headmasters, who are anxious to shew results. We are gradually succeeding in imprt ssing upon their minds the fact that numbers are of no importance whatever, when compared with the quality of the instruction given.— School Regisiered Regular Attend a nts Manamah College ... 27 27 Manamah School ... ^86 ^00 Muharraq School ... 288 2^5 Hidd School ... ij-2 Budayyi' School ... 72 Rufa' School ... ^7 -H Sit rah School ... -- ,8 Suq-Al-Khamis School ... iot 75 Technical School ... 35 ^- Tot al 1.233 973u FEMALE EDUCATION The work of the Governnunt girls' schools proceeded steadily throughout the year. N'o new schools were opened but the question of starting a school in Rafaa was considered. In Manamah there was a large increase in the number of pupils, most of the new girls being under ten years old. At the end of the year the number of girls in the Manamah school was 243; about one quarter are foreign and the remainder are Bahrain subjects. The girls in the Manamah school are rep resentative of all classes, from the richest to the poorest. The stall' consists of one Syrian head mistress and nine local teachers. The health of the children has definitely improved owing to the regular daily attendance at the school of one of the Government nurses. At Muharraq the progress has been satisfactory, though fewer new pupils entered the school at the beginning of the year. The standard of education at Muharraq is higher than in Manamah which is due in a large measure to the keenness of the headmistress and the help which she gives to the teachers. The number of pupils at the end of the year was 161, of whom only 17 wore foreigners. Many of tin- daughters of the Ruling Family attend the Muharraq girls' school. 1 he staff consists of one Syrian headmistress, one Syrian assistant mistress, and six local teachers. The Muharraq Government Nurse attends the school twice weekly. The subjects taught in the two schools are, in general, the same but in Muharraq there arc classes in cooking and dressmaking. Sewing and embroidery are very popular both with the girls and the parents and the older girls now produce first-rate work. This is shown in an exhibi tion in the schools at the end of each term. In Hidd school there was a slight decrease in the number of pupils owing to epidemics ol measles and whooping -cough, and also because some of the parents, who in Hidd arc ultra con servative, disapproved of the medical visits which were carried out by the Government lady doc.or. One of the Muharraq nurses now visits the school weekly. 1 here wen (14 pupils .it the year and a staff consisting of three local teachers. MINORS' DEPARTMENT The Minors' Department, which consists of a committee under the president v o . iai 1 Sulman bin Hamad Alkhalifah with a superintendent and clerical staff, continued and extende it. work during the vear in spite of a certain amount of opposition from the Sunm (Jadis and a few interested persons. At the end of the year it published a report of its work in the local news paper. It deal! with funds amounting to Rs. 95.000 and undertook the administration ot 17 new estate. Debts due to estates were recovered without recourse to courts and 119 orp inns were maintained from the proceeds of their property under the department's administration. Loan, were made at 10 per cent interest secured by property or gold ornaments. Several persons who were not minors approached the department and asked that the pr.v perties which thev inherited should he administered on their behall by the department. \t the end of the vear the Sunni Shara Court became involved in a disagreement with the Bahrain Court relating to the administration of estate, which affected the Minors Department. The Qadis produced a ruling on the subject which wa. issued by the Bahrain Government about ,, year, ago before the Minors' Department was established, and contended that conditions to-day were the same as they were then and that the Shara only was responsible lor minors. This point of view was not accepted by the Government. . , , ,i„ The Minors' Department is doing much valuable work and it it had existed longer the scandalous misappropriation of the properties of minors and widows, which is well known to have taken place in the past, would not have been possible. The activities ol this department could well be extended to protect the rights of all minors, whether they apply lor adniin.stration &lt;„ not but this is not practicable until the department is more thoroughly established. The following is a summary of lln- revenue and expenditure ot the department lor the V ' 1359 : Summary of Revenue and Expenditure of the Minors^ Department REVENUE. bXPtJNUl I UKK.

A quantity of Kuropean vegetables were ^rown in the garden and sold in the vegetable bazar but it was found difficult to ^et good prices for them. Potatoes were successfully grown and sold well. The heavy rain in the autumn caused much of the garden to be flooded and all the first sowing of vegetable seeds was destroyed. The most profitable crop is still lucerne which grows well and easily can be sold at all times of the year. Barley was planted in the open ground below Rafaa and in a sheltered valley near Safra. I he crop was fairly successful; though it did not attain a good height it produced heads of corn which were of fair size. Ihe herd of white Rath cattle, many of them prizewinners, which were purchased from Alwar State arrived during the year. As a temporary measure they were kept at Budeya. They are considerably larger than the local cattle and the cost of their food is expensive. It is not yJt possible to give a definite opinion of their milking qualities but it appears that the Rath cows continue in milk for a very much longer time than the Bahrain cows and it is possible that they will show a greater annual yield of milk. His Excellency the Viceroy presented His Highness Shaikh Hamad with a prize Sindi bull lor breeding purposes. Ihe local cattle are of two types: one is said to have been introduced from India, the other from Arabia. Experiments are being made by crossing the local cows with the Sindi bull, but it will be some years before the results will be known. The public show some reluctance in bringing their cows to be served by the bull mainly because they think that he is too heavy. There is a steady increase in the amount of new land which is being put under cultivation both near Manamah and on the coast especially between Zellaq and Saddad. Almost all the new cultivation consists of lucerne, dates, and local vegetables which the public find more profitable to grow than European vegetables and otberg*crops which last only for a few months of the year. No more artesian wells have been sunk and this restriction has reduced the extension of cultiva tion. It is a restriction that was very necessary owing to the apparent sinking of the water level. In several areas, especially in the gardens at Burri, the natural springs have decreased so must that some of the date gardens are dying for lack of water. The gardens in low-lying areas have not yet been seriously affected. PASSPORT DEPARTMENT Ihe revenue from passports, etc., amounted to Rs. 14,000. This sum is only slightly more than the cost of maintaining the department, and it is likely that the revenue will decrease in 1360. Fhe passport department maintains records of all persons entering and leaving Bahrain and supplies detailed lists and statistics to the Bahrain Government and to other officials. During the year 14,475 passengers arrived in Bahrain, of whom 3,219 were steamer pas sengers; 10,997 came in native craft and 259 by air. The Bahrain Government permitted Iranian divers, who dived with and were indebted to Bahrain nakhudas, to visit Bahrain for the diving season without obtaining regular travel docu ments. There is still a large influx of Iranians into Bahrain; many of them are destitute and come seeking employment. These persons frequently land off lonely parts of the coast and, after swim ming ashore, make their way to Manamah. Numbers of Arabs from Qattar enter the country in •1 similar way, although the number has decreased since the mounted police patrols are on duty a ' 0 ng the coast. During fhe year ^7 prosecutions were instituted by the department against persons who had entered the country unlawfully. The police and the passport department co operate well in efforts to prevent illegal entry of undesirable aliens. The following were among the important visitors to Bahrain during the year: The Hon'ble Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieut.-Colonel C. G. Prior, c.i.e. His Excellency A1 Signor G. B. T rinwnzi, Bishop of Gaza. His Excellency Pail Knabexshi e, United States Minister at Baghdad. His Royal Highness Prince SaVo bin Abdilaziz, Crown Prince of Sa'udi Arabia. Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid, Ruler of Ajman. Shaikh Sa'id bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai. Shaikh Abdulaziz Al-Mo'ammek, Amir or Taif.m BAHRAIN NATIONALITY Uurin K the year 45 p- isons applied to become Bahrain subjects ami ol these 27 were e ranled Bahrain natinnaiity. Most ot the applicants were Iranians ami Iraqis. I he latter were nmM y lews The Iranians included several leading merchants and shopkeepers. ' The necessary oualitications include residence in Bahrain for not less than .0 years posses- sjnn of immoyeahle property, and a clean poli.e record. Most of the persons whose apphcat.ons were refused did not own property in Halnain. CENSUS OF BAHRAIN Until the year . W no census of (he population of Bahrain had been made. Various handbooks such as Whittaker's Almanac, the Statesman's Year Book, encyclopedias etc. slated t 1a it number of the inhabitants of Bahrain was from 130,000 to 150,000. 1 hese li^urcs urn- mm&lt; upon rou^h estimates which have proved to be incorrect. For several vears the Government of Bahrain contemplated holding: a census, and in 1358 His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad, in his public speech on the occasion of h.s access,on anniver sary, announced that a census was goin R to he held during the comii&gt;B i™'- '35&lt;&gt; copies ol the Baluchistan Census Report for 1931 and other census reporls were obtained and Mm h It was realised that the quantity of detailed information contained in other census reports . ould not at present he obtained in Bahrain, where the very idea of a census was unheard o ,&gt; c majority of the people without causing alarm and agitation among the ignorant public. g once held a census in Bahrain more questions could be asked and more statistics ohtaimd at some future date when the public realised that holding a census did not involve am ol the measures which they anticipated when the first census was held. At various times during die months before the census was held, rumours, which were sometimes deliberately cir. ula ed, became current that Hie object of the tlovernment was to enlist all able-bodied men foi mihtary service abroad, to impose various forms of taxation, to set up mumcppalit.es in every town anil village and to impose some kind of compulsory medical inspections, and at one time it was even suggested that the Government wished to collect and destroy certain communities. The object of the census and the methods by which it would he carried out were explained to the public at numerous large meetings presided over by the Sum., and Shia Qadis and byte senior shaikhs, he talks from tbo broadcasting station, and in schools; by art.cles ... the loea newspaper ami by thousands of notices and band-bills which were distributed m every town and village in Bahrain. His Highness himself and many of the rulmg lam.ly explained tie ma their tenants and to resident bedouins who as a community regarded the census w.th more sus- ptcion than the local inhabitants. In every town and village census counters were appointed and each was accompanied by one of the leading men of the village. In Manamah, Muharraq, and Hedd the counters were Govern- ment and Municipal employees, each man dealing as far as possible with the dis r.e, in wl lived. In the three towns, as well as in the villages, a leading resident from each ■ accompanied the counters and gave them valuable help. The census ol the Bahra.n I Urol u* Company was deal, with by the eompam s staff and some of the independent such as the American Mission, the Naval Base, etc., were counted by the head ol the com, who filled in the forms which were provided by the Government. All the registers, lorms and notices were printed locally and the preliminary details were filled in by the counters some before the actual census and were checked and exammfd before the counting look P'' 1 ' . of the work of organising the census, enlisting the counters, dtv.dmg the towns ,nto , . • and finally checking and recording the results was done by the Land Department under the supervision of the Superintendent, Khan Sahib Mohomed khahl Memon. Theeensus was held on the night of a4th Dil Hijjah 1359 corresponding to «ml januai? to,, and on that night all coftee-shops and public places of an.usen.ent rema.n«l closed I several hours. Taxis, with the exception of a few for which special arrangement, were made order to cover any emergency, ceased to ply and the public were asked to remain .n thc.rh^ ■n,, ^...pl.. eooperated admirably; on that night the town ot Manamah appeared to be entin^ .leserted exeep, for the census counters who passed through the streets with their lanterns books The counting look place without any dilVa ulty both in (he towns and m the villages.87 I he numerical results which were obtained were, in my opinion, very accurate, but some of the other details were rather vague. The question of a^es, as an example, was difficult to ascertain. In most cases people were classed as adults or minors but in the case of women all unmarried women are locally classed as minors, irrespective of their ages. There is no registra tion of vital statistics in Bahrain and 90 per cent of the people do not know their own age. Questions which would supply information for statistics to be made relating to marriage, age, families, etr., could not be asked in Bahrain, where the majority of people would resent being cross-questioned about such matters. Now that a census has been held further details could be more easily obtained when at some future date another census is held. The census returns supplied the following information: The total population Number of stone houses, amaras, and shops Number of saf houses Males or females Literate or illiterate Nationality and Religion. The total population of Bahrain amounted to 89,970 persons, of whom 27,835 lived in Manamah and 17,775 ' n Muharraq. A separate report will be written giving the results of the census with full details. The more •educated members of the public took a great interest in the census but all of them predicted that the result would show a very much larger population than the number which was arrived at.Roads flooded during unusually heavy winter rains.hloods. During the winter of 1359 there was an abnormally heavv rainfall which causttl serious Hoods and considerable damage to (iovernment and private buildings. The floods were most serious in the low-lying' suburbs of Manamah where the main roads and hundreds of saf houses remained several feet under water for a week or ten days. In other places, especially in Ifedd, numbers of houses built of stone and mud collapsed; in some cases on the heads of their owners. About a dozen people were killed and many others were injured. In Hedd manv »f the inhabitants left their houses and lived for the time being in their boats. Much of the work which had been done during the vear under the anti-malaria scheme was rendered useless; land which had been reelaimed and swamps wViich had been filled in became sheets of water. 1 here was distress among the poorer people of Manamah and when the floods began to go down conditions made it appear likely that the floods would be followed by epidemics. However, they did not oecur. I he (lovernment took all possible steps to alleviate the distress of the people. Funds were provided by the (iovernment, with a contribution from His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad to. compensate people whose houses had been damaged. A number of families were temporarily housed in His Highness's house near the Fort and on the ground floor of the palace. Drains were dug through the town to the sea from the south-west side of the town and from the south- cast which eventually carried away much of the flood water. .\ large number of saf houses on Government land in the western quarter of Manamah were removed to higher ground near the Fort at Government expense and steps were taken to oil the flood-water to prevent extensive breeding of mosquitoes. I he drains which were dug are to be permanently built and the effect of the new drains will reduce the flood water which collects every year during the rainv season, even when the amount of rain is normal, in the low-King land round Manamah. Death of Shaikh Jasim ami Haj Ahdv Ali bin Rejah. I he death occurred towards the end of the year of Shaikh Jasim bin Meh/a who for many years was the Sunni (Jadi of Bahrain. Hi- retired from his post about fourteen vear-ago when he became blind. Shaikh Jasim was a notable religious judge whose reputation was well known in all' parts of the (iiilf. He was a contemporary of Shaikh Isa bin Ali, the late ruler of Bahrain and his age at the time of his death appears to have been about 100. Haji Abdu Ali bin Kejab, who died during the year, was for manv vears recognised as the leading man of the Bahama. He was a pearl merchant by profession and, although quite illiterate, he owned a number of pearling dhows. In his day he was one of the wealthiest and the most influential men in Bahrain but latterly he fell on evil days having lost all his monev and his property owing to the depression in the pearl industry. Bahrain Broadcasting Station. —The broadcasting station was opened bv His High ness Shaikh Hamad on 3rd Shawaal 1359 (4th November 1940). It is controlled by the Publicity Officer, a member of the staff of the Political Agency, Bahrain. It has been of value to the Government of Bahrain as a means of publishing information on current matters such as talks on antimalaria measures, census arrangements etc. The value of the broadcast is limited because apart from people who listen to it in a few coffee-shops it is only heard bv owners of wireless sets in Manamah and Muharraq. Owners of wireless sets an- a small proportion of the population. 1 isit of U.K.11. the Amir Sa'ud. —The Amir Sa'ud spent several days in Bahrain on his way to and from India, in the spring. He was accompanied bv a number of relations and followers. The Amir and his party were the guests of His Highness Shaikh Hamad. Shaikh Mohotned bin Isa Alkhalifah in Malta. —At the outbreak of the war with Italy, Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa Alkhalifah, who was on his way back to Bahrain from Egypt, on an Italian boat, was taken to Malta where he stayed for about two months until arrangements were made for him to leave the island. Shaikh Mohomed's visit to Malta coincided with the beginning of the Italian air attacks on that island. He eventually returned by air to Jedda and thence by the land route through Saudi Arabia to Bahrain. Air Attack on Bahrain. —On 17th Kamadhan 1359 (October 19, T()4o) bombs were dropped the neighbourhood of the refinery by Italian aeroplanes. No damage was done to persons or property but the attack eaused general indignation and anger among the Arabs in Bahrain and in other parts of the Arab world. Papal Insignia bestowed on His Highness Shaikh Haniad. The Roman Catholic Church, fur which His Highness Shaikh Hamad granted a piece of ground, was opened during the year. His Highness Shaikh Hamad received from His Holiness the Pope the order of Chavelier of the Order of San Sabastian.40 ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT I.—Electricity Department, Units generated lor the year 1359 showed an increase of 41,554 over 1358. Units sold and used on works for the year 1359 showed an increase of 38,321 over 1358. I his was due to extra load amounting- to approximately 71 k.w. The nature of the new load connected during 1359 was as follows: — K.W Lighting and fans (786 points) ... 34-° Power: Motors and Jufair wireless set 4 .0 Heaters and heating appliances ... 10 .0 A.C, plant (A.L.O.'s Residence) .,. 5'° Refrigerators 1 .0 A.C.

Increase Rs. 3,540/5, The increase is small in comparison with past years, and is due to the following: — (a) Lighting restrictions (imposed under Defence Regulations). (b) A reduction was made in the price of electricity for lighting and fans (one anna per unit), thereby reducing the annual income from this source by Approximately Rs, 11 ,000, 170 premises were connected during 1359, as follows: — In Manamah ... 153 In Muharraq ... 17 Total consumers connected to date, 1 ,509. Maximum load recorded 180. total kilowatts connected to date 618 k.w. Capacity of generating plant, including standby, 400 KVA. Wiring Contracts.— I he local wiring contractors continued wiring in the State during 1359. Premises wired ^vere as follows: — 1. Hv Haji Salman Abduila Zayani ... 56 2. By Mr, Vousuf Khalil Al Moayed ... 12 3. By Messrs, Koohiji Bros, ... ... 44 4. By Haji Abdul Rahman Mohd.

Government Hospital — Male Nurses' Quarters. Additional street lighting at Manamah and Muharraq Towns. The otlice of the Pier Clerk (Manamah). And a few other small premises. Temporary Wiring.— No temporary illuminations took place in 1359, owing to the political situation. Main Extensions.— The L. T, line from Qudhaibia sus-station to Jufair was converted to H, T, (3,^00) during the year 1359, and a new H, T, sub-station built at Jufair to deal with the increased load. The cost of the line and sub-station was borne by the Admiralty. An extension of the Sea Road lighting in Muharraq was carried out, and consi^oeed of thirteen poles, and a three phase line. The cost was met by the Muharraq Baladiya,( 41 Air Conditioning.— I he following residences were equipped with units for the summer of 1359: — Units. H. B. M.'s Political A^ent ... ... ^ C.

Six more units have been ordered to meet Government demands in 1360. Several other units have been ordered by private users. II.—Government Telephone Department. Fhe number of subscribers connected to date is 88, and applications for connection continue to be received. 1 he new fifty line exchange ordered at the beginning of the year is not yet to hami, due to shipping delays, but is expected within the next few months. The Government Hospital was equipped with a temporary domestic exchange to interconnect sections of the Hospital. A new 20 line board has been ordered for this pi?pose. Several other concerns were equipped with private boanls to deal with their local distribu tion (such as Jufair Naval Base, British Overseas Air Corporation, and Mason Memorial Hospital, etc.). Tenders have been asked for in connection with multi-core underground telephone cable, and multi-core centenary cables with a view to replacing the present bare overhead lines, in certain sections of the town. I his would assist to release the mechanical strain on existing - poles, as well as to improve telephone reception. The exchange wiring, which had deteriorated through damp, etc., has been renewed as opportunity served. JH.—Transport Department. The usual servicing of Government vehicles was carried out during the year. The number of services done being 1,037. IV.—Fire Section. A number of small fires were extinguished by the Fire Section during the vear. No major fires occurred. V.—Traffic Section. I he State Engineer's Department continued to carry out the registration of all the motor U'hicles in the State (five hundred and thirteen vehicles) and the testing of brakes, lights, speeds, itc., in accordance with the Bahrain Government Motor Vehicle Proclamation of 1357. I he licensing (and re-licensing) of all drivers was also carried out bv this Department, 80 drivers being examined during 1359, out of whom 45 passed. License-holders for all motor vehicles were obtained from England and fitted to wind screens 'n the usual manner, and each taxi driver was given a numbered disc to wear. More danger and directional traffic signs (fitted with reflex lenses) have been erected at suitable points, such as dangerous cross roads, concealed turnings, etc., in the town of Manamah. VI.—Oil Royalty and other Gauging. 1 he whole of the oil produced by the Bahrain Petroleum Company's field, amounting to 941,204 tons, was gauged and sampled by this Department, also 40 cargoes of refined oil amount- 'ng to 288,794 tons, were sampled and tested for the Bahrain Petroleum Company. All the crude oil shipped from CASOC to Zellaq and Sitra, Bahrain, was gauged, amounting to tons.V &gt; v.. .

I nfortunateb the steamers'' service has become irregular, and decreased owing to the ex.genc.es ot Naval requ.rc- n.ents; and consequently a verv considerable quantity of goods intended lor Bahratn has not eon, forward from India, which resulted in less duty being collected.

It must be remembered that Hal,ram ,s dependent Java for Its supplies of the above foodstuffs; and the increased cost ol these speculation at the original markets, and partly to the increase in the charges tor freight and insurance, which may be put at twenty-five per cent above pre -war .ales. ^ ^ Another important factor in local conditions which has developed owm^ t : r mirclias es suspension of credit on terms by the original sellers, local importers now obtaining then l'' r 1,3 ' on die 'cash and earn' basis; and in general all goods must be paid for before sh.pmcnt. 1 he effect of this position 'is that local business can only be done by wealthy firms havmg adequate capital to dispense with the need for en.lit facilities. Consequently the smal .mportcr is in proc s of being eliminated fro,,, this kind of business and developmg mto a local wholesaler. Also the Fo^d Control of selling prices, by limiting profits, operates to prevent the smal dealer ron amassing capital at the expense of the poor consumers; and the ultimate effect w '' be '^ffi'icn Stocks arc adjusting themselves to local needs. This is to the good, providing that a sulhucn margin of stock i. conserved to meet the contingency of fewer cargo steamers servmg tins port. This increase in cost is most noticeable in the case of nee. I he reduction the quant. &gt; of Wheat imported mav also be traced to the economic conditions in Iraq where ,ts pnee ro.se so hid, that none was exported. In the case of tea, the reduction m quantity is due to a consirk e f , ..., exnorts of this commoditv. It is thought, also, that the imports of coffee will decrease 1 because the mainland of Arabia has' found it cheaper to import much of its coffee through ?h' ™Tt of Kuwait. There is now no trade in loaf sugar from Europe; and the soft sugar ,s preferred to the crystal sugar because it is cheaper and quite as good; hut here again the ig. prices have reduced the quantities imported.49 Vartl Receipts : —Cohsidcratibn of flu- qU4ntitU S Imported, as show,- abov., will ct»mri1tKlities: — Veaf 135H. 4 ,08 ,300 owls.

These craft bring JO Bahrain fish oil for re-conditioning local craft, ami chundals for use in building construction In 1358 the demand for fish oil was slight, as stocks had not been used up, and the number of craft re-cond.tipned for the pearling banks was less. In 1351, there was more local activitv in building, and consequently the demand for /rfjundals increased. Also to be noticed is the decrease in visits of mainland craft, which is said to be due partly ti&gt; ' d wh,ch exercises a very close supervision upon the quantities it permits to be exported, and partly due to the admission of Kuwait imports into Saudi-Arabia, such goods- proceeding by caravan, instead of by sea. 2. -I earhng Licenses:—In 1356, in view of the poor pearling seasons, the rate of collections ' n 1 ear,,n «' Llcense * was halved; but the amount of (he Budget Estimate, Ks. 34,500, remained unchanged. This estimate was reduced in ,358 to Rs. .4,500, and in ,359 to Rs. &gt;0,000; yet the collections of Rs. 11,352 showed a decrease of Rs. 8,648. if the estimate had been halved down to Rs. 17,250 the decrease would have been Rs. 5,898, a fact which clearly indicates the present position of the pearling industry. 3.—Craft Licenses:—For the year 1359 the Budget estimate of collections from Craft Rcgistra- non was Rs. 2,000, while the actual collections were Rs. 2,411. This cncss over the Budget, lowever, becomes a deficit of Rs. 313 when compared with the actual collections for the year 1358. During the past year, in view of the fact that the month of registration, Rajab, fell during the pearling season, it was thought fairer to the owners, in view of the previous year's exper ience, to renew the registrations earlier than Rajab where convenient, in order to save the owners of pearling craft the penalties for late renewals. This method proved successful, and will be repeated in 1360; but the amount collected became less than the previous year because fewer owners had to pay late fees. Also, unfortunately, there were fewer craft to be renewed, as is shown in the following table: — Registered craft at end of 1358 Newly built in 1359 Foreign craft newly registered Converted launches Steam tug, new Steam tug, old Converted sailing craft Less. —I n 1359— Sold abroad Broken up Built for sale abroad Removed abroad Confiscated abroad Lost at sea Stolen from the port Small fishing boats found unseawofthv Launch converted to sail Total ...

During the past year, the T-piece at the head of the extension was badly battered by stormy seAs on several occasions, and ha&lt; had to In- repaired.52 The service of these two lines is of vital importance to the life of this State; since the B.I.S.N. Coy., Ltd., brings all the foodstuffs of the State imported from India, while the Strick- Ellerman I.ine brings here all the British exports to Bahrain. The exigencies of the war have transferred many of these steamers for service in other directions; and, while it is believed that the steamship companies are making every effort to maintain iheir service to the State, yet this reduced and irregular service gives cause for uneasiness among ihe merchants, which is reflected in reduced imports. It must not be forgotten that native craft can ply between Bahrain and Indian^ ports only in the winter-time on account of the south-western monsoon; and consequently such craft can be relied upon to bring only a proportion of the foodstuffs needed by this State. This fact, therefore, gives cause for careful consideration of the local situation and its needs for the immediate future. From the above number of tankships' visits i( will be surmised that the activity in oil pro duction has been very considerable. The quantity of crude oil imported from Saudi—Arabia for refinement in Sitrah during 1359 was 11 ,44,497 barrels, all of which, by special arrangement, is admitted free of duty.

Bahrain. This is largely due to the working of the 'optional system ' which although, owing to the exigencies of war, this system ts subject to the 1-ood C on.ml gives preference to the needs of this Slate before permitting exports. In view of the successful working of the Optional System, it was decided to e*e»d.t* scope to any port to which an export may be destined, instead of, as formerly, only lo re Um Ireaty ports on the mainland of Arabia. It will therefore be interesting .o sec to what extent, under the present restrictions, the re-export tralhe is maintained. The system of issuing free manifests lor cargo borne in native craft to the mainland ports of Saudi-Arabia is still maintained, and appears to be appreciated locally.

It is expected that the year 1360 will prove to be one of financial strain for the mercantile •community, and that the State's revenue from all sources will noticeablv decrease.5G PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT BUDGET —1360 Hospitals.— Surgery Block Mortuary Kitchen Garage Store Servants Quarters Incinerator Isolation Hospital (Septic lank) Fort.— Police Married Quarters Prison Gate House Police Station (Dormitory) Bridge. — Construction Raising level and building room on side Rs. 50,000 2,500 1.5°° 1,000 1,000 3,000 500 1,000 30,000 1,500 1,000 Rs. 60,500 .VoooJ 28 1.8 •43 5- 6 .86 .86 •43 l.H .86 4-3 i.8 Skin diseases Burns Injuries and Accidents Bone disease Venereal disease Malnutritions H Rheumatism Disease of nervous system Malaria Miscellaneous 34 maternity cases were delivered in hospital and 45 patients treated lor narcological complaints. 69 major operations were performed and 112 minor operations. 205 laboratory tests were made. 55 patients were treated with eye disease, 12 ol which were operated for cataract Dr. Snow was kind enough to perform the eye operations.

If necessary they were sent by her to the Raladia dispensary. The result of this measure resulted in a notable improvement in the personal hygiene and health of the children, particularly in the reduction of eye disease. Now a small room has been allocated to the school nurse in the Manama School, and she attends school to give daily treatment. \ record is kept of her work. A nurse attends Moharraq and Hidd schools twice weekly but il is hoped that soon she will be able to attend Moharraq school daily to give treatment. THE LAND DEPARTMENT. During the year 457 registrations were, carried out and Rs, 6,430 was collected in fees. Tbc present fees for land registration arc extremely low in proportion to the amount of work involved in carrying out the registration. iMtid Aucliotis. —The department auctioned 41 properties for the Bahrain courts. This work is done free of charge although it involves almost as much work as registration of property. These properties are usually sold in order to satisfy claims against the owners and the owners are reluctant to give the department any help in establishing the boundaries, etc. Sometimes the owners arc not in Bahrain. Frequently the sale is not carried out because the parties come to an agreement during the auction period. The question of a fixed fee for such sales by the Land Department is under consideration.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100024152683.0x000005_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/750/5</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024152683.0x000005</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/750/5</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Government of Bahrain Annual Report for Year 1359 (February 1940 - February 1941)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1941/1941</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-24T00:34:48</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (36 folios)</extent><extent>This file contains an index (folio 167r) which references pages of the report.</extent><extent>Foliation: Folios 165-201.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This volume is the Annual Report of the Government of Bahrain for the year 1359 AH (1940-1941) and gives te details of the Revenue and Expenditure of the Bahrain State and contains notes on the activities of the various Government departments, as well as the budget 1360 and some particulars of importance which took place in Bahrain during the year.
