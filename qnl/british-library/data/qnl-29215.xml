A statement of expenditure on the Koweit Agency in 1934/35,just received from India, is attached for information and retention. It will be noticed that the statement includes Rs.21,281 for 'Construction of new Agency buildings at Koweit' bringing the total amount, exclusive of establishment costs, charged under that head from 1932/33 to 1934/35 to Rs.1,92,306. There is no entry in these accounts showing separately the cost of the electrical installation nor that of the furniture purchased and, as it seems that the electrical work was started in 1932 and some furniture was purchased in 1934, it is probable that both these classes of expenditure have been compiled by India in the 'construction” figures. Further charges are of course to be expected in the accounts for 1935/36 if the reported excesses over estimates are to be realised. (Sd.) R.A.Janes. Noted. Many thanks. Statement retained. (Sd.)

The Government of India now ask H.M.G. to bear a moiety of the extra expenditure incurred in this respect. They also proffer a similar claim in respect of (2) extra expenditure incurred in respect of the furniture for the new Agency. As regards (l), the amount sanctioned by the Treasury for buildings and outhouses (exclusive of electrification) of which Imperial revenues were to bear a moiety was * Rs.1,64,493 (P.Z.4412/32). A further expenditure of Rs. 4,300 was also approved (P.Z.5328/35) to allow for a tennis-court. Last August, a statement was forwarded setting forth in detail the total cost of construction (P.Z.7149/35), but the most recent figure quoted as representing the actual completion cost is somewhat smaller - Rs.1,74,517, i.e. Rs.5,524 in excess. The Political Resident in his letter of 17th November explains to some extent how the excess arose, and it is perhaps some consolation to learn that the \\ // building is a credit to H.M.G. It is submitted that we should now seek Foreign Office and Treasury concurrence in bearing a moiety of the sum involved. The Government of India make no reference to the departmental charges (vide papers at P.Z.1693/35) and in view of Mr.Janes’ note at P.Z.7149/35 it is not proposed to raise the point in connection with the straightforward construction excess. Item (2) concerns furniture. The estimate under this head, of which the Treasury agreed to accept a moiety, was Rs.5,500 (P.Z.1983/34 and P.Z.3500/34). Owing, apparently, chiefly to breakages in transit, this figure has been exceeded by Rs.300/2/-, and H.M.G. are asked to bear halfpr'W- '2 [inute Pa,per. Department. F./ 936 It is somewhat difficult to follov/ the stages leading up to the present proposal in the matter of the cost of construction, hut it is now observed that the expenditure brought to account by the end of 1953-34 totalled Rs.1,71,025 (i.e., Rs.61,153 in 1932-33 and Rs. 1,09,872 in 1933~34 - for the latter see the copy statement now placed on the file): at that time the Foreign Office had concurred in a total expenditure of Rs.1,64,493 only. The statement in question was forwarded to the Foreign Office in support of the claim for 1933-34 preferred by this Department in A.0.2023/36 on 13th March 1936 and that Department will therefore be aware already of the fact that the estimate, augmented by the sanctioned Rs.4500, had been exceeded. The claim in question had to be made before the end of March and in the absence of any communication from the Government of India on the subject at the time, the statement went over Y/ith no comment on the item. Incidentally the statement will have made it clear to the Foreign Office that the estimates on which they agreed to share the expenditure did not include establishment and percentage charges. lillL tiMfOsy ^/r 3939 5000 7/354599 5000 2.36 )raffc Paper.

The expenditure has already been incurred and met from within the sanctioned allotment at the disposal of the Political Resident. The excess comes to 3.26/o and the reasons therefor have been fully explained by the Political Resident. The explanation of the Assistant Engineer that the excess is covered by paragraph 69 of the Public Works Department Code is not correct, as the provi sions of that Code should be held to have been over-ridden by the assurance given by the Assistant engineer to the Resident in August 1934 and by the latter to the Government of India that there would be no further excesses requiring revision of the estimate. It is likely that either the —^ Assistant Engineer’s accounts were in a confused state or that he was under a genuine misapprehension regarding the permissibility of the excess under paragraph 69 of the Central Public Works Department Code. The Government of India regret that the local authorities failed to bring the excess to their notice to enable them to attain the prior acquiescence of His Majesty's Government and I am to request that the position may kindly be explained to His Majesty's Government and their concurrence obtained to bear a moiety of the excess expenditure incurred on the above mentioned buildings* I have the honour to be, for Foreign Secretary to the Government oi India* hj.recover the cost of the 'broken glasses from them, aji&lt;l the Insurance Company with whom the furniture was insured for onward despatch to Kuwait did not accept the risk of breakage of frag il e a rt ic 1 es . 2° In the circumstances I am to request th at th e ac au i es c enc oof His MaJ e s ty * s Q ovemme nt may kindly he obtained to share a moiety of the revised cost and canrauniGated to the Government of India. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, for foreign Secretary to the Government of Indiaf Copy of a memorandum Ho. 662 dated Bush.ire, 5 3/21-VII the 19th March 1936, from the Hon*hle the Political Resident in v±i&amp; Persian Gulf, to the foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Hew Delhi.

In the meantime, a to^wn lighting scheme is being prepared at Zahidan and I think it better to wait to see whether it materialises in which case it would be much more economical to purchase current from it, than to run a separate installation* Your most obedient servant, Sd.

The Government of India - vide the last sentence of their paragraph 2 - enquire (a) why they were not advised of the position at'an earlier stage, and (b) how the extra expenditure involved has been met. 3. With regard to (a), the extra amount of Rs.4,500/- was applied for in May 1934, vide my letter No. 1076/53/21 dated the 7th May 1934. Before applying to His Majesty’s Government for this extra amount, the Government of India asked for an assurance that there would be no other charges which would require a further revision of the sanctioned estimate. This assurance ms given in my Express Letter No. 1986/53/21 dated the 30th August 1934. The sum in question was finally sanctioned in August 1935 - vide Government of India, Department of XudusU ies and Labour letter No. AW 83 dated the 29th August! 1935. 4. I have discussed the matter at length with*. Mr. Path All Shaikh and have inspected his account registers. By the end of September 1934, the As-i&amp;tantEngineer had already expended the original amount sanctioned plus the sum of Rs.4,500/- mentioned above, hut the house was not completed till April of this year, i.e., there was at the time a considerable amount of work still to he completed. I do not understand therefore why at that date he did not draw my attention to this state of affairs, more especially as this office Express letter No.1986/53/21 dated the 30th August 1934 (quoted above) was based on an estimate of the situation provided by him. I have no wish to place undue responsibility for the present unfortunate state of affairs on Mr. Fateh All Shaikh, but as Assistant Engineer, especially with the powers of an Executive Engineer, he is responsible to the political Resident for the Public Works Department work in the Gulf, and it is part of his duty to keep the Resident, who has many other claims on his time and attention and who is a Political not a Public Works Department officer, -piny informed of how this work is progressing. If Mr. Fateh Ali Shaikh, in the present instance, had done so, I should, of course, have inforraed the Govern ment of India of how the situation stood. 5, Mr. Fateh Ali Shaikh’s explanation i^jiven in paragraph 1 of his letter. I am afraid that I do not consider his explanation altogether satisfactory. The outstanding fact remains that when the total ., ; v sanctioned grant was exhausted, there was still another six months’ work to be completed and Mr. Fateh All\ Shaikh did not bring this to my notice. On the other hand, Mr. Fateh Ali Shaikh maintains that, in view of the fact that the excesses occurred at an advancedii' &amp; period in the construction, the suhtnission of a revised estimate was not required hy the Public Works Depart ment rules - vide paragraph 98 of the Central public Works Department Code. Further, the net excess over the sanctioned amount was Rs.6,040/- only (Rs. 1,75,033 minus Rs. 1,68,993) which falls within the permissible limit of 5% of the sanctioned estimate. This excess, Mr. Fateh All Shaikh maintains, is covered by paragraph 69, Central Public Works Department Code. 6. With regard to (b), the excess expenditure has been met from the appropriations and re-appropriations sanctioned by the Government of India from time to time The expenditure incurred during the current year amounting to Rs.818/- has been met from the provision of Rs.4,500/- under 41-Civil Works - Central - A - Original Works - Major Works, thus leaving a balance of Rs.3,682/- to be surrendered. 7.

From The Assistant Engineer, Independent Persian Gulf Sub-Division, To The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject:- Construction of the New Agency building at Kuwait. Sir, With reference to the correspondence resting with your office note dated the 21st October 1935, I have the honour to state that the expenditure incurred in excess was noticed at an advanced stage when the work was nearing completion and all the materials and expert labour imported from abroad was already on the site of: work and so any report or the submission of a revised estimate was purposeless vide rules contained in paras. 98 et seq of the central P.W.D. Code. 2. It may be stated as well that the excess involved falls within 'o% of the cost of the sanctioned estimate. 3. All the expenditure incurred against this estimate was covered by appropriations and re-appropria tions sanctioned by the Government of India.

It would seem that the Government of India should, therefore, now seek sanction to charging the Foreign Office with a moiety of a further amount representing the difference between the estimated excess on construction (Rs.4,500) and that realised (Rs. 10,063). If nothing is heard from them in the near future it is presumed that they will he reminded accordingly. In the meantime, it is perhaps desirable not to send the correspondence received to date to the Foreign Office. As regards the addition for departmental charges there is a possibility that the Foreign Office may take the same view of the position as that put forward by India (PZ 1693) i.e. that the departmental charges added to the cost of the new building at Kuwait relieve charges which they would have borne otherwise under Persia (Bushire)• For this reason it is thought that there may be an advantage in separating the discussion of the question of the straight-forward excess shown in the statement from that of departmental charges. An additional reason is that, as construction lasted until June 1935, the completion of the apportionment of departmental charges to this project may have to wait the closing of the accounts/-&gt; P 7. i &gt; I ; 40 file oopif ^ 14/ It Buahiretdated 3/s/' August 1935* ^ 1*0. //SO — FSTTi. !• r oia X Q i’lie HQa f t)le trie Political Betiaent in Va# Pax*clan Gulf, The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla* Construction of the New Agency Building at Kuwait Sir, I have the honour to state that the work constructing the new Agency huiidlings at Kuwait has been completed and handed over to the Political Agent, Kuwait* 2.

The Kuwait Electricity Company is now firmly established and an agreement from them to supply the Agency with current at 6 annas per unit for a period of 3 years in the first place could be obtained. No difficulty is anticipated in renewing such an agreement whenever desired. 3. Ho expenditure on electrification will be incurred during the current financial year.enquiry has served to obtain some useful information hut it is doubtful whether it is expedient to proffer the information to the Foreign Office at this stage in preference to awaiting enquiries, which may not eventuate. The letter, however, appears incorrect in stating that the cost of the Civil Works establishment is shared in mokties between His Majesty's Government and India. The sphere of this establishment includes the purely Indian posts of Bahrein and Muscat and a presumably varying sum in respect of its cost must fall upon Indian Revenues finally each year. The argument, therefore, that an increase under Koweit counterbalances a decrease under Bushire is to that extent vitiated. On a point of detail the figure of Rs.46,945 for 1931-32 mentioned at the end of the second paragraph of the letter is not the correct one for purposes of the comparison, as it included arrears of Rs.19,313 connected 1 ^ with the construction of the Ahwaz building only at long- last brought to account by India. The true comparison is Rs. 27,632 with Rs.7,267, giving a decrease of Rs.20,365 whereas the amount charged under Koweit is nearly Rs.27,000. &amp; /j, , 7 ^ 4^^, . 3-Uwjc . rv- Lrunj: v - - 4 ^ _ &lt;k&gt; ktjr ' _ ^ ^&gt;^ 1 - 1 ^ u,- 4 v, 4 n-w h, ly. a 4wBY AIR MA.IT, Foreign and Political Department, D,0.No.F.19-A/3&amp; New Delhi Please refer to my demi-official letter No, D.2707-A/34, dated the 10th Januar 3 ^ 1935. 2, The case has been examined and we find the position to he as follows :- (i) The estimate of Rs. 1,64,493/- given in our express letter N0.F.367-A/31, dated the 4th May 1932, for the construction of the new agency buildings at Kuweit (excluding the cost of electric installation) was exclusive of departmental charges. as you are aware, the expenditure in connection with the Independent Sub-Division in the Persian Gulf is divisible in moieties between the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government, and of the total expendi ture incurred on this account, portions are adjusted against the works concerned representing departmental charges, and the balance of the cost of the Sub- Division is shown in the statement of divisible expenditure under ”Bushire.-41-Civil Works”. The departmental charges of Rs.26,713/- shown on page 1 of the statement of expenditure incurred on the Koweit Agency during the year 1932-33, are really a portion(3) Foreign and Political Department, The 193 . of the cost of the Persian Gulf Suh-Division, trans ferred from one divisible head to another for accounts purposes, and there is, therefore, no question of any Increase in the gross total expenditure agreed to by His Majesty's Government on account of the independent sub-division and the building scheme. if there had been no works in Koweit, the share of the cost of the Persian Gulf Sub-Division would have been correspond ingly higher. For example, in 1931-32 the expenditure under '41-Civil Works - Bushire Residency - vide page 6 of the statement of expenditure incurred on Diplo- 2 matic and Consular Services in Persia during 1932-33 was Rs.46,945/- as against Rs.7,267/- in 1932-33. As regards the maintenance of the electric 3. plants at Koweit during 1932-33, it will be noticed from the Political Resident's memorandum Ho.2024, dated the 1st October 1932, that he estimated an expenditure of Rs.1,800/- per annum, after taking into account the recoveries from the Political Agent and the Medical Officer, and we were asked to provide this amount in the budget estimates for 1933-34.

G. Laithwaite, Esqr., C.I.E., India Office, London.Go ^ UJ - J-eiiier ao.i7a^i7/i5 Of-1934, dated Zstul (Bast Persia), the 14th. December 1934, from ifca His ifej esty*s Consul Senaral for Khorasan, to the i'oreign Secretary to the Government of India in the foreign and Political Department, Mew Delhi. I havte the honour to inform the Government of India that when I assumed charge of the Meshed Consulate General in 1932* I found installed there a machine for supplying electric light for the Consulate buildings. It is not known from what source this machine was derived hut X gathered that it had been acquired from military stores disposed of at the end of the War, 2, 1 found the machine in bad order and it was most uneconomic to run, fhe upkeep was chargeable in proportion of lights used, to the various officers supplied and in respect of lights used in offices, to Government, 3o As I found that tne cost to Government for lighting offices was higher than would be incurred by taking lights from the town supply, I ordered the discontinuance of the use of machine and each officer now pays direct for current connected from the town supply to his quarters, it being regulated by separate meters* 4. I considered at one time the feasibility of obtaining the sanction of the Government of India to the machine being used at Zahidan Vice Consulate, but after full consideration and consultation with the Vice Consul at Zahidan at the time, we came to the conclusion that the engine was too costly to repair and7 &amp;no - maijlta ^n (being much larger than necessary for &amp;ahidan/ and that it could not be made an economic proposal. During my absence on leave Major Gastrell and Captain Hose conceived the idea of using the caine at 2ahidan and it was transported there# repaired and erected. 'The estimates for cost of running which Captain Hose submitted» were I am convinced (having had some experience of the machine at Meshed) far too optimistic* There was a scheme for connecting the machine by a line to the Bazar to jy&amp;p supply current to shopkeepers# in an endeavour to lighten the burden of cost on the Tic© Consul and possibly a few members of his staff who might use lights# Such a project is, of course, quite impossible in the present state of affairs in Persia and would have led t o difficulties with the Persian authorities. It was# in fact, subsequently not attempted. 6. To operate this machine at Sahidan would involve expenditure out of all proportion to the number of lights to be used. The proportionate cost which would fall to be met from the Office Allowance grant of the Vice Consul would be excessive and the propcrtion falling on the incumbent of the post would be so heavy (allowing for the cost of repairs which would be continuously high, the machine being old and no experienced mechanic in charge) that, even should the present officer be willing to meet it, future incumbents of the post would in all probability object, or expect to obtain funds from Government to meet the charge*- 5 - 7# Under the eircumstances X have instructed tue Vice Consul not to incur further expense (the machine is already temporarily out of action and requires new spare parts 8 * the amenities of the very unpleasant post at Zahidan would he improved could electric light he made available and inasmuch as the wiring to the building has been completed I beg to suggest that the Government of India might be pleased to sanction *xte purchase of a very small and suitable engine* which would be economical to run* for installation at this post. If this be approved in principle, X think that some offer might be obtainable locally for the large machine and this, with a small supplement which it may be possible to afford from the Tice Consults Office Allowance next financial year, would meet the cost without necessity to apply to Government for extra funds. In the meantime the present machine would not be operated, or if used, would be operated at the expense of the Vice Consul for the time being* 9. Tne cost of running the small installation would be met in future by debit to the contract grant for lighting the official portion of the builaing and to the Vice Consul personally in respect of his private quarters in direct proportion to the number of lights used in each and for this purpose also no extra funds will be necessary* 10. If the Government of India will be pleased to approve of this scheme, X will make enquiries as to the sum which can be obtained by sale of the existing engine, and the cost of a small one, and if the total cost can be met without necessity of applying......* fc* wt a PPlying for extra funds, will permit the Tice Consul 1 0 t;aice ^ te matter in hand next financial year.

The final estimate sanctioned by the Treasury (after some demur) was as follows (see P.Z. 2929/32, P.Z. 4357/32 AT and P.Z.5170/32). 1. Construction of new Agency 2. ” ” Outhouses 3. Electrification of new Agency Total Rs. 1,36,817 t 27,676 19,823 Rs.1,84,316~ Item 3 represents:- Rs. a) Electrification of the old Agency 18,823 b) Cost of wiring new Agency on transfer of electric plant to it (otherwise described as 'loss on wiring”) 1,000 19,823 In accordance with H.M.G.’s sanction the work of electrifying the old Agency was put in hand and completed. The papers do not show what the final cost of this work was but we can, I think, assume that it did not diffei appreciably from the sanctioned estimate of Rs.13,823. The new Agency has now been completed and the additional cost of electrifying it should be no more than the sanctioned cost of wiring it, viz. R. 3 .• /.if/hQ.*- This amount was sanctioned on the understanding that the generating plant and fittings at present in the old Agency would be transferred to the new Agency when ready for occupation. fince February, 1934, however, an Electric | Supply Company has begun to operate in Koweit. It appears j to be doing well and to be now firmly estaolisned. Colonel Fowle therefore recommends that the proposal to electrify the new Agency by means of the generating plants should/Mg mm i - ! should be now abandoned in favour of a proposal to link up the Agency with the new Kuwait Electricity Company’s supply. The Government of India in their telegram below reccmmend the acceptance of this proposal which is estimated to cost Hs.2 ,555. The details are given in ’Scheme A l.New Agency Building’ in para.6 of Bushire ■k Memo, dated 3rd June 1034 (P. Z.5115/34).^- Colonel Bowie also recommended - on P.Z.5115/34 and r P.Z.7132/34 - that the Medical Officer should move into the old Agency and that the Head Clerk should move into the Medical Officer’s present quarters, and that these buildings should also be supplied with electricity by the company. The Government of India do not accept these recommendations for the reasons given in Part II of their telegram oelow. These reasons seem conclusive and it is submitted that we may accept them. If this is agreed to these two officers will stay where they are. ihe Government of India are prepared , however , to electrify the Medical Officer’s quarters by linking them to the company at an estimated cost of Rs. 25 0. The details of the estimate are given under Head III of Colonel Bowie’s ’’Scheme A”. The total cost of these proposals amounts to Rs.2,903, which is Rs.1,903 in excess of the Rs.1,000 sanctioned for the purpose. (The proposal to electrify the Medical Officer’s house, it is true, is a new one). It is therefore necessary to ask the Boreign Office for their concurrence before sanctioning the proposals of the Government of India. It will be seen that the recurrent expenditure on th , * ** consumption of electricity in the official part of the Agency is estimated to be Rs.900 per annum. This will, if tae proposal is accepted, be shared by Indian and Imperial revenues.

We have recently received copies of the “Statement of expenditure incurred on the Koweit Agency during the year 1932-33“ and have been examining the figure of Rs.87,866 given therein under the head «41rCivil Works' on page 1. The whole of this sum appears to have been incurred in connexion with the construction of the new Agency Building. As this sum is considerably in excess of the amount (Rs. 60,000) allotted j.or disbursement by the Political Resident on this account during the financial year under consideration^vie were wondering whether the^estimate of Rs.1,64,493 given in the Government of India’s letter under reference was intended to be exclusive of/departmental e^enses.

For this building Rs. 50/- per mensem, as sanctioned by the Government of India for the quarters o± the Head Clerk and the Medical Officer, is paid. The Iraq Post Office pay for their share of this building Rs. 30/- per mensem, and this sum is paid for the rent of the Medical Officer’s present house. ^ (B) This query is dealt with under my reply^AA) • (C) (i) The reasons for shifting the officials in question from their existing quarters are as follows^ The house at present occupied by the Medical nffi^r though adequate, is considerably smaller than considerably more comfortable in it. It is Quite true, as pointed out in paragraph 3 of your letter ^der reference, that the old Agency- as reported linvJhne and July 1929 - was in a very bad condition. ,&lt;M?ce then, however, the sum o^RS. 1,800/- has been spent on it - vide Government of India telegram No.771 of 13th November 1929*1 The condition of the old agency HasV ir/zf has therefore been i&gt; proved. Moreover as the old Agency was a gift from Shaikh Mubarak, no rent Is now paid for it, and no rent will be paid as long as it IS occupied by an official of the Government of India. If, however, it is given up and remains untenanted then the Government of India will lose their claim and the present Shaikh will doubtless reclaim it. Should the Medical Officer be shifted to the old Agency, Government of India will have the use of this house rent-free. Moreover, I propose that the Medical Officer’s Dispensary and his Store Room be housed in certain rooms in the court yard which is attached to the old Agency. This would be convenient for the Medical Officer, and Government would thus get free of rent a commodious building for the Medical Ofiicer himself, his Dispensary and his Store Room. (ii) The reason for shifting the Head Clerk to * e Medical Officer’s present house are that this house is more conmodious than the quarters at present occupied by him, and the sum of Rs. 50/- per mensem, sanctioned by Government from the Political Agent’s Office Allowance, will cover the rent of the Head Clerk's new house, i.e. Medical Officer’s present house. (Hi) with reference to your paragraph 3 the points raised have been met in my paragraph 2 above. To sum up. By my proposal the Medical Officer and Head Clerk will be more commodiously accommodated without any further cost to Government than the RS.50/. sanctioned for the quarters of these two officials. So much for the subject of quarters. To turn to the question of rnfiotriclty. 3, Since the issue of this office Memorandum No. 1299, dated the 3rd June 1934, circumstances have somewhat changed and the Kuwait Electricity Company aDpear 'to 'be firmly estaolisnccio havejust ‘bougtit an extra engine and are selling more currmt than they did five months ago. 4 yor these reasons I nov; recorimend Scheme*A’ proposed in my memorandum No. 1299 dated the 3rd June 1934 vri.th the modification that instead of 8 fans in the old Agency I propose four he supplied, and instead of two fans for the Heasl Cleric one he supj -ied, thus saving Rs. 500/- i.e. cost of five ce_... 5&gt; Briefly, if the Government of India decide on Scheme *A*, i°e° dispose of the present plant in the and sanction the joining up of the new Agency XbocBbs old Agency /to the Town supply, they will maRe a considerable saving on recurring expenditure. ’he present installation in the old Agency costs Government Rs. 2,000/- per annum, (vide Kuwait Agency Budget Allotment) and will continue to cost the same should the present installation he moved to the new Agency. Should, however, the latter he joined up to the Town supply instead, the recurring cost fco Government will he Rs. 900 I.e. the Government share of the electricity hill for the offices and public rooms. This Rs. 900/- is based on the estimate of the Government electricity hill for the Bahtain Agency and will certainly he not more than that - perhaps less since the unit charge is less in Kuwait than in Bahrain. Government will therefore save Rs.2000-P.3900 6 . Government will also get the sale proceeds o the articles enumerated in paragraph 6 (V) of my Memorandum 1299 of 3rd June 1934. 7 The pros and cons were gone into in my Memorandum No. 1299 of 3rd June 1934 and now in view of the small extra cost involved by going on to the tom supply instead of transferring all equipment I recommend Government to sanction Rs.3,200/- viaevide paragraph 6 of my Memorandum No, 1299, dated the 3rd June 1934 urgently so that the Political Agent may move into the n ew Agency which is othe rwise ready for habitation.2800 5000 5 34. / P.Z. 5812/34. f.fj.

The articles of furniture required are detailed in the attached Statement which was prepared by the 7 /Copy Statement n B' 7 P.Z.7223/33. at Political Agent and approved by the Government of India. Authority has been granted for the purchase of these articles provided the cost does not exceed Rs.2124, and provided the cost of purchase plus the cost of freight and insurance does not exceed I Rs.2,340. It is understood that you are willing to give Colonel Dickson all possible assistance in the matter, and I am accordingly to request you to make the necessary arrangements in consultat ion with him for the purchase of the furniture within the specified limits of expenditure.

The estimate sanctioned by the Government of India is given in their Express Letter to Bushire, Ho.F.346- A/33, d;ated the 7th June 1934, a copy of which is enclosed for ease of reference. It will be seen that the estimated cost of freight and insurance for both the Office furniture (which, it is understood, is being purchased in/ 2800 5000 5 34in India) and the furniture for the two reception rooms is Rs.21S. It is difficult to say how this sum should he divided between the two items, and so the Director General of the India Store Department has been authorised to purchase the furniture for the reception rooms at a total cost, including freight and insurance, not exceeding Rs.2,340 (Rs.2124 plus Rs.216), but this authorisation is given on the understanding that the total cost of these two items,together with freight and insurance^does not exceed Rs.3,500 in all.

Before the India Office is addressed, the Government of India will he glad if you will submit as early as possible a list of the articles of furniture for the private portion of the Agency building. In selecting the articles, it is requested that care should be taken that the furniture should he plain and must not include such articles as pianos, billiard tables, cushions, table equipment, china, glass, cutlery, plate, lamps, or linen. 4. As regards your proposal to purchase furniture for the two reception roans from England, the Government of India would not object to heavy articles of furniture such as settees and easy-ohairs being bought in England, but they would suggest that anything in the nature of cabinets, tables, dining room chairs, etc., should for climatic reasons be made in India. There should be no difficulty in getting suitable furniture made/2 . made in Bombay* If&gt; however, you are unable to arrange the supply, the Chief Engineer, Central Public Works Department, has agreed to get the requisite furniture made in Delhi if you could supply the designs. 5. The Chief Engineer, Central Public Works Department, considers that the amount allowed for freight and insurance, i.e. Rs.216 for office and reception rooms furniture, would be inadequate because furniture, if carefully packed, would be extremely bulky. The Government of India will be glad to have your remarks on this point. 6. Now that the project for the construction and electrification of the new agency buildings at Kuwait should be nearing completion, can you report whether there will be any saving in the sanctioned estimate, and if so, how much. 7.

With reference to paragraph 3 of your memorandum under reply, the Chief Engineer, Central Public Works Department, who has been consulted, still adheres to the opinion expressed in paragraph 4 of this Department express letter No.F.346-A/33, dated the 25th of November 1933. The Chief Engineer who has extensive personal experience of purchasing of furniture from well-known firms in London is satisfied that such furniture is not satisfactory for India much less for the trying climate of Persian Gulf. He has suggested, however, that your proposals may be approved provided the firm supplying the furniture will agree to replace anything which may be found to be unsuitable during the first three years, or better still to pay a deposit which can be refunded at the end of that time, if everything is proved to be satisfactory. The Government of India agree that if you decide to purchase all the furniture for the reception rooms from England either of the precautions suggested by the Chief Engineer should be taken in respect of articles such as cabinets, tables, dining roan chairs, etc. 4. No expenditure or any liability should be incurred on this account until the approval of His Majesty’s Government has been received and formal sanction for the Government of India accorded to the proposal.Copy of memorandum from the Secretary to the Hon'hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to the Political Agent, Kuwait , No.1313/53/21, dated the 5th June 1934.

If any are willing then you should select a firm and obtain a guarantee from it, which you should submit for scrutiny, which to save time the India Office, London, might be willing to scrutinise.

Since then i.e., last February, an Electric Supply Company has been established which produces j k electricity for the town, so it would seem that Kuwait is now assured of a continuous day and night electricity supply at a cost of six annas a unit. \ 4 „ The Political Agent, Kuwait, proposes that the Medical Officer should move to the present Agencg Building and that the Head Clerk should occupy the present Medical Officer’s quarters when the new Agency is ready. The present Agency Building is one propert„ of His Highness the Shaikh, who allows the use of it to the Government of India rent free. This proposal therefore does not involve any extra expense to 1 Government and I recommend that it be sanctioned.5. The Political Agent has now suggested. tha\ the following general reasons it would he advantageous to huy current from the Kuwait Electricity Company for all Agency buildings (a) Government would he saved about Rs,800/- of the Rs.1800/- per annum which is now granted for running the private plant. (b) The cost to the Political Agent for current supplied would be much less than at present as the Company charge only six annas per unit as against Rs.35/- per mensem paid by him at present, which is based on the rate of 12 annas per unit. 6 . The Kuwait Electricity Company who were asked to quote for the proposal as at 4 and 5 above, and which I will call scheme 'A', have tendered as follows:- Scheme 'A' I. Wow Asencv Building.. The Kuwait Electricity Company offer to:- (a) wire the whole new building and erect 101 lamps, 17 fans and 16 plugs (i.e. 134 points) at Rs. 12 /- per point, all wires to be enclosed in best English teak wood casing. Total cost Rs. 1,608/-. (b) supply wire and erect six gate globe- lamps at Rs. 15/- each = Rs.90/-. (c) supply and erect 3 meters at Fs.hB/-. Total Rs.105/-. (d) supply l? new fans in place of old fans 110 volts already in use in old Agency and Medical Officer's quarters at a cost of Rs.850/- i.e. at Rs.50/- each the total cost of a fan being Rs.100/- but the balance being set off in allowance for the old fans. Total amount Rs.2&gt;§63/-»III. IV. Note. It will be seen that owing to difference in voltage the fans and. bulbs in the present Agency could not be used with the current supplied by the Company.

AS regards time of change over, the Kuwait Electricity Company guarantee to work as follows:- (a) 15 days from giving the order the existing Agency and Medical Officer's quarters would be running on Town supply. (b) within one month of giving the order, work would be started on the New Agency and according to the Directors would be completed by the end of the second month. If the above proposals were adopted there will remain on hand the following articles which would have to be disposed of for vtfiis/fc tliey TOUld. (a) 2 Kohler engines complete. (to) 1 mile thicK copper wire to Medical Officer’s house. III. IV.1 7. Another scheme which I will call scheme 'B' is as follows (a) In accordance with Government instructions, (contained in Note No.N-12355 Schedule of 7 *17/ 1, requirements (No.1136) for the generating plant and electrical wiring of the Agency Building at Kuwait, which formed an enclosure to the Foreign and Political Department memorandum under reference), the existing motors, fans and bulbs etc., now in. use at Kuwait to be removed and installed in the New Agency Building. (b) The wiring, however, not to be removed from the old Agency to the Hew since (1) in doing so wastage is bound to result, and ( 2 ) the wiring will be required for the Medical Officer’s house when he occupies the old Agency (see paragraph 4 above and paragraph 8 below). These reasons also apply to the present Medical Officer’s nouse (see paragraph 4 above and paragraph 8 below). (c) As regards the old Agency, where it is proposed that the Medical Officer will live, the old wiring to be left in and joined to the Kuwait Electric Company’s supply with the following points supplied by Government:- 2 ceiling fans cost Rs. 200 /- 2 table fans ' Rs. 100 /- 15 lights ” Rs.50/- 1 meter ' Rs.35/- (d) As in 7(c) above also for the house in which the Head Clerk will live, being the Medical Officer’s $old house, only with the following points:- 1 ceiling fan cost Rs. 100/-1 table fan cost f$. 50/- 7 lights ' Rs. 20 /- 1 meter ' Rs. 35/- Total cost for these two houses about Rs.600/- 8 . I recommend that the Medical Officer and the Head Clerk be provided with facilities for using current for the following reasons, (a) The heat of Kuwait necessitates that electricity (if available, which it is now owing to the presence of the Electric Supply Company) should be at the disposal of the officials concerned. Government too have for instance connected the Medical Officer of Bahrain’s house to an electricity supply current, and are going to do so at Muscat. 9 . of the two schemes detailed above, I am inclined to favour scheme f, B' for the following reasons (a) It is not yet certain that the Kuwait Electricity Company vttiich has only been in existence a fe\i months is as yet a permanently established concern. Were it to close down the disadvantages of scheme 'A' are too obvious to need comment. (b) Government wired the old Agency on condition that the plant and fittings should be removed to the new Agency. (c) When some years have passed and more use has been made of the above plant, and experience has showd§ whether the Electric Company is likely to be firmly established, the alternative of selling the plant etc., and joining up with the Company supply can to© considered., \ (d) On the other hand, should the Kuwait electricity Company close down the loss to Government for the installation of the Medical Officer and Head , Clerks Quarters would foe very snnall. tFrom - The Additional Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Forei gn taad Political* Department, To - The Hon ’hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

From the previous reports submitted to the Government of India from time to tiuse it is observed that the old Agency building was in an extremely bad condition and declared to be unsafe for occupation. In view of this it is not understood why it is now proposed to shift the Medici! Officer to this building.

As already intimated to Government (vide my memorandum l?o*307/53/21-V dated the 3rd February 1934) no savings on the project are anticipated; the cupboards are absolutely necessary and recesses for 15 cupboards of various sizes have already been left in the several rooms. The estimated cost of 15 cupboards is Rs.l500/«. 3. Owing to the fact that the Political Agent has consider able entertaining to do of officers of the various services visiting him from time to time, in addition to entertaining the local residents, I consider it necessary that he is provided with a tennis court at Government expense in the new agency compound. A mud court with a solid base it is estimated would cost about Rs.500/-. 4.

Purniture for the New Agency Building at Kuwait. I have the honour to inform you that the New Agency Building at Kuwait is expected to he completed and ready for occupation hy April 1934, when it will he necessary to provide furniture befitting the size and dignity of the house. 2. The furniture available in the present Agency building which is a much smaller house is not only insufficient, but most of it is old, shabby and un sightly, and will have to be replaced. I have, there fore, obtained from Lieutenant Colonel DicKson the two Lists (a) and (B) which I enclose. They relate to Office F urni ture and to Burn i t ure .i n, t he .Re cep ti on Rooms , respectively, and each shows the existing furniture, of which a part is to be kept and a part to be condemned, and the additions which are necessary. I consider the new furniture, for which Colonel Dickson has asked, to be necessary and the cost to be reason able. I, therefore, request that the Government of India will be pleased to sanction a grant of 8s.3,500 (including freight and insurance) for the purpose. 3. The expenditure incurred in the purchase of furniture for both the office and reception rooms will be accounted by the Political Agent. 4. The existing furniture in the residential for^n portion of the Agency is also inadequate and old. I do V life* 1 * T 1933 not/not think that in the circumstances obtaining in Kuwait it is lair to expect the oificer who will first occupy the house to defray the cost of furnishing the Agency himself and to wait to recoup the outlay from his successor who may or may not he willing to take over the furniture, fhe practice, moreover, of each incumbent of the post having to buy the furniture from his immediate predecessor is unsatisfactory and taking advantage of the provision of a New Agency Building, I would recommend for the favourable consideration of Government that the residential portion also of the Agency should be furnished at Government expense, the furniture provided being plain and limited to articles that are really necessary, for the furniture thus provided the incumbent of the post will pay rent at the prescribed rate and will be subject to the rules regulating the furnishing of residences at Government expense. The furniture in the reception rooms which is now supplied free of rent on the analogy of Section 105 (c) of the Manual of Instructions to Officers of the Political Department of the Government of India should continue to be so treated and should be excluded from the assessment of rent. 5. In the event of the Government of India agreeing to the proposal in the preceding paragraph I request the sanction of the Government of India to a grant of Rs. 2,000 (including freight and insurance) to be placed at the disposal of the Political Agent and to be accounted for by him by the production of lists of the furniture purchased supported by bilIsland vouchers. 6 . Oolonel Dickson proposes to buy the furniture for the office and for the residential quarters from India/— —— India, and for the reception rooms from England. I support the proposal and request uhe approval of the Government of India. 7. Finally I request that provision for the sum of 33.5,500 may he included in the ensuing year’s (1934-35) budget estimates to meet the above expend! ture.Telegram N0.875-A/33* Dated the 25th October 1933.

The Government of India are satisfied that the proposed fixed recoveries of Rs.35/~ per mensem, and Hs. 20/- per mensem, from the Political Agent and the Medical Officer at Kuweit respectively, throughout the year, compare reasonaoly with the amounts recovered at Bushire where officers pay at 12 annas a unit. 2 ^ rjj^Q net expenditure to Government on the running and maintenance of the electric plants at Kuweit, after taking into account the charges to be recovered from the Political Agent, and the Medical Officer, is estimated at Rs. 1,300/- a year.

Memorandum No.£0 24. Bushire dated the 1st October 1932. Application for grant for cost of running the Kuwait Agency electric plant. Reference Foreign and Political Department memorandum No.F.36?-A/3i, dated the 30th November 1931, conveying sanction to the installation of electric plant, fans and lights in the Agency Buildings at Kuwait. 2. The question 0 p funds for meeting the cost of running the above plant was held over till the installation was completed and information gained by actual working of the plant. 3. The Kuwait plant, as Government are aware, 5 consists of one l-g- Kilowat engine and one/Kilowat engine. From figures supplied to the Political agent by Mr. Bills of Messrs; Osier and Company, Bombay, and by Mr. Chatterjee, Superintending Engineer of the above firm who carried out the installation in the Kuwait Agency buildings, the cost of running the 5 Kilowat engine is approximately 2t times that ol running the Kilowat engine. This is also borne out by Dr. Myirea of the American Mission in Kuwait. This Mission has a Kohler electric plant of two li Kilowat engines and each engine works 5 hours a day on alternate days. From seven years of actuale^erience the Mission has found that the consumption of petrol and oil hy each of these engines is as follows: - Eor 3 hours of running....*..,! gallon petrol ^C&gt;0 * - - .*..*...1 gallon lubricating oil. According to the above datj^ifthich the actual cost of running the Agency plant during the last two months has confirmed the cost of running the plant lor 6 hours a day in the I'/in&amp;cr months (i.e. November to April) and nine hours a day in the Summer months (i.e. May to October) will be as follows:- Finter months (6 hours a day) Small Bngin© -- 15 tins (4 gallons each} petrol ® &amp;.&amp;/- per tin... iis.75 1 gallon lubricating oil.. * 6 Distilled water for radiator and batteries.. .....* 5 Rs. 86 Big Bngine - Zi times above.......... * 215 Total Rs. 301 Therefore working each engine on alternate days the cost per mensem will be t the above total say Rs. 150 and for 6 months.... Rs. 900 Bummer months (Nine hours a day) cost per mensem will be Rs. 225-for 6 months fis. 1350 Total per annum Rs.2^50 Add cost of spares and repaires and cleaning material per annum Rs. 150 Allowance to motor boat mechanic for care and supervision at*25 per mensem. .. Rs. 300 Grant total per annum Rs.2,7004. Against this expenditure there will he the contributions from the Politico.! ^gent and the Medical Officer for the cost of current consumed hy them. It was suggested that metres should he put in and that the officers should he charged at 1£ annas per unit as at Bushire hut the suggestion is, found to he impracticable at present for the following reasons (a) As there was nothing in the Government Contract No.12355 in regard to the installation to indicate that metres were required no separate mains were put in for the office portion of the building and for the residential portion and the wiring is consequently inextricably mixed up. Ib attempt to get a fair apportionment, therefore, of the charges as between the political Agent, Medical Officer and the Office it would he necessary to put in 5 metres. (h) The installation which is a Kohler automatic plant gives a special voltage of 110 volts and metres to suit this voltage are, according to Mr. Chatterjee, the Superintending Engineer of Messrs; Osier and Company, probably not procurable anywhere in India and would have to be ordered from Kohlers in america. This would take time and when the metres did arrive an expert w r ou!d have to be sent to Kuwait to fix them up owing to the intricate nature of the wiring. In view of the recent receipt of sanction to the construction of a New Agency building and in the above circumstances I feel it would be uneconomical to instal metres in the present tumble down Agency building at the heavy additional expenditure such a measure would entail and I therefore recommend for the sanction ol the Government of India that a fixed contribution of Ks.35/- per mensem and J&amp;.2Q/- per mensem should be recovered from the Political Agent and Medical Officer respectively throughout the year.These rates of contribution are more than double the cost of paraffine for lamps hitherto used by the Officers and are a fair proportion to the pay drawn by them. Metres can be installed when the plant is transferred to the new Agency building. The above contributions will yield Hs.660 per annum which deducted from the sum of Rs.2,700 will result in a net\ charge of Ks. 2,040 for cost of running the plant. Allowing for economies, I request that the Government of India will be pleased to sanction an additional allotment of Ss. 1,800 for cost of running the plant to be included in the Kuwait Oifice Allowance grant for the ensuing financial year The net^ expenditure on the plant during the current 1inancial year will be met by reappropriation The necessary reappropriation statement will be forwarded to Government on receipt of their sanction to the proposals now submitted. sa. t-14' ^ ( for Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf.Foreign and Political Department Simla, the 12th October '3* Dear Gastrell, Please refer to your memorandum No.2024, dated the 1st October 1932, and your demi-official letter of the 2nd October. It will be convenient if you could Kindly furnish us very urgently information on the following points:- (1) The average monthly charges paid by the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Residency Surgeon and the Political Agent, Baird n, for electric current consumed in the private portions of their residences and the rate at which charges are calculated per unit, end (2) the net average expenditure incurred by Government for lights and punkhas in the offices and public portions of the residences of the Political Agent and the Medical Officer, Koweit, before the installation of the electric plant. Does your estimate of running the new electric plant after allowing for recoveries from the Political Agent and she Medical Officer take into account the savings of the present expenditure under hot and cold weather charges? It appears from paragraph 4 of your demi-official letter of the 2nd October that the allowance made for economies is only Rs.240/- but it is presumed that the expenditure on hot and cold weather charges and lighting of the office should be more than this amount. If my presumption is correct;the estimate could probably be reduced further. A very urgent reply is requested, as the increased expenditure v/ill have to be provided for in the budget.

My dear Karahari Rao, Kindly refer to your Demi-Official letter KO.K.367-A/31 of the 29th July ±932. I regret I find it difficult to furnish any new information, in the matter as your despatch Bo. ]?.367 -a/ 31 of the 4th May 1932 is complete. The reason for the apparently gradual increase in the cost of the Buildings has Been shown to have Been due to the omission of the servants quarters from the original figures suBmitted to the Secretary of State. The chief item in the construction is Burnt Bricks masonry work which is estimated to need nearly half the total sum (viz Es.60,000/- out of Es. 1,36,817/-). Burnt Bricks alone can Be used for this cons truction and they have to come from Iraq. In this connection the Assistant Engineer specially visited Basrah to obtain this information. following certain suggestions made By the Chief Engineer, Simla a modification in the cost equal to some Es.2793/- was effected, (please see my Express Letter Ho.202 of the 27th January 1932). B'O thBoth Sir Hugh Biscoe and Colonel Dickson gave this matter their personal attention and every endeavour was made to cut down the cost.

But before agreeing to do so, they pressed us very hard demi-officially over the relatively high cost of the new building and over the gradual increase in successive estimates over a period of years, and we had some difficulty in dissuading them from a suggestion that the whole question of cost should be further examined in India. They finally agreed, in view of the urgency, to accept the revised estimate, but intimated that, while they felt sure that the Government of India, who they recognised were equally interested financially, were satisfied that the estimate in question was in the circumstances reasonable, they would appreciate any supplementary information which could be obtained bearing upon the relatively high cost of providing the new accommodation. 2. The Government of India's air mail/ 617mail letter of 4th May does of course go to show that the relatively high cost of this house is probably to a large extent the result of local conditions, and we have pointed this out to the Treasury. The special reasons which led to the increase in the estimate are to a large extent also covered by the correspondence of which copies have been sent from time to time. But if the (Government of India and the Political Resident can give us any further information which we can pass on to the Treasury we should be very grateful. 3.

Frankly, we here cannot effec tively check the reasonableness of the estimate; and it may be that the India Office is in little better plight. But the interests of your Department and mine are identical; and as you better placed to check the cost and test the standard to which the Works Department of the Government of India are proposing to work, we should be grateful if you would have the project further examined in that sense.

The size was again modified by thethe Chief Engineer e forks Department, to a square piece of la 138 feet. 4. In April 1931 a plot of land measuring 472 feet by 312 feet well outside the town and near the Diwaniyeh of the late Sheikh of Mohammerah was presented by the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah for this purpose. This fact was notified to the Government of India in paragraph 2 of my letter No, 1377, dated 1&gt;\ the 30th June $931. This plot is 1-J miles east of the present Agency.

It is submitted that the amended estimate be submitted for the consideration of the Secretary of State as requested by him.6. With reference to paragraph 4 of the Express setter dated the 28th December 1931 it is anticipated that not more than Rs*. 5000/- could be expended during the current financial year and the balance of Rs* 178316/- in 1932-33. Sanction to incur such preliminary expenditure up to Rs. 5000/- may be given as soon as possible, Sd* E*H. Gastrell, for Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.■&gt; Secretary, vvith reference to the Chief Engineer, Central r. /v.E’ s note dated the 21st December 1931, regarding tne construction of the new Agency buildings at Kuwait, 1 am to state as under;- 1. On account of the soft nature of bricks manuiactured. at Shafi and Amarah, it is recommended not to reduce the thickness of the walls, without testing their strength. The samples of these bricks can be obtained and sent for test, if desired. Moreover it is found that these bricks absorb water to the extent of 25 to 35% of their own weight, when immersed in water for 24 hours. 2. Trie rates for the doors and windows have been carefully worked out, and they are the lowest possible. It is submitted trial the rates allowed in the Gulf cannot be compared with the rates prevailing in India. In fact, it is not the material, but the labour which renders the rates to appear considerably high. Eor instance, the wages of a carpenter in r Kuwait is between Rs. 4/- to Rs. 6/- per day, and when compared with an Indian carpenter he is found to be a very poor workman. 3. The design of the floors and roofs consisting of bricks and T-irons has not been adhered to, on account of the soft nature of bricks and the use of T-irons, The latter, wherever used in the Gulf, have proved unsatisfactory. They are subject to expansion and contraction according to trie variation in the temperature and begin to get rusted and deteriorate rapidly. The beams have now been widely spaced (i.e. 6’ apart) and the amount of Estimate reduced by Rs. 2660/-. 4.I 4. On all important buildings Amarali bricks are used on face work, as Shafi bricks are of poor quality and show efflorescence due to soluble salts in the clay of which they are made. Therefore the use of Shafi bricks on face work is not recommended. Sd. Illegible, 27-1-32. Assistant Engineer. Sd. E.H. Gastrell, 27-1-32. Captain. -:r*'■' —r &gt;7 nute PfipGi'.

I In their letter of 17th July 1930, (P*4899/30, flagged ) the Government of India ashed that His Majesty’s Government might be moved to accept a moiety of a total estimate of Bs.1,56,100, of which Rs.1,40,000 was for the construction of new buildings for the Political Agency at Kov/eit, Rs. 15,100 (reducible by Rs. 1,500 if one of the existing outhouses could be utilized as an engine room) for providing a suitable electrical plant and installation, which were to be utilized both for the present buildings and for the re w buildings, and Rs.1,000 to cover the loss on the wiring of the present buildings which could not be transferred to the new buildings. In their letter of 5th January 1931 (P.Z.133/ flagged) the Foreign Office concurred with the Treasury in accepting a moiety of the cost on the understanding (a) that the Government of India agreed that Koweit was absolutely excluded as a possible site for the Persian Gulf Residency and (b) that any substantial increase in the estimate of Rs.1,56,100 would be submitted for prior consideration by the Treasury. These conditions were repeated to the Government of India in the India Office telegram of 9th January sanctioning the Government of India's proposal. /!?/?/) In their letter of 4th August 1931 to the Political Resident (P.Z.5413/31 flagged ) the Government of India sanctioned the installation of electric plant, fans and lights at an estimated cost of Rs.15,140 to be met by reappropriation out of the provisicn of Rs.1,04,000 made in the budget estimates for 1931-32 for the construction of new Agency buildings at Koweit; but later/i ,\r later in their letter of 30th November to the Political Resident they accorded revised sanction to an estimate o Rs. 18,823, (P-Z-7897/31 fla^edj , being Rs.3,680 in excess of the original estimate owing to increase in the nrices of “plant and machinery on account of increase in import duty and depreciation of certain exchc-nges since the original estimate was sanctioned, A t the same time they asked that all possible efforts should be made to effect a corresponding saving in the main estimate fo^r the new Agency buildings (see paragraph 5 of their lette The Foreign Office have asked for observations on this letter of the Government of India, J In view of the Government of India express let of 10th December to the Political Resident flagged at P.Z.8031/31 and mere especially in view of their express letter of 28th December (P.Z.385/32) which has just been received in which they say n it is necessary that the cost of the scheme including the electric installation should not exceed the amount approved of by the Secretary of. t te, viz : Rs.l,56,IQQ' . it is proposed to tell the Foreign Office that we consider that the Government of India have no intention without prior approval of exceeding oy an appreciable amount the estimates sanction L-itfty. f r /f £) ;er ed** — '*»*-— ' 35 r 3000 5.31 ^aft Paper.

A set of the blue print plan (as received from the Chief Engineer together with a tracing copy of the foundation plan and site plan (prepared in this office) is also enclosed for submission, to the Government of India, along with the estimate. It is pointed out for the information of the Chief Engineer, Central, P.W. D. vide his notes dated 3rd February 1931 and 8th June 1931, that the construction of the floors and roof is proposed as follows *- 1. The mid floor to consist of Rolled Steel Beams, wooden joists and planking and concrete on top* 2. The roof to have mud on top of the planking. A construction of the type proposed above has proved a success wherever used in the Gulf and hence can be safely adopted, whereas the roof consist of T iron and tiles whereever constructed has been found unsatisfactory. Ihe size of bricks for both the external ©nd internal walls is proposed to be 9 W x4-g w x 3 rt and hence the main thickness of and I’-e 11 as shown on the plan can be obtained without any wastage or cutting. As regards Drainage System it has been dispensed with entirely in order to keep the estimate within the given figure of Rs. 140,000. Water supply. In this connection reference is invited to para 7 of my note dated 19th March 1931. (attached) 2 Site Plan. A fresh Site plan has been prepared differing slightly from the previous one. The main building has been shown on the East Side of the compound, the tennis court on the West side and the servants quarters have been omi tted*alls'' ^ |^!3 omit uel. a.he reason ior this modification is that there are no huildings on the 3ast side whereas on the Test side ohere is a shipbuilding yard and noise of hammering eic., goes on throughout the day.

If an early sanction is accorded, an allotment of 5s. 20,000 will he required for the work up to plinth level. As the rainy season has already set in ijf*would not he possible to do more than what has heen stated above, in the current financial year. Since the work is required to he carried out departmentally another 5s. 30,000 would be necessary for purchasing materials such as, iron beams, wooden joists and planking, wood for stasaMKX doors and windows and sanitary fittings.

As regards the filling of the storage tanks on the ground, I am to state that the water is 'brought in sailing 'boats all the way from the Shat-ul-Arab, a distance of about 70 to 90 miles from Kuwait proper and is sold to public* The idea is to purchase sufficient water every day and fill overhead-tanks by pumping from those on the ground and run water supplies into basins and baths.

He gives the following reasons. A large store room alongside the kitchen would interfere with the through ventilation which the kitchen should have; a wide upstairs verandah to the drawing room he considers essential for the hot weather; and lastly he wishes that the engine room should he at a distance from and not form part of the main building. 4.

He has no electrical knowledge and his Assistant Mr. Roberts who is in charge of the electrical and mechanical plants here cannot be spared. Further, experienced wiremen are not available locally* It will therefore be necessary to carry out the work through the agency of a contractor arranged for in India. No contractor who could undertake such a work is avail&amp;ule locally* 4. In the circumstances the estimated cost of T, i 11 Al _ the project will be as given in paragraph 4 of Foreign 1351 and Political Department memorandum under reference* The steamer fares (deck) from Bombay to Kuwait are Rs.52/- with food and Rs• 40/- without food and from i i i ^ 1 11from Karachi to Kuwait Rs. 32/- with food and Rs. 27/- without food. If the wiremen and foreman are obtained at either of the above ports there would be a saving in the estimate on account of railway fares# 5. I would, however, point out that the estimate does not provide (a) for the erection of a concrete foundation for the two engines which will cost approximate -iy Rs# 15G/- nor (b) for the cost of mains between the Agency building arid the Medical Officer’s quarters which are about k a mile apart* The cost of (a) oould be met from the amount allowed 6 $ 5% for contingencies cr the savings resulting from railway fares while that of (b) has been set against the sum of Rs. 300/- allowed for unforeseen charges# 6 # Accordingly, 1 now submit two indents in duplicate for the requirements for the installation which may be scrutinized pending the receipt of the lay ou|j plan and sketch plan of the buildings# These will be forwarded in a fortnight's time. 7* The Estimate for Rs. 13,6 00/- is returned herewith# (sd) T*C*W.

ENGLOBUu INDIA FOREIGN G o Died 15 APR. 1931 APR. 1931 Rscci.eafirst essential is to keep the house cool in summer, and it would be certainly preferable to give up the sanitary arrangements originally suggested by the Assistant Engineer and if necessary to reduce slightly the size of the rooms than to remove the verandah. 5. With reference to paragraph 5 of your letter it is not meant that the local Public Works Department will be eliminated, but only that the Public Works Depart ment should work with daily labour. I quite agree that normally this would not be desirable. The conditions however in Kuwait are such that it seems very improbable that any contractor would be willing to take on a work there unless he could count on a very large margin of profit, or would be ready to tender for the construction of the building at the estimated figure. 6. The estimate for the electric light plant is returned herewith and would seem admirably suited to meet the requirements and I should be glad if arrangements could be made for the installation of the plant at an early date* I shall be arriving Delhi on the 5th April and shall be grateful if I could be given an opportunity of discussing this case with the Chief Engineer. The estimate and plan forw'arded with your letter are resubmitted here with. Sd. H. V. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulfsecretary* Reference extract from the note of the Chief Engineer, Central P.W*D., dated the 3rd February 1931, / regarding the plan of the lew Agency Building at Kuwait. I quite admit that the design is plain and does not hold out much architectural attraction either from within or from without. But* I would respectfully point out that in order to render it look more attractive, it will be necessary to make provision for highly skilled labour which is not available in the Gulf and will have to be imported from India at an abnormal cost, and also to re vise entirely the rates thereof, which, is rather difficult to do without exceeding the proposed cost of the Building or reducing considerably the amount of acconmodation already provided* As regards the omission of the verandahs marked AA-AA I have discussed the matter with the Political Agent, who seems very much against the idea of doing away with the verandah. He would prefer the reduction in the dimensions of the main rooms rather than have no verandah at all. I am in entire agreement with the argument pushed forward by the Political Agent in connection with the provision of the verandahs as a protection against heat and cold, and would suggest that the provision of the verandahs made by me should be up-he Id. Taking into consideration the cut in the dimensions of the main rooms, agreed upon oy the Political Agent, 1 believe it would be possible to reuuoe the plin area by about 1354 S.Ft., and thus bring the cost do® to Rs. 1,49,500/-* Besides the deletion of the item of plank u. 4 . oo ^ oaG from the estimate altogether ceiling costing about Rs* 3,QG the Political Agent has agreed to the use or Commodes and do away with the expensive system oi disposing o+f nig soil by means of drainage and sumps and thus make itit possible to reduce the cost by a further sum of about Rs.2,000/-* All these aforesaid modifications will bring the total cost of the Building down to Hs. 1,45,000 or so* Excepting the above, no other reduction in the cost can possibly be made, without curtailment of the accommodation. This, if accepted, would require the plans and estimates being revised afresh on the lines of above modifications. As regards the filling of the storage tanks on the ground, I am to state that the water is brought in sailing boats, all the way from Shatt-ul-Arab, a distance of about 70 to 90 miles from Kuwait proper and is sold to public. The idea is to purchase sufficient water every day and fill overhead-tanks by pumping from those on the ground and run water supplies into basins and baths. As the supply of water is an expensive item in Kuwait, the Political Agent has decided to run down and collect the water used in basins and baths, in suitable tanks or ground, and re-use it for gardening purposes. With regard to the site plan, it is submitted that in August last when I went to Kuwait the land for the building was not yet acquired. It was then only selected, and, as such I could not prepare a proper plan. The land has now been actually required, and a site plan is submitted herewith. Sd.

Tnis excess j is almost entirely a c counted for by the addition at the bscx of the house of a verandah which would add very greatly uO its j ameni ties.

It would obviously be preferable to construct toe whole building simultaneously but I consider the present plan so infinitely superior to the original plan H that it would be preferable to construct it piece meal rather than to construct the house on the lines of plan II. if the verandah is eliminated for Jie present, a sweepers 'balcony v/ould be provided instead, the cost of which would be small. Owing to the difficulties of obtaining good contractors to undertake uhe v\orlc at a place lilce Kuwait X would recommend that the house should be built departmentally. If this is approved ana sanction is accorded to the plans and estimates by the end of January 1931, it will be possible to spend Rs. 20,000 during the current financial year in the purchase of material# etc#, and I would request that the necessary funds be provided.

The building stone available at Kuwait is coral and is worked out with crow bars from the bed of the sea at low tide. Being impregnated with sea water, it deteriorates gradually, and is therefore not recommended for use in the Agency building proper* 3* as regards cement concrete construction, this would necessitate import of skilled labour from India, as local masons have no experience of this form oi construction* 4.

The arguments against extending this arrangement to Koweit were considered here at the time. The case of Koweit is at most analogous to those which arise in the suggested -'Indian sphere' in Persia. But it was felt that the need for a new building at Koweit is so urgent that it might not be desirable to delay putting the work in hand while we have a possibly protracted argument with the F. 0. We consequently informed the G.of I. that we were prepared, if they agreed, to accept the view^ which had been communicated to us d.o. by the F.O.

The most convenient course would he that a revised statement of expenditure should he furnished embodying the additional information required. 2. The increase in expenditure in 1907-08 is very considerable, amounting, even after deduction of the special payment of Rs.60,000 in respect of Koweit under the Agreement with the Sheikh of the 15th October 1907, to £8,135, and I request that, in addition to the information asked for in the Memorandum, I may be furnished with a brief statement in general terms of the chief causes of this increase. I observe that certain of the payments in 1907-08 are stated to include considerable sums in respect of 1906-07, but I presume that there were also considerable arrear payments in 1906-07. Some explanation is required of the continuous growth of the charges shown under the head of H contingencies”.^lay at lm perial po sts m Incloeure in Foreign Office letter) Persie 1 of 1st April 1909 (3194/o(). ) during 1906-07 and 1907-08 - ———» is enclosed for purposes of comparison. It will be observed that the total outlay in 1907-08 was somewhat less than in the previous year. 4. With reference to the special item of expenditure at Koweit, I have to remark that such expenditure cannot properly be included in a statement of charges incurred in Persia. But it will be convenient to effect in connection with the annual settlement of the Persian charges an adjustment of the expenditure incurred at places in the Gulf and its vicinity outside Persia which the British Treasury- have agreed to share; and I request that a statement of any charges of this kind up to the 31st March 1908 which have not yet been adjusted may be appended as a supplement to the statement of expenditure in Persia. I also request that this procedure may be followed in future. 5. It is extremely desirable, as I have said, that the information should be given to me at an early date. I have, etc. (Sd.)

(Krs.14,593) representing deductions, &amp;c. M Export Charges .- The explanation given of the increase of Rs.52,642.1.2. in the Escort Charges is not quite clear. The Government of India should be asked to state:- (a) The amount refunded to the Imperial Government in 1907-08. It is not clear from the statement whether this was Rs.26,280.1.4. or Rs.13,140.0,8. (b) How much, approximately, of the remaining expenditure in 1907-08 was for the first time charged in full to Indian revenues (in other words, what amount would under tne system previously followed have been shared by the Imperial authorities in the first instance or through the Account Current, and so excluded from the statement)? Special payment - The special payment of Rs.60,000 by the Accountant-General, Bombay, being on account of Koweit, should be excluded from the statement of expenditure in Persia, and arrangements for recovery of the portion chargeable to Imperial revenues should be made separately in accordance with the instructions in the last paragraph of the covering Despatch. Ssistan. Salardies. - The extent to which arrear payments enter into the figures of expenditure in 1907-08 makes it difficult to understand the exact position of affairs in the two years. If the expenditure in 1906-07 similarly includes arrear payments/payments, the amount of these should he stated* In the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the Government of India regarding appointments in Seistan, the term M Vice-consul M has apparently been used only of the minor appointment at Koh-i~Malik Siah, held originally by Mahomed Ashraf Khan.

Civil Buildings*- No information has apparently been furnished to the Secretary of State regarding the buildings in question.

Before the accounts are forwarded to the Foreign Office information should be obtained as to the amount of increase under each head which is due to this cause.

If not, particulars of the outlay omitted should be furnished. The date on which the expenditure in connection with Bam ceased, and/and the approximate amount included on account of Bam in the accounts of expenditure at Kerman in 1907-08, should also be stated. Kerman shah Supplies and Service and Contingencies,-. Some explanation of the increase under this head is desirable.

It will now be necessary to treat the outlay in 1906-07 as if it had occurred in 1907-08. Attention is invited to the omission. Pinaneial Department, India Office. June 1909m/m* (56 words) 6007 m.

The proposal to build a new Agency at Kuwait is at present unaer the consideration of the Government of India. I trust that a very early decision will be arrived at on this matter and that the work will be started at an early date as the present Agency is a most deplorable building both in itself and as regards its situation. It is situated in the centre of the t^n, surrounded and overlooked by other buildings and within a few yards of the seashore. It possesses neither garden nor compound, and along its front runs a public road where large numbers of boatmen and loafers of various kinds collect and gaze on the Political Agent and his family when they emerge into their verandah, they have no privacy of any r.ma, -^t -ow tide the smell of the foreshore is unpleasant while at those seasons of the year when the pearling lleet is preparing to go to sea and boats are being repaired, etc., one noise is bad and the stench of shark oil intolerable. rooms are small and low and must be appallingly hot in summer ana ohe accommodation is most limited, while the Political Agenu is constantly called upon nowadays to put up Haval and Air force officersatolfieers and others passing through Kuwait. An officer from His Majesty’s Legation recently visited Mohammerah and descrxhed the Vice-Consulate there as dilapidated, insanitary aiiu uniiealthy ^nd piornpt steps are oeing taken to improve that building and uo piovide electric lights and fans for the Vice-Consul. I hesyfitate to think what terms he would have applied to the Kuwait Agency, which is an infinitely worse nouse than the Vice-Consulate at Mohammerah. A senior officer of the Royal Air Force recently expressed his astonishment that the Government of India should allow one of their officers to reside in a building of this nature without amenities of any kind and I have no hesitation in saying that it is much the worst Agency that I have ever seen. When the climate of Kuwait is taken into account 1 think the necessity for taking the most urgent steps to remedy this deplorable state of affairs will be readily realised, 2. At the earliest, however, I imagine that it will take some two years before a new/ Agency is completedi 1 presume that when it is built it will be provided with electric lights and fans. In view of the conditions described above, however, I would venture to urge that the provision of electric lights and fans should not be delayed until the completion Qa n^w building but that a plant suitable for the new Agency should be forthwith and installed, before trie beginning of the summer, in the present house and transferred to the new Agency later on. The cost of transferring it would ue very small. The Shaikh of Kuwait has electric lights ana fans in his house and members of the local American Mission are also provided with these amenities. It is only the Political Agent, who has very much worse accommodation than the Shaikh or the American Mission, to whom they are denied. 3. There is no town supply in Kuwait nor is the-e any likelihood of the installation of one in the near future. It is, therefore, necessary to give the Polmcal ^ui.t , 11 * own plant, and many suitaoie plcUio 3 on Mie at very reasonable prices and the expenditure ma r ke t nowadays involved would! I l C\ Vvould not, I imagine, be lar^e I hmro -i, nave J however, no means of obtaining teciinicai. advice lie tp +■ i neie oat tne plans of the new house axe with the Government of India arir ] 4 . _ - '' iU u would doubtless be possible for them to obtaan expert opinion regarding a suitable instillation .lor a house of the size which they propose to build. I WO uld suggest that the plant should fulfil the folio, ^ ^ 10 Ilowing conditions j firstly, the engine should be of a simple and robust design capable of being looted after by the driver of the Kuwait launch; -jec^ndly, x woulu. suggest that, unless accumulators are provided two small engines should be provided rather than one powerful one since, curing the summer, electricity is required either for fans or lights during almost the whole of the twentyfour hours and one engine can'not be kept running constantly; ana, thirdly, X would suggest that tue engine provided should oe automatically started by the switching on| of a light; it is a very great drawback not to oe a ole to obtain a light if required any time late at night or in case of illness, etc, 4. The Shaikh of Kuwait has had a small plant installed in palace lor about live /ears, which has proved most satisfactory and cost between 4,000 or 5,000 rupees. It is called a Kohler, has two small engines and the first engine is automatically started oy switcning on a light and provides suiiicient power for forty lights or an equivalent number of fans. As soon as this number is exceeded the second engine is automatically started and provides power for an additional forty lights. A plant of this nature would seem very suitable for the Political Agency, and I believe this plant is obtainable from Messrs Osier and Company. 5. There is one further suggestion I would like to makes as soon as a new Agency is constructed it is proposed that the Quarantine Medical Officer, who at present occupies a small Mouse in the middle of the Town should move to another on the extreme edge of the town, as near as possible to the new Agency. 1 would, therefore, recommend that the plant provided for the Agencyr — ii, j - jmmm C^o) Agency should be sufficiently powerful to provide in addition, say, three fans and fifteen lights for the quarantine Medical Officer's house. 6 . I regret that I am not in a position to submit any definite estimate of the expenditure involved, out as stated aoove I cannot ootain technical advice here neither do I know what design has finally been approved for the new Agency. ±1 my suggestion is approved, however, it will be necessary to provide in the Kuwait budget for a sum that will De required for the purchase and installation of the pl^nt and iox uiie expenditure involved in running it, though tiid.s should, 1 suggest, be recouped by charging the three consumers, namely, the Political Agent; Government (for fans and lights in the office); and the quarantine Medical Officer for the amount of electricity they consume,, Sd.

Political Agency, Kuwait, Dated the ntth Dovem'ber ±929. From Lt. Colonel H.PUP.Dickson,C.I.E. , Political Agent, Kuwait, To The Secretary to the Hon 1 ole the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Sir In reply to your Mo.2437 dated 26th October 1929, for warding copy of Express Letter Ho.F-58/a/29 , dated loth October 1929, from the Under Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to make the following observations on the six questions which the Government of India have put to the Hobble the Political Resident Question (I). It is not absolutely necessary of course, that the Political Agent’s Office should be in the same building as his residence, but it is very desirabL e that it should be, in my opinion for the following reasons (a) The site for the new house will be close to the sea-shore, which is low lying, and in consequence damp. It does not matter much if office rooms which would be on the ground tj.oor suffer from a certain degree of dampness, out living rooms should be on the first floor and entirely free from this danger. (b) The principle of having living rooms upstairs has been recognised all over the Gull and they are never placed on the ground floor, unless the house to be built, is some way back froqa the sea, or is on high ground, for example the Residency at Satazted or the Consulate^at Bajjdar Abbas»filed in the oil. ice 01 the Executive Engineer, Bushire, and pro hah xy exist v/ith the GOYermiient of India also. There would in addition, of course, have to be huilt in tne same coMpound as the Political Agent® s house, a separate oiiice building containing accomodation for the staff mentioned in paragraph (h) of the Hon*hie the Political Resident’s Despatch no.1844, dated lith August as well as for servants mentioned in paragraph (h) of the same letter. (f) On no account should a single storey building of txie Indian bungalow pattern be contemplated.Prom every point of view such building would be a failure and impossible to live in, both on account of txie nature of the terrain available, and because of the intense heat of txie Persian Gulf summer, especially during the damp months, which requires ^ buildings to be elevated to take advantage of V every land breeze. Question (II). Yes, all the rooms asked for are considered necessary. The Head Clerk should have a room to himself especially as he deals with inncn work that is entirely of a Confidential nature and has the Treasury in the same room as himself. Question (III), hot absolutely necessary, but it is desirable that Arabic records etc., should be kept,if possible in a separate room to English ones, question (IV). Most decidedly. The Waitin^Boom is intended for petitioners and for persons desirous of taking out Passports, for which there are about 250 applicants a month. Por the information of Consulting Engineer to the Government of India, the number of per- sons using the waiting room at Kuwait daily axid at tne same time is never less than 20. I have purposely made no mention of a Women’s Waiting Room or a “Court Room*’ both of which could justifiably be included, I think.^.Hece iJ ^ior L Rooxu i s a roora intended to te furnished as an Arab drawing rooaa for receiving his Exceliency the Sheikli, raeiiibers of hi=; fanviitr ^ ^ , nis lamil y» otixer guests of importance. The Sheikh calls usually twice every week throughout the year, and it is awkward as well as un desirable to have to take him and his entourage every time up to ones private apartments and hide away ones family in another part of the house, this is especially so as his visits usually last as long as an hour and a half. Question (V), The question of the size of rooms was very carefully considered ty my predecessor and myself at the time the plans submitted were drawn up, and I have little to add what the Hon’ble the Political Resident stated in paragraph if) of his letter ila .1844 dated nth August on the subject; 1 do not see how 70 guests can be accommodated in a drawing room 25* x 20* or given dinner in a room of that size, / Question (VI). Mo, decidedly not. These verandahs ^ are used as living rooms during the summer, especially in the damp season, when the wet bulb and dry bulb stand at the same level and tne slightest draught or breez.e is eagerly sought for. Whatever happens, neither the H inner’’ through verandahs nor those running round the house should be built of less width than 12 feet. 1 know of no verandahs f in the Gulf less than 14' in width, many are twice as broad. It would be a great mistake, I think, to start experimenting with what the experience of nearly 100 years in the Gulf has taught us in this respect. 3?rom the correspondence which has gone on with regard to the proposed new Agency , one isi&amp;y conclude that the Government of India find the cost of Plan I as well as Plan II rather excessive and are endeavouring to get something- upmipimniftMi something cheaper bmlt. kight I offer the suggestion, tne re j. ore, 'both to avoid further delay? and in the interests of economy, tnat the Goverm^ent of India inform me exactly what amount ox money tney. are prepared to allot for the purpose and then permit me to worx out with a good local Persian builder what can be built for the money, and then let me carr&gt; out the work of build ing the new Agency myself. I believe that this method is adopted at Unseat with regard to new buildings*! personally think 1 can get a house according to Plan No. I built for about Ks. 1,30,000/- and one according to Plan ho. II for about 1(3.1,00,000/-. Tie only assistance I should require would be a good Sub Overseer to supervise the Contractor’s work, the loan of whom might be arranged froip India direct. I belueve Es. 50,000 can be saved by this method. Another suggestion might also be put iorward for the Government of India. If thep are inclined to favour plan No. II, I think, expense may ce reduced, ;-! instead of adhering exactly to the Plan which was in tended to be an improvement on tne Bahrain Agency tuey adopted the Bahrain building as it stands today, as their model, making only one or two very minor improve- merits which would cost little. By so doing we should eliminate the drawing room and Political Agent's si-ud^i underneath it and turn the Bast wing spare room into the Drawing room, and the Court Room under it into t&amp;e Political Agent's study: lie should lose entirely tne Best spare room but would gain a nice glassed-m verandah running round the whole inside bay of the front portion of the house.

If there is any likelihood of works being commenced on the new Agency Building during the coming Autumn so that it is completed by the winter of 1930-31 I agree with Colonel Dickson that it would be more economical to continue in the present house till then, merely carrying out such essential repairs, which Colonel Dickson estimates at Rs.1,800, as will render the house weather proof and secure.

IV* io avoid any possible danger of future misunderstand ing however, it would be advisable to commence by making one or two points clear. These i shall enumerate below in the form of sub-paragraphs:-- (a) Before any work is done, and on the assumption that Government will agree to us.6000/- being spent, the ugent here iwho is incidentally the xmle^s Wazir, idaan r&gt;ah&amp;dur Milla Balih; desires that the formal sanction of the shaikh of Mohammerah he taken through nis majesty's minister at Tehran, to the house being occupied for 18 months, and to structural alterna tions such as knocking six room into three, erection of a garage, building of fire places, bath rooms, kitchen, pantry etc. etc. to suit a European occupant, being carried out: This is a necessary preliminary. ^) it is also desirable to make it quite clear to the Government of India that the house will be the Political Agent’s residence only, it being impracticable to move the Political .agent’s and clerks 5 offices from their present site in the old Agency in the Town. Indeed ii.l. the Kuler has made a special request to the Political Agent tnat in the event of his moving outside the Town the offices be left where they are now as it will be quite impossible for poor peopls and otxieis xequiring passport visas, certificates of identity etc. etc. ^amounting to some thirty per day; to go to 2 miles out of the city for the prupose, especially cturing summersummer \c) As the transl er of the rolitical Agents house &amp;o a spot 2 miles from the town and 2% miles from the hazaar, will entail great hardship for servants and chaprasis, who all are married men and live in the heart of the town, it is reasonable and fair that such servants be granted an increase of ns•25^4 on their present pa/. These increases to include 4 viovernment farashes or peons, 1 Government sweeper Total extra cost per month its. 42/- (d) It will be also necessary for Government to sanction ^new bic/cles, be replaced at the beginning of ever/ 3rd /ear) for the use of the above servants to enable them to carry messages, papers, telegrams etc. to the town office, ohaihh f s Town falace, and Telegraph office and back. These will cost ns.300/- in the first instance. i [e) Drinking water for the Town of Jiuwait comes from the ohatt al^Arab 70 miles away and is brought by dhow. The Political Agentfe private water bill comes to ns.50/- p.m. xhe same amount of water will cost ns. 150/- or three times as much if delivered at the ohaikh of moharnmerah* s house, it is therefore recommended that the rolitical Agent be granted a water allowance whilst residing outside the xown, of ns.lOO/- per month, a sum equivalent to the extra charge incurred. A similar allowance, I believe, used to be a “Government charge“ when the Political Agent resided in the old Telegraph building at bhuwaich to the west of the Town, and it would only be a question of reviving an old charge, if) As no Government transport exists in xuiwait and as the Political Agent would have to drive into Townat least once ever/ da/, a distance of 4 miles there and back, it would scarcel/ be fair to expect him to hire a taxi for the purpose and pa/ for it out of his pocxet. x would recommend therefore that the Political -agent oe granted a monthly allowance of ns*75/- to help him meet out of pocket expenses under this head, so long as he lives out of town. V* iaking items (c} (d) the last paragraph together it will be seen that the extra charges proposed to be met by Government are as follows* (nxtra pay of c hap r a/s is ns. 42/- Kecurri ng* (Water allQY^ance for Political ( ngent. 100/- ( (Gar allowance for Political Agent* 75/- Tot&amp;l Hs *217/- hon-recurring* Cost of 5 bicycles. ns.500/ - m other words in addition to ns* 6000/- being spent on putting the Political Agent’s house ito be lived in for l^r years) in order these will be a monthly recurring charge of ns. 217/-* both items must go together, as it would not be fair to either the Political Agent, or the other Government servants to ask them to go and reside at a distance from the Town, where the cost of living would at once rise to a point they could not afford* VI. Should the Jdon'ble the Political nesident consider the extra cost worth it, and can see his way to recommend the increases of pay and allowances mentioned in paragraph Tv above together with the expenditure of ns.6000/- then the work can be got completed before the winter sets in. it being assumed of course that a local contractor does the work under the Political Agent’s supervision and that the Public works Department have no hand in the matter.VII. M/ own personal opinion however is that if Government will guarantee to build a new Agency say by the winter of 1930-31, i can arrange to make the present Agency last for a period of another It years making it fairly watertight and reasonably safe at an expenditure of its.1800/-, work to be done by local contract under my supervision before the coming autumn sets in. ihe money to be spent on recovering the whole roof less the lining Room, under pinning the walls supporting the drawing room and bed-room next to it, and building four flying buttresses to present the front walls of the building falling out ^which they are in eminent danger of doing). The expenditure will of course be wasted money in the long run as on the completion of the Political Agent’s new house the old Agency will have to be pulled down and reconstructed to suit the medical Officer here. VIII. it becomes then a question of spending as. 6000/- or Rs.1800/- now , and i submit that Government should be asked to definitely decide now whether they intend building a new Agency in nuwait by the winter of 1930-31 or not. T’or on their decision depends everything, ohould they decide against a new Agency now, then the only possible course will be for the Political Agent to expend the as. 6000/- on the bhaikh of mo hammer ah* s house and for the extra allowances to be sanctioned, but the solution could never be more than a temporary one. IX. It is much regretted that this reply has not been furnished by me earlier but the recent serious political situation in the Desert has prevented my attending to the matter earlier.

A point also to be remembered is that several official receptions and functions are held in the Political Agents drawing room at which the Muler and his entourage are present while as aany as 70 prominent shaikhs and other citizens are entertained nin mi 'to dinner on i\iyi£r^c! t-4Tx4'V&gt;''»^ i on s isirthaa/ and other important festivals• IgJ i»s regards the remark that one plan provides for a large nail while the other has no hall at all, i would observe that rlan 1 as the more expensive of the two has been given a hall. ihis flan was considered by the late Political agent who had nine years experience of nuwait, to provide the better and more suitable house for Kuwait. rl&amp;n II the less expensive has been submitted as a cheaper alternative and consequently dispenses with the provision of a hall* ifr) ihe srze of the servants hall is larger in Plan 1 than in Plan li but that is due to the more libera,! scale on which tne Plan is framed* in Plan rl 1 uo not consider the size excessive. ihe room has to accommodate the private servants tbutler and kitmagar; of the Political Agent when not on duty upstairs, as well as the office menials* In the cold weather all the servants congregate in the waiting room and are summoned by electric bell. 1 forward herewith a copy of an extract from the late Political Agent*s report on the provision of an Agency building at Kuwait. nis remarks may be useful in deciding upon the final plan to be adopted* The two Plans are returned herewith the .worth point marked in each* In addition to the main building it will be necessary to provide for the following servants quarters and outhouses:- Garage for 2 cars btables for 2 horses* Quarters for 2 byces Quarters for 2 married servants Quarters for 2 unmarried servants Quarters for 1 sweeper Quarters for 1 rhobi Quarters for a motor mechanic ^married]*in conclusion 1 trust that the Government of India will see their way to give this matter their early attention with a view to carrying the work of the new building through as early as possible* i'he posting to nuwait for the first time of an Officer who is accompanied by his children has emphasised the extreme inconveniences and hardships of the present conditions and in the interests of the service as well as the prestige of nis majesty*s representative it is essential that the Political Agent should be better housed. i had the misfortune to be housed in the Kuwait Agency in the summer of 1927 and 1 speak from bitter experience. 1 have, etc., od. (j.o.J. x&gt;arrett, political resident in the rersian Gulfextract from a memorandum i,o.483 aated the 11th lebruar/ 19*9 from the Political ^gent, x,uwait to the secretary to the non'tole the Political Kesident in the Persian ttulf, iushire. 11. seiore aeciding on the type of building, it is most impoit&amp;nt to consider the climate of huwait and the uses to which it wixl be put. as regards the former, i cannot too strongly impress upon you that the clim ate^ o f huwait hears no that of Bahrain or ru shire. and that any argument based on the assumption that it does is bound to oe faulty, unlike them, it is an exceptionally dry climate, and one can sleep on the rooi without any over head shelter all through the summer until about the middle of September, ihe summer in huwait may be said to about the middle of may, and to end about the middle of October. Out of this period the political Agent can normally get away for three months recess, consequently out of the nine months which he spends in Auwait each year, only two have to be passed under summer conditions, iruring these two months one exists , rather tirian lives , in any case. .crom sunset to sunrise one is on the roof; up till, and including, breakfast time it is preferable to be in the ver^iandah, and the same sometimes applies for auout an hour before sunset, and one probably indulges in a siesta of at least a couple of hours during the afternoon. j?or the rest, ail that one wants is somewhere vdiere one can keep as cool as may be • there can be no question of '‘comfort 1 ’ during the summer in this part of the world* nuring the other seven months, on the other hand, the climate is good, and for part of the time is ideal, and if one had a suitable house one could oe really comfortable. net the house, therefore, oe designed primaily for the winter, and not for the two months of summer, let it in other words as iar as possible resemble a JPuropean house, and not the abomination which one has to live in in India, withits one or more doors in every wall of every room, iwo rooms bed-room and a night-nurseryj might with advantage have both north and south windows, to enable those on the lee side to ue kept open at night when there is a strong wind, but in no other room is this necessary; and few rooms should have more than one door leading into a central hall. This is what one is normally accustomed to in ocotlamd or England, and most people pi'efer what they are accustomed to. a verandah is of course a necessary adjunct, and i would advocate having one all round the house, as one would then be assured a sheltered place to sleep on windy summer nights* The roof should obviously be flat, and might with advantage have a small shelter in one corner to sleep under on a dewy night such as one gets in late September and early October, in case one were in miwait at that time of the year. All doors should be single doors, and if possible the windows \ should have steel frames. in my opinion the ideal building would be one something on the lines of the British Consulate in .Dasrah* namely a two storied building with the residence on the first floor and offices below, having a large broad central hall and if necessary a lobby at right angles to it, on to which ail rooms would open, ihis hall would make an ideally cool place to sit in in the summer, and would also be most useful as an extra large reception room in which the Political -agent could entertain a large gathering of local notables as it is indeed his duty to do at times - and without such a hall he can only do so at great inconvenience, as it means upsetting his whole house, ihe resiaential first floor should contain the following rooms; drawing room, din/ing room, pantry, one bed room with two dressing rooms opening off it, a nursery* night nursery and nurse 1 s bed-room and two spare bed rooms, together with the necessary bath rooms and water closets - and, being so close to the sea, the latter might be water closets, un the ground lloor,trie re besides the ordinary offices and record should he the Political Agent's private room, etc,, office, and official reception room in whirh cil iie Ccm receive the shaikh when he calls on business, and other local notables who call on him, whom he can hardly receive in his office (at present 1 have no such room, and have to use my drawing room, which is most inconvenient ). There should also be a waiting room where local notables can sit while waiting. The larder and kitchen would also be on the ground floors and a small hand lift connecting the latter with the pantry and if possible with the roof would be a great convenience for serving meals, and its cost should be negligible. Any other rooms on the ground floor could profitaoly be employed as store rooms*illjOi'tV Eail i. t 13(14 ■ ' t 40*18 MOOUj .usjjog ii 9ii; S 8 9C ,83 Telegram i*. 110*2629-^, dated the 31st August 1929 jrom - foreign, bimla • to - To lit leal, Tushire* Uorrespondence ending your no. 1844 August 11th V Auwait Agency 'buildings. orovernment of India prefer continuance in present residence and have supported to oecretary of otate expenditure x\s. 1800 on repairs, sanction will be communicated on receipt, meanwhile please despatch urgently rough note of cost of new buildings which was attached to plans.. -Wo .1953 of 1929. ■British Kesidency &amp; Consulate General, uushire, the 25th August 1929.

Political Agency Building Kuwait. Sir, I have tne honour to state that on my recent visit to Kuwait i was struck by the extremely bad condition i or the Political Agents^-house which seemed to me to be in a most precarious condition. Since my return I have I examined the technical reports on that building and these bear out lully the expression caused by an inspection oi it. 2. The building which is over seventy years old is the property oi the Shaikh of Kuwait who has permitted the Political Agent to occupy it free or rent leaving it to him to maintain it. It is a two storeyed bunding having on tne ground lioor tne utfice ana various quarters and on the nrst rioor tne residence oi tne Political Agent. The building has within recent years been, examined and declared unsafe oy two different Executive Engineers, but I enclose lor information a copy ox tne most recent report which, though made by an Upper Subordinate, gives a more detailed description of tne building and its condition while arriving at tne same conclusions as tne Executive engineer. 3.

X would, therefore, ask that I be allowed to submit atonce plans and estimates for a new house and that provision be made for its construction without delay. I have, etc., 3d. 5*.T.Johnston, Political .Resident in the Persian Gulf.'° Py ° f 3 letter So - 80 dated the 3rd May 1928 from Hr. Abdul Wahab, Upper Subordinate to the 3xe cutive - ■ -i-A.e cut:i ve tilnFi pt Persian Gulf Division&gt; Agency Building at Kuwait- Report on - oeg to report that I inspected the Agency Buildings at Kuwait and have the following observations to make:- Tne ouildxng was built some seventy years ago, in the usual Arab style and to suit the British occupants, auditions and alterations were made from time to time. The ground floor consists of the Head Clerk's Oifice, vernacular Office, stores and kitchen, and the 1st floor Political Agent's Office and his residential quarter and within the compound there is a guest house, out-houses, servants* quarters and Post Office. k. Head Clerk’s and Vernacular Office floors were recently cement plastered, hut the general condition of the building is very had, especially the floors of the kitchen, verandah facing kitchen and verandah near Office. Hone of the walls are straight and they are all out of plumb. The absence of plinth and damp-proof course permits the ground moisture to perculate into the walls to the height of 3 or 4 ft. from the ground level, thus helping the deterioration of the mud masonry. These have been repaired by pinning and gutch plaster but the latter has in no way improved the condition, as the gutch has great affinity for water which in course of evaporation and absorption makes the gutch plaster crumble and the mortar in the joints also has crumbled to dust as pointed out by you in your Inspection Botes. By the crumbling of mortar the walls have become hollow and the former has added to the ugliness of the building. It is only to the dry climate of Kuwait that one has to credit the cause of the existance of the building and its prolonged life. But it1 ^ it does not mean that the building will stand too long. ' 3 ” ^ 1St fl00r exce ^ the front verandah which is ^9 paved oi Basrah square bricks, which are worn out, is in good condition as it was always kept under repair. condition of the out-houses is not so bad and the guest house plinth requires cement plaster and back wall gutch plaster. All the doors and windows require varnishing. 4. The condition of Post Office is bad. If the Post Office is to be kept in the same building, the floor at least requires renewal. All the door frames of the main building are out of plumb which indicates that the building is in course of slow setting owing to the crumbling of mortar. This also accounts for the small cracks all over the building. 5. All the defects and bad cracks pointed out by you were repaired by the Political Agent some time back and patched up works were also done by him, but all these in no way guarantee the life of the building for more than 6 or 7 years. o. In fact the Political Agent in his letter to the Secretary to the Hon f ble the Political Resident’s Ho.812/ 4/7 dated the 28th November 1927 has pointed out the necessity of building a new building with necessary accommo dation to the main Office and the Post Office. I think the Secretary in compliance to that letter has asked you/ to prepare the necessary urgent repairs estimate to the Agency Building, for which there is no necessity as pointed out by the Political Agent in his telegram to him. 7. I may add that the Political Agent had made a reference to his letter Po. 263/4/7 dated the 23rd April 1921 pertaining to the same question of building. Prom this I conclude that he has suggested to the Political Resident for a decent building in the near future.i T 0.ol4 of 1929.

Sir, In continuation of my letter Ho.187 dated the 25th January 1929 and my endorsement Ho.614 dated the 10th Parch 1929, I have the honour to forward copy of letter X\0.4/7/585 dated the 30th March 1929 with ground sketch irom Lieut-Colonel J.C.More, D.S.G., Political Agent, Kuwait, on the subject of the Kuwait Political Agency Buildings and would again ask that-I be allowed to submit at once plans and estimates for a new house. Two such plans (as alternatives) I nave already had made in draft form by the executive Engineer Persian Gulf Division, and only await your permission to forward same. I have, etc., Sd. H.R.P.Dicks on, Lt. Colonel, for Political Resident, Persian Gulf.Sir, I hctve the honour to refer to my te ley ran ICo.540 dated the 9th March and connected correspondence relative to the precarious condition of the Political Agency Building ^t Kuwait and to report that since then I have come to the conclusion, both from personal observation of cracks in the walls which are increasing almost from day to day, and also from the opinion oi expert local builders that the building sly is definitely unsafe to live in wet weather. The Public Works Department sub-overseer who was here last week, moreover, could in no way reassure me on this point, but agreed that if water weak into the walls as it may well do in heavy rain, a large part of the roof may collapse at any time. I accordingly venture to suggest the desirability of the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf impressing on the Government of India the extreme urgency of providing a safe and suitable residence for the political Agent. I consider that, in addition to a new residence for the Political Agent and offices for the Political Agency, which might conveniently be in one building, the following are also urgently required and should be deal t with at t he same t ime t a new house for the Assistant Surgeon, Itaaritable ^.Dispensary and Post and Telegraph Office which might conveniently form another; suitable quarters for two clerks and motor launchyjy launch driver, sub-postmaeter and telegraphist; together with the necessary servants quarters, store rooms, garages, stables &amp;c. A proper residence for the Ae^-i o+.. v - + o 1,110 Assistant Surgeon is a Tyim neet -‘ Iie 18 a t present living in an Arab house and, although it is sale, it is not suitable to a European's j. eq^:ira^ients; and the existing r'lp-r’Vof 4 . A SGi ‘+ clerks’ quarters are also unsuitable for their requirements. The ground on which the existing Agency stands belongs to the Shaikh but he has granted the use of it for as long as 4,0 reqL,lre lt ’ and ’ as the neY ' ’ouildings would improve the property he would certainly not object to them. The ground thus available however, would not be sufficient and, to carry out the scheme which I suggest properly, it would be necessary to acquire the sites of two or three small houses to the south of the Agency. As these are small and mean however the cost of this would not, I think, be great. In tne meantime I have carried out such immediate repairs as are considered necessary tcimke the Agency Building reasonably safe during the dry portion of the year, Viiich fortunately is now approaching, and I consider it a waste of money to spend more on it until the decision of the Government of India is learnt.

Moreover it is a very long way from Telegraph Office clerks quarters and shops which would constitute a seiious problem in Koweit where no Government transport is available*. Hinds.
