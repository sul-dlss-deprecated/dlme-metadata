The main correspondents are ministers and senior officials at the Foreign Office and the India Office in London, the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department headquarters in London, the Viceroy and Governor-General of India at Calcutta, the British Minister to Persia at Tehran (also spelt Teheran) and the British Ambassador to Russia at Petrograd [Saint Petersburg]. The correspondents discuss the harm that would be caused to the British monopoly on telegraphic installations and communications between India, Southern Persia (referred to as the British zone) and the Persian Gulf, in the event that the Marconi Company was successful in obtaining a concession (licence) from the Persian Government, with the concurrence of the Russian Government. Included in the volume is a copy of the Marconi proposals, written in French and presented by the Italian Chargé d’Affaires at Tehran to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1914. At the end of the volume is a copy of the General Post Office publication ‘Cable communication: further print of Concessions Granted in Foreign Countries accompanying memorandum of 13th October 1899, comparing General Forms of License for landing cables in the United Kingdom and various Licenses or Concessions for landing cables in British Possessions or Foreign Countries’, printed in October 1905.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Russia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Marconi Company Ltd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Wireless telegraphy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000be#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000be#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
