As a preliminary to this paper, it may be well to glance briefly at the state of affairs on the south-west frontier of Russia at the beginning of the year, and at the situation generally. There was an armistice, to terminate with the month of February, between Turkey and Servia, and a conference of the Great Powers was sitting at Con stantinople in the hope of preventing a recurrence of hostilities, and averting an impending war between Russia and Turkey. A portion of the Russian Army ^had been moblized at the end of the preceding year. Of this some details are given under the heading of Mobilization, and others under the heading Russian Army Details. The subject matter in this preliminary paper is grouped under the follow ing headings:— I. Narrative. II. Mobilization of the Russian Army. III. Russian Army Details. IV. Movements of Troops, Stores, War Material, &amp;c. V. Railways, Roads, Bridges, &amp;c. VI. Roumania, Servia, &amp;c. VII. The Turkish Army. VIII. Turkish Fortresses, Stores, Guns, &amp;c. IX. Miscellaneous. In the account for 1877, the above headings will be as far as possible adhered to, with such additional ones as may be required. I. NARRATIVE. The probable course of Russia in the event of her occupying the Princi- lities in the spring, entering Bulgaria and marching on Constantinople, hdVi^o- been carefully investigated in papers prepared in this office, it may not besuit of place to condense here briefly the form assumed by the various 210-1 woreports on the same subject, which reached this country at the close of last year, when the anticipated time of action was approaching. The belief in Turkey was that the Russian advance would be by Roumama and Servia, and also on the Asiatic side. Her plan of operations was said to he to force the Danube in as many places as possible. A strong corps would then take up a concentrated position near Bolgrad. The corps crossing the Pruth^would concentrate towards Fockhani and Galatz, the Commander-in-Chiefs head-quarters being established at the former place. - * S , **81 §B 1 .1 E One advance would be by the Dobrudscha. The natural starting point of this line of advance is the position Braila—Galatz. Little resistance was to be anticipated from the weak Turkish fort at Matschin; and the Danube once passed there or at Hirsova, the Delta is turned. Russian movements at the end of the year pointed to the passage of the Pruth at three points, by rail at Sculiani and by two roads from Kischenev. It is imperative on the Russians to send a force into the Dobrudscha, as if the Turks held that part of it which makes the right bank of the Danube between Braila and Galatz, they could seriously endanger the Russian com munications ; as the railway between those two points skirts the left bank of the river. The Russian force for the Dobrudscha w r ould probably consist largely of cavalry, and would seek, as soon as possible, to occupy Rasgrad, on the railway line between Rustchuk and Varna. It was reported from Kischenev in December that the bulk of the cavalry was moving towards Orgeiev, north of Kischenev. Generally, the situation at the close of the year included the following items:— 250,000 men, it was expected, would be on the Pruth by the second half of December. 84 field hospitals were being formed, providing accommodation for 52,000 men. The chief hospitals were at Odessa and Krementchug. Roumania was full of Russian officers studying the roads and the capacities of the country as regards provisions and accommodation for troops. It was estimated that the active army of the Danube would have 448 guns. The possibility of the main Russian force being thrown into Turkey via Servia w r as being discussed. General Rostislav FadeefF calculates, “ in order to settle the fate of European Turkey, in spite of the maritime powers, it will be sufficient for 150,000 troops to reach the Bosphorus— i.e., 250,000 men, on the broadest calculation, should reach the Danube.’’ When the mobilization was announced of the military circles of Kharkov, Kiev, Wilna, Odessa, and the Caucasus, it was calculated that the measures adopted would give at the utmost 250,000 men for warfare against Turkey. Probable allies of Russia were estimated as follows :—Montenegro, Herze govina, and Albania, 30,000; Bosnia, 4,000 ; Servia, 80,000 to 90,000 ; Roumania, 52,000. The Commander-in-Chief of the active army, the Grand Duke Nicholas, was seriously ill. II. MOBILIZATION OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY. The reserve at present consists of those soldiers who have served under the ancient law of recruiting, and who are on temporary or permanent furlough. 1 he reservists are called to active service when it becomes necessary to complete the efiecth e of the army ; this calling-out can only take place by an imperial ukase to the governing Senate.3 Exempt from calling out are those who are employed in the service of the State, or in towns and public offices, ati per authorised list, besides those who are ill and those under trial. The callings-out are (a) general when all, or a considerable number of reservists are wanted, and (6) partial when only part are required. Mobilization of 1876. An Imperial Order of the 13th November, published in the “ Invalide Russe ” of the 14th, prescribed the formation of six Corps d’Armee, numbered 7 to 12, composed of troops stationed in the military circles of Odessa, Kieff, and Kharkoff. A second order of the same date promulgated by the Minister of War decreed further the immediate formation of the staff, placed the Military Circle of Odessa under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, and the 7th and 10th Corps under those of the commandant ad interim of the troops of the Military circle of Odessa. Neither the battalions of rifles, sappers, nor the pontoniers or telegraphists have been classed w ith the field army, as the organization of the Russian Corps d’Armee is not theoretically known. The three military circles of Odessa, Kieff and Kharkoff, whose troops compose the six Corps d’j4rmee mobilized, have, under ordinary circumstances, the 3rd and 4th Brigades of Rifles and the 3rd Brigade of Sappers, stationed (in September) at Miejibouje (KiefF circle), Odessa and Kieff. The mobilization of the Russian army has been gradual. Confined at first to a mobilization in the Kharkoff, Kieff, and Odessa circles, with a partial mobilization in those of Moscow, Vilna, and the Caucasus, it has been since extended to all the military circles of European Russia except Finland. Of the Army-Corps above mentioned, the 8th, 9th, 11th and 12th were to form the field army, or “Army of the Danube,” and the 7th and 10th to form the “ Coast Army.” Orders were at the same time sent to the Civil Governors of the Districts concerned from the Minister of the Interior, notifying that the troops have been ordered to be mobilized in the Kharkoff, Kieff, and Odessa Circles; and partially so in the Moscow, Vilna, and Caucasus Circles. As all the preparatory measures for this mobilization had been taken some time before, all the reservist and furlough men having had previous notice to hold themselves in readiness and not to leave their present abodes, the mobili zation was expected to go on rapidly. On receipt of the Imperial decree at the various circles, orders for calling out the reservists w r ere at once issued, and according to official statements in the “ Russki Invalid ’’ with the following results:— The Imperial order was communicated to the 52 governments and districts on the 13th November, the following day being named for the mobilization to commence. / On the 13th November all the preparatory arrangements for calling in the reserves and for the collection of horses* were completed. By 2 a.m. on the 14th, the reserves at Nijni Novgorod w^ere already assembled and handed over to the military authorities. On the same day the assembly of the reserves w r as completed in seven towns. On the second day of the calling out, the assembly of reserves was finished in one government; on the third day in five governments; on the fourth in 12 ; on the fifth in seven governments; between the sixth and tenth days in 17; on the eleventh day in tw o ; on the thirteenth day in three ; and on the seventeenth day in two governments. * The Government has the power to take the horses of the country for the army in time of war ag’ainst an indemnity from the Crowm.I i* 4 The reservists, according to the same official statement, came quickly and cheerfully; the people also gave up their horses with willingness. The move ments of the reservists were much retarded by the unfavourable weather and had state of the roads. By an order of the Gth December the new Militia or Landsturm Law is to be put in force in the three southern districts, and the militia is to be called out to reinforce the troops destined for the coast defence of the Black Sea. The Militia is composed of men between 20 and 40 years of age inclu sive. The men of the Militia (ratniks) are divided into two bans. The Jirst is intended to fill vacancies wdien the number of reservists is insufficient, and can also be called out to form field corps of Militia. The second ban is destined to form corps of Militia. When the first ban is destined to fill up field troops, they must be called out by Imperial Ukase to Senate. Besides the 25th, 26th, 27th and 28th Mobile Artillery Parks, the 7th and 8th Horse Artillery Parks, and the 3rd and 4th Telegraph Parks, are to be formed. III. RUSSIAN ARMY DETAILS. The following details have reference to the six Army Corps, numbered 7 to 12 inclusive, formed from the military circles of Kiev, Odessa, and Kharkov.

As a general rule an Infantry Division consists of 4 regiments of 3 battalions (each of 5 companies). With each Division there is a brigade of field artillery of 3—9-prs. and 3— 4-prs. batteries (each of 8 guns), an artillery park, and a field hospital. The Division, with the artillery brigade and train, consists on the war establishment of 16,000 men, 2,540 horses, and 48 guns. A Cavalry Division consists of 3 regular regiments (each of 4 squadrons), and 1 irregular (6 sotnias). Besides these, 7 of the Cavalry Divisions have 2 regular H. A. batteries, and the remainder 1 regular and 1 Don Cossack battery. Inclusive of the batteries, a Cavalry Division numbers 4,076 men, 3,139 horses, and 12 guns. A corps of 2 Infantry and 1 Cavalry Divisions consists therefore of 36,000 men, 8,200 horses, and 108 guns. Compare the following Table :—8 Officers. Non-Commis sioned Officers and Men.

The Coast Army was then intended for the coast defence of the Crimea, and the parts about Odessa. The total number of conscripts drawn for the year 1870 is officially given (ft 190,000. Further, December information announced the probable mobilization of the military district of St. Petersburg!!; the actual mobilization at St. Peters- burgh, of four half-battalions of pontoniers for the Southern Army, and the formation for the same force of two new mountain batteries, and of a siege park of 400 guns, varying in calibre from nine to eighty-four pounders and six-inch mortars. As regards the Southern Army, it would appear that all the regular troops are armed with the Berdan rifle. A park of siege artillery of 92 guns was in process of formation at Chotin on the north-west frontier of Bessarabia, Whether these are included in, or are exclusive of, the above 400 guns, does not appear. It was reported at the end of the year that there were at Kischenev and its neighbourhood 100,000 men—40,000 between Balta aud Biltsy. There were also with the active army 40,000 non-combatants, e.g., ambulance attendants, telegraphists, postal employees, &amp;c. The total of the Southern Army at the close of last year was said to be 214,000 men, and that it was the Commander-in-Chief’s desire to have in Bessarabia a reserve corps of 70,000 or 80,000 men. This would necessitate the extension of mobilization to the second half of the Moscow District and to St. Petersburg!!. The field Gendarmerie had commenced its functions, and 160 men were attached to head-quarters. Much snow had fallen in Bessarabia. A division of the Russian Army was at Ungheni, and a large force distri- oiucu on the Rower Pruth and Danube, where provisional barracks were beiim erected. &amp;9 By the last intelligence the head-quarters of the army of the south were to be fixed at Chotin in the north-west of Bessarabia during the passage of the Pruth, and were subsequently to be transferred to Fockhani. The advanced guard of the whole force, when the troops moved forward, was to be composed of the second division of the 7th and the first division of the 9th Corps, i.e., the 30th and 5th Divisions. The following details respecting some of the more important Russian Generals may not be out of place here :— Nepokoitschitzky, Aide-de-Camp General, 65 years of age. Known as a good theorist.

MOVEMENTS OF TROOPS, STORES, WAR MATERIAL, &amp;c. On this subject the information received is not very full. What has come to hand, including that extracted from newspapers and referring to the period at the close of 1876, may be condensed as follows :— 22 large guns (1,600 lbs. cast) had been despatched to Sebastopol and Nikolaieff, and a large quantity of torpedoes to the former place. In Bessarabia large pontoon trains were being formed and sent towards the Pruth. Four large 12-inch guns had been removed from the ironclad “Peter the Great,” and sent to Odessa. Of these two were said to be destined for that place, and two for Ochakov. All available steam launches and boats, numbering about 26, from Kronstadt and from Nikolaieff with detachments of sailors in charge, were made over to the Army of the South, and prepared for having guns mounted on them. News about the 24th December described the Russians as in force at Ungheni, the Russo-Roumanian frontier station. Vast barrack were in course of construction there and at Faleshti, on the road between Sculiani and Biltsy, and commissariat depots were being organised at Bender and Tiraspol, between Kischenev and Odessa. Artillery material for the defence of Odessa and the Coast of the Black D10 Sea had mostly to come from the north of Russia, and their despatch, and that of stores for the Army of the South, had necessitated the stoppage of the ordinary goods traffic on all the lines running southward from the 1 olish fiontiei since the 14th November. In the middle of November the stoppage of goods traffic was announced on the following lines:—Warsaw—Terespol, Kiev—Brest, Moscow Brest, Tam bov—Saratov, Kharkov—Nikolaieff, Graen—Zaritzin, Moscow Kislofl; and soon after the Russo-Moldavian Railway was completely handed over to the Russian Generals. The Russian Government was pushing forward several contracts for war materials, among others the following :— One for the supply of 300 field gun carriages, and another for that of fourteen eleven inch gun carriages. One for the supply of 6,000 tons of steel projectiles for eleven and tweleve inch guns. A large contract for cartridges, and another for powder, both with American firms. Eleven, thirty-eight ton gun were ordered from Krupp of Essen. Rifles were being turned out as fast as possible in the small-arms factories. V. RAILWAYS, ROADS, BRIDGES, &amp;c. It would appear, from the most reliable information received in December 1876 that the railway organization proved defective in the mobilization of the Russian Army from want of sufficient rolling-stock. There is a break of gauge at Jassy in Roumania, and the railways in the latter province are 4 foot 8f inches, but the rolling-stock of the Kingdom of Poland are of the Roumanian gauge, and might be made available for a cam paign, reaching Rouroania through Galicia. The amount of rolling-stock, capable of adaptation to different gauges, available in Russia prior to the mobilization appears to have been small, perhaps 200 wagons. The following details refer to the rolling-stock in Roumania itself;— 110 locomotives, 356 second and third class carriages, 1,240 covered goods vans suitable for troops and horses, 600 trucks suitable for warlike stores. Of this, the bulk is kept at Bucharest. Bridges .—The iron railway bridge over the Sereth at Barbosi, called the Barbosi Bridge, between Galatz and Braila, is 254 metres long, and, if destroyed, would be very difficult to repair. Its destruction would seriously cripple the Roumanian railways, if not render them useless for the Russians. It is on stone piers with three openings. The railway on the bridge over the Pruth, and as far as Jassy in Moldavia, is of the Russian gauge, 5 foot. The railway bridge over the Sereth, between Galatz and Braila, is a point of great importance, as its destruction would seriously disorganize the Russian advance. In the original mobilization of the army, Baron Stiernwall, Chief of the Imperial Railway Department, was appointed to direct the transport of troops. The regulation regarding the suspension of ordinary railway traffic laid down that passenger and goods traffic was to be suspended when the number of military trains required upon the line exceeded 18 in 24 hours. A\ hen the mobilization began there were despatched from Kiev and several intermediate stations trains of about 20 carriages every half-hour, each carriage holding 50 men. In this way, 20,000 men were carried on the first day 18.000 on the second, and 12,000, including 4,000 cavalry and 2 000 artilery guns guns, upon the third. lo A\ork the railway lines foi military purposes certain officers were(5) 11 appointed to the charge of stations. A list was compiled showing the com mandants of stations on the following lines of railway :— Odessa. Kursk—Kkarkoff—AzofT. Kursk—Kieff. Kharkoff—Nicolaieff. Kieff—Brest. Rostoff—Vladikavkaz. Lozovo'—Sebastopol. Griazo—Tsaritzi 11 . Orel—Griazio. Tamboff—Saratoff. Morshansk—Syzran. Riajsk—Morshansk. K czl off—Vor one j—Rostoff. Kozloff—T amboff. Moscow—Kursk. Landvarovo—Romny. Fastoff. In the list are given the names of 65 officers appointed commandants, and assistants at 59 stations. Besides these, orders were given for the appoint ment at 49 stations of officers from the local or field troops of the respective circles. These latter officers were at the disposal of the staffs of circles. The railway line between Korneschi and Ungheni, a part of the Kischenev —Sculiani line, was reported in extremely had order at the close of 1876. Since the conclusion of the armistice, public attention has been con centrated on Constantinople, and there has been little intelligence from Servia and Roumania up to the end of the year. It was stated that the Militia would be called out on the 2nd December, and that 90,000 men could be placed at the disposal of Russia. The following account of preparations in the latter province appears in the Russian press:— “ Galatz has nearly lost its character of a commercial town, and has the appearance of a vast barrack. In it at the present time are 6,000 soldiers, while in the neighbourhood of Ibraila is concentrated an army of 10,000 men. On the 10th November orders were received for preparing quarters for 5,000 additional men. Notification has been officially made to the reservists that they will be with the colours throughout the winter. It is said that the Minister of War intends to raise the field army to 85,000 men. This intention is explained by the dread that the Turkish Army will assume the offensive and cross the Danube. For this reason the Minister of War has appointed special commissioners of engineer officers to inspect the banks and determine the points at which batteries should be constructed. At Kalafat will be erected a series of batteries. The Prince, Commanding-in-Chief, is expected in Galatz on the 20th November (2nd December). All the Roumanian garrisons on the Bessarabian frontier are to be considerably curtailed. A considerable part of the troops will be sent from the Pruth into Little Wallachia, presumably to Kraevo, where will be the Prince's head-quarters. The Russian “volunteers” had been withdrawn from Servia, and the Russian stores there sold or given to the Servian Government. The most trustworthy information available at the beginning of the year respecting the strength and distribution of the Turkish Army in Europe is somewhat fragmentary. The Turks were said to have at the close of last year 15,000 men at each of the follow ing places: Widdin, Rustchuk, Silistiia, and VI. ROUMANIA, SERVIA, &amp;c. VII. THE TURKISH ARMY.12 Tultscha, or a total of 60,000 men. It was estimated that 10,000 at Rustchuk and 8,000 at each of the other places, or a total ot 34,000, was more correct. In addition to these, 150,000 were said to be distributed between 1 ravadi, Schumla, and Varna. According to previous intelligence, as regards theii plans, they were said to intend having their main body 120,000 strong at Sclmmla, the numbers to be made up by drafting men from the forces stationed on the borders of Servia and Montenegro. At Rustchuk quarters were being prepaied for 20,000 men. It was intended to hold the fortresses of Silistria, Schumla, Rustchuk and Varna, with 75,000 Redifs (2nd Reserve) of 1st and 2nd Class of the five Army Corps of the Asiatic Division of the Army. At the close of 1876 the Turkish troops at the Mostar, in the Herzegovina, and Serajevo in Bosnia, were called into Constantinople, and the Turkish Army in Albania was broken up ; a portion of it being ordered to Bulgaria and the Danube, and 15 battalions proceeding by sea to Constantinople. Twenty-five battalions from Podgoritza and Scutari, on the frontier of Montenegro, were ordered to Constantinople, and a large force of fresh troops—90 battalions of Redifs (2nd Reserve) of the 1st and 2nd Class—were expected from Anatolia. According to an official report, towards the close of the year, Turkey about the time of the beginning of the armistice had 480 battalions under arms, 315 in Servia, Montenegro, and Bosnia; 18 in Epirus and Thessaly; 16 at Constantinople ; 12 distributed in European Turkey; 15 in Crete ; 4 in Tripoli; 12 in Syria ; 20 in Yemen ; 20 about Bagdad ; and 48 in Anatolia. It was then in contemplation to form 150 new battalions by calling out that part of the Redif not yet called out. VIII. TURKISH FORTRESSES, STORES, GUNS, &amp;c. According to intelligence received at the close of the year 1876, all the Danube fortresses, except Widdin, had been looked to. In Widdin there were 60 large Krupp guns and 85 others mounted. A military train of 1,200 wagons was being prepared. Two gunboats were added to the Dannbe flotilla. The flotilla on the river included 10 monitors, carrying 15 heavy guns. IX. MISCELLANEOUS. I he following details about Bessarabia, its military resources, &amp;c., are taken from the “ Neue Freie Presse ” of the 11th December 1876 “ The country around Kischenev offers no great resources for an army of 190,000 men ; it lacks the necessary conditions for the establishment of ^ood winter quarters. These conditions are only found in well-populated provinces dotted with towns and villages, well-cultivated, and intersected with a network of roads and rad ways. Nothing of the sort exists in this region. “Among the districts comprised in the zone of the cantonments that of Kischenev contains 3,190 inhabitants per square mile; that of Bender 1 260 • that of Tiraspol, 870 ; that of Akermann, 10,070 ; that of Bieltsy 1 200 -’that of Odessa (witnout the city), 630. The districts of Kischenev Bender Akermann, and Bieltsy belong to the Government of Bessarabia those of 'Tiraspol and Odessa to the Government of Odessa. . “In Bessarabia we find, according to the form of the ground two regions differing completely the one from the other. North of the line Gouragalbinskaya—Kaouchany, the country is accidented, covered with hills of considerable height, intersected with deep valleys with scarped and13 rocky slopes. The soil is clay and marl, covered with 2 feet of black earth of very great fertility where there is plenty of water. There are also forests which preserve to the soil its humidity and prevent the rivers from drying up during the year. “ The Akermann district, situated south of the above line, and the districts of Odessa and Tiraspol to the east of the Dniester belong to the “ Steppe.” The Steppe is a gently undulating plain, the watercourses running at the bottom of shallow valleys. It is perfectly open, treeless, dries up in consequence very quickly, which renders it poor in water. The rivers which flow into the Black Sea are for the most part entirely dry in summer, or rather they are dammed up into reservoirs or ponds for the cattle. The only rivers of importance are the Dniester, 180 to 300 paces broad, and the Pruth 30 to 100 paces broad. “As regards railways there is only one line, Odessa—Kischenev—Jassy. Roads, as we understand the word, there are none. “ The villages are mostly built at the bottom of the valleys, as there is no water elsewhere. The localities inhabited by the Roumanians consist of low clay huts of one room. The few German and Bulgarian villages are better. The number of towns is limited. Kischenev has 96,000, Bender 22,000, Akermann 33,000, Tiraspol 9,500 inhabitants. Most of the houses are of wood. Thus, of the 1,464 houses in Bender, only 148 are of stone. The winter is the most variable season. It is often mild, with the thermo meter above zero ; sometimes it is very cold with changes of 10, and even 30 degrees in a few days. Deficiency of barracks for troops; and impossible to make them in the south owing to want of wood. Provisions : Cattle in plenty ; corn also. In the south, fuel very scarce. Additional supplies can be brought by the rail or by the Dniester, which is navigable, or by the Black Sea, until the outbreak of hostilities, for the troops at Akermann. No good places for hospitals. Routes : Routes II.* (Bucharest), excellent, practicable for carriages at all times, and accompanied by a railway as far as Tecuci. Routes I. and III.* Excellent to Tecuci, thence country road. Routes to Galatz on both banks of the Pruth; country roads, practicable for carriages only in fine weather ; impracticable after rain. Pruth navigable from Ermanesti, and can serve as line of supply. Postal road : Bender—Kaouchany. Beyond is a country Steppe road, passing by Monzir-Kliastikaya to Bolgrad, a road exposed to all the rigours of the winter of the Steppe; from this latter place a postal road to Reni. Akermann—Ismail postal road.*' Three of these lines meet at Galatz, which is inconvenient, since the prolongation south is only by country road. The only good route is Route No. II.,* practicable in all weathers. * The reference in these numbers is to a paper prepared in this Department: “ The steps which Russia would take should she determine to occupy the Principalities in the spring.” Eu JANUARY TO MARCH INCLUSIVE.

Jan 1877. Trustworthy intelligence in January described the line of the Pruth as held in observation by two regiments of Cossacks, distributed in guard-houses along the river in parties of 15 men, each with an officer. There were then no regular troops. The Head-Quarters of the Field Army were about to be moved to Chotin (on the Dniester), on the north-western frontier of Bessarabia, near the point where the frontiers of Russia, Roumania, and Austria meet. The Grand Duke Nikolas, Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the South, who had been much better, had had a relapse, and was still very ill; so much so that there was talk of nominating a successor to him. It was stated in January, but the news has not yet been confirmed or contradicted, that Austria was preparing for the mobilization of three Army- Corps, each of 30,000 men, one for service in Dalmatia, one for Transylvania, and the third for concentration on the Save. In the meantime, the Southern Army was hastening its preparations for crossing the Pruth. Two battalions of sappers, and two of pontoniers, provided with bridging material, were cantoned on the banks of the river, and an experimental bridge had been thrown over the river at Leovo with complete success. Towards the close of the month, the question of superseding the Grand Duke Nikolas was again mooted, and it appears probable that the state of his health will make it imperative to supersede him, but at the end of January he was still in command. Early in January, several superior officers of the Russian Army arrived at Jassy, and made an inspection of the neighbourhood, to ascertain its resources for the provisioning of troops. Arrangements were made for fixing special tariffs for the purchase of victuals, and large stores of provisions were being massed at the principal stations on the Jassy—Galatz line. The health of the troops in Bessarabia and Podolia was officially reported in January as very good. Feb. 1877. As no serious movement of the Russian Army took place during the month of February, intelligence from Bessarabia was much occupied^ with rumours of the Russian plans. They (the Russians) were credited with the intention of keeping the army mobilized in Bessarabia, or even crossing the Pruth, with the alternative objects of exhausting Turkey, who was less able to bear the strain upon her resources caused by a prolonged state of preparation for war; or of provoking an attack on her part which would give them the advantage of the defensive. Meanwhile, the defences of the fortresses of Southern Russia were being carefully looked to, and the army was continually being reinforced. J Negotiations, consequent upon the breaking up of the Conference at Constantinople, were believed to be in progress between the Great Powers but at Constantinople itself those powers were unrepresented, save by subordinate members of the Legations. The Russian Legation was withdrawn altogether, and affairs generally at the Turkish capital seemed to be in a state of chaotic confusion. The Sultan had abruptly dismissed his Grand Vizier,15 Midhat Pasha, from whose influence in favour of peace much was expected, Fel) - 1877 * and who was the author of a new constitution given to his people by the monarch, as a concession to the demands of the Conference. Peace negotiations were understood to be in progress between Servia and Montenegro on the one hand, and Turkey on the other, to avoid a renewal of hostilities on the expiration of the armistice which was to end with the month of February. Early in February the presence of drift ice was reported on the Lower Danube, interrupting the river communication for the Turks, and compelling them to disembark their heavy stores and war material, destined for the various fortified places along the banks, at Varna, for conveyance by rail to Rustchuk, or over bad roads to the other points on the Danube. Simultaneously with this intelligence came that of the commencement of the collection of the war tax in Bulgaria. On the 11 th February, a military movement was begun which was stated to be purely experimental, to test the marching powers of the horses. At that time, thaw had set in, and the state of the roads was very had. The movement was called a military promenade from Kischinev to Odessa and back, a distance altogether of upwards of 200 miles, and there took part in it the General (Chief of the Staff) and Staff, and a force of Cavalry and Horse Artillery. The test was pronounced most satisfactory. At the same time, the troops about Kischinev w r ere regularly exercised in parade and other instruction manoeuvres, notwithstanding the daily increasing badness of the roads in Bessarabia. A forward movement towards the Pruth near Jassy, of 60,000 men from Balta was reported in the middle of February, but the report was not confirmed. From Bucharest, towards the end of February, spring weather was reported, and the departure of the snow : and from Vienna it was stated that a Turkish flotilla on the Danube had made a trial trip from the Sulina mouth of the river to Rustchuk and back. Other news denied the presence of any Turkish flotilla on the river. Towards the end of February, the Grand Duke Nikolas was again reported ill, and confined to his room. Austrian intelligence also relates that the presence of the large force in the south of Russia had caused great destitution and distress in the country, resulting in much crime. Constant rumours of a Russian advance were rife towards the end of the month. Nine bridges were said to be ready to throw over the Pruth, and the troops were constantly exercised at their construction; but the bridges were not carried quite across to the Moldavian side. The proposed Russian plan of action was said to be to enter Bulgaria at several points at once, so as to compel the Turkish commander to divide his army; and to enter with imposing forces, so as to invest the fortresses without weakening the advance. It was not proposed to attach very great importance to the Turkish quadrilateral formed by the fortresses Varna, Silistria, Rustchuk, * and Schumla. Putting the advance at eight Army-Corps, six regiments of heavy, and 16 of light Cavalry, and 435 guns, it was calculated that the quadrilateral could easily be blockaded without weakening too much the force intended to operate in the open field, which, moreover, would have a powerful reserve in Southern Russia. The Grand Duke Kikolas had taken up his abode at Odessa. So far as the weather and state of the country would allow, the troops forming the Southern Army were being constantly exercised in drill and parade movements, and combined movements in the field on a large scale were being arranged for, especially about Chotin, Bender, and Akerman, although the severity of the climate had proved a great hindrance. Other accounts said the army was composed mainly of recruits, and was unfit to practice combined field manoeuvres on a large scale, and that the parades, of which so much was said, were merely recruit drills. During the month of March negotiations were in progress between the March 187 Great Powers, having for their object to avert the impending war between Russia and Turkey, and, as a preliminary, to bring about the demobilization of the Russian Army. It was assumed that the Czar was anxious in the same direction, and only16 March 1877. desirous of getting a plausible pretext —“ a golden bridge”—to enable him to withdraw from a difficult and untenable position. Warlike preparations, however, were not interrupted. Lists were prepared at Kischinev of the numbers of troops, quantity of munitions of war, provisions, guns, stores, &amp;c., for which transport to Jassy would be required, and forwarded to the Roumanian railway board. II. MOBILIZATION OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY. Jan. 1877. I n addition to the Russian armies of occupation and observation on the Turkish European frontier, described under the heading “ Russian Army Details,” the following troops had been mobilized in January, but were not then as yet formed into corps, nor had they received a united tactical formation:— Feb. 1877. 1st Infantry Division. —Major-General Prochoroff; Chief of the Staff, Colonel Leslyr ; Head-Quarters, Lutsk. 1st Brigade of Field Batteries.—Major-General Simanoff, at Ostrog. 17^ Infantry Division. —Major-General Hann ; Chief of the Staff, Colonel Dennett; Head-Quarters, Kamenetz-Podolsk. 17th Brigade of Field Batteries.—Major-General Friede, at Litina. 18th Infantry Division. —Major-General Nabut; Chief of the Staff, Colonel Micheef; Head-Quarters, Tcherkask. 18th Brigade of Field Batteries.—Major-General Bogdanoff, at Jitomir. 35th Infantry Division. —Major-General Rail; Chief of the Staff, Colonel Agon Dovanofsky; Head-Quarters, Zastava; and 3oth Brigade of Field Batteries.—Colonel Feodorenko. It would appear that there was much confusion in carrying out the actual mobilization of a portion of the Russian Army at the close of 1876; that there was an insufficiency of stores and of transport, and that the actual strength of the troops was much under the estimated numbers. Great efforts were being made to remedy defects, and, before the end of the month, these were producing a visible result; but, by the most authentic January intelligence, dated about the 15th, there were only 118,000 men on the Turkish frontier, instead of 175,000, the official number. This force was then supplied with only two weeks’ provisions in the event of its taking the field against Turkey, and its means of transport were limited. According to a scale laid down by the Russian War Minister, the capital city was to provide horses, in the event of a declaration of war, to the Guard and troops of the St. Petersburg Circle, as follows:— Saddle horses, 637; Artillery, 2,492; for the No. 1 Train, 1,522; and for the No. 2 Train, 349; total, 5,000. It was reported, about the middle of February, that three more Army- Corps were about to be mobilized. Further details oi the original mobilization transpired gradually during this month. According to these, the confusion said to have prevailed was much exaggerated, and was due to the novelty of the experiment, and the inex perience of the railway officials, and would be unlikely to occur again ; and, as regards rumours that had been in circulation of defective stores, useless ammunition, empty cartridges, &amp;c., the only thing substantiated was, that while there was probably some foundation for such reports, the time that had since elapsed had been well utilised in making g'ood deficiencies. In Bessarabia, the soldier s rations were three-quarters of a pound of meat, three pounds of bread, sugar, tea, and vegetables. Many of the soldiers came fiom Bessaiabia, and were at home there, living in comfort, and the health of the troops was good. As a rule, they were distributed through the villages, from one to five in a house, and well sheltered.17 Among the mobilization and other details published in February were the Feb. 1877. following (many of which are dated January): — The Staff and batteries of the 4th Brigade of Horse Artillery of the Reserve was formed at the end of last year. The mobilization of the troops forming the Southern Army, under the Grand Duke Nikolas has, for some time, been complete. Such measures of reinforcement as are now being taken are for the augmentation of the strength of the existing battalions. Corps of Volunteers were about to be formed, including six “ Droujinas nobles,” two of Infantry and four of Cavalry, each having an effective strength of 1,000 men. These would be composed of members of the upper classes (la noblesse), following an example already set in the Caucasus, where there had also been organised “ droujinas,” composed of “ hommes du peuple.” This latter example was also to be followed in the south-west of Russia. The organization of the irregular forces of the empire was being rapidly pushed forward. Major-General Dandeville, long resident in Servia, was appointed to the General Staff of the irregular forces, on the recommendation of the Chief of the Staff of the Army of the South, and passed through Kischinev, on his way to St. Petersburg, to take up his duties. In February, there were rumours of the approaching mobilization of 12 regiments of the Guard, to reinforce the Southern Army. This would mean an increase to the latter of 54,000 men. It was as yet, however, a mere rumour. Another report was of the approaching mobilization of three fresh Army-Corps, to be despatched to Bessarabia, in addition to those already mentioned as said to be destined for the Upper Danube. There was, however, no authentic intelligence on either of these points. It was also said, in the middle of February, that six regiments from the Warsaw military circle were on their way to reinforce the Southern Army, and that all the local troops of the Governments of Kiev, Kharkov, Ekaterinoslav, and Kherson, computed altogether at 30,000 men, had received orders of readiness to march. Details of the original mobilization came to light from time to time during the month. It seems that, prior to the mobilization at the close of last year, it had been the practice of the recruits to undergo a training of six to eight months with the reserves, before joining the active army. According to recent orders, however, they were sent direct to the active army, and made up a good two-thirds of what was given out as the effective strength of the force in Bessarabia. Hence the marching and manoeuvres in which the forces about Bender, Tiraspol, and Odessa were said by the newspapers to be engaged, were, in all probability, mere ordinary recruits drill, which had not yet been mastered by the bulk of the army. It was stated that a cause of weakness in the Russian Army, and of confusion and shortcoming generally in the recent mobilization, was the absence of a complete knowledge, on the part of the War Office, as to the advantages likely to result from changes in organisation accomplished or contemplated. Among the Cossacks, tor instance, the plan to secure a uniformity of organisation between the isolated contingents of the Don, Kuban, Terek, and Ural had hardly taken shape, An order had been issued, prescribing certain details of organisation for the Cossacks of the Don, which were to have come into effect in 1875, but, after a short temporary trial, had remained a dead letter up to quite recently, when an attempt was made to renew them. According to this, the men were divided into three classes, regulated by age, passing from the first, the preparatory class (18 to 21 years of age), to the active class (from 21 to 33), and thence to the “ Ersatz ” (from 33 to 38). The first class received their training at home, which training was very pefective, from a lack of good officers. The second class were to receive theirs in the garrisons where the men were serving their regular time. Suddenly came the order of last year for mobilization, when the various Cossack head quarters received from the Atamans notifications of the numerical strength of the contingents required to take the field. Great delay then took place, owing to an organisation not too perfect in theory, and as yet only partially carried out in practice. When the two first regiments of Don Cossacks F18 Feb. 1877. reached Kischinev, the remainder, including detachments from some 60 regi ments composing the Cavalry of the Don, were expected to arrive from day to day, hut in vain. The two regiments which arrived first were, as it happened, according to the arrangements of their localization in time of peace, quartered close at hand; and, at the period of their entry into Kischinev, the mere order for mobilization had not yet reached all or nearly all the Cossack head-quarters in the wide-spreading Don territory. As a rule, on the receipt of that order, from three to four weeks is required for the formation of the sotnias in the various isolated places of assembly. At least as long a time is necessary to collect the sotnias at the regimental stations, when the long distances are taken into account. Then comes the march across the breadth of southern Russia to the theatre of war, not to be accomplished in a day, so that, under any circumstances, a delay was to be expected. On this particular mobilization of the Don Cossacks, however, other eventualities betel. Many of the men, anxious to prevent their goods and chattels going to ruin—as had formerly happened—during their absence, looked about for relations or friends to be put in charge of their households while they were away, and having taken this economical precaution, they then set out for their different rendezvous. From this cause the formation of the sotnias took at least six weeks. Another cause of apparent shortcoming, and consequent delay in placing this force upon a war tooting, was the perceptibly increasing poverty of the Don Cossack population. Government was compelled to arm many of the middle classes; in many cases to dispense with men bringing horses, and to overlook other defiemnees. From all this, it resulted that the expectations engendered at Kischinev by the appearance of the two first regiments of Don Cossacks were not realised, as regards rapidity of concentration. March 1877. The following information from the “ Invalide Russe ” reached this country about the end of March :— “ ^ ie order of February 19th last, directing the formation of eight Army Corps, allotting to them divisions of Infantry and Cavalry, and appointing their commanders, is merely a working* out of the plan for the organization of our Army, which was decided on in 1873, when the necessity was perceived of organising and strengthening our forces and means of defence, to place them on a le\ el with the requirements of modern warfare and the armaments of other first-class European Powers. In the year 1875 the Guard Corps was formed, and last autumn six corps (7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12,) were organised to form the Southern Army.

Eleven divisions of Infantry (eight of which belong to the army of the Caucasus) and the Caucasus Cavalry Division are not included in any Army-Corps.19 III. RUSSIAN ARMY DETAILS. Information, received in January, gave the following details respecting Jan. 1877. the Russian army. There were four corps on the line of the Pruth with head-quarters at Kischinev. The advanced guard was thrown forward to the frontier, and had with it two pontoon trains, each with a verst of bridging. The siege train reserve and ammunition columns were at Bender, the Engineer head-quarters at Kischinev. A fifth Corps was mobilized at Odessa, and a sixth in the Crimea. There were at Moscow and Kiev reserves to take the places of the four corps of the field army when they move forward. The information respecting the condition of the army in Bessarabia and its strength, received in the month of January, was very conflicting, the general tendency being to exaggerate numbers. The most trustworthy information respecting the distribution of the forces is that given in an official statement, which represents w T hat was known on the 15th January of the disposition of the Russian troops, composing the armies of operation and observation on the European frontier of Turkey, under the command of His Imperial Highness the Grand Duke Nicholas, Commander-in- Chief, whose head-quarters were then at Kischinev, and of Lieutenant-General Semeka, whose head-quarters were at Odessa, which agrees with the statement already given. In addition to what have already been detailed were the following troops, not forming part of the Army-Corps, but under the direct orders of the Commander-in-Ohief. Escort of the Commander-In-Chief. —Two squadrons of Kuban and two of Terek Cossacks; one squadron of each pair being of the Guard, and the other of the Line ; at Kischinev. Two companies of Kuban Rifles. 4th Brigade of Rifles, Major-General Zvietzinski, at Varzareshti, 3rd Brigade of Sappers at Kojnshna. 1st Brigade of Sappers (the Guard). —A detachment of 100 men : 50 Sappers at Kischinev, and 50 men of the Galvanic company at Odessa. Vnd Brigade of Sappers. —Its 3rd and 4th half-battalions of pontoniers, at Kischinev. Special Battalion. —For construction of military roads, &amp;c., in course of formation at Moscow. Sailors of the Guard.'—Two companies, at Kischinev. Sailors from the Black Sea. —A detachment of 200 men, at Kischinev. Terek Cavalry Militia. —Four sotnias, at Kischinev. Artillery. —Two newly formed mountain batteries at Kischinev, a siege park of 400 guns in course of formation at Bender, and a Horse Artillery Park attached to the Cossacks, not forming part of the Cavalry Divisions, at Kischinev. Division of Cossacks of the Don. —Major-General Shumsheff; chief of the Staff, Colonel Ivanoff; usual head-quarters, Riazan; present head-quarters, Duhno ; composed of the following details :— 21st regiment of Don Cossacks, at Papeluha; 23rd regiment of Don Cossacks, at Koduma; 2Gth, at Gorodishtchi; 29th, at Comrat; 30th, at Taraklia ; 31st, at Enikinbei (Kubei); 34th, at Labutna ; 35th, at Jabokritshi; 37th, at Serhi; and 40th at Gaidar ; besides the following—8th battery of Don Cossacks, at Tomdi; 9th battery of Don Cossacks, at Pestchanka ; 10th,20 Jan. 1877. at Kipintna; 11th, at Mejibuje ; 13th, at Pestchanka ; 16th, at Roono ; and 17th, at Mejibuje. Gendarmes. —Third squadron, at Kischinev. Transport of Mobile Commissariat. —Divided into 14 sections, of 350 country carts each, in course of formation at Kischinev, Pender, and Akerman. Artillery Reserve. —For the first line, destined for repairs only, at Kischinev. Artillery Depot. —For projectiles and powder, at Kischinev. Mobile Workshops.—At Kinchinev. Mobile Laboratory. —At Kischinev. Hospitals. —Within the districts of the armies of operation and obser vation are 30 Field Hospitals; 22 with horses, 8 without. The first 22 are as follows:— 48th Hospital, at Bieltsy. 49th Hospital, at Tiraspol 50th to 57th Hospitals (8), at Kiev (provisionally). 61st to 72nd Hospitals (12), at Krementchuk (provisionally). The last 8 are thus distributed:— 43rd Hospital, at Vinitza. 44th Hospital, at Balta. 45th to 47th Hospitals (3), at Kiev (provisionally). 58th to 60th Hospitals (3), at Kischinev. The official statement from which the above is taken does not give the numerical strength of the force described. For information under this head we have to depend on various and conflicting estimates. Probably more reliable data may reach this country by degrees. It is estimated that the six Army-Corps just mentioned number 216,000 men, with 49,200 horses, and 648 guns ; and that if four Army-Corps move forward in offensive operations, this active force will number 144,000 men, with 32,800 horses, and 432 guns. Reinforcements said in January to be in process of organization for the army of the south w r ere estimated at 110,000 men, the intention being to raise the entire strength to upwards of 300,000 men. About the middle of January news came of the reinforcement of the Regular Cavalry of the Southern Army by seven regiments. Towards the close of the month, the Grand Duke Nicolas was said to have at his disposal a force of 200,000 men with which to commence hostilities, and measures were being taken for organising a strong reserve; this reserve, it was stated, w r ould consist of five Infantry Divisions, 8,000 Cavalry, and 150 guns, and be provisionally stationed in Podolia and the Ulkraine. Among the reinforcements reported to have reached Kischinev, and to have been sent forward towards the Pruth, were 16 Companies of Marines from Kronstadt and four of seamen. The anticipated movement of the head-quarters of the Southern Army from Kischinev to Chotin was reported as having taken place, but the report was not confirmed. Its outposts were stationed on the Pruth, the line of which appears to have been occupied from a point south of Chotin down to Leovo. The line of the river from the latter place up to Ungheni, near Sculiani, was held by troops thrown forward from Bender. In January, orders were issued for the formation of the depot battalions of the following Infantry regiments : 51st, 52nd, 69th, 70th, 7lst, 72nd, 141st, and 144th ; of these the 69th, 70th, 7lst, and 72nd Regiments belong to the Infantry Division, ordinarily stationed at Riazan and Tambov, in the Moscow circle, and not forming part of the six Corps first mobilized. The depdt battalions of the following Infantry regiments were described as complete in their formation: the 53rd, 54th, 121st, 122nd, 129th, 130th, 131st, 132nd and 164th. ' Intelligence from Bessaiabia in lebruary announced little change from the state of things in January. Eye-witnesses reported favourably of the physique21 and general condition of the Russian troops, whose numbers were given Feb. 1877. variously from 140,000 to 180,000 men. Judging, however, from the scale in which the storage of supplies were being carried on, and the quantity of Artillery it was computed that the Russian commanders made an army of 300.000 men the basis of their calculations. Various rumours were rife as to the sanitary condition of the troops in Bessarabia, generally to the effect that it was unsatisfactory. This was contradicted by an official statement from the Commander-in-Chief, from which the follow ing details are extracted:— The hospitals included in the statement were 34 in number, providing 19,922 beds, made up of— Two permanent hospitals at Bender and Tiraspol, providing respectively 415 and 207 beds; the hospital at Kischinev and a sanitary station for ophthalmia of 200 beds each ; and 30 provisional military hospitals, each of 630 beds. At the date of the return (January 1876), 13 of these hospitals were in readiness and provided with beds as follows:— The two permanent hospitals, 620 beds ; the Kischinev hospital and ophthalmia station, 400 beds between them. Of the provisional hospitals ;— Ko. 43, in Vinitza and the village of Strijevka, 307. No. 44, in Balta, 200. No. 48, in Bieltsy and the Grebovitsky Convent, 420. No. 49, in the hamlet of Kliastitsy, 100. No. 50, in the town of Orgeieff, 170. No. 58, in the town of Krementchug, 630 beds. No. 59, in the town of Tiraspol, 350 beds. No. 60, in the town of Kischinev, 420 beds. No. 61, in the town of Elizabethgrad, 420 beds; or a total of about 4.000 beds. Of these hospitals, on the date of the return, 8th January, the occupation by the sick were as follows :— Sick. Permanent hospitals- —Tiraspol • • • • • • • 297 77 77 Bender • • • • • • • 189 77 # 77 Kischinev • • • • • • 166 Ophthalmia sanitary station • • • • • • 163 Military provisional hospital, No. 43 .. .. 42 77 77 48 29 7 - 77 &gt;? ii 50 12 77 77 n n 58 402 57 77 n n 59 207 77 77 n n 60 318 77 77 n n 61 57 or a total of about 1,882 sick. This is not a large proportion if the strength of the army be taken at 180,000 men. Cases of Typhoid in no instance exceeded the proportion of 6 per hospital, and there were no contagious diseases. In the above return there appears to be a slight increase in the proportion of sick since the last official statement, which gave the number on the 31st December of the preceding year as 1,624, or about three-quarters per cent, of the whole force. Later details in February estimate the Russian force in Bessarabia actually ready to move forward at four Army-Corps, mustering 120.000 men, 8,000 cavalry, and 430 guns; and calculate that its reinforce ment by the two corps of the coast army would raise the total force available to open the campaign against Turkey on the European side, to 180,000 men, 12.000 cavalry, and 720 guns. From \ ienna, in the middle of February, the Russian total strength towards the side of European Turkey is given at 100,000 men and 28 field batteries, distributed on the coast of the Black Sea from Kertch to Akerman ; besides the force in Bessarabia, immediately under the Archduke Nikolas, distributed between the frontier of Moldavia and Odessa, and computed at 200.000 men, with 60 field batteries, and 300 siege guns. In addition to the above the reserves are given at 75,000 men and 10,000 Cossacks. G22 Feb. 1877. l n these miscellaneous computations from the newspapers of different countries there is a complete absence of details and generally ot such data as might be useful in testing the accuracy of the numbers quoted. # # . A statement from Bucharest ot a date near the last agrees with it in estimating the Russian strength on that side at 300,000 men, and speaks with special praise of the artillery and of the excellence of the sanitary arrange ments connected with the army. Subsequent information from \ienna, which is said to luxve been collected from various sources, and to be reliable, does enter into some little detail. According to this the whole Russian force on foot was 000,000 men, ot which half was pushed forward to the frontier and ready to advance. The mobilized army, at the date quoted (February 19) consisted of 20 Infantry Divisions out of 48; 3 Rifle Brigades out of 8 ; 9 Cavalry Divisions out of 20 ; 150 batteries of field, horse, and mountain Artillery; and a siege train of upwards of 500 heavy guns, or a total of about tivo-fifths of the whole army. This force includes that intended for operations in Asia, with which this paper is not concerned. The troops mentioned in the former Vienna report as lining the coast of the Black Sea from Kertch to Akerman are given in a detail which agrees in the main with the statement already put forward in this chapter of the army of observation, and are as follows:—4 Divisions of Infantry ; 2 of Cavalry; and 28 field Artillery batteries, besides the garrisons of Kertch, Ochakoff, Bender, Akerman, and smaller places on the coast, or a total of 100,000 men, of whom 80.000 are combatants. Details are also given of the force in Bessarabia, which do not differ materially from the statement put forward in this chapter of the army of observation. The ground occupied is that portion of Bessarabia which intervenes between the Moldavian frontier line and the Razdelnaya junction of the Odessa railw ay, and the strength is 8 divisions of Infantry, 4 of Cavalry, 1 Rifle Brigade, 12 regiments of Cossacks, exclusive of those attached to Divisions, 60 batteries of Field Artillery, and a siege train of 300 guns. In addition to all this an ample pontoon equipment and a contingent of sailors and marines are mentioned. The total effective of this force, including com missariat and hospital services is given again at 200,000 men. The reserve of 75,000 men alluded to in the former Vienna statement is said to be fit to take the field and enter the first line at any moment. It numbers 60.000 combatants,]and is quartered in the country betw een Kameinetz, Podolsk, Kiev, and Vladimir Volynsk, and is made up of 4 divisions of Infantry, 1 of Cavalry, and 1 Rifle Brigade. The already mentioned Cossack reserve of 10,000, numbers 8,000 combatants, includes some batteries of Artillery, and is made up of ten mobilized regiments of the second category. In addition to all the preceding, are 100,000 men, kept ready in depots to supply losses in the mobilized forces. It will be unnecessary, as far as the month of February is concerned, to recapitulate further newspaper rumours of the strength of the Southern Army. These have a tendency to exaggerate, but still they point to a continued flow of men to the Southern Army, and its consequent augmentation as regards the actual number present with the colours, without any increase in the number of corps, divisions, &amp;c. The Russians were said to be busy in February in augmenting the scale of their hospital arrangements. Large hospital establishments were about to be formed in the Crimea, and in the Governments of Kherson, Kiev, and Lkaterinoslav, and tw r elve minor ambulances in Bessarabia. There are, how ever, no data to show if these last were in addition to the hospitals already enumerated in this chapter. Eye-witnesses, writing from Kischinev, speak highly of the efficiency of the troops. The Cavalry of the Cossacks of the Don are described as regular Cavalry, the same as other regiments, and are armed with a lance, sabre, and Berdan carbine. Like those of Vladikavkas, in the Caucasus, they are also trained to act on foot. Their appearance is wilder than that of regular regiments owing to their having to provide their own clothes, horses and equip ment, except the carbine, which is found for them by Government. A description of a review at Kischinev mentions the following regiments as taking part in it: 53rd, 54th, 55ih, and 56th, all armed with a kind of Remington breech-loader, “fusil a labaHere.”23 Oi A February letter from Odessa details the garrison of that place and its l 877 - suburbs, Perdsip and Moldavanka, at one Infantry Division ; 6 Cavalry regi ments, and 126 guns. As marking the rate at which the ranks of the Southern Army were being filled up, a state may be mentioned, dated Kischinev, 6th February, which put the total strength of the force at 251,270 men and 482 guns, exclusive of sappers and miners, sailors, marine-infantry, hospital service men, pioneers and railway employes which latter number together some 8,000 to 10,000 men extra. It was stated in March that four batteries of field Artillery and two March 1877. mountain batteries were to be added to the Army of the South, and that the Artillery of the Reserve was also to be reinforced; also that the Cavalry force was to be strengthened, but no details of this last reinforcement were given. The reserves in Podolia and the Ukraine were to be moved nearer to the frontier, and the third ban of the Don Cossacks and the second of the Ural Cossacks were to be set in motion before the middle of the month. In March, the health of the troops was reported good, but there appears to be a slight increase in the percentage on the two preceding months, judging from accom panying details extracted from an official statement bearing date the 17th of February (1st March). According to this return the permanent and temporary military hospitals were occupied by sick as follows:— Permanent Hospitals. Bender Tiraspol Kischinev [Lazaret de la Compagnie sedentaire') .. Sick. 198 264 175 Temporary Hospitals. No. 43 . # .. 231 ,, 45 . # .. 150 „ 48 .. 252 „ 49 # # 74 „ 50 .. 160 „ 58 # # .. 470 „ 59 # . .. 302 „ 60 .. 325 „ 61 •• .. 364 Total # # .. # # # # m # .. 2,965 This number must be reduced by 449 men, included in this return, but sent by other Corps not belonging to the Army of the South. This brings the number down to 2,516, or a percentage, with reference to the effective strength, of 1*25. To these 2,516, however, must be added other sick in the ambulances with the troops as follows:— Sick. 8th Corps 135 9th „ . • 119 11th „ • . 177 12th .. . • • 170 4th Brigade of Chasseurs 30 Total 631 or an additional 0-24 per cent, of the effective strength of the army, making the total percentage of the effective strength represented by the sick in hospital and with the Corps ambulances 1-49. It may be mentioned in conjunction with the subject of the Russian hospitals, that an important innovation had been established in the introduction by the military inspector of health, Dr. Prisselkow, of Kirghiz felt tents, such as in the Khiva and Samarkand campaigns of Central Asia, had been used to replace the ordinary ambulance tents. These Kirghiz or Kalmuk kibitkas24 March 1877. WC re then found an admirable shelter both in hot and cold weather, and besides being in many respects more convenient than the ordinary canvas tents, were much cheaper. Each of these tents was capable of sheltering twenty men or ten sick, and five of them were ordered for each of the thirty temporary military hospitals. They were manufactured at Orenburg at a cost of 140 roubles each, to to which sum 45 roubles must he added for the carriage of each tent by rail to Kischinev, making the total cost of the whole 150 tents when delivered at the latter place, 27.750 roubles. There were also sent from Orenburg to Kischinev—with the tents a pro portion of non-commissioned officers and men accustomed to pitch and strike them. Two of these tents could be easily carried on one of the ordinary train wagons. Intelligence received in March described a force newly organized and con fided to the charge of Lieutenant-General Skobeleff, called the mixed Cossack Division. *It was really a Division of scouts,f and formed no part either from a tactical or administrative point of view, of the Army-Corps. It was an entirely independent force, intended to collect information and keep a good look-out both in front and on the flanks of the advancing army, to harass the enemy and disarrange his plans, and generally, to keep him on the “ qui vive ” by rapid evolutions and sudden attacks. Its composition was three regiments of Cossacks, each of six sotnias, a six-gun battery and a regiment of Terek mountaineers. This Terek regiment was composed exclusively of volunteers, all inhabitants of the Terek district and included in its ranks 170 Christians, the remainder being Mussulmen. When this regiment was mobilized it was ready to march in ten days, every horseman turning out fully equipped at his own expense. Subsequently they were given pay by the government, each man receiving 10 roubles a month besides his food and forage for his horse ; and they were moreover armed with breech-loading carbines instead of their own flint muskets. In one of the two sections into which this regiment was divided were 60 “aldars’’ or nobles, some of whom are described as very rich. Some of the officers could neither write nor read, but on the other hand they were thoroughly up to their work, were most of them decorated with the Cross of St. George and carried besides in the scars on their faces, marks of the many combats in which they had borne part. The officers were all good shots and anxious to be armed with carbines as well as the men. There were 25 of them, among whom only three, the Colonel, Adjutant, and Paymaster were Russians. IV. MOVEMENTS OF TROOPS, STORES, WAR MATERIAL, &amp;c. In January it was reported that large stores of barley and oats were beino- collected ; and of hay and barley at Reni. The Imperial Iron Foundry at Tula was commissioned to construct 40,000 iron huts for the accommodation of troops. An order was sent to Herr Krupp for 14—11-in. guns, complete with carriages, tor the torts at Kronstadt, to replace others sent to Odessa Iweive Russian gunboats were selected for service on the Danube. At the beginning of the year the lines leading to Kischinev from the north were re-opened for ordinary goods traffic, and this was taken advantage of bv the dealers m army supplies. All the shops at Kischinev were rapidly filled with merchandize and stores likely to be in demand, and many private houses were converted into shops. r Often alluded to as the “ Flying 1 Division f “ Eclaireurs.’25 Large depots of stores were being formed at Kischinev; and the other J&amp;n. 1877. depots of the empire continued uninterruptedly, the despatch of stores towards the Pruth. Intelligence in February related that preparations were being made in Feb. 1877. Roumania for the reception of large bodies of troops, at Galatz, Buzeo, and Kalarasch. Also, that a fleet of small steamers, to be used in the passage of rivers, had been collected in the South of Russia. There were said to be 16 of them of horse power varying between 6 and 20. The defences of Nikolaev had been strengthened, and the banks of the river Bug lined with batteries. Of the three circular ironclads possessed by Russia, two were in the Black Sea; one at Nikolaev and the other at Sebastopol. The third was at Kronstadt. Telegraphic communication was established between the Imperial Palace at Odessa, where the Grand Duke Nikolas, still very ill but still in command of the Field Army, was temporarily staying, and all the coast batteries about Odessa; and the bay of Odessa was so unsafe for merchant shipping owing to the torpedoes and mines laid down for the defence of the harbour, that it was necessary to station pilot vessels at the entrance to guide foreign vessels through these hindrances, and similar measures had to be adopted at the mouth of the Dnieper and the straits of Yenikale, near Kertch. The storage of supplies, ammunition, and w arlike material, &amp;c., reported from Kischinev in February was on a grand scale. An eye-witness, relating what fell under his own observation, speaks of a bridge ; of 13 steam launches large enough for ocean service; two large barges; five torpedo boats to operate against the Turkish gunboats, and a large accumulation of rolling-stock at all the railway stations. A thousand horses had also been recently purchased for the train. From Frankfort it was annonnced that the Russian Government had concluded a contract at Mayence for 150,000 pairs of shoes. It appears that the Russian Government was drawing largely on America for warlike stores, chiefly gunpowder. A letter from Philadelphia mentions the arrival at New York in February of 150 tons of gunpowder for immediate shipment. News from Kischinev towards the end of February was to the effect that the Russians had entered into fresh contracts for provisions and forage to be ready by the 20th of May, in Roumania. In February a quantity of shrapnel was directed to be sent to the western fortresses. A service of carrier pigeons had been established to connect the various fortresses and points of strategical importance. For this purpose 400 pigeons were imported from Berlin in January. A letter from Kischinev, published in February, speaks of the train equipment as having been for wrecks massed at the railway station ready to move, and as having with it 24 small pontoons in pieces, and others of a larger scale, and a quantity of naval stores. February intelligence alludes to the extreme efficiency as regards arma ment, &amp;c., of the fortress on the Dniester. Among them Bender is specially mentioned for impregnability, so much so that the Emperor had decorated General Salkov, to whose superintendence its state of strength w r as due. New r s of about the same date mentions the distribution of the siege Artillery in nnmerous parks at Bieltsy and Chotin, and the augmentation of field Artillery by eight batteries of mountain guns; also so continual an increase to the transport material of the train, so as to make it necessary to consider the possibility of its becoming an incumbrance.* Within a period of three weeks an accretion to the train is mentioned of 200 w r agons and 7,400 horses. Vice-Admiral Aikas, commanding the Black Sea fleet, and superintendent of the coast ports, was attached to the Head-quarter Staff, in view, it was believed, of his assuming charge of a flotilla of Russian gunboats, already on the Pruth in a complete state of equipment, which it w r as in contemplation to collect on the Danube at Ismail and Galatz. * This is in direct antagonism with other equally trustworthy accounts, which speak of a deficiency of transport.26 Rb. 1877. March 1877. Jan. 1877. Feb. 1877. A February letter from Odessa gives the armament of that place for coast defence at 88 guns of position, and relates that there had been recently added to the defences of Otchakow some floating batteries, mounting among them 28 guns; and gives the Otchakow garrison at 8,000 men, including marines. At Kischinev and Odessa, contracts were invited in March, and merchants and others requested to submit terms for the delivery of large quantities ot provisions during the month of April, at Jassy and Gmrgevo, and various Roumanian towns between the two points. V. RAILWAYS, ROADS, BRIDGES, &amp;c. Besides the bridges over the Pruth, mentioned in Captain Clarke’s (Deputy-Assistant Quarter-Master-General) paper on “ The steps which Russia would take should she determine to occupy the principalities in the spring, there is a floating bridge described as follows:— It is somewhat above Husch, a place about 35 miles south-east of Jassy. It will bear a cart, or anything of that kind, but nothing more, being ill- constructed. The other bridges over the Pruth alluded to above appear to be three besides the railway bridge at Sculiani. A road bridge at Sculiani, one at Falshi, a few miles below Leovo, and one at W oduly Isakchi, a few miles north of Reni. Below Husch, the Pruth valley is a series of lakes and marshes only traversed by country paths and not easily to be temporarily bridged for military purposes. In Captain Clarke’s paper above referred to occurs the following passage: —“ Should the Russians desire to throw across an additional bridge they would probably select to do so at the point near Hus (or Husch), where the country road down the left bank meets that down the right.” This appears to describe with sufficient accuracy the actual site of the above-mentioned floating bridge. Generally speaking, the Kischinev—Jassy line is badly constructed. A landslip of the bank, near the Korneshti station, such as might easily he brought about by an enemy, would suffice to stop all traffic for a long time. An addition was ordered in January to the Russian railway rolling-stock, of 150 carriages suitable for the transport of sick and wounded soldiers. Intelligence dated the middle of January, was to the effect that the state of the Kischinev—Jassy line, near Korneshti, had been looked to ; and that works had recently been undertaken to strengthen the crumbling embankments and guard against landslips, and it was stated that that part of the line was in good order, though closed to public traffic. On the l7th January confidential instructions were despatched to the managing offices of 54 Russian lines of railway, directing the necessary steps to be taken for being prepared, if required, to suspend all ordinary goods traffic after the 27th January, with a view to the possibility of the lines being then required exclusively for the transport of troops. An extensive order was issued in February by the Russian Government to the railways to add ambulance carriages to their rolling-stock. It was stated to be the intention of the Russians, when moving forward, to advance as much as possible by road and leave the railway lines for the con veyance of the ambulances and “ materiel.” It was reported in February, from Pesth, that 8,000 men (“ military engineers ’’) were employed on the lines in Roumania in assimilating the gauge to that of Russia, by putting down an extra line of rails, and that the work would be completed in three weeks. The Russian gauge is 5 feet, and that of Roumania, 4 ft. 8J in. It was also said that the lines which were for the most part single were about to be doubled. The Russians also had collected at Kischinev a store of 200 tons of axles so constructed as to enable them to utilize some of their own rolling-stock on the existing Roumanian lines.27 In February, all the railway officials in South Russia were put under the 1877 orders of the military authorities. The ordinary goods traffic, however, on the southern railway lines was not interrupted. Intelligence early in the month announced that during the month further transport on the southern lines would be required for 45,000 men. Towards the end of January and beginning of February, a large increase was made to the rolling-stock of the southern lines. The Kiev line alone had received an additional 380 carriages. Some had been purchased and the rest borrowed from other railways. VI. ROUMANIA, SERVIA, &amp;c. The Servian forces in January were estimated at two Army-Corps, each of Jan 1877 32,000 men, with 96 guns; but the whole Servian army was in such confusion that it was doubtful how far these numbers represented an actually disposable force. At the same time it was announced that the Servian Government was making great preparations. The first-class of reserves were called out and were to be stationed at Gladova and Negotin, both of which were fortified, and the works at Deligrad were being increased and strengthened. A line of entrenchments had been thrown up between Deligrad and Kruschewatz and • forts constructed at Parakjin and Kjuprija in the Morava valley. Servia had obtained 100,000 Remington rifles by the aid of Russia. The Russian Volunteers in Servia were broken up. The Russian General Nikitin, who was charged to settle certain questions at issue between them and the Servian Government, decided against the former, and the majority of them left the country to return to Russia, a minority proceeding to form a separate Corps in Roumania. Later intelligence announced that these volunteers received instructions from their own Government to await further orders at Turn-Severin. In the event of a Russian Legion being formed for Servia, General Now r ossoloff, was named as its probable commander. Important negotiations—no details of which, however, have transpired— Feb 1877 were in progress during the month of February, between the Russian and Roumanian Governments respecting the possible passage of the troops of the former through the territory of the latter. It was reported from Galatz at the end of February that the Roumanian troops were about to occupy Barbosi, on the railway near Galatz, to anticipate its possible seizure by the Turks. Earlier in the month (the order is dated 7th) all reserves under arms were directed to be sent home. A project had been discussed for establishing a neutral zone in Roumania, in the event of war breaking out. To discuss this and other questions the Roumanian Government was represented at Kischinev by several superior officers. The Russian Chief of the Staff recognised the impractibility of the neutral zone idea and it was abandoned. VII. THE TURKISH ARMY. There are no accurate data to hand of the strength and distribution of Jau. 1877. the Turkish Army in the month of January, or even such as would enable a tolerably reliable estimate to be formed from balancing the conflicting reports.28 Jaa. 1877. Feb. 1877. Probably, by degrees, official information may come in, but in the mean time there seems no other course open than to put down the most apparently reasonable reports, rejecting what seems exaggerated or improbable. According to one of the former, the total strength of the Turkish forces was 044,512 men. . . „ ^ A « .v 40,000 men were at Nisch on the frontier of Servia, to be ready lor the termination of the armistice. Large contingents had been drawn from Syria, about 60,000 men. The latest January intelligence, sent from Eustchuk, estimated the Turkish forces in Bulgaria at 146,000 men, distributed in 184 battalions of Nizams, 76 of Redifs, and 21,000 Cavalry, with 292 guns. The effective stiength of the battalions of Nizams and Eedifs was given at about 500 men, all told, and this list is'exclusive of irregular troops and reservists who were still arriving. It was calculated that the 1st February would see the Turkish Army concentrated and deployed along the line of the Danube^ from the Sulina mouth and Tultscha to Lorn Palanka, and even beyond Widdin. Some details are given of the Turkish Army as seen in February by an English officer, who described it as armed, the Infantry with Martini-Henrys, Sniders, and muzzle-loaders, and the Cavalry with flint pistols and Remington carbines. In February, the Turks were described as quite unprepared for war, and remarkably blind as to their own deficiencies. A paper force of 370,000 men on the Danube, on which the War Office relied, is reported to mean a real force of barely 8,000 men north of the Balkans, including Saitchar and Widdin, and scarcely a man to the south of them. Intelligence, subsequent to but less reliable than the above, alluded to much moving about and shifting of the troops on the line of the Danube. Schumla and Widdin had received considerable reinforcements, and the force at the latter place was detailed at 57 battalions of Infantry, two regiments of Cavalry and 82 guns, and at the former at 28 battalions, one regiment of Cavalry and eight batteries. The Turks were making great efforts to get their whole army into line by the middle of the month. There was a great scarcity of horses for transport service. The Mustahfiz, or last Militia levy, were also now for the first time being called out, but they were without arms or equipment. Measures, however, were being taken to supply this deficiency. It was also resolved to call out the “ Tcherkesse but only at the last moment—and to employ them against the anticipated Russian advance by the Dobrudscha. Information, dated the middle of February, from Vienna, estimates the Turkish Army at 100,000 men, and 60,000 in the field, but does not explain the distribution in the field, or say anytliing of the condition of the troops. Intelligence from Tuldscha, of the last week in February, relates that the Turkish Commander-in-Chief was prepared to place 20,000 men at that point in 24 hours, on the first sign of a forward Russian movement. Subsequently the following details of the Turkish Army appeared, furnished to the “Journal de St. Petersburg” by its Constantinople correspondent. On the European side, the force was not in excess of 130,000 men, (not counting a small corps in garrison in the provinces of Epirus and Thessaly). This force included 150 battalions of about 600 men, or about 90,000 regular troops, and they are described as admirably armed, equipped, and disciplined, and animated by a true military spirit. (In other words, except as regards numbers the description is the reverse of what has come to hand from reliable sources). The account proceeds with some details of the distribution of this force. The army of the Danube, under the command of Eyub Pacha, is in echelon to the north of the Balkan chain from the Black Sea to the line of the river Timok. It includes the garrisons of Saitschar and Schumla, and absorbs of the above force some 70,000 men, whose formation is complete. There are at Constantinople about 45 battalions, not yet fit to enter the first line, and behind all these the reserve, being assembled and drilled in various unspecified localities in the interior. * * Circassians.i 29 The same correspondent stated that orders had been issued to the Feb - 1877 - direction of the Adrianople railway to prepare for the immediate transport to the interior ot 24 battalions, to be followed in a week by seven others. A Vienna authority, writing in February, declares that all the efforts of the Turks will not enable them to assemble more than 100,000 men in Bulgaria. In March the Turkish strength at Widdin (exclusive of a force of 40,000 March 1877. men it was proposed to concentrate in an entrenched camp there), was given at 71 battalions of Infantry of the line, 12 squadrons of Cavalry, and 12 batteries of Artillery, told off into two divisions. In addition to these there were five battalions distributed between Rustchuk, Palanka and Lorn, to keep up the communications between the different fractions of the force lining the Danube. The total strength of this force was given at 60,000 men. VIII. TURKISH FORTRESSES, STORES, &amp;c. Rustchuk .—Opposite side of the Danube to Giurgevo. About 100 Feb. 1877. yards from the Giurgevo landing place, in the stream of the Danube, is an island about half-a-mile in width, and distant some 700 or 800 yards from the r Turkish side of the river. On it are the remains of two batteries facing south, probably Russian ones of 1854. The island is a mile and a half below the town of Rustchuk, opposite the terminus of the Rustchuk—Varna railway. The enceinte of the Rustchuk fortress is of very ancient date and weak in profile, the relief being about 25 ft. at most. It was out of repair, escarp and counter-scarp crumbling into the ditch in many places. The fortress and forts contained many powder magazines, badly protected and conspicuously placed, in which much powder was stored. The Rustchuk forts were 12 in number, none of them constructed to meet the requirements of rifled Artillery. Hence Rustchuk is described as practically without defence, though affording an unusually good position for an army of 30,000 to 40,000 men. The key of the position is a hill on which a permanent fort, likely to be ready in two or three months, was being constructed. This hill is commanded by another to the south-east, about 600 yards to the west of the Rustchuk—Schumla road, on which it is intended to build another fort. Of existing fortifications at Rustchuk, the a most perfect were a redoubt on the banks of the river, about 300 yards from the enceinte, and 200 to the north of the Rustchuk—Silistria road. It was the intention of the Turks to arm the forts at Rustchuk with 240 guns, but in February no guns were mounted except a few smooth-bores in the enceinte. Of the 240 guns only a limited number were to be rifled (about 42). The Turks had only 11 or 12 rifled guns of position north of Schumla. 54 had recently been landed at Varna, for which place 44 of them were destined, and further cargoes of guns were arriving before the end of the month. There was no certain information as to the force at Rustchuk. It was stated at 9,000 Infantry, and there were contradictory reports about the presence of two field batteries of Artillery. It was allowed that the garrison was very unhealthy, but there were only 120 men in hospital. Turtukai .—An important point on the Danube, between Rustchuk and Silistria, opposite Oltenitza; in itself a dirty little Turkish village, without defences, troops, or telegraph. Silistria .—The nominal garrison in February was 12,000 men, but there Feb. 1877. were only 90 men in the hospital, so the paper force was probably in excess of the real one. There were two field batteries, with light breech-loading brass guns, probably of similar calibre to English nine-pounders, and no cavalry. The fortifications of Silistria were inspected in February by an English officer, from whom a report on the subject may be expected.30 Schumla .—The Turks have recently built one new fort on a hill named Boush-Tepe (five hills), to the north-west of the town. It is well placed, of irregular shape, and is to mount 12 guns. Three lunettes are to be built in front of the fort. There are two other large forts in process of construction, one a star fort to the south-east and the other a German fort to the south. In February, the garrison numbered less than 10,000 Infantry, composed of two brigades, each brigade cpnsisting of two regiments, and each regiment of three battalions. There were also a regiment of Cavalry and some field batteries, the reported numbers varying between four and eight. Of these some had Armstrongs, and muzzle-loaders and breech-loaders were mingled together. There are eight or nine old forts, dating from 1828 and 1829, or from the Crimean war, valuable against field artillery, but useless against heavy ordnance ; all much out of repair, and with no guns mounted except a few old smooth-bores. Schumla from its natural advantages is a very strong position, and is well protected from investment by high hills and impassable forests to the morth- west. The new forts are upwards of a mile in advance of the old ones and crown an admirable defensive position for a large army. News from America in February mentions that Turkey had been engaged since 1870, and was still, in procuring warlike stores, chiefly arms and cartridges. One company, the “ Winchester,’’ at Newhaven, was credited with having already sent a hundred million of cartridges] and cartridge shells to Constantinople. The strength of the Turkish Navy was officially stated in February at 116 ships, of a total burden of 101,102 tons, armed with 759 guns, and was according to Vienna intelligence manned by about 16,000 men. Turkey was also credited (by report) with having 15 monitors on the Danube. As regards what has been said above respecting the Turkish fortresses on the Danube, however incapable they may be of resisting a vigorous attack under modern conditions, it appears established by intelligence received towards the end of February that recently, important works had been in progress to render them efficient, and that therefore the defensive power of the river line is very different from what it was a year ago. In confirmation of what has been said of the supply of arms, &amp;c., obtained from America by the Turks, a consignment of 200,000 Martini-Henry rifles, and 30,000 revolvers was due in February. March 1877. News from Turkey in March described the fortresses of Silistria, Schumla and Varna as in a perfect state of defence, both as regards garrison and armaments, and the Commander-in-Chief was in communication with the forts on the Danube, with a view to filling up as quickly as possible all gaps still existing in the ranks of the garrisons. It was resolved to concentrate 40,000 men in an entrenched camp near Widdin, and at the other extremity of the line of the Danube works were being thrown up for the defence of the plain of the Dobrudscha. T he Krupp guns already mentioned as having arrived at Varna had been distributed among the Danube fortresses. A star fort battery had been erected facing Kalafat. Jan. 1877. IX. MISCELLANEOUS. Nothing is more remarkable than the conflicting nature of the rumour received about the beginning of the year from Bessarabia of the condition o the Russian Army. These varied between the extremes of inefficiency confusion, and disorganization on the one hand, and their opposites on th&lt; other As the month of January wore on opinion seemed to lean toward the latter view, and it was held that though undoubtedly the commencemen o mo nhzation showed many weak points in the system, the energy subse quently put forth m every department had remedied defects; and it was said to b( to the interest of Russia that her army should appear in the eyes of Europe lesi efficient than it really was. There is no doubt that foreigners at Kischinev31 newspaper correspondents and others, found few facilities afforded them for j an . 1877. obtaining information, but the reports of witnesses as to what they actually did see suggest the idea of a really efficient and formidable army. The climate of Bessarabia is unhealthy, and subject to epidemics, and by intelligence dated the middle of January, the sanitary condition of the Russian Army in the provinces was unsatisfactory. About Kischinev, diphtheria had made great havoc. Towards the end of the month there was severe frost about Bucharest, and the freezing over of the Danube was anticipated. The Conference of the Great Powers sitting at Constantinople broke up in the latter days of January. February intelligence mentions the arrival at Odessa of 140 Russian Feb. 1877. families that no longer regarded the Turkish capital as a safe residence. Besides these, numerous Russian residents in other parts of Turkey had returned home. The armistice between Turkey and Servia expired with the month of February, but though no definite peace was signed, diplomatic negotiations were in progress, which for the time averted a renewal of hostilities. It was reported in March that navigation at Odessa was suspended on March 1877 account of the severe frost.32 APRIL 1877. PAGE I. Narrative .. II. Mobilization of the Russian Army III.

During the month of April there were continuous rumours of a forward movement of the Russian troops in Bessarabia towards the Roumanian frontier, but these reports were unaccompanied by the details necessary for identifying the various fractions of the army said to he in motion, nor was there any reliable news of real importance till towards the latter part of the month. The armistice between Turkey and Montenegro extired at midnight of the 12th and 13th April, and was not renewed. On the 23rd of April, official notice was given of the rupture of diplomatic relations between Russia and Turkey. Unofficial intelligence of about the same date mentioned the arrival of the Russian Emperor at Kischinev, and his having reviewed the troops. Also that the roads in Roumania were still impassable, and likely to remain so for some time. This last intelligence is confirmed by trustworthy information from St. Petersburg, dated the 11th, according to which the roads will not be practicable for at least three weeks. Intelligence from Bucharest announces that a Russian General of Engineers, with his staff, had gone to Kalafat to inspect and take charge of the works there. It was stated in the newspapers that the Turks had made all their preparations to anticipate the Russians at the Barbosi railway bridge, over the Sereth, between Galatz and Braila, and to destroy the bridge. This was about the latest news before the outbreak of the war. On the night of the 24th of April, Lord Derby announced to the House of Lords his having received intelligence, an hour or two previously, of the passage across the frontier of 1,700 Russian troops. This news was followed rapidly by that of the formal declaration of war with Turkey by Russia (the declaration being dated 12th-24th April), and of the successful seizure of the Barbosi bridge by the Russian Flying Division, under Lieutenant-General Skobeleff (the same who, in 1876, was appointed Governor of Ferghana, in Central Asia). It appears, that for political reasons, the declaration of war by Russia, and the passage across the frontiers, were advanced at least a fortnight. This may account for subsequent apparent delay in the military operations on the European side, as the preparations were not complete when the troops moved forward. The points at which the Russian troops are stated to have crossed the Pruth are three, at Sculiani, Leovo, and opposite Bolgrad. By the latest April news, two new corps appear upon the scene and take up positions vacated by the active army. These are the 13th and 14th Corps, which, at the end of the month, were heard of respectively at Jitomir and Kischinev. By news of the same date, the number of Russian troops that had crossed the Roumanian frontier was given at from 28,000 to 30,000 men, and these were concentrating about Galatz and Barbosi. Several pieces of artillery had been placed in position, to protect the railway bridge at the latter place.33 The badness of the roads had apparently made it necessary to use the railway for the conveyance of troops—Infantry (as well as for that of stores ana war materials), more than had been originally intended. Ihe disembarkation from the railway of troops destined for such points up the Danube as Kalafat Flamunda, Turnu Margureli, Giurgevo, and Kalarasch, appears to be taking place at Marazesti, whence the high road leads by Fock- bam and Rimmik, and meets the railway again at Buzeo. Army head-quarters, it was ® a id, would be successfully transferred from Sculiani to Buzeo, and from -Kuzeo to Ployesti. According to the lastest April intelligence, the general situation seems to have been as follows:— The Russians were advancing parallel to the Danube, up the river, in two columns. * , ', 0f , adva nce no details were to hand, except, that the advanced guard 1 if 1 y orm f d froops pushed forward from those being concentrated about Galatz and Barbosi) had reached Braila, which point and Galatz, and the Barbosi bridge between them, were held by the 11th Corps of Lieutenant- General Prince Schahovskoi. Ismail and Kilia, on the Russian side of the liuth, south of Bolgrad and north of the Kilia estuary of the Danube, were occupied by the 36th Division, belonging to the 7th Army-Corps. These operations and concentrations on the left were then said to be preparatory to a passage of the Danube at Galatz, and an entrance into the Dobrudscha as so ^ n a § the occupation of other points up the river had been effected. • information from St. Petersburg, names Giurgevo as the pomt at which the main body of the Russian Army will most probably cross the Danube. r j II. MOBILIZATION OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY. Russia was stated to have organised and put on a war footing, during the month of April, nine fresh army-corps, exclusive of the Guard Corps, which latter includes three divisions of Infantry, two of Cavalry, “three brigades of Artillery, and one of Chasseurs.” It is stated that there is a great deficiency of officers in the active army engaged in the operations, and that a similar deficiency exists in the 13th and 14th Corps. r hi. RUSSIAN ARMY DETAILS. Official information from Vienna, received in April and dated 7th March gives the details and distribution of the Southern Army, which it is needless to recapitulate, as it is the same as has already been given in the portions of this chapter for preceding months. The numerical strength, however, is not quite the same, and there are one or two remarks that conflict with former repoits. For instance, it is said not to be decided whether the coast Army of Observation will reinforce the active Army of Operation directly, or whether this reinforcement will be done by a new mobilization of other corps. It was calculated that there would be amply sufficient time for any needful measures of reinforcement during the six weeks which the troops will require for their march to the Danube. The numerical strength is thus given:— Army of Operation.—Four Corps, numbering 144,000 men, 32,800 horses and 432 guns. Army of Observation.—72,000 men, 16,400 horses, and 216 &lt;nins. Total Field Army.—210,000 men, 49,200 horses, 648 guns. To supplement the above information, comes intelligence from St. Peters burg, from a trustworthy source. K April 187734 April 1877. It refers to statements by Prince Gortschakoff, Count Schouvaloff, and the Russian press, estimating the Russian forces ready to march against Turkey at half-a-million of men, to deny these assertions, as exaggerations. The information is based on a close examination of the latest Russian official returns. The statement itself is dated March 16th, and the Russian return referred to, January 12th. The information is as follows :— Troops under immediate command of the Archduke Nicholas, all told .. 210,000 13th and 14th Corps d’Armee (new organisation), stationed at Kiev and Jitomir, all told .. .. .. .. .. • • • • 55,000 Total . 205,000 Deducting non-combatants, there remain— Troops under command of Grand Duke Nicholas .. .. .. .. 185,000 13th and 14th Corps d’Annee .. .. .. .. .. • • • • 50,000 Total 235,000 Deducting from above, Artillery and Engineers, and men of Artillery and Engineer parks, there remain— Troops under Grand Duke Nicholas .. .. .. .. •. • • 150,000 13th and 14th Corps d’Armee .. .. .. .. .. .. • • 40,000 Total 190,000 The Army of the Caucasus (with which this paper is not concerned), with similar deductions made, is given at 40,000 men, raising the foregoing total to 230,000. From this whole strength, 20,000 men are deducted for sick, leaving a force of 210,000 combatants to represent the armies in Europe and the Caucasus, with which Russia is prepared to attack Turkey. The writer infers that the deficit in men has been partially reduced since the date of the despatch, but that, with regard to officers, the position must be much the same as it was. Former information from the same cpiarter alluded to an immense deficit of officers in the Army of Bessarabia; and it only remains to add that, in the 13th and 14th Army-Corps, there are deficient 600 officers. The following information is from the ordinary sources :—Intelligence from Galatz, dated the 20th April, refers to the question of the reinforce ment of the four Corps of the Army of Operation (8, 9, 11, 12), alluded to in the foregoing despatches. According to this authority, these Corps have been reinforced, both by the two Corps of the coast “Army of Observation” (7 and 10), and by the 13th and 14th Army-Corps, mentioned in the statement just given. Is is, however, very doubtful about the 7th and 10th Corps. That the former, stationed at Odessa, has pushed forward detachments to Ismail and Kilia appears to be established, but nothing more. The 13th Corps was still at Jitomir, and the 14th had replaced the troops of the original Army of Operation at Kischinev. Some of the returns from which the details in this chapter were compiled, omitted to state the number of battalions in Russian Infantry regiments, and of brigades in Divisions, which are as follows:— Each of the 48 Divisions of the Russian Army consists of two brigades, and each brigade of two regiments. In 10 of these Divisions (three of the Guard and seven of the Caucasus), the regiments have four battalions, and in the remaining 38 Divisions, three battalions. There are, therefore, altogether, 616 battalions of Regular Infantry in the Russian Army, exclusive of the Rifle Brigades. 1 he composition of Eieutenant-General SkobelofF’s Flying Division of Lclaireurs is detailed in unofficial intelligence as follows:—Lieutenant- Colonel Konkarenko’s Regiment of six sotnias of Kuban Cossacks, the 30thRegiment of Don Cossacks (six sotnias) under Colonel Orlow, Colonel Leviz- April ov-Menar’s Regiment of four sotnias of Terek Cossacks, Colonel Pankratow s Irregular Militia Regiment of four sotnias of Terek Mountaineers, and a Don Cossack battery of Horse Artillery, with mountain guns. IV. MOVEMENTS OF TROOPS, STORES, WAR MATERIAL, &amp;c. Towards the end of the month, it was reported that the Russians—having occupied Braila and Galatz—were actively employed in placing torpedoes in the Danube, opposite those points. Of four Russian gunboats brought hy rail to Galatz, two had been launched. . 2,200 sacks of Russian grain w r ere delivered at Galatz, trom Odessa, on the loth of April. At the end of last month there were rumours, not authenticated, and given without detail, of the withdrawal of troops from Odessa to Poti, for operations on the Asiatic side. At the close of the month the state of the Russian transport was said to be unsatisfactory. There w r as not enough of it, a state of things likely to be felt more as the troops moved on. (This information, from a trustworthy source, is at variance with unofficial news.) V. RAILWAYS, ROADS, BRIDGES, &amp;c. At the end of April heavy inundations near Ungheni were interfering seriously with the Russian transport. Materials were being collected for a floating bridge over the Sereth, near Sherbesti, and 100 flat-bottomed barges had been ordered by the Russian Consul at Galatz. The official intelligence announcing this (dated 17th), added that the Consul required the barges in ten days, but that they would not be ready for thirty. The carrying capability of the Roumanian railway, when the Russians began their advance, was given at about 18 trains a-day. As a preparation for that advance, 900 railway carriages had been collected at various points along the line between Kischinev and Jassy. The telegraph lines between Ungheni and Jassy had been worked by Russian officials for some time previously, and, since the 20th, goods traffic by railway across the Russo-Roumanian frontier had been stopped. On the 23rd, the 3rd Battalion of the Russian Railway Service Brigade reached Jassy. VI. ROUMANIA, SERVIA, &amp;c.

Up to the 5th of May, as far as the general situation was known, there May 1877. was little change since the end of last month. The left wing of the Russian Army rested on, and was strengthening its positions on, the left hank of the Danube from Braila to Galatz and Reni; and this position was prolonged through Ismail and Kilia, as far as the mouth of the river, by a division from the Coast Army, the 36th, from the 7th Army-Corps of which the Head-Quarters were at Odessa. Prince Schahovskoi’s 11th Corps held the positions from Braila to Reni, inclusive of Galatz and Sherbesti and intermediate villages. No further movement other than across the Danube was to be anticipated from this part of the force, which became a pivot round which the rest ot the active army was believed to be wheeling to the left to take up, as quickly as difficulties of bad roads and other obstacles would allow, positions along the north bank of the river. Army head-quarters were to be transferred successively from Jassy to Buzeo and Ploesti, but as yet were not advanced beyond Kischinev. It is difficult to arrive at a correct estimate of the number of Russian troops actually in Roumania, as the figures given vary from 40,000 to 250,000. It is probable that the strength was not less than 60,000 up to the 5th of May, including the troops in position on the Lower Danube and those moving up the river. Hobart Pasha, the Commander-in-Chief of the Turkish Navy, who was on the Danube when the war broke out, successfully ran a blockade down the r- river under the Russian guns, and having joined the fleet was credited (by newspaper report) with the intention of bombarding Odessa. No collision ot much importance had as yet taken place on the Danube between the lurks and the Russians. The above is a general summary of the state of things in Roumania according to such intelligence as was to hand up to the 5th of May. The following detals of this intelligence are, of course, liable to contra diction by later news. The Russian position on the Lower Danube was being made one ot great strength. The various villages were secured by field-works, heavy guns were placed in position in batteries on the hanks of the river and torpedoes sunk in the bed of the stream. Between Galatz and Ismail a camp of 3,000 huts ot wood had been erected by the troops, and six Russian gunboats were being concentrated near the mouth of the Sereth for the protection ot the Barbosi Bridge. A portion of the Black Sea squadron also was expected at the mouth of the Danube. A quantity of bridging material was being collected at Galatz and Sherbesti. . , This was required to bridge the Sereth (over which two additional bridges had been thrown), to repair an already existing, rather u rotten bridge over the Pruth, and to throw over the Dauube a bridge which should strike the right bank at Isaktchi. L38 May 1 s 77 . The Head-Quarters of the 11th Corps were at Galatz, and Prince bchahovskoi, its commander, had issued orders for all merchant shipping at that place and Braila to be clear of those ports by 6 o’clock on the evening of Saturday, the 28th of April. As regards the other flank of the .Russian adv ance, up to the 5th of May there was no authentic intelligence further than that the advanced guard had reached Buzeo (where the road that diverges from the railway at Marazesti rejoins the line), and that Russian troops pro- ceeding by rail were passing round Bucharest bound for Giurgevo.

It would appear proboble that these reports may be all due to the active arrival of Russian troops at Ursicini; as from this latter point a road runs through Slobodzia to Gura Jalonitza, on the Danube opposite Hirsova, while another road diverges from it at Slobodzia and runs south to Kalarasch. The official notification of the blockade of the Russian coast of the Black Sea as far on the European side as the Kilia estuary, is dated Constantinople, May 3rd, the blockade to have effect from the 1st. The last news of any im portance up to the 5th of May is of an engagement taking place on the 4th between a Turkish monitor and the Russian batteries below Reni, which were covering an attempt to throw a bridge across the Danube between that point and Isaktchi. The Turks in evacuating the Dobrudscha and retiring behind a second line were said to be making arrangements to lay waste the country behind them, and to burn Toultcha. In general terms, the Turkish movements, as reported this week, seemed to imply a withdrawal from both flanks, the Dobrudscha and Widdin, and a con centration towards the centre about Rustchuk. The Turks were still said to be 50,000 strong at Widdin, and still in force at Toultcha, but were under orders to evacuate the latter. II. MOBILIZATION OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY. The mobilization is officially announced of the 21st and 38th Infantry Divisions, thus completing the mobilization of the entire regular army of the Caucasus. Reliable intelligence from St. Petersburg, dated the 23rd of April, announces that before leaving Kischinev, the Czar had ordered the following details of mobilization :— 1. The 2nd and 3rd Divisions of Infantry with their Artillery. 2. The 4th Army-Corps ; made up of the 16th and 30th Infantry Divisions with their Artillery, and the 4th Cavalry Division. These were to be ready in three weeks, and were intended to reinforce the European Army of operations. 3. The tfth Artillery Brigade of Parks; destined to supply the Guards, the 1st Army-Corps and the above 4th Army-Corps, and 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions. 4. 10 Reserve Battalions; formed of fortress troops, intended for duties on the line of communications; to be composed of two fortress battalions of Bender, two of Bobruisk, and six of Dunaburg. 5. Twelve batteries of complementary troops. There still remained immobilized in Russia, 21 Infantry Divisions at the date of this news. All the Don Cossack regiments of the 1st and 2nd part were mobilized (40 regiments of Cavalry). Additional field hospitals had been formed. The siege train was in immense strength. Unofficial intelligence announces that the mobilization of the Guards Corps, and the 1st Army-Corps—both of which have their head-quarters at St. Petersburg—had already been decreed. Of 16 newly formed Army-Corps, 11 have two Infantry Divisions and the remaining five have three. The latter five corps are the following:— The Guards, and 1st at St. Petersburg ; the 2nd at Wilna ; the Grenadiers at Lublin ; and the 6th at Warsaw.41 men. The first torpedoes were laid in the river on the night of the 28th of Ma y 1877 - Banjasa is mentioned in early May intelligence as occupied by Russian troops, and it was announced that a large force would he concentrated there. This Banjasa is about three miles north-west of Bucharest, near the point where the two lines of railway converge, from Jassy, and Krajovo; hut there is another town of the same name, also said to have been reached by the Russian troops, on the railway line between Bucharest and Giurgevo. There is an absence of accurate information as to the bridging operations being carried on by the Russians. An immense quantity of bridging material is collected about the mouth of the Pruth, and two bridges are spoken of as in process of construction—one up the river between Turnu and Nikopolis, and one below Reni, to reach the southern shore at Isaktchi. As regards the former, beyond a vague rumour of Russian troops being seen marching west of Giurgevo, there is no confirmatory intelligence of their presence at Turnu. Large working parties of Russian troops were employed in repairing and improving the roads about the position on the Lower Danube. The floods in Roumania, by damaging the railway bridges had brought several trains of troops (15 engines and 200 carriages) to a stand still. The passage of troops this week over the Barbosi bridge is given at five military trains per day. The earliest May intelligence announced that the passage of the Pruth by the Russian Army, about the 24th April (a fortnight earlier than was originally intended), took Prince Charles by surprise. The news of the withdrawal of the Roumanian troops from Jassy was simultaneous with that of the arrival of the Russians there. A proclamation by the Grand Duke Nicholas to the Roumanian people, announcing the passage through Roumanian territory of the Russian Army, is dated the 24th of April. Immediately after the news of the evacuation of Jassy by the Roumanian troops came that of the simular evacuation by them of Kalafat and Galatz, and of the concentration of the troops of the principality about Bucharest. Subsequently the Roumanian troops re-occupied Kalafat, and the Rouma nian Army became the right wing of the Russian active force. It is announced that orders have been given for the moblization of the Roumanian Militia, and that the entire Militia force will be called out. Each district in the province was to contribute a battalion, and the city of Bucharest a battalion. A Roumanian gunboat was stationed off the mouth of the Sereth. Servia continues neutral. April, and the following week they were down along the whole line from Braila to Reni. It was also rumoured that torpedoes had been laid below Reni to the mouth of the river. y.

There is no fresh detailed information this week of the strength, distri bution or movements of the Turkish forces between the Danube and the Balkans. VIII. TURKISH FORTRESSES, STORES, &amp;c. Early May intelligence, alluding to the end of April, announced the pre sence of seven Turkish ironclads in the Sulina mouth of the Danube, preparing to ascend the river. Intelligence from Bucharest of the 3rd of May describes the Turks as very busy in the construction of two large earthworks at Rustchuk. The Turkish ironclad flotilla for service on the Danube is said to include five gunboats carrying in a turret either a smooth-bore 68-pr. or a rifled Armstrong 40-pr.; three low-decked monitors with two turrets; two smaller monitors with one turret and two Armstrong guns; and two other monitors with one gun each. IX. MISCELLANEOUS. The earliest May intelligence reported the roads as in bad order in Roumania. The water in the Pruth and Danube was very high. The marsh lands continued flooded.MAY 7th to MAY 12th. CONTENTS. PAGB I. Narrative .. .. .. .. ..43 II. Mobilization of the Eussian Army .. 45 III. Eussian Army Details .. .. .. 45 IV.

During the week ending on Saturday the 12th May, little has taken place May to throw fresh light on the Russian plans, and nothing to change the general opinion that the Danube would be passed by the bulk of the Russian force about Giurgevo, and also at many other points lower down, about the 4th week in May. To this it now begins to be added, that the Russians will not operate in force to the west of the line connecting Bucharest with Giurgevo, although Russian Cavalry is reported from Rustchuk to have been seen as far west as Rahovo. Head-quarters were still at Kischinev, but w T ere on the point of moving to Ploesti. There had been a considerable exchange of fire on the Danube between the Russian batteries and the Turkish gunboats, and also between the batteries on both sides resulting in some trifling loss to the Russians, slight damage to some of the batteries, and the destruction of a Turkish ironclad corvette, the u Loufti Djelil.” There had been a reciprocal bombardment taking place be tween Widdin and Kalafat, the latter occupied by Roumanian troops, who had considerably strengthened the defences of the place. None of these engage ments—so far as there is as yet any record of them—were of great importance as regards the effect they are likely to have on the issue of the campaign. The following account gives the proceedings, of which news was received during the week, in more detail:— On the 6th, five Turkish monitors opened fire on the Russian batteries on the heights above Braila, from. Potbashi (not marked on the maps, but described as opposite Braila). The Russian batteries did not reply. The Grand Duke Nicholas made a tour of inspection of the Russian posi tions at Reni, Galatz, and Braila on the 6th, and left for Jassy on the evening of the 7th. The Turks, knowing that he was expected, tried to shell the train at Braila by the fire of the five monitors on the river, but did not succeed in doing any damage. The mutual bombardment of Kalafat and Widdin began upon the 7th May, and was continued throughout the 8th and 9th. The injuries inflicted seem to have been slight. At Widdin the casualties are given at two killed and four wounded. There is no reliable information as to the result, but the Roumanian works are said to have sustained much damage, and in the town, the barracks and custom house were-burned and the church injured, and some wooden houses at Widdin were destroyed. On the 7th May, a Turkish monitor engaged a shore battery erected close to the Theraponte Monastery, near Satanovo, opposite Isaktchi, from two o 5 clock in the afternoon till night. The Russians had one man killed and two severely wounded (of the 13th Field Battery), lost three horses, and had a gun dis mounted. The monastery was destroyed. On the morning of the 8 th a Russian siege battery at Braila compelled a Turkish corvette and two monitors to retire. An exchange of musketry fire took place by which the Russians had one soldier wounded. The ironclads were also supported by the fire of the batteries at Khiasett. On the 9th, a heavy fire had been sustained for three hours between the Russian batteries at Braila and the Turkish batteries at Khiasett, and was44 May 1877. renewed on the 10th. The Turkish batteries were supported by two monitors on the river. The town of Braila sustained no injury, but several shells fell into the Russian camp. Besides the artillery fire between Braila and Khiasett a constant exchange of fire was also being kept up between the Russian batteries at Braila and the Turkish gunboats on the river, and on the 11th a large Turkish ironclad corvette, the “ Loufti Djelil,” four guns, commanded by Hassan Bey, trying to emerge from behind the island separating the Old from the New Danube, opposite Braila into the main stream, became engaged with the Russian batteries. A shell from the latter penetrated the engine-room and its explo sion ignited the magazine, resulting in the loss of the corvette with her comple ment, given officially at 219 men. This Old Danube channel, called also the Matschin Canal, afforded shelter to the Turkish monitors, and it was an object \uth the Russians to concentrate the fire from the Braila batteries on the mouth of the channel, so as to prevent the egress of the Turkish vessels. It is also said that the destruction of the “ Loufti Djilil ” was due to carelessness on the part of the Turks, and was not caused by the Russian fire. From several rumours, giving no details, and not actually confirmed, but all pointing in the same direction, it vvas becoming apparent before the end of the week that Russian preparations on the left for passing a portion of their loice across the Danube were in progress. On the morning of the 10th, 300 C ossacks were sent in boats from Khiasett to reconnoitre towards Matschin, and became engaged with a detachment of the Turks. The fight was proceeding at noon, and both sides had suffered some loss, but no further intelligence on the subject had transpired at the end of the week. (Khiasett would appear to be a 1 urkish village either on the island opposite Matschin at the junction with the Danube of the Matschin Canal, or more probably on the main land opposite). On the 10th, an engagement which lasted five hours took place between a Roumanian battery near Oltenitza and a Turkish battery in front of Turtukai, supported by two monitors on the river. The town of Turtukai was set on fire by the shells, one monitor was much damaged and the Turkish fire was silenced. he Roumanian casualties are given at one man killed, an officer and three men wounded, but are probably considerable. i *i T1 m re i IS as £ et r !° record of&gt; a passage of the Danube in any force cither jv he i in ks or Russians, but a Cossack reconnoitring party crossed near Braila as already related, and parties of the former have crossed at different points into 1 Rumania and inflicted some damage on the inhabitants, among other places at Kalarasch, opposite Silistria, where they burned some huts and fired on t ic peasants, and at 1 iketu, opposite Rahovo, where they burned the village and some ships flying the English flag. As there were no Russian troops or at cries at Oltenitza when it was fired upon by the monitors, and no soldier of any nationality at Piketu or opposite Kalarasch when the Turks landed there these proceedings annoyed the Roumanians, had much to do with the complete abandonment of an attitude of neutrality by that province, and are said to have been the cause of the bombardment of Widdin from Kalafat. On the otliei hand, it is also said that the firing at Kalafat was begun by the Turks Li any case, however up to the date of the commencement of the bombard- That ovPnt 0S1 f‘ 10n ° f R °T ania a ? at War with Turke ^ was not stri ctly defined, i hat e\ent, of course, put an end to all doubt. • rn Jrf rd , S 0f the ® nssian ri S ht the first advanced guard of Cossacks reached Ch.tdla near Bucharest, on the railway line between Bucharest and J’loesti on the 6th.

The notifica-MOBILIZATION OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY. It was announced this week that the whole force of the Roumanian Militia Ma . v had been called out, and all three classes enrolled. The three classes are the unmarried men of sufficient age for military service; the married men without families; and the married men with families. III. RUSSIAN ARMY DETAILS. The Roumanian Army, forming the right wing of the Russian Army, consists of four Divisions, organised in two Army-Corps of two Divisions each. One Corps has its head-quarters at Krajovo, with a Division at Kalafat, and is commanded by Major-General Lupu; the other, under General Radovits, is stationed at Bucharest and Giurgevo, The decree announcing these and minor Divisional and Brigade Staff appointments, the assumption of the chief com mand by Prince Charles, and his selection of M. Slaniceaunu to be his Chief of the Staff is dated Bucharest, May 10th. Intelligence from Bucharest of the 8th May gives the strength of the Roumanian force at Kalafat as 20,000 men. A Bulgarian Brigade, of which no details as to strength are given, was stationed at Ploesti, under the command of Colonel Stilletoff, with Russian officers. It was also stated that the Bulgarian residents of Jassy were organising a Corps to serve as the nucleus of a legion of 10 battalions to be raised in Bulgaria to assist the Russians. The Roumanian Horse Artillery is armed with Krupp guns, and is described as well-horsed and perfectly equipped, and the men as of good physique. The Roumanian troops at Bucharest were reviewed by Prince Charles on the 7th. Their numbers on the ground are given at 5,500 men, consisting of two squadrons of Cavalry, 8 four-gun (Krupp) batteries of field artillery, and five battalions of Infantry. They w r ere about to march to Oltenitza. The strength of the Roumanian Army is given in round numbers at about 60,000 men.

The latest intelligence of the week announces that the Russians are establishing batteries at Giurgevo, hut it is possible that this was being done by the Roumanian troops. In any case it was telegraphed from Rustchuk on the 10th that batteries were being constructed to command the forts and town of Rustchuk and the station of the Varna railway. The march of Russian troops round the town of Bucharest in the direction of Giurgevo was proceeding steadily. The passage that day of a Cavalry Brigade of two regiments and a battery of Artillery is mentioned in news from Bucharest of the 11th. On the same day two Roumanian batteries left Bucharest, one going west and the other in u an opposite diiection, probably towards Giurgevo. . ^ _ It was stated before the end of the week that there were 10,000 Russians at Giurgevo, and that they were moving westward up the Danube towards Simnitza, opposite Sistova, and Turnu-Margureli, opposite Nikopolis (at the confluence with the Danube of the Aluta river that forms the frontier of little Wallachia), and Russian Cavalry are again said to have been seen still further west opposite Rahovo. . Later intelligence seems to confirm this information. As, however, Giurgevo is the head-quarters of a Roumanian Division it is probable that up to the end of the week the force there was mainly Roumanian, and that the Russian force was concentrated at Banjassa, between Bucharest and Giurgevo. The Emperor of Russia has made a present to Prince Charles of Roumania of 2,000 horses and 36,000 rifles. # Russian officers are reported as having arrived at Tumu-beverm. Intelligence from Bucharest, dated the 9th of May, mentions the encamp ment, at the time of writing, of a large Russian force in the neighbourhood, at Banjassa (not the same as 'the place above mentioned). Amid the conflicting intelligence respecting the strength of the Russian armies of operation, it is desirable to note such accurate information received from time to time, as may serve for a fresh point of departure in making the calculations necessary to estimate the correctness of the different reports. I rustworthy information from Odessa received this week, sent during the early part of last month, estimates the total strength at that time of the six Corps of the active and coast armies at not more than 270,000 men. Out of this number, 70,000 were absorbed by the two Corps then on the coast and in the Crimea. Three Russian gunboats left the Pruth on the 10th for Braila. With reference to this statement it is possible that these boats may be three out of some eight or more stated on reliable intelligence to have been seen at Kischincv in April, loaded on railway wagons, and described as about48 May 1877. 30 feet long, of eight nominal horse-power, weighing 3^ tons, built, one of steel, the rest of iron, and supposed to be for torpedo service. The Russian Government had recently entered into a contract with a firm at St. Petersburg for torpedo boats for the Black Sea, of which two were expected to be ready about the middle of June. They had also purchased from the same firm a small steam launch and sent it to the Danube. The arrival of Russian Artillery, conveyed in 100 railway wagons at Bucharest on the 10th May is announced. Intelligence from Rustchuk of the middle of the week relates that quan tities of Russian stores were being sent towards Kalafat; and from Widdin it is telegraphed that war material has been sent by rail to Turnu-Severin. A large Russian force was being concentrated at Banjassa, on the railwav line between Bucharest and Giurgevo, and generally it appeared to be part of the ussian plan to keep these troops and all others on their left, withdrawn from the banks of the river. On the 6th, eleven trains of Russian troops, with tents and stores arrived at Bucharest. The troops all passed on towards Banjassa, on the Giurgevo hne and on the 7th, it was computed that 12,000 troops had so passed Bucharest. 1 Two Russian Generals (Katalei and Stolzenwald) are named as having- arrived in Bucharest on the 7 th. Y. RAILWAYS, ROADS, BRIDGES, &amp;c. Up to the end of the week there still continues the same absence of positive information as to the positions of the Russian bridges for passing the Danube, except as regards three—one at Isaktcha, one at Galatz, and one at raila. There is a report of a pontoon bridge constructed near the mouth of le Sereth, and ready to be towed into the Danube by steamer, and placed at once wherever it may be required. The Russians were elaborate in their arrangements for the protection of the railway m Eoumama, Cossacks patrol it night and dav, and there are pickets at every bridge. May Tlie R ° Umanian railwa J was re-opened for goods traffic on the 9th of daiL e gteld a dge i s njUredthe ^ ^ causing landslips and r, , f* 16 tra ffic had been temporarily interrupted from this cause between Bucharest and Krajovo, and on the line between Galatz and Jassy, at the bridge over the Sereth, near Tecuci, by the rising of the river. B VI. ROD MANIA, SERVIA, &amp;c. Prince Charles of Roumania undertook a tour of inspection of th, Roumanian troops and positions, and was at Giurgevo on the 10th A clausi m a convention between Roumania and Russia prescribes that the town o Bucharest is not to be occupied by Russian troops. Hence the latter in their marches towards Giurgevo have to make a circuit round the town Accounts from Servia are conflicting, and the neutrality of the province i« ess assured than it was by the news of last week. Intelligence from Vienna of the 0th May announces warlike preparations. The Artillery had received orders to be ready to march to the frontier within a month ; a general mobili to dm g P th6 MiHtia ° f th6 P ° Sarevat2 ^t was oTdered49 VII. THE TURKISH ARMY. The latest intelligence received this week gives the following information Ma y 18 ' 7 - of the strength and distribution of the Turkish Army in Europe. I he Army of the Danube included 189 battalions (103 of nizams and 86 of redifs), 54 squadrons of Cavalry and 108 field-guns. These were distributed as follows :— At Widdin, 72 battalions, 18 squadrons and 102 guns ; Lorn, 2 battalions; Rahovo, 2 battalions ; Nikopolis, 3 battalions ; bistova, 3 battalions ; 1 urtukai, 3 battalions ; Rustchuk, 16 battalions, 12 squadrons, 18 guns ; Silistria, 22 bat talions, 12 guns; Tultscha, 3 battalions; Tsaktchi, 3 battalions; Matschin, 2 battalions; Medschidil, 2 battalions; Czernavoda, 2 battalions; Babadagh, 2 battalions ; in the Dobrudscha, 4,000 Tcherkesses. There were besides, at Kustendje, 1 battalion ; Varna, 16 battalions and 54 guns; Schumla, 13 battalions, 6 squadrons, and 78 guns; Tirnova and Ras- grad, 3 battalions; Sophia, 14 battalions, 6 squadrons, and 6 guns, the rediis were stationed almost exclusively at Widdin and Sophia. Besides the above there were also in other parts of Europe, as lolloivs .— Herzegovina, 49 battalions and 27 guns; Bosnia, 41 battalions, 6 squadrons, and 42 guns; Albania, 38 battalions and 30 guns; Epirus and Thessaly, l-&gt; battalions, 7 squadrons and 18 guns; and Crete, 14 battalions and 24 guns. Exclusive of small detachments composed chiefly of Moustahfiz, employee! in guarding the passes of the Balkans, and the batteries on the coast, and doing garrison duty at Constantinople, the total strength of the 1 urkish Army f in Europe is given at 348 battalions, 67 squadrons, and 440 guns. The Turkish head-quarters were at Schumla in the middle of the week. Sickness and considerable mortality is reported in the Turkish force at Rustchuk, the deaths within a fortnight during the latter part ot the preceding month are given at 853 men. VIII. TURKISH FORTRESSES, STORES, GUNS, &amp;c. Intelligence, dated the 11th, says that the works for the defence of Con stantinople are to be constructed by the inhabitants of the city. Tins is ie only allusion to these works contained in the news received during the week It is related of the Turkish stores that none of the shells that fell into the town of Braila during the firing of the 4th exploded. Of those used at the bombardment of the Russian position at Rem two G P Of those used at the bombardment of Kalafat during the first day’s firing but one exploded, and, generally, the Turkish shells appear to be unreliable. The following details are given of the Turkish flotilla on the Danube . The vessels are grouped in six categories— 1. Five iron-clad gunboats, carrying each two Armstrong guns, and a bronze gun of small• calibre, with a complement of 3&lt; men. ^se are t e “ Fethi-Islam,” “ Boujan-Delin, ,, “ Semendna,” “ Podgontza, and bchkoura.

These are the “ Schemscheka ” and * Jedynm. 4 Six transports, carrying each two guns, and a complement ot lo men.50 Mav 1877. 5. A despatch vessel carrying 4 guns, with a complement of 28 men the Arcadion ** 6. Two iron-clad corvettes, the “ Hifzil-Rahman,” and “ Loufti-Djelil,” stationed at Sulina.” By this week’s news the latter was destroyed in action at Brai At the date of the declaration of war, this flotilla was reinforced by two corvettes, the “ Feti-Bulend,” and the “ Assiri-Schefkei,” and two gunboats under Vice-Admiral Moustaffa Pacha. This brings its strength up to 24 vessels. With the exception of the “Fethi-Bulend ” (ironclad corvette, 5 guns, 180 men); and the 44 Assiri-Schefkei ” (probably the 44 Assar-Shefket), iron-clad corvette, 5 guns, 170 men; the 44 Podgoritsa,” “Varna,” “Sulina,” “Hifzil-Rahman” (probably the 44 H^zil-Rahmin” iron-clad corvette, 4 guns, 219 men); and the “Loufti-Dielil” (ironclad corvette, 4 guns, 219 men); all the above vessels appear to be in addition to the sea-going Turkish fleet in the Mediterranean. Inclusive of the above-mentioned flotilla, but inclusive of the individual vessels last enumerated, the Turkish fleet in the Mediterranean is given at six iron-clad frigates, 9 iron-clad corvettes, 2 monitors, 1 iron-clad gunboat (the 44 Podgoritsa ”), 3 unarmoured frigates, 8 unarmoured corvettes, 10 un armoured gunboats, 2 paddle steamers, 3 transports, 1 despatch vessel, and 1 yacht. IX. MISCELLANEOUS. In the middle of the week the rivers were still flooded, and much rain was falling, but towards the end of the week an improvement in the weather and in the state of the roads and a diminution of the floods was announced. r51 MAY 13th to MAY 19th.

Up to the end of the week the movements of the Russians on the Danube ^ a y \s77. were Still unrevealed. Of the presence of a large force at Banjassa and other points between Bucharest and Giurgevo there was little doubt, and also that bodies of troops were being brought up on its left so as to connect it with the force at Braila, and that these portions of the army were not on the banks ot the Danube, but thrown back from it and in a kind of echelon, the positions selected being the cross roads where the roads of the interior were intersected by others leading down to the river. On the other hand, to the west of Giuro-evo, between that point and Turnu, at the mouth of the Aluta, and further west still, as far as Rahovo, it appeared to be part of the Russian plan to make a display of troops close to* the river. Later in the week it was becoming doubtful whether this was a ieint or whether there was really the intention of concentrating any large Russian force to the right of Giurgevo, the news being rather in favour of the latter view, as besides the Cavalry near the Danube there were rumours of a strong column kept back from the river, and said to be destined for Turnu Margurele and Simnitza. In the meantime, the Roumanian troops were interlaced with those of Russia, the former holding temporarily the positions from Oltemtza^ to Giuro evo with a strong force of Russian Cavalry and Horse Artillery on their right' between Giurgevo and Turnu Margur61e and towards Rahovo, and the Roumanians coming in again on their right at Kalafat. Tow ards the end of the week it w r as becoming clear that a Russian Corps was taking up its position on the right of that already concentrated about the Bucharest—Giurgevo line, and that the Roumanians were being withdrawn to the extreme right. a # ™ a- j The head-quarters of the Army moved from Kischmev to Ploesti, ana were about to move to Bucharest, but at the last moment this arrangement was postponed on account of the expected arrival of the Emperor ot Russia at Army head-quarters, and the Grand Duke remained at Ploestn The rumours of a Russian movement towards the valley of the limok were becoming more pronounced, but there is no detailed or authentic intelli gence to hand on the subject. „ • n r At the beginning of the week there were rumours of a Russian Corps ot Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery being engaged in the Dobrudscha with the Turks. This intelligence was not confirmed up to the end ot the week. The nucleus of fact at the bottom of it would appear to have some connection with the Cossack reconnaissance recorded last week from Galatz to Khiasett, which was supposed to denote an intention on the part of the Russians (and ot which there is some further information this week) to make an attempt upon Matschin. Potbashi mentioned in the account of this reconnaissance turns out to be the name of an old channel of the Danube. Khiasett is a small fishing villao-e on the banks of the river opposite Braila, in front of and a kind of out- post^of Matschin. It is also called Potbashi by the Turks. By the end of the week it appeared to be established that the village ot Khiasett was in the hands of the Russians, who were entrenching it and were about to erect batteries there.52 May 1877. The probable relative positions of the various invading corps are given in the chapter on the details of the Russian Army. In addition to what has been already said of the probability of the passage of the Danube being made by the main Russian body about Giurgevo, it now begins to be implied that two corps will march by the Dobrudscha. This statement appears to have reference to the llth Corps—which has already established a footing in the Dobrudscha, and the 8th whose objective point on the river would appear to be Hirsova.* The firing on the Danube between the batteries on both sides and the gunboats continued this week. The Russians had mounted heavy guns in their works at Braila, and were said to be trying their range in the direction of Matschin. The duel between Widdin and Kalafat was also continued, and that between Turtukai and Oltenitza was resumed, and a new one is heard of between hfikopolis and Islacs. The events of the week are unimportant, and are given in detail as follows:— Two men were picked up by Russian boats from the wreck of the Turkish corvette blown up off Braila on the llth, both were severely injured, and one is since dead. The stern of the vessel, with the mizen mast and Turkish flag w^ere still above water. The flag was sent to St. Petersburg by the Russians. The Turks themselves report that the explosion was caused by carelessness in loading shells in the magazine. The Russians, on the other hand, are very circumstantial in their account of the occurrence, and the officer who pointed the gun for the shot they affirm w r as the cause of the catastrophe, has been decorated.! On the 13th, the Grand Duke Nikolas and head-quarters left Kischinev for Ploesti, the rest of the Staff were to follow in about six days. On the 13th a slight affair of musketry and artillery, without im portant results, took place between the Roumanian troops and batteries at Oltenitza and the Turkish batteries at Turkutai, supporting an ironclad on the river. There were some casualties at Oltenitza, how many is not stated. The same day a Turkish gunboat was captured by a Roumanian battery below Kalafat. She was unarmed, being on her way to Rustchuk to take in her armament. She passed Kalafat safely under cover of the Turkish fire from Widdin, but was stopped by the fire of the second battery (the Commander of which had been warned about her by telegraph from Kalafat) and surrendered. The Turks at Widdin had two men killed and four w ounded by the Kalafat guns in this affair of the gunboat. The second battery would appear to have been at or near Tschupertscheni. On the 14th, Prince Charles of Roumania visited the Grand Duke Com manding the Russian Army at Ploesti, and on the 15th the Grand Duke arrived at Bucharest to return the visit, going back the same day to Ploesti. The regular transfer of the Russian head-quarters to Bucharest was to take place on the 19th, the Grand Duke taking up his abode at Cotroceni, a suburban residence of Prince Charles.} The same day the advanced guard of the Russian right reached Balsu, near the railway, where the road connecting felatma with Krajovo is intersected by one leading down the valley of the Aluta to the Danube and striking the latter river at Celci, about half way between lurnu Margurele and Rahovo. On the 14th a Turkish gunboat shelled a Roumanian outpost in the Jalomtza district at Cetatina, between Silistria and Hirsova, and burnt part of the village. The Roumanians had one man killed. On the 14th, the Russian advanced guard reached Oltenitza, relieving in that position the Roumanian troops, who withdrew towards the Aluta. On the 14th, a Turkish force embarked in six vessels, tried to cross the Danube m the direction of the Island of Mocan, near Giur^evo. The Roumanian outposts, reinforced from Giurgevo succeeded, after an engagement of musketry, which lasted a considerable time, in driving back the Turks.8 Ori the 14th and loth of May, a Russian detachment from the llth Corps at Braila succeeded in crossing the arms of the Danube opposite that town * Since this was written, the 8th Corps is alluded to in official marching- on Giurgevo. f Sub-Lieutenant Romanofsky. 1 this tiansferof head-quarters was subsequently postponed. ^ Not confirmed by subsequent news * despatches from Bucharest as53 under a fire from the Turkish monitors, and in securing such positions on the May 187 other side for batteries and entrenchments as would enable them to command with their fire the arm of the river that runs under the walls of Matschin. Their works apparently are intended to include a battery at Khiasett, on the right bank, and one at the fork of the river, on the island between the old and new Danube Channel. No details are given of the engagements which resulted in this success. They seem to have lasted two days and to have given rise to the report, else where noticed, of a Russian Corps having landed in the Dohrudscha. A result of the movement appears to be that the Turkish gunboats in the Matschin arm of the Danube are shut up there. On the 15th, the exchange of “ artillery and musketry ’ fire between Oltenitza and Turtukai w r as resumed, was continued from seven to nine in the evening, and was renewed on the 16th. # i m i On the 15th, an affair took place between the Roumanians and lurks at Karagatz, described as near Rustchuk, in which the former were put to mg t with the loss of a quantity of arms and stores, and 20 men killed and wounded. On the afternoon of the 15th, an exchange of artillery fire took place be tween Turkish ironclads on the river and the batteries at Braila that the Russians have most recently armed with heavy guns. When it had been going on for three hours, the Russians ceased firing, as no result was being produced either side. . On the 15th, the Russians threw up entrenchments on the Matschin arm of the Danube without loss, under a fire from the Turkish gunboats confined in that branch of the river. . . , On the 16th, the engagement between the Turks and Russians respectively at Turkutai and Oltenitza was resumed both with musketry and artillery, and continued on the 17th without any considerable damage being reported on either side. It was remarked, as a new feature in the Turkish firing, that their shells generally exploded. . , . i • On the 16th, a Turkish ironclad opened fire on the Russian boats lying near Khiasett without doing any damage. The Russians did not reply to this fire . • On the 17th, an exchange of fire commenced between the Turkish batteries at Nikopolis and the Roumanian batteries near Islacs. „ , The same night a Turkish detachment got across the Danube and killed four Roumanian soldiers on picket duty, returning to their own side of the river afterwards. , /vu *i. a Towards the end of the week, the exchange of fire between Oltenitza and Turtukai seems to have slackened. The breadth of the river here is given a 800 yards. The firing had been carried on by the Turks with a seven-gun battery of old 12-pounders ; and by the Roumanians with field batteries of 6-pounders ; also by musketry on both sides. . The losses at Kalafat of the Roumanians—who appear anxious to conceal the extent of their casualties—is given up to the end of the week at 80 killed and wounded, another account says 110. Their losses at Oltemtza also are said to have been considerable, but are not detailed. ^ . . The Turks have been censured by military critics for not anticipating the Russians at the Barbosi Bridge at the commencement of the campaign ; . and also for not occupying Kalafat, which commands Middin, and defending it so as to prevent its seizure by the Russians and to be able to use it themselves for a tete cle pant. ... ,, It would seem, however, that political considerations were the cause ot these omissions. . . „ . , .i On the other hand, whatever chance they had of securing, by tne.e omissions, the neutrality of Roumania was nullified by their attacks on defence less and unoccupied Roumanian villages, which provoked the province to declare war. * Not confirmed by subsequent intelligence.54 in.

IV. MOVEMENT OF TROOPS, STORES, &amp;c. This week there is mention of Russian gunboats on the Danube, torpedo- boats, and floating batteries put together on the Pruth, carrying ffun, and manned by the marine detachments attached to the active army for river operations ; but there is an absence of detailed information respecting these VeSSe it is stated that shells fired from 8-inch guns in position at Braila have reached the town of Matschin, the distance between the two pomts being giv at 5h miles. The fact probably is that the shells were bred from Russian batteries at Khiasett, on the right bank of the Danube, or from the island separating the Matschin Canal from the New Danube channel. It is said that the Russians have batteries at the latter point, and their seizure Khiasett, and their construction of batteries there appear also established. Braila is more probably seven miles from Matschm Krupp guns have been mounted at Vaduel Budar, above Braila, to com mand the gunboats on the river. nr- The 4th, 13th and 14th Corps are now spoken of as forming the seco line of the active army, hut no detailed intelligence is to hand as to where they are, except as regards the 13th Corps, stated in intelligence rom assy i the 13th of May, to be on the Pruth. ; , The works at Kalafat, being strengthened by the Roumanians, arc situa e on a hill about 2,700 yards from Widdin (with the Danube intervening), on higher ground than and commanding the Turkish fortress. Ike Roumanians were unceasingly engaged in strengthening their works, and had got 40 0 un. into nosition in the batteries bearing upon Widdm. ,, . They have also constructed batteries at Tschetati, further up the river on the road leading from Kalafat towards Turnu-Severin.

The troops and police are very well armed. 22nd March a steamer arrived with a cargo of shot and shell at Constantinople. 4th April a steamer arrived with 7,000 American revolvers, which carry the same cartridges as the Winchester rifle. These are supposed to have been made for the Russians, but, there being some difficulty about payment, the Turks got them at 60 francs each. On the 17th April 1877, it was Danube flotilla, consisting of 17 vessels, defend important points as follows:— Two armour-plated corvettes .. (6 guns and 1,771 tons each). Two armoured monitors (6 guns each and 513 tons). Five armoured monitors (2 guns each and 408 tons). Four small wooden gunboats .. (4 guns each and 300 tons).

The rest to cruise on the river, and anchor between Rustchuk, Silistria, and Turtukai. The corvettes are merely cruisers, and cannot mount the river. The big gunboats do not go higher up the river than Braila, between which and the sea the channel might be guarded. . . The transports are believed to be indifferent vessels, and the remaining gunboats are reported to be slow, and unable to steam against the curren a more than two miles an hour. ,i The Turkish gunboats on the Danube seem to have been active, as the Turks claim to have already captured over 200 Russian vessels laden with 130 000 hectolitres of wheat (about 358.000 English bushels). ’ Early in May the fortifications about Silistria were nearly complete, with, however, about 5,000 men still engaged in the erection of new works.

The party came into collision with the Turks and had to retire with a loss of two men killed and two wounded.

As yet its total strength does not exceed 5,000 foot and 600 horse. All its officers are Russian. III. RUSSIAN ARMY DETAILS. The positions of a part of the Russian force on the Bucharest-Giurgevo linp on the 17th of May are thus described :— , . J ^ , A Division of Infantry and a Brigade of Cavalry close to Bucharest, on the heio-hts skirting the little river Sahara, extending from Jilaya, through Vidra to Dobreni; the left near Gradiste and Gastmara, on the River Argis , which joins the Danube at Oltenitza. The left was m contact with another division posted on the heights above Oltenitza, vacated by the Roumanians. Another Russian Division was on the heights behind Giurgevo, about 20 kdometre^from Frateschta-e Qf j nfantry amo unted to Divisions. Of the places enumerated above the following are stations on the line of railway between Giurgevo and Bucharest, Fratesti, Gradiste, Vidia, an Jflava. returns already given showing the Staff, &amp;c., of the different Russian Army-Corps, certain errors in the returns, or subsequent63 Colonel DochtourofF, of the Russian Staff, formerly Chief of the Staff to General Tchernayef, in Servia, is attached to the Roumanian head-quarters. There are rumours this week that the Circassian element in General Skobeleff’s force has proved untrustworthy. These are so far confirmed that bodies of Circassian troops have been sent back by train to Russia. IV. MOVEMENT OF TROOPS, STORES, WAR MATERIAL, &amp;c. The Russian force concentrated in the positions about Islacs and Turnu Margureli is given in this week’s news at 60,000 men, probably belonging to the 9th Corps. The troops were actively engaged in erecting batteries and strengthening the works of Turnu. A small Roumanian ironclad of four guns, manned by Russian sailors, was launched at Galatz on the 20th. The departure from Kischinev for Ploesti is announced of two battalions of the Bulgarian Legion, respecting the organization of which some particulars are given in the Section on Army Details. The Circassian element in the Russian Army does not appear to have turned out a success. The men were being sent back to Russia. Two trains full of them passed through Barbosi on the 24th, bound for Galatz. A trustworthy authority, writing from Bucharest on the 24th, relates that the Russians have numbers of boats and pontoons at Braila, Galatz, and Reni, and can get others at Oltenitza and Turnu, though the Turks have taken many. Quantities of timber (for bridging) are en route by rail from Galicia to the Danube. A depot of stores was being formed at Jassy. The Roumanian Divisions relieved by the Russian troops in the positions about Oltenitza, reached Bucharest on the 22nd. Intelligence from Warsaw announces the despatch of the 13th Cavalry Division from the Galician frontier to join the Army of the Danube. It consists of the full complement of four regiments of Cavalry—viz., one of Lancers, one of Hussars, one of Dragoons, and one of Cossacks, each numbering 600 sabres ; altogether 2,400 men and horses. As regards the probable localities of the various Russian Army-Corps given in last week’s account, trustworthy intelligence from Bucharest, dated 20th May, alludes to the 8th Corps as on the march to Giurgevo. The Russians are stated in this week’s intelligence to have collected a quantity of bridging material, boats and small steamers on the part of the Danube between Rahovo and Nikopolis. The arrival at Oltenitza on the 21st of a strong force of Russian Infantry, three batteries of Artillery and some Cavalry is reported from Turtukai.
