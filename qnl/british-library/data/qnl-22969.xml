A pay bill may be presented at a district treasury two days before the last working day of the month by the labour of which the pay is earned ; but see rule 217. 2. A pay bill may, if desired, be enfaced for payment to a Banker or Agent and submitted for collection through such Banker or Agent; this will obviate the necessity of the Government servant’s attendance in person or by messenger, as payment may then be made direct to the Banker or Agent. 3. The period for which a subscription to a Fund is due should be specified when it differs from the period for which pay is drawn. \ 4. In the case of Government servants entitled to Sterling Overseas Pay, fund deductions are based on the Rupee Pay plus the rupee equivalent of the Sterling Overseas Pay. Note 1. — Treasury Officers should see that all compulsory deductions including those for Indian Civil Service Provident Fund are duly made and that the schedule^ showing particulars of Fund deductions, are attached to the pay bills.
