Kobe by the s.s.Nankawa Maru for Bahrain on the 24th April, which steamer may be expected here at the end of May, or early in June. ? A stipulation of the Contract of Sale was that no rice should be sold to any other merchant in Bahrain; and the purchase of so large a quantity seems to have been undertaken by this firm with the intention of disposal of it on the mainland of Arabia via the port of Qatif, where this firm has a branch office. ^ It seems likely that when this steamer arrives here The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Ltd will apply to The G-overmnent of Bahrain for permission to act as Agents, to land the cargo which will be re-exported in due course. 4 I understand that The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Ltd., are the Sub-agents of Messrs Frank Strick (Busreh) Ltd, and probably this firm will be the Agents in the Persian Gulf for this steamer; but it is not clear as to which Company owns this steamer, or under what charter rhe is working. c The GovernmentJ of Bahrain has granted a License to The VTesopotamia Persia Corporation to act as Landing Agents for the cargo 5 X steamers of The Strick Line, which license requires them to charge Landing Charges according to a fixed schedule; but it may be considered without any doubt that the landing of cargo ex the above steamer, which is not owned by the Strick Line would not come under this schedule; and consequently the rate of Ps:12-6-0 per 100 bags of rice of 166 lbs each vould not apply, and the Agents would be at liberty to charge a higher :ate, especially as the bags are heavier. i I am also informed that one MiUiiimKi&amp;CL.MarZUk of Karachi has ;ontracted with the same Company for the delivery by the steamer of ;he second shipment, One thousand tons of similar rice at the port of iatif. Messrs Haridas Janimal claim that the steamer should be inhi- )ited from calling at Qatif if it calls at Bahrain, for they claim that latif is a port dependent upon Bahrain, and consequently all Qatif cargo lust pass through Bahrain. This view has been put before the Japan Cottor lompany at Karachi. '. Therefore Mr Karko Bunya a sks if he may be_ jasxiaiktM to lay iis views before you in the hope of obtaining your support to ( 1 ) his irm’s attitude towards the proposed shipment to Qatif, and (2) to nsure that the Landing Charges in Bahrain shall not be increased eyond Rs: 12 - 6-0 per cent.

In the cuse of Dr* 31 egvad these difficulties were met by a frank explanation of tne position, together with the giving to him of a chart showing the banks. Dr. Blegvad wes a straightforward individual and in no way interested in pearls. The Japanese, however, are inveterate poachers, with little or no respect for other people's rights, and the danger of the 'Snimkyo liaru ' 1 indulging in secret pearling, (in addition to what I nave no doubt is their main object i.e. deep- sea fishing observations), cannot be disregarded. 6 . I suggest that an opportunity might be ta&amp;en of informing tne Japanese Government that the 'Sninkyo aaru' should not inter fere with the Arab pearl banks and to this end a chart of the pearl banks might be given to its Captain.

Dear Davies, Ref. the attached. Our Far Eastern section tackled the Naval Intelligence Department at the Admiralty about this and the gist of their reply is as follows. According to r their files the SHINKYO MARU recently carried on the following cruise: 7th Mar.1957 . Left Calcutta, coasted along east coast India, round Ceylon and up west coast. She is thought to have been off Karachi early in April (before 12th). She was at sea 45 days without calling at any port. 22nd Apr.1957 . Arrived Colombo. 29th Apr.1957 (approx. ) Left for Rangoon, Singapore and Japan. During the period 7th March - 22nd April this vessel may have ’’proceeded to v/aters near Arabia and Persia to make a further survey”. The information regarding the proposed survey was in the H.Kf S.I.R. dated 14th April and the origin of the report must have been considerably earlier, so that it is suggested that the above programme fits and the survey, such as it is, has in fact taken place . I understand someone from the India Office rang up N.I.D. this morning about this and they will probably get the above reply. ^ Davies, D. S. 0. ,M. C. , India Office. Yours, (Sd. ) J.

We should be grateful if you could ascertain from the War Office whether subsequent Intelligence Reports contain any further information on this point.

Fowle is greatly concerned about this matter and he is most anxious that every effort should be made to prevent Japanese interference with the Arab pearling banks. He is ready to believe that the 'Shinkyo Maru lf is pursuing a quite legitimate object in surveying the world’s deep-sea fisheries, but he fears that the captain might for his own benefit start pearling in addition to his legitimate activities, and that the Japanese Government might, to save their face, feel obliged to defend his action on the ground that we had given them no previous warning. He is afraid that once the trawlers are in the Gulf it will be too late to make effective representations, and, in the light of the latest information about the ’’Shinkyo Maru” he is strongly of opinion that we should no longer delay an a proach to the Japanese Government Brenan, Esq., O.3.E. , Foreign Office, on/© V 1 &gt;\ 2 , on the /ines suggested in paragraph 6 of his Express Letter No.545-3 of l6th July addressed to the Government of Indiav 3. v7e are impressed wi th Pow 1 e * s vie ws (which, incidentally, are similar to those expressed,, in Admiralty 3ssed in letter No.M. 04446/37 of the 23rd September), and i/e shall therefore be glad if the Foreign Office would consider v whether, unless the Embassy can say that they are completely satisfied, in the light of the information called for in Foreign Office despatch No.476 of the 1st October, tha-y^/^ there is no prospect that the Japanese trawlers may visit the Persian Gulf, it might be feasible to instruct Sir Robert Craigie by telegram to inform the Japanese Government, in a friendly way, that if any time Japanese trawlers are sent to the Persian Gulf, they should not attempt to fish in the territorial waters of the Arab Sheikhs, or to operate on the recognised ^rab pearling banks in the Gulf, without the permission of the Rulers concerned (which must be sought through His Majesty's Government). 4 * Fowle does not think that it is necessary to obtain the concurrence of the Rulers concerned before the Japanese Government are approached; the Rulers would certainly/LO, 3 . cGrt;iinly concur, but to approach them would tahe time. Nor doc?* consider that we should go out of our way to supply charts unless these are called for as a result of the suggested representations to the Japanese Government. 7e agree with these views.

Landings after dark even at Manamah will be prohibited. 2. One sloop is remaining here and officer will call on Sata immediately on arrival to arrange formal calls. I have asked Senior Naval Officer to instruct officer that if he sees aeroplane on deck he should warn Japanese Captain that flying is not permitted over Bahrain. Any visit to Jufair will be by invita tion and properly conducted. As there is no proper Royal Air Force base here yet no other restrictions seem necessary. 3. Senior Naval Officer is at my request enquiring about direction taken by Sata on leaving Singapore. 4. Commander of Sata is apparently full Captain in Japanese Navy. Although I call first on Captains in British Navy I am not sure if this applies also to Cap tain in a foreign navy and would request instructions.

Bahrain PoliticalNote of discussion with Mr. Deagon . Mr. Deacon came to see me this morning and showed me a letter which he had received from his Principals in which he was informed that they did not wish the officers or crew of the Japanese faval Tanker ,, 3ata ,, to visit the Bahrain Petroleum Company 1 s premises in Bahrain in any cir cumstances whatsoever. 2. The M Sata ,, is due to arrive at Bahrain on the 7th February 1938 and it was arranged with Mr. Deacon that she should go straight iru^to the outer berth at Sitrah for loading. It was suggested that the Company might send a wireless message on the 5th evening enquiring the hour at which the Sata would definitely arrive so that arrangements can be made for prompt berthing at whatever time she does turn up. Mr. Deacon stated that the berth ing and loading would take roughly 24 hours and it was ag reed that the Company*s representative who first boards the Sata will take with him a copy of the Bahrain Government*s order prohibiting landing at Sitrah. All tests will be done at the pier, and documents will be taken down to the ship for signing. There -a**®**^ thus be no excuse whatsoever for any member of the Japanese crew to land at Sitrah. The Adviser to the Bahrain Government will be a sked to send Police down to Sitrah v/hile the Sata is berthed in order to prevent landings in case the Japanese make difficulties with the Company 1 s representatives. 3. The Political Agent will be informed by the Company of the hour at which loading will finish and the Sata can leave the Sitrah berth. He will meanwhile have informed the Captain that the Bahrain Government wish the Sata, if she/-p, she is staying at Bahrain, to come round to the hanamah anchorage in accordance with ordinary practice when foreign warships visit Bahrain. 4. Mr. Deacon was informed that v/hile it is impossible to prevent members of the Ship* s Company from landing in Hahpa Manamah every possible/will be taken to ensure that none of them get out to the Camp or Refinery. Mr. Deacon will inform the Police guards at the gates that they are to refuse entry to any Japanese (in case any one of them evades more distant controls) but he asked that the Adviser should himself issue similar orders to the Police guards at the Camp and Refinery. step 30th January 1938 &lt;&gt;aBEfisiSUas&amp;Bs D.0.NO.C/8S-16/4 The 3Cth January 1938* My dear Deacon, I enclose herewith a note of our conversation this morning.

As I informed you the 3ata is due to arrive here on the 7th February and accord ing to her programme will leave on the 13th* Deacon has agreed to arrange for her loading to be done immediately she arrives and I v/ill infom the Captain either direct or through Dray Mackenzie (assuming that the latter are acting as Agents) that the Bahrain Government wish her to come round to the Manamah anchorage immediately load ing is finished. Could you arrange for a small police guard at Sitrah v;hile loading is going on f and also in form the Camp and the Kefinery guards that they are not to allow any Japanese to pass them? 2 * I showed you 3ir Trenchard’s telegram this morning in which he suggested that the Senior Naval Officer mi^t wireless a friendly warning to 3ata before she arrives here that aircraft are not allowed to fly over Bahrain; if the warning goes, there will be no need for anything from me. If not either an officer from Deptford or I myself will warn the Captain on arrival. 3. I will ensure that the Captain is informed of the Bahrain Government’s wish that the Sata should come round to Manamah inmediately after loading and I expect he will comply. If not, so much the better for us - in a way. We shall then have an excuse for keeping a petrol boat sitting by her the whole time. I shall call in any case inmediately/- Da lrymple Belgrave, Ksquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, i w i Bahrain.immediately she leaves the berth at the Sitrah oil terminal and wi3.1 inform the Captain of the 'unfortunate existence of some anti-Japanese feeling here which will compel arrange ments to be made as unobstrusively as possible for the pre vention of any unfortunate incidents'. In other words, could you arrange for plenty of nature to be on hand at the Customs pier to attach themselves quietly and unobstrusively to land ing parties but not to interfere in any way unless any of them start wandering out of the tovm. I suggest that should any walking party get beyong 5 miles from the pier the natur should try to motion them back in the direction of the town, and if they refuse he should hurry to the nearest Police con trol point and the Police might go out and fetch them in, again on the excuse of protecting them 'from possible trouble from anti-Japanese villagers'* I understand that by a strange coincidence there are to be 'police exercises” during the pe riod the data is here which may involve posts on the Jebel and Budaiyah roads, duch posts would, I suppose, turn back cars containing Japanese in case they get into trouble with 'anti-Japanese Arabs'• 4. You said you would tell taxi owners and drivers in no circumstances to drive any Japanese party in the Jebel or Re finery direction, and that boat and launch owners will be told not to land Japanese parties anywhere along the coast. 5. I will also tell the Captain that the Bahrain Govern ment, in their anxiety to ensure the welfare of their Japanese visitors, would prefer no landings between dusk and dawn. 6 . The Japanese officers may be invited to visit Jufair, in which case they will be escorted by some one from Beptford. I will inform you of the date end hour fixed if it comes off. 7. ' hen I see the Japanese Captain I think I should in form him that His Highness is away but that the Regency Council/--**i Tim «3~ Council will be glad to receive a visit. This is of course a nuisance for you, but I think it ought to be done, unless you or the Shaikhs have any strong objection. I will in form the Shaikhs of the impending visit on Wednesday next, 8 , Do you think this covers the whole ground or do you see any loopholes? Yours sincerely, l$ Telegram From To Repeated S.

Mr. Ballantyne telephoned to-day with reference to the proposed visit of the Japanese transport ship 'Sata-’ to Bahrein. He stated that information was received in the London Office of the Bahrein Petroleum Company on Saturday morning (in a letter from ^r. Herron, president of the Company in America) to the effect that the M Sata n (which would be manned by officers and men of the Japanese Imperial Navy) was calling at Bahrein about the 7th February to collect part of a consignment of fuel oil which had been sold some months ago to the Japanese Imperial Navy. The letter went on to say that the Japanese had requested that facilities might be granted to the officers of the ship to inspect the Company’s operations etc., both at Bahrein and on the mainland of Saudi Arabia. In no circumstances were the Company prepared to allow this. The letter indicated, however, that the American side were prepared to acquiesce in the arrangement for the n Sata n to collect the oil at Bahrein, provided that this was done as expeditiously as possible. Mr. Ballantyne then went on to say that following a consultation between Mr. Moffatt (the Chairman of the Bahrein Petroleum Company) Mr. Hamilton and himself, Mr. Moffat had telephoned to America and had persuaded Mr. Herron to arrange for the oil to be delivered at Singapore, thus making it unnecessary for the u Sata If to go to Bahrein at all. Mr. Ballantyne stated that we were at liberty to make such use as we liked of the information which he hadgiven me and he suggested that it might he useful if the Political Resident or the Political Agent at Bahrein discussed the matter with the Company 1 s local representatives.

The only exception to this rule is that British Naval Officers are allowed to land from sloops at Jufair t which is their Naval Base| and should you or any of your officers be invited by the Commander of H.M.S.

L,Adviser. After leaving the Agency in company of Lt. C. lAKiMURA and 4 other Warrant Officers we visited Ashraf f s shop where Lt. NAKAMURA’s chief enquiries were about Bahrain map and any other historical book about Bahrain. We then went to Suk-al-Gomash where he, Lt. Nakamura examined verious kinds of Pearls and noted the value, from there we went i6 Meat, fish and vegetable market and simi larly the Lieutenant noted the price of the verious items. We then went to the Portuguese fort and the Lieutenants enquiries on the way were about number of British residents in Bahrain, number of Taxis and soldiers etc.,to all his questions evasive answers were given. The Lieutenant then took 4 snapshot of a hut near the Portuguese fort and handed over this booklet (enclosed herewith) to one the Arabs who happened to be probably the owner of the hut, but the book-let was taken away from the owner without the Lt’s knowledge. The Lieutenant then enquired my views about the Japan Chinese war, but he was very politely informed that I had no idea on the subject, being very busy man with my private domestic affairs. They left the Pier at about 2. 45 P. M. and informed me that they will come to-morrow morning at about 10 A. M. Bahrain map has not been purchased yet.

We had made fairly elaborate preparations here for this visit, including the reissue of a Bahrain Government Notification absolutely prohibiting all landings at Sitrah, the location of police poet a on the roads out of anamah in the Jebel direction, numbers of nature stationed at the entra nce to the customs pier to shadow parties landing, police in a dhow lying in sight of the Sate to signal whenever parties put off in launches, and so on and so forth. By an extraordi nary coincidence the Police were also having exercises on the neck of land running across from the see on the north to the top end of the Khor lupin on the south, and the existence of strong anti-Japanese feeling both in the towns snd the villa ges was w discovered w a short time ago. In point of fact this is not such an exaggeration ee it sounds, since everyone here exhibits the utmost dislike for the Japanese coupled with com plete sympathy for the Chinese. I might quote the remark of a man who was peeping over the Agency wall when the Japanese officers called on me - he wee heard to say n *Tow indeed I know they are devils'. Full use was made of this enti-Japanese feeling, and we were able to insist on parties of officers going about together, accompanied by interpreters. 6l J ble Lieutenant-Colonel ^ Trenchard Fowls. K.C.I.E., C.B.K., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain.- 2 - 3* T he 3ata arrived about 8 a.m. on the 7 th February, and after a display of indifferent seamanship succeeded in tying up at the Sitrah terminal roughly 3 ^ hours later• iJuring this time an officer^ from Deptford was aboard and his remarks about Japanese ways of handling ships and about the two fried eggs which he was given to stave off the pangs of hunger sre interesting but scarcely repeatable. Once they were tied up, loading proceeded at once and was finished the following morning, the 8 th February* All documents were taken aboard for signature, and all apparatus necessary for tests was also taken down to the Seta. She then sailed out of the Sitrah anchorage and did her best to comply with the Bahrain Government's wish that she should anchor off ! anamah. As however she was drawing roughly 30 feet the nearest she could get was something like 18 miles out from the Customs pier, in a north-easterly direction f**om Muharraq. I must admit that we had not realised she would be so low in the water and consequently would have to lie so far off, but apart from a sneaking feeling that we had been rather unkind we had no very serious regrets. Visits had been exchanged between the Captains of H.M.S. Deptford and data while she was lying at -&gt;itrah, and I myself went off on the afternoon of the 8 th Feb- ruary Ga H* fortunately I was able to borrow the Imperial Airways' launch as the Ssta really was an appalling distance out and in my own launch I should have taken something like six hours going and coming. The Sata is rather an elderly vessel and no cleaner than one might expect. The Captain and his officers possess a somewhat rudimentary knowledge of Eng lish, which helped them to evade my pointed question why on earth they had come to Bahrain, though I did succeed finally in pinning the Captain d own to the statement that the oil would have/-have been T, very expensive in Singapore'. By that time he was sweating profttsely and I thought it was only fair to change the subject. I was offered Japanese tea and saki and left after about an hour’s extremely polite conversa tion during which details for visits ashore were fixed up. 4 . On the 9th February the Captain came ashore accompanied by 8 of his officers, all of whom joined him in his return call on me. Vve again indulged in much polite conversation though by the end of an hour we were all short of subjects to talk about. On leaving the Agency the Captain and some of his officers went to Jufair by invitation and this party was adequately looked after by H.H'.S. Deptford who returned them to their launch at Kanamah pier about 2^ hours later, leanwhile the rest of the Japanese officers were taken round the town and out to the Portugese Fort on a sight-seeing trip. The Passport Officer was put in charge of them and I attach a copy of his report, which makes extremely amusing reading. The whole pa? ty left fc anamah pier at about 2.30 p.m. 5. On the following day, the 10th February, ten officers came ashore ©gain. They split into two parties and having failed in a rather ingenuous attempt to dump their guides, one party set off to i uharraq while the other went to the Portugese Fort. This visit ashore was comparatively short, and having apparently come to the conclusion that they were not going to pick up any Information really worth having they all returned to the 3ata about 12.30 p.m. I am told that on they both days .these* were extremely inquisitive, apparently finding English a much easier language when no Political or Naval offjU cers were about, but I gather that the information they obtain ed from their guides was astonishingly inaccurate. I may say that neither Belgrave nor I had given instructions that they were to have their legs pulled but it is evident that the guides/-guides enjoyed themselves enormously, though they observed with some pain that the Captain’s trousers had obviously been let out three times and that Japanese manners were by no means what we are used to in Bahrain# 6 . On the following two days a tremendous shamal blew and there was no possibility whatsoever of their coming ashore# If therefore they came to Bahrain with any ideas about spying they must have been dismally disappointed, though I dare say they took some photographs with telephoto lenses from the Sitrah anchorage. However as any one can do that and as one can buy photographs for a few annas I do not think that is much to worry about# We were all presented with Japanese tourist literature and pamphlets setting out the justice of Japan’s cause in China and both the Captain of H.M.S# Deptford and I were the recipients of horrible little vases. On our side we refused to allow them to pay for any taxis, so honours are even there# 7. The Sata was due to sail on the 13th February. The shamal was still blowing strongly most of the day and Jata indulged in some rather queer manoeuvres, coming quite close into Galall on the north-east corner of lluharraq, whet* she must very nearly have grounded before she steamed out into deep water again* During this time she was under observation from three police posts on fcuharraq Island# 3he put no launch es over and so cannot have done more than check a few sound ings# Judging from her previous efforts I should not be great ly surprised to hear that all this was due to her not being under proper controli She finally sailed about 10 p#m# Yours sincerely,Telegram From XX To Hepeated Mo.

They did not request inspection of any tests, though we were prepared to have an inspection test on the loading dock should they have done so. The papers were taken out and signed at the ship thus obviating anyone coming ashore. No one upon the vessel came ashore at Sitrah. The Commander however paid an official call on the British Navy representative at Jufair by special arrangement he made through the Political Agent. The ship is now anchored outside about 15 miles from Manama. I understand from the political Agent that^ She intends to stay in this vicinity until the 13th* During this period they may come ashore in Manama, but will not be allowed to inspect the Refinery.

Dear Gibson, With regard to the possible activities of the Japanese Trawler, SEINO'O IvIA.HU, in the Persian Gulf, I write to say that we have recently had this matter under consideration, and would like to make the following suggestions and comments. In the first place, we would again draw attention to the suggestion in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Admiralty letter M.04446/37 of 23rd September that, following the normal •practice inside territorial waters, the Japanese should be excluded altogether. The instructions to Sir R. Craigie, Foreign Office telegram No.443, imply that, if permission were sought, it might be granted. ^^ In the second place we feel it may be undesirable to supply the Japanese with any chart showing the banks in detail. They are inveterate j-oachers and will almost certainly take advantage of any information we give them. We would propose simply to mark all the v/atex’s outside territorial waters where they would not be allowed to fish and to t ell them that they cannot operate in these areas owing to longstanding exclusive rights of sedentary fishing. Thirdly, we think that it should be recognised that, if Japanese trawlers dob egin fishing in the Gulf, it will be impossible for our sloops there to shadow them effectively without neglecting other duties. We suggest therefore that consideration might be given to supplementing our efiorts by the Arabs themselves - e.g. by coast watchers. finally there is the question of the legal powers which His Majesty's Ships would require. In home waters His Majesty’s Ships on Fishery Protection duties act under ikson, Esc., IQ Off-: p c? '• t n ^ -l j- x o e , o. w . i . authority/*SMm authority conferred by Act of .Parliament. - see Sea fisheries Act 1883, and subsequent enactments. Powers of Arrest are conferred by Section 18, and there is also provision for trial and punishment of offenders. V/hilst we do not suggest that such complicated legislation would be necessary in the Gulf, it would seem that some sanction is necessary (under municipal as distinct from international law) if action is to betaken against the Japanese. :Je suggest that you should have this aspect of the matter examined from the legal point of view - for example, would the local Arab rulers have to pass ordinances forbidding fishing to other than Arab vessels in certain areas, and authorising His Majesty’s Ships to arrest such non-Arab vessels fishing in these areas and bring them in for trial, or is there any other way in which His Majesty’s Ships could be given those powers? 'The legal position under Municipal Law would, of course, have to be satisfactorily cleared up before His Majesty’s Ships could take action. I am sending a copy of this letter to Brenan au the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely, sii . (Sgd.) A. Seal.India Office, Wlii t e hal 1, 3. W. 1. f 2 ,8426/37. 1st January, 1938. Dear Seal, Would you kindly refer to your letter Ho.M.04446/37 of the 13th November, regarding the possible activities of the Japanese trawler n Shinkyo Maru M in the Persian Gulf. As regards your first point I should explain that the i ' o .^Instructions to Sir Robert Craigie were only intended as a diplomatic alternative to a definite prohibition. Please see paragraph 4 of my letter to Brenan of the 28th October, C No.P.Z.6894/37. Powle was certainly confident, when discussing the matter here in the autumn, that the Shaikhs would not disregard our advice and permit fishing by the Japanese. It is perhaps worth noting here that in the correspondence leading to the reference to the Law Officers in 1905 on the subject of the pearling banks it was stated by the Government of India that M the principal Chiefs have in the past expressed the view that the fisheries are common property and that no Chief has, therefore, the right to grant any concession to outside parties'. A valid concession could therefore not be obtained by a foreigner from any one Ruler. Further, in the summer of 1911 an assurance was obtained from all the Arab Shaikhs that they would not respond to overtures from any quarter for concessions for fishing on pearl banks over which they possess rights without first consulting-the Political Resident. We think in the circumstances you will agree that there is no need to rear any untoward consequence in practice from the formula proposed to be used in a communication to the Japanese Government. As regards your second point we agree that it might be undesirable to supply the Japanese with detailed charts2 . ^ ox t/TiQ pearling osnlcs and ■thai maps sliould simply be sunplied marking the areas outside territorial waters in which exclusive pearl fishing rights are enjoyed by the Arab Shaikhs. Perhaps the Senior Naval Officer might be asked to have such maps prepared in consultation with the political Resident in case they should be required at short notice? Your third point is one on which we shall have to seek the views of the Political Resident in the first instance* As regards your final point, please see the enclosed copy of a letter which I am sending to Brenan, to whom also a copy of this letter is being sent. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J. P. Gibson.P.z. 8426/37. Wh i t e h al 1 , 3. W. 1 . 1st January, 1938. Dear Srenan, Would you kindly refer to Foreign Office letter No.E. 6537/93/34 of the 10th November and connected correspondence about the possible activities of the Japanese trawler ,T Shinkyo Maru' in the Persian Gulf. As the scheme to send the trawler to Arabian waters appears to have been abandoned for the time being, no immediat action is repuired, but we think that it would be as well to consider at this stage what steps are required to protect Arab interests if the need should arise in the future, In this connection we have been looking at the suggestions and comment contained in Seal's letter No.M.04446/37 of the 13th November, and in particular the question of the legal powers which His \ A Majesty's ships would require. The question to be decided first is whether His Majesty's Government would approve the use of force by His Majesty's ships to prevent encroachment by foreigners on the Arab p ear l fisheries. As regards the recognition oy international law of the rights to be protected difficulty arises only in connexion with the pearling banks outside territorial waters. The Law Officers, when the matter was referred to them in 190a, considered that as a matter of international law the pearl banks are capable of being the property of the Arab tribes to the exclusion ox all nations, but they reached the general conclusion that it is not expedient to raise the question internationally by foicibly preventing vessels of foreign nationalities from fishing on the banks. We note from Baggallay's letter to Clauson No.E.7681/12/34 ox the 8th January 1937, (on the subject ox the prospective visit of a Danish fishing expert to the ^— — 7 — Persian/0 rJB Persian Gulf) that in Beckett's view prescriptive rights may he obtained to exploit the bed of the open sea for the purposes of pearl fisheries, etc. Is it the present view of the Foreign Office that the existence of Arab rights on the pearling banks outside territorial waters could be i I T successfully upheld, e.g. before an international tribunal, if forcible action by one of His Majesty's ships for the 3 protection of those rights were challenged by a foreign pov/er? No doubt we should, and would, use first all other x means short of actual force to keep intruders out, but unless we are prepared to use force in the last resort we need not pursue the question of securing the necessary legal powers for His Majesty's ships, so far as relates to action outside territorial waters? Whether forcible action by the Navy should in this connexion be limited to territorial waters or should extend to the pearling banks lying outside those limits we are inclined to think that the necessary powers might be provided by inducing all the Arab Rulers concerned to issue a proclamation, or carry out an exchange of letters with the political authorities, to the effect that pearl fishing by other than Arab vessels is forbidden by them, and that His Majesty's Government are authorised to take any necessary measures on their behalf to compel the removal of foreign vessels engaged in pearl fishing within their territorial waters (and on the pearling banks outside those limits). Owing to the difficulties raised by the common ownership of all the Arab Shaikhs in the pearling banks and the absence of suitable courts, or of the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction by His Majesty, in all the Shaikhdoms it hardly seems profitable to consider at present the possibility of further measures such as the arrest and trial of offenders? But the matter might be further considered if and when jurisdiction/jurisdiction is exorcised by His Majesty on the Trucial Coast under an Order-in-Council. Before considering the matter further and consulting the Political Resident we should be grateful if you would let us have your views. I am sending a copy of this letter to Seal. Yours sincerely,.—'h. I. SSihMmUmkSi P, Z. 1008/38 FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. E,48/&lt;I8/91 11th Fehruary, 1938. Dear GiDson, I write in reply to your letter No.P.Z.8426/37 of the 1st January to Brenan, who is away on leave, about the measures to he taken with regard to possible future encroachment by foreigners on the pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf. 2. This question has now been carefully examined in consultation with Beckett, and our general view of the position is as follows. 3. There appear to be two questions involved. The first is whether His Majesty's ships can be authorised to use force if necessary to prevent encroachment by foreigners on certain pearling banks which lie in the eastern waters of the Persian Gulf at more than three miles from the shore, but to which we consider that the Arab rulers under our protection on the western shore of the Persian Gulf have acquired an exclusive right for their respective nationals. As the use of the Navy to force foreign ships to leave the banks may cause representations to be made by the Powers concerned, the answer to this question depends in part upon whether we consider that we have sufficiently good legal grounds for claiming that the Arab rulers have acquired these rights for their subjects under international law. This point in turn depends upon two propositions:- (a) The proposition that it is possible to acquire an exclusive right to sedentary fisheries on defined banks beneath the high seas (a question of pure law) (b) the proposition that in fact the Arab rulers have acquired this right. 4. As regards (a), Beckett has observed that the bulk of English writers on international law (vide Westlake and Oppenheim)/sss SXSBSBaiBB£&amp;aau=a Opperilieim) appear to accept this proposition; the Law Officers of 1905 also did so. If it is considered worth while a more extensive search could be made into all the available boohs on the subject^ including those by foreign writers as well as English writers (particularly the French writer Gidel) and anything that may be available in the proceedings of the League of Nations codification work would have to be taken into account. Beckett considers that the result would probably show the balance of authority to be in favour of the proposition, but that it is impossible to say that the question is free from doubt. 5. As regards (b), the question depends upon our ability to show that, in fact, an exclusive enjoyment of the fisheries by the subjects of the Arab rulers has existed over a long period, and that the rulers have maintained their right, with or without British assistance, wdienever it has been challenged. In other words, it would be necessary to show that, although an occasional trespasser may have been let through, trespassers have as a general rule been effectually warned off. The Law Officers in 1905 appeared to feel that they had not'been quite sufficiently informed on this aspect of the matter, although on the whole they considered their case to have been adequately proven. We have no further information, but imagine that it could be shown that between 1905 and the present day the position has not worsened in this respect. At the same time, we think that it would be very desirable to obtain more detailed information on this aspect of the matter, and we should be grateful if the India Office could furnish us with the necessary material. Meanwhile, for the sake ox the argument which follows, I ill proceed on the assumption that we could show a good cas- on this aspect of the question also.6. Assuming that the answers to the two propositions defined in paragraph 3 would be found to be as I have described them above, the result of action by His Majesty’s ships might be that, while we should have a reasonably good legal case, such action might lead to international representations. It may not however be possible to keep trespassers off by other means, and if trespassers are not effectually kept off the legal right claimed would be weakened. Consequently, we are inclined to think that the right policy would be to allow His Majesty’s ships to act forthwith in any case where circumstances demand it, and to leave it to those who object to try to prove their case, if they can, as plaintiffs before an international tribunal. 7. The second of the questions mentioned in paragraph 3 concerns the provision of the necessary legal powers for such action as may be considered desirable. If His Majesty's ships are to act as proposed above, it will be necessary to invest them with specific authority to do so under some form of municipal law. Beckett considers that this authority must be derived from the rulers of the Arab States, but that, as these rulers do not possess jurisdiction over foreigners, or over all classes of foreigners, their proclamations or legislation should be supplemented by Kingte Regulations made under the various Orders in Council under which His Majesty’s Government exercises ex-territorial jurisidction in the Persian Gulf. The procedure required would seem to be that proclamations or laws should be issued by the Arab rulers, reciting that the fisheries have long been reserved to their nationals, and that other persons have always been forbidden to fish there by law; and then going on to state that in order that there should be no doubt on the point, the prohibition of other persons from exploiting the fisheries is now/now declared over again and that poachers or trespassers will be liable to certain penalties, and may be arrested by the authorities of the Arab ruler in question or by the authorities of the protecting Power acting upon the ruler's request. 8. King’s Regulations would then be made to which the Arab proclamations would be annexed, making enforceable the Arab rulers’ proclamations on British subjects and foreigners, and authorising His Majesty’s ships to take action against poachers and trespassers. In the case, however, of a ruler like the Sheikh of Bahrein, who has no jurisdiction over any except his own nationals, it may be questioned whether there is any necessity for any legislation at all, and whether a King’s Regulation is not all that is required, since the only people affected by the proposed legislation would be persons who are not subject to the Sheikh’s jurisdiction. In this case, a simple request from the Sheikh to His Majesty’s Government to legislate and to take action against the trespassers may perhaps be all that is required. 9. As regards the precise form of action to be taken by His Majesty’s ships, Beckett observes that, while poachers and trespassers who enter the territories or territorial waters of the Arab states after their poaching activities could properly be arrested and prosecuted, it is rather doubtful whether His Majesty’s ships could legally bring them into territorial waters by force. In the case of poachers and trespassers who are not British subjects or British protected persons, therefore, it appears that action by His Majesty’s ships should be confined to driving them away, since, even admitting the soundness of the case for the appropriation of the fisheries on the bed of the sea, there would still be a technical legal difficulty as regards arresting such persons,5. since they would presumably be caught at the surface of the sea, which cannot be appropriated and which must be admitted to be outside the jurisdiction of any State. 10. While I do not think v/e should see any objection to the enactment of the necessary municipal legislation and the issue of the appropriate instructions to His Majesty's ships, on the assumption that these measures are necessary to protect the pearl fisheries (and assuming that the answers to propositions (a) and (b) can be confirmed), I think the point ought to be considered whether the threat to the fisheries from Japanese or other quarters is really serious, for clearly these measures will draw a lot of publicity to a question upon which little light beats at present.

Owing to the measures which were taken by the Bahrain Government no unfortunate incidents occurred between the parties of naval officers and warrant officers who landed in Bahrain although the action of these persons who distributed propoganda lite rature to various Arabs, was, in the opinion of the Council, unsuitable and provocative.-2- 3.

At first sight the surest ion in paragraph 3 of V/eightman's letter of the 23M April appears to have a good deal to recommena it. If all the pearling banks are as Weightman presupposes, owned in common by the Sheikhs, has an interest in all the banks, it might be sufficient to have that Sheikh’s authority to drive away intruders, which is of more practical consequence than being able to arrest and punish them in the unlikely event of their subsequently entering an Arab Sheikh’s territory or territorial waters. p. In that case only one Proclamation or King’s regulation would be necessary but I think it must be recognised that even a single Proclamation or King’s Regulation might give rise to undesirable publicity. 4- The only snag which has occurred to us is that the other Sheikhs may be unwilling to accept a situation wnere all the action is taken under the legislation and at the request of one ruler alone.

Military Branch. 402589/38 10 th May, 1933. My dear Gibson, May I refer to your letter of 19 th April, No.P.Z. 2363/38 concerning the request of the Bahrain Government that in future visits of all foreign warships other than French should be strongly discouraged. The request covers.all foreign warships other than French and it may be that the Bahrain Government are thinking not only of Japanese, but also of possible Persian visits. 2. Legally any state has the right to forbid the visits of foreign warships to its ports and this right is in fact exercised by certain states, notably Japan. It has, however, been our consistent policy for some time to encourage the principle that, as a matter of courtesy, visits of warships should normally be allowed, provided a reasonable notification in advance is given. In general it is clearly to our advantage to continue this policy, even if we do dislike some of the visits paid. 3* In the S/.ta case, although ve did take steps to discourage the visit we did not actually forbid it and in the event of any further visits of Japanese warships to Bahrain or other uersian Gulf ports being notified, we should propose to take similar action. 7 e failed to prevent the visit of the Sata largely because t_.e vessel was already on her way before action was taken, and we feel that if anotner case arises there would be a reasonable chance of success if action were taken at once. The Japanese,/ ,jT ‘f. Gibson, Esq. , India Office, S.7.1.2. Japanese, v/ho refuse entry altogether for v/arslii -s to a considerable number of their ports ; are not very strongly V placed for insisting on visiting Bahrain. u , 4 4. fe should like to suggest therefore that rA n / A the reply to the Bahrain Government proposed by feightman ' shoala be somev/hat amplified, by including an explanation of the legal position and of the reasons for not asserting the right to refuse permission in normal cases, adding that H.ti. Government have noted their desire to avoid future visits of Japanese and other foreign warsimps (except French) to Bahrain, but that they will realise that the steps v/hich can be taken to discourage such visits must depend upon the circumstances of each case. 5.

J P. GIBSONi,Z,?521^8. gTDMTIAL 05695/38. Military Branch, Admiralty, S.W. 1 . &lt;\« \ f 5th Uoveir.ber, 1938. 1 - Dear Dibson, Vill you plaase refer to your letters P.Z.5432/58 of the 26th September and the Seth'October on the subject of the pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf ? Apart from the question of the interests of the Persians in the Arab fisheries, referred to below, there appears to us to oe no difficulty in maintaining the view - (i) that the Arao States have exclusive rights to the fisheries in their territorial waters. (ii) that they have established exclusive proprietary rights to fisheries outside territorial waters which it can be shown they have been accustomed to fish. (iii) that H.M.Government is entitled, in view of its special position in the Gulf, to exclude aliens, on behalf of any or all of the Sheikhs, freer, the above grounds. The difficulty therefore arises over (a) shallow beds outside territorial waters which the Arabs have not in fact worked. (o) deep oeds outside territorial waters, which the Arabs could not in fact fish without mechanical equipment. As regards (a), the Admiralty view is that we can safely take the line that, without the necessity for clear evidence that any particular bed has been worked, the shallow beets as a whole are subject to the exclusive right of the Arab Spates. It would indeed probably be impracticable to collect evidence that a particular bed has or has not been worked, and it would therefore be unsafe to/ J ibson , Esq. , Jndia Office, S.W. 1.2 . t0 ad ° Pt any P ro °edure requiring the production of such evidence. lh ° real difficu lty therefore arises over the beds at (b), i.e. those too deep for working by human agency alone, which the Arabs therefore could not have fished. As regards these beds we are unable to agree with the view in Baggallay's letter that they are not of sufficient interest to the Sheikhs to warrant protection from intrud ers. It seems clear that - (i) Local belief is that spoliation of the deeper beds would injure the shallow beds; (n) Any intrusion into the Gulf of expeditions equipped with modern apparatus would be or, ^‘ ^ resented by the Arabs who would consider we had failed to protect them; that the Japanese intruder beds? lne h:lmself strictly to the deep consider, therefore, that every effort should be made to protect the deep beds. Whether they can in fact be protected is a different matter, but for the present we would suggest that the most hopeful line seems to be to base our claim on the belief mentioned in Lorimer's Gazetteer that deep sea dredging would cestroy the colonies from which the shallow beds are recruited. r c would therefore seem to us very valuable if seme scientific evidence could be obtained in support of this belief and perhaps the India Office could undertake to secure some plausible evidence in favour of such a contention. Should the need for action arise before we have managed to establish a more or less legal claim, it will probably be necessary to adopt, so far as possible, apolicy of bluff. as m There should be no difficulty, the past, in adopting such a policy against non-Japanese intruders: whether or not it could be successfully adopted against the Japanese will no doubt have to be considered at the time when the need arises. Vie P-es ...c,, of course, that use would be made of such measures as withdrawing protection and refusing supplies, although this would probably not affect a self-contained Japanese unit. ii.ere is admittedly the further difficulty in that t-ie Tocation of the deep beds, - and indeed the existence of any deep beds, - does not seem to be known, but this appears inevitable so long as fishing in the Gulf is restricted to unaided human'divers. Possibly, however, there may be some local knowledge based on the explorations of sane particularly adventurous or skilful divers available in the Gulf which is not known in London. Perhaps therefore you could ask the local authorities to report all that they know. x G also that we should obtain some up to date information as to the exact interest of the Persians in tne fisheries not in their own territorial waters, as our infoimation at present seems to be based largely on the statement in Lorimer’s Gazetteer published in 1915. It seems, however,, that there is no great danger of arousing Persian opposition under the procedure suggested in the U overran ent of India’s letter of the 27th-April, 1938, since under this procedure the King's Regulation will not actually be published until the need arises for excluding an alien (and then with the minimum publicity).4. Moreover, the interests of the Persians would be the same as ours, namely, to keep out the alien and it is unlikely that they will feel moved to raise difficulties if they see we are taxing the odium for action which is equally in their own interests. While we do not, therefore, consider that Persian interest would be a bar to any action necessary to exclude intruders, it does seem desirable for the matter to be cleared up and perhaps you will ask your local advisers to report. ■/ith reference to paragraph 4 of your letter, we ould kave no objection to your revised wording, unless you would perhaps prefer 'fisheries in which Bahreini nationals have established proprietary rights”. As regards any action to be taken at the present we are entirely in agreement with the course suggested in the Government of India’s letter of the 27th April, 1938. I am sending a copy of this letter to Baggallay. Yours sincerely, i (Sd.) p.H.Jones.p z, 704 1/38. INDIA OPFICB, (m) t \ J Dated 13th Dot. / WHITISH ALL, S.W.l. 26th October 1938. Dear Jones, Would you please r^/er to my letter to Jarrett of the 26th September, No. ]/Z. 5432/38, regarding the protection of the Arab pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf from encroachment by foreigners. Before replying thereto the Admiralty may wish to see the enclosed copy of Baggallay's « Jones , Bsq. , Admiralty. reply to the similar letter which I sent to him. \ r 2. As regards the deep water beds referred to in para .2 of his letter, the Government of India's letter of the 27th July, while assuming their existence, gives no definite information about them. Lorimer (p.2244) mentions the view of some authorities that 'the effect of deep-sea dredging would be to destroy the colonies from which the oysters upon the shallow beds accessible to native divers are recruited.' If this view is correct the Arabs might have a very s-ood reason for feeling aggrieved if the deep water beds were exploited by foreigners. But it is difficult to see what effective action can be taken if the Arabs have no valid claim to rights over those beds. The problem was m fact dealt with in the reference made to the Law Officers in 1904. In their opinion they drew a distinction between the pearling banks resorted to by the Arabs outside territorial waters and the deeper waters which had not yet been fished by pearl divers. They reported that they could not see that 'the right claimed by the tribes to exclude other nations from these deeper waters could be asserted with any reasonable chance of success'. In respect both of the deeper waters and of the pearl banks outside the three-mile limit they recommended that foreign interf erence/&lt;v /V 2 . interference should be discouraged by the refusal of supplies, etc., as had been suggested by the Government of India. 3. As regards paragraph 4 of Baggallay's letter it is an unwelcome complication that the Arab Sheiks may not after all possess an exclusive prescriptive right to the pearling banks outside territorial waters. Possibly the prohibition on poachers to be enforced by a King's Regulation could, if necessary, be framed so as not to apply to Persians; e.g. it might extend only to persons who are not nationals of countries bordering on the Persian Gulf (though this would let in Iraqis and Saudis). The Persian Government could not then complain that the rights of their nationals were affected. They might, however, object to our assuming, without their consent, the rdle of protector of rights shared by their nationals with our prot^s. The question how far Persians share with Arabs prescriptive ngnts m the pearling banks on the Arab side of the Gulf is one on which we shall have to consult the Political Resident. 4. I might also mention a minor point of drafting tnPt occurs to^ in connexion with Baggallay's letter. It would hardly be correct to speak of the fisheries long reserved to. Bahreini nationals when the banks are the common property of all the tribes. Perhaps something like 'fisheries which have long been operated by Bahreini nationals' would do. 5- I am sending a copy of this letter to Baggallay. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J.P. GIBSON.p 7.7C41 /38 . (s 56S7/43/91) FOREIGN OFFICE, 13th October, 1938. My dear Gibson, f *v&gt; ! Many thanks for your letter P.Z. 54^2/38 of the 26th September last about the question of protecting the Arab pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf against encroachments contained in the Government of India*s letter about the presence of pearl fishing beds in deep water in the Persian Gulf which have never been exploited by the Arab Sheikhs. T .e did not realise that such beds existed and I think it is clear, although I have not verified this point, that no question of claiming them has ever arisen before. Lorimer»s Gazetteer merely states (Volume 1 , Part II, page 2,221, paragraph 5) that it is possible that such deep sea pearl ban'Cs exist, and I imagine that even now very few people share this knowledge. Assuming that they do exist, however, we agree with the Government of India that the Arab Sheikhs would have no legal claim to them, and, this being so, we do not think that it would be possible, whatever the circumstances, to issue a warning-off notice in respect of tne^e beds or take 'orcible action to prevent anyone from fishing there, however damaging to British prestige in the Gulf such inaction might be. Since, however, the Arab Sheikhdoms have never exploited these banks, there-seems no reason why they should be aggrieved if foreigners do so, or why the prestige of His Majesty's Government should fall if they allowed it, even though the Sheikhs might say that they would have used the banks if and when they had known of their existence and possessed the by foreigners. We were very interested in the new information necessary equipnent.3. A As regards the pearling banks lying (l) within territorial waters and ( 2 ) in shallow waters outside this limit (I note in this connexion that Lorimer says they occur anything up to 70 miles from the coast), we agree that in view of the considerations mentioned in the Sovernment of India's letter it might be undesirable to risk representations from the Iranian Government by issuing a proclamation now, but that there would be no harm in having a Proclamation and King's Regulation in readiness for use in case any attenpt should be made on these banks. In view, however, of the distinction between these banks and those lying in deep water, the King's Regulation would have to be arefully worded so as to avoid making it apparent that this distinction existed, e.g. it might refer to the 'fisheries which have long been reserved to Bahreini nationals' or words th .t effect. This would have the advantage of not ccnmitting His Majesty's Government either way as regards the deep sea banks and at the same time of discouraging would-be poachers, who would probably be unaware of the distinction between these banks and the others. If, however, His Majesty's Ships were then authorized to take forcible action, they would, I think, have to be instructed only to do so in the case of those banks to which the Arab Sheikhs have a reasonable claim. 4. There is one further point which we think merits investigation. On page 2240 of Lorimer it is stated that 'On the Arabian side all the banks, whether near 'or far from the coast, are free to the pearl-fishers 'of Arabia and Persia without distinction of race or 'nationality'. If this statement is accurate it may be difficult to exclude Persians frcm the banks on the basis of prescription. Moreover it is hardly consistent with the infoimation on the subject apparently given to the Law Officers on which they based/tssed their opinion of 11th February, 1905 (see page 2248 of lorimer). it seems from the information in Lorimer that the Persians have continued to keep the banks on the Persian Si&lt;le f ° r th « T,selve8 * b«t have habitually fished on the Arabian j banks.

Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.3.E. , '•Britannic Majesty's Consulate-General, Bushi re .,7697/38. JT jff/38/91) . As regards the oyster 'beds in deep waters, I cannot see that we have a legal case for keeping anybody away thorn them. Even if it were the case that we could establish that sea dredging on the deep sea beds would totally destroy the utility of the beds in shallow water which can be and have I been appropriatedthat would not give any legal claim to keep other people off the deep sea beds. The point is just the same as that in the big seal fisheries arbitration, where the United States tried to contend that because the unrestricted catching of seals outside U.S. jurisdiction destroyed the seal fishery within U.S. jurisdiction therefore they must have some right to take action outside their territorial limits in order to protect their fisheries inside their territorial limits, but the U.S. Government failed. The argument is much the same as that which Norway makes when she tries to exclude British trawlers from banks outside Norv/egian territorial waters as we measure them, and of course any number of claims to exercise jurisdiction on the high seas could be based on this ground. As regards the other point, the first thing is clearly to ascertain whether it is in fact true that Persians have resorted to and are resorting to the pearl banks in shallow water. If they are, then Persia shares the prescriptive right to these banks in shallow water outside the three mile limit, but I do not think it shows that there can be no prescriptive right at all. It would become a prescriptive right enjoyed by the natives of countries bordering on the Persian Gulf. The difficulty, however, would be that in theory/f Persia' would 'be entitled to share in the action to keep other people off and might contend that she should he consulted and agree in what action should he taken. However, as long as Persians were not excluded I do not think Persia v/ould have a very serious complaint, legal or otherwise, if the Arah rulers issued laws formally excluding non-Persian Gulf natives from the hanks and entrusting our navy v/ith the duty of policing the hanks and our navy acted accordingly.

In the past three or four Persian boats have dived on the banks which are mainly used by the Bahrain fleet, but this practice ceased some years ago. Persian boats go to the banks between Halool and Das Island which are regarded as being Q,atar and Oman banks. They avoid the Bahrain banks owing to a Persian law whereby Nakhudas are res ponsible to the Persian Government if any of their M divers run away. Few if any Bahrain boats go to Halool and Das for diving though Bahrain buyers still purchase pearls there. The following are the chief banks used by Bahrain diving boats:- North:'Mayanah', app.53 miles from Manama T.

On the outbreak of the Great v/ar the pearlers volunteered for service abroad to a man. During the ,Var the Japanese dis played great activity in the fishing of the inferior but abundant trocaa shell, and this quickly replaced the genuine mother-of-pearl for such purposes as shirt-button making. The result was a drop in the price of pearl shell that has continued, xhe ingenious Japanese also commenced the cultivation of pearls. This has meant that the genuine pearl - although maintaining a price far above that of pearl artifieally produced or manulactured - is worth far less than in pre-.7ar days.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to invite your assistance in regard to a matter connected with the pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf. These fisheries are an important, indeed in some c^ses Principal means of livelihood of the Independent oheihhdoms of North Eastern Arabia over whom the British Government exercises a certain measure of control and protection. Exploitation is conducted entirely by the local inhabitants without any sort of modern equipment, and is accordingly restricted to the summer months and to shoals at a depth of not more than 20 fathoms. Government has consistently discouraged attempts by European firms to enter this trade, in view of the economic effects which competition based on the use of modern equipment would exercise on these small communities. There is a strong local belief, naturally untested, that these shallow beds are recruited annually from certain deepsea beds, inaccessible to local methods and that any attempt to fish from these deep sea beds also would be disastrous to the productivity of the area as a whole. The Persian Gulf fisheries have never apparently been studied from this point of view by a competent marine biologist, and as a matter of interest and for future reference Lord setland would be glad to have an authoritative opinion on Secretary, this/ me British Museum (Natural History), Cromwell Road, S.W.7.131110 theory, bo.sod on experience gained from observation in other eaters, either in connection witli pearling or with other fisheries of a similar nature.

The chief enemies of the pearl oysters are not the pearl fishers but rays and other fishes and molluscs. wou ia appear that in the case of the Persian Gulf the conditions under heading (4) differ from those in Ceylon, but those indicated under the other headings are likely to be similar m both cases. Since the oysters begin to reproduce at least a year before they are fit to fish, the fishing is unlikely to affect the maintenance of the stock unless it is conducted on such lines as to destroy the mature oysters which begun to produce pearls, a deep-sea pearl fishery _ cut the .opinion of those 13 that if such a fishery were established it would be scarcely likely to affect the oyster population in the shallower beds. have not yet suppose that established, There is no reason to could profitably be who have been consulted comments ihe Trustees directed me to transmit the fore oing . n with tile reservation that they emanate from men whose knowledge is not derived from actual experience of pearl fishing.

To The Under Secretary of State for India. Sir ir, ^ V In reply to your letter P.Z.4225/39 of 12.7.39 I may say that when Director of the Sudan Government Pearl Fisher*/ I obtained what information was then available on the Persian Gulf Pearl Fisheries. It yjqs not much, as evidently they had never been examined by a \ V biologist, and nothing was known about them from the fisherman's point of view. There has recently been a Danish Scientific Fisheries Expedition to the Gulf. / I gather that its work was principally on the Iranian side, the headquarters of the pearling boats and trade being at Bahrein, on the western side. Would you like me to enquire whether they saw anything of the Pearl Fishery? (i) There are two pearl oysters which are fished in the Gulf, for the small oyster, Pinetada vulgaris (the name has been changed again , but vulgar is is the name in any oyster, P. ma rg ar it if er a , Arabic T sadaf ’ known to the t r ad e as T! 13 omb ay S he 11. valueless. Therefore there can be no practical fishery Meanwhile the following information may be usefulo- literature which matters) Arabic Bilbil, and the large as I found during my work in the Fed Sea, where both occur. unless the oyster occurs in vast numbers. In the case ofpearls adding something like 10$ to 20$ to their value. (4) In the Red Sea Bilbil is occasionally taken, but the fishery is almost entirely for sadaf. The methods used differ completely from those of Ceylon, the only fishery which has been reported upon by a biologist. (5) I do not know how fishing is done in the Iranian Gulf. It is suite possible that the same boat may take both species. (6) Prom my experiences with diving dresses in the Red Sea I decided that, unless shell is very thick on the bottom, as on my artificial beds, naked diving v as the cheaper. Europeans often seem to have the fixed idea that modern machinery is sure to be the more efficient, and the fact that I did not find it so in the Red Sea (except in the very special circumstances of my artificial beds) might save trouble in dealing YJith the requests referred to in yoor letter 2118/39 to the Director of the iTaturrl History Museum. ' ^ (7) The same letter refers to fishing on 'shoals at a depth of not more than 20 fathoms 11 . Rone of my divers could descend to greater depths than 10 fathoms, snd then it vas a haphazard performance only indulged in oj negroes. I do not think any naked diver can go deeper than this, and 20 fms is deep even for a man in a diving suit. (8) As regards the natural History Museum’s letter. Per. 1 refers only to Ceylon. In the Red Sea both species occur from low spring tide level bo 10 fathoms, and probably deeper, if the bottom below that depth is not all mud. Par. 2 Reproduction begins, in both species in the summer after that in which the young were liberated. I-- Sadaf the floating young are produced at intervals from June to September. They thus reproduce several yo c r^ before they are fishable.P ar. 5. The better zrovn the G-ell the oetter the pearl, ai:Ct, oil ecuroo , the old s u e 11 s arL, in general / the only ones linely to contain pearls oi any size. It is not true, for sadaf, that stunted and deformed shells produce a greater value of pearls. Par.4. Pilbil in the Hod Sea, as in Ceylon is a delicate creature vhich I found difficult to rear above the age of one or tv;o years. Sadaf, on the other hand, is very hardy. In my opinion it is likely that to this constitutional delicacy should bo attributed the fact that the Ceylon fishery is productive only at intervals of several years. ^ar.S. ShalJ-on and accessible beds can easily be overfished. (Those in Ceylon are neither shallow nor accessible). I believe that the natural population of the shallows of Dongonab Bay was replenished by the spat from the deeper water, without which they would have been permanently denuded. Apart from this the shells from deeper water wore of little value, being stunted and heavily parasitised. I made calculations which showed that the imposition of a very moderate size limit in the Bed Sea would increase the value of the native fishery by about 30)1. The Arabs and Bisharin were taking the smallest shells seen, the vrlue of which was almost, nothing, and they probably do the sane in the Iranian Gulf. Owing to the number of Governments concerned it was impossible to impose even this s imp 1 e regiilation. It may interest you to know that I have written a full account of my 17 years’work as Director of the Sudan Government Pearl fishery, in which i describe the discovery and application of methods of cultivation on the large pearl shell, for which - hope to find a publisher, as these discoveries, if published, are certain to be found useful sometime in the future, in some part of the /I cr. sending a copy of this letter to the Director of the Natural History Huscum for the completion of his files.

It is noted from paragraph 1 of the above-quoted express letter that the extent of Persian interest in the pearling banks resorted to oy the Arabs is small. There is therefore no need to consult with the ifersian Government in any action taken for the protection of Arab interests. it will however be necessary, whether by specific provision in the drafting - of the relevant King’s Regulation or by reference in the T39, ao.216-3, and connected correspondence instructionsA- _ instructions which may, if the need arises, he issued to nis Majesty’s ships, to ensure that Persian fishermen are not interfered with in any steps that are taken to expel i oreigiiers from the Arao pearl hanks. The whole position would of course require to he reviev/ed if Arah interests were to suffer as the result of a substantial increase in the numbers of Persian boats operating on the Arah hanks. 4. ,/i th regard to the action to he taken for the protection territorial waters, the conclusions reached in the previous correspondence on this subject indicated the desirability Bahrein Order in Council, for which the authority of a written request from the Sheikh of Bahrein would he made available, and which would not he issued until the need should arise and would then he given the minimum publicity. This Regulation v/ould provide the legal basis for the issue of instructions to Kis Majesty’s ships. It seems desirable that an approved draft King’s Regulation should he available, even though the occasion for resorting to it may he remote. Please therefore prepare a draft in the light of the earlier correspondence and submit it through the Government of India. of Arah interests in the shallow hanks lying of having in readiness a draft King’s Regulation under the The issue of the above has been duly authorised.

There are three points raised in Mr. de Grenier T s letter:- 12 of File 9/8. In the case of the Yoshida Maru,His Majesty T s Government did not agree to the Bahrain Govern ments suggestion that she should not be allowed to visit Bahrain and added that ’’You may therefore, if you think it desirable, impress upon State in whatever manner you think suitable that in future similar cases Resident should be consulted before any decision is taken”. The general question of excluding Japanese shipping is, however, still under consideration. « Re: (ii) . Please see Landing Contract at Page 111 (Office file 7/3). Ships of Japanese Nationality are not covered by this agreement, and presumably the Landing Company can charge any rate they like, as was done in the case of the Yoshida Maru. Re:(iii) . It is not /possible for the local autnorities to take any action to prevent the steamer calling at a mainland port.

Frem January 1 st this year about 50,000 bags have been landed at Bahrain* Whenever necessary shipments of rice can be made from Bombay but the freight will obviously be greater for small than for large shipments* 80^ of the rice shipped is from Buxma and 20# from Bengal. Lalchand arranged for the shipment of 50,000 bags fiom Calcutta dna Rangoon by chartering a B*X* steamer. When he heard of the shipment of Rangoon rice in a Japanese steamer he cancelled his order. He estimates that with the normal customs and landing charges the rice shipped in the Japanese steamer by Haridas Janimal will cost 1/2 as less than his rice per bag. There are two firms shipping rice to Qatif. Ifd. Mirzuk, agent Abdul Aziz Bassan, and Haridas Janimal, agent Kaxko Bunya. Apparently the rumour is that both these firms have lent money to Bin Saud through his agentsAkhil bin Abdul Aziz Awazi ir; Bahrain and Ifd. Tawil in the Hejaz at present. The agent cf Haridas Janimal at ^atif is Chaturbuj, a Hindu from Karachi, These two firms recoup themselves by net paring the Najdi custons of 3 /-K 3 per bag. It is rumoured that Haridas Janimal have lent 30,000/-Bs to Bin Saud. Two shipments of ixp rice by Japanese steamers have been arranged and five days remain in which a further shipment cel can be ordered from Bahrain vide the monopoly for Bahrain obtained by Haridas Janimal for April, May and June.

H- L \H(2) Letter No:P/53 dated 17/7/1934 from Mespers Limited, Bahrain. On the evening of the 17th June I took the opportunity, when returning from seeing the Resident off, of going into the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited to see Mr. Russell. I asked him 'whether he thought that he could arrange for discharging a vessel at Qatif. He thought that it would be very difficult as, although he could arrange to send coolies on board the steamer, he did not think that he could spare lighters. I said that in any case I thought that he would have difficulties with the Sa*udi authorities over sending coolies and clerks, with which he agreed. I said that I thought that the best plan would be to reply that he could not arrange to discharge the steamer at Qatif but could arrange for direct overside delivery at Bahrain. I pointed out that this would be more convenient for him and that he would get his ordinary agency profits, that the idea of lightering here would be easier and that if the steamer was to go to Qatif it would mean that the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited would probably have to follow suit which they did not like to do, and incidentally that the it would mean the 2% transit dues for the Bahrain Government. Mr. Russell is going to reply on these lines and will send me a copy of his reply. He mentioned that he had twice been to Qatif and that it was a very unpleasant harbour to get into owing to the tortuous channel, and that Ras T&amp;nurah would be better but he thought it undesirable to put the idea into their heads. 2 . I also mentioned the question of the agency here. Mr. Russell wrote in his lette to the Director of Customs that he had been asked to unload the steamer 'in the same manner' as those of Messrs Frank C. St ick &amp; Company (Busra) '‘imited, but this i means only that the usual arrangements will be made and does not effect the probability of the landing charges being increased in the case of these steamers. This is entirely justified in view of the fact that the present landing charges are /economicalIMICROFILM INDIA OFFICE LIBRARY and RECORDS Photocopying record Ref ’ No ’ &lt;2-1 Date Name Process No. of exposures 1 •&gt;^2_ro^L 2 10- Or- 3 4 5 6 REFER TO THE SPECIALIST CONCERNED</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000398_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/553</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000398</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/553</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'16/4 JAP.
