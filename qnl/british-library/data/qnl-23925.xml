Investment Scheme A Investment Scheme B Investment Scheme C Investment Scheme D Investment Scheme E Investment Scheme F Investment Scheme G DO YOU REALISE that Insurance to-day and for the future, with its modern developments, is one of the few sound non-depreciating investments and comparable with first-class securities? Almost every big Insurance Company offers schemes tor investment—we can help you with advice with all these. DO YOU REALISE that as a parent you can ensure the proper education of your child or children, whether you live or die? This is far better than taking the gamble that when the time comes you will be still alive and will be able to mee school bills comfortably from your income. Your child’s chance in life can be assured. DO YOU REALISE that parents can take out Life Assurance Policies for their children’s lives at very low rates, and after 21 {without increase of premium) the insured can take them on? Just consider what you would have saved in premiums if your parents had done this for you. DO YOU REALISE that a married man can protect and provide for his wife or family (or even his own old age) and ensure an income sufficient to keep them without undue privation or disturbance in their mode of life should he die? How many widows and children suddenly have to drop from a fair standard of i e to absolutely penury and want, when there is no need for it if gradually provided against year by year by carefully thought out Insurance? DO YOU REALISE that unmarried men and women can assure, definitely, an income to live on in old age, come what may. Have you heard of the profit-sharing pension schemes? DO YOU REALISE that by Insurance you can provide for the repayment of mortgages or loans when you die? These liabilities may be a crushing calamity to those dependent on what you leave Kir them. Again, you can provide tor the payment of Estate duties, thereby preserving your savings intact for your dependents, obviating forced sales of your securities or other effects. DO YOU REALISE that if you wish to benefit the living, an Annuity for the llf&lt; = of one or more persons is the best way to get the largest possible income with absolute certainty from your capital? How many people struggle to exist on income only from invested capital, whereas they would get far more from Annuities, with absolute certainty and absolute safety from fluctuation? Insurance to-day is a highly specialised business, unbiassed and expert advice is more than ever necessary in the selection of the particular policy you need. There is no need for you to wade through 100 different prospectuses each containing a multiplicity of schemes.

Governments, British and Colonial ; also to the Principal Foreign Governments. Optical Works: CLAPHAM COMMON, LONDON, S.W.4 Telegraphic Address : Telephones : “Rossicaste, ’Phone, London.” Macaulay 2472 (two lines)2 FOREWORD The last few years has seen considerable development in the manufacture of prism binoculars as will immediately be shown by a comparison between glasses obtainable at the end of the war and those we are making to-day. There are many reasons for this, some too technical for the lay mind to appreciate, but principally the improvements are due to great advancements made in the manufacture of British Optical Glass, to finer instruments for testing both the glass and the finished prisms and lenses, and to greater accuracy in manufacture. The principal features that will appeal to the users of binoculars in which improvements have been made are, increase in the angle of view, greater and more even illumination, and definition. In our E.W.F. series of binoculars the field of view has been increased by 40%, the angle being extended from 50° to 70°. In some of the binoculars the illumination has been increased at the centre of the field 20% and at the margin more than doubled, thus giving an almost uniform illumination over the whole field. All object glasses and prisms in Ross Prism Binoculars are tested on the interferometer and none but those giving practically theoretical resolution and perfect definition are passed on for assembly into the finished product. It can therefore be claimed that the advance in binocular manu facture has resulted in glasses being produced as superior to the binoculars of the war as were those glasses to the old galileans now often seen in antique shops. The following pages should be carefully considered by all interested in the purchase of optical instruments whilst the follow ing figures, the result of authoritative independent tests, prove the superiority of Ross products over those of other manufac turers both at home and abroad.

In his letter Dr. (now Sir Frank) Smith showed that there were no grounds for belief in the superiority of foreign glass and optical instruments, that the British products were inferior to none, and that a steady effort was being made further to improve their quality. It is even now, as it was in 1925, of high importance that encouragement should be given to this vital and progressive industry, and I therefore write to give you further information concerning some recent tests which confirm and amplify the statements made by Dr. Smith, and in the article entitled “British Optical Instruments’’ which appeared in The Times of January 22nd, 1931. The Admiralty have recently conducted an exhaustive series of tests, both in the laboratory and at sea, of a number of specimens of improved prismatic binoculars manufactured by the leading British makers, and have compared these binoculars with the finest foreign glasses which are obtainable. Both the laboratory tests and those made by naval officers under Service conditions showed the definite superiority of the British glasses over the foreign ones, and figures showing the amount of light lost within the instruments owing to differences in design and the quality of the glass were striking. In the best British binoculars 69 per cent, of the light entering the glass reached the eye, while the best foreign glass allowed only 59 per cent, to pass through.4 During the last few months I have also received reports on the performance of a 45° prismatic astrolabe which was designed at the Admiralty Research Laboratory for the very accurate deter mination of latitude and longitude on shore. The instrument was manufactured in England, and has been used by the Hydro- graphic Department with marked success for two or three years. In two instances the positions determined by its use disagree with those previously found by other survey departments, and as it was impossible to reconcile the discrepancies, one of these astrolabes was sent in September last to Greenwich Observatory in order that the probable error to be expected in the results of one night’s observation might be determined. This test showed clearly the remarkable precision of the new astrolabe. On five nights two naval officers used the instrument to determine the latitude and longitude of a spot in the Observatory grounds. The true position of this spot was known with great accuracy by direct measurement from the transit circle. The following are the mean positions determined as a result of the five nights’ work by the two officers :— Lat. N. Long :• e. True position 51° 28' 35.74' 0° O' 2.37' Officer A .... 51° 28' 35.80' 0° 0' 2.22' Officer B .... 51° 28' 35.63' 0° 0' 1.82' probable errors ” of the means were :— Lat. Long. Officer A .... 0.09' 0.23' Officer B .... 0.17' 0.28' To emphasize the accuracy of the foregoing results, and therefore of the astrolabe in the hands of good observers, it may be added that an error of 1 sec. of arc represents an error of only about 100ft. on the surface of the earth. I hope that these remarks of mine may add something to those of my predecessor, and may help to inspire that confidence in the enterprise and skill of British manufacturers and designers which is their due. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, C. V. DRYSDALE, Director of Scientific Research, Admiralty. Department of Scientific Research and Experiment, Admiralty, S.W.l.{Reprinted from ' The Times ” Leading Articles). 5 BRITISH OPTICAL GLASS IS BEST In 1925, in a letter published in our columns the then Director of Scientific Research at the Admiralty bore witness to the excellence of British optical glass and instruments ; and his declaration that they were inferior to none was endorsed by authorities competent to speak on behalf of the War Office and the Air Ministry. To-day his successor is able to go farther and to assert, on the basis of exhaustive tests carried out by the Admiralty both in the laboratory and under Service conditions, that the instruments of at least one type—prismatic binoculars—produced by British makers are definitely superior to the finest foreign glasses obtain able. As the Admiralty are the largest users in the world of high- grade optical glass and instruments, and their requirements are of the most exacting character, this testimony should be con vincing of itself ; but other evidence is not lacking of the progress made by the British industry since its renascence, which may truly be said to date from the War. It is stated, for example, that even in the United States the majority of cinema films are made, and also projected on the screen, with the aid of lenses of British design made in this country, while in surveying instruments, special forms of microscopes, and optical apparatus for scientific research British makers stand in the forefront. This statement applies both to the instruments and to the glass, which is a vital element in their construction. Yet, in spite of the proved precision and efficiency of British products, it is to be feared that the glamour of certain foreign names still persists and leads people who want the best to think they can get it only by purchasing instruments of foreign manufacture. It is no disparagement of the merits of foreign apparatus to say that on the evidence now available they are entirely mistaken in holding this view. Self-interest and patriot ism alike dictate that they should “buy British,” and purchasers of lower-grade apparatus, such as ordinary cameras, microscopes, and even spectacles, should do the same, remembering that the industry cannot live and thrive on cake alone, but needs also bread and butter. By buying its products and thus providing it with a home market they will help it to build up its export trade and will furnish it with funds for development and research, without which it cannot hope to maintain, still less improve, its hard-won position against competition from abroad.6 ELOQUENT TESTIMONIALS A letter from a well-known dealer : Messrs.

Dear Mr. Very many thanks for the beautiful set of glasses you sent me for selection. y The Ross is an exquisite glass, a magnificent field, definition excellent to extreme edge of the field, achromatism very good focussing very easy with second finger of one hand—wonderfully compact and stereoscopic. I must have it—blow the expense— u is a credit to English Optical trade. Yours sincerely. (Signed) Another appreciation — Messrs. Ross Ltd. Dear Sirs, You supplied me in September with a stalking telescope which 1 have been using lately when chamois stalking in Austria 1 have pleasure to say that this instrument has proved very useful for tms purpose. It was used for distances mostly up to 400 yards and gave a good image under all conditions of lighting. Its weight is rather an advantage as it is so much steadier. Though it is more expensive than the telescope made in Germany it is a good deal more useful.

In this latest series of glasses the extraordinary wide field of 70° has been attained, enabling one to observe a much larger area and to locate and follow objects with the greatest ease. The E.W.F. x 6 model is the Sportsman’s glass par excellence, and no finer binoculars have been offered to the public than this model and those described on the seven following pages.

The production of these glasses has been made possible by means of special prisms and a new type of eyepiece. In addition to a much wider field of view they have great light trans mitting power, giving a most brilliant and perfectly defined image. In this model all the advantages of the Extra Wide Field, unique quality of illumination and definition, are com bined with facilities for focussing by screw adjustment with no increase of weight.

The light transmitting power is very greatly in excess of that of any prism binocular previously made, and by reason of large prisms and lenses and eyepieces of special design, the illumination at margins of field is 137 per cent, greater than that obtained with other binoculars of the same power and aperture. Further, the central illumination is fully 20 per cent, greater and the perfect definition is maintained over practically the whole field, whereas in other types of binoculars the definition falls off rapidly towards the margins of field. These qualities of great luminosity and critical definition at margins of field make this binocular unsur passable for the use of officers of the Navy and Mercantile Marine, Yachtsmen, Huntsmen, Sportsmen, Surveyors and others.

Its introduction aroused considerable interest and it was much sought after by binocular users of all classes. Having a relatively high magnification the attainment of a field of view of 70° was no mean achievement. As will be seen from pages 18 and 19, the real field of view is practically the same as that obtained with a usual x6 binocular.

Price, adapted to Prism Binoculars .... 25/- Graticules, divided to special design 50/- 2122 ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPE OBJECTIVES FOR VISUAL OBSERVATION The telescope objectives for visual observation are ol two distinct types, apertures from 3 in. to 8 in. Type A consists of a two-lens system with a small air space separating the two lenses. Type B consists of a three-lens system with small air spaces separating the three lenses one from the other. Type A is fully corrected for chromatic and spherical aberrations and also fulfils the sine condition, thus ensuring the largest possible flat field. The inevitable secondary spectrum inherent to this type of objective is due to the images formed by the various colours of the spectrum not being in the same place along the axis. Images which are formed by monochromatic green light, for example, lie appreciably closer to the objective than images formed by monochromatic blue or red light. The amount of this deviation in terms of I /1000th part of the focal length, gives a measure of the colour correction of the objective. The chart has been prepared to show the amount of this deviation in respect of the focus for the green mercury line e. The fully drawn out curve represents the typical colour correction for the Type A objective. The abscissae are the deviations in l/1000th part of the focus, and are figured accordingly. The amount of spherical aberration in this type does not exceed l/1000th23 part of the focal length, and is negligible in comparison to the magnitude of the colour aberration. The aperture ratio of the Type A objective is //15, i.e., the focus equals 15 times the diameter of the objective. Objectives with different aperture ratios can be supplied, and also objectives specially corrected for photography. Type B follows very closely to the specification of Type A objective, in respect of its correction for spherical aberra tion and sine condition, also aperture ratio ; but differs in the most vital item, namely, the colour correction. By the selection of special glasses, and the addition of a third lens it has been possible to reduce the colour aberration to less than one quarter of the amount present in the Type A objective. The dotted line in the chart shows the colour correction for the Type B objective, and its magnitude. I hese objectives are superior in defining power to the Type A, as the images are almost colourless and much brighter owing to the larger number of rays of different colour coming to the same focus. Objectives of this type can be used without alteration for visual or photographic purposes on the same mounting. They can be made of different aperture ratios. TYPE A.

A sliding hood over object glass serves as sun or rain shade. The tripod stand and head are of new design, and an entire departure from the usual cumbersome type. The ash tripod, with brass fittings, is very rigid. The head is of aluminium alloy, with brass socket fitting for telescope. To erect the stand, open out the legs, hold the tripod head either with the longer or shorter end of supporting socket pointing upwards, according to the height required by the observer. Now press the upper ends of each leg together, and, holding leg horizontally, place rounded tops into the curved recesses in lugs of tripod head. The pins are now in such a position that, on the pressure being released, they will spring into their respective holes, and, on the leg being lowered, the projecting lugs of head securely hold them in place.29 A metal Table Stand can be supplied in place of, or in addition to, ordinary tripod stand. This Telescope is also made in binocular form, “ Tritelbin.” Both are very portable and can be carried about packed with stand in light fibre case.

T HE mount is a gun-finished drawn steel tube accurately turned and bored to take the two sliding internal fittings, and is provided with three knurled drums for adjusting range, power and focussing. The tube is parallel to allow of the usual clamping fittings to gun barrel. 1 he optical system is of entirely novel design. The lenses are of the finest optical glasses obtainable, accurately worked to special formulae. The objective is an achromatic doublet and the eye piece consists of two achromatic doublets. The erecting system has the minimum number of reflecting surfaces and consists of a triple cemented lens, this being a distinct advantage over the usual 2 doublet lens type with four reflections. Between the graticule and the object glass an achromatic deviating prism is fitted which provides a most accurate method of range adjustment. In the opinion of the leading experts, for Deerstalking and general use, the magnifying power should not exceed three diameters. If the power is much higher, definition is lost and objects are hard to find in mists, etc. If magnification is much lower there is hardly enough power for precision in a long shot. In the new Ross Sight a variable magni fication is provided of from If to 4 diameters to suit the varying light conditions in all parts of the World. The graticule is mounted a fixed distance from the object glass so as to give the best focus at a range of approximately 200 yards, thus ensuring for all practical purposes perfect definition at any range greater than about 30 yards. The object glass cell is extended to form a sun or rain shade, and if desired a rubber eyecap can be fitted over eyepiece. Variable Power Rifle Sight, 1J to 4 diameters. Power. Field of View.

Dear Sir Rupert, With reference to your letter No.335/11/60 of the 27th November, I am sending you the only .303 rifle I have. I am a bit doubtful as to whether it is really 'suitable-for presentation' as either the Bahrain water or the slow stain of time has given it rather a battered appearance; but it is a good rifle, I think, of the long 'Snipers” variety. It is too heavy for a bedouin and the Shaikh or next donee will undoubtedly cut it and mount silver on it. 2. On the general question of the presentation of •303s, I am very doubtful indeed, though I do not urge this as a reason for not making a presentation in this par ticular case. I wrote to the Residency a few days ago giving Stobart's report that some of the Shaikhs are actually giving rifles to rotbers in order to buy them o^ their own territory and subjects; and asking that a consignment of rifles for the Shaikh of Dubai should be held up. I think it would be better if^your presentation rifles were not .303. Yours sincerely His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. /gqvt.peq;^,~-y ^ ^ 1.
