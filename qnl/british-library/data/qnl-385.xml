The 'al-Nas 11 newspaper of Basra added some other demands made 'by Kuwaitis of His Highness the Emir, and which we publish 'below: - 1. The establishment of two Courts, one Legal and the other an Appeal Court, in which the Laws and Rules are to be complete, and restraint put upon those who punish the nationals and execute judgements as they wish upon them. The election of two other members in each Court, and proper Registers should be kept, to which a reference could be made when necessary. Judgements, before execution, siiould be subjected to examination in such a way that no injustice being done. 2. The establishment of a 'Security Department' like the Police stations in Iraq., gnd its members to be distinguished by special badges, and responsible for general supervision and town security work. 3. The proper administration of the Customs revenues. A committee should be appointed tojwiiiig&amp;ib l ^ appointed to supervise the work of the sulD-offices The present •loose* administration should be stopped. The appointment of a Minister or Director G-eneral of finance to supervise all transactions. 4. The establishment of a Committee of Counsellors (Majlis Shui^a), to which all the affairs of the country should 'be referred, as also the International affairs which directly affect the interests of the country, and an office to he established for the exclusive work of the Committee. 5. The establishment of a Passport and Residence Office which is to be in close touch with the 'Security Department % and the authority for issuing the visas by the British Consul at Basra should be removed. The refusal by the British Consulate of Basra for issuing visas to the Arabs men (Notable Arabs) brings a bad fame upon Kuwait, while Kuwait does not acknowledge any foreign interference in her internal or external affairs. 6. The assistance in financial and educational matters, is to be sought from the Iraq. G-ovemment, and to follow the steps in parallel line with the Arabs 1 ,t Eise w in respect of the customs and laws. 7. Negotiations are to be taken up with the neighbouring Arab Governments for conclusion of Treaties of Alliance - Offensive - defensive, which would possibly reveal any foreign Government's intentions who want the troubles to befall Kuwait.8. Tiie confinemerit of work and employments to tlie Kuwaitis, who wiien not caa?al)le, and Iraq.i Arabs to 'be preferred to the Indians, Armenians and other foreigners. 9 • The allotment of a sum in the Budget for despatching the missions ateoad to study the mechanic and other courses to 'be prepared for work in the Oil Department. 10.

'e wrote repeatedly a'bout the taxes, amounting to many thousands of Dinars, which are due to G-ovt, against the estates of the toir of Kuwait. These taxes are due from his properties in Basra, from time to time he has 'been evading payment oy giving fawse promises to pay, hile the amount is increasing yearly 'by thousands of Dinars. It was the duty of previous Govts, not to have allowed the Amir any more opportunities for payment than the many that were ~ already given to him to settle his deht. The Amir of Kuwait has no any good intentions towards Iraa and the Iraq.is, and we heleive that 'by evading payment he is trying to gain time for denying this right 'by means of the passage of time, therefore, we hope that Govt, will not allow him any more time. His estates are situate at .asra and Govt, has only to attach them against recovery of the great amount due, and we think: that their value will 'be insufficeint to meet the amount which has accumolated for many years, Te read from time to time that the Amir of Kuwait does not lies! bate in taking any opportunity , which might present itself, to harm the interests of Iraa. Elsewhere (in this issue) there are examples which give support to our assertions, therefore, we see no reason why Govt, should not collect the accumolated taxes from him, which is a clear right of the Treasury.

HIS PIAIN EIGHT The Amir of Kuwait has given concession to a certain Company to prospect for oil, T'ahich was found in rich wells all over a large tract of land. The Company took advantage of this, relying on the word of the Amir that the- 2 - '7 ^ the land was his. But, lately it was found- that the land 'belongs to Shaikh Kasim Al-rbrahim, andt important iraq_i merchant residing in India for a long time, who has forwarded an appeal to the G-ovt of India for possession of these lands which 'belong to him, and he has also sent an appeal to the proper authorities in Iraq., asking for G -OTt• mediation in the matter. He is intent on filing a suit against the Amir for giving the concession to the Company over lands which do not 'belong to him, and he will demand a vast compensation. Ee supports his case 'by official documents which prove his allegations. When the Amir of Kuwait realised that he would lose this great contract, he asked the Company to approach Shaikh Kasim and offer him compensation, equal to the value of the lands, on condition that he gives up his rights to him. But we understand that Shaikh Kasim is determined to proceed with his case till the end, 'because his right is clear, and that he wishes to put the land under the control of the Iraq G-ovt., and that he has engaged famous British and Iraqi lawyers for the purpose. 7e have also heard from many legal authorities that the rignts of the claimant are clear and that it is certain that he will get his rights in full. 7fe also understand that the Iraqi Consulate G-eneral at Bombay has asked the G-ovt at Baghdad to take up the matter in earnest so that the Iraqi's clear rights may not 'be lost, TEE' Aim 0? yWAIT AITD IRA.Q.I The paper goes on to say that the Amir has forbidden the engagement of any Iraqi workmen in the Kuwait Oil Co. and that the Company cannot do without them, and as he was obstinate they had to put the matter 'before the Political Agent whose orders the Amir does not hesitate to ohey as he is indebted to the British for his existance and position, and he always keeps an autographed picture of His Late Majesty King G-eorge T under Kis Majesty's own signature. The paper expects that anyhow the Amir will come down to real facts and advises him not to go too far- 3 - too far in his actions of harming the interests of Iraq., as he has his own many interests there which may 'be harmed in return.

The follow-ing has 'been received from our Pasra correspondent: - The Basra Police -are taking the necessary meas ures for the prevention of smuggling, which is usually from Kuwait, 'by increasing the fronteir guard to watch all along the Kuwait fronteir. The Amir of Kuwait shows an unconcerned attitude and it is the duty of Govt, to put an end to his unfreindly actions. By writing these we are not medling in the internal affairs of Kuwait or the affairs of ner Amir, hut we are writing aoout the common harm which is 'being done to our Customs and Revenues, and eventually to our Budget, the cheif source of vhich is through the Customs. He are well awre that the Amir does not do anything to stop this harm which is 'being done to us through Kuwait, and this supports the general heleif that he is in full sympathy with smuggling, or that he ignores it, TTe shall return to the subject and we, however, hope that the Amir of Kuwait will cane to his senses and will realise that such actions are against the rules and good neighbourliness.3^ P.Z.3548/38 ilb BUSH IRE RESIDENCY, No *&lt;?/.

In paragraph 4 of his letter i-lo. 0/131 Captain de G-aury reported that several persons in panic had left Kuwait for Iraq, and I imagined that the Iraqi Press, which as you know takes every opportunity of attacking Kuwait, would have taken this opportunity of a fresh onslaught. They could have attacked the Shaikh of Kuwait as a brutal and high-handed [ Dictator suppressing a popular movement, and - what would j have affected us - could have represented him being supported, either actively or tacitly, by K.M.G. , under whose protection he is. If such articles had appeared they would probably have been copied by the rest of the Arab Press further afield, and the European Press, or rather sections of it, e.g., the Italian, might have taken it up. Before our present detente with Italy the . incident would have been welcomed by the Bar! Broadcast. 1 therefore asked Captain de Gaury to t6lograph to Mr.'Veightman, repeating to India Office and Government i of India any repercussions that might ensue in the Iraqi Press. He has not telegraphed and so I assume that, contrary to my expectation, the Iraqi Press has not taken advantage of the incident - why I don't know. Kor has he/ i2. he reported further on the incident itself, so I assume that all is quiet. 4. i suggest however that a telegram be sent to isir ♦ v.' e ightrnan i repeated to Captain de jaury, copy by air mail to Government of India, referring to my express ^letter I-jo .149 of 22nd Liarch, and asking (a) whether any P . articles on the incident have appeared in the Iraqi Press (b) how does the situation now stand. When we receive a reply we can consider what action, if any, is required by His Majesty's Government.^ 5 I c - ^ ^ - ^ BU6!' :: nz nr.' 1 zv. t&amp;..3~M.ii&amp;... \Political Agency,^ DatQ.J.?.:.f~'$.f. j jr^.-kv.• ■ k- jmr » try, • • .-x — r. f —^ -7 « r- r- rt ^ «?■ l._L&gt;Jiii&gt;s&gt; » Pyvy S rte^l^ Kuwait♦ The 13th Jirf 1938.

Some time has elapsed since my report on the 19th March and His Highness, as I had thought not improbable, now endeavoured to pass off the movement at the time of the al Barrak incident as nothing of importance, saying that there was no popular or democratic movement in Kuwait. My suggestion he said was something new, where had such ideas come from? Such movement as there had been, had arisen frcm the activities of an Iraqi intriguer, one al Faidhi, who had come down on a boat taking away gravel for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. This man I had not heard of before, and I said I was surprised he had not mentioned to me his subversive activities. 2, As for al Barrak, the Ruler said, that he was punished as he deserved and that was that. I said that this would not do. There had been torture, and I repeated firmly what I had said before that there was to be no repetition of this kind of beating to extract information, and day after day. A definite number of strokes awarded as a punishment was a different thing to just 'beating up* 1 a prisoner for an indefinite time, which was not to occur again. His Highness had nothing more to say, and only screwed up his face - like a child about to cry. Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E.,G.B.S., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E.^3 2. The suggestion that any new democratic movement should be drawn by him into useful channels seemed to be beyond his comprehension, and I believe that it is. A movement of this kind is, in his view, to be suppressed firmly and I doubt if even a lengthy explanation would convince him of the soundness of any other policy. Such understanding as he has acquired of political forms, has, I fear, long ago ranged him on the side of dictators# I will however, from time to time, endeavour to educate him upon this subject. 4. With regard to a closer cooperation with his family and people in the adiaini strati on he said he thought his cooperation was quite close enough already, and that no alteration was desirable. As soon as Oil Royalties began to come in he would undertake the various improvements that were needed, such as a hospital and better educational facilities. I had put these two examples into his mouth, as 1 had asked him what he meant by improvements', was it such things, or did he mean a change in the shape of the administration ?. 5, He was surprisingly unemphatic in his reply about the appointment of an Adviser^ It may be that he has been expecting such an appointment, and that the various statements which have appeared in the press from his Secretary^ pen, to say that he has no Foreign Advisers, that Colonel Dickson is not his Adviser, and so on, have been merely an attempt to stave off what he has regarded as inevitable. e # In any case, he had nothing much to say about it, and only asked what the Adviser would advise about. I said the acministration of course, and anything on which His Highness might need advice. He only shrugged his shoulders, and said the Government was able to do what it wished.-2- 7. His Highness, who, at first, in his usual lively manner endeavoured to brush aside any criticism, had by the end of the interview a quieter and more reasonable air, and was more impressed than might be apparent from his replies. 8.

MONTHLY IKTELLIGiiiNCiii SUMMARY of May 1938. The Press and ruWAIT&gt; The Iraqi Press has duringthe month indulged in violent attacks on the Shaikh of Kuwait and his Governue nt. Reports that the Kuwaiti Liberals have decided to petition the Iraq Government demanding amalgamation of Iraq and Kuwait have been given great prominence, as have also accounts of bad administration in the Shaikhdom. In addition the Kuwait administration is accused of encouraging the ssaiggling of dutiable and contraband goods into Iraq, After a number of these attacks had appeared, the Private Secretary to the Shaikh of Kuwait wrote an open letter to the Iraq Press, which was published in n kz Zaman' newspaper; in this he advised the Iraq newspapers not to interfere in the internal affairs of a friendly Government andto stop trying by means of this unfriendly propaganda to s tir up the people of Kuwait against their kwful Government. This has, as yet, had no effect on the volume of propaganda against the Kuwait Government and as the Iraqi Goverm® it control the pre ss it can only be assumed that these press attacks meet with the Iraqi Goverrusmt 's approval. It seems strange, indeed, that the Iraq i Governant, who were recently so indignant at Syrian press propaganda directed against themselves, and who threatened retaliatory action if the propaganda continued, should look tth complacency on similar unwarranted and unfriendly attacks by their own press on the Kuwait administration* The Iraq press constantly refer to Kuwait as being an integral part of Basra Liwa. In this connection it is interesting to remember that during the recent debate on the Iraq - Iran Treaty in the Chamber of Deputies, one laading Deputy referred to the possibility of Kuwait being used as Iraq's outlet to the sea.I » \ CONFIDENTIAL. r 3' / No. ' ^ (X-^Lsy h &lt;4&gt; &amp; V at Basra The Political Agent at KuwaiVpresents his compliments to The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire on S♦S,^VARSOVA n and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned documentfs) for information.

Transition of an article publishe H A1 -Sejil w of 27th May 1938. 4 in the Basra weekly newspaper \'■ &gt; Dt t V Translation of an article in tiie Basra weekly newspaper 'Al-Sejil' of 27th, May, 1938. BE GECTTLE 0 EDITOR OF AL-SEJIL - In your last issue there was an articl© against - ' I the firm and erect pole of Hulership in Kuwait in which you directed bitter criticism against the innocent and heroic administration of the State. There is no doubt that this is a sin, for which it should be your duty to atone by a good act. How can it be, that Kuwait, which takes pride in her 4ws and the Rulership, is the only one amongst all Gods' own countries, which helps her strong neighbours to promote their propaganda, although they may not be of her own religion, and adverse to her interests. Here is an example to prove my assertion. There is a protestant Americam foundation, a Hospital, choked full by the sick of the Muslim Kuwaitis, who fall a prey to their continuous religiotts preachings, prayers, and verses of Church hymns. Each morning its compound is full of patients including the rich, whose wealth is extracted from them by every possible means. They are compelled, its being the only hospital in Kuwait, to come to it although it lacks proper and sufficient materials, owing to which many of the patients have passed away, a sacrifice to lack of attention. The A%rate has helped these *. Americans by allowing them to import all their materials duty free, notably religious books, and although this respectable Amirate receives Customs duty on all b00k8 :llIiported or exported from Kuwait, even the Holy Koran. Forbearance in religious matters has reached its utmost, . f and some imams and Muazzins do not come for morning prayers and no heed is given to the complaints of members of thes ... -2- J &gt; of the congregation. Amongst the good actSy upon which none has commented, of this Amirate, is its being the only one which has an admirable speciality of imposing internal Customs duties, as no one of the dwellers of the small • villages of Kuwait, such as Jahra, Fantas etc*, can take out from Kuwait City a single bag of rice or any other necessary foodstuff, without payment of one rupee, or more, per bag. The people of Kuwait look forward to the foundation of / schools with much eagerness, and they have been for the last thrity years trying to open schools and a free State Hospital, but they met with bitter opposition from Shaikh Mubarak, grandfather of the present Amir. The great toleration of the Kuwaitis has promoted them to name the Mubarakiyyah school so to please that late Amir, and the other Ahmediyyah school as a mark of encourgement and a constant reminder to the present Amir to proceed towards progress, even at a slow pacel The hope of the people for a hospital was swept away by one angry mood from H.B. Shaikh Mubarak. The present state of affairs in Kuwait does net permit anyone to instil into it a life of enlightment and activity, or the freeing of the public from ignorance and disease. Anyone who tries to do so will find that canes, whips and imprisonment in the 'shop*, which is well protected from ventilation, are ready for him. His Highness the Amir is very fond of the guitar and its strings and he always keeps very neater to him those who know how to play it. His overbearing desire, to leave all matters as they were, has promoted him to bring in Propagandists, and converts of Free Masonary, and converts of other sects Of self pleasure. As to your bewalllngs, ycu newspaper advocates of education, lovers of reforms and supporters of personal independence for Individuals, you should know ^3-3- Jaiow that there is a wide space 'between you and the demands of His Highness, our Amir the Preux Chevalier^ » * may God preserve him, and his Chief Justice of the Courts, Shaildi Atdulla al^Jabir, who penalizes anyone who does- ^ * not come to his Court. With the first messenger he sends notice, a fine for delaying, ofklfew thousands of rupjpes,&gt; ^ a matter which has necessitated some of those so penalized to flee away from Kuwait, and take refuge at Zubair. We, of the entourage, do not care in the least- about such resentful persons. Know, you poor journalist, that Kuwait is proceeding on the way which pleases the entourage of her Amir, whether it pleases or angers you, 0 supporters of those foolish Kuwaiti youths. I have some more strange and wonderful things which I shall write you about if you publish this my article. In the end X pray to Allah not to displace our present dearly beloved Amir, whose administration is quite suitable to our own personal interests, and may Allah's b^lessings be on those who stop from teasing us.

Our patience has 'been exhausted, and there remains nothing, after all the efforts which we have made to get our rights, except the defence of the soulo In Kuwait a secret society has 'been formed, for the sole purpose of defending you, which has taken an Oath 'by the name pf the Almighty God to wage a holy war for your sake, and which will never turn hack untill the Almighty wills Victory for the people and shameful failure for the traitors&lt;» This holy war will, primarily, he waged in a non-violent manner, and 'by peaceful requests to H.H. the Amir who may, perhaps, realise his mistake and 'be drawn towards your wishes for progress, and your emest desires for improvementso As H.H. has many times openly said that he has the 'best wishes and intentions for his state, we now come forward to him with this circular, so thaXhe may have no excuse, 'by making it an open proof against him, so that he may 'be held fully responsible for our holy war which may have to 'be continued for a long time. The clouds of oppression overhanging Kuwait are oppressions in Laws, in the squandering of public funds, the depriving of the Kuwaiti people from progressive measures, the employment of foreigners, who act as mounts for dictator colonists, the terrorising of the public for payment of higher revenues, and oppressions which are directed against us from all points of our existance. The society leaves aside all near and far away hye- gones to be byegones, acting in accordance with the Islamic Shari-at which says 'God has forgiven the past', and hereby the society puts down her demands as under; -under:- £~J I't is the duty of the Amir to submit, and to recognise that the Kuwaiti public have indisputeahle legal rights and will never, 'by any means, submit to a despotic policy, Z. The people want to control their own interests and finances and to spend, for their own progress and. improvements and this cannot 'be realised except 'by making laws according to which the policy of the state may he directed, and which will protect the public funds from 'being used, as play money, hy ignorant members of the entourage who know nothing else ve than the hoarding of money and driving the people to po^rty f 'by various mean ways. 3. The public want an annual grant of Bs» 50000/-, from the Oil revenues, to 'be spent for the sole purpose of town improvements, by way of an annual contribution to the Municipality, and this demand is a very reasonable one # 4. The public want the immediate foundation of a Hospital complete in every detail, with all the necessary surgical instruments and medical requirements, to be by Arab doctors, and by no means will mere promises for its foundation be accepted# 5* The public requires that all revenues derived from local products, such as Sand, Shingle and Gravel, and from tonnage and warehousing, and from all those materials which are the natural products of Kuwait, should all be spent on public welfare generally# 6. The public want the infusion of life into it materially by streching water pipes from Iraa to Kuwait, aftei making the necessary agreement with the Iraq. Govememnt, as Kuwait is faced by great dangers, because water is life, and should any of the strong powers prevent the arrival of water into Kuwait then the public will surely die of thirst and will thus be compelled to submit without a struggle#- 3 - a struggleo 7. The public want that the real germ of disease, which is firmly set in the state, 'be destroyed 'by dispersing the entourage of evil which screens the Amir from hi&lt;? people, and which does not care whether the people of Kuwait die or not as long as they themselves enjoy the squandering of public funds. The people demand their immediate dispersal without the least hesitation# 8. The public want that those responsible for promulgating evil 'between them, and those who have rohhed them of their legal rights, and those who promote the spread ing of ignorance, most of whom are tricksters with mean designs, should 'be taken to task. The people of Kuwait are not powerful or strong, and have therefore taken to giving advice and demanding their rights 'by means of circulating regular monthly circulars which will 'be circulated locally and outside the state# Every sincere well wisher does not doubt the legality of our rights, therefore the society jealously guards the honour of Kuwait and her Amir and appeals to the general public to help and join her, 'because the hand of God is with those who form themselves into a iarty, and no right will 'be lost as long as it has a claimant# THE KUWAIT SEOHST SOdSTT#iBUS!-' '' T PFf-mr.MpY J. -j— i political Agency, «w.^- - Aafc.• •. ....((' 7r.,J Kuwait• C0:*F;DZ:i7',',L RECORDS ..jm ?iie 24tii June, 1958. /^JL^ ^ Sheikh Abdulla as Salim callea again today and brought me the attached note, a copy of the original agreement made between Sheikh Ahmad and certain notables of Kuwait, whereby he had to form a council as a condition of his election as Huler. (See P.G.15, Page 75, Para 5). 2. Sheikh Abdulla said that he felt that a British a iVUiluiSiAiiCC!* adviser was essential here. He would like to see, lir.Belgrave, the adviser at Bahrein, here. Why so many of the people wanted the British here was because they saw and aomired the condition of Bahrein, and were also attached, by commercial interests and tradition to British India. 5 # He, and all the people were with us. All would be 9 well in future, if only we would give them a lead and an idea of what we wanted. He repeated that an indecisive policy 'V &gt; would be dangerous and that underground agitation was not lessening. 4. Sheikh Abdulla, I think, possibly foresees that the present agitation may turn not only against Sheikh Ahmad but against the whole Ruling family, and knowing that in Bahrein we have supported the Huling family views that form of administration favourably. 5 # It is true, that at the moment, surprising as it ' may seem, the British, in this small state, are, generally 4 speaking, popular and being looked to for a lead.

AL KAEKH (COLLOQUIAL MP GBITIGAL) 20.5«1938» ABOUT THE AMUOUHCEMlOT OF THE AT.T.TOTRD HKfTRliiTABY OF THE AMIR . The Al-Sijil paper of Basra had sail in its reply to the aimouncement 'by the alleged secretary, in order to refute the news published 'by Iraqi newspapers about Kuwait, ought to have coupled the armouncement with statics showing the number ( of hospitals, schools, first releif institutions, libraries, Courts of Justice and technical institutes (as he did with the Bari 'broadcasting Station ishich was inspired 'by him, and in which he painted Kuwait as a psradise of men) so that the Iraqi papers may 'be convinced of the progress that is 'being made 'by this nieghbouring province• The falsification of which the secretary complained were the only weapons he himself used in his explanations* Readers may think that on Iraa and Kuwait are/very friendly terms, but has Kuwait, or rather its authorities, left any means unused to enstrange this country and harm it in every respect • Have the smuggling events left any tie between the two countries unbroken, or has the expulsion of Iraqi workmen from Kuwait preserved any sympathy with Kuwait, or has the Kuwaiti authorities refusal of the employment of Iraqiis and the holding back of the Iraqi farmers dues in Basra date gardens helped preserving friend ship between the two countries ?• These are some of the peiaa points which have caused Iraq, so much loss and inconvenience through the behaviour of the Kuwait author!tes, let alone the loss of many lifes on both sides on account of the smuggling activities of Kuwaitis or Iraqis using Kuwait as the starting point..., Kuwait is, in point of fact, an Iraqi district, and to leave it grope in the darkness of ignorance and mis administration, would pain the heart of every Arab to ^ay nothing of Iraqis who regard it as part of their own country. As another example of the injustice done to the Arabs of Kuwait, Al-sijil paper asserts that recently a car driven by a Kuwaiti and another driven by a Somali British Subject collided. Both drivers were arrested, but through the intervention of the British Consul in Kuwait the Somali was- 2 - the Somali was 7 released and the Kuwaiti has ever since 'been kept locked up. This created a very 'bad impression among Kuwaitis some ot whom are thinking of approaching the Shaikh for the release of the Kuwaiti driver as well in order to put an end to unnecessary gossip and to save the reputation of the principality. Al-Sijil learns also that since the Kuwait authori- — ^ W f|| . rr ,, , | | ^ ties employed a Iree Mason in their offices he has 'been finding nanj r customers for an. Egyptian Masonic paper, and through his efforts manor Kuwaitis are sutscrlhlng In that paper, while nationalist and Muslim papers are totally 'banned. It only remains for the Shaikh of Kuwait to supress the liberties of his people and force them to read only Masonic or Missionary papers to the complete exculslon of Islamic and Arah nationalist papers. His latest orders have heen given to prevent the Al-Sljll newspaper of Basra from entering Kuwait In retaliation for what It has 'been writing about the ^anmr.fis of the Intelllgenzla of Kuwait. The Amir of Kuwait Must know fully well that complaints and grievances against him In his principality are growing daily and that the Iraq,! press is determined to reiterate such grelvances untill he has 'been compelled to carry out the demands of Kuwaiti nationalist elements. 27.5.1958 THE SITUATTOW TW TCOTAIT.

It makes for Kuwait an important occasion, and I ought perhaps to record, with some details, the immediately preceding incidents and the event. On the morning of 23th June, as I have already reported, three of the leading merchants of Kuwait who y+ ■■■' *• ^ '■ had behind them a very large following, requested the Sheikh to agree to the formation of a Council. This he S^.. did and agreed to their conducting an election, upon which they insisted, knowing that nominations to a Council would be made by him from among his immediate entourage, and not from his family and the Notables. 3. The same night there gathered the heads of the 150 leading families of Kuwait, and they elected from among ^ w ^ v »■ . • •■■■ - «• ■ niniinnnrii nnwi umimiiimnmn, 11,^ . &lt;T'i'ir, • —ffrTf themselves 14 persons, whose nemes I have given in an Appendix to this letter, to be members of the Council. It was known that if sucn &amp; Council was formed and attained power, its demands, an outline of wmcu I give in another Appendix to tnis letter, would include a7/ 'cleaning up* in the entourage of the Ruler. 4, Thus a clique, hardly to be called a party, was formed fraa the Sheiidi , s Secretaries* , the Director of the J -'- ' r ''^ ■ Municipality, and one merchant called Khalid Zaid, which .. ,, ... . • - ■ ..A v ■• ■•;■ ^.... &gt;• xaade desperate efforts to win followers. - ^uite large sums of money, and various priTileges, were offered to any one who would default from the Council. Even the Persians and the poor were summoned to join the Secretaries* party, but even they refused. The activities of the clique, soon seem to be futile, were bringing more and more odium on to them, and on to the Sheilch who was inevitably coming to be identified with them in the public mind. 5 # There was, consequently, considerable political « activity, but judging that it would not come to a headfor « a day or two, I thought it would be wise to avoid it all, and I therefore left by sea, for a tour on the Northern frontier, tliera to Investigate some Incursions by Iraqi f ,- -— ^ policemen. On my rettarn it was obrious that matters were fast coming to a crisis. Sither the sheikh: would hare to give way in the v v ., ,,,. ...... next few hours, or he would find himself isolated. q 9 On the morning of the 4th the notables and the Ruling family, and those who were in opposition to the Council, iaoludlng Khalid az Zaid, ass^ibled in the Sheilch , i Diwan for the usual morning coffee-drinking, but witli every intention to come to a definite conclusion before they left. y^ 'jhe members of the Council demanded His Highness* formal approval in writing, of a Gouncil, which verbally he had sanctioned, but it now seemed had secretly tried to undermine. They spoke of his being misled by a few persons7 2- with prlvat© ambitions, against the wishes of the majority of his oountrymen and against the interest of his family, which he neglected in favour of a few ignoble cronies* 8 # His Highness asked them what would be the outcome if he withheld his approval?. .. ^-.aw w^afaaiiagSSaSi^' w In that oase ,, said one of the leaders rising to his feet, and others with him, ^we bid you farewell^. His Highness quickly denied that he intended to disapprove# 9 # In faet, their tramp card, had he done so, was ready, in the foiaa^of a petition, to be signed by all the notable^ and presented at this Agenoy, asking for direct Vj..'', a!W | !» n 'MW»^TO»WWWWW^ British Rulev a denouement which might have made piquant news in Baghdad* 10. His Highness then pretended to be, or was, persuaded of the worthlessness of Khalid az Zald and his clique, and turning upon them, publicly denied him and his followers Tto were immediately jostled from the Hall, and down the stairway, into the inimical crowd outside* His motor car had already been burnt. gmae** XX, Thus ignominiously ended, the attempt of' the Sheikh*s entourage to scuttle the Council before it was fully launched* &gt;; 12. His Highness however managed to retain a &gt; semblance of his Ruler's control by postponing his signature of approval of the Council until the following day, the 5th. X3, It seemed that he still had hopes, bred no doubt by his Secretaries' advice, of being able, if only he could gain time, to break up the solidarity of the Council, and on the morning of the 5th he spent only a brief period in the4— public rooms of his Palace, on the excuse of being ill. When I saw him he complained that his head was going round from so much work, and said that he hoped to alter the Council, although he had approved it in principle. 14 # in the evening he ordered the release from prison of Mohammed al Barrak, the man so badly beaten last March. 15, About the same time I beard that the Secretaries' party was, as a last throw, giving It out that the Gouncil was a result of foreign intrigue and anti-religious# This was no more successful than their former eff ort, and on the morning of the 6th His Highness at last signed his approval of the Council in principle, and its present members. 1^. Tactfully the people of Kuweit have already submitted to His Highness, a many-signed letter of thanks for his approval of the Council. 17 # The advent in the last day or two of the enervating very hot weather, is perhaps forirunate, and I nave hopes that the recent political agitation, which grew up through the Sheikh's obstinacy, will now die «w»r» and the Council settle down to useful work, under a chastened Sheikh. 19. on the whol. I fe.l th«t matters have tximed out fortunately for us. As your auvloe to the Sheikh to form a Council was known, the Council and the people feel at one with uSf and grateful to you. Had formation of the Council been postponed, and not advocated by you, feeling without any doubt, would have grown, and grown rapidly, until ht last there had came a serious flare-up, in which, I think*, r it is quite possible that the Sheikh would hare lost his life. Before that point had been reached the agitators would have beccae deeply involved in Iraq, where they would have been offered, advice and hope*Itf. -5- 19. As it is, while there are no doubt still difficulties to be faced, and a small rightly nominated Council might have been preferred, at least the change in the form of local government has, I am happy to say, occurred without the firing of a shot, or even the sending of a telegram 20. The Council is composed of experienced men, ustab i -~ — - ^-ibui, - a * tow ■ ■ ■■• -'wwww to weighing commercial enterprises, and conducting the affairs of their large families, and the messages I have already received from them, make me believe that the result of their deliberations, if they obtain a decree of fiscal power, will lead to the administration of the territory on more efficient *■— lines* 'nJ 21.

The electors were the entire assembly of Kuwait notables, about 150 persons, who voted publicly on the night of the 29th June 1938, the Shaikh having agreed to accept a council on the same morning.78 AD:.:iins?R&gt;. .TON OF nr.^rr . G eneral&gt; As will be seon belov; the 'uwait adrainistratlon costs the present Ruler very little. He has been able to buy large estates in ISgypt, and place considerable sums x to his private credit, without hindrance from his family or his people. In spite of this it is frequently and rightly commented upon by visitors that the people on the whole seem happier in Jluviai t than in any of the surrounding countries. Open criticism of the Ruler and the administration, although growing, has been confined to certain of his notables, articles in the Ira. i newspapers, and recently some broad-sheets distributed secretly. The Ruler is never tired of pointing at the administration of his neighbours, either to Ira,-, v; lie re behind a facade of westernization, there is much unpleasant and best hid, or in Saudi Arabia, where punishiients such as that reported in His La jo sty *3 Minister^ Summary of Jvents for February, jara 48, and the cutting off of the right hand for theft of goods ~'orth more than £5, are not uncoramon, and where slave- trading, i spite of Anti-slavery Regulations, is I I reported to continue. Nothing puts the Ruler in a gayer I mood than tales of the simplicity, and 'Savagery' as he calls it, of the Ttucial Coast Lhaikhdoms. It is only f-ir to the Ruler to touch very briefly upon such things before beginning to describe the rluwai t administration, in which shertcomings will be readily apparent. So The most remarkable feature of the administration is tbftt oae of the Shaihh's cousins, also his son-in-law, ! -^•i-- n al-J-oir, perr^a.nan'i Presi dent of the —cipaii ^ , magistrate, chief o Police, Director-_ o _ / Direotor-^ener.. 1 of 'Jduc... acu, and Colleotor of Land Cus torus , and in f l o t is t ^e one in. n adidnistrt tor of •• i^ town, u.d therefore for practical purposes of !: .'..it in ^eneri-.l* 7orl:ing closely v/itri this '.a. inic tr^ tor is tlie ,jliaikli T s now elderly Secretary, (and Ms son), and the Director of the !■ lunicipdIty. .iocordin, to i ny people these tba:-ee fend off petitions ' ''--ler, nisrevresent to lila private aims and public o- ini n, s id combine d, control the State, to their adv. .ntace, r ' r .i:, is possible bee ur e the ^uler, althouph vife I. ,,15, : c.pe 1Z ,-ara 3, he cane to the lu'er ship on the understanding that he consulted a Council, io r nr t do so.

The Ruler was paid Rs.475,000 (£.35,625) by the Kuwait Oil Company for the grant of their concession in 1935. 4. Even allowing for peculation and errors in estimates, it seems that the annual saving to the Ruler's pocket must be about £.40,000, but it is believed that the higher figure, \ £.50,397, is nearer the mark. On the other hand with a better administration the receipts to the State would be higher* 6. That almost the whole of the State T s Income should go to the Rulers personal account is of course a grievance^(3) JUSTICE HT igi w-vIT , General» The sect of the ruling family and the majority of Kuvsaitis is Hanbali, and the precepts of that seot therefore predominate in Kuwait Justice. 2. cases of all kinds, except petty complaints, are first heard by Shaikh Abdulla al-Jabir, the Deputy of the Shaikh and town administrator, who gives his decision after hearing both parties, often without making any written records of the complaint, defence and evidence. If however the case is of a complicated nature, with a religious aspect, he refers it to the Qazi of the 8hari T at Court, either Sunni or Shi T ah, who decides it 0 If the case has a commercial or maritime aspect he refers it to a committee of merchants or sea captains who after hearing both parties send an oral summary of their views to Shaikh Abdulla who gives his decision accordingly. Arbitration is also resorted to by other guilds-men. P^TTY CixS^S . 3. petty cases are brought before Shaikh Subah, Chief of the Nigjtit Guards, who usually deals with them by confiscating furniture or other property. It Is said that he takes the proceeds for himself without having to give an account to any one. CIVIL CODS . 4. In practice there is also a form of Civil Code. To take an example, by the Shaikh's order drivers in Kuwait drive their cars on the left of the road. If one were to be found driving on the ri^it he could be fined or imprisoned, although no written code to cover the case exists, except perhaps the original public notice in the main square, probably long ago lost or destroyed. COURTS . 5. There are therefore the following oourts:-There are therefore the following Courts:- (a) The Magistrate^ (the Deputy of the Shaikh and town Administrator.) (b) The qazis* (Sunni and Shi*ah) (c) The Merchants 1 ,Arbitration Court. (d) The sea Captains T Arbitration Court. (e) The Minor cases Court, under a member of the Shaikhs family. There is no tribal Court and most oases are settled by an Arbitrator, in the tents, in the traditional manner, and by the laws of common Bedouin usage. The following is a note by a Kuwaiti . 6. Since the inauguration of the Court, about 8 or 9 years ago, Shaikh Abdulla al-Jabir, the Magistrate, has slowly but surely drifted away from the original system. He has formed a kind of association for corruption in justice, consisting of himself. His Highness T Secretary, the Sunni C^azi, the Director of the Municipality and a certain All al-Mas f ad, a Court messenger and policeman. Corruption in justice is a chief cause of public resentment against the present administration, as almost every member of the public, In some way or another, is effected. Those who have not been directly effected themselves are in sympathy with some friends or near relatives who have been unjustly dealt with. The most open and shameless aspect of Justice, or rather injustice, in Kuwait is that Shaikh Abdulla, or the Qazis, will give a certain decision in a certain case one day, and will give a reverse decision in another but exactly similar case the next daji, always having one side of the scales heavily down in favour of the party which paid a price, or rather the party which pays higher. Shaikh Abdulla and his associates receive all-a- receive all the proceeds of fines and penalties imposed As a single example, out of the many hundreds which could be quoted, I give ^he ce.se of Ahmed bin Farhan, a notable pearl merchant of Kuwait, who was involved in a civil suit about two years ago. Shaikh ^bdulla sent a messenger to ask him to come to court, and Ahmed, as he Wc s engaged at that itoment , told the messenger the b he would come a little later. when Shaikh Abdulla received the reply he immediately went hi ..self to the rx n and put his ,? ohumak ?t around his neck and lashed him very severely and ordered him to pay a fine of ts o 5 j00/-, which was later reduced, tlirou h the request of other notables, to Rs . 2000/-, rhr Man paid the fine and moved with his ft ml ly to Zub-ir, cursing ::u'aitand its Justice. 7. It vould appetr desirable for the Ruler of such a siii.. 11 state to take an active part in the administration of justice himself, and It is a grievance that Im does not do so. If he, with two elders of his family, formed an sppeal Court, it should Vave a beneficial effect. Until about 1935 it was the habit of the Ruler of ;;uv.ait to take an active part in the ad dnis tration of justice, ana the Ruler sat daily for a short time, in a public place, when petitioners, yao might have been prevented from approaching him, or obtaining justice otherwise, could come to him with their plaint.(c) G-enerc.1 .

In one of these there are employed four Palestinian school roaster (approved as suitable by the Secretariat of the High Coimaissioner in Palestine, before being appointed in 1937.) v/ho teach English and more advanced work than the local school masters. In addition a number of paid teachers of English, Indians and others, spread the knowledge of that language® 3o The education of the poorer school boys in the Koranic schools is paid, by ancient Nejdi Arab custom, in the following way. On passing out, the graduate, cloaked ana wearing a man's sword for the first time, accompanied oy his feIlows parades outside the houses of all the notables in turn, and chants with his partr^ until the owner sendabut a subscription.

Some time ago, the Agency asked the General Superintendent of the Oil Company to gi^e the Ruler a forecast of his requirements in employees, which he did on Hay 1938, but accompanied it by a letter, an extract of which fo 1 lows :- ' a At present there seems to be little at tempt being made by the youngmen of the tan to ^obtain the necessary training, which in most cases ^necessitates going abroad for a time to some place ^/here they can get it*,........ I append a list ?t of the various types of Jobs in which vacancies '♦may reasonably be expected. Training in the more 'skilled of these will take as much as five years. 'It is essential if the Kuwaitis are to take a 'full part in the skil3_ed and technical jobs of the 'Compaq?-, that fathers send their sons away and 'get them trained.' 6. The State,should, I think, now select a limited number of boys from the three higher grade schools, and send them for continuation of their education abroad, to be followed, when they are up to a suitable standard,-li- S8 standard, by technical training, for employment known as likely to occur e»g. with the Oil Company, in W/T, Medical works etcetera. That no State effort is being made to meet the requirements of the future is a grievance. His Highness for the last three years has occasionally lulled criticism 'by speaking of what he is going to do in this way.

ACTr /TTiOS . police. The Municipality was established in 1930 by the present Ruler, who placed some of his guards at its disposal. Bui 1 di ng Impr ov eme n ts. Improvements in Kuwait town have been made eog. narrow streets, which were before unsuitable for car traffic, have been widened. A long bazaar, crossing the town from the sea to the central market square was widened about three years ago, and the success of these improvements has induced the Municipality to re-condition other parts of the bazaar.» A simple new fish market and a simple abattoir on the sea have been made recently. Other improvements are required in when money is available.Fire, Anti-Fire precaustions are confined to three stands of dry buckets in the market places. How little interest the Ruler talces in the Municipal administration will be deduced from the fact that in July 1938 he had not yet visited the new fish market made in the autumn of 19o7« 3. Direction of the Municipality . The Municipality has 11 unpaid members, a permanent president and a Director. 'The members and the Director are to be elected every two years by a limited number of the people, whose names are kept in a special register maintained only for the election. According to a well informed Kuwaiti the procedure of the election is as follows:- 'The permanent president. Shaikh Abdul la al-Jabir, the Town Administrator, cousin and son-in -law of the present Ruler, issues letters to the electorate, who send their replies on the day of election to three old and distinguished merchants, who are staunch supporters of the presidents These with the Director of the Municipality open the ballot box and read out the letters, and give their decision as to the nanBs of those elected. If the result is undesired by them, they announce as elected others whom they prefer. The members hold a weekly meeting, presided over by the Shaikh Abdulla al-Jabir, and give their views as to the requirements of the people and the town.' This 'selection' instead of selection of the Municipal Council is a grievance^ (E) SHCURITY . 1. There is no uniformed, or 'badged'. Police-14- Police Force in ICuvmit^ The Ruler has (a) soiae 30 personal bodyguo-rd and hawkers called ICHUDAM or servants, and (b) lias a call on certain tribesmen, who receive assistance, financial and in kind, in return for not migrating for afield, and thus remaining as an available reserve to hand* These latter are Known as the n FIDAWIYA n or ^Devotees'. A number of ICHUDAM, the personal bodyguard, are detached for the use of the town lieutenant or administrator, the Shaikh's cousin, while others are, when essential, sent out to investigate any quareel or other trouble among the Bedouins. There is no •permanent desert control system. Such emissaries when sent out travel in armed lorries (given to the Shaikh by an Oil Concessionaire.) The payment of all these men is about 40 rupees, 2 sacks of rice, and 2 maunds of dates, quarterly, but the amount varies from time to time, and usually includes a suit of clothes each summer and winter. To recapitulate there are no Police as such but (a) The Shaikh's bodyguard, mostly his hawkers (b) The Fidawiya. (c) The Lieutenant's bodyguard. and (d) some of the less intelligent of the latter who are used as Constables and night watchmen by the Municipality. (c) and (d) are paid by the Municipality and about the same rate as the others. 2.

This it had to do, because, once embarked on the scheme, there could be no turning back. Any compromise would have meant, sooner or later, great danger to the members of the Council.

The situation in Kuwait is that council under Presidency of Abdulla Salim cousin of the Shaikh have obtained complete control of the administration and for the time being the Shaikh is a cypher. 2« If the Shaikh had formed a council as he originally promised (see P.O. 13 page 73 para 3), or if he had taken the verbal advice of His Majesty's | Government (vide correspondence ending with India Office j ^ k i telegram 110.986 of May 24th), or had even at the last moment formed a council as suggested in my letter of | 18th June to him' (enclosed with my Express Letter'' hMl lTo.c/334 of 18th June) this council might well have remained advisory instead of an executive one.

Could you pleasi refer to % correspondence ending with my telegram iro.275 of 16th July 1938 on the subject of Kuwait citation, in which I promised a further report. This telegram was sent after discussion with de Gaury who arrived here on the 15th, and whose reports had pre ceded him. 2. The course of events has been as follows# \p 1 VA de Gaury duly presented my letter, mentioned in paragraph 4 of my Express Letter No.c/334 of 18th June 1938 to the Shailch, who in reply confined himself to generalities and compliments. He apparently had little idea of taking my advice. The fact that this advice had been given leaked out to the bazaars through the Shaikh*a Secretary - no Arab can ever keep his mouth shut even when it is to his interest to keep it closed* The advice in itself, however, was well received by the local notables, one of whom when calling on de Gaury, thanked him for the advice tendered. be issued by the «KUwait 3ecret Society% and further attacks June 1938) - continued to appear in the Iraq Press. These leaflets and articles referred to the unfortunate Bari 3 Leaflets probably printed in Iraq continued to on the Shaikh - broadcast/ .T. Peel, Esquire, The India Office, Iiondon.-2- ''1 broexioast arranged by the Shaikh which was the beginning, though not the cause, of the present trouble (see para- K 14 ^ * i£&gt; I graph 5 of my Express Letter Ho.G/ll7, dated 25th February 1938) t critised strongly the Shaikh's entourage, especially Izzet Jaafar, an importation frcsn S^ria, and demanded various reforms. (it was this same Izzet Jaafar who had sent the broadcast to Bari)• &gt; 4» Shaikh Abdulla bin Balim, the Shaikh's cousin who recently received the C#I.E,, then called on de Gaury with a copy of the original agreement made between Shaikh Ahmad and certain notables of Kuv/ait whereby he - She Shaikh - had promised to form a Council as a condition of his election as Ruler (see P.G.13 page 73 paragraph 3. The Shaikh has never called this Gouncil). Shaikh Abdulla himself, as one of the ruling family, felt that the present agitation might turn not only against the Shaikh but also against the family as a whole, and was shrewd enough to trim his sails to the risiiig wind. He is in any case, however, an individual possessing some learn ing and modern ideas. 5 * Three of the leading merchants of Kuwait, who had a large following behind them, then requested the Shaikh to form a Council, the membership of which would be elective. This the merchants insisted on, knowing that nominations to the Council would be made by the Shaikh from his immediate entourage, and not from his family and the notables. The same night the heads of the 150 leading families of Kuwait met and elected to the Council 14 persons. The Shaikh through his palace clique conaisting of his Secretaries/secretaries, the Director of the Municipality, and a merchant called Khalid 2aid, made a last desperate effort to win followers, large bribes, and various privileges being offered to any one who would default from the Council* These efforts were fruitless and merely brought further odium on the shailch and his clique. On the 4th July the rival parties, on the one hand the Ruling family and the notables, and on the other the Palace clique, including Khalid 2iaid, assembled in the Shaikh 1 s Mejlis for the usual morning coffee drinking, and for a final trial of strength. The following is an extract from de Gaury*s report. '♦The members of the Council demanded His Highness* formal approval, in writing, of a Council, which verbally he had sanctioned, but it now seemed had secretly tried to undermine. They spoke of his being misled by a few persons with private ambitions, against the wishes of the majority of his countrymen and against the interest of his family, which he neglected in favour of a few ignoble cronies. His Highness asked them what would be the outcome if he withheld his approval. '♦In that case* 1 said one of the leaders rising to his feet, and others with him, 'we bid you farewell ,, His Highness quickly denied that he intended to disapprove. In fact, their trump card, had he done so, was ready, in the jform of a petition, to be signed by all the notables, and presented at this Agency, asking for direct British Rule. His Highness then pretended to be, or was, per suaded of the worthlessMBs of Khalid az Z*id and hisolique, and turning upon them, publicly denied him and his followers who were immediately jostled from the Hall, and down the stairway, into the inimical crowd outside* His motor car had already been burnt. This was the only act of violence that took place during the agitation. 6. His Highness postponed his formal consent to the Council for another two days, but finally on the 6th July signed the necessary document. Of the Council de (Jaury writes ^The Council is composed of experienced men, used to weighing commercial enterprises, snd conducting the affairs of their large families, and the messages I have already received from them, make me believe that the result of their deliberations, if they obtain a decree of fiscal power, will lead to the administration of the territory on more efficient lines.' The President is Abdulla 3alim. ,4 itO *?• The powers of the Council, as you will see, from the document which I enclose, are extremely wide. (Some of the Law reads soaewhat like the declaration of the French Assembly in 1791. Abdulla Salim, who keeps an Arabic Encyclopedia, doubtless referred to it for guid ance when drawing it upl). In fact the Shaikh, as I stated in my telegram quoted above, for the time being is a cypher. The general policy of the Council can be seen from/-5- lf&gt; from the new Law. Article 3 which concerns Treaties, monopolies a ,nd agreements is of special interest to us. Bven here, howerer, the Council leave the signature of such documents to the Shaikh. The stipulation tnat any acts of the Shaikh need the Council's consent, whether under this article or any other, is not so revolutionary as might appear. All the other Rulers on the Arab side of the Gulf, in Bahrain, the Trucial Coast, and Muscat, invariably consult their family and notables before taking any step of importance, whether this is with re gard to an agreement with His Majesty's Government, a concession to an Oil Company, or a Blatter of internal administration. The difference that in Kuwait the powers of the Council have been made so extensive, and reduced to writing, is entirely due to the crass stupidity - I can use no milder term - of the shaikh (see paragraph 2 of my telegram quoted above). Bven after he had agreed to the Council as elected, the shaikh perservered in futile intrigues to undermine the Council, which merely served to exacerbate both them, and public opinion generally# 9. Reference the leakage of iqy letter to the Shaikh, referred to in paragraph 21 above. de Gaury is of the opinion, and I agree with him, that the arrival of this letter and its fortuitous leakage, came at the pysohological moment. The movement against the Shaikh was, as has been seen, overpowering, and a trial of strength between the popular party and the Ruler, in which the former were certain to have won, was bound to have occurred, either now or in the immediate future. My advice to the Shaikh to form a Council naturally fitted in with the plans of the popular party, and is indeed one of the main reasons that for the moment at all events they are extuemely friendly t owe rds us. Had the movement, however, come to a head \ without/6. without this advice to the shaikh, in popular opinion His Majesty's Government might well have been supposed to have supported the shaikh - tacitly if not actually and the victory over the latter would have been hailed as one over our His Majesty^ Government, As it is without/in any way offer\ing encouragement to the popular party, they are well disposed to us, while the coup d^tat, which is what the movement amounts to, has taken place - as de Gaury points out in one of his reports - without w the firing of a shot or the sending of a telegram 11 . The absence of telegrams is as gratifying perhaps as that of rifle shots. One can imagine circumstances in which the Council in the course of their struggle with the Shaikh might have bom barded the neighbouring Arab States - especially Iraq - with appeals for help. Iraq at least would undoubtedly have been only too glad for an excuse to meddle in Kuwait affairs. In this connection de Gaury informs me that the present Mutasarrif of Basra is especially active in openly advocating Iraq interference in Kuwait - *which is really a province of Iraq 11 . 10. With regard to the future. It is of course much too early to lay dmn definitely what our policy should now be in Kuwait, but generally speaking, we should I think, try and maintain a measure of balance between the Shaikh and the Council. Towards the latter we should endeavour to retain their present confidence, so that they turn to us naturally for unofficial advice, while making it clear that we still consider the Shaikh the Ruler, and officially responsible for Kuwaiti relations with His Majesty's Government. 11. I have no doubt that, though the Council at present/-7- 1114- present are sincerely pro British, as time goes by and their position beootaes assured, they may display ♦♦nationalistic* 1 tendencies which may at times take an awkward turn. But the Council is in being, as a development it was inevitable, and we must make the best of the good start which we have obtained. 12« I would like to stress the fact, which both the Shaikhs of the Persian Gulf and ourselves must realize, that the idea of popular movements, such as the present one at Kuwait, ha5 now permeated the Arab States, and must be taken account of, Br en on the backward Trucial Coast, at Debai (vide paragraph 3 of V. *' i ; J * '7 my TUxpress Letter Uo, 0/445 of 8th July 1938) the opposition party to the Shaikh asked for certain popular reforms. In this connection also please see Govern- ment of India letter No.F.230-K/55, dated 6th November 1935, and connected correspondence on the subject of agitation in Bahrain. This agitation has died away for the moment, as certain measures have been taken to comply with the demands of the Baharana* but I shall not be surprised if the latter., at some future date put up further demands for increased participation in the local government. Such movements will doubtless arise else where on the Arab Coast, and it is obvious that as the chief exponents of democracy His Majesty's Government cannot ally themselves with the Shaikhs to stamp these movements out, even if this were practicable. What we can, and what in my opinion we should do, is to try by exercise of judicious influence» to ensure that such movements come to fruition by a process of ^peaceful change*, as at Kuwait, rather than by violence, and that they should, also as at Kuwait, be well disposed towards us.11 r 3- 13 # Various attempts were made by the popular party to enlist the open support of de Gaury, who, however, acted with tact and discretion in refusing to be drawn into the struggle, thus exemplifying the dictum contained in the Introduction to the political Department Manuali n The best work of a political Officer is very often what he has left undone 14 . 14. I am afraid that I have made this rather a lengthy letter, but in view of the importance which the events of the last few weeks will probably have on our relations with Kuwait in the future, I have thought it as vfell to put on record a more or less complete account of them. « I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe, to Peterson with copies of recent telegrams quoted, and to de (raury. » sent under P.

X venture to suggest therefore that i&amp;e reply to the Iraqi foreign Minister should be on the following lines. 3* That the Shaikh has now in conformity with public ' opinion established a Council (its powers have been published in the Iraqi Jrress) to assist him in the administration of his State, and that his Majesty's Government expect that this step will lead to the increasing prosperity of Kuwait. xhat the formation of this Council in no way affects the relations between the Shaikh and His Majesty's Government who still consider him responsible for Kuwait's relations with them.

Memorandum The following is the result of our diacussions which we have had here towards aasisting the ahaiish and his new Council in the administration of iQmwait • 2* One of the most important points is finance. Excluding oil, you informed me that the Customs does make up about three-quarters of the Staters income. The Customs administration at present is carried on by an official under the Shaikh, and could probably, in your opinion, be much impuoTed. It would be well worth the State's while, we think, for it to obtain the services of an expert Customs official to visit Kuwait for a short period, aay a month, in order to reorganize the Customs administration, and put it on a modern footing. A Customs official from Bombay visited Muscat and Bahrain for this purpose some yeera ago, with extremely satisfactory results. The Customs receipts in each State, after ^his reorganisation scheme had been put into effect, increased considerably. The same results would doubtless come about at Kuwait. In order to assist the work of the Customs official the Council could do some spade work/ /| 'i-O work first in collecting figures of revenue and expenditure etc*» say over the last five year8 f and any other details which they think might be useful for hiza# 3. I think therefore that we should try and get an official of the Imperial Customs Service from India to visit Kuwait. On your returnjto Kuwait please make this proposal tentatively biid verbally to the Shaikh and the Council, and let me know their reaction. If it is favourable I will approach the G-overnment of India on the subject, letting His Majesty's Government know that I am doing this. The deputation of the Customs officer will of course cost the State something, but will be well worth while. If as a result of the Customs officer^ visit the Customs receipts go up, as they should, the political as well as the financial effect should be good* The Council • V i will associate the increased revenue of its State with the efforts of a British officer, and will therefore be all the more inclined to accept a British Financial Adviser, which we think the State ought to have. As oil revenues come in, and the finances of the State become more com plicated, the State must have an Adviser of some sort from outside, and from our point of view it is essential that he should be a British official, and not for instance an Iraqi. The importance of the post of financial Adviser lies in the fact that, since there are few subjects which are not connected with finance, either directly or indir ectly, whoever is appointed will have considerable indirect influence in political, as well as financial, matters, and might/m 3«* | &gt;1 migM make for himself a position suoh as Belgrade holds at Bahrain. It is essential therefore that the Adviser should be of British nationality. While we are arranging for the Ousting official we oan also be looking about for a possible financial Mviser, and while I am on leave X will consult the Home Bepartments. about the auetoms exi^ert to the Shaikh and the Counoil, you could ale© privately and psrsonally sound Abdulla ^alim on the question of an adviser. As you informed me # before recent events he expressed to you his opinion that an Adviser, like Belgrave at Bahrain^ would be an excellent thing.

To Political Agent t Kuwait# Repeated Secretary of State for India, London. Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, Simla. No. T/ffS Dated the 11th August 1938. IMPORTANT. My immediately preceding telegram (not situation repeated to Kuwait) describing/there. To my mind it is quite impossible to afford Shaikh support either moral or material in direct opposition to his Council for the sole object of retaining a foreign intriguer as his Secretary. If ShaiKh chooses this issue for trial of strength with Council he should recognise that he does so against our advice and with no prospect of support. Please fa&amp;RP&amp;b. him accordingly. No political advantage can accrue to us by interference, and we cannot afford to lose favourable position we hold at present over an affair of this nature. 2, So far as proposal for Adviser is concerned, is this made with support of Council? For obvious reasons we cannot take it up in present circumstances until Council have indicated agreement, preferably in writing. 3 # J am asking for sloop to move up in direction of Kubbar Island, prepared to go in to Kuwait if situation requires it. But it is of first importance to2 to obviate any possible belief that it is sent for support of Shaikhs (foreign) Secretary. I shall not therefore ask for it to move in unless there is prospect of outbreak involving danger to lives and property of British subjects• I shall only ask for armoured car as last resort. 4. Please use your best endeavours to make Shaikh see sense. He should have learnt by experience the strength of public opinion which will be behind Council against unpopular Secretary. If he uses intelligence he can still gain rather than lose prestige in yielding to Council on this issue. RESIDENT.4£&gt;/23 |U&gt; Telegram q From Political Agent, Kuwait.

Bitter feeling between Shaikh and Council over question of Secretary, with public supporting Council. Violence not very probable but quite possible, B. Should outbreak of violence occur or appear probable after communication of His Majesty's Govern ment's reply to Shaikh's request for support, we should issue usual warning to all parties against damage to lives and property of British subjects. I should then ask for Deptford to move in to Kuwait. (1) for moral (deterrent) effect as in similar occasions (e.g. at Dubai recently) (2) for refuge for British subjects in last resort. (2) is improbable but must be borne in mind. C. I cannot foretell at the moment, but I shall blar in mind importance of delaying Deptford as little as possible. I have written privately to you.

Though it is possible that Secretary's removal might he desirable in itself in view oi his unpopularity with Council I am very doubtiul as matter of principle of wis^dom of recognising any right on the part of Council to dictate to Shaikh on the question of appointments to his personal entoutage . This might set up very undesirable precedent. I am further concerned at Shaikh's threat of abdication . This is a possibility which needs careful consideration m View of the serious consequen ces that ma y ensue and it seems ax tmdesirahle thTt situation should develop in a way that may result in his abdication on this issue. 2. I would therefore urge that effort should be made to come to a compromise which will save Shaikh's face wiille at the same time satisfying wishes of Council. be forj ouncil to withdraw their demand for Secretary 's removal and for Shaikh after a ^decent' interval to dispense with his services of his own Iccord.

However there has been an interval for * cdoling - off ^ # and perhaps that has had some effect. 2 m I do nott of courseg know personalities in Kuwaitf but f^ttrm information gleaned from recent reports it seems to me highly improbable that any genuine rapprochement can now occur between the Shaikh and the Council. ( Actually the Secretary row gave him a great chance t and if he had^tt his course wisely he ought to have been able to take quite a lot of wind out of the Council^ sails. However he failed to do so and proved once again liis gift for making it impossible for us to help him adequately ). As I understand it our object is^o try to keep a xairly even / balance between the Shaikh and his Council. At the same time if we are to attempt to even things up a little at the moment ( the scales being well down on the Council* s SECRET MID PERSQ^AT. ^ D.O. Ho. C/545. Captain S.3.H. de Gaury, M.C., Political Agentt Kuwait.foru Council's side ) the nature of the weight age to be used must he approved *by us* And it must he so selected that it does not present the Council with all the propaganda value and enable them to mobilise public opinion against both the Shaikh and ourselves* In this Secretary row the only possible point on the Shaikhs side was the * personal appointment • aspects and though that might appeal to us as reasofeable enoughf would it to anyone in Kuwait ? It was unfortunate I misunderstood the reference in your first telegram to 'Private Secretary' ( in recent correspondence the 'Private Secretary* has been Izzet Jaafar and Khan Bahadur Salah was the M Secretary*) but whichever it might be# is it strictly correct to regard him as purely a member of the Shaikh's private entourage ? Both of them - and particularly the Persian • have beeni as I see it* very much political appointments for the purpose of dealing with public affairs. It seems to me that it would be just about as accurate to describe Goering or Goebbels as members of Hitler's personal entourage* But I should be grateful for your comments on this. 3, The next point la thin. I seem to remem'bcr that either Sir Trenchard or you told me toa.. the shaikh had oonslderahle funds ealted down in Syria or Egypt in preparation for a flit at any tine. if this is so thie idea of ahdioatlon is no new thing - it may happen any moment - and we need not he in such a fritter of anxiety to prevent it. If.then. the Shaikh is a likely starter for Syria in any erent { barring unqualified support from us,ust which can scarcely 'be forthcoming ) would it do us any great harm if he went fairly soon ? Would it not he better to let him go before he has collected too much oil money - and sent it out of the country ? And if he is to go can we not acquire a little public merit out of it ? We d2. want a British Adviser in and I should hare thought that we might stand a good chance of getting one in with everyone's approval in Kuwait as the result of a change of Shaikhs following just such an affair as this • lhat do you think about this ? 4 # The final question is this.

Bo you agree that the present compromise is good enough for our purpose ?. It is that the Sheikh has not dismissed his secretary but sent him on indefinite leave (He is about 75 years old.). The ^cooling off** was admittedly more on Sheikh^ side than that of the Council# In view of the strength of their own and public opinion they did well in keeping order as long as they did. I am sure that if the secretary had not left last night there would have been a serious disturbance today or tomorrow# With reference to Pare 2, I agree that any genuine rapproachement between the Sheikh and Counoil now seems very far off, if not quite impossible. Quite recently, inspite of all my hints and suggestions, he was still taking them as if they were the enemies instead of his government. I agree with you entirely in your remark at top of Page 2 of your letter and X think that 'the nature of the weightage' must be soon thought of and I make some suggestions below in this letter. I agree that the personal appointment aspect woulo not have appealed to people in Kuwait in a way it would have to us. ?eightman Esquire,I.C.S#, )ffmating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at Bahrein.- 2 - E\ With regard to the misunderstanding about the name Of the Private secretary it would have been better if I had explained that it was Khan Bahadur Mulla Saleh, who formerly, sad for the last forty years or so. was in fact Kuwait Government, and the first and the only Kuwaiti Adviser of the Sheikh. You could imagine what a position he achieved for himself and ofcourse the real tussle was, as it were, between two rival governments. 5 . Since the formation of the Council the Sheikh was driven to call him his-'private secretary'. Right up until the last moment Uulla Saleh was undoubtedly hopeful of smashing the Majlis. He had tried to rouse the Persians, of whom there are about twenty thousand to support him, and it was this, called by the Council 'The Revolt of the Persians' which determined them more than anything else to get rid of him, finally and completely» e. nth r.s.rs to P.r. s li ' il. .on.ld.r.bl. reouroaa 1» ™rio«= I hi. ml. deposit .o«.»t t.o y..r. «o £.120,000, mi .loo. «..« It »»3t K.v. !&gt;«» oon.W.r.bly I''' £ - 50 ' 000 0r fr&lt; ' 011 H. 01. t» good propartle.

He-3- surrounded by retainers, almost free, out of the produce of his flocks and reources in kind. Only today I heard from Harris, Manager of the that a periodic payment of £.1000/- by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to the Sheikh's account has been changed by the Sheikh's instructions to the name of, he thought, Subah bih Ahmad Jabir, who is his son aged about eleven years. Harris promised to confirm this. It was a rather mysterious account which was apparently not in connection with the Kuwait Oil Company. Obviously too there are good many perquisites of office for a Ruling Sheikh, whatever the constitution. On the other hand the Sheikh told me that in accordance with the Council's inaugural law he had promised that he would at the end of the year, when it is due, transfer the Kuwait Oil Company's cheque^about £.7000/, to ghe Council and all the main resources of the country will now go into the Council's hand; so that he can't be considered to be 'screwing' any longer. Xt seems to me that whoever is politically on the underside for the moment here is in favour of a British Adviser. It is not so long ago since the present members of the Council were sending me messages to say that they wanted an Adviser to control the Sheikh. Now that they are in office I do not think they would favour one for a moment. It is not so much the advice they dread as his 'interference and hundred percent efficiency. However I foresee that the time may come when the Council will begin to fall out among themselves, and I dare say, although there are no signs of it at the moment, that an opposition outside the council may form and presumably will drift to the Sheikh's side. There may come a moment when the Council ask for assistance In the interval, it is possible, out of zeal and rawness, they may be rather a nuisance, and without really meaning to do so may raise serious issues , or by some hasty order-4K; i cut across agreements or the oil concessions^ I hope not, and X will endeavour 'to coach Abdulla Sallm behind the scenes# This is hardly a Political Agent's business and I feel that either they ought to have an Adviser for 'Foreign Affaires (including relations with Oil Company) and Defence' if nothing else or that those two subjects must be clearly reserved to the Sheifch. Reference the question of abdication and possible successor to Sheikh Ahmad, if he went, as mentioned in Para 4 of your letter. First I should say that, today, the Sheikh shows absolutely no sign of wanting to abdicate. I find him very cheerful, and I have no doubt he has the picture of Bahrein strongly in his mind at last, and hopes that we now, as he has asked for an Adviser, we will soon help him to achieve something like it, regardless of the fact that he himself has made it most difficult to do so. However if he did abdicate, I think Abdulla is about the only possible candidate. In the last few days of crisis he has had, in the customary Arab way, to fall back on and support the Subah family, and in consequence is not so popular as he was with the Council. I think generally speaking that he is fairly popular and fairly able. He is certainly extremely pleased with the C.I.S., and was the first, some weeks ago (see my D.O.No.C-220 of S4th June. 1938) to suggest a British Adviser, and I know that he agreed with and encouraged the Sheikh to ask for one the other day. He always says that he relies on us, and 1 believe that he would be better than Sheikh Ahmad in'and with the Council, but this ofcourse is not saying much. \ \ C\ r Retorning again lastly to -the nature of 'weightage' mentioned in your Para 2 I can only suggest the following:- (a) Throwing the burden of proving their legitimacy o. Counoll- W. couia ..K HI. W- to.law in due course express perturbation at its loose drafting. ( The Council hanker after 'recognition'' hy His Majesty's Government and are self conscious about the method of their 'election'). (b) The Council (who are townsmen merchants) do not presumably wish Kuwait's relations with the British, the Bedouins, and Ibn Baud, to deteriorate but I feel sure they will, unless, as I have said above, Their function in the matter of Defence and (their) External Affaires is at the most only Advisory to the Sheikh Iwho naturally follows British advice). Or alternatively 1?) Their function in matters of Defence and External 1 affairsi* I i.e.internally) executive, but that, for these two departments they have a British Adviser, ^ I think that an early solution one or the ohher of these lines is essential. (c) Support the Sheikh by inviting him officially to London, as early as possible, not later than next spring. ( I believe the Oil Company also wish to entertain him there)• (d) Have you noticed India Office D.O .No.74&amp;9/S6 of 29th October 1936 to Sir Trenchard Fowle in which it was suggested that the Resident should choose a favourable moment for discussing the question of foreign relations of Kuwait with the Sheikh of Kuwait. It is not necessarily 'weightage', but you may like to note it in this connection. TUe fact that we are negotiating a new Agreement might be useful in putting off outside enquirers who hope to interfere for one reason or another and who will fasten on to the inaugural law. ( I have already been asked for a copy of the law by the American Consul, Baghdad.

S. de Gaury,AIR MAIL* confident ial Office of the Political Hesideit in the Persian Oulf, t &gt; t O , HO &gt;Q/554 of 1958 Gamp, Karachi* Dated the 22nd August, 1938 Will you please refer to the attached copies of de Haury*# telegrams Mo.266 and 267 of tne 15th and 16th August 1938 on the subject of troubles at Cuwait. 2 # I met de Gaury in Basrah on the 18th-19th August and discussed tne whole problera fully with him. ; rhe camaents and suggestions below represent our joint views. 3. The departure of the Secretary on indefinite leave removes the immediate cause of dissension, but does not, I fear, go far towards composing the essential difiereiices between the Shaikh spd his Council. In order that there may be no misapprehension on this point I should remarx that de Saury had himself suggested the leave solution in the early stages of the dispute, that the Bhaiich at that time rejected the suggestion, and that the deciding factor, as he admitted to de Gaury, was that he had been informed tnat the Secretary would be stoned if he did not leaTe Kuwait ceiore daylight on the 16th August, de Grauxy has little doubt tnat if he personally had not made quite sure that the 3ecretaX5? did in fact leave Kuwait before daybreak that morning tnere would have been serious disturbances; and he informs me that the council did extremely well, in rimr of the bitterness public opinion, to prevent an earlier outbreaic. 4. / T. Peel ^squire, M• G•» The India Office London*1^ -2- 4, I am afraid tnat the use of the designation ^Private Secretary** in early reports has tended to ofcaoure the real issue. I myself read to refer to lazat Jaffar who had hitherto been described as tne PriYate Secretaiy while ta® •Secretary 11 was the Persian Khan Bahadui* Mulla «ialeh« xne latter's official title was changed on the creation of the Council* Neither person, however, could properly be regarded as merely @4 member of the Qhailch's p?tk*e*t entourage? both were directly concerned in the pre-existing administration; and indeed it is scarcely too much to say that Mulla Qaleh was. the Q or em iaent. Thus this dispute waa (and is), in actual fact, a struggle between the new sod old forms of administration, and now that these two men have gone it must be our objec^ to attempt to build up some sort of co -operation fcet veen the Shaikh and his Council. This is clearly a most difficult problem and personally I cannot altogether eliminate some feeling of regret that the Shaikh has now, according to de (Jaury, completely put out of his mind any idea of abdica tion. (With the obvious successor, Shaikh Abdulla Mn Salim, the problem would be infinitely simpler). 6, The situation then, in ita esaortials, reraaina un- ehanged. The Shaikh continues, in spite of de Saury 's frequent attempts,to lead him to a more reasonable point of view, to regard the Council as 'the eneBV'. He displays not tbe least inclination to co-operate withfcCm, and he expects, by his request for a British Adriser, to enlist tne aid and support of His Majesty's OOTemment against tnem. It is significant that he told de Gaury that he himself does not beliere that the Council will willingly accept an AdTi.er. de Gaury /1%^ de C-aury, too, is of the opinion, vo. th wnion 1 entirely eonour, that any approach to the Council on the question oi an A^Tiaer at this stage would De a aerio^JS error in tactics, for the 3hai!£h'a move ia ao obvioualy designed, and will unqueationably be recogniaed in Kuwait, aa an attempt to uce the power of tae Britiah GOTemment to break the Council. And incidentally de Gaury and I have little doubt tnat if be were to auoceed he would lose no opportunity of anifting all the odium on to the ahouldera of Hia llajeaty'a Government. on the other hand the Council, which after all is naKing some attempt to begin to introduce reforms into the administration, could at the beat only regard our advocacy of auch an appointment at tne moment aa a clear indication of miatruat of their motiTea and abilitiea. In sjofl circumstances no Adviser could adequately oari-j out nib funeticms, and public opinion, reacting to the Council's resentuent, must become increasingly hostile to ilia Majesty^ GOT eminent* 6. It aeema to me therefore that our firat atep must be to disabuse both parties - and in particular the Shaikh - any idea that we regard them as alternative and mutually repugnant manifestations of authority in %u «ai , oi we are likely to take sides in their dist^ reemeit s. Ho progress can be made until the Shaikh realises that His Majesty's Government recognise the Council aa an eaaential feature of the adminiatration of Kuwait and, by implication, thai they are not prepared to aaaist in any manoeuvres designed to destroy **£. On their side tne Council must understand tnat in spite of their -Inaugural iaw- we regard the /V ■ ■ ■ no'' » the Shailtli aa «ie symbol of authority In Kuwait, and that, as Sir Trenohard 7owle remarked in paragraph 10 of ilia demi- official letter 1(0,396-3 of the 18th July 1938, the Sflaiah is still officially responsible for Kuwait's relations with His Majesty 's Ooven ment. I propose tnerefore triat the next step should be lines of paragraph 3 of Sir i'renonard fowle's telegram Ho,27S of the 16th July 1938, where he suggested that a message should be sent to tie Shailch on behalf of His Majesty's aovernment, tnough in vie* of subsequent deYelopments it is clearly necessary to revise the phrasing of the communication. She following ia a rough idea of the kind of message I have in mind* • I am directed by His Majesty's Oovernment to inform Your Highness that they have learnt with sat is f act i on of your establishing a council. I understand that in taking this step Your Highness has been actuated by a desire to associate the representatives of your people with your administration, aid they trust that this admirable sentiment will be fully implemented in practice, fhey hope that there will be close and constant consultation between Your Highness and the members of your Council, and that your deliberations with them will be coaducted in a spirit «f mutual trust and confidence and will be distinguished by m sincere desire to advance the best interests of Kuwait by your oo-operation.* - His Majesty's Government confidentlaily expect that the happy relations which have so long subsisted between themselves and the Ruler of Kuwait will be confirmed /I rn&amp;m ^con^irtiisd and s'trong't^snedj s^nd in particular tii&amp;t there will be no disturbance of existing ar rang erne nte by wMcii they underta^e^ in agreement with txie Auler, to conduct the foreign affairs of Kuwait. It is on this assumption that 1 m instructed to assure Your Ttighness of the continued intention of His Majeety's aoYemment to preserve the integrity of Kuwait against external aggression.** 7, This, it will be seen, blandly ignores tne recent trouble since no particular object can toe served oy reviving unpleasant memories, I f illy realise that the latter part of the suggested csmmunication goes beyond tne strict letter of our Treaty position, but it would be ©• pity to miss su excellent an opportunity of attaining the ot^^ee^ out^in the correspondence leading up to your letter Ho.P.^.'7459/36 of the 29tli October 1936. 1 share de Saury's opinion that His Highness is unlikely seriously to contest at such a juncture a written a t at era on t of what is, after all, the practical position. 8, It seems to ffleT it is of equal Isiportanoe that sane c ommunioation, whether written or verbal, be made to the members of the Council, the 'Inaugural law' arms then with greater authority in respect of external affairs aa d dealings with foreigners generally than we can oaafortably acknowledge. The exact terias of this law need not be taken too seriously, particularly since it has not been coramunicated officially _ . A to the Political Agent, but it is, I suggest, essential to reaoTo from the minds of the council any imprespion that we might regard them as the sole repository of authority in Kuwait /14° i Kuwait, t2iat we should be prepared to deal with them to the exclusion of the Shaikh, or that we should tolerate their interference vdth foreign affairs or their assumption of sole authority in respect of the otner matters recited in Article 3 of the Law, de Oaury has already thrown out a few hints to the members of the Council on these lines, d he informs me that they show no inclination to dispute his state ment of the controlling power exercised by His Majesty^ Government® At the present stage a formal pronouncement made with the authority of His Majesty's Government (a) that we regard the Shaikh as the constitutional head of the State with whom our official relations will be maintained, (b) repeating in general terms the advice to the Shaikh in regard to consultation and co-operation, sd d (c) stating in unequivocal terms our insistence on control of foreign affairs and dealings with foreigners generally, would excite no hostile reaction, and might well serve tooth to enhance the 3hailch , s prestige and to create a more reason able balance between him and the Oouncil# 9, Action on the above lines will at least serve to clear the air and to remove misunderstanding, but if it is to produce effective results it is important that it should be taken without delay, before Iraqi intrigue and influence is brought to bear on the members of the Council# ICh To revert now to the Shaikh's formal request for a British Adviser. It seems to me that we can at the moment only /12. / (I 1 -7- only ignore this, and tnat de Gaury might toe instructed to reply to an/ further enquiries frosi the SJaaiicii by saying tiaat His Majesty's Oorernment await the development of a fuller measure of oo-operation between him and his Council and a clearer indication that the request represents a decision ta^en by ^the Shaiich acting with his Council 11 before tney take the matter into c ons icier at i on. It is by no means Improbable that the time will soon come when the Council will be ready to look much more favourably on sucn an appointmeit# The surprising unanimity which actuates tnem aid the whole hearted public support which they enjoy at present can scarcely last for ever, ard as their difficulties increase so will their minds revert to the idea of a British Adviser - an idea which appealed so strongly to many of them in pre- Council days, before they themselves enjoyed the savour of authority. I doubt if it is necessary to argue tne advantages of introducing a British Adviser sooner or later, and if this is accepted in principle it will no doubt be possible for de Gaury, as time goes on t to Help ti» idea talc. fre«h. root la the wind, of the Council. 11. I am afraid this letter is very long and oontfains little that is imaiediately constructive, but it stems to me that constructive development cannot occur until our own position is understood quite clearly and until ^lie ahai^h in particular realises that we cannot be lured into participation in his scheiaes to destroy the Sounoil.

My dear Baggalay, My despatches Nos. 437 and 447 ot 7th and 10th September about Koweit. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs may have given some indication of at least one strong motive for Iraqi interest m Koweit when he asked me v esterday if it was true that oi a popu lation of about 50,000 some 20,000 were Iranians and « whether the latter had objected to the ohaikhs new Jouncil. I said that I could not answer him off hand, but having looked things up I told him, wheu I happened to see him this morning, that I ■ .h there were about 20,000 Iranians in Koweit and that it was true that a certain amount of absolutely ina^nc^re agitation against the Council had been got up amongot some of them by a certain disgruntled official. As you well know, these people are terrified oi Iran and view with thejutmost concei'ii an^y signs of Iranian penetration on the Arabian side of the Gulf. As he had brought up Koiweit, I told him that on my return from seeing him last week, I had had a good look at the map ancjjhad made a few infer mal inquiries on my own about smuggling. It seemed to me, from study of the map and from talking to people who had been down there, that the prevention oi smuggling through A1 Batin, wh ere whole armies could nide, was an/-an almost superhuman task. x.e had suggested, th^t the Shaikh himself mi^ht be implicated. My very superficial enquiries had led me to wonder whether the Iraqi authorities in the southern towns could be entirely above suspicion either. How else could the smugglers, who appeared to move about in very larere convoys, dispose of their contraband with impunity and to such an extent V I do not want to detract from my despatch; but I felt it would do no harm to give the Minister something to think about, oo.
