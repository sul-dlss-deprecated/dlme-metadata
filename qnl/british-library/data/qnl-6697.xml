TURKISH CLAIMS ON THE ARABIAN COAST. In 1879 Lord Craabrook expressed the view that 'prorided no obstacles are interposed to any operations 'which may be necessary to preserve the peace of the seas w and to punish marauders, and that *o interference is 'attempted either with Bahrein or the Trucial Chiefs from 'Odeid to Ras el Khymah, or with Muscat ,, no exception need be taken to the proceedings of the Turics at any point of the coast north of Odeid. The result of correspondence with the To reign Office was the issue of two sets of instr uctions# iPirst, Sir H.Layard was instructed to propose to the Porte an arrangement, whereby H.M b cruisers should be authorised to pursue and capture pirates within the 3 mile limit off the Arabian Coast North of Odeid, Second, Sir H.Layard was infomed that it was useless to attempt an explicit settlement of the question, in view of the exagger- (T ated claims to sovereignty which the Porte is always prepared to advance; but that Hs* Majesty^ Government held a decided view that 'wherever the Turkish sovereignty is at 'the present time firmly established upon the coast, they 'are ready to recognise it, and would gladly see it 'accompanied by a regular and civilized administration.' In short, the objection was not to Turkish rule to the OdQ/L^ north of^^aiA, but to anarchy. The substance of the first set of instructions was conveyed to the Porte by Mr.Goschen in his Note of the 7th July 1880. The Turkish Government replied 8 February 1881 that they were infonned that no such thing as piracy existed in the Persian Gulf; that nevertheless a vessel of war had been sent to the Nejd coast as a precautionary measure and that in the circum stances there was no occasion for the proposed arrangement. TheThe final result was that British naval officers were given a certain liberty of action in regard to the Arab coast. (P.O. to Admiralty dated 11 July 1881). In 1881 trouble arose with Sheikh Jasim of El Bidaa, Chief of El Katr. There has been a Turkish garrison (350 men) at El Bidaa since 1872. (The position of the Turks at El Bilaa frosa our poi*t e vi. tw is thru, dt-c -f bt in the PoO. letter of 26 August 1893 • n so long as the 'Turkish ai thorites do not move beyond the limits of the 'town, the nominal suzerainty of the Porte is recognised; w but any attempt to extend Turkish authority is resi8ted w ). Sheikh Jasim who is still the de jure , if Sheikh Ahmad is the de facto , ruler of El Katr, formerly (3 May 1881) regarded himself being Wahabi , as a Turkish subject on land, adding 'the seas and what is connected with it are under the British Government' t In point of fact, his father had entered into an agreement with Colonel Pelly in 1868, binding himself w on no pretence whatsoever at any time to 'put to sea with hostile intentions' and invariably to refer disputes to the Resident. Some doubt, however, existed as to whether this agreement was not personal to Sheikh Jasim* s father; and, though Sheikh Jasim, on being infomied that he would be held responsible to the British Government for his conduct, expressed a desire to renew it, the n Government of India considered it undesirable owing to his relations with the Turks (28 April 1882). Irritated probably at this rejection of his overtures, the Sheikh, who had previously under pressure from the Resident given up a maritime expedition he had contemplated against Katif, proceeded to illtreat British Indian merchants resident at El Bidaa: and ultimately the Resident had to proceed to the spotspot with two ships of war, Fortunately, ths Sheikh then came to terms, so that possible collision with the Turkish garrison was averted. The Porte protested; and was informed that H.M,Grovemment had never admitted the claim to Turkish sovereignty over El Katr. In 1893 Sir Clare Pord informed the Porte that H.M,Government, while admitting that the sovereignty of the Sultan extended from Bus so rah to Katif, considered that the coast south of that place was 'debateable land', and the Government of India were instructed that H.M,Government continue to deny the claims of the Turkish Government to exercise sovereignty ov-r El Katr peninsula: that Turkish pretensions need not interfere with our liberty of action, or prevent our making such treaties with El Katr Chiefs as might be considered desirable, (No.35, dated 8 Sept,1893). In 1894 the Turkish Mutessarif of El Hasa went to Zobara, and, in concert with Sheikh Jasim took stepsj^o form a settl-ment of Bahreinese malcontents at that place under the Turkish*®jl»^. This step was regarded by the British Government as a to Bahrein, and, an ineffectual protest having been made to the Porte, H.M.S. 'Sphinx' proceeded to the spot and took forcible measures. The Porte protested; and Lord Salisbury once more declined to recognise Tu?^cish jurisdiction over El Katr (August 1895 and December 1896), At this time Sheikh Jasim announced f ' that h e resigned his position as Turkish Kaimakam of El Katr. It appears, however, that the Turks regarded him or his brother Ahmad as nominal Kaimakam as recently as 1899; and that they had also in El Katr an Assistant Katmakam, who was practically their 'Resident', (1663/1900) Subsequently (1898) his relation* with the Turics became much strained owing to their support of Koweit, which had raided a tribe professing allegiance to Sheikh Jasim, LastLast year, the Government of India proposed to make a Protectorate Treaty with Ahmad bin Thani, who is described as the de facto rulery Sheikh Jasim being now superannuated. In reply the Government of India were instructed not to allow the Resident to do more tha^imake preliminary enquiries or to commit the Indian Government to any obligations pending the result of further discussione (No.37, dated 5 September 1902.) Then came from Constantinople a report that the Turkish Government proposed sending garrisons to certain places on the Arabian coast, including Odeid and Zooara. The Government of India propose that we should prevent the occupation of Zobara and Odeid, on the same grounds as in 189 5 ^viz, on the ground that it would be a menace to Bahrein. They also renew their suggestion about an agreement with Ahmad bin Tiiani, but do not press it. The position at Zobara was held so recently as 1896 to oe sufficiently important to Bahrein to justify fls in forcibly turning out the settlement fostered there by the Tuiics. As to Odeid, its status was detemined by the Govsi'nment oi India in their despatch No.^ 7 of IS^g, n 0deid belongs to w the Chief of Aboothabee, with whom the British Government 'has maintained direct treaty relations for many years, and ♦ftitatlthe pretensions of Turkey to claim the settlement rs ' a dependency of a Turkish district are vague and without ^foundation. It may be true that Sheikh Batay of Odeid has 'occasionally hoisted the Turkish Hag, that he has claimed 'Tuiicish protection, and that he has latterly paid a small 'tribute to El Bidaa. But the existence of a separate and 'independent Chiefship at Odeid has never been recognised, 'and the act of Sheikh Batay in establishing a settlement 'there was an infraction of the prescriptive territorial 'rights of Aboothabee. The declaration of the Odaid Sheikh 'and of his colomy, that they put themselves unaer Turkish p ro t ection'protection, would not in any way, of itself, justify the 11 Turks in asserting their jurisdiction over the place. w If such a plea were admitted, it would be set up by every 'petty Chief along the coast who might have good reasons for 'desiring to evade control or chastisement.' There seems, therefore, to be notning ii 1 our previous dealings with the Turks inconsistent with our right to protest against an occupation of Zobara,, whilst we have over and over again refused to admit their claim to interfere with t he Trucial Chiefs, and therefore with Odeid. The Turkish Ambassador in 1893 asked for the text of our treaties with the Trucial Chiefs, and we consented. Presumably, therefore, th.5 Turkish Government are quite aware of the limits which we claim for our own.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00019d_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B141</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00019d</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B141</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Persian Gulf.
