Born in 1958 in Old Qurna and coming from the tribe of Al-Horoobaat, he recalls his familyâ€™s move when he was a young child from Qurna to Kafr El Sheikh and then to Ain Shams in Cairo, due to his  father's work in the police force. He describes family life growing up, his schooling, and playing with friends in the Sayeda Zeinab neighborhood. He tells about his brief work in the tourism industry in Qurna, and his study of geology and work as a health and safety engineer assessing oil field safety for an Abu Dhabi company.  He contrasts life in Qurna now with the past when, he asserts, people got along better and were less concerned with tribal affiliations. Awad discusses the impact of new knowledge and technology on social change in Qurna. He voices his support for the government's move of the residents of Old Qurna to new settlements, due to conditions in Old Qurna like an insufficient sewage systems damaging to the houses there.</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
