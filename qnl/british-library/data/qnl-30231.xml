My inlorarnt told me that a passenger from -^eboi who passed through Muscat a few days ago has informed him that a -Baluchi dhow has recently shipped a large consignment of arms from Deboi for kekran. These dhows do not cross the open sea directly from Arab to -Bersian coast but they keep mXxn along the Arab const up to Khor Fakkan and the neighbourhood of Khodhrah and Suwaiq and then proceed to Persian coast where I understand they have some bandobast with the Persian Customs Kudirs of the small ports such as Tank, Galek, ofe* and other places. There is no likelihood of any arms havi ing been shipped from Muscat itself though I understand the Baluchis some times make their purchases locally from certain individuals who deal in arms in Matrah on a small scale. The Baluchis also purchase their arms at Batinah from the Omanis from who get their stock by land/Debai. The Baluchis proceed ttxwKt from Batinah to Mekran direct. I am on the look out and if I get any further important information on this subject I will pass it on to you by signal. A sum of 500 dollars is sent herewith.

SECRET Note on the present arms traffic in Persian Gulf with special reference to Muscat Territories® -cOo-- i* The trade is believed to be entirely in the hands of Baluchis though Omanis may be indirectly involved • 2o The Baluchis of the Batineh Coast have trade, and other, relations with the Baluch of Persian Mekran, continuous contact between the two is normal# 3® The chief centres of the Baluch population apart from Muscat and Matrah, are (a) HASAJFIN (10 miles south of SHIMS, (b) KHADRA (15 miles S.E. of KHABURAH) (c) SHIRS and (d) ABU l ABALI (both the latter adjoining WUDAM). All of these are coastal villages practically entirely populated by Baluch. 4. THARMAD, lying some 7 miles south and inland of KHADRA, was a stronghold of the arms traffic in former days. One Abdulla bin Mohammad ed Dawwar, of this village, was a notorious trafficer between the coastal villagers and the interior. It is not at present known if he is still alive, but if so he is certain to be involved* 5* Another notorious trafficer was one Brahim Sundi, a nakhuda of SHIRS, whose whereabouts are not &amp;iow known. If either of the above individuals are met with they may certainly be considered suspect. 6. It has been quite customary in the past for impover ished Omanis to sell or mortgage their rifles to the coastal Baluchi, but such rifles are more generally obsolete patterns or .303 carbines (single shot). A really modern rifle is rarely seen and then only with a Sheikh. They are either .303 magazine, or Mauser rifles with magazines. They are invariably in bad condition but all arms are good enough for local tribal warfare, which chiefly consists of H firing high”. 7. It would be quite easy for Baluchis to collect, and put on board a dhow, small quantities of such rifles but it is doubtful if the Batineijcan provide large batches of the same as the local inhabitant is not willing to part withag iw .X i *io • S ft fd-o 100 *&amp; ina (b) 9'IQ Affii exxO &gt;d-on d'jjcf .5 511 d 3 'il j-^eo j .3 9dsi LflBtl r. o:o ‘a-iBi 60S* OiV/ix LbooX .V D Xijq ob ax 917183 what he regards as his insurance policy* So Information, cariled from a local source, which is regarded as reliable joints to contraband arms being readily available at Dibai, where without trouble, they are shipped on dhows which hug the Arab littoral ao far as KHOR FAKKAN and the Batineh before crossing to GALAG and TANK on the Persian Mekran coast* 9* These dhows may possibly pick up small additional consignments at the Baluch centres before sailing for Mekran but, as far as can be ascertained up till now, large consignments are not available. German ships of the Hansa Line have given no cause for suspicion when cqlling at Matrah and it is unlikely that they would try to off load arms there. It this line is engaged in trafficking, arms would certainly be transhipped at sea by night at jm± appointed rendez-vous. 11. No further definite information is as yet available but every means is being adopted to obtain the same.

German steamer Neuenfels sailed for Dabai 2nd instant she fras boarded by Bideford and appeared innocent.Statement made by Ahmad bin Muhammad Baluchi of Geh aged about 33 years. Recorded on 11th December 1934. About a month ago a certain Ahmad Shah and 16 men come from Kuch by their own Badan^to Matroh. 8 men of them stayed at Matrah and 8 went to W Q di Semail for the purpose of purchasing arms. After 10 days those who went to Wadi Semoil returned with 300 rifles and a large number of ammunition which were brought by camels. These arms and ammunition were shipped in 3 badons which were iyxHgxMm waiting somewhere near Qorm. The rifles were 10-shot^ 5-shot and single shot. The cost of each rifle is between 20 to 60 dollars. The names of the bakhudas of the Badans are Abdur Bahim, Muhtaj and Jangian. All of them fcxiox ore living at Kuch. The Badans left for Kuch and on arrival the rifles and ammunition were landed and loaded 6n camels and sent to the interior. The rifles were wrapped in gunny bags and pocked in firewood when they were brought by camels from ‘“'email. I embarked on the badon of Jangion and sow every thing by my own eyes. Kuch is somewhere between Gugesor and Maidoni. Two months ago there w&lt;' re some bezamis at huch but went away. On my recent visit to Kuch I sow some -Nozomis there but l do not know whether they stay there or go away* The ^ezomis arrived after sending the arms and ammunition to the interior. The Baluchis who deal in arms might return to Muscat after the Id-—Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf tur H | 4 ) L 1 / As ordered I ieft Muscat for Batinah coast in the morning of 1st December for the purpose of e making enquiries in the matter of the arms traffic and beg to submit my report on the subject. As I was a starnger to all the places and at the same time well known to the inhabitants as the Munshi of the Consulate I hod to tell every body ItivtX wherever I halted that I was going to see the landing ground at Shinns* I adopted many different lines in conducting my enquiries about the arms* One of them was the question of the pilgrims and other destitutes who arrive at Muscat* During my enquiries at Barkah where I arrived on the 1st instnnt I found out that there is no likelihood of anyone dealing in arms because very few Baluchi/ dhows touch at that port* The Baluchi boats might anchor off the Suwodi Island where they are quite safe and can sail whenever they find a suitable opportunity to do so. They even con conceal their arms there if they suspect that they are in danger of being discovered. My enquiries at Masna’ah, Suwaiq&gt; Khaburah, Saham and Sohar did not achieve any result* On the 6th instant when I went to Shinas I learnt from the Customs M uc ii r in the course of my enquiries for the Indian and other boats which import the pilgrims that the following Baluchis who are living at Shinos are somewhat suspicious in their movements* 1. Muhammad Modok owns a Bogharah with one mast. 2. Shanbeh owns a jooly boat with one mast. 3. Yusuf Karam own -do* -do- 4. Salih Muhammad .do-—uurrx~uy cmrO S ,41 and ae far ae I could gather from the Customs Mudir they first despatch a party by land to Khor Fakkan and then send their boats by sea to the same place. On asking the Mudir the object of sending a party by land he said that as far as he is aware the Baluchis who are sent by land are for the purpose of purchasing cows as many as they con get on their way to Khor Fakkan where they ship them in .their boats and send them to l^ekran. Their chief^of call if Sadaich* This is the business of these Baluchis and on their return from ^ekron they do not bring anything. On my way back to Sohar I halted at Hosaifin and called on Muhammad bin Sulairaan, the leading man of the place. T could not get anything out of him but learnt from him that the Baluchis of Soor el ibri own dhows. I had to go bock to that place and in the course of my conversation with the Customs Mudir who happened to be there I found out that the undermentioned Baluchis who own dhows have direct dealings with Debai and Mekran. 1. Lol Bakhsh Muhammad owns a Boom with one mast -do- * a jolly boat -do- 2- 4amad Isa owns a Boom with one mast 3. Husein Hchiradad owns a ^oom with one mast. 4. Khudadad All 11 a Bagharah -do- 5. Haji Ahmad Muhd. ' a Boom -do- These Baluchis proceed from Soor el ibri to ^ebai where according to the Customs Mudir take their requirements such as tea sugar etc. and then then /u&gt; sail for '“ekran. Their chief port of call 4^ Sirik. On return from ^ekran they do not bring anything. Also these ^oluchis send a party by land. The Mudir did not know for what purpose they go by land but said that the Baluchis always smuggle their goods and very seldom pay any duty. On the 8th instant on my return to Muscat I halted at W U dam where 13 . sow large dhows lying on the beach. On enquiry I found out that a certain Morad Khan, one of the &amp; 20 &amp;. Baluchi chiefs of M ekran, was at Khadhrah. This individual does not jtggM possess any boat of his own but constantly visits Mekran in the boat of other Baluchis who have settled Ulkx at Khadhrah and own dhows and gardens there. One of the Chief of the Baluchis who has settled at Khadhrah for years is colled Muhinu Whilst at Shinas and other places I was told by the individuals in the course of my conversations with them that they hove often seen the Baluchi guuckx dhows passing their ports without touching at any of them. The Baluchis who ore on very fiendly terms with Sheikh Hamad bin Hilal al Saadi and who import slaves for him from &amp;ekran xzm. would be able to carry on$ the 'arms business at Khodhrah where ifcx Muscat State authorities hove no influence and authority. The *ol Sa’od tribe have large dhows which proceed to Africa, Socotra, Southern Arabia, J ‘ruciol Coast and Basrah. They con easily purchase arms and ammunition and land them without fear os they ore the master i of the area between Suwoiq and Khoburoh. xxxixKXMidxggitifUEX There is a regular caravan traffic between Shmos and Deboi and all sort of goods are brought to Shinos and the neighbourhood by land. T -Iso heard that the ^edouins of Ibri, a town in the Bhohirah, purchase arms at Debai and sell them openly in the bazaar of the town (Ibri). Thus it would appear that the Baluchis of ekron who are dealing in arms con purchase their requirements through their agents and carry them in their boats to ^tfkron whenever they find suitable4 This con cosily be carried out along the Batinah and Shamaliyeh coast os the Customs Mudir with one Askari cannot keep a look out for the whole coast. 1 - ^ [Confidential&gt; ©) express LETTER. jjrom Politicalj ^-uscat# To political resident, Bushire.

This badan, accompanied by two others captained respectively by Siuhtaj (alias Ismail) -nd ,\bdur nahim, left toatrah at sundown on 2 nd uecemoer and * sailed for a spot near Qorm where the shore party already West of Darsait* referred to met them. 3. The latter had brought several gunny bag bunules with them wnich were transferred from the shore by small hooris belonging to the badan. *he agent estimates that eight such bundles were brought inboard on Jangian's badan. These bundles had been brought on camels from Wadi Simael and in course of transit had been concealed under loads of firewood. Agent is somewhat vague as to size or total number of bundles but states that they all contained rifles of various patterns, some being ten-shot, some 5-shot and others single loaders. He sumised this, having later on seen one of the packages burst open xxzxix partially displaying the contents. He thinks total number of rifles must have been in region of 300 with certain amount of ammunition. n e learned that prices paid varied from £ 20-60. Pattern of rifles is unknown. 4 . T he badans having loaded up set sail the same night and hugging the coast till north of 3ib, eventually made2 . naole for K.uch which they reached the following night. The agent states that Kueh lies £ day's march west of has utaidani and between the latter and dugesar. huch contains a few fishermen's huts and tne inhaoitants live by fishing and bartering. 5 . The cargo was landed inmiediately on arrival ana apparently camels from the interior which had been Kept hanay for the purpose, at once loaned up and departed under cover of uarkness. 6 . My informant states that subsequently, whilst on snore, he saw a party of wezamis (military) arrive in the village. ! he states that such parties occasionally patrol the coast between and Cbarbur. 7 . .qcccoraing to the informant, the venture w..s ran aj Ahmad shah with sixteen companions who owned the baaans employed for the purpose. They left hue* a month ago ana as already related 8 men of the party were sent ashore to proceed to Wadi Simael. The shore party however actually left on its mission about 18th November and not as previously related# 3 . I consider tne main facts of the informant's story to be correct but as he is very ignorant and not over-gifted with intelligence it is difficult to asses the approximate correctness of the number of arms shipped, iaking into consideration local and other circumstances I doubt if the consignment consisted of more than 200 weapons at the most, and it was more probably half this number. 9 . Meanwhile the agent referred to in my C/274 PfTa * returned from the Batinah on 9th instant. He travelled as far as ahinas but although he was able to collect a certain amount of useful information concerning sailing craft plying between the Batinah, 'ebai and ^ekran and other information, he nowhere found any trace of arms smuggling out of the country.

In continuation of my No.C/286 of 11 th December 19d4 lolloping is synopsis of the information collected by my a&amp;ent to the ^tinah (vide my C/274 of 4th December para 9). «si. ihis agent proceeded as far as chinas and visited B&amp;rkah, Audam, ^asna * ah, ^uwaiq, isiiadurah, daham, doii.ar, Hasafain and ^ur el Ibri (5 miles north of Hasafain). .^o trace was any where obtainable of arms being trafficked, though certain areas and circumstances afford ample scope. I 3. (a) Suwadi island, off Barkuh, is commonly used by Baluchi sailing craft as an anchorage whilst awaiting favourable winus. (b) At Aidam it was learned that a Persian Baluch chief named fruhim had been settled for some time at rdiadhrah. he owns many craft which constantly ply with ~ekran. Morad Khan, also a petty Baluch chief, whilst not actually settled at Khadhrah and owning no craft, constantly travels backwards and forwards to ^ekran. (c) Both the above, together with the local Baluch population, are on excellent terms with Bheikh namad bin Bilal al Ba^di of knadhrah and import slaves for him from i ekran. The influence of the muscat Government in this area is purely nominal. (d) The powerful Yal Ba'ad tribe inhabiting the Jiatinah between Buwaiq and khaburuh own a number of large dhows which ply with Africa, Bocotra, southern Arabia, A rucial Coast and Basrah, as in practice they ignore the Muscataovernment and are their own aiasters in all but name they could indulge in illicit traffic at liberty. (e) The following Baluchis of w»ur el ibri constantly ply between that port, Oebai and Mekrani- Lai Baksh a/o Mohanmad who owns a boom with one mast. * W H Jolly boat n Ahmad s/o Isa n boom w Hussain s/o Hahlmdad W m n Haji Ahmad s/o Mohammad M tt N Khudadad Ali tt bagharah tt Their chief port of call i* Mekran is Sirik (not traceable) They return empty from Mekran.

Iheir usual practice is to send advance parties by land as far as Khor I'akkan* Their ostensible object is to purchase cows which are collected en route to khor Takkan where Uiey embark them in their own craft for ^ekran. Their chief port of call is badaich in i^ekran, from whence they return empty. 4. Bedowins of Ibri (approximately 75 miles south west of Khaburah) regularly purchase arms from debai and these are sold openly in Ibri. it would be possible for Baluchis to effect purchases there f though no evidence is available of them having done so hitherto. 5. A regular caravan route exists between chinas and ~ebai and every kind of commodity is impprted into the former place from the latter. No clue was procurable as to whether alias are thus brought in or not and the ineffectiveness of the customs control here f as throughout the datinah, prevents any attempt at surveillance or check. 4.

The Chinas area is at present Deing subjeetedL to a considerable an^unt of raiding at the lianas of the Ban! ^atabj ^ani All and Ban! kalban and the local inhabitants fear that any moment a descent may be made on chinas itself, The above three tribes are also engaged in a tribal quarrel with the ial da*ad and consequently dLl caravans are moving heavily armed* ?• The agent employed in the present instance is a member of this agency's staff and the information gathered can be regarded as reliable. major, xolitical ^gent and H.B.M'a consul,Muscat*CONFIDENTIAL.

The importation was alleged to have been made by the ’’Khan of Bemishk”. No corroboration of this report was obtainable on local enquiry. INFORMATION&gt; 2# A Persian Baluch, resident in Matrah, reported to the Commander of H.M.S.”Fowey M (in the absence of the Political Agent) on the 16th November that two badans had visited certain Batinah ports and collected a miscellaneous selection of arms which had been sold to Abdul Hussain H Chief of Ramsik” (vide preceding paragraph). The informant was very vague and gave no indication of the arms, the vendors, or dates and his report appears to have been based entirely on hearsay. In early December a small miscellaneous collection of arms is believed to have been exported from the coast near Kuram. Probable number of arms sixty to an hundred. These were landed at Kuch in Persian Baluchistan. INV LSTIGATIQN« 3 , (i) From very careful investigation, by a reliable agent deputed for the purpose early in De cember, no trace of trafficking in arms could be found throughout the Batinah, with the exception of that mentioned in the immediately preceding paragraph} and neither the confidential co-operation of the Muscat State Authorities, nor other endeavours by this ;.r.- 2 - ■ Agency have revealed any activity in arms traffieking from Muscat territory to date. (ii) The late Sarhadadar of British Mekran, who is an intimate friend of the Political Agent, in formed him emphatically in Mid-January that no arms were run from Muscat territory, hut that he had heard of arms being despatched from Dibai to Persian territory. He could not state quantities or types but said that such arms were believed to be of old pattern. (iii) iVo arms have been run by German steamers as far as it has been possible to ascertain. OPINION OF P.A, 4* X am of the opinion that *- (i) mp traffic in arms, as such, is going on from the Oman through Muscat territory to Persia. (ii) whereas a few arms may have and may still be purchased locally,no consignments of any appreciable quallity have been shipped or are available for export from Muscat! Oman. (iii) From the evidence of the arms that are usually seen on the Batinah Coast, or in the possession of Omanis, no weapon likely to be sold is of modern type. (iv) Provided the Muscat Government can rely on its subordinates, secret instructions might be issued to certain Walis to watch for any incident of arms trafficking. This cannot be done at present as the Sultan^ representative states that he has no one on whom dependance can be placed. Beyond this quiet surveillance I cannot visualise the adoption of any active measures by the Muscat State, whose resources for this purpose in the Batinah are in inverse ratio to the State*s administrative impotence in that area. Should it be possible for the State to organis% l 1 I .1 t Pi both a strict watch and the rapid transmission of news to Muscat it might be possible (should traffick ing commence) for dhows to be intercepted by the Royal Navy.

There ia a brisk trade going on for the purchase of ammunition in the country; at the present time prices are the highest attained for some years past being to rounds of .303 English ammunition per dollar, while the .403 Le Gras ammunition costs 3 rounds per dollar. Most of the ammunition appears to come from Beihan by way of Yemen, but it is believed that the A1 Adhin hostages obtained a certain amount from iAukaiia. A close watch is being kept on them now and a letter from one of the prisoners to his tribe seems to support the fact that there is still some illicit dealing going on in the town. Some of the A1 Adhm possessed 1941 British ammunition which may have been obtained from Somaliland: Sultan Abdullah hi n Muhsin states that a Somali offered to sell him 10,000 rounds of British ammunition a few roonths back. Italian rifles and ammunition have also made their apparition on the Wahidi market but the bedus do not think much of them, they consider the rifles are not strong and there is a large percentage of duds among the Italian rounds.m * i CONFIDENTIAL.

The two brothers go in a Badan to Masirah and bring all what Harndan can get from Masirah* A Suri named Musallem bin Hamad Walad El-Htmiaish informed me that’Hamdan bin Sulaiman wanted to sell to him about 7000, rounds of ammunitions* The informant di^d not buy them and they were subsequently sold to Awlad Haider* Rounds of ammunitions pistols, rifles are publicly sold in Masxrah Sur. I can say £hat there are at ’ present more than 50000 rounds in Sur and these are other than those which ha«calready been exported to Oman and other places* E In addition to this there came more than 25000 rounds of ammunitions from Mombasa and were exported to Oman » immediately. ‘ ' - V ?- 4ft.

Article 11 of the International Arms Convention of 1919 reads as follows M The State shall carry out all supervision and police measures within territorial waters in the prohibited areas and zone '* 3. Article 12 reads n With in the prohibited areas and maritime zone no native vessel of less than 500,tons burden shall te allowed to ship, discharge or tranship arms or ammunition. No cargoes of arms or ammunition fna^l be shpped on the vessels specified above without a specia l licnece, which shall contain all details necessary t© establish the nature and quantity of the items of the shipment, the vessel which the shipment is loaded, the name oi the ultimate consignee and the poi'ts of loading and discharge .

The follovidng is the gist of remarks by Naval Officer in Charge, Honituz on a report of H.K.S. Billow* s recent visit to Sur and is forwarded for your information : - The information from 'Billow’s' interpreter (passed verbally to you) suggests that over 50,000 rounds of ammunition have been pilfered from Masirah during the last 12 months, and that the Coolie Master, Masirah, is the head agent at the R.A.P. Camp while his father, living at Muscat, is the 'King Pin'. Captain Strawbridge remarks that the Yiti Caves, about 15 miles below Muscat, have given grounds for suspicion for some time, he is not acquainted with the caves but understands that the approach by ship is awkward and suggests, in view of the short distance from Muscat, that you might be able to make investigations there by motor dhow or overland. He considers that dhows, motor or otherwise, land their illicit cargoes at Shinas, Kalba, El Fujaira, Khor Fakkan or Dibah, or even ports further South and reiaarks that he is interested to see from your C961/17 June that you share his views. He does not think that large amounts of contraband are carried in any one vessel, but that they take small quantities which can be well hidden and moved quickly from place to place on shore under cover of darkness, even under the very noses of our 'friendly collaborators' at such ports as Shinas. Also that all these villages require replenishment of ammunition and rifles from time to time.1944 a7 Rtftrwi,, your on(iora*m.nt lfo^/868 dot.d th* 6th July 1944* /Wording to Inquires mad* th* launch r*f#rr*d to h*long*d to th* Shaikh of Oubsi.

'jii i v V&gt; ‘ s “’' at Bushire ,ii io&lt;m Extracts from a report received frn the 7th September. 1944. 1. Arms and ammunition are being imported regularly along the Persian coast between Asalu and Kangan, both Persian dhows from the ports of Dakhti, Tangistan and Dashtistan, and Arab craft, being engaged in these smuggling activities. Very few rifles are imported from Bahrain and Kuwait but the majority come from Sharjah, Kho r Fakkan, the Batinah coast, Dubai and Muscat^. Owing to scarcity of arms in those ports, the Arabs are engaged in purchasing rifles from the Bedouin tribes and arms are brought up to Oman and Sharjah from Suriya, Llakalla and Seihut (between Aden and Salalah) for subsequent export to Persia, a resident of Mahra who was recently seen at a Persian port, has stated that a certain broker named Ahmas bin Abdullah bin Afrar of Seihut, is engaged in this arms traffic — shaikh Salim bin Kharais of Sharjah who is related to Shaikh Sultan, the Zambit of Sharjah, is involved in this arms smuggling. 2. The following dhows recently brought arras to the P e r s i an coast * (i) 5th August 1944, NakhMa Mohammad Abaid originally from Kangan but now residing at Kuwait, sold some cartridges to the wife of Shaikh Abdur Rasul Nasuri and returned to Kuwait. (ii) 10th August 1944, Nakhuda Hasan bin Rashid of Bahrain who previously sold some rifles to Shaikh Sulaiman Nasuri and Shaikh Nasir, has guaranteed to bring a further supply of ammun ition. (iii) Shaikh Abdullah bin Hammad A1 Khalifeh of Rifah (?) (East of Bahrain) with one Seyyed Ali who previously import ed arms to Banadir-i-Salas, left Asalu on the 7th August, and is arranging for Seyyed Ali to proceed to Sharjah after the month of Ramazan, to purchase more arras. (iv) 18th August 1944, a dhow named tr Buggara”, Nakhuda, Ibrahim Fakhru. a relative of Mohammad Ubaidan Fakhru of Qatar, arrived at Tahire and subsequently went to Asalu and Turabak, brought with him 15 ! Virnadil(?)* rifles worth Rials 3000 each and 5 ordinary Mausers (5 shot), with about 50 cartridges, and sold the whole{consignment. This man is a regualr trafficer in Arras. t ; (v) Dhows from Oman calling at Persian ports normally carry rifles for self protection, and a proportion of these are invariably sold in Persia. (vi) A consignment of 800 cartridges arrived at Asalu a few months ago for Shaikh Nasir from the ports of Tangistan and Dashtistan. This ammunition originated from Abadan. (vii) 1st September 1944, Nakhuda Abud(?) in a dhow named 'Sarabuk' arrived at Asalu from an Arab port near Dubai, with a consignment of 30 rifles. 3. The chiefs at all the ports in the Bandir-i-Salas such as Shaikh Abdur Rasul Nasuri, Shaikh Nasir, Shaikh Sulaiman and their followers, are fully equipped with arms and ammunitions and are believed to hold aoproximately 500 rifles. Similarly the Razrai family in Dashti, Dorab Khan of Dashtistan and their follow ers, are well armed, and it is believed that they have secured rrr most of their rifles and ammunition from the Arab coast.

As regards paragraph 1 ; Arms smuggling from Khor Fakkan has been the subject of correspondence between this Agency and the Naval Authorities since June of this year. Investigations have brought nothing definite to light. As regards the general term Batinah, we have no information but the coast seems remote from any source of supply. It is not thought that dealing goes on actually in Muscat. 4 , As regards paragraph 2(v) : We have no information as to whether the arms carried for protection are sold or not. If so preventive action would be called for in Persia. I do not think it possible to institute a register of arms carried on dhowstto check the actual arms with the register.

LV. u Extract from Lingah Memorandum No. 111-25/1, dated May 9th, 1945. 7# In this connection It may be pointed out that the crews of Arab countrycraft carry arms and ammunition ostensibly for the purpose of self-defence against raid ers along the Persian and/or Arab coast. It Is difficult for the Persian officials to keep a check on this as the nakhodas do not carry any documents to cover such weapons which can be easily disposed of. A case in point arose in Lingah a few months ago. It was reported to me that a boat from Dubai had a couple of rifles on board and the Consular Agent Informed the Director of Customs per sonally, and requested the latter to have a searcn made. This was done and the weapons were traced. The Consular Agent requested the Director of Customs to force the nakhoda to obtain a permit from his Euler or Customs officials on the production of which the arms could be returned. This was accordingly done. It is therefore suggested, if there is no objection, that the Rulers of the Arab States be requested to instruct their subjects that in case they are forced to carry arms in self- defence they must obtain permits which should be produced to Persian Customs or other officials. Even this procedure will not, in my humble opinion, prevent the traffic owing to the long coast line and lack of supervision unless the Rulerr enforce the return of the permits with the arms etc., which could be stored until they set out again. A registration system may check the smuggling to a certain degree.tsam NoS.l My dear fi Wo dated the ternal Af the sale 2.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No.1741» dated the 1st, December, 1945 on the subject cited above and to give below a review of the arms traffic in the Muscat area. 2. Owing to war time difficulties in maintaining naval patrols, an increase in arms traffic was to have been expected. Although prior to 1944&gt; there was little or no evidence to show that this was the case, the Muscat Government, as a precautionary measure, issued a notification in 1943 prohibiting the export of arms and laying down that the owner of any vessel found carry ing arms without a permit would be severely punished and the arms confiscated; travellers who wished to carry arms when leav ing the country were required to obtain an arms permit. In 1944, however, reports were received from a number of sources which seemed to indicate that arms traffic had begun to increase. The first of these reports came from the Baluchistan Administra tion (Memorandum No.94-P-15/44, dated the 9th. February, 1944 from the Eon’ble the Agent and Governor-General in Baluchistan to the Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi) and alleged that gun running between Muscat ports and the ports of Jask and Charbar on the Iranian coast was taking place. Later, reports were also received alleging the smuggling of arms to Mekran, principally through men of the R.AF. Levies proceeding on leave. Although no positive evidence was obtained from the ensuing enquiries, the very high prices offering in Iran for guns of any sort makes it probable that an increase in this traffic took place. Local information pointed to Suwaik on the Batinah^and Trucial Coast ports, as being the collecting centres. 3- While it does not seem that during 1944, gun running in modern weapons was taking place, there was evidence to show that considerable quantities of small arms ammunition were being received at Muscat ports and re-exported. There is no doubt that ammunition stolen from R.A.F. stocks at Masirah-4 \ - 2 - and Salalah (c.f. Muscat telegram No.C/671, dated the 3rd* May, 1944) was being traded at Sur and it appears to have been fairly well established that ammunition from East Af rica, and in particular from Mombasa, was also being received and re-exported at this port. As reported in Muscat tele gram No. C/893, dated the 7th. June, 1944i *303 service am munition became available in the Muscat and Mutrah bazaars. A small quantity of tracer and other ammunition was recovered by the Muscat Government vide Muscat telegram No.C/937, dated the 15th. June, 1944* In May 1944, N.O.IX., Hormuz re ported that a Muscat dhow carrying a small quantity of Bri tish and American ammunition had been intercepted. 4. During the year 1945. there has been nothing to show that arms dealing has been carried on to any important ex tent in Muscat territory. In April and May 1945, a search for small arms ammunition, alleged to have been smuggled o\it of India in chests of tea, was made by the Military and Naval authorities at Las Bela ports, Gwadur and ports on the Mekran coastline; but so far as is known, the search of suspected cargoes did not result in any recoveries being made. My personal enquiries into this case at Gwadur, the result of which was reported to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in my letter No.C/782-l4f/l3&gt; dated the 19th. May, 1945, revealed no grounds for believing that organisation for the passage of military stores on a large scale existed there From the evidence available, it appears therefore 5 that in 1944, there was some increase in the passage of fire arms from Muscat to the Iranian coast and a considerable increase in the passage of small arms ammunition. During 1945, this increase appears to have anded and in recent months, there has been no evidence of any activity in the trade of arms and ammunition. I have the honour to be.

The Baluch in Oman were the main arm dealers smuggling arms from Dubai to Persia. This was due to the good relations between the Baluch of the Batinah coastal towns in Oman and the Baluch of Mekran [Makran] in the Persian Gulf. A certain Nasir bin Beitlah, a Baluch of Matrah, acted as the broker of the Baluch traders. The Baluch at Mekran were also importing slaves from there to Oman. Guns were also shipped to Oman from other areas including, Mukalla, Karachi and certain regions in East Africa.The volume also includes a number of reports related to arms trafficking in Sohar and Suwaiq. The reports were sent from the assigned collector of customs in those regions to the Political Agency, Muscat. Other reports were related to the seizure of arms by the Muscat Government.Upon the request of the British Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muscat, issued a public announcement regarding arms trafficking in which the Muscat Government announced eight main points for the public to commit to. The volume also includes correspondence between the Political Agency, Muscat, and Shahab bin Faisal al-Bu Sa‘idi, regarding the International Arms Convention of 1919.Among other correspondents in the volume are: the Political Residency, Bushire; the Chargé d’Affaires, British Legation, Tehran; and the Political Agency, Bahrain.Folios 277-290 are file notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00029e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
