Min telegram No.11. Secret My telegram No. 58 Conversations with Ibn Saud and his advisers in Riyadh over last four days have followed closely on’ lines set out in my telegram under reference. They have turned chiefly on questions of supplies, transport and finance. 2. Until this orning Hafiz V/ahba and Yusuf Yasin were present at all conversations and on one occasion also Amir Saud. 3. This • orning however Ibn Saud wished to talk to me privately and confidentially. Conversation lasted for nearly two hours and turned around above-mentioned questions. 4. Finally Ibn Saud staed he was very dissatisfied with fin ancial. control in the country and begged that His Majesty's Government.would at once send a Government Financial.expert to this country to re-organise financial structure and establish it on a firm oasis. As most of work will have to be done in Mecca he requested that expert chosen should be a Moslem of Sunni persuasion. He had no doubt such an expert could be found in British territory and he attached greatest importance to his early selection and arrival. He begged that His Majesty's Government did not disappo nt him in this to. him, most important matter. 5. Please see my immediately following telegram regarding his second request. ( Copies sent to Mr. Smyth) (CYPHER) DEPART; E NTAL. PC .2 stated that he had appointed Amir.Mansur, one of his sons as FROM RIYADH TO FORMIGF OFFICE. Mr. Jordan No. 7 2nd March, 1944.

In the course of confidential interview Ibn Saud&amp; u S' Corarnander-in-Chief .Saudi Arabian Army, He had every confidence in Llansur, v;ho was both intelligent and loyal. He knew little of army matters, however,'nor did Saudi Arabian officers. For this reason he requested that His ajesty’s Government would send a senior military expert accompanied by four or five capable officers representing the different branches of the Service to Saudi Arab a to train and establish his small army on sound modern lines. 2. As in the case of financial expert he attached greatest importance to this matter and sincerely hoped His Majesty's Government would accede to his request. .He did ;Ot wish His Majesty's Government to take away officers serving with the fighting forces but considered some reserve officers or some incapacitated and unfit for active service would be most suitable. He again requested that they should be Moslems of Sunnir persuasion and begged for their early nomination and arrival in this country. 3. He added that He knew the Americans were prepared to train his army and had even offered to do so but that he did not wish to let them do this. His faith was in his Majesty's Government and the British and he looked, to us for the assistance both in financial and military latters which le now requires.

Min : c.13 II I.EDM .TE EECi ^MT My telegrams Nos 6 and 7 to you. I cannot stress too strongly the importance which Ibn Gaud attached to his request (group undec.? for) financial and military experts. A refusal on the part of His Majesty's Government to either or both of these requests would cause him grave disappointment. 'He realises that United States ould like to take over training of army and its officers but he neither wishes their interference in internal administration of the country nor can they supply Moslem officers. 2. He has for some time past realised the rottenness of the financial administration of the country. ' It is like date palm wood/^', he said ' whereas I wish it to be as sound as steel and only the British can help me in this respect.' 3. I venture to hope.that in the best interests of the country and our friendly relations with Ibn Sard.you will accede to his request. 4. I did not want to raise the question of payment for these services and suggest that in view of financial penury of the country we should shoulder the burden at present. ( Copies sent to r.
