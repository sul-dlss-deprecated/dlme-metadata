The file includes copies of direct correspondence between Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ, the ruler of Kuwait and British officials regarding Mubārak's desire for British protection and the nature of Kuwait's relationship with the Ottoman Empire.The correspondence also discusses the rivalry and conflict between Shaikh Mubārak (and his tribal allies including the Al Saud) and the ruler of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar and head of the Rashidi tribal dynasty, Abdul Aziz Ibn Mitab [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin Mit‘ab]. The desire of Abdul Rahman Bin Feysal El Saood [‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] to be made a 'protege' of the British government is also discussed as is the possibility of establishing a post office in Kuwait (and recruiting a native agent to serve the British there).The file contains a number of reports (in their original Arabic, with English translations attached) concerning political affairs in Kuwait that were written by Ali bin Ghulam Reza, a news agent in Kuwait employed by the British.A section of correspondence in the file relates to the arrrest, by Ottoman authorities, of Shaikh Mubārak's agent in Bussorah [Basra], Abdul Aziz El Salim [‘Abd al-‘Azīz al-Sālim]. El Salim was accused of being a subscriber to
                           Khilafat, an Arabic newspaper published in London said to be critical of the Ottomans. Transcripts of El Salim's interrogation are contained in the file in Arabic (folios 179-180) and English (folios 183-85).A rough sketch chart of Kuweit [Kuwait] Fao [Al Faw] M'Gussa [Umm Qasr] and surrounding country is contained in the file on folio 82.An intelligence report summarising recent events in Nejd written in May 1902 by Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, J G Armstrong is contained on folio 282.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c0#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c0#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
