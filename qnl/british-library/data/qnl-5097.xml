Slr f 1 hare the honour to report as follows with regard to the events happening at Bahrain connected with the recent nurdere which occurred in the Lrry Corps there. 2. When I arrived in Bahrain on the ilth Auguet, H.M.S. * CYC L .a MKK h was alrefrdy there* I found that on her arrivaly she had landed at Major Daly's request, an armed guard of four bluejackets for the Agency, where there was however, still an armed guard of the Levy Corps, and also armed watch men engaged by the police* The situation at ths itort was that the man accused of murdering the Subedar was in jail under sustody of the Levy Corps, who were in possession of their arms and ammunition in the ordinary way* There were three remaining Indian Army Instructors (H*C*0 , s), wt» were also still at the i 'ort, where parades went on as usual, and Mr* Belgrave, the financial Adviser, visited almost daily* 3* H.M*S.'TRIAD' arrived the next day and on the 13th plans were concerted for a force of bluejackets to land and take possession of all arms and ammunition in the Fort* Your permission was received late that night, and early on the 14t} a party landed from the ships, armed and with Lewis Guns, marched up to the ^ort, and took possession of all anas and ammunition* There was no difficulty in this, as the Levy Corps were perfectly quiet, and tne bluejackets withdrew leavin| one officer and an armed guard of twelve men* Subse* quently to this there has been no trouble among the men of thi Levy Corps, who have done their ordinary parades, but without anss, and have been allowed out of the iTort during the hours between sunrise and sunset, more or leas at will* 4* 'The men accused of the murder of the Subedar and of the Chief tChief of ^oXio« 9 and also the Leyy Corps Mullah, »ero then placed on hoard the Haral Shlpe for safety, and I at once pro- eeeded with the trial of the murderer of the Suhedar. Haying disposed of that oase X dealt with those oonnweted with the attempt on the life of the Chief of ^olioe* &amp;• After this I took up, at a^jor Daly^ requestp a oase against a man, who had written an anonymous letter threaten* ing certain people with being murdered by a Secret Society said to exist* 6. I might add, in amplification of prewious details which you hare in your possession! that the attempt on the Chief of Balioe was uneuocessful* One assailant seised the Chief of Police 9 b companion and held him down, while the other fired two shots at the Chief of Police from one side. One grased the flesh of the upper abdomen, Just below the ribs, furrow* ing the flesh without penetrating it f and Imooicing him down and the other hit a pocket book in his breast pocket and scorched his coat without inflicting any other injury on him than to knock him down again. ?• Am regards the lion-Commissioned Officers of the Levy Corps, there remain three Indian Army Kon*CoBmissioned Officers f as I hare noted aboTe. One Z beliewe is oTerdue for leare, another has a good claim to leawe, and all three^ are I understand too frightened to wish to remain longer in Bah rain. Z fancy that their retention would be in the best interests ef no one. As regards the Baluch 1 I.C.0 v b 9 I em told that they hare been rery completely unsuccessful. The fact that such an unsatisfactory character as the murderer of the Subedar eould ever hare been made even a paid lance-naik shows that they were hard mp for men likely to make good V .c.0 *8.

Dated the 2Cth August 1926 • Your telegran 1465/s. I have no meane of proceeding to Bahrain before August 25th by mail oteamer or August Slst by 'Lawrence'. But Homer has Just returned and 1 understand situation clearly enough. It was essential that Homer, as Sessions Judge, should go initially to try the murderer and my accompany* ing him seemed superfluous. He has completed the trials of the murderer and of two Baluoh policemen who slightly wounded Chief of Police, Trial of Hullah is deferred pending result of reference to Baghdad about Turkish and Bolcharan documents found with him* 1 learn from Homer that — (1) Baluoh guard at Political Agency continued to function quietly after the outrage. (2) Belgrave daily Tisited the Ifort and conducted ^ his enquiries there. (3) Hurderer was arrested by Indian H.C.O. as soon as he saw that the man had put away his rifle. (4) Murderer and the two assailants of Police Officer were kept in custody of the Leyy Corps until bluejackets took over the ^ort 56 hours after the arrival of TRIAD. (5) Since then the Baluchls have attended parades regularly and performed routine duties,such as ward of ciYil convicts 9 though armed with staves inetead of riflei (6) Townspeople have begun to attribute robberies U to Corps but Homer doee not believe them. On-2- ! On the other hand, there le no doubt that — (1) Mullah poisoned the minds of a large number of Lerles against Subedar and Indian ft.C,()'•« He may be a HuBclan \ Agent and hare done more harm than we know 9 (2) There was previously a talk of murderer cutting hie name and Mullah said all must follow hie lead. (5) No Levies showed or dared to show regret about the outrage. (4) Two-thirds of the men complete their period of engagement next February and will not renew it. (6) Three instructors are not worth retaining. In the circumstances I am inclined to recommend that Levy Corps be abolished and a mixed force of armed police substituted for it. Baluchis are notoriously traffickers in arms. In view of the fa^t that the foreign element under British jurisdiction is so large in Bahrain, I think it would be well to import as quickly as possible a contingent of Indians (including as many ex-policemen as possible) to man the 5*0 rt and the Agency guard-room. A beginning might be made with 50 • Perhaps Major Barrett who is in Karachi can aasist in recruiting them. They would be under ciwil law and an Englishman would command the whole police force. I can order Daly to deport at least 40 Baluchis to Fasni by steamer of August a6th and possibly can arrange for another steamer to call the following week for the remainder. Or if a man-of-war escorts the mail, the whole Corps can probably be deported at once. After the departure of the fealuchis the Shaikh^ persona] retainers should be able to maintain order for the few weeks pending arrival of Indian police. One man-of-war, I hope, will be near till then. If I went to Bahrain I could only try to sort the sheep from the goats, a very difficult task and I think,not worth attempting.Telegram R. From H.M f s j-olitical Resident, Bushire. To Government of India, F.&amp; i 3 . Dept., Simla. No. D.0.521. Dated the 21st August 1926. D emi-Officia l. My telegram of August 20th, Bahrain. Baluch Levies are now confined to 'barracks at night under eye of Naval guard. If town police have been supplemented 'by extra night watchmen it seems unlikely that burglaries will continue. I can transfer my headquarters office to Bahrain for a month or two if desired, but at great inconvenience and expense in the matter of housing. Alternatively 1 can order Horner to remain there for some weeks. He will have to return to try the Mullah probably. This also would interfere with Bushire work greatly. I do not consider the situation at Bahrain as serious after the Baluchis have gone. if Geake had been there we might have been able to retain a fair number of them, but no one else knows the men. Geake unfortunately was rather a failure otherwise I would have asked for him back. RESIDENT. 's.»1 \ i CDNFID^TtAL. ' U No.343-S of 1926.

For a moment 1 was still at a loss to understand the situation when I felt fllight pain at the left of the heau and put up my hand to find a lump out of my ear and a good deal of blood. As there were windows on all sides «■&gt; all barred but open ~ ana 2 was absolutely exposed* 1 then also Jumped into a window alcove which would afford cover from the left* whence I imagined the bullet haci come.

He was then outalde the window I was in and for all Z knew had no re ammunition and could shoot me through the bars. Z therefore determined, as a last effort, to rush him, hoping he would lose his nerre. 1 « accoxdIng.ly yelled at him and rushed to the door* he also, howeTor« ran at zae and act me before Z was down the two steps to the tfr^und level. Z tried to seise his rifle and shouted to 3 the guard (who liaa however, 1 af^erviurUB found, ficd to a nanSI), 'but ^ot atuoic in the forearm doin® it, turned i^y foot on the steps and fell. He Jabbed at me hurriedly several times before I could rise, but Z had rattled him and he put no 'go' into it or Z should not be writing this letter.

There is attached to the Levy Corps a sort of Mullah to lead the prsyen OriginalIjr they had a well known arid perfectly harmless indi vidual, who recigucd and left Bahrain, rfhen 1 went on leave lust year they had no one. when this new individual was taken on 1 have x*o idea* I only discovered his existenoe two days before this event anu intended to enquire about him. It appears that when Nius Ali's funeral was being arranged the leading Indians thoght they ought to ask the Corps ^wPah to perforxa the ceremonies, lie apparently accented half ly and they allege tried to scajqp parts of the service and had to be kept up to it. They were all a bit taken aback at this. On the way back to the *ort the Jfullah remarked! 'There is no great cause to mourn Bias Ali. Some people forget the for the material benefits of this world'. Asked what he meant he said (this is the vereiun of Jir.Ashraf, a highly educated and well known Indian lioslem) i 'He was always running the men in for little offences. I asked him not to report the mvtter of the revolver, but he would do it'; and eomething about 'Ifoslims ought to hang together ,, • Another vereion (but se hand) was that his actual words were| ' hat did he mean by i to be punished by a Kafir'. AShrafMi 4- ABhraf is of course also a Sunnl Uuslio^f XUce the Mullah and so are all the other Indian* who were with him and apparent ly are veady to c : fix* what he aaye. ABhraf alao mentions that the Mullah onoe comp lined that iliaa All and the Ina true tore did i not pray behind Uia c but preferred to do it on their own. Further enquiries tend to show that it aay be proved that the rev Ircr the oulprit had (but did not use to shoot us » it had been taken from him, and he used his serrioe rifle) was not long ago the property of the Uullah; and it appears that the aooused in indebted to the Mullah and has Mortgaged everything he has to hia. 1 have purposely not pressed enquiries too far 9 im as it is/possible to guage how nuoh influence the nan msy have got over these Baluchi p , ana it night precipitate a row. Ashraf is enphatio that the *ullah should be deported as he is a fanatio. It seene questionable whether he should not be put on trial* It was on discovering this situation that 1 wired for His M«jesty 9 B £hip* The whole plaoe is of course Jumpy 'he baeaar promptly closed (now open again); and people bolted everywhere, and the Agenqy servants started reporting suspicious .

Dated and received the 14th August 1926. PRIORITY . Your telegram No.503. Arrival of first man-of-war had quieting effect on town and levies, and effectively prevented any further trouble. Arrival of second man-of-war was expected, as everyone knew that owing to Political Agent being involved in outrage Government must take strong action. There are no Baluchi officers and only eleven Baluchi non-commissioned officers. Three Indian Instructors remain and can be relied on, but are naturally in a blue funk and pressing to get away on any pretext. There are 27 Muscat Baluchis in the Corps: they have been disarmed with all the other men of the Levy Corps in Fort (there are three small posts outside, which will be disarmed shortly) and will be sent away by next down mail with men in Police. Third man-of-war unnecessary and not available. Present naval force sufficient to deal with situation. Shaikh can get on with Police force, which is now increased by recruiting of Persians, as long as man-of-war remains deterring criminals and preventing further Shiah-Sunni riots; but man-of-war cannot remain for ever, and Senior Waval Officer says that in view of possible demands on the Naval squadron in other parts of the Gulf it is desirable that the Levy Corps be replaced by a reliable force as soon as possi ble in order to free ships. We all feel that the temporary despatch to Bahrain of an Indian Infantry detachment from Karachi.Karachi is essential to maintain order, while the future composition of the Levy Corps is under consideration. Increase of armed burglaries very marked this year, probably due to bad pearling season last year all over the Gulf and the consequent influx of undesirables in search of employ - ment or crime. At least one is occurring every night at present. This and the previous telegram shown to Senior Naval Officer and Political Agent. HORITER. M i if iTelegram P. From H.M's Political Resident, Bushire. Secretary to Hesident, Bahrain. 508. To Ho. Dated the 15th August 1926. Wholesale condemnation of Levy Corps practically involves similar action at Muscat and even raises doubts about Mekranis in British service. men who disliked Indian Officers would wish to rescue guilty comrade especially if influenced by hostile Mullah. But I am not satisfied that bulk of Corps will not return to duty recognizing justice of punishment of criminals. Officers fit for promotion, we should get some Baluch ex- officers from India: also that Shaikh should make strenuous effort to supply a small contingent of local Arabs and Bahrainis in the Corps, Levy Corps was primarily organized to protect Shaikh from attacks by his subjects,who had migrated to main land. This danger seems remote now, especially as it is known that Navy protects him. If Levies are converted to Armed Police force they need not be homogeneous. I gather that you will not be able to say what number of Baluchis are loyal unti trials are concluded. I hopr that you will find that the Hinds and men seht by Commandant, Mekran Levy Corps, are mostly innocent. Strong action should be taken by the Police against undesirable foreigners in the bazaar with a view to their expulsion.

Demi-official letter No®11047, dated the 13th September 1926, from the High Conmiasioner for Iraq, Baghdad, with enclosure. —D^O BO.100/9/1C- Bahrein, 25th Stptombor 1926. y Dear Colonel pridcaux, I hare found Major Daly's notes on his scheme for an armed police Force in lahrein and enclose a copy for your information. One of the Lce.Naikc of tht police porce, who was repatriated last month returned to Bahrein by last mail. I had him put before the mixed Court and then found that none of these men was deported. They were merely told that their serrices were no longer required and they were giyen their passages to Muscat or Gv /adur as the case might be. They were not warned lihat they were not to return to Bahrein. This is BelgraTe*s eTidence before the Court. In the circumstances it was impossible to proceed criminally against the man for doing what ke had mx nerer bcenjtold to refrain from doing. The man* s brothers and cousins, wife and other relatiyes are here. The sole Muscat relatiye was his father since deceased. The Shaikh would like the man to remain hero so I am getting Belgrare to make careful enquiries as to the man's antecedents and character.

Prideaux, There has 'been a little firing in the neighbourhood of Sanabis ao 1 have got Robinson to put a post there and inshallah there will now be peace. The headman carae to see me and swore that the attacks were instigated by old Ayesha, Shaikh Isa's wife, who he declared had also instigated the attack on Shaikh Hamad in the same neighbourhood. He stated definitely that the leaders of the attack were Shaikhs Ibrahim and Sulman the sons of IQialid al Khalifa, and that Sulman was the man who had been wounded and that he had died on 7th November, with the help of Shaikh Hamad I killed this last story by sending a Persian photographer to Dhaluf where the sons of Khalid line in exile, and he brought back a couple of photographs of them both hale and well. The Sanabis headman told me that the people of his village proposed to come in a body to take sanctuary round ^ the Agency flagstaff iWT nothing were done for them by the Bahrein State. I have atarred off this development for the present. Captain L.S.Parke arrived last night i.e. 13th Ifovernber and is going over to Muharraq to call on Shaikh Hamad this morning. He is staying with us for a da^ or two, while he collects his servants etc. The Hurphys have put off their visit till next week as the Roch's were expected in kuscat, I hope the lumbago is better.

J Have aiiy more ••deported' Baluchis been filtering back? I think you took a wrong view about the fact of deportation, in the first man's case. My official orders were to aeport Levies and Police. Apparently no officer, who might have done so, at the last moment lined the men up ana said to them 'Under orders of tne Britisn Government you are deported and are not to return'. But actually the Persian Police subordinates rounded the men up on the quay, said to them 'You have got to leave Bahrain and your passages have been paid for by the Government to Gharbar, Gwadur, Muscat or Pasni, as you may desire'. I thinK it is splitting straws to say that these men were not given to understand that they v/ere not to return. It is possible of course that a number of innocent men were expelled in the wnolesale operation. The settlement of each returning man^ case can be made on its merits. But bad characters should certainly not be allowed to remain. The old order in their case is stii.1 operative. Most of them were imported for State Service, and were properly repatriated when no longer required. Their remaining could only be allowed if their anticedents were sati sfactory,/• /K COOTIHSITTIAL. ^ih /o D.0.No,54i-S British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Busiiire, tne 20tia December 1926. llease refer to your D.O. letters Nos.0.i56/9/i0 and C.i4i/9/i0 about tne Indian Instructors. A aescription of tneir behaviour may be found in Horner^ telegram from Banrain, No.T.b, dated Ibth August 1926. One man is said to nave benaved in such cowardly fashion 'that ne must oe court-martialled if retained in service'. I was talking to two of the Indians, including the Q.uarter-Master-Havilaar, on the roof of the fort re the pending execution of the murderer and one said 'What is the use of executing him? It won»t bring Niaz Ali back to life'. I gathered from this that he was afraid of being detailed to ta^e part in the execution. I do not cavil at Belgrave taking them to Ixiuia, though I should have thought ne could have borrowed suitable policemen recruiters, but if most of tne new men are bnai - band of the three Instructors I thinic it is very unfortunate. If the new Policemen are really brave ana zealous, the old handj, who knew ana pernaps benefitted from Niaz Ali 1 s irregular practices, may in time lead them astray. Their only use,which I can see, is for tne identification of returning deportees. Please show this correspondence to Parke; He is now primarily responsible for the Police Corps* efficiency. Personally, I think, I would keep only one of the men and get rid of two. Ma J or C.C.vT. Barrett, C • S. -l ., C . I. . y Political Agent, Bahrain. yOlf/vCeLra*** U j U us. CT /WW; j .

To Major C.C.J, Barrett, G.S.I., C.I.U., Political -ugent, Bahrein, Shiraz. Sir, I submit a M«morandurn dated 22nd July 1928 from the Commandant, State Police, Bahrein and two petitions dated 23rd July 1928 handed in 'by Fazl Huaain, late clerk, Police Force, just before his departure to Indie.. As Captain Parke laid great stress on the report of his Superintendent Chowdhri Sultan Ahmed and expressed his apprehensions of a disturbance in the Port, I had to tell Pazl Husain to leave the next day which he did, on the 23rd July. I have reason to believe that this man has been dicch^.r ed chiefly on the instance of the Suprrir!terd'nt whose interested and malicious^were ^ive^ undue weight o nd credence by the Co^wmndant. Captain Prrke cr^e and saw thrice on Sunday, Leitwice, accompanied by Chowdhri Sultan ^hr^ad. Both, chiefly the Superintendent, spoke at length and the latte showed preat D.n::icty to do pway with Fa?l Husain immediately alle^inj jkhFfc' the possibility of imminent trouble in the Force. At first I thought the clerk should have an opportunity of putting in his own statement which he was particularly be^si^G 'to be allowed to do. He wanted to stay in the town, after being harshly bundled out of the Fort c^uite. suddenly in a day. Fe gave as his reasons, firstly, th^t he r 7ould put hie own statement in writing f whichwhich he vra^ted 8. few de-ys* time; secondly, that his wife hcid beeii ill ov/ing to abortion and was not quite fit to travel. The first ras met 'by a show of fear and appre- -li*nsion that trouble in the Force would be caused any day. The second reason was retort&amp;d by Captain Pa^V.c bringing a note from the American lady doctor saying th^t Pasl Husu.in f s wifs h^d been discharged from hospital a few days sgnx previously and was fit to travel^ unlc ^ — something had : ':on e wron^ with her cmce h^r disch^.r^e. As a matter of fact she did go with much trouble as I was sorry to learn afterwards from llurse Sundri Sin^h who saw her off on board, I refrain from saying anything about the allegations made in his petition by Fazl Ilusain. Prom all I have heard, I am personally con- -vinced that the Superintendent has taken the greatest pains to do away with a man who knew much about the colourable practices of the Superintendent, I may add that reports received since 'Pazl Husain's departure, from two or three of tlie Police Forco and some outsiders go to show that Gliowdri Sultan v Ahmad is abusing and threatening certain of the rank and file and, I am sorry to add, therti appears to be come danger of the force having some kind o:' dieturuancc or other. This is the more pittable when, as I clearly sec, the Commandant is cleverly and mischievously misled and petty wrongs continuously doneto the men simply because they were more or les^friendly to the late cler&gt; • I have the honour to be, Sir, Your yU)st obedient servant, Indian Assistant, Bahrein,\ Dear Major Barre't't, I - i asking de Grenier if he will be good enough to ta::e this jco you, and have explained the situation to him, as it is extremenly difficult to put it on paper. The )osition is very difficult, and, with Seyd oadiq Hassan actir^r; for ou here complicates things still more, as I very much regret to say oi-at I consider he is responsible to a certain extent, with others of course, ./or the present trouble. The break-up of the liuhunnnadan Brotherhood has been the cause oj . a certain restlessness which is now apparently shewing itself. A few weeks ago I confirmed my suspicions of discontent, and foud the root of the trouble was the Clerk, who was at once sent out of the Island. An effort wasmade by him to remain here, pleading the sickness of his wife, who had then already recovered, and travelled with him. Shortly afterwards, owing to gross insubordination and unsatisfactory conduct, I dismissed and sent away a Lance-naik, who said to the Superinteiide .t on the quay, as he was leaving: 'Be careful! There will be big trouble.' is, at the time was not considered of any importance. A few days ago, Sadiq Hassan came into the Government Office, and said he had heard there wfes discontent amongst the sepoys, and that the Superintendent was very unpopular; he further stated that he had received a letter witn about twenty names attached, complaining of the way they had been treatou oy nim. l asked him if he had the letter, and he produced it and read it at my request. I told him I did not believe it; but naturally I proceeded to investigate it on my own account, and as thouh by chance I ytroUeu into one of the rooms in which were some of the men whose names were on one list iri the letter. . I asked them if all was well, and they said yes; and one or two came forward and-say they had a petition and told me that they wished to complain against the Superintendent in regard to leave and rations' 7 ana on my invitation they told me briefly what the complaint was, and I said' * ' 0U ~1 0 ^ - { int0 it in the corning. That same evening at about four • p.m. the superintendent reported to me that about twenty sepoys asked to see tin ^ invited complaints, and every nan said every- , ^ + v 0 8a3r ',f ad ,' fc f n finished asked if he ted anything 7- ' result Ox the investigation I aa &gt;erfeotlv satisfied n0 00mplaint a - ainst the Superintendent. The r ret rae 8 1!l08t trivial . but convinced me at the same I ' , 87 08811 induced and inspired from outside to make 'fitnr'' SeVOral U5£aTt5ra0t0ry been seit I have at present one-fifth of the force, onleave, and at the moment cannot spare more, except on medical grounds. I have of course cisoussed the Matter with the Shei.Ji (discreetly), and have told him that the root of this attempt at raising trouble is undoubtedly i'rom outsiae. iiioiae ii. all- I also told Sadiq Hassan the sane thing, and asked f or. his oo-opere &gt;,ion. To ay knowledge I know that there is considerable resentment lelt oy uaaiq Hassan, Ashraf, the Postmaster, and. their friends on account o. ohe ieoe.:t disagreement between the Superintendent adn the . ostmas*er. I consider it my duty to inform you that I have in ^ my hi h opinion of the loyalty of the Superintendent-— in fact my opinion him has increased, having heard these i—a o i:iai 0 g.^ovaiices.'Regarding Lt # Chowdhri the situation is unchanged, or worse than what I reported in my last. He has done away with five more men,Punjabis, whom Captain Parke shipped off by last mail, after asking me to sijn their passports at the eleventh hour, so that they had no chance of any hearing by any other responsible ■person. They were about the most sensible of the lot, and one at least was a fairly literate man, Syed Hohd Islam. Sheikh Hamad whom I saw in Gazebiyah on T/ednesday afternoon, told me that he had had three petitions from the Gepoys which he had handed over to Captain Parke, The last was on Sunday with a long list of ^riev -ances, short rations, the bulk being misappropriated by Chowdhri, abuses and threats of dismissal and imprisonment, various amounts taken from the rank and file and also from prisoners, V/hen this last petition was given by Sheikh Hamad to Captain Parke with the advice to redress their wrongs and with an offer to pay the men from H,E, t s own privy purse so that they should be satisfied and the ! Subedar'(Lt, Chowdhri) may not have to suffer by repaying, it only brought about the immediate dismissal and despatch of five ox t-ie poor Petitioners, I handed over Pazl-Kusain's two letters to Captain Parke and spoke to him all that I had heard from some of his Pore© and from outsiders, including Arabs, also reminded him of the Petition bearing some twenty names, which was given me and which I nad handel him personally. The outcome was sadly dis- -appointing. lie had only his old pet remark to repeat, namely that / the men were put up by outsiders 7v r ho were enemies of Chowdhri,but that their was nothing aginst him and that his men were all quiet anc. satisfied after the expulsion of a few who 'made 'Pitnah.fi ' that / lie had already made enquiries and need not do anything more; but tiiat tne Political Agent( again said, the Agency) might make any inquiry, io. he liked. 3o it rests with you to do what you deem fit. oheikh amad also said that he felt the force was being reduced by these dismissals and with the Persians( and some Bahranis) talk aoout u-ovt, giving over Bahrain to Persia, the remaining men, with many malcontents, could not be regarded as sufficient for emergen- -cies, .1, 'Jar s All is resposible for the news that some Arabs have oeen asking him if the Port is being slowly evacuated^ while large -i ersian forces are said to 'he collected at Bushire for coming over to Bahrain as the Persians say in the bazaar.f RejPrdin^ Lt. Giiowdhri the situation is unchcin^ed,or worse thaJk what I reported in my last. He has done awi.y with I'ive more rnen,punjc bis, whom Cui taiyi J'uriiTr shipped off by last mail# after asr.i^ m* to si^n their passports at the eleventh hour, so that they had no chance of any hearing by any other responsible person.

The double murder, which was committed by a sepoy in the Bahrain Levy Corps, led to the immediate disbandment of the force, and the formation of a new armed police force for Bahrain in its place. The main correspondents in the file are the Political Agent in Bahrain (Major Clive Daly until September 1926, Lieutenant-Colonel Cyril Barrett thereafter), the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Prideaux), the Assistant to the Political Resident (Captain Horner), and the Advisor to the Bahrain Government (Charles Dalrymple-Belgrave).On 4 August 1926, a Levy sepoy ran amok at the Corps' fort, killing two and injuring Major Daly. Daly's first-hand account of the incident, written on 8 August 1926, is included in the file (handwritten copy folios 3-7, typewritten copy folio 60-65).

                           Cyclamenwere despatched to Bahrain. The murderer, Ismail bin Shah Murad, and an alleged accomplice, a Mullah closely associated with the Corps, were put under arrest. The incident closely followed the attempted murder of the chief of police on 2 August 1926. Following the double murder, a spate of violence and break-ins were reported in Bahrain (folio 18). Ismail bin Shah Murad's trial took place on 13 August, during which he pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to death (court report, folios 71-94). On 29 August Daly reported by telegram to Prideaux that anonymous letters had been received at the Agency, threatening the lives of himself, Belgrave, and the Director of the customs house (Mr de Grenier), if the accused man was executed as intended (folio 41). The original anonymous letters are included in the file (folios 98, 99). In the same telegram Daly reported a further shooting of a policeman in Manama.The murderer was executed by firing squad on 21 September 1926 (reported by Barrett, folio 133). The Mullah, Sayed Suleman bin Sayed, initially suspected by Daly as being a 'Bolo' agent (a Bolshevik or Russian spy, folios 15-16), was investigated and his personal papers examined (papers listed on folios 180-81). He was ordered to leave Bahrain for a minimum of two years (folios 114-15). In the wake of these incidents, the Levy Corps was immediately disbanded and plans made to despatch its Muscati and Makrani members back to their countries of origin (folio 11). Plans were also made for the recruitment of an armed police force, recruited from British subjects in the police forces of the Punjab (folios 53-54). Belgrave was placed in charge of the new police force, and travelled to Lahore in November 1926 to supervise its recruitment (folios 161-64).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Levy Corps</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Political reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Law reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000368#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
