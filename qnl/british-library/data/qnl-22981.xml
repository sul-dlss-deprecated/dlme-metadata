We cannot sa/ exactly how much we may hare t® spend yearly for the maintenance of prisoners. If we address to the P.R. on this matter, I am afraid Xhs. it will entail endless correspondence and will take a long time to obtain sanction from the Government of India. The practice hitherto has been to credit Joint Court Fees to this 'Hospital and Charity Funds' Account. Half of these were being sent to the Bahrein State at the end of the month. The other half remained at the credit of this fund and whenever there were insufficient funds in another accounts viz!'liaintenan« of Prisoners' /'Hospital Repairs Funds' ,&lt;?&gt; 'Slavery Relief Fubds' Major Daly transferred a portion of ±h±x it or as much as he liked to these heads. These sire local funds and there is no correspondence with lushire about these. These funds, therefor are under the sole control of the P.A. and he can deal with them as he likei. But only a few days before Ma^or Daly left he said that V in future^ Bahrein State Revenue stamps to the half value of i the Joint Court fees should be cancelled auaii the day the feesALezsy 'AL&gt;. e ^ l are collected and the other half should be credited to the iasliaR Government of India hjr cancelling Court Pee Stamps. i x th±Mic x&amp;hKxx There heing no regular or sanctioned allotment for ic these funds, I think we cannot ask the P.R., allot a certain amount to the 'haintenance of Prisoners account' and decrease corresponding!/ other heads. The only think, therefore, I could suggest is to follow^ the old procedure of remitting half the Joint Court Pees o the r to Bahrein State at the end of the month and the xjsxiua^ i half fcuediting the ''Hospital and Charity Punds’'account and transferring from time to time amounts required for the other heads to keep them going.
