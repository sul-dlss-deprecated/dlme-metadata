Dear Mr. Bellgrave: I would he most grateful to you if you could ^ let me have the figures relating to the registration of motor vehicles in Bahrain, including lorries tractors, motorcycles and the like. The statistics I have been able to secure relating to the imports and exports of Bahrain are not at all satisfactory, and I would greatly appreciate having the figures for the last three or four years giving the countries of destination and origin, if such have been compiled. With kindest personal regards, I aia, Sincerely yours, ‘ames s. Moose, Jr.QQNClDFtmM- £.0.No:0/427. Poiiticai Agency, Bahrain, the 22nd April 1934. Dear Colonel Fowle, I enclose a copy of a letter datec the 12th April 1934 which Belgrave received just before he left and tola ue Grenier to show to me. 2. I am not at all sure tnat tne best plan is not to leave the letter unanswered and to see wnat happens, rfeigrave left on leave early on the 20th April, so tnat tne letter may easily have missed himJ 3. On the other hand, it affords an opportunity of rubbing in our special position by replying that it has been handec to me as I deal with foreign affairs. But I should prefer not to give the information for which he asks, if I can avoid it, and to reply might give rise to a correspondence, in the course of which it would be likely to become very difficult to refuse information without appearing unfriendly. 4. On the whole, I think that the letter might, as I suggested above, be unanswered, but it is a straw which shows the way the wi&amp;d is blowing. Yours sincerely, ’he honourable , ^ Lieut-Oolonel T.C.Fowle.u.B.ii., Political Hesinent in the Persian Gulf Bushire.im G D • 0• No • Dated, the May 1 sB4 . f With relerence to your B.C.No .C/4&lt;;7,aated the 22nd April 1934 Colonel Fowle thinks that probably the best way would be to-refer Moose to the Bahrain trade reports which are published documents and therefore which anyone can get. If you have a spare copy of your last report you might possibly send one for Mooses infoma tion. € To Lieut-Colonel G. Loch, Political Agent, Bahrain,Confidential* Political Agency, Bahrain, the 16th Jane 1934. D.0.No:C/604-9/9. AS Bahrein Trade F.e o orte for Foreign Consuls . Will you kindly refer to Galloway f e demi-official letter No:1227 dated the 26th May 1934 about Mr. Moose’s request for information about traae and to our conversation on the subiect on the 15th June 1934. 2. It seems doubtful,the form in which it is printed, whether the Bahrain Trade heport is intended for sale to the Public and whether, therefore, it should be ^iven to the representatives of foreign Governments, and it was agreed that a ruling on the matter should be obtained from the Government of India.
