Sir 0 * ^ i, &gt; In your telegram Ho*' of the 22nd January regarding the proposed general negotiations between His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom and the Saudi Governnent, you reported a reference by the Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs to a promise to recognise Arab independence which, he alleged, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom had given to the late King Hussein, I understand that Fuad Bey Hamza attempted to argue that the attitude at present adopted by His Majesty's Government with regard to the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia was inconsistent with that promise. 2. I assume that the undertaking to which Fuad Bey Hamza was referring is that contained in the correspondence which took place in the years 1915 and 1916 between Sir Henry McMahon ana ring Hussein, and more particularly to King Hussein's letter of the 14th July, 1915, to Sir Henry McMahon, and Sir Henry McMahon's reply of the 24th October*1915. A summary of the first and a copy of the text of the second of ti.ese letters • are enclosed in this despatch for convenience of reference. 3 • In paragraph 8 of your telegram under reply you stated thcat you did not consider tln.t Fuad Hamza's remarks on this point need be taken too seriously at present; since then, € however? j have received your despatch Ho.17 of the 22nd LrJ't. January and your telegram Ho .23 of the 9th Jaxx February, from ]«* which it appears that the Saudi Government may attempt to pursue further the question of the independence of the Arab Rulers of / bdrew Ryan,K.B#E. ,C#M.G., etc•, etc •, etc », Jedda.- 2 ~ Vf, of the Persian Gulf. By the time this despatch reached you, you will have received telegraphic instructions as to the manner in which any such attempt should be dealt with. It may nevertheless be of use to you to have the following detailed account cf the legalposition of His Kajesty’s Govern- menu in regard to the point raised by Fuad Bey on the 20th March in connection with the McMahon-Hussein corresponannce . In the first place, whatever may be the exact meaning o± the unaei’taklng given to hing Hussein, it was certainly not a promise that His Majesty's Government would support the claim of King Hussein and his successors to include within their territories the entire area covered by that undertaking. The interpretation might perhaps be put forward that the /crabs within that area should be allowex independence to govern themselves ana perhaps to settle freely amongst themselves their future allegiance, but there is certainly nothing in the under taking which affords any support for the argument that a given piece of territory should belong to King Ibn Saud rather than to any other Arab ruler, such as for instance, the Sultan of Muscat• 5. Secondly, Sir Henry McMahon*s letter of the 24th Octooer 1915, to King Hussein expressly introduces the words 'without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab chiefs'. In the view of His Majesty's Government this phrase can only be construed as meaning that His Majesty's Government, being bound under their treaty relations with certain Arab Shaikhs, including the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast ana the Hadramout, to protect their territories, expressly placed it on record that nothing in the promise given to King Hussein was to interfere with their duty to those Shaikhs or with their obligat:: on to see that the Shaikhs retained possession over their territories. This is in fact the line which His Majesty’s Government are taking in the proposals which it is intended to make to King Ibn Saud with regard to the eastern and /ana south-eastern frontiers of his Kingdom, for an essential feature oi these je proposals is the contention that any rights of sovereignty which may exist over the territory on the seaward siae of the suggested 'desert tone' belong to the Shaikhdoms in question. Thirdly, it could not be held that, in claiming territory cn seaward side of the proposed 'desert zone” on behalf of these Shaikhs ci* cl tne Araos who live in that territory as subjects oi tne Shaikhs, His Majesty’s Government were violating tneir undertaking to King Hussein, since they purport to be making this claim in virtue of their existing treaties with the Shaikhs, which the promise made to King Hussein expressly safeguards* I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient servant, (for the Secretary of State), sd.

The last two lines of the foregoing definition clearly include Palestine*Copy Letter from Sir Henry McMahon to King Hussein of 24th October, 1915. 1 1 have received your letter (of 9th September) with much pleasure; ana your expressions of sincerity ana friendliness have given me the greatest satisfaction. 'j. msh regret that you should havr received from my last letter the impression that I regarded the question of the boundaries with coldness and hesitation; such was not the case, but it appeared to me the moment had not arrived when they could be profitablv discussed. f, I have realised, however, from your last letter, that you regard this question*as one of vital and urgent importance. I have therefore lost no time in informing the Government of Great Britain of the contents of your letter; and it is with great pleasure that I communicate to you on their behalf the following statement which, I am confident, you will receive with satis faction : - ''The districts of Mensina and Alexandretta and the portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be exluded from the proposed limits and boundaries. With the above modification, and without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab chiefs we accept these limits and boundaries, and in regard to these portions of tho territories therein in which Great Britain is fEee to act without detriment to the interests of her ally, France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your letter ,, Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs v/ithin the territories included in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca. Great Britain will guarantee the Holy Places against all external aggression and will recognise their inviolability. 'When the situation admits, Great Britain will give to the Araba her advice and will assist them to establish what may appear to be the most suitable forms of government in those various territories. 'On /'On the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance of Great Britain only, end that such European Advisers ana officials as r.ay be required for tne formation of a sound form of administration will be British. 'With regard to the vilayets of Bagdad and Basra, the Arabs will recognise that the established position and interests of Great Britain necessitate special measures of administrative control in order to secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local population and to safeguard our mutual economic interests. I am convinced th t this declaration will assure you beyond all possible doubts of the sympathy of Great Britian towards the aspirations of her traditional friends, the Arabs, and will result m a 1 irm and lasting alliance, the immediate results of which will be the expulsion of the Turks from the Arab countries and the f reeing ox the Arab peoples from the Turkish yoke which, for so many years, has pressed heavily upon them... 1 ’.CONFIDENTIAL.

Fuad produced statement in memorandum form on April 3rd. He explained that though it ;aut t . opposed to geographical boundary it was based on Saudi claim to areas frequented by Hurra Dimr n and Beni Hajir tribe© and certain sections of Manasir especially, and exclusion of all other tribes. Memorandum expressed definitions of proposed frontier as being between Saudi Arabia and ^at&amp;r, Trucial Sheikhdoms Sultamte of Muscat, Kadhr maut and other Shaikh- dams etc. in east south east and south Arabia. Following is summary omitting less important place names• Boundary with ^atar starts from coast of bohat ^alwa between Jebel Haksh and Jebel Dukhan leaving former to baud! Arabia and latter to %atar. Proceeds south and soutli-east i long line of eastern ^alail to Ariq Kupl^sii Ibn Shafi? and thence to Aqal as tar as coast where the Kaqiyan are left to ^atar and Khor al Odeia is claimed for Saudi Arabia. Line re-starts from point on coast twenty five kilometres from Khor al Odeid and follows line of tajann Sabakhat /Sabaknat atti and Kuiat Liwa to intersection of meridian 66 and parallel 22 leaving last named area to dhaikhaoms • Continues along meridian 56 to naralXel 19 thence in a straight line to intersection of meridian 52 and parallel l^ 1 'thence along parallel 17 to its intersection with violet line • Fuad anticipated _,jaut . claim to Khor al Odeid by saying it was necessary to control smuggling by Mu«ra. when we discussed subject further on ,.rabia he insistea that an honest effort had been made to include only tribes named above and said th t if experts discovered ilaws they could be rectified as the * adhram&amp;ut tribes might extend further north than Saudi Government had supposed* . g I offered line suggested in your telegram No#8 as modified by paragraph 2 of your telegram ho.43* Comments will follow when I have studied position further• I am sending text of statement by bag of April 8th. -Ryan*x% Note by Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. / f v ' Reference Minister, Jedtia’s telegram No.89 of 7th April 1935 to .olitical Resident. Proposed Saudi line would appear to be quite imxoossible, at any rate in the northern area since (u) it cuts into Qatar territory, Jdicluding Khor el Odeid, and (b) thence encroaches on Trucial Coast territory, especially Abu Dhabi*s and brings Saudi Arabia too near the coast. A possible modification might be from Baniyan to intersection of meridian 56 and parallel 22 and thence as proposed by Ibn Saud. This would not encroach on Oman territory between parallels 22 and 20 and I do not think it will encroach on Muscat territory further South to the North of Dhofar. We can await further developments. Doubtless His Majesty*s Government will ask for my opinion in due course* Id. T.C.F.

Although Ibn Saud^ territorial demands are very extensive he is showing many signs of present anxiety to settle outstanding questions generally. It may be advisable to take advantage of this and expedite further discussion of frontier question rather than adhere to policy laid down in your telegram No.33. For one thing it is desirable to make as much progress as possible before Fuad leaves next month. 2. I gave Fuad yesterday Memorandum confirming offer mentioned in penultimate paragraph of my telegram under reference. Only value of this is to show conservative character of His Majesty’s Government’s approach. It cannot be mat. I have mentioned oil consideration but I do not think Saudi Government know much about it or attach any-thing like as much importance to economic considerations as to extension of influence in desert. 3. I should tlon be disposed to proceed quickly Mut. inut. contemplated in paragraph 9 of your telegram No.8 and suggest desert zone should be recognised for ten years for which Saudi Government wish to prolong Treaty of Jedda. Inducement might be held out that while territories adjoining limits of zones would accrue _ respectively / i t *- 2 - respectively to Arab rulers not one would be committed as regards zone itself and there would be time for completion of study of tribal considerations before end of ten years. 4. I suggested zone should be defined as in correspondence ending with your telegram No .55* If desert zone solution is agreed further limitation proposed in Aden telegram No*19 seems to me unnecessary as Hadramaut tribes would have same access to zone as others. 5. It would be necessary to indicate at very early stage principles of regime proposed for zone. I suggest followings (a) All questions of sovereignty to remain in abeyance as between rulers concerned. (b) Rulers to have access to zone to control tribes normally frequenting areas under their sovereignty. (c) Parties concerned (?to take) in measures in the event of any serious disturbance in zone involving tribes of different allegiance. (d) No flying over except in exercise of right at (b) or to give effect to measures at (c). (e) No economic concessions. g, I have worded above proposals so as to recognise position of Arab rulers without defining their status or that I believe His Majesty’s Government whose position would be affirmed by terms of agreement being concluded by them. I am not sure whether point (d) above will be acceptable to His Majesty’s Government but it would probably improve chances of agreement. 7. If Saudi Government should refuse desert zone outright I should propose to offer without further delay area west of green and brown lines on map enclosed in Eastern /-3- Eastern Department's letter of February 21st as far as intersection with parallel 18 and north of line along that parallel as far as violet line* If this also were refused I should again slow down the negotiations* -Ryan(Received under Government of India, Foreign and Political Department endorsement No*F.14-N/35 of 3rd April 1935). Telegram xx. No.55, dated 22nd(reed.23rd)March 1935. From Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,London. To Minister, Jedda. (Repeated... .Aden and Government of India No.41). EXPRESS . Aden telegram No. 11 to Colonial Office shows that any new boundary cutting the Violet Line should not do so south of parallel 18. It also now appears most desirable - see Aden Despatch No .42 to Colonial Office copy to you by bag No .59 that Northern boundary of Aden Protectorate north of Hadramaut should run at least 20 miles north of southern edge of Great Sands (so as to leave strip of desert within Protectorate) and not along edge itself as suggested in paragraph 7 of Rendells letter of 7th November to Laithwaite and subsequent correspondence. It appears that this object could be achieved and a clear and reasonable boundary secured if Line in this xg area whether as marking Southern boundary desert zone or for purposes of paragraphs 9 and 10 of my telegram No.8 were (instead of following edge of sands) to run along parallel 18 between its intersection with Violet Line and its intersection with meridian 52. In that event it would probably be simpler and better (nothwithstanding now familiar objection to definition by geographical co-ordinates in imperfectly surveyed area) to re-define Eastern and South Eastern boundary oi proposed desert zone as follows: 'From intersection of parallel 22 noth and meridian 55 east, do*n that meridian to its intersection with parallel 20; thence in a straight line to intersection of meridian 52 with parallel 18; thence along that parallel to /HII III HI— - 2 - HHBBHnBriHHhi to its intersection of Violet Line”. Latter need not be referred to as such but could be separately defined. Northern terminal of frontier between Aden Protectorate and Sultanate of Muscat and Oman would then be at intersection of meridian 52 and parallel 18.

In the first place, although we shall not now be bartering our concessions la thi© area for desiderata elsewhere, we have, 1 think# beoos© reconciled to the idea that we shall in practice certainly have to make the *last resort f concession under ^tage Four/5*/ 66. 3 / Four (i.©. the hrom line/. m© assert sone would thus in fact lie cml.^ to the east of hsridfeaa in the second, place, the information contained In Aden despatch I Ho* 41;: of ^12th FjhrxiairT to me Colonial ffice has led !; us further to reduce the nrem of the desert sons (and heaee of the brown line ares in so far as its ami them limit 1® concerned} by shifting its southern boundary v&lt; considerably to the north of the edge of the sands (see Foreign Office telegraa to Aedcla Wo. 56 of the 22nd arch/.

BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA. 7th April 1935. Sir, | ^ith reference to my telegram Ho. 84 of April 6th, I have the honour to forward a translation of the statement which Fuad Bey Hamza handed to me on April 3rd regarding the eastern and south eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. As the text is not very claar in certain places I enclose also a copy of the original. 2 0 I am unable to identify several of the places named in the statement under hedd 1. Most of them would appear to be particular portions of the system known under the general name of Qala'il. This is shown in the maps and is described in Philby 'The Empty quarter' p.50 as 'the long escparpment of q a la*il, which forms the westward face of the ^atar plateau'. I doubt whether the portions of it named in the Saudi statement will be found in any map. I gather that the Saudi Government have relied on tribesmen for some of their information. 3. Otherwise the statement is pretty clear so far as it goes, except for the repeated use of a word which, according to my interpreter, menas 'parallel*. ¥hen it is applied to coordinates, it obviously menas only that the line follows the parallels of latitude and the meridians, but in other places the sense may be more doubtful. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Bushire and Aden. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Si*» TT Your most obedient, humble servant. Right Honourable ANDREW RYAN.

The Government of the Saudi Arab Kingdom consider that the frontier line which divides them and the Amirate of ^tar passes through the following places:- The said line begins at a point on the coast of the sea known as Bohat Salwa and follows (literally, runs parallel to) a line extending from the junction of Jebel Oukhan and the neighbouring territory in a western direction, leaving the ares (literally distance) which is situated on its west and which is located between Jebel Dukhan and Jebel An-Nakhsh to the Saudi Arab Kingdom, and Jebel Dukhan and what is behind it on the waat to qatar. The line then turns to the south and the south-east parallel to the slppe of the eastern gala'll {? eastern slope of the qala*il), leaving the Qala’il known as Qalalat Ad-Darb, Mashash As-Samim, Al-Maghdar, At-Ta * z, Tm-Samra, Ariq—Mashash Ibn Shafi and the territory situated to the west thereof known as Ariq and qala* il to the Saudi Arab Kingdom, and those to the east of this line to qatar* The line then extends from Mashash Ibn Shafi to Al_*Aql a s far as the coast of the sea leaving Kaqiyan ^atar to qatar and the Khor Al-Odeid to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. 2. The Government of the Saudi Arab Kingdom consider also that the said frontier line which divides them a nd the Arab Amirates and Shaikhdoms situated on the Persian Gulf runs through the following places:- The said line begins at a place on the sea coast 25 kilometres distant from the Khor Al-Odeid and extends to the south and south east parallel to the lands knows au Majann, Sabakhat-Matti and Khufat al-Liwa leaving the lands belonging to Khufat al-Liwa to the Arab Amirates and those to the west to the Saudi Arab KingdomKingd om. 3&lt;&gt; The said line runs from the limits of the territory of Khufat al-liwa as far/as the intersection of Meridian 56 degrees East with Parallel 22 degrees North and it then follows (literally, runs parallel to) Meridian 56 degrees East as far ss the point where it meets Parallel 19 degrees North, It then goes direct until it comes to the intersection of Parallel 17 degrees North with Meridian 52 degrees East and *1 then goes direct in the western direction along (literally parallel to) Parallel 17 degrees North until it cuts the line known as the violet line*(E.2373/77/91). mo distributhon- Oypher telegram to Sir Andrew Ryan, (jedda).

Question was considered by Middle ^ast Official Sub-Committee on April 16th with following results. 2. When desert zone solution was originally proposed la&amp; November it was anticipated that far larger area would be subject to special desert regime than that now comtemplat- ed. Information since received shows that Southern Frontier of ary concession to Ibn Gaud whether in full sovereignty or in form of a desert zone should not be further south than line starting from intersection of parallel 18 and violet line and running roughly east - north east up to and throu^i intersection of parallel 19 and meridian 62 (and if necessary onwards in the same (south of BanAiyan) up to meridian 52 in full sovereignty will have to be made in the end. This would further reduce proposed desert zone to a trapezoid between meridian# 4. sub-Committee consider that in these circumstances complicated desert zone regime which might nave been 3* There is also little question that final 62 and 66. suitable /•uitable for large area originally in question is too elaborate a solution for this very reduced and inaccessible area. They think that it will be better not to attempt possible difficult task of working out its details and of imposing it on I bn Baud and to abandon the whole idea of desert to zones special servitudes in this area proceeding^direct offer of further limited concessions in full sovereignty by one or possibly two stages, 5* First and second stage contemplated in my telegram lio.B i*e, definition of Ibn baud's claims and offer of our opening concession have now been conciuaed and next stage will presumably open with Saudi reply to your offer of so- called 'green line 1 ' (see your telegram lTo.84 paragraph 6) • If as you anticipate this offer is rejected as entirely insufficient you are now authorised to offer Ibn Baud in full sovereignty and without any servitudes further area enclosed by line running from a point on Green Line to South and distance of at least 5 miles from BAN!YAN to intersection of meridian 52 and parallel 22 degrees 30 thance due south along meridian 52 to its intersection with parallel 19 and thence in a straight line intersecting parallel 18 with Violet Line, this can be referred to as 'Brown Line * concession. 6. If this also proves insufficient* you may as a last resort and if you think there is hope of its leading to atireement, make a further offer in tull sovereignty and without servitudes of area bounded by a line running from intersection of parallel 22 degrees 30 am meridian 52 due east to meridian 53 thence due south to intersection of meridian 53 with prolongation in a straight line of sothern boundary of Brown Line concession described in preceding: paragraph. His majesty's Government are not prepared to make /8. 3- make any concession to I bn Baud to east of meridian 53. There is no evidence of his having any rights or permanent influence to hast of this line greater or as great as that oi any other Rulers concerned and there are other serious objec tions to allowing Ibn Baud to acquire such rights or influence there* You should not however allow yourself to be drawn into argument on this point and if this third offer fails to satisfy King it will probably be necessary to suspend negotiations. Consequently while appreciating point in paragraph 1 of your telegram No.89 I consider that unless agreement is in sight this concession should oniy be offered very cautiously. In possible event of negotiations not leading to early result their subsequent resumption would be on basis of position reached at the end of present discussions and if concession to meridian 63 is offered now without result we shall have lost our last concession for the purposes of future bargaining. 7. AS you are aware and have yourself advised there are strongest objections to allowing Ibn Baud to acquire access to sea on Eastern side oi qatar Peninsula or to establish a position for King a© one of Trucial Coast Rulers. Moreover territory claimed in depression east of Green Line in this region has already' been recognised by His Majesty’s Government as belonging to Shaikhs oi qatar and Abu Dhabi, His Majesty'* Government having formally recognised rights of latter ( which they have maintained against Turks) in Gdeid and also in Aq&amp;l (compare India Of xice memorandum B.430 enclosed in Mr* Rendel f s letbex oi March i6th, 934). There can accordingly be no question of any concession to Ibn Suud in this region. xou should make this clear to Saudi Government explaining that you are un able to discuss any further concession east of green line north of Banaiyan.8* Sub-committee also agreed that in viev* of legal and practical difficulties likely to arise it will be best not to attenpt to define Saudi frontier in a purely negative sense as against a vacuum in the east ( e.g* by mere recognition by His Majesty♦s Government th&amp;t South-Jast frontiers of Saudi Arabia are so and so) nor to secure purely negative renunciation by Ibn Saud (even if it could be obtained) of all rights or claims beyond those frontiers on the lines of Article 16 of Treaty of Lausanne. They consider the best course will be to specify the frontier in a single comprehensive instrument as being concluded between Saudi Arabia on the one hand and ^atar, Abu Dhabi Muscat and the Aden Protectorate on the other (raut) without specifying boundary dividing the four latter territories from each other and to regard full sovereignty of other states concerned as extending right up to boundary line. Shaikh of via tar and of Abu DhaM and Aden i rotectorate will be represented in the negotiations by His Majesty*s Government, position as regards Muscat is more difficult and has not yet been fully explored but for your confidential information India Office would be prepared if necessary and subject to consent of Government of India to endeavour to obtain from Sultan authority for yourself or other British delegate to represent him. - ,_XiAST AY OF STi-.tB FOR - FGRLIOII AFFAIRSXX Telegram H*M « 1 8 Minister, Jedda* Secretary of State for Foreign Affaire, London* No.114* !

THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. Rendel. Sir Andrew- Ryan (His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda). Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Arabian Minister in London). Mr. RENDEL recalled the discussions which had taken place with Fuad Bey in London in September 1934 and had been continued in Jedda during the winter. The most important question dealt with during those discussions had been that of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. The position was that the Saudi Government had communicated a statement of their claims to Sir A. Ryan on the 3rd April, and that Sir A. Ryan, on the instructions of His Majesty’s Government, had offered the Saudi Government a strip of territory to the east of the Anglo-Turkish boundary (generally known as the “ blue line ”), which, as Fuad Bey was aware—although it had been agreed not to stress this aspect of the question for the present—His Majesty’s Government regarded as the present legal boundary. The concession which His Majesty’s Government had now offered was shown on the map of which Mr. Rendel gave Fuad Bey a copy, by a green line, and Fuad Bey would observe that it included the whole of the western shore of the Dobat-as-Salwa, the important strategic post of Qasr-as-Salwa, and the Akhwan settlements of Sakak and Mabak (Anbak) at the base of the Qatar Peninsula, whence it ran due south to the Abu Dhabi well of Banaiyan. The Saudi Government had not yet replied to this offer, and Fuad Bey had left Arabia before it could be discussed. It had therefore been agreed that the conversations should be continued in London, and Mr. Rendel suggested that Fuad Bey should begin by giving his views on Sir A. Ryan’s offer. FUAD BEY HAMZA replied that he had the impression that the frontier line offered by Sir Andrew Ryan was not based upon any relevant material facts. The proposals contained in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April were, on the other hand, based upon the most important factor in the desert, namely, the recognised grazing grounds (“ diras ”) of the various nomadic tribes. He was convinced that it would be impossible to draw the frontier on anything but a tribal basis of this kind, and he saw no alternative to the system proposed by the Saudi Crovernment. Mr. RENDEL observed that it would be difficult to base a line on purely tribal considerations. The greater part of the area concerned consisted of an immense expanse of featureless desert more comparable to a sea than to any ordinary land area. According to the information of His Majesty’s Government the various tribes wandered very widely over this area, and it would be impossible to base territorial claims on the extent of these wanderings. Moreover, the information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government was that many of these tribes were of uncertain and shifting allegiance. There were, of course, certain areas which were predominantly or exclusively frequented by certain tribes, owing a definite and exclusive allegiance to a particular ruler. His Majesty’s Government had taken such circumstances into full account in making their proposals. But an arrangement based on tribal considerations alone would certainly prove impracticable. SIR A. RYAN supported Mr. Ren del's view that a simple allocation of tribal areas could not replace a territorial frontier. Every attempt to leave [431 bb—3] b2 territorial frontiers itmd on the basis of allocation of tnbe^onk, ^hitherto e* sms s-sassa-“ m, »«.»/- personal, sovereignty. Mb.

Ryan had explained to s 0 efrome 0 definite l,mi;, beyond which territorial sovereignty could not be exercised even if such territorial sovereignty were not, m fact, exercised un to Aat limit This would not prevent the tribes wandering freely from one territory 3 to 'another, and no doub*! suitable arrangements could even^ made regarding their taxation, &amp;c., as had been done m tire case o ne tribes which migrated between Saudi Arabia, Transjordan, Syria, and Iraq. Arrange ments could be made defining the allegiance of various tr ^ ?, r . But whatever was done about this, it seemed clear that a definition of the u t mate, limits of territorial sovereignty must now be established ar-p ANDREW RYAN pointed out that although the line which Hiij Majesty’s Government had now offered the Sandi Government did not run very far to the east of the Anglo-Turkish line, it did definitely take into account existing facts, even though these facts might be at variance with what His Maiesty’s Government regarded as the technical legal position since it conceded to King Abdul Aziz sovereignty over Qasr-as-Salwa and the Akhwan settlements which King Abdul Aziz had established to the east of the Anglo-Turikish frontier. His Maiesty’s Government were prepared to concede this, and other areas permanently inhabited by Murra tribesmen of Saudi allegiance, but they could not possibly concede the whole expanse of desert over which this tribe was accustomed to range at various times of the year. FUAD BEY suggested that in drawing the northern end of the proposed frontier in the neighbourhood of the Qatar Peninsula, the political allegiance of actual settlements and recognised districts should be adopted as a guiding principle. He considered that King Abdul Aziz had an nnassailable claim to an area considerably to the east and north-east of the line proposed by His Majesty s Government in this sector. As regards the desert area to the south, the only method of drawing the frontier, in his view, would be to take account of wells and grazing areas known to be under the predominant control or ownership of certain tribes. He maintained that the majority of such wells and areas in South- Eastern Arabia were definitely recognised as being the property of one particular tribe, although they might also be used by others, and that it would be possible to ascertain their ownership and to make use of this knowledge in defining the tribal areas. Mr. RENDEL said that His Majesty’s Government had been influenced by the same considerations, and that it was for this reason that they maintained that the well of Banaiyan must belong to Abu Dhabi. They were satisfied on the information before them that the claim of the sheikh to this well, which was indeed a key-point in his territory, was a sound one; and from what had passed during the very full discussions of this questions which had taken place during the winter, he saw no hope of His Majesty’s Government modifying their attitude on this point, although they were willing to discuss further concessions to the south of it, where such concessions might be easier to arrange. FUAD BEY made it clear that the Saudi Government could not accept the views of His Majesty’s Government about Banaiyan, which, he claimed, belonged exclusively to the Murra tribe. He invoked the evidence of Mr. Bertram Thomas on this point, but Mr. RENDEL pointed out that Mr. Bertram Thomas’s evidence showed that the allegiance of the tribes in this area was most uncertain, and further quoted the fact that Mr. Philby had apparently been obliged to turn west wards in this neighbourhood in the following year, since he had found himself reaching the limits of the area over which King Abdul Aziz exercised effective sovereignty. On this last point Fuad Bey replied that Mr. Philby had in fact only been turned back towards the west by his failure to find any water. FUAD BEY repeated his contention that Banaiyan could not be regarded as belonging alh foil liflf At) iti He ac its G( we wi If ex Ki sti st; II th D w sc dl ti tc s&lt; e a 0 1 i 1 i s 1to Abu Dhabi; but this point was not pursued at this meeting, although it was alluded to from time to time, and it was not until the next meeting on the following day that Fuad Bey developed it further. FUAD BEY then reverted to the question of the northern terminal of the line now proposed by His Majesty’s Government, and tried to show that King Abdul Aziz could claim not only Qasr-as-Salwa, but the hills to the north-east of it up to a point some 10 or 15 miles up the eastern shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa. He claimed that the frontier should run thence in an easterly direction, and then turn slightly southwards and run to the sea to the north of Khor-al-Odeid. A long discussion followed on the question of this line. As regards the north-western end of it Mr. RENDEL pointed out that the Qatar Peninsula was a clearly defined geographical feature. It was almost an island, and it was only reasonable that the frontier between it and its neighbours on the mainland should follow the natural geographical division between the mainland and the peninsula itself. It was because of this natural geographical division that His Majesty’s Government had been prepared to concede to King Abdul Aziz the whole of the western shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa, but this same argument applied in turn with equal force against carrying the frontier up the eastern shore of the bay. If this were done the same anomaly would be created as that which at present existed on its western shore. His Majesty’s Government had in fact offered King Abdul Aziz a most generous concession in this area, including the important strategic point of Qasr-as -Salwa. Moreover, the Jebel Naksh and the hills in its neighbourhood were part of the same geographical formation as the Jebel Dukhan, whfch was indisputably the property of Qatar. The case, therefore, for following the natural geographical frontier at this point appeared overwhelming. The discussion on this portion of the line was resumed at intervals at various stages of the conversation, and eventually FUAD BEY asked whether Flis Majesty’s Government would be prepared to offer a line, which he indicated on the map, running eastwards and south-eastwards from the eastern shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa, and following for some distance the circumference of a circle with a radius of some 10 or 15 miles from Qasr-as-Salwa. Mr. RENDEL explained that he had no authority to offer any concession on this point. He had had the greatest difficulty in securing general agreement for so large a concession as that which had, in fact, been offered. As luad Bey no doubt knew, His Majesty 5 s Government were, in fact, committed to the piotec- tion of Qatar against any major aggression. If His Majesty’s Government were to make any further concession to the north-east of Qasr-as-Salwa, they would so weaken the position of Qatar strategically that they might not be able effectively to carry out this obligation. Just as Qasr-as-Salwa might be regarded as an important strategic outpost for Saudi Arabia, so the area to the north-east of it was an essential strategic area from the point of view of the safety of Qatar. Indeed it was much more important for Qatar to retain this aiea than foi Saudi Arabia’ to hold Qasr-as-Salwa, since Qatar was a very small State with no hinterland, whereas Saudi Arabia covered a vast area, and was theiefoie m a far stronger position from the point of view of defence. FUAD BEY at a later stage of the meeting stated, in reply to a question by Mr. Ward, that he thought that King Abdul Aziz might be prepared 1 to abandon his claim to the Jebel Naksh, which he described as an outlying spin of t e Jebel Dukhan range. , ^ ^ ^ -a &gt; Fuad Bey then raised the question of the Saudi claim to Khor-al-Odeid, | which he described as being the most vital point at issue, and to which he main tained that King Abdul Aziz possessed an established and irrefutable right. He explained that the Khor-al-Odeid had in the past been well known as a landing place for merchandise for the Hasa coast, and that King Abdul Aziz could no 1 abandon an outlet to the sea which possessed such important possibilities ot i commercial development. SIR A. RYAN pointed out that Fuad Bey had told him at Jedda when describing the Saudi claims, that King Abdul Aziz wanted to secure Khoi-a- Odeid in order to stop smuggling through it into Saudi territory and that this seemed rather inconsistent with the contention that it was needed foi commeieia . development. [431 bij—3] B 2&amp; 5 % ifoii iiiij ofl heli ik- tori'j of | rOl-fr. esai iV -dk jostl; did not in fact possess any internationally recognised rights to the east of it. The United States oil companies had been informed of this, and had not questioned the position. If the present proposals of His Majesty’s Government were accepted, King Abdul Aziz would obtain a valid, undisputed and permanent frontier, which would be a great advantage not only to him, but also—what was perhaps of even more importance—to his successors. Would it not then be wise to accept the present offer of a sound and permanent frontier, rather than perpetuate a situation which must inevitably be unstable and might lead to serious difficulty eventually? The frontier which His Majesty’s Government had proposed was geographically sound and corresponded to the facts of the situation as they had been ascertained as the result of long and careful enquiry. He begged Fuad Bey to consider the question afresh on this basis. FUAD BEY gave no indication that King Abdul Aziz would be prepared to modify his attitude. If Mr. Rendel’s instructions were rigid, so were his own. It was eventually agreed, however, that Fuad Bey and the Saudi Minister should study the maps and material communicated to them and seek instructions from their Government. On the receipt of these instructions, the question would be considered how far the discussions could be further usefully pursued.

Section 1. [E 3946/77/91] Record of the First Part of the Second Conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza held on June 25, 1935, at 11-50 a.m. THE following were present: Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan. Fuad Bey Hamza. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. Mr. RENDEL opened the conversation by informing Fuad Bey that in order to make it clear that His Majesty’s Government were not adopting a purely negative attitude, he wished at once to state that they were ready to offer King Abdul Aziz a further concession of territory to the south and east of Banaiyan in addition to the ‘ ‘ green line ’ ’ offer which had been made by Sir Andrew Ryan in April last and had formed the subject of discussion at the meeting on the 24th June. This further concession was the area bounded on the north, east, and south by what was shown on the map, which he then handed to Fuad Bey, as a brown line, and might therefore be known in future as the “ brown line concession ”—a line, that is, running from a point on the £ £ green line ’ ’ to the south of, and distant at least 5 miles from, Banaiyan, to the intersection of meridian 52° E. and parallel 20° 30' N.; thence due south along meridian 52° E. to its intersection with parallel 19° N. and thence in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 18° N. with the “ violet line ” of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. Fuad Bey was given a map on which the two concessions were marked. FUAD BEY HAMZA, in reply, said that as a result of the first day’s conversa tions he had re-examined the information in his possession regarding the proper attribution of Banaiyan, which His Majesty’s Government had claimed on behalf of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. He was now satisfied in his own mind not merely that the well of Banaiyan belonged to the Murra tribe, but that sheikhs of this tribe, who were definitely in the service of King Abdul Aziz, controlled a string of wells (which Fuad Bey named) running eastward from Banaiyan as far as Safq (Sufuk). Mr. RENDEL suggested that it would be of assistance to His Majesty’s Government in considering these claims if Fuad Bey could provide a memorandum stating the Saudi view of the position in detail and giving the fullest possible evidence in support of it. FUAD BEY agreed to do so. It was then agreed to proceed to the discussion of various secondary questions, the first of which was the possible acquisition by His Majesty s Government of certain minor air facilities on the Hasa coast of Saudi Arabia. This part of the conversation is recorded separately. Eastern Department, Foreign Office, June 25, 1935.Confidential* r* C A m EX PRE SS LETTER (AIR MAIL).

CONFIDENTIAL. July 3, 1935. Section 1. [E 4126/77/91] Record of First Part of Third Meeting ivith Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on July 2, 1935. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan (His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda). Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi- Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi-Arabian Minister in London). Mr. RENDEL recalled that, at the two previous meetings at the Foreign Office, discussions about the south-eastern frontiers had been confined to the northern portion of the proposed boundary. It would not be possible to proceed with negotiations on this part of the line until each side had had time to consider the arguments put forward by the other. He would like to make it clear, however, that His Majesty’s Government could not modify their attitude in regard to the claims of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz in regard to the part of the line at the base of the Qatar Peninsula or in the region of the Khor-al-Odeid. They would, however, give careful consideration to the memorandum which Fuad Bey had promised on the question of the proper attribution of Banaiyan and its district. FUAD BEY HAMZA replied that he preferred to postpone further detailed discussion of the northern portion of the boundary until His Majesty’s Govern ment had studied his memorandum, which he hoped to have ready very shortly. Speaking about the south-eastern frontier problem as a whole, he could hold out little hope that King Abdul Aziz would be able to accept the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, since the boundary they had suggested, unlike that proposed in the memorandum communicated by Fuad Bey to Sir A. Ryan on the 3rd April, 1935, was not based upon the existing situation in the desert. King Abdul Aziz would no doubt be ready to give way on specific points if the facts could be shown to be otherwise than he claimed, but he could not break his pledges to those tribes who had placed themselves under his protection. Fuad Bey hoped that His Majesty’s Government would appreciate the difficulties which confronted the King—^particularly in view of his position vis-a-vis Arab national sentiment—when asked to surrender territory to which he had an established claim. Mr. RENDEL explained that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the position of King Abdul Aziz. But he could not accept Fuad Bey’s contention that the proposals of His Majesty’s Government were not based on the existing situation. The line they were offering was based upon facts ascertained after the most careful enquiry. He then suggested that the meeting should proceed to discuss the southern sector of the line. Since the discussions with Fuad Bey Hamza in London in September 1934, much detailed information had been obtained in regard to the allegiance and distribution of tribes in this area, and the southern sector of the line which His Majesty’s Government were now offering (running from the inter section of the Anglo-Turkish “violet” line of 1914, and parallel 18 N. to the intersection of meridian 52° E. and parallel 19° N.) had been drawn up in conformity with this information so as to include within the Aden Protectorate the territory predominantly inhabited by the Hadhrami tribes of the Protectorate. It was true that the proposed frontier was a straight and artificial line; but this was inevitable in the case of a line running through a featureless and practically uninhabited desert, and need present no difficulties, since both parties were trying to fix the ultimate limits of territorial sovereignty and not to establish a frontier in the European sense of the word. 8025 [11839—1]9 1 FUAD BEY remarked that the drawing of the boundary in this sector would depend upon what tribes His Majesty’s Government claimed for the Hadhramaut, He was understood to say that there were three important tribes m the area between the central desert and the Hadhramaut Valley-Hie Seiar, Karab and Jinabar—and that great authority was wielded in this region by a certain sherif, who was in correspondence with all the neighbouring Governments-with the King of the Yemen with the Saudi Government, and, Fuad Bey supposed, with the authorities in the Aden Protectorate. Fuad Bey explained that King Abdul Aziz did not claim the allegiance of the Seiar and the Karab, although the Imam of the Yemen might do so, but, even so, he considered that the line proposed by His Majesty’s Government was placed much further north than could possibly be justified by the facts. Returning to the general question of the frontier as a whole, he enquired whether His Majesty’s Government would agree to a map bein°* prepared to illustrate the habitats of the tribes in the desert, and to seryly as a &amp; basis for the allocation of territory? Fuad Bey adverted to the argument he had produced at the first meeting on the 24th June, namely, that the dira£ op thp tribes were fixed and could be definitely ascertained by experts. Mr. RENDEL pointed out that there was a wide difference between the * extreme limits within which a tribe might wander (and which would inevitably overlap with the limits of other tribes) and the actual teriitory within which tribe was predominant. His Majesty’s Government had always been ready to recognise as belonging to a tribe territory in which it was unquestionably the predominant influence, but it seemed obvious that there would have to be | compromise as between the extreme limits of the various tiibal diras. SIR ANDREW RYAN brought the discussion back to the southern sector of the frontier. He pointed out that in the south-east and south the line proposed by King Abdul Aziz himself (in the memorandum communicated by Fuad Bey on the 3rd April, 1935) was itself artificial, inasmuch as it was a straight line defined by geographical co-ordinates. On the other hand, luad Bey had told him that the King only claimed three tribes (the Murra Beni Haiir and Dimran rDimnanl) and part of another (the Manaslr) in the Ruba-al-Khali It luad Bey wished the allocation of territory to take place on the basis ot diras, he suggested that it would be useful if he could produce a map showing the diras o these three and a half tribes to serve as a working basis for the discussions it was remarkable that a claim to less than four tribes could be held to .lustily claims (as made in Fuad Bey’s memorandum of the 3rd April) covering an enormous portion of South-Eastern Arabia. FUAD BEY enquired the reasons which led His Majesty’s Government to propose a southern boundary sloping north-east from the intersection of the “ violet ” line and parallel 18. Why was the line not carried due eastwards along parallel 18 ? Mr. RENDEL explained that the line followed the direction of the coast and of the natural features of the country, which all ran towards the north-east in this part of Arabia. It was obviously necessary that there should be a continuous belt of territory between the boundary with Saudi Arabia and tne coast of the Hadhramaut, since it was known that the territory m the possession of Hadhrami tribes ran back a considerable distance beyond the steppe countiy on the edge of the desert and into the sands themselves. His Majesty s Govern ment were satisfied that the southern boundary they had proposed was tair ana in accordance with facts, but if King Abdul Aziz could show that their data we e wrong they would be ready to consider any evidence he could bring forward support of his contention. FUAD BEY observed that he could not accept the statements of Bn task experts as to the position in this area as necessarily correct. There were otM experts from among the tribes whose evidence could be, and had been, heard, if_ as he thought was the only proper course—it was decided to worK on u basis of tribal diras, it would be possible to send out an Internationa commission or some such impartial body to decide questions of fact on t e spo Mr. RENDEL and SIR ANDREW RYAN pointed out that both sides were aiming at a rational geographical boundary and were agreed as to the necess for an elucidation of the relevant facts.

The case hardly seemed one in which an international commission could accomplish useful work in the Ruba-al-Khali, where the population was sparse, wild and nomadic, and where it would hardly be practicable to interrogate tribal leaders; moreover, before the tribal situation was accepted as a basis it would be necessary to decide the exact attribution of all the tribes in question. There were' too, other considera tions besides that of tribal diras. Fuad Bey had virtually admitted this by defending the Saudi claim to the Khor-al-Odeid at the first meeting on the ground of its commercial importance to Saudi Arabia. Mr. Rendel and Sir Andrew Ryan went on to express the view that the next stage in the negotia tions should be the production by Fuad Bey (for consideration by His Majesty’s Government) of the fullest possible information in support of his arguments against the southern sector of the line proposed by His Majesty’s Government, and of his contention that the line proposed in his memorandum of the 3rd April (a line running on the south from the intersection of meridian 56° £. and parallel 22 ° N. to the intersection of meridian 52° E. and parallel 17° N., thence due west along parallel 17 until its intersection with the Anglo-Turkish ‘ £ violet ” line) offered the fairest and most suitable boundary. It would be most convenient if this information were to be supported by a map showing the limits of the diras of the specific tribes claimed by the Saudi Government. FUAD BEY replied that he could supply this information, if necessary, though it would take a long time, as it could only be obtained in Arabia. For his part he preferred the alternative course, namely, that His Majesty’s Government should produce a detailed statement of their criticisms of the line which King Abdul Aziz had proposed. This line had been evolved in accordance with the request made by His Majesty’s Government in the preceding autumn for a statement of the King’s claims. Much trouble had been taken to collect evidence and to explore the tribal position, and he was convinced that the line was both accurate and fair. King Abdul Aziz had not hesitated to make sacrifices on his side where the facts did not warrant his maintaining his claims, and Fuad Bey cited as an instance the abandonment of the Saudi claim to the Manahil, Ahl Kathir and Muhara [Mahra] sub-tribes (branches of the Da’akeih tribe) although when he had written is book about Arabia a couple of years ago he had claimed them for Saudi Arabia. But no sooner had King Abdul Aziz complied with the request of His Majesty’s Government and put forward a statement of his claims, than His Majesty’s Government, without even replying to this or stating their objections to it, had put forward an alternative, and quite inadequate, counter-proposal of their own. This suggested that they had never intended to take King Abdul Aziz’s proposals seriously, and were merely trying to strike a bargain, instead of getting at the facts. It seemed to him only just and reasonable that His Majesty’s Government should now give their views on the line proposed by King Abdul Aziz, instead of pressing their own counter suggestion and inviting him to offer his criticisms on it. Mr. RENDEL regretted that he could not share Fuad Bey’s opinion as to the next stage. It had been agreed that while negotiations were in progress no emphasis would be laid on the fact that His Majesty’s Government regarded the Anglo-Turkish Blue and Violet lines as defining the strict legal position in regard to the frontier; but he felt bound to point out that the Anglo-Turkish lines did, in fact, form the starting-point for the negotiations. His Majesty’s Government had, however, made the most thorough enquiry as to the existing facts, and, as a result, they were now offering important concessions in derogation of the strict legal position; if the Saudi Government were not satisfied it seemed clear, therefore, that it was for them to give their reasons. It was not a question of criticising the proposals as a whole. The line could be divided into various sectors. The sector from the Dohat-as-Salwa to Banaiyan had formed the subject of very full discussion at the first meeting, and Mr. Rendel had explained in detail the reasons for which His Majesty’s Government could not accept the claims of King Abdul Aziz in this sector. As regards the corner of the line at Banaiyan, he had already undertaken that Fuad Bey’s promised memorandum should be carefully studied. They were now discussing the southern part of the frontier, and as Fuad Bey was demurring to the proposals of His Majesty’s Government in this sector of the line as well, it was surely for him to give his reasons and /elaborate his views.. Apart claims put forward in the Sand! memorandum ot last Ap ma „ife St lj the south and south-east and included so vast an a e a ^ outside the dominions of King Abdul Aziz, that “tle^w ^ G ^ enlIne i criticising it m detail. ® c . cessions on so immense a scale involving the W °s rai n of“te Titorv belonging to rulers to whom they were bound by ancient cession °i territory oe S S . j th th an( i the south-east were merely treaties.

Jane g.?..,l£2£» YOU will remember that on the morning of the 25th June, during our conversation on the subject of the south-eastern frontiers, you promised to let me have a memorandum setting out in detail the precise reasons for which your Government regarded the wells from Banaiyan to Sufuk in the hinterland of Abu Dhabi as belonging to a section of the Murra tribe, which owed exclusive allegiance to King Abdul Aziz. As I explained in the course of our conversation, His Majesty’s Government, on the information at present in their possession, regard the well of Banaiyan as belonging to the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi. I will, however, gladly submit to my Secretary of State any arguments on this point which you may care to bring forward, though you will understand that I cannot give you any indication whether these arguments will lead His Majesty’s Government to modify the attitude which they have adopted, as I explained it to you in the course of our discussions. I will await the receipt of your memorandum before pursuing this question further. Yours very sincerely, G.W.

Section 3. ”[ E 4111/77/91] Fuad Bey Hamza to Mr. Rendel.—(Received July 3 .) Saudi Arabian Legation, London, Dear Mr. Rendel, July 2, 1935. I AM very sorry that I was unable to prepare the note I promised you in the course of our conversation on the 25th June on the subject of the line of frontiers in Eastern and Southern Arabia before receiving your letter dated the 27th June. This delay was caused by unavoidable reasons of which you are no doubt aware. 2 . I would like to explain most emphatically and sincerely that the line of frontiers given in the note which I had the pleasure to present to Sir Andrew Ryan in Jedda on the 3rd April, 1935 (29th Thil Hijja, 1353), was defined after the most careful investigation into the actual situation at the present moment and after the following important factors have been taken into consideration : — (1) The fact that both Governments (the British and the Saudi Arabian) have agreed to put aside the legal question so long as it was possible to reach an honourable agreement, as it was preferable to try to draw a new line for the frontiers which would be acceptable to all parties concerned and which would safeguard the permanent common interests. (2) The fact that the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz did not adopt the wide principle which was the basis of her relations with the tribes of the desert which had declared their allegiance and submission to His Majesty the King as the tribes of Da-akeih, viz., A1 Manahil, Ahl Kathir and Ahl Mahra—and most of the tribes of A1 Manasir, A1 Darn’, A1 ’Awamir, Beni Ghafir and others, but were content to mention the natural boundaries which were at the same time generally recognised by the tribes inhabitating the desert as belonging to the tribes on whose members and lands His Majesty's Government has exercised direct influence for a long period, during which their ordinary members and their sheikhs were actually in His Majesty’s service and His Majesty’s regular army. (3) His Majesty’s Government’s realisation of the extreme difficulties which may arise as a result of an unjust delineation of the frontiers and particularly the great resentment which the tribes may feel if they were abandoned after having rendered loyal allegiance and submission all these long years and after having built their hopes for the future on the continuity of the system of government devised for them and His Majesty’s Government’s wish to keep its promise and fulfil its obligations and responsibility towards its subjects and its neighbours. 3. Having outlined to you these fundamental points, I would like to point out that the line of the frontiers which I presented to Sir Andrew Ryan does not contain any exaggeration nor does it leave any room for bargaining or discussion. As I have pointed out above, due note was taken in delineating this line, of the tribal considerations which are generally admitted by the Bedouin population and more especially by those of them who are neutral and are therefore not interested in proving somebody’s claim or refuting it. 4. You will no doubt remember what I told you in our last two meetings, that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciating the position delegated to me the task of checking the official data concerning the frontiers by taking the evidence of certain neutral persons among the experts of the desert. As a result I became convinced that the line referred to above does not exceed the true state of affairs and that the wells of Banaiyan, Sufuq, Battha and Bataihin belong to the Ahl Murra. 5 . I would like to explain to you now certain details concerning the places and wells belonging to the tribes which would make it easier to understand.2 (1) A1 Aqal wells, i.e., Aqal-an-Nakhla, Aqal-ar-Rimth, &amp;c., are commonly used by Murra and Qatar tribes. (2) Duwaihin belongs to the Manasir tribe. , , , , ( 3 ) Mij an and Sabakha Matti are shared m common by botn the Murra and the Manasir tribes. 1 . (4) Banaiyan, Sufuq, Khashm, Turf a, Battha, and Batamm are wells belonging exclusively to the Murra tribe. (5) Arada is the first place belonging to the Manasir in the west between Banaiyan and Qufak-al-Liwa. i ti t • ( 6 ) Bainuna is a well belonging to the Manasir tribe, but othei Bedouin tribes use it. 6 . I hope that these details may be of interest to you and may ultimately help you to form a general idea about the frontier line, wnich will, in the end, lead to a satisfactory settlement of the issue.

[E 4218/318/25] Record of the Fourth Meetinq with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on 'July 5, 1935. THE following were present: Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Laithwaite, India Office. Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. I. The first subject to be discussed was the question of the eastern and south eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. Mr. RENDEL said that no further progress appeared for the moment to be possible, and that it was now for each side to consider the arguments put forward by the other. His Majesty’s Government, for their part, would await the statement which Fuad Bey had promised at the last meeting regarding the diras or tribal areas of the three and a half tribes claimed by Iving Abdul Aziz, with particular reference to the southern sector of the boundaiy proposed b} Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel said that it would be particularly useful if Fuad Bey could accompany this statement with a map which could show roughly (in, say, gradations of shading or colour) the areas claimed as exclusively, predominantly or onlv partially inhabited, or wandered over, by paiticular tribes. FUAD BEY HAMZA explained that he would have difficulty in meeting this latter request, but that he hoped shortly to have ready a list of over 150 names of wells, water-holes, &amp;c., showing to which tribes and sections oi sub-sections of tribes they were regarded as belonging. Mr RENDEL expressed the hope that the statement might be available as soon as possible; but he explained that it would, of course, have to be referred to the British authorities in the Gulf and at Aden, so that it might be some weeks before His Majesty’s Government could reply to it. Fuad Bey Hamza. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. II. Mr. RENDEL then said that he wished to speak to Fuad Bey about the Saudi blockade of Koweit, or rather, since Fuad Bey did not like that term about the problem of the economic relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. Me beo-an by outlining to Fuad Bey the information contained m the latest telegrams from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding the position reached in the local conference which had recently been taking place at Koweit between the delegates of the sheikh and those of King Abdul Aziz. It appeared from these telegrams that, while the King was ready to adopt the Sheikh of KoweR s suggestion of a customs and manifest system, he had instructed the baudi delegates to insist as a condition that the Sheikh of Koweit shone g lve a guarantee that no single smuggler from Koweit would be allowed to cross the border In the event of this guarantee failing on more than three occasions to prove effective, the Saudi Government would terminate any agreement reached. This guarantee the Koweit delegates had naturally been unable to give. They had however, promised to give instead an undertaking on Koweit s honour that Koweit would do her best to stop smuggling. At this stage the Saudi delegates had explained that they had no authority to go beyond the King s orders. They had consequently closed down the negotiations and returned to JNejd. [456 e- -1]'2 Mr Rendel pointed out that there was no legal obligation on a country having I low tariffs to prevent smuggling into a country whose tariffs were high. The problem was one of frequent occurrence and, to take an example on a very much I larger scale, had occurred between His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government in the days of prohibition in the United States. On that | occasion His Majesty’s Government, though under no legal obligation to prevent the export of liquor to the United States, had, in the interests of good lelations, j voluntarily agreed to come to an arrangement under which they co-operated to check liquor smuggling. In a small way the position was analogous m Koweit, where the sheikh had now offered to co-operate for the purpose of checking smu crc ding into Saudi Arabia. But it was quite impossible foi any country, e\en | the most highly organised, to guarantee not to allow a single smugglei thiough, j The Saudi Government’s demand could therefore only be described as | unreasonable. Mr. Rendel regretted that the conference should have broken down in this unsatisfactory manner when agreement appeared to have been reached on the main problem. He wished to repeat that this question of Koweiti-Saudi | relations was one to which His Majesty s Government attached particular JJ importance. It was one of the main objects of His Majesty’s Government to ■ ensure that Saudi relations with Koweit should now be regularised and set right i on the same lines as had been so successfully followed in the case of Saudi relations j first with Iraq and then with Transjordan. He hoped, therefore, that Fuad Bey might be able to arrange for the conference to be resumed. Mr. LAITHWAITE also stressed the desire of the Secretary of State for India and the Government of India to see this result achieved and the great j importance which they attached to the disposal of the question. As regards the j Saudi Government’s insistence on a guarantee, Mr. Laithwaite said that it seemed j clear from the history of the last few years that the Saudi Government were | in a position to impose an effective blockade on the land frontier of Koweit j and to deal with any persons who might be caught smuggling across that land | frontier That being so, a demand on Koweit for a guarantee such as had been suggested would seem, to say the least of it, superfluous. He drew Fuad Bey’s attention to the fact that if the Saudi Government’s demands were to be made public they could not fail to show King Abdul Aziz in an invidious light, and||j indeed might well give the impression that he was not really seeking a settlement. Mr Laithwaite added that the Saudi delegates difficulties in negotiating, even j with the help of the telegraph, were of course understood by His Majesty s Government, but he reminded Fuad Bey that Koweit was ready to promise j| on her honour to do her best to stop the smuggling, and he made it clear that I His Majesty’s Government for their part would do all in their power to ensure I that this undertaking was observed. He trusted therefore that Fuad Bey would 1 be able to suggest some way in which the Saudi Government could be induced to 1 relax their insistence on an absolute guarantee. I FUAD BEY HAMZA, in reply, explained that, while the Saudi Legation had received some information as to the progress of the negotiations at Koweit, I they were not yet in possession of full details as to the points on which those | negotiations had broken down. The information now given to him helped to make the position clearer. He now understood that the following proposals had I been made :— I la) A svstem of customs posts through which trade would be canalised. I {b) A system of manifests to be operated in conjunction with the system i of customs posts. I (c) An honourable undertaking by Koweit to do all she could to prevent smuggling across the Saudi border. I This having been confirmed, Fuad Bey undertook to make enquiries by tele graph of his Government and expressed the hope that he would shortly be in a position to make some statement on the matter. At this point Mr. Laithwaite withdrew. III. The meeting then proceeded to discuss the future of the Treaty of Jedda and the connected question of the suggested abandonment by His Majesty* Government of their right of manumission./—^ I 3 'Coiintrfj, ere 0! ia% and tkt; tales, |, atioitoj, •Nii f co-opeg. gonsiii| l nggler 4 e desctjj a^ebrofe; ten Kg t Koweitij ched put! * GoTerif «d andsft; f Saudis &gt;, that Fui ary of 8ti d and ki As re»i id that its jOTernier across tk. such as ki Irew Fill were to k: power toe Fuad Bey 7 ild be ini® he canals withthf^ joold to F Mr. REND EL said that he wished first of all to dispose of a misunder standing to which Fuad Bey had given expression in conversation with Sir L. Oliphant on the previous day. It appeared that Fuad Bey had gained the impression during the conversations which were held in London in September 1934, that His Majesty’s Government had declared their willingness to renew the Treaty of Jedda in the manner now proposed by the Saudi Government, but that Fuad Bey had now found, to his surprise and regret, that they had since changed their minds. Mr. Rendel said he was satisfied, and had confirmed from the records of the 1934 conversations, that Fuad Bey was under a misapprehension on this point. His Majesty’s Government had never taken any decision about the future of the Treaty of Jedda,and had not gone back on anything that had been said to Fuad Bey on that subject last year. He cited once more the three possibilities which had been discussed in 1934 and which had again been quoted by Sir A. Ryan at the meeting held on the 2nd July. Of these three, the negotiation of an entirely new treaty covering all points at issue and drawn up in accordance with present conditions naturally seemed the most workmanlike. This could, however, only take place when the major questions now outstanding had been settled, and as it now looked as though a settlement of these questions might take longer than had at first been anticipated, the conclusion of such a new comprehensive treaty might in consequence be delayed for a considerable time. This being so he could see no objection in principle to the prolongation of the present treaty in the way suggested by Fuad Bey Hamza, if agreement could be reached in regard to any modifications of the provisions of the Jedda settlement which it was desired at the same time to introduce. Mr. Rendel reminded Fuad Bey that it had been agreed at a previous meeting that the principal topic to be discussed before the Jedda settlement could be prolonged and amended m this way was the question of slavery in relation to His Majesty s right of manumission. He drew attention once more to the strength of public and parliamentary opinion in this country on the subject of slavery, and of the important influence of the anti-slavery societies. It was therefore essential that His Majesty s Government should be able to justify any decision which they might reach to abandon their right of manumission, on the lines contemplated in the original exchange of notes, by being able to show that a new situation now existed in Arabia which rendered the maintenance of that right inappropriate or unnecesaiy. He added, speaking personally and unofficially, that the draft anti-slavery regulations which Fuad Bey had communicated privately to Sir A. Ryan seemed to him to provide a hopeful basis for further discussion. It had not yet, however, been possible to submit the details of these proposals to the Secretary of State and it would be necessary, before any undertaking could be given to the Saudi Government, to submit to Sir Samuel Hoare a detailed statement showing the precise scope of the proposed Saudi regulations. It was only thus that Ministers would be able to judo-e whether the new arrangements would be sufficient to enable them to make an adequate defence in Parliament for the abandonment by His Majesty s Government of this important and well-known right. Mr. Rendel suggested that it would be of great assistance from the point of view of further progress if Fuad Bey Hamza could give a firm undertaking that King Abdul Aziz would, when the time came, be ready to promulgate regulations on the lines of those now under discussion. SIR ANDREW RYAN then explained the progress which he had been able ,o make on the previous day in a conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza (see ;eparate record in E 4163/325/25) and gave it as his opinion, subject to one or wo difficult points, that a promising position had now been reached as regards ilavery There were, however, other points which needed considei ation in lonnexion with the future of the Treaty of Jedda, some of which had already &gt;een raised by the Saudi Government. He mentioned the question of the arms traffic as an example. He pointed out, however, that if only m view of tlm close juestioning which His Majesty’s Government must be prepared to face, the iroblem of slavery was the most serious. FUAD BEY HAMZA again pressed for an assurance that His Majesty s Government would in principle be prepared to prolong the Treaty of Jedda. Mr RENDEL replied that, while he was not yet authorised to give a formal issurance to this effect, he did not think that His Majesty s Government would [456 e—1] B 2be likely to raise an y plrty luwlenouncVirT^at'of S amount to a declaration that neither P art y “'j befol , e&gt; agr e e ment could be reacMon any modTficaUon in the provisions of the settlement which the Saudi Government wished to take this opportunity to secure. The discussion then reverted to the question of slavery and manumission. FUAD BEY H^^^^tTienthe^woTarfe. ^realYsed tfat Hk which . 1 .. S.c.d, G» = . MjM doubted, however, ^S^toHis Majesty’!

FUAD BEY HAMZA explained that the Sa “ d U^ 0 ^™®^ g Government private guarantee that if the legislation were passed His Majesty would then abandon their right of manumission. SIR A. RYAN restated the procedure, which he bn!. 6 nriwite but binding ifis Majesty’s Government would i;enounce the ygyb^hUrrenundation of the I’gZ U of rnulissfon Ts plrf of suggested arrangements for prolonging the validity of the Treaty of Jedda. Mr RENDER saw no difficulty in regard to the private suggested bv Fuad Bey provided His Majesty’s Government were sat y s h d t imrossible as actually need ratification, and Parliament was not technically eonceu e ratifications it would be necessary for any new agreement to be laid beto on wouV thente a r ble C to Indg^hThe? thaUegi^S parliamentary criticism and^^o carry th^^odification of ‘'Zr mstruZnt whe^had been ratified would itself need ratification- ie whether the proposed exchange of notes would have to ^ subject to rati^ tion—was a question somewhat outside his proMnce, on \\hich t | advice would be obtained.FUAD BEY HAMZA then said that if His Majesty’s Government, rather than prolong the Treaty of Jedda as proposed, preferred to wait until an entirely new treaty could be negotiated, or for any other reason did not wish to prolong the treaty in the manner now proposed, the Saudi Government would not object. In that event, he suggested that the question of slavery and manumission could be simply dealt with in a separate exchange of notes without bringing in the Treaty of Jedda at all. Mr. RENDEL pointed out that this was an entirely new suggestion, and doubted whether it would be a satisfactory one. In practice the Jedda settlement, i.e., the Treaty of Jedda and notes attached thereto, had always been treated as a whole. There might well be serious objections to any attempt to deal with the settlement piecemeal, and he thought that His Majesty’s Government would probably prefer Fuad Bey’s original suggestion, that the Treaty of Jedda should be prolonged and agreed modifications introduced by an exchange of notes covering all the ground. This led to a further discussion of the prolongation or modification of the exchange of notes (Nos. 5 and 6 ) regarding purchases of arms by the Saudi Government. Mr. RENDEL suggested, and FUAD BEY agreed, that this was a point of form rather than of substance. There was no question of His Majesty’s Govern ment treating the Saudi Government in a less favourable way than any other friendly country in a similar position. The question of arms traffic was not dealt with in his department, and he would have to consult the competent authorities before saying more than this. By the words c ‘ in a similar position ” he meant there were certain countries where, in the interests of the Governments concerned, it had been internationally agreed that arms should only be supplied to the Governments themselves or to importers specifically approved by those Govern ments. The intention of this arrangement had been to prevent arms being used by rebel tribesmen, and he cited the revolt of Ibn Rifada as one where the limitation of the import of arms to approved importers operated to the advantage of King Abdul Aziz. If then there were some such general international limitation applicable to countries in the same position as Saudi Arabia, he did not think any difficulty need be caused by provision being made for it in any arrangements between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government. It would be time enough, however, to decide what were the most suitable arrange ments on this point when agreement had been reached on the main question of the prolongation of the Jedda settlement and of the abandonment of His Majesty s Government’s right of manumission. An allusion was also made to the question of the prevailing language of the treaty. Mr. RENDEL said that this was also mainly a formal and technical point on which the competent authorities would have to be consulted in due course. At the conclusion of the meeting SIR A. RYAN undertook to produce a single comprehensive statement of the position reached in his discussions on slavery with Fuad Bey, showing the lines on which the Saudi Government might be prepared to legislate. Steps might also be taken, he thought, to consult other departments of the Foreign Office regarding the arms tiaffic and the technical questions of form that had been mentioned.By Air Mail. P.Z .

Sir, i am directed, by Mi** Secretary MacDonald to acknowledge the receipt of your letter Bo* S # 4111/77/91 of the 12th July, regarding the letter which the Deputy Oaudi-Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to Mr.Hendel on the 2nd July on the subject of the territorial claims of King Xbn Saud in eastern and South Eastern Arabia.

Mr* Macdonald feels that a fuller explanation of the Saudi Arabian claim then appears in Fuad bey Hamza* s letter of the 2nd July is required before the matter can be adequately considered. 3, It is, however, understood from Fuad Bey Hamza’s letter that while King Ibn Saud does not claim the allegiance of certain tribes which form part of the Aden Protectorate, he is not prepared to abandon his claim to the frontier described in the memorandum vhieh was handed by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 3rd April last. In this connection attention is invited to the telegram of the 29th March from the Resident at Aden, a copy of which was enclosed in this Department* s letter of the 4th April, in which he suggested that the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Aden Protectorate should be a straight line drawn from the intersection of parallel 18 with the “violet line* to the intersection of parallel 20 with meridan 55. Without further consultation with the authorities in Aden the Secretary nder Secretary of State, of Foreign Office, S*w.l*2 . of State could not agree to any further concession being offered to Ibn Baud in this section of the frontier. 4* I am to request that any reply to the letter from the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs may take account of the considerations advanced in the preceding paragraph. 8, A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office.

Political Agency, Bahrain, the 18th August 1935. Salih al Hani*, Secretary of the Shaikh of Qatir, has been at Bahrain during tne past week and I have iika the opportunity of meeting and talking to him alone for - bout two hour hours. I was rather loath to broach tne subject of the wells in the Al Rami in view of his being a hajdi. However, he was so interested in the money making propensities of oil and so anxious to know the royalties that His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad was receiving on each ship load of oil, th*t in view of his obvious acquisitive desire I thought it safe to broach the subject. I askeo him if the Al Rami was uiiaer Bin Sa ! ud. He said 'no'. I then asked him if it belonged to Qatar or to Abu Dhabi. He said neither and tnat it was virtually in independent state belonging to the Al Hurrah. I then asked him who was the leaser of tne Al Muiiran in the event of anyone wishing to open negotiations with them* He said tnat tuey had no principal leader such asthe Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast and they were entirely independent and sections in the tribe were independent of each other. I t^en asked him if he thought the Al Rami had mineral possibil ities. he replied that he tnought that there might be oil there. 1 tnen asked him if oil was discovered to whom would it belong. He replied that if it was nearer the Qatar /frontier Honourable Lt.=Coionel Gordon Loch, e Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.2 . frontier, i.e., Khor al Odaid to Dohat al Salwah, it woula belong to Qatar ana if nearer Bin Sa ! ua ? s it woula belong to uin Sa T ua. I tnen arew a rough, sketcn and put my pencil in the miadle oi the Al Rami ana said suppose oil is here is tnat Bin Sa T ud T s or Qatar T s? He replied Qatar’s. I then asked where was Bin Sa’ud’s boundary. He saia tiiat he was uncertain but probably beyond Banaiyan. 2. The above conversation clearly proves wnat I have written and my deductions as reported to you in my official letter No:C/436-l.a/38 dated the 15th August 1935. I am sure that Qatar is the only wry at present by whicn we can hope to substantiate any claims over tne wells in the Al Rami and provided the Shaikh is handled properly and his acquisitive propensities sharpened sufficiently I think we can nope at any rate if not to substantiate our claim at least to prevent Bin Sa’ud from making out a case. I gathered that provided the Al Murrah were never allowed to think tnere wasany intention on tne part of His Majesty’s Government to claim a sphere of influence in their country, i.e., the Al Rami in which they live, they would always resist the claim of Bin Sa’ua to sovereignty onver them. If, however, at this stage the hi Murrah became in the least suspicious of our intentions they would certainly resist us and support Bin Sa’ud.CONFIDENTIAL, The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his com pliments to The Political Agent, Bahrain. and hss the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned docu ment (4- British Consulate-General, Name and Date.

But as people of those countries were looked after by the British and chose to be in their present state and as the British were his friends he had not pressed that view 'so we left the question of tbs towns only, hut no one (i.e. no Trucial Chief) has any right to claim anything or property in the desert or among the tribes nor had anyone's father or grandfather claimed such a right'. Bin Sa'ud does not wish to deny to anyone any thing for which he is responsible or which he can protect but 'things which are beyond his control and in which he has no interests, we cannot allow them to pass to any other person 1 *. (ill)//5£ - 2 - (lii) Secondiy, British claim to have had a treaty with the Turks and the Turks allowed taem some lands# Bin Sa*ud had inidroied British (a) that Turks did not exercise authority or control in those lands nor did they keep order in Has a or its vicinity (b) that alleged treaty signed only alter he had occupied Hasa and (c) that it was not ratified so tha^he does not recognise it* (iv) The object md urgency or hie letter are that he has heard that an oil company have applied to Shaikh for concession* Once the boundary is fixed Shaikh will be at liberty to do what he likes. Bin Sa*ud requests Shaikh to postpone mat car till boundary between him and British is settled or to ask British either (a) to let him aid Shaikh settle boundary without their mediation or ( b ) to set Lie boundary with him (Bin Sa’ud) themselves. H I have explained this to you our brother in order that you may be aware that if the C ore p ny starts any work or drilling before the boundaries are settled* we will be compelled to protest and to stop operations aixl fortoid anything toeing done until tnajmattera between us and them are settled' 1 . (v) Xn two places there^Ls reference to understanding between him end Shaikh apparently over boundary, tout Shaikh denies having committed himself • 2.

Bin Saud wields some authority over the Manasir through their paramount chief who lives in Hasa and has occasion ally extracted zakat from other tribes even up to Bahraimi I think that it is fair to put it that his personal prestige and that of Jiluwi gives him considerable influence but (except in case of Manasir) hardly authority even to the east of the A1 Morrah area. This influence rapidly dwindles as one moves eastwards and I do not think that he exercises any authority over Muscat Oman Sultan told Bremner what he considered boundaries of Bhufar there are three plateaux or ranges of hills tribes 2 In informal conversation in October 1934 Sultanate.

But in the present delicate situation in the Red Sea they desire to avoid driving Ibn Saud/towards the Italians ior support which they would be only too ready to offer end which he might accept - notwithstanding the obvious dangers to himself - if he felt he were being hardly treated by Kie Majesty’s Government# 3 # 2 n the circumstances you may, subject to the views of the Government of India and of lolitical Resident lour telegrams 161, 163 and 169.

Hla Majesty’s Government* when they learned of his letter were about to address the Saudi Government in regard to their action in corresponding direct with the Shaikh of v s.tar on a subject which since His Majesty* s Government are responsible for the Shaikh* g foreign reietionr., falls within their sphere* You should then make a coimaunication as instructed in paragraph 3 of my telegram 104 introducing a reference to the ^iote quoted in Ryan T s telegram No.39* 5* You should then explain that after long negotiations in which His Majesty’s Government participated and which they saw no reason to dealy, Shaikh of Qatar on the 17th May last granted to the Anglo-Percian Oil Company, with the full approval of Hio Hajesty's Government, concession for exploitation of oil etc., in hie territory. As Saudi Government have been informed. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are prepared in derogation of their strict legal rights to offer the Saudi(s) important concessions at the northern end of the .rentier line and to admit Saudi sovereignty up to the so called 'Green Line' of which you should repeat the definition. But as was pointed out to Fuad Bey in London last June this line represents the utmost concession which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are able to offer in this area compatibly with their obligations to other Rulers concerned. Reasons why his Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom ca e unabj-e to contemplate further conceesions in this sector were fully explained to Fuad.6. southern limit of cil concession granted to Anglo-Perslan Oil Company by Shaikh of c^atar not only does not extend beyond thie Green Line but lies to a considerable distance to the north* of it. Concession does not therefore extend to any territory under discussion with Saudi Government# 7. Moreover His Majesty*' Government in the United Kingdom have formally assured Shaikh of qatar of their protection against any interference with his territorial rights - more particularly over area covered by concession. In view of language of Ibn Saud’s letter to Shaikh of Qatar, His ^ajesty*s Government rau.st make this point clear and draw Saudi Governments attention to terms of Article 6 of Treaty of Jedda by which Ibn S&amp;ud undertook inter alia to maintain friendly relations with the shaikh of Qatar, whose special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government he specifically recognises. 8 . In these circumstances the frontier question cannot be affected by the grant or exploitation of thds concession. For your own information grant of a concession could not in any case prejudice legal rights of either party over territory to which it purports to extend. 9. You should add that His ^jesty’s Government appreciate and reciprocate Saudi Government’s desire to reach early agreement on the frontier question and that they hope that discussion on this subject may be profitably resumed on Ryan’s return to Arfebia. - secretary of state fcr - FOREIGN AFFAIRS{ T CONFIDENTIAL.

Dated 30th September (received let October) 1935. IIOOTIATB . Your air mail letter of September 5th Ho.676-S and previous correspondence regarding south eastern bo ndaries of SaHidl Arabia, In the light of information now available His Majesty’s Government feel that it is impossible to disregard effective authority of I bn Sa’ud over Al Murra or to attempt any settlement which does not take this fact into account. They also feel that there may be a reasonable prospect of reaching early settlement if Sir A. Ryan, during personal visit to Ibn Sa’ud, makes a final offer in as generous terms as circumstances permit. Such an offer would in effect (though not of course formally) give him Murra dira while preserving areas in Horth in regard to which for familiar reasons no compromise is possible, 2. Eastern boundary might run from point in the neighbourhood of SARKK&amp;T MIJORA (which would be on Sa* udi side) approximately up to meridian 54 to its intersection with perallel 23. 3, Xn regard to northern section it is desired to fix certain key points on which line could hinge* These would be based on principle laid down in paragrepn 1 end should if possible be well recognised points in regard to which our claim can /2 can be supported by convincing argument (e*g* collection of iak&amp;t by Shaikh or predominant use by our tribes)# 4* Following suggestion has been put forward. Line would leave DOEAT-£S-SAL#?A s&amp;y four miles from ^ASR-ES-FALtfA vis. a little to the north of green line but south of ^atar concession boundary - and would go straight to western end of SAMKAT EL AMRA (key point A). This would give a small further concession to Ibn S&amp;’ud in an area to which he attaches great importance and would not abandon any territory claimed by Shaikh of qatar. Kx&amp;ct point of departure on coast would have to be determined in the light of local consideration e.g. physical features. From point A line would run approximately due south to a second point B where it would join northern edge of Murra dira as defined by Dickson. Aells at DHUWAIHIE shown on Major Cheesman’s map have been suggested as possible point B. Thence boundary would run south east in straight line to join eastern line at a point mentioned in paragraph 2 above# 5. Such a line would be at some distance from sea and would apparently safeguard rights of Shaikh but it is not clear without further information (») If Bhuws Ihin is .atisfactory point to work on (it la only .narked with a query in Cheeaman'a map and not at all in Thomas's while in Lorimer it is given as within boundary of A^iU) or if one of Thomas' e wells e.g. NAKHA1A or HALUWA1N would not be preferable? « (b) what would be position of SUFAK# It might be necessary to make this well also a key point on line if in view of considerations such as that in (b) of your telegram of 10th July Ko#622 it can be shown to be definitely within sphere of/Abu Dhabi outside Hurra d 11 *&amp; #t }Cjy' -3- 6* Sir A# Ryan leaves London towards the end of October, It is therefore necessary to teke firm decisions on key points. His Majesty’s Government would be glad if subject to concurrence of Government of India you could now take immediate steps to make what local investigations are necessary for this purpose. If you cannot give definite reply in time without deputing special officer for investigations you may consider desirability of sending Dickson down urgently to make personal survey on the spot possibly with aid of aircraft. You will observe that area in question is small and survey could no doubt be made rapidly and without difficulties referred to in paragraph 1 of your air mail letter of August 31st C/267 ? # Object of survey would be limited to clearing up definition of minimum number of key points for line roughly dividing Murra dira from territory of qatar and Abu Dhabi between say meridians 51 and 52 taking itito account desirability of meeting Ibn Ba’ud as fares possible without giving him access to sea to east of Qatar or to any territory legitimately claimed by Shaikhs, It should be borne in mind that line based 0 n these points would be a line on which we should definitely take o^ stand to admittance of letting negotiations break down rather than recede from it and should therefore so iar as possible be one which we can defend by convincing arguments on tribal basis even though we do not accept this basis tae only or main factor in fixing boundary. 8 . If you and Government of India agree how soon do you estimate that necessary particulars could be furnished.Telegram xx From Political Resident, in H.jyUS*Lupin* To / ir Officer Commanding, Hinaidi* Copy handed to Senior H&amp;val Officer, Persian Gulf.

If you do not feel able to express any such views now please how soon you could arrange for personal enquiry to me made of Shaikh vrho should be left in no doubt of use to which required information will be put vis-a-vis Bir Saud.

Resident returned the call of Shaikh Hazze*, the brother of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, on shore, he told \ him that he came to Abu Dhabi on business and that he ih^fiommed Shaikh Shakhbut that he was arriving Abu Dhabi on the 7th instant. That as Shaikh Shakhbut was not present he wanted himtHazza*) to give him a man who would be able to tell the names of the wells and places on the Qatar-Abu Dhabi frontier* Shaikh Hazza* replied that as his brother was away he could not assume the responsibility of sending one and asked thit the matter should be left till the return of Shaikh Shakhbut. The P.R. said that he could not wait as he had important work to do and that he was leaving for Doha., from where he would take t, man and view the wells from the air. He hdded that it would be better if Shaikh Hazza* sent a man from Abu Dhabi to help in locating the places in question, which would be in the interests of Abu Dhabi. That if he did not send a man to assist and places were not correctly identifiet it would not be in the interests of Abu Dhabi and that they should not afterwards blame the Government. Shaikh Hazza* said that as he was not the ruler he coulc not take the responisibility and that the matter should be left till the return of the Shaikh. A bedouin from the A1 Manasir tribe was then called and asked by the P.R. about certain places, of which he(P.R.) made a note. The P.R. then suggested that Shaikh Hazza* should think over the matter and that he was leaving me behind to get his final reply* fter the departure of the P.R. to the ship2 Shaikh Hazza* conferred with his brother Khalid and Ahmad bin 'tJt&amp;ibah for more than two hours and although they sought to convince him that there was nothing to fear and urged him to send © nun, he declined to do so, saying that he could not take upon himself the responsibility.

M p Subject. Doha reconnais^arc*1!^ Note I arrived at Qatar and sent the Head Munshi on shore to explain to Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Jasim that we had exchanged calls quite recently and that as ray business was pressing I proposed not to trouble him to pay a call but that I would come on shore in the cool of the evening to dircuss one or two matters with him. 2, I instructed the Head Munshi when giving this message wells from the air. The Shaikh, however, was unable to help us because in the case of his own subjects he did not like to send them because we would be going over what he regarded as his border and he did not want to run any risk of creating trouble for himself. He said that he tried to persuade two A1 Murrah to go with us but that they fled on hearing that they were expected to go over that area and to go up in an aeroplane. It was clearly useless to press the matter so I contented myself in limiting the scope of our reconnaissance. 3. men I visited Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Jasim in the evening he said much the same to me. 4. I conveyed to Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Jasim the reply of Grovernment that they had told Bin Sa’ud that they bad given the Shaikh a promise of protection and that correspondence on such matters should be through ilis Majesty’s Government. The Sheikh was, I think, grateful for the message but I think that even now he is a little doubtful whether, when the time comes, His Majesty’s Government will actually afford him protection. . 1 J. T ^ wi +Vi nnf! crivincr awRV the fact protection is a genuine one. The truth its that s;nce IC'VV /that we wanted two men to tell us the names of various the /the fete of the Shaikh of Mohammerah no one trusts any promise of protection that we give. 6* I asked the Shaikh whether he had had any reply from Bin Sa’ud and he (I think rather grudgingly) admitted that he had but asked what reply he should send \ I said that if he wished to give e polite reply to this last communication he could just say that he had seen/and understood that His Majesty’s Government had addressed the Sa’udi Government on the subject. 7. Three officers of H.M.S.Lupin and I dined with Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Jasim. 8. On the 11th October 1955 I proceeded from Dohah at 07.00 hours in a Victoria (Squadron Leader Dand) to carry out the proposed reconnaissance. Programme of the reconnaissance is attached. Flight Lieutenant Ooates and Flight Lieutenant Lott (his successor) were present. We fixed by direction finding $ASR SALWA, SAKAK, AI&amp;BAK, and the .vest shore of Khor DHUWAIHIH and Khor * ODAID. Accual plotting of the*e positions is awaited from the Royal Air Force.
