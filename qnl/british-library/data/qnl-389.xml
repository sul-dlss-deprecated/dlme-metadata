We proceeded to the premises of the consignee and called for shipping invoices shipping samples and sample the shipment of the said Mulls. The first two were provided and three hundred and ten pieces of the latter were presented for examination.

We examied the pieces with the shipping samples and found that they were not the same in that the strength of tne materialof the shipment was inferior to that of the shipment samples. No outwadard signs of damage by external causes were evident. We also examined the ends of the pieces for lot numbers and found on the majority the following marks- 231 J M S 18788-.

Bahrein# I beg to bring before your kind attention a complaint I have against my shipper Mr# J# M# Shaeha ol lanchestsr on the subject of certain shipments of Mulls sent to me against an order placed with him and placed on previous shipments which were upto standard quality# The shipments I complain of are 5 7 bales comprising 1050 pieces Mulls shipred A K from Manchester per S£&gt;# Kohistan on 27th i ov#«51# Do. 7 bales comprising 1050 pieces Mulls shipped from Manchester per SS.Tabaristan on 51st Dec#51. Do# 13 bales comprising 1887 pieces Mulls shipped from Manchester per S.S. City of Durban on 29th Feb.32. 27 bales Total comprising 3987 pieces White Mulls# and my complaint is this that the quality of these goods is defective in that the strength of the material is inferior both to the previous shipment on which I based my order accor ding to Indent No.5 dated 13th September 1930 and to the shipping samples submitted by Mr# J#M# Shasha at the time of shipment. The first shipment was sold to clients on wholesale and therefore I had no immediate knowledge of the defectiveness of the goods* Moreover I had 60 days sight documents on the poods and they were not cleared from the customs immediately on arrival. In the meantime the other shipments came forward and I had no time to intervene. Further my customers did not become awa&amp;re of the cefectiv eness until after they had retailed the goods. It was then that complaints poured in to me. These complaints were received while the last shipment was in Customs and I drew the atten tion of the Manager of The Eastern Bank Ltd. to the defective ness of the goods and stated that I had no desire to take up the gooda now pending. He pointed out to me that I must honour my drafts and ape place my complaints afterwards. Moreover, in consideration of my previous dealigs with the above shipper I honoured the drafts against this l*t ship ments. I wrote to him on this matter on 2nd July 1932 and he replied eventually vide his letter dated 30th September 1932 that I should in his openion call for a Lloyd’s Survey. This I did vide copy of Certificate No#17 dated 11th October 1932 attached# The apparent delay between the time of arrival of shipments and Survey is due to time taken by correspondence with shipper.When I submitted the Lloyd*s Certificate, the shipper stated that certain particulars were lacking in this Certificate, vide his letter of 19th Oct#1932, which would establish a claim, as he states, against his finishers who apparently aere responsible to him for the defectiveness of the goods* In hie letter of 50th Nov.52 he asked to have all the letter of complaints certified so that he should submit to his finishers as proof of defectiveness of the goods, in lieu of Lloyd’s Agents Certificate. I sent to him the ce rtified true copy of comrlaints from the majority of my clients whose attestations I could obtain in the Magistrate’s Court. I regret I could not obtain the presence of the otner clients as they were unavailable but T received letters from them which I submitted in original to Tr. J. a. Bhasha on 4th Feb. 1933 and these acknowledged by him in his letter of 10th ’farch 1933 in which he pointed out to me that those testifica tions related to the signature and th^t I must obtain a certificate from a person in authority who hos actually seen and examined the condition of the goods, Moreover, to obtain such a certificate I approached you verbally in this matter and as per your advice Ur. Bayed Abdulhay K.B., Mr. Abdulaziz Ali Albassam and Mr. J. Russel (Lloyd's Agent) called to my premises to examine and report on the goods in accordance with the desire of the shipper. Copy of all correspondence are also attached for your kind perusal.

S./to: Sir I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to inform you that careful consideration v?as immediately given by the Department of Overseas Trade to the facts reported by the Political Agent at Bahrein in his despatch No.C/£59 of July 10th, a copy of which was sent to you direct* You will recollect that the subject of the despatch concerned a dispute between the firm of Messrs. Muhammad and Ali Jamal Khunji and the Manchester hous?e of Mr*J*M*Shasha. of Overseas Trade to intervene directly with British firms, no matter how well proved their malpractices may be. In the present instance it therefore seemdd preferable to enlist the informal co-operation of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, and this has accordingly been done. 3 . At an interview with Mr.James Ainsley, an assistant secretary of that body, it was explained to him that the Department fully shared the apprehensions of the Political Agent regarding the deplorable effect on British trade which any proceedings in the Court would certainly involve. You will recollect that the Political Agent has since addressed a further despatch on this aspect of the matter to the Department Afo i 3f. It is always a matter of difficulty to the Department subject of Japanese competition is,at this moment, vividly / present •*• Dt .—C ol.P. G-.looh, Acting British Consul General,present to the minds oil the tia no heater Chamber owing to the presence, In this oonntry, of a delegation of Japanese Indne- trlallats who are, as yon are no doubt aware, negotiating with certain Lancashire industrialists In the -natter. 4. Advantage was, therefore, taken of the presence of lir.Alnaley In the Department to emphasise the effect which an incident of this sort would be likely to have from the point of view of Japanese competition and it was quite clear that Mr.Alnsley appreciated this point. 5 . He then adked what steps the Department considered could be taken by hie Chamber. As to this he was told that the Department would prefer to leave him a completely free hand regarding the manner In which ho and his colleagues might choose to deal with Ur.Shaeha. The kind of action which had occurred to the Department as possible was that some well- known figure In the cotton Industry should seek an occasion for a private interview with Ur.Bhasha and speak to him directly and gravely regarding the consequences of action of the kind alle geX- 6, Mr.Ainsley thought that this would be possible and might, indeed, Drove to be the best means to adopt. He ex plained, however, that the samples enclosed In the 2olitioal gent's deapatoh were apparently only samples Of the badness , of the cloth actually supplied,- | of the class ordered, they hardly afforded him the moans of testing definitely whether the goods supplied were. In fact.nf a quality similar to that of the goods ordered. 7 . l am to add. for your confidential information, that the firm of Ur.J.M.Shasha have long been known to this Department. Ht.J.H.Sl-Mha Is a naturalised British subject - he was formerly an Ottoman (Spanish Jew) - and the arrives of the Department / are ••••o «• 3 — \ are full of numerous requests, received from |iim during the past ten years, for assistance in the Persian Gulf, in'Iraq and in Persia, in collecting overdue accounts. ! At one tine his business was considered to be comparatively prosperous, but his reputation is evil and at present any request for assistance received from him is regarded with the greatest caution. On the other band, ’Ir.Shasha forms one of a considerable class of persons of Asiatic extraction who reside in Manchester and form the normal vehicle for the commerce in cotton goods between the United Kingdom and the Middle East. To decline, in all oases, to render him assistance would, therefore, re-act to the detriment of the British cotton industry. Bearing this consideration in mind, all applications received from him are now treated on their merits, frequently being refused. The Foreign Office have, at the same time, laid down, for the guidance of certain of His Ua^esty , s Consular Officers in Persia, that some measure of discretion should be left to them to decide in each case v/hat assistance should be rendered to Mr.Shasba. 8 . These remarks regarding the standing of Mr.Shasha are mentioned,in the present instance, in order to make it plain that it may be possible to bring a certain amount of pressure to bear on him since he is so constant an applicant for Departmental assistance. It will, however, not be possible to use this lever with him until the Ilanohester Chamber of Commerce have satisfied themselves that the facts of the case are as alleged. 9 .

Yon will also see, from the reply- dated September 29th from Mr*Ainsley to Mr.J.U.Shasha,that the Chamber consider that the Political Agent at Bahrein should put this offer before Messrs•Muhaimad and Ali Jamal Khnnji. 5* Bearing in mind the traditional practice of oriental markets, it occurs to the Department of Overseas Trade that it might be more convenient if, in the first instance, the Political Agent endeavoured to induce Messrs, Muhammad and Ali Jamal Khunji to accept settlement at a figure of £150; in that case he would be provided with a margin for increasing the offer if the course of negotiations rendered this desirable, 6 * I am to add that, at an interview between Mr,Ainsley and a member of this Department, Mr,Ainsley was informed, in answer to a request that the Department should give some opinion about the proposed settlement, that it considered that the best plan was certainly to offer a cash settlement but that it could, of course, express no opinion regarding the merits or otherwise of the particular sum offered, I am.

Dear Sir, Claim Lodged by Messrs.Mohamed &amp; Ali Jamal Khnnji With reference to my interview with yon concerning the above matter, I beg to inform yon that I have discussed this matter thoroughly with my Bleachers and they firmly repudiate the claim submitted by my client. They maintain that it is absolutely impossible for more than a few pieces to be effected which is proved by the evidence and patterns in their possession. I have explained to my Bleachers exactly the position and the manner in which our business has been jeopardised through this affair and although they emphatically repudiate the claim put forward they have expressed thsir willingness, in my interests, to make a compromisory settle ment by offering £200.without prejudice, to end this affair once and for all time. As I have already explained to you, the patterns representing the shipments in my possession are absolutely perfect, so also are the Bleachers in consequence of which I hope that Hessrs.Khunji will appreciate the generous manner in which the Bleachers have responded in the spirit of goodwill and the desire to re-establish the business relation ship.

Shasha &amp; Company of this city. In my letter of the 20th December I informed you tnat I would report the contents of your letter to Mr* Shasha. This I did, and I later confirmed the matter in writing. He called round to see me the other day and expressed his disappointment that the question has not been settled on the basis of the offer he made in his letter of September 27th, 1933. He finally came to the conclusion tnat he would have to state a time limit when that offer would cease to operate. 1 suggested that he should put his decision in writing and this he has done. I enclose a copy of his letter to me of January 2nd, from which you will observe that he requests that the Department will arrange for the client to be notified that unless the offer contained in Messrs* Shasha's letter of the 27th September is accepted, without prejudice, by the 15th February, 1934, it is to be with drawn. In the light of this, you will doubtless arrange for a communication to be sent to the Political Agent in Bahrain at the earliest possible moment.

I have considered this matter earnestly and I think that the offer set out in my letter of September 27th last is a very fair one indeed and, under the circumstances, one that the client should accept without hesitation. I can accept no responsibility for any claim unless the goods are returned to this country. long time and I shall therefore be much obliged if you will write out to the Department of Overseas Trade requesting them to notify the client that unless the offer contained in my letter of the 27th September is accepted, without prejudice, by the 15th of February next, it is to be withdrawn. ^his matter has already been outstanding a Thanking you for your kindly intervention Yours faithfully, (Signed) J.M.

Your letter of 11th October has never reached me otherwise it would certainly have been attended to, you know that always your correspondence is promptly dealt with. Wth regard to the Mulls, I, too, am sorry that no settlement has been arrived at but I can assure you it has been through no fault of mine. It is impossible for any claim to be accepted unless the actual evidence is produced, and if you are able to return the ^oods damaged to this Country, settlement will be arrived at without the slightest possible delay. I hope therefore that you will look upon this matter in a sensible way and realise that instead of recuperating our losses by delaying matters in this way we are losing further. We both need one another for the future business and we are allowing foolish obstacles come between. I can assure you that it is my personal desire to see the end of this unpleasentness between us so A that we can both divert our attention to more profitable business. I do not understand the meaning of your last sentence ' We are glad that you have recovered a large sum from the Finishers ' I have not received a penny from them otherwise I should have been only too glad to nave informed you* In your interests I have worked very hard *n this claim and it has enly oeen the lack of substantiary evidence that has been the obstacle. Apart from the loss of business I have been involved in very heavy expenses in my efforts to get this claim settled so that we may be able to resume our former pleasant relationship, I hope that it will not be long before it is x settled, I take this opportunity of conveying m very best wishes for 1934 hoping it will bring you every HAPPlWEoS and PROSPERITY and that our past relationship will be resumed on as pleasant a line as hitherto - bringing a larger volume of business to our mutual benifet.

Khedouri, who has come to Bahrein has apnroached us several times with a view to settle our claim. He has^also offered to us £250/- on your behalf as per your instruction but we regret that we could not*accent this amount*as it is too little compares to £he loss we have made on these defective White Mulls which you have shipped to us.
