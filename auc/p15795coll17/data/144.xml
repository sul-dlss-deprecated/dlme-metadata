Bonnah explains how he came to enroll at AUC over parental objections, and what it was like to study in its English Language Institute. He looks back on fondly on the AUC of the 1960s and 1970s, as an intimate downtown campus and for offering as well as a place that offered the opportunity for free expression of ideas and social life often at odds with the wider Egyptian society. His description of the student body reveals social divides between elites (like “local foreigners”) and Egyptians from less elevated social classes, with different ways of speaking, and those from outside Cairo like the Delta-born Bonnah. He credits Dean of Students Frank Blanning for offering support for the personal challenges Bonnah faced. His participation as editor of the Caravan student newspaper is covered in depth, including the production of the paper, the role of the faculty advisor, dealing with the Egyptian censor’s office, and balancing coverage of campus issues with concern for shielding AUC from outside criticism. Student political engagement and activism is also addressed. Bonnah tells of his position as the men’s (Falaki Street) dormitory supervisor, and recalls student activities and the social life on campus (including the Miss AUC competition), and his friendships with American study-abroad students. Bonnah explains his controversial switch from majoring in Economics and Political Science, whose professors he describes, to Arabic Studies. He offers detailed sketches of the faculty in that department, especially Essaid Badawi, and discusses the Teaching Arabic as a Foreign Language program (origins, curriculum, graduates, etc.) from which Bonnah earned a Master’s degree in 1981. He speaks of joining the Arabic Language Institute as a faculty member, and of teaching for the Center for Arabic Study Abroad, which he describes, and his eventual departure from AUC and Egypt (outside of recurring returns to teach the CASA summer program). He relates the impact of the political protests of the summer of 2013 on the CASA program, and relates his experience of an Islamist pro-President Morsi demonstration. Bonnah also sketches out his career in the United States at Middlebury College and Georgetown University, and more generally his life in America and enduring connections with Egypt.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
