Beg ins, This traffic should come to Bahrain for the following reasons. (a) Wharf area at Has Tanura nil apart from small oil Company^ pier. Company possesses only crane available,, R^ad from landing point at and of headland unfit for heavy traffic* (b) consequently greater part of cargoes shipped to Has Tanura would have to be transhipped by dhow to other small ports and Saudi inefficiency would cause un-ending delay in over side delivery involving loss of time tostearners, (Note* For similar reasons most (2 corrupt groups) imports other ^than) Oil Company materials still go via Bahrein instead of Ran Tanura in spite of re-export duty); (c). Judging by the example of Gray Mackenzie negotiations Saudis would impede Agents work at every turn; (d) On the other hand Bahrain can handle 500 to 600 tons daily additional re-export cargo on Customs Plan apart from (? over) side deliveries. Efficient handling ex-steamers at Bahrain would facilitate rapid dhow transport to 0pair Qstif Jubail^ and Manifa thus preventing congestion and facilitating onward transport; (e) we should not encourage development of Ras Tanura as general port in war-time, since this involves eventual loss of entire Bahrain transit trade. 3, In my view Bahrain should offer transit facilities for Saudi trade at one per cent to cover costs. I should expect Sheikh to agree. This should (? apply to) all Saudi trade whether existing or additional. 4.

Then the negotiations got into the hands of the Council of . iniwterBf where men like Shaikh Yusuf Yaaln» who mow nothing about shipping, had an opportunity to produce bright ideas from first principles. Finally, fr# villa had to face not only the usual methods of oriental bargaining, where he was constantly aasnred that the last terms had bean presented and fresh ones were produced a day or two later, but aleo the difficulty peculiar to this country, where the raore-or- less responsible Baudl officials are sofnetirses absent from Jedds and thus out of reach of direct argument for weeks at a time. 3. Knowing what a sore subject this has been with Ibn Smid, and that in the peat we have always declared that whether British steamers should call at &amp;audl ports on the Gulf was a commercial matter over which His Majesty*s Govern ment had no control, X was careful not to push tha claims of Messrs.

During the negotiation© it wae .earned thet the baud! Government were levying port due® on the German ©hip© (Hanea line) which were bringing material tor G#£.S.O.G# to Has Tanura. Thi© was disturbing not only to G.A.9«0#0«# whose oonoeesion expressly exempts them frewa payment of such / due©#dues* but also to Mr* V ills* since no port dues are levied at Banraln* or at any other port in the Gulf# whether Arab or leralan* and the levying of dues at fae Temira would create a dungerotut precedent, rhe port of Basra* where dues are levied* cannot be quoted the other way, for# even if it can be considered as on the Gulf* It Is a proper port and not an open roadstead and the dues levied are for services rendered. lr. frills urged that the mail eteamer© should In any case be exe mpt* since they will have to call whether they have cargo for Has Tanura or not. The Saudi Govenvaent have not agreed, and the last word was recorded in Mr. villa's final letter of reserves, in which he hinted that if dues were charged the British India would have to charge hi^ier rates of freight for Mss Tenure than for Bahrain. It Is hoped that this argument will be effective. ?• Messrs* Gray*Mackensie possess a fleet of bargee and tugs which they have begun to use for trans-shipping cargo from the etearjere at Mas Tanurs to el Khubsr, the port of the oil field. Seeing the advantage of this arrangement# the Baud!

Mr. wills agreed# on condition that his Company should be permitted to have representatives at such places to land the cargo and deliver it to the consignees. This proposal was not accepted* partly because the Saudi Government imagined their coast studded with European shipping agents# but mainly because they know nothing about shipping.

He be! lares that they htve even at times euvisa ed RaoTa ura as an enormous entrepot serving as a port of transit for Bahrain and thus reversing the present osition so falling to Ibn 3a ud; ^hereoa in his opinion there is j o need to have wharves and warehouses at Raa Tenura or indeed to land cargo there at alls it con beat be used, he maintains, s &amp; deep-water anchorage where tankers can take oil i rorn the Hasa oil-field, and cargo for daudi Arabia can be transhipped into barges for despatch under tow to Al Khubar and elsewhere, for the oil field, and to Ucxair, for I ofuf and Riyadh* It is interesting in this connection to q ote Fuad Bey Hams a, who returned fron Irr r , via. uv/ai t, while I was at Riyadh* He spoke of the nearness of uwait to Kiyadh by car, and pointed out that for a person travelling 1 rom Riyadh by c.r, it took no longer to reach Basra, with its airlines connecting with durojK? and the 3ast» than ofuf. This is true, and the traveller at Hcfuf is still a cliffic;^lt day’s journ ?y by car from Has Tanura. It may bo, then, that the Saudi authorities recognise that even if RaB Tanura cm be made into a good port, it Is not very convenient os to situation* 4* Ibn 3aud is luo ortkid about Ira ii t esi ns on Kuwait - another subject which he brought up during my visit* I gave reasons for believin that i uwait would ot easily bo n well owed up by Iraq, but the Clng may think that the position of Kuwait would be s ronger if he had signed the proposed agreement, which would tend to show that 3audi Arabia/Arabia and not Iraq Is the proper hinterland of Kuwait. It is natural that Ibn soud should not want to see his terrltor;/ shut off from Kuwait by the relatively powerful a tat of Iraq. Finally* Ibn 3 mid ms wish to see the personal position of the heikh of Kuwait atrenAthened. Me spoke to me ono day about the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain — hio traditional connection with them* hia personal eytipethy with them as fellow Arab rulers, and his roc «t at recent events which nii ht hi v© dams ;ed their prestige, e* • the riot in Bahrain, w .ich he attributed to Persian machinations, and the appointment in Kuwait of a council coni osed of elements which were not al^, he thought, of the highest quality. He said that he apologised if he was stepping outside hie jurisdiction (I had Indeed mad© some deprecating remarks), but he felt very strongly n the subject. It s or ed to me that the King felt that his ovn position was affected by the recent constitutional change in Kuwait, and thou ht it wae time for Arab rulers to help one another* 5 # whatever the motives behind the j ing*; request for the speedy conclusion of the pronosed Agreement, I hope, as I Slid in the second of the two above-mentioned tele grans, that wc she. seise the opport nity. 7 .

Dear 3ir 'Irenehard, Will you please refer to your deni-official letters To.584-3 and 586-3 of the 11th November 1938 in regard to the port at l&lt;as Tanurah and the probable loss to the Bahrain Government of transit dues ? 2. In the first place it is not quite correct to say that !Iesers. Dray, Mackenzie have established themselves in nas Tanurah. I emission has been given for representatives including 3mith, to visit Has Tanurah and it is true that a site has been ear-marked for them. 3ut their actual estaolish- ment as a company there still awaits the formal sanction of the bauai Government, and 1 uxiderstaiid that dlls (whom 1 believe you know) is at present in J edda negotiating this. 3. Once the port is established at Has Tanurah and steamers begin to call there, Bahrain will of course lose the major part of its transit dues on trade with oaudi -Arabia. This is acknowledged here, and the only satisfaction to be derived is that the Bahrain Government have taken exceptionally large sums in transit dues in the last year or two on machinery for the Jalifornia Arabian standard Oil Gorapany. de Grenier tells me that ordinary transit trade for aaudi -Arabia, excluding the r il Jompany's stuff, brings in an average of about Rs 20,GC0 to Ks 25,000 a. year, and we agree that at least 80 per cent of this will go when ^as Xanurah is fully esta oil shed. it is almost certain tha t/ The Hon’ble Jir Trenchard j’owle^.G.

No doubt there are a good many Saudi interests who are trying to scrounge a penny or two out of C.A.S.O.O., so the firm must walk warilyi and even if C.A.S.O.C. themselves were to ask for the services of the British firm I doubt whether such a request would turn the scale. The only thing to do is to try to get through the smoke screen of hungry Arab contractors and explain matters to the King. I trust that Wills’s enquiries via the Minister in London have enabled him to do this. You will have seen that the Saudi Arabian Govern- o ment returned a civil answer to my note about the services of the Royal Indian Navy in buoying the channel to Has Tanura, so I feel sure the King is grateful about our help in this matter: one of his great sorrows at the time of the Hendel visit was not having an outlet on the Gulf, so I trust he feels we have helped him a bit towards the removal of %heX particular grouse.

SAUDI ARABIA. 1?* It is reported that the Bahrain boats and launches which went to A1 Khobar for the purpose of taking stores, sand etc. for the use of the oil company there have been turned back by the Saudi authorities who say that they do not want foreigners to do that sort of work in their territory. The Saudi authorities took similar steps two years ago. As there are insufficient Saadi boats for the work in progress the oil company is in some difficulty, but it is hoped that an arrangement will be reached shortly. Meanwhile, intense activity continues at Damman and rapid developments of the oil field there is to be expected. (P.A. Bahrain)My dear .Ian, 2 enclose copies of some correspondence between Allard and a Mr. Ills, of Gray, Mackenzie and Qonpany, and between Bollard and myself, which is, as Bullard says at the ©tart of hi© first letter to ne, self-explanatory. 3. - ills came to see ae a day or two ago and confirmed generally what he had written to Bollard, dasoc had hitherto imported all their machinery, etc. for their work in Mass through Bahrein, paying the Bahrein Government a doty of - for the privilege. They had not minded that moch, because the amount of machinery Involved was email, how, however, that oil had been struck and they were going to develop an oil field which they expected would soon be producing far more/ A.C. Trott, Esq. J eddamore than Bahrein, they would need far larger imports and did not see their way to go on paying the duty. Hence the move to Has T mu rah* 3 . Casoc do not, how ewer, want to have to rely upon a liaudi firm either for unloading their material or checking end ^seeing it once it is unloaded* They particularly want aray, 1 ackenzle to do this for them - at least so fills says - and 1 cross-examined him on the point, according to him, their keenness owereaiae their reluctance to intervene in administration questions, with the result that the icmdon office telegraphed to Jedda supporting strongly the firm’s application. This had led to the ha If-concession already made by the null Government, which is that Gray, ackenzi© may do the lighterage of the goods and stores from the steamers lying off Has Tanurah to the shore, hut that the crews of their lighters may not land* 4* This, so ills said, was a possible* although highly Inconvenient, arrangement so far as the labour side of the question was concerned* But it did not solve the problem of checking and passing the goods on shore* There was no such thing as a trained ^audi- nrablan/Arabian tally d«*k # eren If the fira were willing to be represented exclusively by *iaudi Arabians* £’or a start at least it was essential that a European manager and a Bahrein assistant should be allowed to live at the port* They were quite willing to pay the fcaudi Government the stme r 'fine 11 of 10 * so they paid the Bahrein Oovcrmsent on the business which they handled. 6 . wills said he fully realised the natural reluctance of tho Osudl Arabian authorities to complicate matters for themselves by allowing stray uropeans to live in places where their presence was not absolutely essential, lie did not aak for representations or enquiries at this stage* assuming the foreign office were willing to make them* as he found that in these affairs it usually paid to take the line that the firm was working in the *&amp;o&lt;ii nrabi&amp;n interest* wished to conform in every way to the require®ante of the ^ae&amp;i Arabian authorities, and to take things up direct with the authorities as a &gt;audi firm would. The difficulty, however, wa« how to get at these authorities* It wee useless trying to do anything on the Has© Coast and it was no use, according to iir deader Bullard, sending anyone to Jedda 6 . In/-6 # In the circui»Bt&amp;ncee f he thought (ainc* I had told him that there were no Minlatere in the unite of the two i^aire) that it would he well for him to go to aec the amdX .^ahian ilnister in i^mdon, tacitly assuming that the restriction on landing applied only to lighter crewa, and esg for advice ae to how his manager and assistant should proceed with regard to ▼lsas» local registration* etc* This would at least lead to id enquiry from the Minister* (i»e* from another quarter)* reaching the baud! Oovemaent, and probably the King himself* ?• I told ills that in view of the difficulty of getting at the Jaudls anyhow else* this seemed as good a course as any other* and he departed saying he would let me know how he got on* Yours ewer* (Sd.)

Campbell, the head of Gray Mackenzie (Shipping Agents) in Bahrain, came to see me today and told me that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company had asked his firm to take on the handling of shipping, freighterage, etc- Eas etera, when their port gets going at/Tanura. Gray Macken zie naturally are quite anxious to do this, and indeed they are the only firm in the Gulf that could handle it at pre sent. The Oil Company, through their Jedda representative, have been trying to induce the Saudi Government to agree to Gray Mackenzie operating at Has Tanura, but the Saudis, pursuing their usual policy of hostility towards anything describable as ’’British interests” in Hasa, have hitherto refused to grant permission. They even went so far as to say that the A1 Qosaibis and A1 Ajajis should operate the agency/ H. T. Peel, Esquire, RESt. P0t. DBPt. India Office, 23 AU31S38 .Whitehall, 3.W. 1 * f O'-'agency at Ras Tanura, though neither of them has the faint est knowledge of the work. In fact A1 Ajaji approached Campbell of Gray Mackenzie with the ingenuous request that Gray Mackenzie should provide him with everything from clerks to winchmen, and all the craft necessary. 3. Gray Mackenzie are sending one of their men named G.W.R. Smith, who used to be in Bahrain, to Jedda to attempt to come to some arrangement with the Saudi Government. And today Campbell had a letter from A1 Khobar indicating that there is at last some hope of a change in the Saudi atti tude. 4. I gather that all the shipping companies working in the Gulf have agreed to appoint Gray Mackenzie as their agents in Ras Tanura, and the British India Steam naviga tion Company are ready to make a trial trip there as soon as the channel has been buoyed. 5. Meanwhile equipment is pouring in here for Hasa and is being shipped across in Gray Mackenzie’s barges to A1 Khobar. The Oil Company has to manage its own unloading there with Saudi labour and can only cope with one barge daily, so it seems that fairly soon there is likely to be a bad blockage. This, I think, is illustrative of one of the main difficulties the California Arabian Standard/-Standard Oil Company are likely to experience in deve loping oil in a big way in Kasa. There may be any amount of oil there, but the Company will find it dif ficult to exploit owing to the Government* s ban on foreign labour, Saudi labour is short in quantity, ex tremely poor in quality and very difficult to control. The Americans try to convince themselves that they get on very well with it but the fact remains that they are generally behind their progamme. 6.

A meeting was held on 17th Novemher in the Hydro^rapher* s room to discuss the possibility of an Admiralty survey of the coast of Arabia, with a view to discovering whether a deep water harbour could be constructed at Ras Tanurah* The following were present (Hydrographer) Rear Admiral J.A.

Ballantyii Oil Company, T.Abicicher stated that he wished to discover whether the Admiralty would be willing to survey the area concerned in order to find whether a deep water channel existed to any possible site lor a port on the mainland, e.g* Ras Tanurah. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company were at present taking preliminary soundings of a rough and ready nature but it was explained that the prospects of there being a useful channel could only be ascertained by a thorough survey with proper equipment. This the Admiralty could not undertake at present; but it was suggested that if the California Arabian Standard Oil Company could procure the equipment it might be possible to obtain the services of a retired naval officer who was a hydrographic surveyor for the work. The Company were anxious that any charts that/that they compiled might he acceptable for general use by all shipping that used the port they hoped to develop* The Hydrographer stated that charts compiled under such conditions would be so used* It was agreed that the future actions of the Company would be dictated mainly by economic motives* If the cost of developing their private port proved prohibitive, they would then consider the possibility of building a submarine pipeline to Bahrein* The cost, however, could only be determined after a detailed survey* It was agreed that nothing further could be done until the details of the preliminary survey work already carried out by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company engineers were known* The representative of the Company indicated that there is nothing in the concession to compel them to establish a port on the Hesa coast; but they made it clear that Bin Baud is pressing the Company to this end. Their main object seems, however to be economic, i*e* to save excessive handling charges for plant and oil. The Hydrographer agreed to examine the original surveys already completed, with a view of determining the amount of work which would be necessary before a safe channel could be properly defined.\r \ \ t GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

We still feel that situation should be closely watched and that if there are any signs of intention to develop Rae Tanura, question of abolishing duties should be raised by Political Agent with Sheikh before Ibn Sand commits himself too far to retreat. This policy seems to us greatly to be preferred to that recommended by the Resident in last sentence of his telegram 179, February 7th. 4. We agree that for reasons stated in paragraph No. 3 of your telegram 491, it is essential that the Political Agent should be associated with the conference.M.04737/36. 6 th November, 1936. % dear Clauson, In reply to your letter P.Z.6942/36, of October 1st, concerning 1 the enquiry of the Bahrein Petroleum Company whether the Admiralty might be willing to survey part of the coast of the Persian Oulf north of Bahrein, we should like to offer the following observations. It is certainly undesirable that an oil port should be developed in Saudi-Arabian territory at Has Tanurah; we have always honed that any oil found in the Rasa concession would be pined to Bahrein for refining and shipment, so that Bahrein would become the central oil port for oil found anywhere on the Arabian coast. Consequently it seems advisable to do all that we reasonably can to discourage the Comnany from developing Ras Tanurah. On the other hand, as you point out, we do not want surveying in this part of the world to be undertaken by any other government. It is known, however, that both the U.S. Coast and Geodetic survey and the Hydrographic Office are engaged on very full programmes of work, and since their nearest surveying shin is in the Philippine Islands it is unlikely that they would detail a vessel to undertake this work. The commitments for surveying of our own hydrographic Denartment are such that it would be M.J. Clauson, Esq., diffici FROM SECRETARY, POLIT1CA COPY SENT CY/AIR MAM. SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFKEdifficult to justify any departure from the d rogramme already mapped out and approved by the Board, and although the area here discussed is in close proximity to one which will be surveyed in the near future to meet Naval Staff requirements, there is little prospect that a ship v/ill be available to extend the work so as to include Ras Tanurah and the coast to the northward. So far as Ras Tanurah is concerned, the survey of 1922 shows a least depth of 19 feet in the entrance; spring tides rise about 6 feet, and the bottom is probably sand overlying dead coral; a considerable amount of dredging would be necessary before the harbour could be made use of by heavy draught vessels, but it is difficult to stress the lack of prospect of a deep water port at this place because it has distinct possibilities. It would of course be possible for the California- Arabian Standard Oil Company to charter a suitable vessel and carry out their own surveying work, but this would be a costly undertaking though possibly not so expensive as would be the case if they had to pay for the work to be done by one of our own ships. This we estimate at about £20,000; and we should certainly feel that we were justified in charging the Company for any work of this nature which we do for them and which is not definitely required by the Navy.

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l 1st October, 1956 My dear Seal, Ballantyne, of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, called on me the other day with a view to discovering whether the Admiralty might be disposed to entertain favourably a suggestion that they should survey part of the Persian Gulf off the Arabian coast North of Bahrein. He brought the enclosed map to illustrate what he wanted. He referred to the fact that when he was away recently, Hamilton, of the Standard Oil, had come to see me about this question ana. that 1 had sent him on to the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty. I remember Hamilton did mention the matter and that I did suggest he should go on to the Admiralty; but I was under the impression at the time that what he was going to speak about was the navigation of the waters actually adjoining Bahrein (i.e. a matter affecting the Bahrein Petroleum Company). it appears that what he really had in mind, and what he discussed with your Hydrographic Department, was /2. was the surveying of the waters off the Saudi Arabian coast (for the purposes of the California Arabian Company), with a view to the shipment of oil from some point such as Has Tanurah. As you will see from the enclosed map, which 1 understand was given to Hamilton by the Admiralty and is based on Admiralty Charts, the California Arabian Company are considering making arrangements for shipping the oil extracted in their Hasa Concession direct by tanker from one of several points on the Coast. This is obviously likely to develop the port at Has Tanurah, which will no doubt prove to be the most convenient shipping place, and I asked Ballantyne whether it would not be more convenient for the California Arabian Company to pipe their oil to Bahrein (they are, of course, already proposing to pipe crude oil across to the Bahrein Refinery for refining), and ship it from Bahrein with the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s oil. ^e said that he did not think this was feasible since, if, as he imagined, there were good deep water channels up to the Arabian coast, it would obviously be the most economical arrangement to bring tankers in there. Moreover, they had the king’s obvious wishes to bear in mind. Also, it would suit the Company to be able to take their stores, plant, etc., direct to the Arabian coast without passing through/through Bahrein if they could. The immediate point on which Ballantyne wanted our advice was whether, if he went along' to the Admiralty, they would be likely to entertain favourably a suggestion that a survey should be ma.de of certain selected areas off the Arabian coast at the Company’s expense. He gathered from Hamilton's report of his conversation with the Hydrographic Department that there should be no difficulty about this. Obviously we do not want to do anything to encourage the development of a Saudi Arabian port. On the other hand presumably, if the Admiralty refused to do the work, the Company would be quire able to get some other surveying vessel to go and do it. If the work is to bo done at all perhaps it is preferable that it should be done by His Majesty’s Government. Subject to any observations which Rendel (to whom I am sending a copy of this letter) may have to offer, 1 would propose to tell Ballantyne, if you agree, that he can go and see the Hydrographic Department and that they will give him such assistance in the matter as the surveying programme in the Gulf permits. Presumably Ibn Saud’s formal approval would have to be obtained for any surveying/surveying within territorial waters if such required. Yours sincerely* iSgti.)

The British Government did not want to encourage the development of a Saudi Arabian port (folio 73), because of the adverse economic impact it would have on Bahrain (folio 63).The papers include: a request from the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC) for an Admiralty survey of the coast of Arabia, including minutes of a meeting between the Admiralty, the India Office, and the Company (folios 52-59); the conclusion of an agreement between the Government of Saudi Arabia and Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company Limited to act as landing agents at Ras Tanurah, including correspondence from Sir Reader William Bullard, HM Minister, Jeddah; and consideration by the Government of India in 1940 whether trade with Saudi Arabia should be diverted to Ras Tanurah, with comments by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.The main date range of the papers is 1936-40; there is only one item of correspondence dated 1945.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
