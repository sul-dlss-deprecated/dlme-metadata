Letter of Admiralty to India Office, let October 1908. Pol. 3881/08. 1. The question of the Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gulf is part of the 1 iarger question of British policy in the Gulf an 1 neighbourhood, which is outside the scope of iie present Memo randum. It is enough to remark that the advance of the Bagdad Railway and the activity of Turkey in the waters of the Shatt-al-Arab have r^vntly brought the lighting and buoyage question into greater prominence. For some /&gt;0 years the buoyage of the Gulf has been maintained by British enterprise, namely that of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and now that it seems likely that railway communication will be opened with the Persian Gulf via Asia Minor, it is urged with some force that Great Britain, the predominant maritime Power, should in the interests of British and Indian trade endeavour to improve communication with the head of the Gulf by sea. There are many references in our papers to the difficulties of navi gation in the Gulf, especially by night, owing to incomplete surveys and defective lighting and buoyage. 2. The question of lighting and buoyage first came up in a practical form when a proposal was made by the Hamburg-American Company, in the early part of 1907, that they should contribute to the upkeep of the navigation buoys maintained in the Gulf by the British India Steam Navigation Company. It w T as believed that a political motive lay behind the proposal, and the suggestion was therefore made that the British Government should itself take over the buoys from the British India Company. An Inter-Departmental Conference^ held at the Admiralty on the 17th July 1908, recommended in their Report, dated the 19th September 1908, that this action should be taken, and, further, that lights and buoys should be provided on an extended scale at Mu&amp;cat and s. 126. avarious places in the Persian Gull. Meanwhile, the Government of India had independently re commended the holding of a local enquiry with the same object, and their proposal received the approval of a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, from whose Report, dated the 26th January 1909, the following is an extract ' 4. Lighthouses and Buoyage. ' While it is desirable that, if the British ' shipowning Companies press for additional ' navigational lights in the Gulf, all reasonable ' steps should be taken to meet their wishes, yet, in ' view of the limited volume of the trade at present, ' the Committee do not recommend that any ' considerable expenditure that could not be ' recouped by light dues should be incurred -under ' this head. But they are of opinion that it would ' be worth while to incur the expenditure involved ' in the proposal now under consideration, to send ' a Commission to collect information, consisting ' of the Senior Naval Officer, the officer in charge ' of the Indian Marine Survey, and an expert to be ' obtained through the Trinity House. This ' Commission would also deal with the question of ' buoyage. This proposal has the support of the ' Inter-Departmental Committee (Foreign Office, ' India Office, and Admiralty). The cost will be ' that of the expert and incidental expenses; ' the other two officers receiving no extra pay.' The Treasury afterwards agreed to accept as a charge against British revenues a moiety of the cost of the enquiry. (A sum of 358L 14s. Id. is now r being claimed from them on this account.) 3. The Committee^' presented their Report on the 29th April 1909, and a summary of the. lights and buoys proposed by them is printed as Appendix I. Briefly, the3 T recommended (para graph 7 of Report) the establishment in the Gulf of 13 lights! i 11 (i n addition to buoys), and of these seven were named as those most urgently required, viz., in order of importance,-— (1.) Shatt-al-Arab Bar, light vessel and four buoys. (2.) Musandam (Little Quoin). (3.) Muscat. (4.) Bushire. (5.) Shaikh Shuaib. (6.) Ras-al-Mutaf. (7.) Tanb. (8.) Kubbar Island (Koweit). (9.) Ras-al-Arz (Koweit). (10.) Bahrein. (11.) Lingah. (12.) Debai. (13.) Bunder Abbas. The Committee further recommended (para graph 12) the provision of a lighthouse tender, and (paragraph 15) of a depot at Koweit.

Hood, the expert in lighthouse construction, whose services on the Committee had been obtained from the Trinity House. The Summary with which his Report concluded is printed as Appendix II., and, in view of subsequent correspondence, it is useful to note the cost of two items in particular, viz., 30,0001. initial, and 5,000L annual recurring, for a new lighthouse tender, and 22,0 ( )0l. initial, for a depot at Koweit. The general financial effect of his estimates is apparent in the following extract from a letter addressed by the India Office to the Admiralty on the 1st September in reply to one of the 7th August in which the Admiralty had commented on the Committee's own Report:— ' It will be seen that, apart from any expendi ture on the purchase of land for lighthouses or for other works, the cost of the entire scheme proposed by the Committee, including the pro vision of a lighthouse tender, is estimated by Mr. Hood at 158,I50L initial, and 10,7451. annual recurring expenditure; or, if certain savings are effected by the conversion of a Royal Indian Marine vessel into a lighthouse tender and by modifications in the system of lighting, at 107,500/. initial, and ( J,280L annual recurring expenditure. The cost of an alternative scheme on a smaller scale, to include provision of the lights recommended in paragraph 7 of the Com mittee's Report as those most urgently required, is estimated at 120,550Z. initial, and 8,7201. annual recurring expenditure—or, if savings of the kind mentioned above are effected, at 92,3001. initial and 8,515L annual recurring expenditure. ' The expenditure involved in the Committee's recommendations, even when limited to the smaller scheme, is very considerable. It was clearly laid down by Lord Morley, in the letter to the Foreign Office of the 22nd December 1908, proposing the appointment of the Committee, that the question of giving effect to its recommenda tions must be governed by financial considera tions, and the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, in their letter to the Foreign Office of the 27th January 1909, were unable to hold out any prospect of a contribution from the British Exchequer towards the cost of any lights. In these circumstances, and in view of the necessity for rigid economy in Indian finance. Lord Morley is not prepared to consider at present the question of giving effect to the Committee's recommenda tions. He proposes, subject to any observations the Lords Commissioners may have to offer, to inform the Government of India accordingly.' A copy of the letter addressed to the Admiralty was forwarded to the Foreign Office with a request for their observations.4 5. In reply, the Foreign Office concurred in the view that it was impossible at the moment to carry into effect the full scheme recommended by the Committee, but they urged as a first step the taking over of the buoys of the British India Company. The Admiralty also agreed, and, after some further correspondence, the assent of the Treasury was obtained to the equal division between British and Indian revenues of the estimated expenditure involved in this proposal, viz., l,()00L initial as payment to the Company, and 135Z. Gs. Sd. annual recurring, in respect of future maintenance. The deed of assignment that was ultimately executed on the 9th February 1911 provided for the transfer to Government of the full number of 15 buoys and one beacon (at Bahrein) that had belonged to the Company, on the understanding that a portion of HUm 1,000Z. should be'refunded later, in view y^^r'oi the fact that certain buoys had been reported m ^ ss i n S ^e time when the deed was executed. ~ ' I It was arranged that for the future the buoys should be maintained by the Royal Indian Marine, who were also to be responsible for replacing the missing buoys except one—the ' Lawrence ' buoy—that was no longer required owing to the shifting of tlie Shatt-al-Arab channel.

During the time when the transfer of these buoys to Government was being arranged, reports were furnished by His Majesty's Consul of meetings held at Basrah on the 21st and 28th June 1910, at which the local German community had supported projects for the lighting and buoyage of the Shatt-al-Arab by Turkish agency. Further, the Turkish Com modore stated that he would ask his Government to undertake the lighting of Fao and the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab without any charge on shipping. At the instance of Colonel Cox, it was decided as a counter-measure to place an acetylene gas buoy on the outer bar, at a cost estimated not to exceed 600L initial, plus 4:01. annual re curring, in respect of maintenance. Of this expenditure the Treasury agreed to defray a moiety as before, the political aspect of the matter being strongly urged on them by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 0 The placing of the buoy was expedited on news being received from Con stantinople that a scheme for buoying and lighting the Shatt-al-Arab had been submitted to the Turkish Minister of Marine. 7. A further development took place a little later when the Commander of the Turkish guard- ship in the Shatt-al-Arab declared that he had categorical instructions to lay down buoys and that the matter had been rendered urgent by the constant complaints of German vessels. Instruc tions were thereupon issued by the Government of India to the Naval Commander-in-Chief that the British buoys should be laid down without regard Activity of Turkey in the Shatt-al- Arab, and laying- down of a British lig-hted buoy.

The activity of the Turkish authorities still continued. Reports were received of their plans lor supplying pilots at the mouth of the Shatt-al- Arab, for a lighthouse at Fao, a light-vessel near the outer bar. and the laying of further buoys. Ihe chart, referred to at the head of this memo randum, which accompanied a letter of the Director of the Royal Indian Marine, dated the 15th May last, shows the situation at last arrived at. According to this information there are now in the Shatt-al-Arab five Turkish buoys and one Turkish light vessel, while the British buoys are seven in number, of which one is the lighted gas buoy referred to in paragraph 6. According to a telegram from the Naval Com mander-in-Chief, dated the 22nd April last, the position of these lights and buoys is as follows ;— — British Buoys. Turkish. Buoys. Light Vessel.

The whole question of the conservancy of the Shatt-al-Arab was thus forced to the front, and in a letter to the Government of India, dated the 24th March last, the Naval Commander-in-Chief reported that the situation was becoming an impossible one: ' The only solution,' he continued, 'would appear to be the formation of an international ^ commission on which Turkey, Persia and Great ' Britain would be represented .... It may '' prove necessary to admit German and Russian representatives on the conservancy, but I am ' strongly of opinion that this would be a lesser evil than to allow the Turks to have the uncon- ' trolled management of the waterway.' It is unnecessary here to follow the course of 'the corre- spondencet that ensued upon the Admiral's sue- s. 126. B 0G gestion. The decision ultimately arrived at by His Majesty's Government is defined in the following extract from a memorandum communicated to the Turkish Ambassador on the 29th July last ::: ' ' Certain difficulties have recently arisen in ' regard to the buoyage of the Shatt-al-Arab. For a great number of years British shipping lias, ' owing to its volume, been predominantly, and until recently ahnosc exclusively, interested in these aids to navigation. For over fifty years the work of surveying, buoying, and lighting the river has been carried out by British agency to ' the general satisfaction of all concerned. ' In these circumstances, Jlis Majesty's Govern ment have some difficulty in appreciating why the Ottoman Government have taken exception to existing and long-standing arrangements; but, being desirous of dealing with the difficulty in a spirit of conciliation, they would propose to the Ottoman Government the appointment of a small ' riverain commission, comprised of a British and a J urkish representative, with an engineer to be '• mutually agreed upon. This commission would superintend all matters pertaining to improvement of navigation, and it would likewise superintend ' the requisite periodical surveys. 'As regards the rest of the Persian Gulf, on the ' other hand, the Turkish Government, so far as they are concerned, would recognise the right of ' Great Britain (a) to control surveying, lighting, ' buoying, and pilotage; (6) to police its waters ; ' and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements.' Pol. 3912/11. * This was in accordance with recommendation of a Report b} the the Snb-Committee of Imperial Defence, dated the 14th July 1911. 10. It is proposed now to describe in greater detail the projects at present before His Majesty's Government for the lighting and buovao'e of the Persian Gulf. In a letter to the Government of India, dated the 25th February 1911,it was strongly urged by the Naval Commander-in-Chief that certain of the lights and buoys that had been recommended bv the Committee of enquiry should be provided with out delay. Correspondence ensued between the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the India Office, with the result that on the 15th September last a letter was addressed to the Fbreign Office requesting that the Treasury might be moved to accept as a chaige against British revenues a moietv of expen diture, estimated according the most accurate data obtainable at— £ 47,600 2,490 Initial Annual recurrine: for the provision of— (1) An acetylene gas buoy and one licht-vessel in the Shatt-al-Arab ; (2) Lighthouses at Musandam (Little Quoin), Tanb Island, and Shaikh Shuaib Island ; and (3) A light vessel for Bushire.

Particulars oi the expenditure are printed as Appendix 111. Pol. 1599/11.

In a letter dated the 28th October 1911, the Treasury drew attention to certain points in con nection with the scheme, but expressed their readiness to bear a moiety of the charges connected with the provision of the acetylene gas buoy in the Shatt-al-Arab, and of the lighthouses at Musandam, Tanb Island, and Sheikh Shuaib Island. They questioned, on the other hand, the necessity of the light-vessel 0 proposed for the Shatt-al-Arab, and urged the substitution of a light-buoyf for a light- vessel'^ at Bushire, in view of certain observations made in Admiral Slade s letters to the Admiralty and the Government of India, dated the 11th May and 6th August respectively, which seemed to indicate that less expensive proposals might suffice. Correspondence is still proceeding with the Government of India as regards the suggestions made by the Treasury, also as to the provision and cost of ttie lighthouse tender. Another item of expenditure that must apparently also be provided for is that of the depot which the Committee recommended should be located at Koweit for gas-works, the storage of buoys, &amp;c. In Mr. Hood's estimates a capital sum of 22,0001. was entered on this account, but presumably the expenditure will be considerably less in view of the more restricted character of the lighting and buoyage proposals now under consideration. In any case no allowance need be made m respect of the maintenance of the depot, since charges on this account are included in the estimates given in Mr. Hood's Report of the cost of the several lights. 127 Assuming, for the sake of completeness, that the lights and buoys recommended in the letters of the India Office of the I5th September and I8th November 1911 (see paragraph 10 above) were all provided (without the adoption of the Treasury suggestions), that a lighthouse tender were procured at a cost of 30,000Z. initial, and 5,0001. annual re curring, and that a depot were equipped at the full8 capital cost of 2'2,000l., the resulting expenditure would amount to— .£ Initial - 102,400 Annual recurring - - 7,700 It will be noted that a large proportion of this expenditure, both initial and annual, is represented by the cost of the lighthouse tender. 13. At this point mention may be made of two projects which though not directly connected with the subject of this Memorandum may yet entail considerable expenditure of a somewhat similar kind. In the first place, it is proposed to carry out certain surveys in the Persian Gulf that may entail the employment of a Royal Indian Marine vessel for several years. The Government of India have been asked for information as to the cost and duration of the operations, in order that the Treasury may be approached as to bearing a moiety of the charge. Secondly, the provision of wireless telegraph stations in the Persian Gulf has recently been considered, and, subject to the concurrence of the Foreign Office, the Secretar}^ of State in Council has approved a scheme estimated to cost approximately 19,087Z. initial, and 4,C47/. annual recurring. This expenditure also would be equally divisible between British and Indian Revenues. Two connected questions(1) Sur veys; (2) Wireless Telegraph Instal lations. Telegram to Viceroy, 18th November 1911. Pol. 4638/11. Letter of India Office to Foreign Office, 13tli December 1911. P. W. 1911/11. 14. The question whether any part of the expenditure to be incurred in the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf could be recouped by means of the levy of light dues has frequently been raised in our correspondence, but the matter presents great difficulties, and it has been strongly urged that the inception of the lighting and buoy age scheme should not be delayed pending a satisfactory solution.* In a letterf dated the 29th March last, the Foreign Office wrote as follows on this subject:—'The suggested levy could not be &lt;l carried out without the consent of the Powers ' whose flags are flown by the vessels navigating 44 the Gulf, and such consent would not be forth- ' coming except on conditions implying that very ' international control which it is the aim of His ' Majesty's Government to exclude.' The point has again been touched upon in the correspondence between the Treasury and the Foreign Office, and the position will become clearer if ever negotiations on the basis of the British Memorandum to Turkey of the 2 ( Jth July last (paragraph 9 above) are successfully concluded.

It may be useful to explain, in continuation of the printed departmental Memorandum of the 28th December 1911, the present position of the scheme lor the Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gull, adopted as the result of the local enquiry held in 1909. A convenient starting point is the summary of maximum possible expenditure,' described in paragraph 12 of that Memorandum in the following words: ' Assuming, for the sake of ' completeness, that the lights and buoys recom- ' mended in the letters of the India Office of the ' l-'th September and 18th November 1911 {see paragraph 10 above) were all provided (without '' t) 16 adoption oi the Treasury suggestions), that a « tender were procured at a cost of b0,000l. initial, and 5,000/. annual recurring, ' and that a depot were equipped at the full capital cost ol 22,000/., the resulting expenditure would amount to -initial 102,400/., annual ' recurring 7,700/.' -* ' r reasury suggestions above referred to were that a light vessel proposed for the Shatt- el-Arab should be dispensed with, and that a lighted buoy should bo substituted at Bushire for a light- vessel. After some correspondence the Treasury withdrew their objection to the Shatt-al-Arab light- vessel, but, as regards Bushire, it was decided buoy (at the outer anchorage in for the inner anchorage) would be that a lighted addition to that sufficient. In another described in paragraph the elimination of the 9,500/.) that had been important I equipment of the depot (cost 22,000/.) s. 186. respect the scheme was modified, viz., in spare light-vessel (cost included as part of the3.

Total 84,000 7,090 * In abeyance, see paragraph 6. It is in addition to the British lighted buoy already laid in the Shatt-al-Arab (outer bar). See paragraph 6 of earlier Memorandum. Thus the sanctioned scheme includes three light-houses, one light-vessel, six lighted and three unlit buoys. These are in addition to the lighted buoy provided for the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab in 1911 and the unlit buoys taken over from the British India Company.! It was subsequently decided that the cost of two dioptric lanterns for Bush ire (see paragraph 11 below) should be met from savings out of the total figures here given. t Paragraphs 5 and 6 of Memorandum dated the 28th December 1911.

By good fortune it was found possible to The Lighthouses, obtain for the Tanb Island lighthouse tiie plant that had been ordered for a lighthouse for the Colonial Office. The construction of this light house is consequently well in hand. The plant fur the lighthouse at Musandam has been ordered, but will not be ready for several months. As regards the Shaikh Shuaib lighthouse, there has been a hitch, owing to the fact that the conditions attached by the Persian Government to the erection of a lighthouse on their territory are r&lt; , _ w unacceptable His Majesty's Minister at Tehran is Tmvnley, No!

Government once more with a view to the .^rant of a concession—say, a lease for 99 years—which would allow a lighthouse to he built and worked by His Majesty's Government. If it were not for the expense, a good way out of the difficulty would be the substitution of a light-vessel for the proposed lighthouse. The cost of the lighthouse, as stated above, is 8,0001. initial, and 4:001. annual recurring. The corresponding figures for the cost of a light-vessel, according to Trinity House estimates, are 9,500L initial, and f)50Z. annual recurring. (The Indian authorities have, however, stated that they could themselves build a light-vessel for 1,080/. less, i.e., 8,420/., see paragraph 5 below.) 5. ()n the recommendation of the Government of India the light-vessel for the Shatt-al-Arab is being constructed in Bombay Dockyard, where light-vessels have been built for the Bay of Bengal. According to latest information, it is anticipated that a saving of 1,080/. may be effected on the sanctioned estimate (9,500/.) The iron mast, lantern, &amp;c. are to be sent out from home. 6. Five lighted buoys have been sent out (in addition to the lighted buoy provided for the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab in 1911). The sixth, intended for the inner bar of the Shatt-al-Arab, is not lor the present being supplied, in view of the negotiations opened with the Turkish Government for the establishment of a Shatt-al-Arab Navigation Commission. 7. The unlit buoys are, like the light-vessel, being constructed in Bombay Dockyard on the recommendation of the Government of India. Letter of Director of the Royal Indian Marine, 31st August 1912. P. 3707/12. 8. A matter in which no progress has yet been made is that of the lighthouse tender. The Committee that reported after local inquiry in 1909 on the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf regarded it as imperative that a specially constructed steamer should be provided to act as a lighthouse tender, and Mr. 1). W. Hood, the expert member of the Committee, wrote in his Supplementary Report:—' I estimate her cost, ' delivered in the Persian Gulf, after construction in Kngland, at 30,000/. The Indian Government ;; from their own experience will be able to estimate what her annual maintenance would be in the Last, but it would probably amount to about 5,000/. per annum, inclusive of wages, repairs, ' coal, stores, and all charges.' These figures—initial expenditure 30,000/., and annual recurring 5,000/.—represent the maximum estimate sanctioned by the Secretary of State in Council and the 1 reasury, but the plans received from India are for a larger vessel than that contem plated, and one that woidd cost very much more to maintain. Ihe matter is still under consideration.n 9. It was first proposed to locate the lighthouse depot at Koweit, but this plan was abandoned in favour of a site on the land leased by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on the island of Abadan, near Mohammerah. Details are about to be investigated locally, but the conditions contemplated are, briefly, that land up to a total of two acres should be rented at U. an acre for 49 years from the 29tl) May 1912, the period of the Company's own lease, and that the Company shoidd carry out certain works recommended by the Trinity House,supply oil (if in accordance with specification), and erect the necessary oil tanks. It is hoped that the result of the local investi gation will enable work at the depot to proceed without delay. An appreciable saving should apparently be effected on the cost of the depot, as originally estimated, through the employment of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's agency. 10. In accordance with the recommendation of Trinity House, certain stores for the depot are being- sent out from Kngland, viz :— 2 spare lighted buoys. 2 spare lanterns. 3 sets of spare buoy moorings. It is also in contemplation to send out a crane. 11. Mention may here be made of the supply of two dioptric lanterns for the Residency at Bnshire at an estimated cost of approximately 12M. initial expenditure, plus 2| per cent, for Trinity House charges, and 24:1. annual recurring. The Treasury took exception to the supply of these lanterns outside the sanctioned programme, and explanations were furnished by this Office. 12. In a letter to the Foreign Department, dated the 11th August 1912, Sir P. Cox has called attention to ' the regrettable consequences, both ' political and economic, that might result from the ' failure of any light, even temporarily,' and, with a view to placing future administrative arrange ments on a satisfactory footing, has suggested that for the present the Political Resident should be the chief lighting authority in the Gulf and ex ojjicio ' Inspector of Lights,' and that pending the provision of the lighthouse tender the officer commanding the R.I.M.S. 'Lawrence' should be gazetted ' Assistant Inspector of Lights.' He has also suggested a scale of allowances for officers and men of the 'Lawrence employed in lighting and buoyage work. The views of the Government of India on these proposals have not yet been received. Any extra expenditure on this head may perhaps be met out of savings effected on other parts of the scheme. J. E.
