The Central Gowernarnt have so far shown a most uae one History attitude to the Aakrrhaijan rebels; thii rebels themselves are in urgent need of financial assistance; the tr^de of the province is at a standstill for lack of an outlet and the very existence of the Autonomous Government depends entirely on the supprt of a foreign a nay. Thus, while it would be rash to assume thut some kind of bargain may not y&lt;at be driven vith Tehran, at the moment Autonomous Aserbal an feels much moiv like a part of Russia than of Iran* Indeed, present inuicationa are that Iron’s only hope of retaining Azerbaijan Is ttuit the Russians ar* alter bigger garnet the tail of the donkey lu a most u. iul ins .rurgent of persuasion up to the moment wnen it is twisted off.

It Is possible to give only brief outline of the insurrection which enabled the National Government to ssduiae control* As described in the last &gt;iary, the Persian gendarmerie and military forces in the districts of S^rab ..hi; hianeh were attacked first* % November 3Cth* Mianeh was completely in the hande of the Demo crate and the ;endarmeri© had beei driven fro.D every o/ie of their posts between that town end. Tabriz* Bands of Democrat riflemen, the majority of them Muhajird, controlled the main road and prevented any movement of Persian array personnel or of civilians not authorised to travel by the National Gommlttee* Daragch, tc the South of Tabriz, had bt^n controlled by the Democrats since the end of August, slid by November lVth» or 18th all the villages between Marageh and Tabriz had been cleared of Gendarmes* The main force of Democrats cammed in the villi.\£« of Khoeh /uair between M a rageh ond ^ianduab and began to invest the email * ersi n military garrison at the latter r&gt;laoe. . oBt of the members of this Southern Amey were local peasants* They had commandeered the horcea of several wealthy landlowners and formed a cavalry '’regiment f ’. The region Test of Tabriz was next tackled, and by December let. Maraud, %hol and Dhapur wer^ in Democrat hands* As in the Rest there was little resistince by the gendarmes, but a number of these were killed, either in combat or la revenge for past injuries. At Maraud the District magistrate, the Telegraph Master and several Ifndlords also killed* On&gt;. of the latter was the agent for British publicity literature. The Democrats seemed to have no lack of rifles for their forces - all of them Brno rifles of the type u^ed Oj the Persian imy, and there were a few light automatic we ap onu and p 1 s t oVav a 11 ;i b 1 e also*?ils &gt;♦ Transport o^lon^ing to private contractor® and under contract to the /uiglo-Iranian Oil Company was freely coiaustandeared, and there ^eru a good numbor of kussIsa vehicles (still hearing the United utatssa Army marJcs, having been supplied under Lend-Oease) to he seen currying iIda*is about the country. The Coviat Consul-General f a later explanation of this was th'jt the Uemocrats hud commandeered lorries belonging to the Xrano-Uoviet Transport Company ! If this is so tne hed Army must have been rather car-leas with its soldiers VLnee several were seen uriving truc'x-lJsds Fid a* is about. Th« r«reian Army garrisons at Xabris, Marageh, M.andusb, Ardebil ana Aessleh were thus beleaguered by jecemoer 1st. The Fsrsfen JcKiuaunuant, Sertip burakhshafil, had probably made up his mind that resistance was useless after it became clear that the three battalions of re iniorcements sent from Tehran would not be allowed to pas the *xussians at &amp;a vin. In ny case no g .rrieon, exce t that iiezaieh (eee para 899 below) took any action si t the Democrats. hifleSf pistols and perhaps hand-grenades were distributed to Democrats in the various quarters of Tabriz, and it is a-pare at now that a plan of assault was worked out well beforehand, though it is also probable that an understanding existed between th# Tabriz chiefs of police and Gendarmerie and the national C omit tee. ur ing the few days before tne openini, of the National Parliament the Democrat forces were wrought in from North, South and Bast and concentrated in the villages immediately adjacent to Tabriz. There were numbers of ihih&amp;dira among tnem, but the great majority were Azerbaijani pea* ants, nardy men, but not skilled in weapons of war and without i-uy sort oi uilitiary training. Dn the night of December lith. - l^th* they begsn to move into the town. On the 12th. Sartip Durakhahani withdrew his Headquarters into tue Persian Army barracks on the edge of the town and put hie force into a posture of defence, ^hile the National Parliament was bein^, opened on tlw morning of the iSth. the FidaHs clooed up to all the police stations and the Oenu.rmerie Headquarters in Tabriz and iusuaoned them to surrender. All promptly did so. There was soma rifle lire, chiefly for form**, sake, but no casualties. On December lath, the Democrat forces surrounded the Persian Azw barracks, but made no move towards storming tnem. During the altera n hartip ^urakhsh&amp;ai had a parley with representatives of chv iiatijnal Gavurmaent. He was in \ ireleae o &gt;ia:aui\ i a a t i on with the Minister of War in Tehran and apparently received instructions l&amp;tvr that night to surrender. He signed terns *ith U'aafar x ^siittVari am the surrender cm&amp; izito effect about n p.m. Under tliti articles of capitulation all officers and man were offered the cuoioe between going home and re-enlisting in the People*s Army. Nearly all ah os. to go hO;&amp;e. The t ,srrisona of ^ianauab and Marageh, as far as is known, surrendered shortly afterwards; that at Eezaieh, lifter resistance, on bsceraber 18 th., und that of Ardsbil about the ame tiiae. There is no evidence that any mssian troops «v?r came into action against the Persian garrisons anywhere In the province, but they were behind the Pida’is all th* tLue - both morally «nd physically, am there not the slightest doubt in the Persian GojamandanVs mind that they ^ ulu hsve come into action If tr*e Fida’is had looked likt} iosiug the battle. 2 ^ m of ..the yvutoaomiufl G^ .y_v.rn:uvnt . The National Government hs:^ defined its purpose as to secure local outonoiny for Azerbaijan within the Iranian State, but uy the use of terms such as ^Cabinet' and Prime Ainlater' as well as by the creation of an independent *jp«ea force - the People*s Army - it showt; that it gives n wider interpretation than usual to the phrase ^local aut'):io:^y w .

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I received a visit this morning from Qasim Agha Ilkhani Zadeh, the son of Bayazid Agha, one of the principal chiefs of the Dehboukri tribe of Kurds who live in the neighbourhood of Bukan. ' ®* *asim Agha said he had called to give me an account of his visit to Baku on September 17th., which was reported to you by Mr. /■ Tabri 2 . teleg i' *■*o• 77 of October th. The visit seems to ZJ? h ■ • arrangef^y^fHe ':., . i t uthorities ith rather more mystery- *' u mongering than might have been thought necessary. Qasim Agha said that he was asked to call on the Soviet Town commandant at Mianduab, Bi cute nan,, Kamaz Alioff, and was asked by him if he were prepared to go soin.ethirig the nature of •v.hich could nit at present be revealed. QasiiU, a • no doubt knew what was In the wind, said he was ready, and was then iold to go to Tabriz, taking only one suitcase and there present himself at the Russian Consulate-General. 3. On his arrival at Tabriz, Qasim saw the Soviet Town Commandant who tolo him to be at Tabriz Railway Station at 3 p.m. that night, but did not tell him his destination or the object of the journey. &amp;hen he reached the station he was taken straight to a railway carriage in which he found seven other Kurdish chiefs, including Qazi Mohamad from Mahabad, Hamza Agha of the Mamish tribe, Nuri Beg of tne Begzadehs and two Shikkak chieftains from Western Azerbaijan. He learned then that the destination was Baku. The journey was performed without change of trains, and on arrival at Baku the party of ~i t ,ht were taken straight away by waiting cars to a village outside the city. They were accompanied ay Soviet officers, treated very courteously and lodged and entertained in great comfort. The evening after their arrival they were taken into Baku to a building which ui&amp;sim Agha believes to have been the offices or residence of the President of the Soviet Republic of Az. xbai^an, and there were received by Baghiroff, the President of the Republic, and some forty other Soviet officials and military officera* 4. The theme of Baghiroff*s conversation was Kurdish independence, and according to Qasim Agha, he put the issue plainly and concisely, sjAying, in effects 'If you want independence and are willing to work vdth the Azerbaijan Democratic Party to achieve it, we promise to suopen you; on the other hand, if you do not want independence and are oreparei to do nothing about it you must not look to us for any kind of assistance.'' fne chiefs replied that of course they wanted independenci and were glad to accept Russian support. 5. The K u rdish Party stayed three nights in Baku, but saw the President only once. They were not taken into the city to look round, but were given a general view of it from the Public Garden, which happened to empty of Soviet citizens at the time. On the fourth day they were given seats in a special t;. ain - a more comfortable one tt ar '&gt;hat which had brought them from Tabriz - and wort brought str ight back to Tabriz again. Sir R.'*. Bullard, K.G.B. , K.C.M.G., G.I.B., H.m. Ambassador, Tehran.- 2 - 6. Oasim Agfa’s story of the excursion Xl rather thin, but I do not 4oubt that as an outline it is substantially correct. After telling e this, at! discussed the matter of Kurdish independence with apparent frankness# The Kurds, he said, were convinced that the action of the ’Iraqi Government against Mullah Mustafa and of the Iranian Government against the K u rds of kerivan had been undertaken at British instigaticn. Britain appeared to oe hostile to the idea of Kurdish independence, the Kurds therefore would seek the support of the Russians. He himself, he declared, while desiring independence, or at least uutonoray for his people, was not anxious to receive it at the hands of the Russians. He wished that the British would support the Kurdish claimji, but, he said, ,f The British say tney will not intervene in Iranian affairs, and yet, when we appeal to the Russians you are angry »ith usV He repeated the usual Kurdish grievances against the Persian Governments lack of social services in Kurdistan, lack of administrat ion, the harshness of Iranian officers like General Hushmand Afshar, and the profound mistrust all Kurds feel for the Tehran Government. 7. I replied that I thought the British Government would view a movement for Kurdish independence which relied on the backing of a foreign power more in sorrow than in anger, since it had been our experience that the intervention of fraign states in the internal politics of Persia was a mistake which could only bring more unrest and unhappiness to the people of Persia themselves. I uoted in this connection Ur. Kden’s speech in the House of Commons on August 20th., extracts from which have received publicity in Azerbaijan. I gave it as my personal opinion that the British Government was not hostile to any movement in Iran which aimed at bettering the lot of any of the Iranian people, be they Kurds or anyone else, but that to be ultimately successful any such movement must be Iranian, and its leaders ought to work, as citizens of Iran, for the improvement of conditions all over the countryt it was most unlikely that the splitting off of small sections of Iranian territory would in the end do any good to the inhabitants of those sections. 8. Wasim Agha said he agreed with m f and hinted that he knew perfectly well what would be the fate of a small# w independent” Kurdistan. He would far rather that the Kurds were citizens of a united, strong and free Iran, cut uafortunately the Iranians would ndt accept them as such: they treated them as aliens and rebels, neglected their district, and when they askeu for hospitals, bombed their houses. Ho Kurd was allowed to attain any position of importance in the Government, the civil service and the army. He recognized, however, that the Kurds could achieve no satisfaction from open revolt, and hoped that on nis forthcoming visit to Tehran he would be able to make some of the members of the Iranian Government understand the Kurdish point of view and make tnem see the danger to Iran of neglecting or ill-treating the Kurds. 9. Gaaim Agha naturally did not reveal what had been said at Baku about the ways and means of achieving Kurdish Independence with Russian support. It seems probable however that the general line is, ^ as I suggested in Tah je lz Giary No. 15 (1945), paragraph 191, that the Kurdish movement should be co-ordinated with the activities of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party. Ii this is so, it suggests a more convincing reason for the recent reorganization of the Tudeh Party under a new name than simply tnat the T u deh was generally unpopular. The K u rdiah landowners were always hostile so the Tudeh Party, and it is significant that one of the things most stressed by the new Democratic Party is a peaceful settlement of agrarian disputes fair to peasant and land-lord alike. Qasim Agha confirmed what I had /heardheard froia other sources* that the 'Koaala” oA Society based on Mahabad now calls itself the 'Democratic Komala** (The Kurdish word 'Komala' itself means association or party)» A manifesto has been printed, no doubt on Qasi Mohamad’s new printing press, and is said to be very similar to jEhitfxaiii the manifesto of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party. Qasim Agha said that a number of chiefs were already gathered at Mahabad for the purpose of electing a Provincial Committee. I asked Qaala &amp;gha whether the Kurds would claim a share in the government of the autonomous Azerbaijan which the Democratic Party desire to set up. He replied that they would not. What they wanted was a separate Anjuman (Provincial Council) for the Kurdish district. The two 'Democratic Parties' - the Kurdish and the Azerbaijani - are related but distinct, and their aims, if realised, would split Azerbaijan into at least two autonomous region*♦ They seem to be agreed on this nd willing to work together against the Central Iranian Govern ent. 10. Qasim A&amp;hu is an intelligent and influential member of the largest and most peaceable Kurdish tribe in my district, e.nd I have reported his interview with me at length as indicating the lines on which the more intelligent Kurdish aristocrats are thinking. The brief conclusion seems to be that though they distrust the Russians, they distrust the Persians more* and, having no illusions about what the Persians will do to them when the Russians go, they are not unlikely to support a policy which may aim at keeping the Russians here* 11* X enclose extra copies of this despatch for transmission to the Foreign Office and His Majesty's Ambassador at Moscow should you think fit* I have the honour to be.

Dcwocrjtlc xarty AeUvltltta . the Party’s energies In the period under review have been absorbed chiefly in organizing itself and In programme making. It haa, however, found one opportunity to show its mettle in action and to prove that in minatory eloquence and partisan vituperation it is no unworthy successor of T^deh Iran. Its newspaper '’Azerbaijan” attacked Mehdi Farruka from the moment when his appointment was first announced* On October 9th. it called a meeting, said to have been attended by fifteen hundred representative* citizens of Tabriz, at which a resolution was passed warning the Oentral Government that Farrukh’s arrival in Tabriz would be the signal for battle. The old Tudeh line wa© closely followed* it was not the Party who would make trouble, Farrukh was the trouble monger, coming of set purpose as an agent provocateur to start a riot in peaceable and peace-loving Azerbaijan. Th® specific charge* against Farrukh seem to be that he is of bad character, that his appointment - being a mem ber of tue Majlis - is unconstitutional, and that he has bean granted absolute powers. Th&lt;* tone of the resolution was fiery and, from the speeches of various party members at the time, it might well hsve been supposed that Farrukh’s arrival would have started a civil war hau not these Democrats cried Wolf so often before. viopieu of this resolution were sent to the British, kus, ian, ’Iraqi and 1‘urkiah Goneulates, ani to the Superior of the Catholic Mission as being the unofficial representative of France. Later, in a conversation with th Acting British Consul-General, the Soviet Consul-General laughingly asked* ”*lu&gt;t do they suppose you and I can do about it ? w Xo whtth the only answer seomed to be ”What indeed ?” One phrase in the r solution is interesting in the light of later Party pronouncements * 'There are in Azerbaijan itself people who posi-ese good qualifications and who can manage the affairs of Azerbaij an very well”. Meanwhile, the settlement of the party’s own constitution has proceeded* The final form, it seemt, was settled in the conference which began on October 1 st., and it was published In the newspaper on October i 4 th» The Party is organized on a regional basis with committees, var. ing in size according to the town, in all the provincial places. Tabriz, however, keeps a tight hold, its committee being by far the largest, with 43 members, and reserving the right to vet applications for membership of the provincial committees, and, it is stiid, the sole right to n ami mate members of the Commission for the election of a Provincial Council* This assumption of authority by the small Tabriz clique has aroused some resentment in other towns, particularly Messiah* It is even suested that it is undemocratic. On October 10th. a full and detailed programme of action was published, fr e to the Party’s policy of developing Turk! as a literary language the programme was printed in Turki. Uafortunately, the development of the language is getting a bit ahead of the education of the readers of the newspaper, with the reeult that the drafter alon^ know© what some parts of the pr &gt;gramma mean. But that perhaps has never been found a serious shortcoming in such works. The programme contains fifty articles arranged under the heads of General Political, Moonomlc and Commercial, Agricultural, Educational, Public Health, Cultural, Maclal, Legal and Military. The 'General u’oliticaL' section contains perhaps the kernel of the matter In two articles which ar, ue that tfcu formation of provincial and town oo noils, giving a measure of autonomy to Azerbaijan, is essential for the Independence and integrity of Iran, and that to secure this neceaaary local autonomy the Democratic Party must wield unchallenged authority. The proposals Uiiider the otic r heads are refor -iat rather /thanthan rcVoluti.mary f and much oi what they ur^e would in another country not n«t;d to he ur^ed oy a political party, it would be part of the routine of the competent local authority# hut moat of the proposale have an Azerbaijani colour, anu much emphaaie Is laid on tht mother tongue, local culture, etc. Under the headint;. of the ^Hacial ^uestion^, it is said (Article 82); '’Xhe righta of every race living in the Iranian Kingdom to manage its own internal affairs and to settle its o n destiny must be (secured by means oi provincial and town councils.' ^c.f# para 213 bulow). r Thu party claims that it is quite serious in its preparations to elect a provincial council# The recise function* which this body would exercise have not been made entirely clear, but it le beiiv said for instance that it &gt; ruld elect a ftovernor-Geaeral for Azerbaijan withe out consulting the Central 'dovernment. A candidate for the post has already been suggested in one Giyami, axi ex-Tudeh leader# Ifhlle such [a step vbuld teem to amoua- to secesaion, the Democrats repeat in the I eatte breath that all they want is local autonomy within the Iranian state# (Iran dakhllinda mahalli muichtariyat).

The Democratic Party hat, of course, everything to gain by holding the elections before the Hueaians leave, and the advantages may be mutual# A :apart of the conf rence above mentioned said that the Party had given all schools, government departments and other public institutions one year in which to change their language from Persian to Turk!• This ultimatum is not repeated in the published programme* It is a ^eneroue allowance of time, but at the present rate of progress among the reading and writing public, would nardly be enough# 211# dezalih . The ti . veiling missi m of the Democratic Party (see last Diary, para 198) had to overcome some opposition from the tempor ary Rezaieh committee, which seems to have taken the Tubeh change of neart too seriously. The Kezaieh Democrats jibbed at local autonomy and th^ use of Turk! as the oflicial language, and were apparently only led to agree when the Sovfet Town Commandant had joined his eloquence to F&amp;rihun Ibrahlai 1 *# When delegates for the party conference were being elected the Kuseians 1 nd Ibranimi inaisted bn the incluai n of 5 Armenians against the will of the committee. The unpopular delegation was eecorted to Tabriz by a truck-load of Russian soldiers. Rezaieh representation at the conference was finally: two members of the original committee, five Armenians and three newly elected muslims. 2 l 2 # Rtfyudeh Auras # The Persian Doimaandant in Azerbaijan received news on October 15th. that Mullah Mustafa Barzani had arrived in Azerbaijan with a considerable following, and had been allowed by the Russian uthoritles in western Azerbaijan to ecttle i . a villsge so .ie fifteen kilometres south of Rezaieh. The Commandant gave the numbers of the nullah 9 * followers as two thousand, of whom five hundred were fully armed.

It seems fairly clear, however, that a definite plan of campaign was proposed and accepted, and the main change in the situatidn io that the leaders of the Kurdish independence movement at Jriahabad have now agreed to work with the reconditioned Tudeh f&amp;rty. ?h« main stumoling block before had been tho fcanE-culottiam of the fudeh, for the Kurdish Aghaa are rich men with a sense of their own family pride and aristocratic traditions, as well as a keen appreciation of the value of their Isolds and llouks. I he agrarian campaign of the new democratic Party has been watered down, a pax'ade of non-violence and Justice for b ’th sides haa been made, and, while the grant of Government lands to the peasants is still urged, little is heard now of tne expropriation of the big landowners.

But tiie K u rdB are waiting for the arrival of various influential chiefs from outlying parts. If matters ever do come to an open conflict with the Iranian authorities tte degree of co-operati n between the Democratic Kurds and the Democratic labrizie is hard to predict.

Considering the generally firm belief of Persians in a safety-first policy, the wonder is that in Azerbaijan any voice should be raised against the popular party. Yet, before the Council of Foreign Riniatara in London broke up, about 400 merchants of Tabriz crafted a telegram to it, countering the one sent by the Democratic Party (Last Diary, para 198), and denying that party’s right to speak for Azerbaijan. On© of the wealthiest and foxiest of the Tabriz merchants, who has survived many crises and outlived many parties and more than one occupation, inis been heard to mutter that things have /reachedretched Vac pitca wtore he will bav« to start a party ana a newspaper ot hie own. A similar telegram was sent later by a number of landlords and mullahs. i'here ara rumours, too, that harmony within the Jemocrstic Party itself is not complete. One or two M 01d Liberals' suoh as Aghazadeh, ^ircxig and bhulam hussein Parshi, are; complaiiiing that tha leader, Piahavari, is too subservient to the Russians.

There has been more news of Russian purchases than for some time.

There have been purchases of mutton on the hoof by the Ru&amp;aians from the Bukan and usq.jlz districts. Rot much selling oy the Ru&amp;aiane has been reported lately. One instance of Soviet control of private trade in this province hat come to light in the last fortnightt Hajji Hasten Ahoyilar, a merchant of Tabriz, made a bargain with a French interest in Tehran for the ©ale of ab ut one million tomans worth of Azerbaijan wcnl, but as soon as the Soviet authorities heard Jf it they forbade the despatch on the ^roandt that they themselves needed it. The seller was told to sort the wool and bale it and a Sovfut buyer wruld come and make an offdr for it. It is a method of keeping down prices of oummodities useful to the Russians which has been practised in the past in the case of dried fruits. Merchants still complain th&amp;t it is almost impossible to get a permit for the export of dried fruits through Bazergan. Carpet*, however, seem to be passed without difficulty. The brie v*«t easiness in Tabriz is still being done in carpets ana prices remain high. Taerc seems also to be an increasing demand for shvi'P casings from Tehran for export to America, and prices are rising slightly. Retail prices over the last month show little change. Sugar is down ©lightly after the distribution of ration* for the month* of Mojx.ad &amp;nd Bhahrivar (duly 22nd. - September 2‘ nd.), and the Russian* have had difficulty la finding buyers for 50 tons they have put on the market.

BH i have the honour to abmit the following report of a tour of the liurth Western part of niy Consular District which, as indicated in my Tele,-ram No«62, I have just made. I was accompanied by Mr. yarbudi, the interpreter of this Consulate-General. r^y intention was principally to visit iiaku, which no^British^^ x&amp;t* &lt;4 1JT 2* —^ ___— », --B . Consular Ofticer has seen since the occupation. As there is no nooeu. in Haku and no person vdth British con:x cticns v/hose hospitality I might by custom expect to enjoy, I telegraphed to the Acting Govemor-Gener;il of yes tern Azerbaijan (the Fourth Us tan) on July 31st asking him ii he could arrange accommodation for me in Maku on the night of July 55tn. As I had received no reply from the ustandar by July ^th and +/ obliged by other circumstances to put off my visit, I decided to JP Jry • iglcu the follov/ing v/eeic by way of ezaieh and see what could be arranged from there. Maku was already among the towns specified on ny Marxian pass. 3 . x left Tabriz on the morning of August 4th and reached I.larand, where the road to Khoi and \ estern Azerbaijan branches fro&lt;^i the main Tabriz-Julfa road, at about ha If-past nine. The main Julfa road is in very good condition sand it is possible to travel at a hi^h speed on it^ without risk of damage. On the Tabriz side of Maraud I found a Soviet check-post v/hich had not existed v»hen .;r. fang passed through too re on June 19th. I called on the Bakhshdar (i.iayor), Ibrahl i Khodjesteh, a youn&gt;; man of pleasant appearance and manners, who gives an impres.sic.• oi being both intelligent and active, and wfao has shown himself ver^/ tov/ards this Consulate-General. He speacs Russian fluently ann unde mfe xl a little gnglish. He was formerly Baklishdar of Mishgin Gha*ir and uertai in Dastem Azerbaijan and appears to be an authority on personalities | and organization of the Shahsevan tribe. I gathered that he had no particular worries i a^:rarian trouble in his district had not open sei 3 ious; the harvest was good and relati ons with the aovie^ authorities and the Tudeh Party not too bad. The district of Maraud has a population of about 14,000 and is purely agricultural, the principal crop being fruit. Mr. khodjesteh estimates the annual produewion ot apricots at about 3,000 tone. The process of gathering anti drying apricots in the sun was in full swing at the time of my visi . 4 . The chief news he had to tell me ;as of a rur ier wwicn bad occurred in Sofyan the night before. So^an ie aidway bet-pen abri. TT^pand. The Bakhshdar’s version oi die af ail was tn-o jour Soviet soldiers from Tabriz had arrived in Hofyan mit the bailiff in chirge of some property beloni^ing the af-esLclf vhatever the reason for their interview, it had been a ItoU one. The bailif: web alleged to have dm,vn a ^volver «ao thereupon promptly shot mead by the -ied iirmy m-,.. ^ ^i ^-n g'M ~ airv the 0 o C.

There was no ougsesticn that if had any poli-l&lt;-al significance. 5 . x wn s told by Ur. khodjesteh that 106 people fron the arancl district, chiefly 'Huhajlro' (formerly residents in the haa joined in the attempted mass uigration to the soviet t erMan l'&lt;v , i : &lt; --:u . -t He said that Persian xm S!3ib^CH^S^kVt?ed t hylsa 0 ic h |oi^ir?M.h Ut exit visas/ r x ■ . Bullard, MeG. A ,i ... . buosador, TAHRAH. ... f . . L . ' . , • l * * *^&gt;ieas, and added that all the Iranian authorities could do was to charge the foiled emigrants twice the fee for the issue of a passport. This remark was rather obscure to me, but there is no doubt that the ingenuity and experience of a Persian official will turn this curious movement to some profit. 6. The road from Marand to Khoi I found in no better condition than when I travelled on it in February. The distance is only some ^ fifty miles but because of the rough going it takes at least tv/o hours. At the Soviet Check-post at the Eastern approach to Khoi I noticed some hesitation on the part of the sentries after they had spelled out my pass, but thought it of no significance at the time. I have always found the soldiers manning these posts in Azerbaijan punctilious in military etiquette and as prompt in the examination of documents as a seemingly imperfect education will allow. Most of them find such difficulty in reading a pass written in Rusr ian and Issued by their own Consular authorities as to prompt the reflection that if, according to the familiar claim, eighty per cent of the population of Russia was illiterate before the Revolution, about the same number must be now semi-literate. I did not intend to make any call in Khoi on my out ward journey and so drove straight through to the check-post on the road leading Westwards out of the town. Here I was told by the N.C.O. in charge that I must go back and see the Soviet Town Commandant. I agreed at once and. the soldier accompanied me back to the Commandant’s office. This was at 12 noon. The Tom Commandant, ;«iajor Jibrailov, a Caucasian* received me in a friendly way, but v/as obviously ill at ease and somewhat placatory In tone. He explained that he had to telephone to the Commandant of the Garrison about me. His communications with this officer lasted, with long intervals, until half past one, when I was told that the Commandant of the Garrison had ordered that I was to be accompanied by a Russian Officer and some soldiers, to protect me because the road to Rezaieh was unsafe. I said this was news to me and asked who was making it unsafe. The Town Commandant replied ’’Kurds and reactionaries and other wicked people**. He declared that a murder had been committed on his own doorstep in Khoi only two days before. This, I discovered later, was true. The escort, he told me* would be ready in an hour. I said I would spend the time in having ray lunch* whereupon the Town Comaandant sent a Military Policeman to show me a place where I could obtain sotae food. This I found to be a Russian military restaurant. The M.P. went ahead of me to reconnoitre* but returned with the news that the place was deserted. He therefore led me to Khol’s one 'hotel'. I mention these details as showint that if it had been the iown Commandant’s intention to prevent me checking his story about the road by enquiry of the local tea-house keepers, he did not fail from want of tiying. In fact, the hotel keeper looked completely blank when questioned about danger on the Rezaieh road, and my Chaufietir .as able to ascertain from a lorry driver who arrived from Rezaieh at this wime that no incident whatever had been heard of on that road. It was not until 4 o’clock that ray escort, a Captain and three other ranks in a Jeep, arrived. It crossed my mind, of course, that there may have been a hope that I should get tired of being kept so long in the heat and flies of Khoi and abandon the expedition, but some experience or people even more practised in the art of amiable obstruction t.an the Russians enabled me to support the delay with equanimity, ano, the Soviet officers were in any case most attentive in assuring me every half hour that the escort was coming at once. 7. I had understood that the danger from which I was being protected was some form of obstruction on the roa^ by oundit f &gt; cr . i Ing parties of Kurds. Although I cannot pretend to any knowledge of military science it seemed to me that the best way of guarding me against such an annoyance might have been for the escort to go ahea • The Captain, however, kept hie Jeep at least two miles behind triost of the way, and on several occasions when I stopped took any^uing five minutes to come up with me. I could understand his not wanting to swallow more dust than he could avoid, but it occurred to nt at a am. time that a Kurd can cut a thread very comfortably in five minutes. I do not know how long a Eeactlonary hand, the Captain vas very strete .;eously placed £® r ' e ®i”^ * h ^ stopped and why. At the entrance to Hezaieh toi/n ray me. 8 ./i reached ilezaieh without incident at about* 8 p* • * cuia put 'i r the Lazar is t Hissioxit whose superior, Father Frans sen, h^as always extended warmhearted hospitality to numbers of this Gons *1 aoe-General. As the next was Sunday, and In addition a public holiday *or the Anniversary of the Persian Constitution, I was able to flee no-one except the Acting Govemor—General Sarhang Zangineh, v/ho cane to his qiiic specially to receive me. o. He told me that he had arranged accom odation i or ne at as w )on as he had received my earlier telegram, and had not thought what I should expect him to reply before I went there. He promised to telegraph sgain to the Fanaandar. I had already heard £rom Father Franssen a report of Kurdish unrest in the district which seemed uc confirm in part the claim of the Consrtandant of the Soviet Garrison at Khoi. The ti*ouble, it seemed, had bromen out the day ot rv arrival, and the people of Rezaich had not failed to make the expected remark: M The last tine, v/ar broke out after the British Consul visited Rczai^h, this time he has arranged It beforehand'. The reierence was to the clash between Rashid Beg Herki’s men and Persian teidarmes y^ ch occurred a day or so after my visit to Rezaiea in reoiuar.y (°'* t,? nl 0^7 it o.4, onra.4Qj, and which was ascribed to my intrigues. AcAidt oi ^.h^T^vent of iaint Vincent, whom I saw the evening oi nr/ arrival, had at once a more accurate explanation ot the outbreaks x is hai'vest time”. Sarhang Zangineh told me that /,ero Beg Herki or Kukia in Baranduz had been demanding blackmail, according to his custom this season, from the peasants of 3 lanej. The peasanws i the Gendax^nerie post in the village. 3ero then demanded the withdrawal of the Gendarmerie post. This i?as refused and so ne sent a force of about 30 of his Kurds, apparently in the afternoon of August *th, to attack the post. There was a rifle battle of several ^ours ama^ion and the Kurds seemed to get the worst of it, ior they wir^v^aw uoou six o’clock to a hill near Kukift and were followed up by the gendarmes. The latter were reinforced and operations continued all night anu, as 7&gt;angineh believed, were still going on. He^had had no casualties on the leroian side, but I understand tna* two villagers of Ouldanlu were killed by Zero’s men at the beginning of the fitting. Besides customary blackmail Zero’s motives in at-tacking tnis village agr have included revenge, as I believe his uncle (or his cousin; was killed by the onme villagers in a fight there ab'Ut two months ago* 10. Sarhang Zangineh had a little to tell me about the activities of the Koraala (Kurdish Independence) party in the yicini-y of ivezaien. Mahabad is the centre of this novement, and its guiding spirit is Gazi Muhammad, the effective Lord of Mahabad, bUu grea^ eiiorta na/e b &lt; n made to win the Kurls of Resaieh - the Herki and t;. .vnax^aii - the cSuse. Zero is a champion of the movement and Rashid Befr Herki who lives at Havana in Rauza Chai, a village w mch formerly was Chaldean Christian but which Rashid Beg took by force some years ago. These two, who range freely up and down the mount line »7es of Rezaieh, are energetic propagandists and valuable liaison , between Iranian and Iraqi! Kurds. There is very f cox.^iunica wi^n across the frontiers a little before my visit ^yyl^han Beg, of the 3ilnn Herkis, the brother, or more probably ohe cousin, oi j had been visiting Havana and Rashid 3eg had gone ^ ac ^ : u ^ to return the visit. Geyyid Khan deg, I was told, t Persian frontier in the nei ^ibourhood ox Dalainpir. He is related to Fattab, the head of the Iraqi Herkis. Gazi Mohamed himself had been on a three days’ visit to Rezaieh shortly before y Hie communications with Major Jaafarov, the Soviet rditioal Otaice. , .. arc regular. I was also told that Mullah Mustafa Barzani was in ennnunication with ffaafarov. I asked Sarhanp Zangineh what suppor^ the Komala had in Rezaieh itself. He said that ®*^ e ol the Kurds living in the town belonged to it, but they kept ^eix activities very secret. He had not himself s en the Rational ind^oendent Kurdistan” a'x&gt;ut which there has been some talx, buv, w seen a Setch of i ts it wae like the Iranian flag, horizontal bands of green, white and red, but ith a sun in the central white bano. This is quite different from a description T have jjreyiously heard ;n Iraqi source which said that it as a red flag with some kind of device./I .vice. But X thinit Xangineh’e description the more rjliable, as the Iraq,! informant mai r v/ell have mistaken the Soviet flac* v/hich the tlahabad Kurds frequently fly, for the Kurdish flag. Zanglneh tho^ht the Kurus in the Mahabad region were all solidly for the Komala, including all the Ilkhani Sadelis, chiefs of the powerful Dehboukri tribe. The only chief of note who stood outside was Qaraini Agha, kziown as Amir ul ’assha’ir, who lives in Lahijun, near Khaneh. Omar iJian of the Shakkak, the old co irade of the late isinail Agha (Simco) /J 7aB t the Acting Governor ral said, a member of t- I had previously heard that Omar Khan had not cooiitted himself. 11. - I mentioned that the Russian authorities in Khoi had said that security on the Khoi-Resaieh road was not good. 3arhang Zangineh said that he had had no report of any particular incident there recently, but, of course, acts of banditry did occur from time to time on any road in Azerbaien. He told me that one Kurdish highwayman, Kopi, who had held ur, and stolen the cargo of 8 lorries .between Maragha and Mianduab some time ago, had recently been arrested in liolduz and brought to Rezaieh. He will be sent to Tabriz for trial. He also volunteered the information that two days before my visit there had been a murder in the principal square of Khoi. (See para.6 above). Two 'muhajirs”, it sterns, had been to see the SotIi in Commandant, and just as they ca.ie ou\ of his office they were attacked by a townsman of Khoi who stabbed them both, killing one and wounding the other. The murderer was arrested and taken to the police station. While the investigation watf proceeding, the son of the dead man carae in and shot at the murderer but missed him and hit the mui hit the mdrclerer’s father who was standing by. The Acting Governor-Oeneral remarked that he supposed there was a woman In the quarrel somewhere. 12. Sarhang Zanyineh came to return my call early in the morning of uy departure fra.t Hezaie.i (August 7th). His visit van brief, but he spoke somewhat more freely as my interpreter was not there, and Zangineh can express himself well enough in French. His theme was the familiar one of Russian interference. A good deal of propaganda was going on for a union of Soviet arid 'Southern 5 ' Azerbaijan, and the RuS; Ians were undouotedly actively aiding the Kurdish Independence movement. In this connection he told me that the day before certain Kurds had arrived and were trying to arrange the despatch of 300 reinforcements from Rezaieh to the Kurds who are fighting against Persian troops in the Uerivan area. They were being helped by the Soviet authorities, but he did not know whether the reinforcements had actually left. On the other hand, five kcmala agents who had recently arrived in the town from Mahabad had been arrested by the Iranian authorities and had been sent to Tabriz by the lake steamer. Throe of them rx?re young men educated in laghdad, speaking Anglish and Arabic as well as Kurdish, Persian and Turki. The other two were tribesmen acting as a bodyguard. Reshed :^eg Herki, it appeared, was now back from his visit to Iraq, as Sarhang Zangineh had just learned that he had had a meeting with I-ajor Jaafarov in his home village of Mavana. , . 13* I had made appointments to call on my Russian and Turkish \ colleagues on Monday morning* Talaat Bey Acharer, the Turkish Consul-General, whom, somewhat to my surprise, I found in residence \he much prefers Tehran), was in good spirits in spite of the deadly f dullness of life in Rezaieh. That it must be dull I con well b:i|ove, as I found him inclined to sigh nostalgically for the past pleasure^ c?f uedda, whei’e he was some years ago First Uecretary of the Turkish \ Legation. He regretted that my very short stay in Rezaieh did not 3\ve H - him time to organize what he called a 'banquet' for me in the country \ outside the town. He told me that in order to put a little life into Rezaieh society he had organized a club. The first meeting, he said, was well attended, but attendance had rapidly declined until the sole members were now himself and the Turkish Vice-Consul, M* Bahry. It was impossible to got the Russians in the town to share in any informal social life. .Talaat ley, whose id strict Includes Kermanahah and iiaiaadan, appeared to be chiefly interested in two topice: the Kurdish question/Question and ’urco-Kus lan relatione*. 'ic had a isoed deal ol Anforoiation about K’-irdish peraonaliti -s and their ioveinents, but N I ar^. not sure that much of it wqb ver*/ accurate. In general, hovvever, he confirmed ny impression that there is increasing activity on the part of the Komala, that the efforts of Iranian and Iraqi members are concert, .:, «ia that they are encouraged and aided by the Rusolan authorities. The main Russian ag&gt; nt in Kurdish questions is llajor Jaafarov, hiiTiaelf a Kurd# Talaat 3ey assured me that the Soviet ^ authorities had intervened in the Bal&amp;nij affair, mentioned in para.? above, and that the Russian Vice-Gonsul himself had paid a visit to Kukia and stopped the fighting. Later, he said, four Kurds ere arrested and brought into Rezaieh. This was not confirmed by the Acting Governor-General, but it is probably true that the Soviet /iee- Consul had been in Kukia the May before. I asked Talaat Bey whether Koraala activities had spread among the Kurds in Turkey. He thought not to any serious extent. propagandists might cross the frontier from time to time, but the tribal or anizatlcn of the Turkish Kurds was in such decay and their conversion to peasant proprietors 3 far advanced that he was sure any Kurdish Nat 1 nalist propaganda among them had little chance of success. There were, of course, occasional disturbances on the frontier, but on traditional lines. Rashid 3eg Herfci, for example, had rvaided into i'urkey a short time ago and driven off some sh . '/hen he returned my call later in the day &gt;alaat BSy Spoke about QiAar Khan of the Ghakkak. The c.iief, he said, had latcl,, l&gt; en called to Rezaieh by the Soviet authorities and given the job of going down to the Mahabad area and making peace between two sections of the pi ran and Govrik tribes who v^ere at variance. Major jaafarov, in giving this comiTdsnion to Omar Khan, had intimated that he was not altogether satisfied with his conduct end even suspected that he was acting in the interests of the British. Phis Omar Khan vigorously denied and said it was a slander put about by an enemy of his, one Seyyid Ahmed of Margivar. 14. The uestiou of Russian territorial demands on Turkey, said Talaat Bey, had aroused great interest in Rezaieh. (This v/as not so in Tabriz, where, except among the Armenian contnunity the news was heard with indifference. ) Talaat Bey discussed the question on uhe lines of the Turkish Government’s statements which have been published. Coming nearex* home he enquired whether the Russian .garrison in Tabriz had been increased. That in Western i*zerbaijan had, lie thought. There were no :.;ore troops in Rezaieh town than usual, but tlie xorces on the frontier had been strengthened. 15. I next called on Mr. Hashimcv, the Soviet Vice-Consul. 1 tolc him how much 1 appreciated the kindness of the Commandant of the boviet Garrison in Khoi in providing me with an escort, but as my Russian was limited I had not been able to understand exactly how insecure the road to Rezaieh was. Ur. Kashimov, speaking to* me in Turki through my interpreter, said that in the daytime there* was no danger, but at night lately some Husoian lorries had been fired on from villages on that road. He did not know who the assailants were, but, as I knew, there were people about who wanted to make bad :)looa between the Russians and British - 'reactionaries” and such like. It would be most unfortunate If any attack was made against ray car and he thou tit it better that I should have an escort. I agreed, and mentioned the incident which had occurred at Mahabad when the British Public Relations Bureau cinema van visited that town on June 24th. (See nrr Despatch No. 8 of June 27th 194£}. Mr. H&amp;shinov 8 ald he had hearTMoout the incident and naa be encli stressed by it. he had visited Uahabad hiaeelf ten days after it snd had severely rebuxed Gazi Muhairaad. 'You Kurds demand independence f - so he sai l his remarks had run - v and claim that you are competent to rule your v/hole nation by yourselves, and here you cannot keep order in y°ur own / village for one night”. I said I felt it was hardly fair to blaJne Gazi Muha, mods he had ‘lone his best and had expressed his regrew ver'/ sincerely to Mr. Lang. (As a matter ox fact he had to 1 Mo.* Lan that the incident was engineered by the Russians). I lays^lf, I added, had considered xhe affair a pice of connon liooliganism ana ' hafi/Bl &lt;31//^ ^ad taken no official notice of it. I asked Kr. t !}® situation a,»nt r the Kurds was in general. But, no ^ unex^ectedlj, he was unconnunioativo. The Moviet Oowsul-General in Tabriz, he said, often \mn better iniorned about the Kurds thin he was and so:netineB aoiced him about i no i den to which he had never heard of. He guy e me a version of the Balanij affair which, while not being go derailed, did not essentially differ from that of the Acting Governor-General, and then turned the enquiry by oaying he had heard -hnt there ./as a serious clash betw-n Kurds and Persian troops in the .leri-van area, (i.e. in the ’’British Zone-). A Kurdish informant had told him a 'certain British General Graith” was visiting the scene of the operat. Had I heard anything about this-. The Hus-ian General Gonmandinv* in Western Azerbaijan, Uajor-Oen ral ASlanoj.r f had .vlsne., to go down thsre too, but liad been prevented by Illness. I confessed that as l f erivan was outside ray district 1 had not h^ara o* the visit of the British General. 16. My limited tine in Rezaieh did not permit me to have conversations with any other ofiicials, but I paid a brief visit tc Amir Hazmi .ifshar, whom I mentioned in my report on my lapt tour (ray Be a eatch No. 2 of Febru ary 16th, 1 945). _ My ex^uirythrouj interpre ter as *:o Vr tiine^han I ni Jit cal... orougat iorto. a l--^ r which expressed so?.ie embarrassment. Amir Kazmi wished to r&lt;.:celv^ ne but he - Ith the BUWSlCM ind fwed the oonseqjBCnces, However, ray interpreter later arranged a meeting, which ± f hoa ^ J ' iave been willing to forego out of regard for the old man, as my only object v/as to thank him for the messages he has sent me on each occasion of our triumphs in this war. My ten minutes with him were spent in listening to gloomy forebodings: Sovlct oontrol V 7 a 8 increasing, no-one was safe from the spying and bullying of the Town Commandant, the end could only be the annexation of Iranian Azerbaijan to the Soviet Union. Among the specific incidents he quoted was the case of two citizens, who, merely for clapping at a march-past of Persian troops, had been taxen to the Headquarters ox the Russian Military police and severely beatem. 17. My enquiries about the 'fudeh Part;/ showed that no more than no'rmal activity vm beinjppursued in Rezaieh. I v/as Interested to learn that the agrarian campaign which io being carried on in the neighbourhood of Tabriz and other gas tern towns had no counterparty in Western Azerbaijan. The Kurds, in any case, control much oi the agricultural land in this Governorate-General, tb: ’'Ajam or Persian villages do not suffer from the weakness of absenteeism as they do in Kastem /Azerbaijan. Meetings had been held on the unemployment question, out I gathered that they were lifeless axiaix^f where the speeches wore just automatic repetitions ox the familiar slogans* There is no industry in Rezaieh and unemployment is not a real Issue. Hand ay, August 5th, was the Anniversary of the Gonstitution. To mark the day the Rezaieh Tudeh party committee received congratulatory callers in the rooming and held an ouw—door meeting, which my interpreter attended, in the evening. Invitations had been sent to the branches in all the surrounding villages, out only about 200 people attended. 'The speakers were Mohamed All Mu'ayir Aadeh/a certain Haideri and another, younger man. Ho ayir Z&amp;deh ds an elderl 3 r and forlorn—looking man, soroe uhiAij like ^^li Ghahbistary, the Tabriz Freedom Front leader: no doubt an ’'old liberal ,, whom the Russians have fished up from the depths to be a figure head to the new movement. The speeches were stereotyped attacks on Sadr ul Ashraf, the Majlis majority, 'Colonisers • (i.e. the British), Gey;/id 2ia and reactionaries gsmerally, made to apply to the occasion by a preface announcing that the Constitution was in danger from those paid tools of Foreign Powers who want to set up a dictatorial government again in Iran. 18. The Superior of the Catholic Lazarist Mission in th Resaieh informed me a few months ago that he wished to recommend to his Order the purchase of some village property belonging to the Archbishop oi Canterbury’e Episcopalian Mission, If the British Mission should be willing:X \ willing to sell* As I haci not seen the property in question I took the opportunity of this visit to go there on the second afternoon of my stay* In my conversation with the Soviet Vice-Consul I mentioned my intention and he immediately said he would come with me* Father Fi'ans&amp;en and one of his Chaldean priests also accompanied rae* The property is in the village of Sir, on the hills about four miles west Hezaieh* There is a track, Just passable for ordinary saloon cars, to the village of Haiderlu from which Sir, about a mile further up the mountain, can only be reached on foot or horseback. I found that Mr. Hashimov had. thoughtfully sent one of hie people ahead in a Jeep to prepare the ground for us - and the preparations included a generous afternoon tea in Haiderlu. Sir is a pretty and fertile spot watered by three springs of excellent water. The property of the British Mission consists of a plot of about half an acre, as near as I could Judge, on the upper side of the village. The house is completely * ruined, being no more than a mound of nibble. The garden is overgrown and neglected, but I saw a few vines which appeared to be bearing. The plot is bounded by a dry-stone wall in poor repair. I spoke with the caretaker, one of the Chaldean villagers of Sir, who also looks after the cemetery of the American Presbyterian Mission. If I understood him rightly (he spoke Chaldean which the priest translated into French) he had his instructions from Captain Bead in Baghdad, but since the war had received no money for his services. These, however, are not extensive, and he has the use of the garden and its vines. I also visited the grave of Newton Worrall, His Majesty*s Consul at Tabriz from 1923 to 1925 , who died at Hezaieh on April 30th, 1925 * The grave, in a comer of the American cemetery, is overgrown with grass and young elm trees two or three feet high, but the stone is in good condition, not weathered at all, and the inscription looks almost new. The boundary wall of the cemetery is in good repair and there is no access for cattle. IQ. I should include in my remarks on Rezaieh the feeling I had all tne time of being,, if not in protective custody, at least under surveillance. As regards myself and my munshi, the surveillance of our movements by the Soviet authorities was exercised tactfully, even pleasantly. I camot attribute the Vice-Consul*s company at Sir to sheer affection* it was only the second time I had seen him, and, though he has had three opportunities, in Bezaieh and Tabriz, to return my official visits to him, he has never done so. Normally, of course, one would look for no other motive than the pleasure of the outing, but after a year’s experience of Soviet Azerbaijani officials I am inclined to think that they do really believe the fantastic reports that circulate about the British Consul’s intrigues among Kurds, reactionaries and other “anti-Soviet eleraents 1 ’ - that is. of course, if they do not put about the reports themselves. A cousin of my Munshi came in for more direct treatment. He was summoned to the office of the Acting Town Commandant, Taghioff, (Safaroff, the Town Commandant, was away) and, after being first threatened with what would happen to him if he revealed what passed at the interview, was asked why the British Consul had come to Re^aieh. When he said he did not know he was told to find out from my interpreter. I instructed my interpreter to tell him the truth; that my visit was part of a normal tour of my district and that I had chosen to come by Rezaieh to find out from the Acting Governor- General what accommodation he could arrange for me at Maku. When the interpreter’s cousin told the Soviet officer this, the latter’s only com ment was to tilt back his head in the gesture by which a Turk expresses an emphatic negative. My interpreter, who is a native of Rezaieh, said he found many of his old friends afraid to speak to him. One whom he was going to approach on the street passed him without stepping, only murmuring “I’m afraid of those men without honour” (“0 bisharaflar”). 20. I left Rezaieh on the morning of August 7th. I had not seen the Captain of ray escort during the time I \,as in the town, though I had asked the Soviet Vice-Consul to ask him to come and see me to arrange the time of departure. He did not cone, but I thought there was little /fearfear of losing him. He turned up, in fact, before we had gone many miles on the road to Khoi. In Shatopur I called at the Bakhshdar^ office, but received the not unexpected message that the Bakhsbdar was ill and could not receive me. In Khoi I called, likewise, at the Farmandar’s office and received a similar excuse - that the Farmandar was away at a funeral but if I cared to wait he might return. The length of my day*s journey, however, did not pemit me to stay. The road fran Khoi to fcaku - about 80 miles - is narrow, largely unmetalled and rough; on the two passes, Kamzian and a smaller one between &lt;^ara 2 iadin and Maryamlar, it is, however, fairly well maintained. The country is barer and stonier than the Rezaieh region, and very thinly populated: between Khoi and Maku there are only three villages on the road. At a distance of about fifteen miles from Maku the hills on the North East fall away and there is a clear view of the Caucasus mountains in Nakhchevan beyond the Araxes river. At nine miles from Maku an apparently good road branches off to nraplar, the frontier town, whence the Soviet tov« and railway station of Shahtakhti may be reached (by Soviet citizens, of course). If the weather is clear ^ount Ararat may be seen at a distance of about 20 miles South East of &amp;aku. 22 I reached Maku at 4 o 1 clock and found the new Farmandar, Sadiq Shahbazi, and the Chief of Gendarmerie, i»t. Sarmadi, waiting for me outside the latter* s house on the main road. I was told that £ locking had been prepared for me and on the invitation of tho Farmancar, who accompanied me in my car, drove through the town without citify. I found that the house was that of Anali Khanum, the widow of the late Sardar of Maku, at Bag he ha Jikh, about three miles on the Western side of the town. The chief of police haa preceded me there, anc after an interval the lady herself joined us. As the widow of the greatest landowner and the foremost 'Najib ,, (noble) of the district she claimed the right to entertain any British official who visited Maku. She has, I believe, in the past been hostess to K« M. Minister, ihe house, v«hil.Q betraying certain lapses of taste not unco muon in the i^ast, is certainly tiie finest and best furnished I have seen in Azerbaijan, and the lady took great pride in showing me over it. elaborate preparations hac. been made for my entertainment that night, but at about o* 3 C I received a brusque message from Captain Akhunuoff, the foviet Town Commandant, that my pass was valid for Maku town only *» the single word ’’Maku” be ing written on it - and that he would not penult me to stay the night in Baghche Jikh. I tried to arrange matters through the Soviet ^ice- Consulate so that I should not make my hostess ana the local Iranian authorities who had provided the accommodation look ridiculous, but the Town Consaandant was not to be moved. I am reportii^ this matter in greater detail in a separate despatch, as it raises the question of my right to move freely about my Consular District. I need only say here that the Town Commandant’s conduct was both unreasonable and discourteous and that I made my view of it plain to the Soviet Consular Secretary, Mr. Muradian, whom I saw that evening. I was lodged eventually, after great inconvenience, in the town at the house of tno chief o! '.yeno.armorxe; but through the Commandant*s forbidding me, and for a long time my interpreter (an Iranian subject), to return temporarily to Bajfbcha Jikh I was not able to recover my luggage or get anything to eat until 1 a.m. 23. The Farmanaar of Maku had been in his post only ten days, and that, I auickly gathered, was nine days too many for him. He is a fcotund little man, grieving for the flesh-pots of the South and very frightened of the Russians, the Kurds, the Tudeh Party and the impending crags of Maku. As may be gathered from the preceding paragraph, the local Soviet authorities treat him with scant respect, and twice curing my brief stay he begged me to do something to have him transferred to a more congenial post. His last post was Khurramabaci, and I understand /thatis tappliedi the Soviet authorities in Maku say that a special permit is necessary and can only be obtained from the Soviet Consulate-General in Tabriz 5 the latter, when applied to, denies knowledge of the regulation* According to the Turkish Consul-General at Itez&amp;ieh, ine Turkish Government offer every encouragement for the use of this Uouter the Turkish railways run a lorry service twice weekly from Trebizondto Bayazid (the Turkish frontier post) and back. I have heard unofficially aijUa returning to Tabriz that the Russians are going to permit traffic more through Bazergan. 27. Maku being a pastoral rather than an agricultural region, prices of all foodstuffs except meat and butter are higher tnan in the other country towns. The region is poor and rocky, and such cultivation as there is barely suffices for the neeas of the inhabitants. I was told, for example, that most vegetables have to be brought from Khoi. i-'uel is scarce: poor quality firewood costs 7GG to 500 rials per khalvar of f&gt;00 kilogrammes compared with 400 to $QQ rials in Tabriz, and 25 O rials in Rezaiehi and in the last two towns the wood is of good quality* The population of Maku is estimated at about £,000 persons. The situation of the tom is striking, being built on the steep slope binder an overhanging cliff on one side of a narrow defile* Enormoue rocks high above the houses seem only precariously attached to their parent mountain, and if any one of them fell it would, one supposes, carve a lane clean through the huadle of rickety buildings. But the people of Maku declare that vfithin the memory of the oldest citizen no rock has ever fallen, and, in the reassuring philosophy of **what hasn’t happened won* t ,f seem to abide tranquilly beneath the shadow. 28. I left Maku at noon on August oth, followed by my escort. From Khoi I made a detour through Julfa. cniefly to ascertain whether that route, although longer, is not easier than the rough road between karand and Khoi. The road from Khoi to Julia, however, though metalled, is in such poor repair, and crossed by so many narrow watercourses, as to make it just as slow and just as hard on a car as the direct Marand-Khoi road. From Julfa to Marana, the road is excellent. At Julfa my Captain left me to complete my journey to Tabriz unescorted. In thanking him ior his care I remarked that the wicked people about wiem they had told me at Rhci must have all run away when they saw him, for I had not seen a single one. I think he saw the joke. I reached Tabriz at 9 p.m. 20 . X am conscious that much of this despatch is a 'Chronicle ox ‘•'•ussian misdeeds, witnessed or suspected, but I feel I may be believed il I v&gt;ay that in this province at least the Russian authorities thesuielves ore largely to bl&amp;iae for the suspicions one entertains about them and for the seeming bias of such reports as this. It is extraordinarily diff icult, X have founu in the past year, to induce even my colleagues of tlie Soviet Consular Service to talk in a frank and open way about local problems. I think it is true to say that the only occasions on which tney «ver volunteer inioxmation about anything that is happening in the province is when they are preparing the ground for seme campaign, or are putting up anticipatoiy justification for some contemplated action. As a result, my information must be di'awn in large part from p^anianand admittedly anti-Kussi&amp;n sources, and no matter how much salt I a Gd to this info mat ion, the substance of it remains. It is with this ireservation in mind that I report my general conclusion ircca tnis tour, I that the Kussians are more determined tnan ever to maintain tneir no Xu on I this province. I was not able to obtain any precise info mat ion on the » point, but X strongly suspect that tho Soviet gax*rison in *«estorn Azerbaijan nas been increased in recent months. Several oi my informants assured me that this was so, especially in the region 01 the Turkish frontier — though I heard in Maku that in that oirtetion Turks have more troops on the frontier’ than the Russians, more, m -.act, than they have had there during the whole war. ^ut I myself cert; inly saw many more Russian troops round bhahpur than I did last February, and one informant said that the hills west of the town were 'swarming' with them. Another told me that there were 4,000 SoViet cavalry encamped in Rauza Ghai, near kavana. The troops* being in camp or training /on/ BaHMPPHH As &amp; A t .. ' / » 5 ■ vT^ (p) . on the mountains no doubt %adB„.kS^^^§i ecL military traffic on Uie roads. At tl*Er same time the amount of foduer and oats imported recently has, X believe, very much increased, ana would at the T^oment seem to be one of the chief loads carried by rail from Julfa J r Tabriz. •5 0. While in Eastern Azei^aijan Russian opposition to the present Iranian Govex'nment as expressed throu;|h the familial* activities and pronouncements of the ludeh Party has not conspicuously increased, I felt that in Western Azerbaijan relations between Russian and Iranian authorities had become definitely worse since my last visit five months ago. I saw this not only in minor day-to-day affairs but in the evidence, which cannot all be fabricated, that the Soviet authorities are definitely encouraging the Kurdish separatist movement led by the new Kcm&amp;ia Society. I have the impression that the Russians are not anxious for a Kurdish revolt to flare up in the near future, urn with their present strength of troops they eodLd no doubt easily extinguish one if it dio. But the Kurdish nationalists believe that the Russians will back their claim to the end, and for that reason are the less inclinea to favour a peaceful astdement of their problem within the framework of the Iranian State. After two visits to the rich district of hezaieh, with its mixed population of Kurd and *Ajam, Muslim and Christian, all living in an atmosohere of suspicion ana fear of taeir neighbours, and after being struck by tne contrast between the potential productive capacity of^the region and the miserable insecurity in which the vast majority of its inhabitants now live, I feel that whatever the justice of the Kurdish cause, any political ambition which seeks its fulfilment by means which must inflame the immature imaginations of the tribesmen who have so often spilled blood there is a crime against the Turkish ana Christian peasants of that province. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obeaient, humble Servant, Sgd/- J.

(8e« last i&gt;iary, pan, 140). Xheir impact on Tabriz industrial life does not appear to have been shattering, indeedi some iiiforaantg report that the auvice they gav^ the local workers was to be more moderate in their demands, honv of their speeches, as reported, contained a.a'thing exceptionable, or indeed, anything at all beyond the usual platitudes, tactics of the delegation have beun different here from what \ they ^er^ in other to ns, this is not surprising* the Union ie in the saddle here, its struggle is not to tame the horse but to keep him going when he v.oulu f&amp;in 11© ciown and die* As for doing anything to damage the central Iranian Government, it is difficult to'see what they could uo that the local experts have not already thought of. ^ xne two outstanuixig xaaabera of Ahe delegation were Akhuadov, who ic chairman of the Oil wor&amp;ers Union at Baku, and Miraa Xbrahimov, ssPd to be Uoaaiasar for education in the Azerbaijan Soviet Republic.

Neither the Iran nor the Paahaiaeh factory was workings the fran because it has no hides, the rasnmineh because it hau no monvy, but the full complement of workers was there to receive the visitors. At th© factories it was remark.d that the visitors ignored the managers and drank tea instead ^ith the Union representatives I this no doubt was proper. They do not seem to have made a very thorough inspection, or asked mere than the obvious questions. The workers may have bd*m expecting to have all sorts of grievances t&amp;ktm up by the delegation, but, as one usually acute and ueli-inio rmed observer remarked, they went quite the wrong way about iti they borrowed from the proprietors of the Ahoerovi Factory their most expensive carpets and beet furniture to decorate the Union represent- ative g room in the factory, they bought sheep and slaughtered thorn in the visitors * honour and in the simplicity of their hospitable Persian * hearts, piled the tables high with cakes ana fruit and *ine, giving a display of aiflucace that must have opened wide a Bakuite eye.'

Tmieh Activitiu£ * The i^arty^ com aign for agrarian reform which has been pox-sued vigorously in various districts of Azerbaijan during the harvest flared up into open violence near to Tabriz on August 10th* and iltu* 'co© of the arguments against the present system of tenure is that the share of the crops taken by the landowner a is too big* The tactics are that representatives of the Tudeh Party go to the villages when the harvest is about to be divided and harangue the peasants and try to persuade Uiem to give the landowner none at all* As noted in previous .diaries# this frequently leads to a breach of the peace* But, most landowners behgg abseatsss ana craven spirited withal, the Tudeh usually get their way* There can be ao doubt that the argument appeals to most of the miserable and neglected peasants of this province. On August 10th* however, the Tudeh decided to visit the rich village of higvan, some thirty kilometres from Tabriz* The owner of -igvan, iia^ji Xhtisham# who is reputed to be 100 years old and is probably 80, is s feudal lord of tne old school, and spends far more time in his village than other members of the class* He was there when a small body of Tudeh agitators arrived* frith him were hie grandson*# two young men of about 20* The agitators attempted to hold a meeting# but were interrupted by H&amp;jji Xhtisham and the peasants wno stood solidly behind their lord* It is nighly probable that the agit&amp;tox*s v^ere roughly handled. They returned ami n^xt morning a party of# some reports say# 200 wrathful Tudeh members, carrying an official of the Department of Juatlcje with them, hastened to bigvaa* The old haj ji and his gram sons met them with a volley which killed four of the Tudeh force ahu wounded two others* Aa far as that most reports agree* On what happened after# the Persian official and Tudeh versions disagree, but most informants agree that the Tudeh force rushed the village, took and killed tne old man and one of his grand sons# mada hie son prisoner, brake into his houses, mare or less beat up his women- folk and roboed them of their ornaments together with everythin^ else about the place that was not tso hot and t o heavy* The Tudeh press# of course# saya nothing about the damage inflicted on the other side* The bodies of tht fallen Tudeh moffibera were brought buck to Tabriz and displayed on the pavement outside thw * arty Headquarters. Angry broadsheets were hastily printed d&lt;mnending veo^^ance an all reactionaries# on the local author!ties who permit tsuoh outrages and particularly ou the version do.mand&amp;nt, dartip Durakhshaal* The Tudeh j dommitteeCommittee got In its story firet «itfc a telegram to the Chah aiv:l Majlis tnd iuCen i arty In Tehraa« an. set a waton in the Telegraph Office to a-alt a reply. The ioUm.ing morning^ August 12th., the Party and Trade Union ordered a general olosiog of Ctoveraaeat Departdumtaf the bazaar and the laatox'itsfc in mourning for the martyrs. This order was obeyed and an indignation meeting was neld in the main street. At some time during the morning, It is not clear just when, but passions were running high all day, a man was seized upon in the belief that he was a servant Of hajji Xhtish&amp;m* was beaten in the street, and according to an oixicial Persian source, dragged to the? Party headquarters and there finished off* The son oi iiajji Xhtisham, Ba ud jLixm, is believed to be still imprisoned on the Party's premises. The day bciore, the Public Prosecutor of Tabriz, Agh&gt; Mussavi, was stopped as he was going up the main street in a Ourriage by Tudeh aembem polled out and severely beaten. One explanation of this assault is that he had been tola to accompany the party to Ligvan and had refused. Another explanation ascribes the assault to the Prosecutor General's failure to tahe any action against ti^ police who shot the workers last October. But, obviously, one# blood has been ehed, anyone remotely suspected of ’riaction' is in danger, v/ithout any Imioediiata provocation. The Tudeh Tarty received a reply to their telegram on bunday night. It was signed py Gadiq («*UBtauhar ud Bowl eh), muhamrnad Sadiq Tabatsbai, Mussein Ala and several ^udeh deputies. It promised that the Tudeh somplaint woulu be au,.ait ted io his Majesty anc that a ‘'suitable n Ustand&amp;r (Governor-Geaeral) would be sent in a few days' time. The telegram also promised that competent persona would be sent to investig ate the chargee made against Bartip BuraThshani. A reassuring state ment on similar lines made by th^ Trims Minister in the Majlis was heard h^re on the Tehran broadcast on the night of August 155th. At the time of writing many of the details of the affair remain obscure. It is firmly believed, for example, in the town that the Soviet Town Commandant anu a party of Bushian soldiers went to Ligvan, when the ±ubeh force had been repulsed* and errscted iiajji Ihtiaham and handed him over to She Tudeh people who then murdered him with a large stone, out a Persian official source does not confirm this Soviet intervention. A judge hau been sent by the Tabriz Department of Justice to Investigate the affair at Li .van, but ao far he has not returned. The remnants of Iranian authority hare are badly shaken, and most of them expect wox*uc to come, ana hava little confidence in the power ox the Central Gov^xmeat to do anything to re-eetablish security. The neada of Government Departments have cent &amp;n urgent telegram to the minister of the Interior i^eqacstin^ imiuediate instructions: they point out that ii the fuuiic Prosecutor can be beaten in the street by the Tub eh Tarty none of them caxi aixy loiter carry out his duties without exposing nimself to ass&amp;ait. however, after a day or so ox excitement anu apprehension, the tension relaxed, and at the lias of writing the ta*n is calm, and the fear of any general revolt against the Iranian authorities seams to have receded. A meeting of the Tudeh Party was held in the Firdausi School on August 14th* The speakers demanded the punishment of the reactionary enemies ox the workers and peasants, act only in Ligven but in other villages where, as they say, TubeA speakers have been assaulted and murdered. All speakers sounded the usual warning that if no satisfactory answer is received froa Tehran, the Party will take matt ex 1 a into its own hands. ISO. TrcaCtom Trout .

In sup ort oi this theory it Is alleged lihat a representative of the Azeroaijan i'udeh Party was present at Tabriz station to meet the emigrants on tneir return* One of the emigrants is reported to have said that the Soviet authorities in liakhchevan took from them ail their Persian money and valuables and told them that they coulo get them back uy applying to the national Bank of Iran on their return to Persia, nut it seems that the Soviet Customs Officials omitted to give them any receipts* Whether the incident was arranged by the Auesian autnorities or hot, there is no doubt that they are making capital out of it in a campaign to work up agitation against the badr Government on the quest ion of unemployment, which they predict will increase until in two or three months it will reach dangerous proportions* ne«B of xtussian territorial demands on furkey ha^ riven rise to maay rumours here.

A slightly more reliable report, unfortunately lacking precise details of time and nlaof says that early in t&gt;une, or at the end of May, there was a skirmish between Hussian and Turkish troops on the frontier between Turkey and Western Azerbaijan* According to this report a Turkish patrol fired on a party of kueeian troops who are supposea to have crossed the frontier to cut wood. The .Russians, wno denied having crossed the frontier, fired back and killed six Turks# They suffered no casualties themselves.

The latest was on June 2oth., in honour of the 22 )tn. annlvers ry of *tn-c i 0 anting 01 the itusaian Acao^uiy oi Gclenccs. xhe dooiety has taken over as premises not only the pavilion in the Tabriz Municipal Garden (which it has occupied since last quell® r) but the whole garden itself. A ^e.rd©n party was held on June 28th. at which the Acting Governor-General performed the ceremony of officially handing over the garden to tne society. The walks had been decorated for the occasion with scores of pictures, done uy Rad 4 Land astern men at note of all a&amp;es, with si^J fodtf VaiiVaaes ht tontgo^ery, .nukov, -is^miower end D« datre dje Tassigny in tjaa most proiui.iaat place# The pictures, it is said* ape to reya.in. ^4 band will play regularly in the garden and there r.JLll bi ! b^lng^^tches and other sporting events, finally, it is rumoured, the charge for uuiuiasio.i v.ill be raised from bO dinars to one rial* The siii men accused of assault ..gainst Soviet students, (Diary ho. 9, para 107) ar* still beln 0 detained by the Soviet Military .. ^lice pending completion oi th^ investigation* The son of the labrii- mullah hi,,a- ul Islam who was host to the -ueik.* ul Islam of Baku on his recent visit (Last Diary* Para 107;, discussing his venerable guest, said that his father hod ^Uu&amp;tioned the bneikh ul Islam closely as to the state of Islam, and particularly the conditions under which mullaas lived in the do vie t Republic* Ins Sheikh ul Islam sumasd it up by sayings f, Y ou know, for the last fifty years all we mullahs hove been respectable beggars** 119. nrneni,..^ hYai- u » It is not yet kno..n here what waa the re8i2 of the election recently neld in hohaiadEin, doviet Armenia, for a now Gatholicoa ol all the Armenians* The last delegate to pass through Tabriz on his way to Acumiadsia was apparently the representative of the Armenians in Greece* He \vas late, it is said, because the Tur ;sih Uovermaent had refused to allow him to go the shorter way through the Dardanelles* Commenting on the assembly of Delegates for the election, the Chaldean Archbishop of Aezuieh - v.no, of course, has little affection for Armenians - said that the Armenian Archbishop of Tabriz did not go to no. miadzin not because of his 82 years, but because he is a declared Dashnak who would not da^e shov his face inside Soviet uusaia* Tac interest aroused by the elections has stimulated a great deal of talk soOut Armenia*s ^historic claims ' on a large elice of what is now Turkish territory* The impr.s. ion is that the Russians are sympathetic towards the Armaniah claim, and, judging from his own conversation, the Soviet CoucUl-Greneral here has done nothing to correct this imprest ion* A rowdy ai-ray between Armenian and Muslim youths in the garde of the Armenian blub in the middle of June led to the Darden's bein closed for a few days* fne affair was of no importance, however, ann the garden is now open again* 120. xudcu an...; fraue cnU^ . There* has been a little more agitation on the theme of unemployment, but there have been no more public demonstrations. Perhaps, all the unemployed having now been registered, ana nothing saving been done about it, enthusiasm has waned.

Besides the Prime minister, the Freedom Front press has had a tilt at the British authorities* it has published (June 14th*) a long letter from Abbas Tabatabayi, formerly Faraandar of Shahabad in the Fifth Ustan, in which he attribut-s his suspension by the Minister of the Interior to the macninations 3f H.m.

The naivete with which this gentleman puts his charges may bo judged from his concluding sentence* 'In my 20 years of service as a Farmandar I have not seen the Russian Consular authorities interfere in the internal affairs of Iran'* There must have been a despera e deaxlh of space in all the other papers of Iran to lead tide writer to seek publication of this remar in a Tabriz newspaper* The Provincial Committee of the Azerbaijan Yudeh Party has published a telegram sent to the Central comuittee of the Tudeh Party on June 14th., proposing to hold a demonstration throughout Iran against the new Prime Minister.

But the President of the Azerbaijan Soviet Republic, Jaafar Baghirov, is said to have made a sensible farewell speech to the Delegation. He apologized for any damage the Red idray might inadvertently have done in Persian Azerbaijan, and declared that Soviet Azerbaijan was always ready to help its friends over the border. It is belie ©d that Wazi Muhammad, the Kurdish leader in Mahadad, informed the Russian Vice-Consul in Rezaieh that he and another member of the Koumala (J.K. Society) would like to go to Baku with the Delegation, but the Soviet authorities declined to invite him. Ihe Sheikh-ul-Islam of the Caucasus, All Sadeh, arrived in Tabriz on May 23rd. for a visit to the Shi*! snrinea of Persia* He was accompanied by two other Russian mullahs. A civic recep tion was arranged for him at Tabriz Railway Station and he waa put up as the guest of Blqat ul Islam, a prominent Tabriz mullah. He stayed in Tabriz until May 30th. and in that time received the visits of, it is said, 7,000 people. (Only one, instead of the usual two noughts would appear to have been added to the actual figure.) The visit gave rise to a prolific crop of bazaar stories on the theme -hat he wasn , t really a mullah but an Ogpu agent, that his learning was faulty and his whiskers fal e. dome of his visitors went in a highly critical spirit to investigate the genuineness both of his Islam an , his whiskers. Both seam to have stood the test. The Iraqi Consul, himself a scholarly bhi'i, called on him and in tne course of a conversation in classical Arabic formed tne conclusion that the Sheikh ul Islssn was a man both of learning ana of piety. The more intelligent T&amp;brizls, of course, aid their best to trap the Sheikh into some admission that the practice of Islam was not free in Soviet Russia* But he seems to have ans.vered honest enquirers fairly and to have avoided the traps adrodfciy enough. Mirza Hussein Vf&amp;’iz, a learned Mullah of Taoriz of strong anti-Communist feelings, asked the Sheikh I ‘Could you and I go together now and in the streets of Baku recite aloud the profession of Unity (^ul, la ilaha ill^llah) ?' The Bheikh replied: ‘‘Inshallah oda olaJakh ,, - 'That also shall coiae to pass, God willing. ' The Sheikn preached a sermon in a Tabriz mosque &lt;n May 27th.- a purely religious discourse, ending v.ith an exhortation to pray for friendship between the Shah and Marshal Stalin. He visited the Boys* School ana spoke on education and religious duties. He left for Tehran on May 30th. A deputation of the unemployed (see para 109 below) Is said to have called at tne Soviet Consulate-General recently and appealed for assistance. Mr. Guliev, the Caucasian Vice-Consul, tola them they should appeal to tneir own Government: there was no rice in the Consulate-General. The Soviet Consul-General has paid a visit of a week or ten days to Ardcbil and Astara. H© reports that the road between Ardwbii and Aetara is very bad and that he could reach the latter town only by making a detour through Soviet territory to the Barth. His visit was possibly connected with recent Russian complaints about the unlawful behaviour of landlords and Shahsevan chiefs in that area, and with the Russian military authorities* demand that the Bhahsevans be disarmed. General Glinsky apparently demanded the surrender of three hundred rifles. The Commanaant of the Persian Third /Division-3 Divisier tfeinir* thin figure is ridiculously high, but says he has kept the Russian Gererel quiet by sending a detachment cf troops from Ardobil to the 3h hesvan c mps to search for arms.

Notices were posted before the middle of Ray calling on sjII unemployed to register at the Union ofiices, and it is now el iv»ei that more than 6,000 are registered* On hay l^-th. a meeting of unemployed was addressed ov Aii Aair Rbisi and Chashm Asar cf the Tudeh Party, and s teieg am was sent to Tehran urging a rogramm* of public works to provide em oyment. it mentioned in particulc• the com leting of the railway from Mianeh to Tabriz; the e.Tplciting cf cil nd other minerals in Azerbaijan; the building of hospitals and other institutions; and the granting cf assistance to en blf the PssVmireh textile mill to re-open, a second meeting waa held on Jure cth• and a telegram in s milai strain despatched to the Prime Minister, the Majlis and the Terrar piost. The telegram was said tc come from five thousand people representing, with their Aperients, 2f ,000 eouls. About live hunared men attended the meet* irg. The party ayitst rs, with an excess of zeal ever logic, had . beer round the factories the day before pressing the workers, in the Uour 1 w’y, to rttend. The Union of Gcvemment Employees, which was said at one time to have been suppressed by order cf the Central Government, held a meeting on Jure 4th. The Acting Governor-General, Mr. A.V. Hikdjou, /waswas present and later volunteered the infomatien that he had been challenged on this point of suppresskn. He had replied that there could he no question of forbidding Gtoverniuent servants join the Union because, under the Fundamental Law, ti ey had the right to take part in any legal combination. From another source it lias been learned that the purpose of this meeting was to discuss the proposed drastic reduction of the staff of the Supply Department and other Governments De artments in Azerbaijan, ihere arr ricaours that as BMiny a? 30^ of the employees of the Supply Department, uustly uhose employed by the day or the wee^., ait to be dismissed.

Hecently, too, the Soviet Consul-General invited the landlords of Tabriz to send two of their number to cull on him and disease their grievances against the Tudeh larty ~nd the situat cn in the villages. The in vital on was accepted air: the two spokCfiCien said they had told the Consul-General that the Hussion policy of courting the lower classes through paid agitators and 'muii&amp;j irs w was quite wrong and they would do well to consider th© interests of the proprietors, who were a much more powerful class. This, cf course, may have been a version 'd*©scalier’*. A few minor incidents of disorder between Tudeh members and others have been repor edj On the lirut cf June there was a fight between two Tudeh members and two Persian soldiers outside the b'Tracks. The soldiers’ comradeii joined in and the Tudah members were thoroughly be. ten up. In addition they wsro hauled off to justice and sentenced (by Military Court) to two years’ imprisonment. There is an unconfirmed report that a Tudeh agitator has been shot dead in the village cf B bui, near Uskp in western Azerbaijan.

IN accordance with your circular despatch No. 38 of the 10th June, 1944, I have the honour to submit an appreciation of conditions in this consular district during the six months ended on the 28th February, 1945. 2. Relatioiis between Soviet and Persian Authorities. —Relations between the local representatives of the Soviet and Persian Governments emerged from the crisis of the oil question fundamentally unchanged; on the side of the Russians a jealous control of administrative authority, so close as not only to prevent any repression of the Left-wing elements to whom the Russians look to provide them with the appearance of popular support, but also frequently to prevent action by the Persian authorities against trouble makers of no particu lar political allegiance whose activities are as damaging to Russian interests as to Persian; and on the Persian side, general acquiescence, combined in some cases with a suppressed indignation and a patient keeping of scores to be settled at the end of the war, not with the Russians, but with the local people who* have grown great in their shadow. Russian intervention in* the administration of the province has been both direct and indirect: the former, usually practised by the Soviet military authorities, operates through their control of all movements of military and gendarmeries, their virtual control of the police and the applica tion of security measures which can put a prompt end to any action the Soviet authorities disapprove of by simply expelling the official who takes it. There are almost daily instances of such intervention, which was seen at its directest in the expulsion of the Commandant of the Third Division, Sartip Khosrovani, last November, and which appears from time to time in an almost absent-mindedly open way as in the orders for the cleaning of Tabriz streets published by the Russian town-commandant last December. Indirect intervention through “popular pressure,’' whether it originates there or not, is closely watched and guided by the Soviet consulate-general, mainly through the intermediary of the two Caucasian vice-consuls, MM. Guliev and Cassanov. All Left- wing pressure is believed by Persian officials to be an expression of the will of the Soviet authorities; they resent it the more as being an affront not only to their national pride but to their personal dignity, as a man resents the yapping of a cur which he dare hot kick for fear of its master. The Soviet authorities, finally, by withholding their approval of the appointment of any Persian official of independence and courage have succeeded in obtaining an administration completely subservient to their wishes: the only senior official of any energy and moral fibre in the whole of Azerbaijan is Sarhang Durakhshani, who, though he has lost his post of Governor-General of Western Azerbaijan, continues to command the Third (Tabriz) Division of Persian troops. That he has done so, so far, without loss of credit, is a tribute to his diplomacy. But the result of this supervision of appointments is a spineless administration which, while it does nothing against Russian interests, does nothing at all in the interests of the country. 3. Objects of Soviet Policy in Azerbaijan. —Nothing has occurred in the last six months to modify the view expressed in the last appreciation (dated 22nd August, 1944) that Soviet practice aims at-maintaining a fluid situation in Azerbaijan which can be turned to advantage at the end of the war in whatever way then seems best to the Soviet Government. It is certainly difficult to escape the conclusion that the weakness of the Persian administration here is largely due to Soviet policy, for with a very little encouragement from the Russians it could be made much stronger. On the other hand, there is little evidence to support the wide-spread belief that the Soviet Government aim at detaching Azerbaijan from Persia and sponsoring its union with the Azerbaijan Soviet [64—98] b {jt&amp;Sixk £ W /O ' AM H 1- Tv*. 23JUN1945 1 A, OFFICE2 Republic. Indeed, on all public occasions—and they are many—when the highest Soviet officials here speak they are careful to emphasise that it is to Persia, not to Azerbaijan, that they speak. Moreover, there has been, in the latter, halt of the period under review particularly, a noticeable absence of separatist propaganda from the public speeches of leaders of the Freedom Front. Some have displayed their Persian patriotism in the most theatrical way. At the same time the materials for a separatist movement exist in plenty in the com munal and racial aspirations of the Kurdish, Assyrian and Armenian minorities, as well as in the language barrier between this province and the rest of Persia and its corollary of greater sympathy with the republic across the northern frontier. Nor can it be denied that below the surface Soviet officials and soldiers of Caucasian race carry on a good deal of propaganda for a Greater Azerbaijan. If these people are not encouraged by higher Soviet authorities, they do not seem to be very actively discouraged. It can scarcely be doubted that, in whatever form Soviet policy may be expressed, its underlying object is to ensure that Soviet political and economic influence remain dominant in this province. Not unnaturally, the Soviet authorities seek to achieve this object by the methods with which they feel most at home. 4. Soviet Propaganda .—The past six months have been marked by a steady strengthening of all overt forms of Soviet propaganda, the chief propaganda vehicle—leaving aside the Freedom Front, which is something more—is the Irano-Soviet Cultural Society. This organisation, which has spacious premises equipped with a cinema projector, holds meetings on an average twice a week. It is served with indefatigable zeal by a number of local people who are either genuine admirers of everything Russian or have a strong interest in appealing so. Its meetings, which are usually packed, run often to inordinate length, beginning with speeches translated in extenso into two languages, and ending either with a film or with a concert of Azerbaijani and Russian music. Its joint chairmen are the Governor-General and the Soviet Consul-General, and theie is a ladies branch under the presidency of the Governor-General s wife. The society is undoubtedly a success, for while everyone recognises that its motnes are purely propagandist and that it may not survive the occupation, it does meanwhile both provide entertainment of a better sort than anything else in Tabriz and it offers a welcome outlet for a good deal of local organising, oratorical and literary talent. 5. A well-stocked Russian bookshop was opened in the town last October. Besides this, there is a recently enlarged reading room from which the news is broadcast and where news photographs are displayed and the progress of the Russian armies marked on a large map. 1 he Russian school, which was opened last November, flourishes. There are evening classes in the Russian language for adult students and much talk of scholarships to Russian universities for local boys and girls. The Soviet hospital, also opened last year, is another institution of obvious propaganda value. Performances by Red army concert parties, visits of artistes from Soviet Azerbaijan, soirees organised by the Armenian community ‘and other enthusiasts, ensure that no occasion for celebration goes unexploited. Naturally, the Red army itself plays an impressive part in Soviet propaganda : its spiritual force of intense patriotism, Stalin- worship and consciousness of its own worker-peasant origin overflows abundantly from its own ranks and stirs the crowds of Azerbaijanis who gather to watch its displays. A vein of commercial enterprise runs through some of this propa- o-anda : the charges of the Soviet hospital, for instance, are high, and there seems to be little or no free treatment (the indigent are sometimes referred to the American or Seventh-Day Adventist medical missionaries), while the frequency with which merchants of the town are laid under contribution by the forced purchase of expensive tickets for concerts in aid of this or the other Russian cause is leading to diminishing returns in cash but an increasing yield of exasperation. On the whole it may be said of propaganda in Azerbaijan that where it is accompanied by some material attraction such as a free show or feast it is eagerly lapped up, for the rest, it is tolerated as one of the necessary nuisances of°war, and at least provides material for the old oriental pastime of finding the hidden motive. . , , 6 Persian A dministration .—A constant theme in local speculation during the last six months has been the coming removal of the Governor-General of Eastern Azerbaijan, Mehdi Dadvar (Vussuq us Saltaneh). But he still keeps his position—apparently through a policy of offering no resistance to anyone in any circumstances. His compliant attitude towards the Russians would, it might be thought, have earned him at least the tolerance of the Left wing, but they are3 as bitter in their criticisms of his supineness as are the soldier citizens. He has, however, escaped any accusation of gross corruption. If weak, he would seem to be reasonably honest, and perhaps his one object is to hold his job down with a minimum of trouble until he can comfortably retire. The Governor (Farmandar), Mubassir Roshani, after a prolonged absence in Tehran, was replaced in February by Muhammad Hussein Muhtashami. Roshani, a man with long experience in the Persian Foreign Service and enjoying a reputation for honesty, competence and punctiliousness, was looked upon by most people in Tabriz as the last hope for any kind of order or efficiency in municipal affairs. His successor is believed not to have the confidence either of the Governor-General or the Russian authorities, and the general opinion, which he himself shares, is that he is not destined to stay long in Tabriz. With the removal of Sarhang Durakhshani from the Governor-Generalship of Western Azerbaijan, the administration of the province has been still further weakened. His successor, Sa’eed Sami’i, though appointed in January, has not yet arrived to take up his duties, and the administration of the Fourth Ustan is in the hands of Sarhang Zangineh, a soldier of good reputation but of quite unknown capacity as an administrator. Sarhang Durakhshani succeeded as Commandant of Persian troops in Azerbaijan Sartip Khosrovani, who was unceremoniously bundled out of the province by the Soviet authorities for his presumed responsibility for the firing which occurred during a demonstration in favour of the oil concession on the 30th October, 1944. Durakhshani has not yet had to face a similar test and it cannot be said whether he would survive it, but he appears to get on very well with the Russians while stoutly maintaining that he will not truckle to the rabble-rousers. He has it to his credit that Western Azerbaijan was perfectly peaceful during his tenure of office there. He inspires confidence in the nervous bourgeoisie and has recently earned applause by organising a demonstration march of Persian troops through Tabriz—the more effective for its being the sole reminder for many months past that the Government of this country is after all Persian. 7. Tabriz Municipality remains only a name. Its head, Ghulam Reza Ilhami, who himself appeared to treat it as a joke, and devoted his serious attention to currying favour with the Russians, incurred the displeasure of the Minister of the Interior by signing a demand for reforms presented by the Freedom Front on the 1st December, 1944, and was summoned to Tehran, as it was thought, to be relieved of his office. The chief of Tabriz police, Mehdi Guli Ziai, equally inefficient and corrupt, was also summoned to Tehran early in the year. But though the replacement of both these officials is imperative if there is to be any improvement in municipal affairs, it is expected that they will have been able to enlist sufficient Russian support to retain .their offices. A new Commandant of Gendarmerie in Azerbaijan was appointed early in January. Like his predecessors, and like most other Persian officials, he complains of the impossibility of carrying out his duty when every move is subject to Russian approval which as often as not, is not forthcoming. His chief task has been the regrouping of the force throughout the province, withdrawing small isolated posts and concentrating his men in a few larger centres from which patrols will operate : a reform which has not the wholehearted approval of Sarhang Kamal, the Commandant of Gendarmerie in Rezaieh. Meanwhile nothing has occurred to sweeten the relations between the gendarmerie on the one hand and the villager^ and Kurds on the other. It would probably take much effort to clear the gendarmes of all the charges of oppression, extortion and corruption that are daily made against them, and it is not surprising that many peasants are beginning to see in the Tudeh party an ally against them. The Kurds still prefer to shoot their own. 8. Mr. Thomas Allen, American head of the Supply Department, and of the Finance Department, too, for a time, under the Millspaugh regime, failed to make much impression on the muddle and malpractices attending the distribution of monopoly goods. The task was more than one man could hope to accomplish and, in spite of his ferocious zeal, which shocked and alienated all his Persian subordinates, some of the worst scoundrels continued to wax fat under his very , nose. Since his departure yet one more effort is being made in Tabriz to issue ration cards in numbers corresponding roughly with the population, while in the country districts distribution appears to be haphazard and accompanied by such complicated frauds as probably lay at the bottom of the recent riot in Mahabad. A Persian head of the Supply Department has now been appointed, but it is too early yet to judge his ability. 9. The Freedom Front and Tudeh Persia .—The Left-wing movement has made steady progress during the six months and has become, after the Soviet [64-^98] B 24 authorities, the most active force in the affairs of Azerbaijan. It underwent a test at the crisis of the oil concession agitation and emerged from it stronger than before. The series of demonstrations organised to protest against Sa’id s policy showed the leaders how many men they could put on the street, and the clash with the police on the 30th October and the subsequent disarming of the police by the Soviet authorities convinced them that, in a “ good cause ’ at least, they could have matters pretty much their own way, In the later stages of this agitation there began to be seen the rudiments of a party discipline which were later to be developed. When the oil question was dropped there followed a month of comparative inactivity, but during this time a new theme was being built up— the demand for provincial councils (Anjuman lyalati), for which provision was made in the Constitution of 1906, but which have never been formed, although it would appear that some such council did function for a short time in Tabriz about 1906. At the same time party propagandists were trying to interest the peasants in their programme, and agrarian reform was given prominence in all speeches. On the 1st December a ‘‘ monster ” meeting was held which was supposed to be attended by large numbers of peasants. In the event few country people turned up and the crowd of 5,000 was chiefly composed of urban workers on whom the Tudeh party and trade union could bring pressure. On the 11th January the ct First Regional Conference of the Azerbaijan branches of the Tudeh Party ” was held at Tabriz. It gave rise to alarming rumours among the more nervous of the propertied citizens, but the resolutions it published contained nothing but what the party spokesmen had been urging for months past. The most interesting feature was a bid to attract Kurdish support. The party claimed that they were promised support by certain chiefs of the Shakkak tribe, but the precise nature of these promises is unknown. It can only be said that whatever those particular chiefs may have promised, they can he relied on to carry out their promises only if it suits their own personal interests. Since the conference there has been an intensified recruiting drive and an effort to tighten up party organisation and discipline. 10. It is difficult to see any clear distinction between the Freedom Front (Jibhei Azadi) and Tudeh Persia. There can scarcely be any member of the former who is not also a member of the latter and there would appear to be no good reason for the formation of a second organisation, unless, indeed, the object be to absorb Tudeh Persia in the Freedom Front, thus getting rid of some of the opprobrium that attaches to the old name and making a wider appeal. The last six months have seen a great many meetings and discussions about the organisation of these bodies, with the publication of rules and regulations and orders for the election of a bewildering number of sub-committees. But through the fog of resolutions and proclamations may be dimly discerned the lineaments of some scheme in which the Freedom Front stands as the supreme programme-drafting body and co ordinator of all progressive opinion in the province, and from it stem two executive bodies : the Tudeh party, charged with securing the election of Freedom Front candidates and with putting forward the Freedom Front’s programme in the Majlis; and the Workers’ Union (Shurai Muttahidei lyalati Ittihadiyehai Kargaran va Zahmatkashan Azerbaijan—sometimes known by the shorter name of Shurai Muttahidei lyalati Azerbaijan) which endeavours to put into practice the Freedom Front’s economic and industrial programme. But in practice the functions of the three bodies constantly overlap, and the same group of leaders appears to dominate them all. 11. The programme-drafters have laboured to such purpose in recent months that their latest published effort at generalisation comes to nothing more precise than saying that the aim of the party is to improve things in general. But from the speeches of the leaders more particular points can be picked out: The preservation of the integrity and independence of Persia; the establishment of a truly democratic and liberal Government; the formation of provincial councils to safeguard local interests; agrarian reform; economic development; punishment of “ traitors ” ; firm friendship with the Soviet Union, On the face of it there is nothing in such a progamme to alarm anyone, but it is customary for the more conservative part of the population to see the published progamme as a cloak for more sinister goings-on inspired by the Soviet Consulate-General. According to this view, the Freedom Front aims, at worst, at an independent, bolshevised Azerbaijan; at best, a prolongation of the Russian occupation. It is true that both the language and the actions of the Freedom Front belie the seeming mildness of their pogramme. “Reactionaries” in the Central Government, such as Seyyid Zia ud Din Tabatabai, and the local representatives of the Persian Government are attacked in the most violent terms, and in the recruiting drive in5 both Eastern and Western Azerbaijan the methods of intimidation used have included assault and threats of murder. 12. It has been said in a previous appreciation that the Tudeh party’s appeal had no ideological content. As regards its usual propaganda among the workers and peasants, this remains true, but it would be wrong to think of all the party leaders in Azerbaijan merely as Russian-paid tools without any principles of their own. While immediate self-interest may be, as in any other Eastern political party, the chief motive, some of the leaders, like Shabistary and Isfahani, have a grasp of Communist theory, and the party has attracted a number of young men who are probably genuinely intent on social reform. Among them there is Mohamed Mohamedluyi Abbasi, who has already translated some of the shorter works of Marx and Lenin into Persian. It is not in any case to be expected that any attempt would be made to preach theoretical communism to such an ignorant and backward proletariat as this. The party seems to have chosen in practice the shrewder way of trying to make the economic and social life of the province conform to a pattern derived, however remotely, from Socialist theory: the organisation of the various trades within the Workers’ Union, the consequent raising of wages and imposing of conditions of work, the control and correction of employers, the adoption by party officials to some extent of police and judicial functions, and the project of operaiing bankrupt factories by and for the workers (as yet only a project) may all be seen as part of this pattern. 13. The Freedom Front-cum-Tudeh party with Russian encouragement and protection (as being the most useful auxiliary of Soviet policy in the province) has been able to cast its net very wide. It has members from every stratum of the population : loafers and bravos of Tabriz, porters, factory-workers, peasants, craftsmen, shopkeepers, students, journalists, even merchants and landlords as well as political adventurers of all kinds. Its organisation is muddled and its policies ill-defined, yet there are increasing signs that it is becoming self-conscious and is trying to bring some order and discipline into its ranks, perhaps, as recent proclamations would indicate, by the expulsion of the gangster element. It has, moreover, adopted recently a more patriotic attitude, and even its worst enemies admit that it talks sound sense on a number of local problems. Set against the corruption and incompetence of the local government and the profiteering of the wealthy its influence is not wholly evil. 14. Trade Union Movement .—Most of what has been said of the Freedom Front applies to the Trade Union Movement. But the union faces a problem of its own. It has been largely successful in its legitimate struggle for better rates of pay and working conditions, only to find that the beginning of the industrial slump in Azerbaijan is threatening unemployment on a large scale. The weapons which the union developed to wrest advantages from the factory owners when things were going ’well—strikes and intimidation of individual owners—are useless against intangible economic forces. A factory owner may still be imprisoned by union officials, but that does not solve the problem of where to find the money to pay the workers.. There is some talk of the workers taking over the factories themselves, but the same factors that make it impossible for the owners to run them will, of course, continue to operate, and there is every sign that the workers’ exasperation will find the obvious outlet of violence. Meanwhile the last six months have seen a steady extension of the influence and membership of the Workers’ Union : trades‘previously unorganised, such as the porters, have been drawn into the fold, rates of wages have been fixed at higher levels, and the union’s authority made pretty well absolute. There have been one or two feeble attempts to set up rival unions, but these have been crushed as soon as announced. Such Government machinery as did in theory exist for the settlement of trade disputes—the Chamber of Industry and the industrial powers of the Farmander —seems to have fallen out of use entirely. Only in the matter of the Union of Civil Servants has the Government reacted : orders have apparently been received from Tehran that any Government servant joining this union will be dismissed. But it is most improbable that these orders will be carried out here. 15. Kurdish Affairs .—Little has been heard during the period under review of the Kurdish autonomy movement, Gazi Mohamed, who is generally thought to be its champion in Azerbaijan, has been absent most of the time in Tehran. There have nevertheless been a few rumours of increasing membership of the “ J.K.” (Young Kurd) Society, and of Russian interest in it. The operations conducted by Sartip°Hushmand Afshar against Hama Rashid at Baneh in September-October had few repercussions in this Consular District, though the subsequent tour of Khalil Fahimi, Minister with .Portfolio, provided an opportunity for both the “ J.K.” Society and individual chiefs to put their point of view before the Persian6 Government and to declare their loyalty to the Shah. These professions of loyalty were probably genuine; there is nothing to show that the Kurds of Azerbaijan are prepared to co-operate even with each other, let alone with those of Iraq, and though there have been one or two reports of the coming and going of Kurdish agents across the Iraq frontier these visits would seem to have produced no tangible results. While the Kurds are no more consistent in their outlook and no more uniform in character than any other of the races that make up the population of Azerbaijan, it may be said that, in general, what they want is not political independence so much as a square deal from the Persian Government. The chiefs, being big landowners, have everything to gain from a state of security which will enable them to obtain the maximum profits from the cultivation of wheat, tobacco and fruit. But old tradition and bitter experience make them resent any attempt to impose this security by Persian bayonets. A policy of extending medical and educational facilities to the Kurdish districts, of ensuring just distribution of monopoly goods and granting assistance for town and village improvement, carried out by sympathetic and honest officials, Avhile leaving responsibility for public security largely to the Kurds themselves—in brief, fewer gendarmes and more sugar—would probably remove most of the grievances the j Kurds at present nourish. 16. For most of the period, being winter, the peace of the Kurdish districts has been broken only by minor incidents of robbery or assault. But in February a chance encounter between a small body of Persian troops and a few Kurds of the Herki tribe in Rauze Chai near Rezaieh led to the death of a Persian officer and a punitive expedition against the Kurds of the district in which about five Kurds were killed. As the Kurds were followers of Rashid Beg Herki, who is said to have joined the Tudeh party, this incident seemed at first as if it might be the curtain-raiser to more serious attacks on Persian authority in Western Azerbaijan, Tut it now seems probable that it arose out of nothing more than the traditional hostility between Kurd and Persian soldier. At about the same time there was an attack by Kurds in Mahabad against the police station there. Five policemen were killed and the station sacked. There is even less political significance in this incident. The most likely explanation is that it was caused by dissatisfaction with the way monopoly goods were being distributed. It seems, however, both to have spurred the Persian Government to make a show of authority in that district and to have convinced the Soviet authorities that such a show is necessary. Preparations are now afoot to establish a Persian garrison in Mahabad and it is reliably reported that the Russians have given their assent. 17. Fifteen Shakkak and Herki chieftains, among them the young son of the late Ismail Agha (Simqo), came to Tabriz for the Tudeh party conference and the party claimed that they had offered their support. Only one of them, however, Rashid Beg Herki of Targivar, seems in fact to have joined the party. Both Persian officials with experience of Azerbaijan and Kurdish informants alike are emphatic that the Kurds would never make common cause with the Tudeh party, but at the same time there are well authenticated reports from Western Azerbaijan of Kurdish chieftains using the threat of raids to force Persian villagers to join the party. The explanation is probably that one or two chiefs see in the activities of the Tudeh party a promise of unrest and a weakening of Persian authority which they may exploit to their own advantage. It is certainly most unlikely that any part of the Tudeh social and economic programme would appeal to these feudal highlanders. The visit of these chieftains to Tabriz, the Tudeh party’s flirtation with them and the marked increase in Tudeh party activity in Western Azerbaijan led some Persian officials, as well as the more easify alarmed merchant classes, to believe that some kind of coup d’Etat was being plotted by the Tudeh party in conjunction with the Kurds and that the spring would see a serious attack on Persian authority in Western Azerbaijan. Nothing has occurred to confirm these fears and they seem now to a great extent to have been allayed. 18. Economic Situation .—The near approach of Allied victory in Europe is having precisely the effect on Tabriz trade and industry that was long ago predicted. It is doubtful whether anything could keep the costly local industries going, but the paralysis of commerce is perhaps largely psychological, it being the deeply rooted conviction of the dealers that the defeat of Germany will immediately open the flood-gates of plenty, and that Persia will be at once deluged with cheap imported commodities with which the high-priced stocks of the local merchants cannot compete. Over the last six months there has been an increasing willingness to sell and an increasing reluctance to buy. Wholesale prices have *7 reflected this tendency, but with a certain hesitation. Retail prices, except for the month of October, when there was a fall in nearly all food-stuffs, have remained substantially unchanged. The Russian Trade Agency has continued to import goods for the local and Tehran market, the chief commodities being cotton piece-goods, sugar, crockery and glass-ware, cod-liver oil and small quantities of chemicals for the soap and match factories. The textile and sugar imports have done nothing to lower prices and force the release of hoarded stocks which is so desirable, as the Russians have shown as much determination to get the highest prices as the local merchants. Their purchases both of grain and dried fruits have declined. The Irano-Soviet Oil Company has made a bid— not always by means of legitimate persuasion—to capture the retail trade in paraffin to the disadvantage of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Business in dried fruits, the principal export of the province, has not been brisk; after the ceasing of the autumnal demand from India in December there was practically no export except a consignment of about 50 tons bought by the Russians. The carpet trade has fluctuated; direct export to Syria, Iraq and Egypt has dwindled to a trickle, but there have from time to time been purchases on some scale for the Tehran market, destined, no doubt, for ultimate export. Prices have fallen, but costs in the industry have risen, and failures of small factories, noticed in the last appreciation, have continued. Stocks of Tabriz carpets are said to be getting- very low. 19. As observed in paragraph 14 above, the inevitable slump in Tabriz industries has begun. Of the four biggest factories—two textile and two leather— one textile factory is virtually bankrupt and the others are nearing the verge. It is difficult to see how they can survive. The disproportionate cost and poor quality of their products closes the export market to them and the same costs prevent them from satisfying the local market. With two well-equipped cotton and woollen mills and two modern tanneries in the city half the population is in rags and unshod. The factories could only carry on by cutting down the number of their operatives to less than half and by reducing wages. The existing labour agreement (the Sheikh award) prevents them from dismissing employees, and the strong trade union, arguing incontrovertibly from the high cost of living, rigidly opposes any wage cuts. In this dilemma an increasing number of factory owners and shareholders are seeking to rid themselves of their liabilities and migrate to Tehran. The shares of the two tanneries and one of the textile mills are quoted at present at 10, 5-9 and 5-4 rials. There has for long been a flight of capital from Tabriz; the price of real property is low and there are no buyers. 20. Local Attitude to Great Britain .—The agitation over the oil question was singularly free from references to Great Britain. But this was probably due to directives which later fell into disregard, for in the later months of 1944 Left-wing journalists began to assume a tone of righteous indignation over British policy in Greece, and events there were quickly made the excuse for open attacks on British policy in Persia, where, it was represented, we were intent on “ colonisation,” using as our tool c£ Mister Zia ud Din the Englishman.” Since January, no doubt as a result of the joint action of His Majesty’s Ambassador and the Soviet Ambassador, this campaign has died down and there have been few references to Great Britain in the local press. While the Left-wing pictures Great Britain as the big bad wolf of imperialism, the attitude of the merchants, landlords and officials towards us is one of disappointment and reproach. Unreasonable as it may seem, there is a belief among this class that if the Russians and the Tudeh party behave badly it is because the British let them. Great Britain, they argue, brought the Russians into Azerbaijan; she ought both to keep them in order and see to it that they depart at the proper time. But they rather fear she won’t. _ ’ 21. The principal vehicle of British propaganda in this province is the printed word. Publications in Persian, supplied by the Public Relations Bureau at Tehran, sell steadily, and over the past six months there has been an appreciable increase in the demand for the more attractive magazines, such as Shaipur, and others produced by United Publications, India. Distribution in the various towns of the province is in the hands of local newsagents, who find the trade profitable. Publications in English have only a restricted sale, as the knowledge of the language is not widespread, but there, is evidence of a desire to learn and text-books have sold comparatively well. A good teacher of English would be a most useful adjunct to our propaganda here. The travelling cinema , van, though its activities were somewhat restricted by the delays in obtaining passes from the Soviet authorities, put in some good work up to the end of October when the weather became too bad for outdoor shows. The Soviet authorities haves in general shown themselves well disposed towards our propaganda. Red army officers and men frequent the Public Relations Bureau shop, and cordial relations exist with the manager of the Russian propaganda shop, who takes from us a certain number of Russian publications. Broadcasts of the B.B.C. news in Persian over the P.R.B. shop wireless continue to attract a regular band of listeners. 22. Conclusion .—As the European war draws towards its end the question that is uppermost in the minds of the official and propertied class of muslims in Azerbaijan is whether the Soviet Government will in fact terminate the occupa tion on the date that has been laid down. That there should be, in spite of consistent Soviet declarations, any doubt about this is a measure of the suspicions of Soviet intentions entertained by this class-—suspicions which, deeply rooted in religious and racial prejudice,' have unfortunately been reinforced by the dubious conduct of Soviet officials at various times during the occupation. While the constant complaint of the local Persian Government is that the Russian occupation makes a strong administration impossible, whatever preparations the Persian Government may be making to set up such an administration when this obstacle is removed are not discernible in this province. On the other hand, the efforts being made by the Left to increase membership of their organisations and , strengthen their authority should undoubtedly be interpreted in part as a preparation for the day when Russian protection is withdrawn. There will almost certainly be trouble on that day, for if the natural reaction of the muslim ruling class will be to revenge themselves on the pro-Russian element for all the humiliation, repression and injury—real or fancied—which they have suffered during the occupation, the reaction of some at least of the Left-wing leaders will be to make a struggle for the retention of the hopes of social betterment they have glimpsed during the Russian connexion. If the Persian Government can find a few competent and liberal-minded civil officials, and if the Tudeh and trade union movement can organise itself for disciplined and co-operative work within the framework of a Persian Administration, there is a hope that Azerbaijan’s readjustment may be brief and not too painful, indeed, a hope that the lessons learned during the occupation may be turned to the permanent benefit of this province. 23.

It is possible thet this belief is based cn nothing more than s:me irresponsible newspaper article, but that it should be considered by the Assyrians as a genuine possibility is evidence of the profound mutual distrust ana hostility still existing between this community 'ne the Muslims, The Assyrians, who, as described by Either Franssen after 30 years experience ;f tnem, ire ^ rude, proud, unteochable end stubborn race - pens am are C nal- c.. O' ruia - seem t have as little affection for their dmenian fellcw- Christi ns as for their Muslim neighbours, and equally little ability to agre^ among the four sects into which their own community is split. Haunted by the memory of past pogroms, acutely conscious of their' in creed, language and race ana aware of the helplessness number in the midst of an alien people ('Nous semraes la maison', said tim archbishop), they see before tnem a future heavy with menace. In their belief, one withdrawal of the Russian army will create a situati.n comparable with that when the Ts-rist fbrees withdrew in 1913, and the Muslins revenged themselves by massacring as many of the Christian community as they could lay hands on. It may be observed that these forebodings arc in no way lessened by the t'Ik of many Iranian Muslims, wim openly lick their nticipati n of “taking it out cf“ the Assyrians ana Armenians Red .imy goes.

The existence of thx Assyrian Levies, I saw, has a deep significance for them in this country where they are sedulously barred from every position of trust or uthority.

A son of .air Asad of the Pehboukri states that his father shortly alter the incident received a auamouB from dart ip huabaaand Afshar, the conqueror of ila*aa Haaald, who is now in occupation of h.rdasht, to to Gaq.iiz and meet him* Amir Aead sent his son, wno, on arrival found that Hushaand had gone to Senanaaj * X'he son spoke to him on the telephone and was inst ructed to tell his fa',her that Husiuuand Intended . snortly to proceed to mahabad with a lar^w force of troops and that he desired the co-operatim of ^■uir Asad.

Amir Aaad is hesitatixxg to obey th^. order, well knowing husamand’s reputation as a hard-nater and tioe bitter hostility of Aurcia of all tribes towards him; realising too, no doubt, the extreme delicacy of the situation that would be cau. ed uy his entwring Gaai Achamued’a territory with an armed tree, and not knowing, finally, what the Russian attitude to the proposed expedition is. Gazi m aammed f a son said taat his father had been alio ed to visit uabri z for a fc months on parole, whithe chiefs wno accompanied him to Xeiiran last „ ear were bein^ kept there as hostages, it would seem, ujWvVw-r, that the Government nave recognised his usefulneea in -*axiabad i sui&amp;xe a* stiycd in iabri* n-.; ^ore than a day or two, and then hurried to Alahab&amp;d where, according, to all reports, he upbraided the ;)articipat ra in the riot and accused them &gt;1 undoing all the atlent work he has put in to try and build up some sort of law-abiding Kurdish society in the place.

This alternative does not suit the Persian Government since troops at Rezaieh are not numerous enough. On the other hand they fear that if Bukan troops were sent°to Mahabad the Russians would ensure that the Kurds re sisted. The troops advancing from Bukan were met by Governor of Mahabad with some [gp. undec.] and informed that the Kurds of Mahabad would resist any attempt to occupy the town.

Local life being so uneventful,the Tabrizis are showing an increased interest in events in Tehran and abroad. The manifesto of Se/yid Zia ud in tne T ® hran P a P er ^a’di Lmruz' on 29th. Azar (December ^oh.,1944; has provoked a sharp reaction here. It has annoyed the Tudeh *arL/,und their Tabriz organ,'Kharvar-i-Lov w ,has published a riooste which is largely a personal attack on Seyyid Zia. On the other hand the conservative classes of the town have been very favourably impressed: xjuixmii*if**k* comment has been heard praising the moderation,truth and patriotism &gt;1 tne manifesto,one merchant going so far as to declare that witn one clever article Seyyid Zia has won the sympathies of half Iran. clearly did not like it,and they are reported' to &gt; all the numbers of that issue of 'Ka'di Tiaruz' But the manifesto has been very widely read. , r.. - t0 Bcyyid Zi a ,who has always been represented nert, ae a British creature,has n w begun to oe mingled with open criticism of Britain s past and present policy in Iran; while events in urreece hav_ been seized upon b 0 one Communist writer as an excuse for o thorough-going denunciation of British Imperialism,which stoos snort mly oi accusing us ol re-establishing fascism in Greece. Local reactions to news of Doctor Millspaugh’s affairs show a correspondence with the conflicting interests of the classes: the merchants,landlords and officials are elated at the cancellation of his special powers,for the,; see now either the speedy abolition of such inconveniences as price control and rent restrict!on,or at least the eerts„nty that these controls,if applied by Persians,can oe evaded in :/ iQ traditional rersian manner. Such articulate reaction as there is irom the poorer classes indicates that they pessimistically expect a period of intensified profiteering,exploitation and malversation of monopoly goods.

Aajor-ueneral Cjlinsicy,in coBu&amp;and of Russian troops in Azerbaijan, nas written to the Governor General of Eastern Azerbaijan,^ehdi Dadvar, complaining of oiieits of Russian telegraph wire. The Russian wire, it ao— pears,is hung above tne civil lines, nd the General,according to Mehdi hadvar,accuses uhe thieves of delioerately selecting ^he Russian ^ ; ire and leaving tne Persian. The Gov mor General felt that the accusation was a little far-fetched,but quoted it as an example of the unreasonable tone which,he admits,is Decoding more evident in relations b tween the Ruseian military and the Persian civil authorities. The Russian civil authorities, m the other hand,are evidently at soaie pains to maintain, outwardly, aR least,a correct* attitude towards the local government. The Soviet Consul-General paid a visit to Maku shortly before Christmas. Religious dem uistrationa in connection with the Muharram ceremonies were in progress,and as there was some excitement,the farmandar expressed to M. -uatveev his anxiety lest some disorder occur, m. ^atveev replied that religious celebrations were a purely internal affair,and he'would not drsam of intervening. The Soviet Consul-General is apparently a little sensitive aoout the accusat ons,mrde in some quarters in Tenran,that the Soviet authorities have intervened in Azerbaijan affairs deliberately t0 ProvoKe disorder for their own ends, he followed his story about the kuharram ceremonies in M a ku with a reference to the 10th. kuharram dem astr a tions, in Tehran in which a man was killed; the kettle,he i iolied was proved rather cleaner thyn the pot. ihe boviet authorities have recently insisted on the expulsion from Azerbaijan of a nuiuber of Persian subjects whom they consider undesirable, particularly from Rezaieh and Khoi (Gee i)iary for 194,4, Ro. 20 , para S 14 ,,out so far they have not asked for the expulsion of any me’from fabr- iz. The one person whose departure they might have demanded,Hussein 1 ishakji,the editor of tne newspaper }, Tabriz !f ,was su ua neu by the Governor General and advised to le ve the city of his own accord. He did so. The Governor General nas now received a circular from Tehran instructing him what if the Soviet authorities request the expulsion of any more people ne is to refuse,and sk them to refer to the Ministry of Foreign ,off airs. ^ . , About 6 m 0 schoolboys who have finished their studies at the Persian uign School have registered at the Soviet Consulate-General as applicants for selection under a scheme whereby free places at certain Russian Adversities are to be offered to Azerbaijani boys next September. Those v.uo are perfect An mussiau will enter Moscow University,those whose oest language is Armenian will go to urivan,and tne others,speaking Turki, to naku.

Tne course in medic .ne .»ill take live years, that in engineering,four. everything, inclmbing their personal outfit,will be provided free of charge oy the soviet Government. But they hive oeen advised to t ke with them aiV woollen garments they may possess. If they wish to return to Azerbaijan lor tne annual holiday of one month,they must do so at their own expense, out if they viah to spend tne month in visiting some other part of Russia,their expenses will be paid. The boys selected will receive preliminary instruction at the new Russian school in Tabriz.

The classes appear to be well attended. The instruction is in Turk!. ^ a new Soviet propaganda Shop (distinct from the Russian bookshop) ho been opened with a frontage on the main street. The shop’s main purpose is to oroadcast the wireless news a-d to exhibit photographs, waile providing facilities for reading Russian papers. There is at present on show a photographic diaplap divided into six sections devoted to aspects of Russian political,cultural and military life,with captions in Russian and Turki. The reading material provided includes copies of n 'The Communist'Krokodil and the local Turki newspaper 'Vatan Yolinda rt . 6* Tuaeh Rarty Activit ies. There seems to have been no very vigorous attempt xo stir up opposition to the manifesto published by Seyyid Zia ud Jin on the subject of M. Rt«vtaradze ’a criticisms of the recently passed oil concession law. it was advertized that a puolic meeting would be held oy the ireedom Rront to protest against this manifesto on January oth. nut not more than a hundred people assembled,and as the flurries of snow settled down into a steady fall these soon drifted away and the meeting died after about ten minutes of the usual oratory. mohammed bir^a,the leader of the workers’ Union,and All Amir Khizi,the leader of the Tudeh narty in Tabriz,nave go^e to Tehran,to consult,as it is thought,with Trade Union and Tudeh leaders there both on the reorganization of the Azeroaijan Union (Shurai kuttahidei lyalati Azeroaijan) and on the line to be pursued in the campaign for the establishment of a Provincial Committee. Little is heard of this campaign at the moment,out it is generally fal$ that the agitation will take a new lease of life when Birya and Khizi return. The Governor General has taken a step which he hopes,without much confidence,will have an effect on the provincial committee question: he called Ali Shahbistury and a few other prominent members of the Tudeh Party to the Governorate and read them a little lecture,pointing out that though the election of a provincial committee might be according to the Gonstitution,it would only be legal if it were elected with the approval of the Central Government,and urged them to seek permission from Tehran before taking an u action here. He also enlisted the support of Satvat as Galtaneh,a man of old and noble family who enjoys much personal influence nd prestige in the city,and asked him to give the Tudeh leaders friendly advice in the same sense. Such advice,however,is not likely to carry the slightest weight with the Tudeh leaders; if they do decide to drop the campaign,it will be for other reasons* To judge from the remarks of one informant in close touch with the Tudeh Party,there is no intention of dropping the matter at the moment. It is even being said that if no favourable reply is received from Tehran,the Tudeh Party will agitate for the separation of Azerbaijan from Iran. Azerbaijan they claim can grow all its own food; they would throw out all the Tehran officials,and then see 'who would suffer most,we,or Tehran”. The Tudeh paper ’’Kharvar-i-Aov* reports a meeting held by the Freedom Front at uiiauduab on December 20th., 1S44. The speeches followed familiar lines,demanding the election of Provincial Committees,the prosecution of Sa’id,the abolition of the A*I.C.G. concession *in order to balance Iran’s foreign policy”,and the trial of those^respon- siole for the murder of workers in Tabriz. A telegram embodying resolutions on these points was sent to the Shah,the majlis and the Tehran press* 7. nab nr Situation and Union Activities . On December 29th.,1944,Ahmed Isfahsni,of the jorkers 1 Union,and Ali Shahbistary of the Tudeh Party cullea on the Director of Posts and Telegraphs in Tabriz and demanded the increasing of the postmen’s wages under threat of a strike. The Director replied that he had no authority to increase wages. Four postmen thereupon wrote a letter,not to the Workers* Union,but to the Tudeh Party, sett ing forth their grievances, a,id sent a copy to the Governor General. The Governor General replied,to the Director of /Posts—4— i. 1 osts and Xelegrapias,that as the postmen were Government employees a strike would be illegal,but the Director should investigate cases of hardship and report them to Tehran,asking for authority to increase _ wat.es where ne thought it v,as justified* The central administration in Tehran have apparently replied that they cannot authorize a regional increase for Azerbaijan but are willing to consider the grant of cost- of-living bonuses. The Director of rests *nd ielegraphs asked the postmen to sign the Governor General’s letter lo him in acknowledge ment that they had seen his ruling that they had not the right to strike,but the men Refused* The number of employees concerned is not more than about 80. The workers’ Union is now beginning to take a hand in the distribution of monopoly goods. A notice was posted on December 30th. informing all those who have not yet received their new ration cards that they can get them by present Lug their identity papers at the union’s office. The issue of these new ration cards has dragged out unconscionable time,and there is some excuse for exasperation at trie dilatorineas of the Finance department officials. Workers are also informed that they may obtain their ration of cigarettes from the union office. The ration is 25 packets of 10 per month,at 3 rials per packet. It is rumoured that the Azerbaijan Workers’ Union is going to change it s name • 8. Kezaieh. A meeting was held about December 26th.,1944 for the purpose of forming a local branch of the Ireedom Front. The Tudeh Party has been strong in nezaieh for some time,but until no* the Freedom Front has not existed tnere. The development is,nowever, purely nominal,all the members of the Tudeh Tarty being members of the rreedon Front and vice versa.Ansari,the editor of the newspaper rt Keivan',published in nezaieh,spoke at the meeting,and the usual telegram whs sent to Tehran. It was observed that a large number of Assyrian,nkmexiian and Muslim women attended. The editor of 'Keivan* held a party on ,,qy/ Tear’s Day to collect funds for the ned Army. It is reliably reported that the Soviet authorities have invited lo chiefs of the Shakkak tribe,from ..estern Azerbaijan,to visit Baku. They include Taha Agha,the son of the late Simqo,the son of Umar Khan, the son of Sartip Khan,and Ghatas Agha. Seven of the chiefs have arrived in Tabriz and the otners are said to be en route from Marand. 9* utner lurdish .J^faics-t. As has been mentioned in previous diaries, there is some rivalry between the principal chiefs of the Daboukri tribe inhabiting the region between kianduao and Hahabad. Ali Agha llkhani Aaaeh (Amir Asad; is jealous and suspicious of his two elder br there,Mahmud Agha and Aayazid :’-ghs. he has now learnt that the sons of these two,^asim Agha and Abdullah Agha,have been authorized by Tehran to maintain a force of fifteen horsemen to patrol the road between Aianduao and Uaqqiz. Sarhang Kemal,the Commandant of Gendarmerie in nezaieh,received instructions in this sense and went down to amir ^sad’s village near Bukan to ask his opinion about them, minir Asad as indignant. All the villages,he declared,on both sides of tnat road,were his. There nad never been an„ trouble there,but if nis nephews started patrolling it with their horsemen,there very soon would be. It is not yet known whether lasim and Abdullah have given effect to the authorization they have received. ihe two nave done quite well out of tne narvest in the Bukan district. They have acted as brokers in selling wheat to the Govern- ment,buying it at 15 0 rials per ton in Bukan and selling in Tabriz at 2900 rials.

All applications lor membersnip,however,must be submitted for approval to tne Russian authorities in *lianduao or Kszaieh. The so.ig of Mahmud Agha and Bayazid Agha ol the Deboukri tribe are said by the same Anformant to have joined the society. Ibrahim Ilkhani Zadeh also remarked that all copy for tne Kurdish magazine ’Rishtman 0 is sent to the Boviet Gonsulate-General in Tabriz,translated and edited before being taken to the Armenian Archbianop’s press to be printed. In assessing the accuracy of this information,allowance should be made for Ibrahim’s jealousy 0 f his cousins. A report has been received from Amir Asad that about December 23th or 29th.,the officer commanding Russiaxi troops at Mlanduab visited the village of Armani Bulagh,situated to the ^ast of the road between .mia?iduab and Bukan, and enquired of the Headman whether he kn.w anything of the arrival there a few days previously of a car with three British ofxice.s. The headman disclaimed any knowledge of it,out,according to Amir Asad’s son,subsequently disclosed that three British officers had visited not Araaai bulagh,but a village in the vicinity,the name of which was reported as Uchkota (possibly Chichakatu). Tne Headman said that he had feigned ignorance in orde to avoid troublesome enquiries, as the Russian commandant seemed keenly interested in the doings of these offleers,who,he said,had been re orted to have been 'asking about Russian plans in that district'. Two thousand of Bartip Hushmand's troops from Baneh under the command of Sargund Kushishi are reported to oe quartered in Sard sht for the winter. 10. rublic Security . About the new Year,there were one ot two incidents in Tabrizjwhicn seamed to presage a recurrence of the robberies and molestations by Soviet troops which have caused some alarm to the citizens of Tabriz during: the last two-, winters. On January 2nd., Barhang Varahram,the uncle of the Chief of Btaff of the Tabriz Division, was held up by two or three xvussian soldiers in one of the main streets of the town at 8 o’clock wx in the evening and relieved of his watch and 2,5 0 tomans. A niuht or tw before,© mullah in humble circumstances was stopped at the door of a mosque by Red Army men who collected from him a watch and some thirty rials in cash. It is not an uncommon thing lor private^ of the Red Arsay to beg money of Rersiana and foreigners,but on Raw Year's ,ve,the Munahi of^ the American Consulate and a friend from the Finance Department were accosted on the street oj a Boviet officer,wno appealed to their cnarity,sayingA'Tomorrow is a holiday,and I have no money'. The official of the Finance Department,fully expecting to be robbed if he refused, settled for two tomans. There nave been no further reports of highway robbery from the countjrjr districts. The season is not propitious- According to the new Commandant of Crendsmerie. a reorganization of gendarmerie posts is in progress. The smaller isolated posts are being closed and a system of operation by sections is being instituted. It will resuit,he hopes, in better discipline and greater energy in the force. 11* bULjply department . There is a good deal of dissatisfaction with the way in which Government cotton piece goods are being distributed. The ordinary citixen on going to claim his rati m is usually met with: 'Sorry,we sold out yesterday'. The reason appears to be that many of the poorer people are selling their clothing coupons to speculators, who are willing to pay 20 rials each for them, ith the co-operation of the Supply Department officials,the speculators then are able to take up most of the available stock from tne Government shops and resell it in the bazaar at a handsome profit. The controlled price of Indian cotton piece goods in the Government shops is ab ;ut 24 rials per metre, but the same stuff sells at 50 - 55 rials a metre in the bazaar. /TheI'he rudeh paper 'liharvar-i-Nov” has recently oeen exposing this /^snd. similar scandals. The profits made by Supply Department officials are no doubt highly exaggerated by the righteous and envious,but as an example of what a job in the department is supposed to be worth,it is said that one subordinate official makes 800 tomans a by malpractices. 12. boviet Commercial affa irs. The Soviet Trade Agency sold 30 tons of soft sugar during the last week it December at 67.SO rials per kilogramme. They are also reported to have sold tbout 120 tons in T e hra j i,de1iv, -ry T abriz. Recent imports from the Soviet union include 600 bales of cotton piece goods,two wagons of loaf sugar,an unknown quantity of solid paraifin,and 180 barrels of soda for soap making; (there are two large soap factories and some small cottage enterprises in Tabriz)• Three wagon-loads of crockery,possibly including the two reported in Diary No. 21 of 1944,are reported to have been despatched to Tehran. The Russians are said to be negotiating for the purchase of 900 tons of this year's crop of raisins for delivery at Sharaf-Khaneh and Gulmankhaneh. 13. o ther Comm er cial hews * There is no impurtant change in the orice of food-stuffs,except fats. Butter and ghee have advanced,the latter to 550 rials per batman of 4.6 kilogrammes. The demand for almonds from 2-ahedan for India continues, and consignments are also oeing despatcned to Kermanehah for Iraq. The latest price is 450 rials per pood of 16 kilogrammes. The lafcest price of cotton yarn is 7,400 to 7,600 rials per bale according to quality. The new glass factory (see last Diary) appears to be putting a few tea-glasees and tumblers of inferior quality on the market. 14. Tabriz Library . The committee of the municipal Library in Tabriz are anxious to extend their collection and have asked for assistance in procuring KnglisJi books* There are at present not much more than one hundred Duglish books in the library,and few of those of any importance. But there is said to be an increasing demand for go id English works* Russian and French authors are fairly well repre sented, and most of the volumes have been presented either by individuals or by the Russian and French Consulates. The library committee’s request is being referred to tne British Council,and it is hoped that they will be able to assist in procuring a few more representative works of Bngliah literature and science.

The general opinion about the German ) offensive ie that while it cannot save Germany from ultimate defeat,it y*- 111 help to postpone that defeat still further,and the news of it is eviue:itljr welcome to the profiteers. Events in Greece#being nearer at ha.xd and involving political antagonisms with which the r a brizis them selves are familiar,have aroused more comment. The Husaian-inspired press has not failed to depict the conflict as one between democratic and 'fascist” sections of tne Greek people and to accuse Great Britain of supporting the fascists against the forces of liberty.

It is not likely that they are making much headway,for there is too little ©oasaunity of interest between the pe sants and the industrial workers of the city. But there is no doubt that the party can win a certain amount of support if it takes up strongly such typical peasant grievances aa the distributioa of land snd the op, ression ol the gendarmerie.

Ardeehee hovnanaseian,the Xudeh Iran deputy for Artaeniaa and Assyrifin minorities ■ is at present touring Azerbaijan. At *4aragha on he comber lYth.,ne held a meetixig to which he invited all the h^ads of government departments,and a number of merenaata and influential people of the town. After a preamble devdted to praise of the Soviet Union as the protector of the peopled rights everywhere arid the benefactor of Iran in particular,he dealt with the oil question and Iran's foreign policy. Iraitore in the Majlis,he aeclared,were forcing Iran to follow a 'one-sided foreign policy. If the oil concession were refused to the nussi&amp;ns,then the other concession granted to “those in the South” should be cancelled, he raised the subject of provincial coiamittees,and stated j that the Xudeh xarty were determined to organize the election of a \ committee in Azerbaijan,ainee it was evident that no understanding of \Azerbaijaii*® problems could be looked for in Tehran, hot very consistently, after inveighing against tne reactionary majority in the ^ajlis,he boaeted of the power of the handful of Tudeh deputies,of whom all the rest were afraid, he held a second meeting in A&amp;raghe for the general public,and spoke on much the saiue lines. The case for the election of a provincial committee ^as stated recently in moderate terms to a reliable informant by All Aashinchi,who was originally put up by the kusaiaas as a candidate for Tabriz in the 1944 elections for the Majlis,but was subsequently dropped, he is a man in close touch with the Soviet authorities,and nas taken part in most of the Tudeh arty meetings end demonstratione of recent months* he argued, plausibly enough,that the local affairs of Azerbaijan certainly needed to ue seen to; the officials appointed by the Geatrel Government were either ; too incompetent or too corrupt to do it,and the beat safeguard was a freely elected conmitte© of citizens of all classes* It wee a perfectly lawful proposal and one in which the co-operation of tne Central Government was earnestly desired, hut,he affirmed,if the Geatral | Government withheld its approval,and other citizens abstained from jparticipating,the Tuden Tarty would nevertheless proceed with the project, and the committee would be composed entirely of members of the Tudeh ! Tarty. To far,none- of the Arrangements 1 for the election of a committee, to which tae Tudeh speakers constantly refer,has become apparent in fact. The view of the Governor- eneral of Western Azerbaijan,which might fairly be taken as representing that of the Persian local authorities,is (that tne project is so much hot air. Tom© of the merchant© and industrialist© of Tabriz,uowever,who feel the neglect of municipal affairs more than the officials axui landlords,are inclined to toy with tne idea,though there Is nothing to show that any of them is giving it axiy actual support. It is not improbable that the rudeh Party may form some body calling itself © 'Provincial Gsmmittee'*,out now far it would be used lor the purposes now urged as arguments for its formation,or what Influence it w uld have on local affairs,ia aapredictatebe. 341. u.-a .Uk ■wl.vb ulGA .ihe leader© of tne workers * Union (Uhurai Muttahldei Xyalati ivzerbsij&amp;n.j continue to make a ©how of their authority.

Towards the end of the eriod now under review it has been noticed that the Tudeh Party S 4 d the Soviet authorities anticipate that Bayat's attitude will be unacoo odating, and the ground is obviously being prepared for the exercise of the same sort of pressure against him as was used against Sa*ld. Such meetings of the Tudeh Party and the Jibhei Azsdi as have been held have been perfectly orderly, but there is a feeling among the merchants - always^extremely sensitive to threats of possible disorder - thut the end of the present w&lt;ek may see more disturbances. Clemente in the agitation that have become more noticeable in the last two weeks are hostility tow rda Beyyid Zi® - after the fall of Si^id he has be n given pride of place as the arch ’traitor’; and a widening of the scope of the agitation to include demands for adsainistr tive and agrarian reforms. 309. erslan Officials. Khalil Fahimi, I iniater without Portfolio in ^a’i&amp;’s cabinet, and in the new cabinet of Bayat, arrived in Tabriz on November ££nd., coming from Ikmeh via Hiandmib and Hezaieh. (Gee paragraph 315 below). Mohawaad 11 agsvll, the acting director of Finance, in structions for whose transfer were received some time ago, h^s now left Tabriz. The functions of Director of Finance have been as sumed by Mr. Thomas Allen, the American head or the Bunply Depart ment. 310. Tabriz Deputies. The question of the rejected Azerbaijan deputies has been Included recently in the Tudeh indictment of the Central Government, but it se ms to have been brought up not as a setter of the first importance in itself but rsther ss an addition al proof of the reactionary and undemocratic character of the present Majlis. It has been coupled by one sneaker at least with the charge that it was the ’Tehran Governiasnt’ that rigged the last elections in Azerbaijan: an accusation which indicates some con fusion or Ideas, but is interesting for its assumption as a matter of course that the ©lections were rigged by someone. ilrdashez Hovhanassi&amp;n, the tSideh deputy for Armenian and Assyrian minorities, held a public meeting in the Firdausi School on November 17th. His speech was a general att ok on the reaction aries in Tehran, and u warning tbut the new government was likely to prove as unaccepatoblo to true liberals as Sa’ld’s/ He came out strongly, of course, for the immediate gr nt of th© oil concession to Russia, but kept most of his energy for an attack on feyyid Zia, who, he insisted, should be expelled from Iran. 311. Russian Affairs . Thera ere signs that the Russian military authorities, no doubt in anticipation of tan intensifioation of the agit tion against the Persian Government, are exe cislng a s rioter control over the Persian polio© and gendarmerie. It is 3s 5 srned on fairly reliable authority that the Governor-General in Tabriz has received telegrams from the chiefs of police of tt number of towns In tne w lilrd Tstan informing him thot they have been instructed by the local Soviet military authorities to consider orders from them authorities and was told by the Governor-General that the matter was being referred to Tehran but that in the meantime he should obey the Russians. , „ 4 ’Artillery Day’ w^s celebrated by the Russian forces in n*r , /Tabriz ariBl Tabriz on Nove»b«r 19th. The oolebretion took the form of n parade cf horse-drawn and mechanized units of artillery in the .^rem , or’Hippodrome* t which wan constructed about two months * ago near the barrack* occupied by Russian force* on the Southern outskirts Ox the ci ty, Till* was fo.; lowed by a de nonstration of rarlou© artillery weapons firing at targe s on the hillsides. General ulinsky was host to a largo gathering of official*, no onl^s and ottleers of the Persian i nay, and, between bangs. explained the character!*tic* of the weapons, with suit ble i remarks «-bout the execution they hod already done* cn the German*, ^ost of the gunners did their duty efficiently by demolishing t&lt;?eir targets with the first two or three round*, but the anti- w juik gun crew* ' ight have hod an a^kuord noment if sorso unknown tact ician hi.d not stopped the advance of the dumay tanks they w f r \^Jr in « ftt befer* they actually ran thorn down. Target* on &lt;..ie hills were then attacked by bombers and fighters of the Red iir rorce, after which the company returned to the *Fi ^nodrome* end were entertained by the same display of horsemenship as had been given on the anniversary of the October Hevoution. ^he . demonstration was well planned end clearly impressed the large crov?a it attracted. The crowd, as at previous shove of this kind. mia not rer y weI l n^rshalled, and the resulting jostling and encroachments wore observed to be causing both General Glinsky and the oviet Consul-General some slight embarrassment. The Irmio- oviet Cultural ocicty held e ’Literary -vcnlng* on November S6th. to comsoorate the centenary of the death of the lussian fabulist, Krilov. Papers on Krilov’s life ana work were read by Ice; 1 members of the society in Tuvian and Turki. The official erv-ning of the new Russian school (Diary l v » paragraph 897} took place on November 17th., some time^fter attendance hed begun. The Governor-General of the Third listen .^hdi vaiv^r, made &amp; speech in which he draw attention to the * benefits conferred on Azerbaijan by the Russian* since the oc cupation, citing the soviet Hospital, the Irano- oviet Cultun 1 ociety the well recently presented to I opls of Tabriz, The oviet Consul-General, Mr, Matv ev, who followed him, spoke vmrriy of the friendly relations already existing between Iran and the covist Tnion and expressed his ccnridence th«t they would be still happier in c.ie future. ^ccor L* to Mr« Matveev three hundred chile ran attend the school. The language probie m has been solved by the division of the pupils into two sections, in one of which all instruction is in Russian, while in the other ex actly the sa/Ke subjects re taught in Turki. The text-books ior the Turki section are those used in oviet z&amp;rb&amp;ijen, printed In the Russian character. The Hues inn sponsored n 'urki newspaper ’Vat&amp;n Yolinda’ ha 3 recently boon runnings series of elementery lessons in the transliteration of Turki from the Arabic to the Cyrillic sharas ;er. It is reported that a number of citizens hsvabstitinned tne Buss ism Cossmsndant to allow Soviet military engheers to sink more wells - one in e ch quarter of Tabriz. Tudeh Agitation apd the Oil uestioja . A feature of the recent speeches mads by members 'g¥ the ll^udeh Party end the Jibhei *zadi on tb.a oil concession has been that the oil Question is nov lumped in with a Isng hsniag list 02 ’ other grievances and accusations against the Central Govsrament. It would seem th^t the speakers are treating the grant of the conoesGion a* only a P^rt, or a necessary consequence, of a wide programme of ad- tive and social reform, calling among other thing* for the establishment of freely elected town end provincial councils and the transfer of the great &gt;rietors f l&amp;nd to the peasants. The meeting held by rdashsz Hovhanassian was followed by another on November 18th., which wr s addressed by the workers’ leader, Birya, and by Habib . ghazadeh, formerly editor of the newspaper ’Shahin* which ce&amp;sed publication about six months ago. Birya harangued the crowd in his usual flamboyant style, declaring e are inspired by the spirit of our great ancestor, Nadir * hah, and we will pursue the enemy even unto Ia&lt;ii&amp; n . He did not define ’enemy’• Fiwe resolutions were passed and embodied la a /telegramf-\ telocrram which was sent to the chah and the Majlis; 1) the new oaoinet irrust be composed or liberals and honest men who will repair the errors of the late government; g) 3a f ld and his colleagues must be brought to justice; 3) Seyyid 2ie rmist be expelled from Iran; 4) town and provincial councils must be established, as provided for in the constitution; 5) Iff no reply i© received to these demands the people of Aserbsijaa will consider themselves free to t et us they think best* Birya sooka again on November £.4th. to a meeting in the Citadel Garden. He was seconded by Akhundov, one of the leaders of the « oncers* ^ion {3hurai uttahidai lyal&amp;ti A?:erb8l jsn) f and by a less ^ell known orator named fedagan. f Ilie speeches followed thef ami liar pattern of en attack: on the reactionaries at Tehran and on &gt;eyyid £ia, with a demand that the oil concession be granted to Hussia at once. Among the persons singled out for individual attack, bos ides Sayat and his ministers, were the 1‘t© oomrysncli nt of the Third (Tabriz) division, hartip Khosrovani, and Khalil lahiiai. Fahimi was at one time Governor-General in Tabriz, endit would appear that the local Todeh leaders interpret his staying here for a few days on his way back to Tehran as bein^ for 4 purposes hostile to them. They demand that he be told to le^vc the town at once. Some of the attack fell also on Fahimi’s host in Tabriz, Doctor Kizishgepour, *m old gossip, who, ou side his professional activities at any ri te, is not very dangerous to anyone. A third meeting, also ad reaped by Birya, was held on November £7th. in th© premises of the orkers* Union. Again Fahimi mis attacked, a number of alleged misdeeds during his Governor-Genereiahir being raked up against him. On November 28th. the Tudeh Party issued c notice cd&amp;rccsed to *a 11 Peasants, orkers, Liberals and nlightened People*, san©uneing,after a prefatory condemnation of the Gov ernment , that a monster meeting would be held on the 18th of Azar (December 1st), for the nuroos© of setting up councils or oomrittees (.Injuman) in the towns and villages to k^ep a vetch on the Government *s actions and prevent the execution of measures contrary to the interests of the peasants and workers of izerbei- jtm. 'here is good reason to believe that Russian army lorries ere being despatched to villages in the direction ofAsarshahr, Maraud and other p&amp;rts to ^briag in peasants to attend the mooting. It is said that villagers are being induced to come into Tabriz by a promise that piece goods and sugar will be distributed to them. While the real purpose of th© me ting is to make a show of popul r support for th© grant of th© oil concession, the Tudeh leaders are not emphasising this in their campaign to secure attendance, but ©re trying to interest the peasants by talking about dispossessing th© landlords. The country people’s indifference to the oil question Is only matched by their ignor ance of whet it involves. An informant recently arrived from the country told of one peasant who, when urged by a Tudeh party member to go to Tabriz for the ’oil business’, replied;”011? I buy my oil at the shop in our village*. 4 ^ 313. Tabriz resa . Hussein Gull Katibi, th© editor of the news paper ’Feriyad’ (Diary No.18, paragraph 285) who was arrested and interned by the Soviet authorities about a ye*r ago, and who, since his return to Tabriz, has been eagerly ae king reconciliat ion with the Russians and with the Tudeh Party, now rivals the ’Kharvar-i-Nov* in th© vigour of Ma curoort for the Russian demand and in the vehemence of hie attacks on th© Tehran ’re actionaries’. ’Khervar-i-Nov* iself (edited by ! hhraud Turcbi) has lately shown a certain restraint; it printed the names of the ministers in Bayet’s cabinet without comment, and in mentioning Fahii’s arrival in Tabriz gave him his rrop r title of respect. The Bezaieh newspaper ’Kelvea* has also come out strongly for the Hussions and eg©!net th® new Government, but it may be recalled that when H.'M. Consul-General was in Rexel eh in Dept ember, the editor took th© opportunity to explain that not too much attention should be paid to his editorial oolicy, es he ©imply wrote whet he was told. Hussein Tabriz! Fishakgi, the editor of the recently /revivedreviTad paper *T«brls(*, is baiag attacked as a suoaorter of '’ayyic rifrzaleha iiarhfca^ Bur^klisliajii # who, in addition to his post as Conrmndant ot the Tabriz Division, still retains th t of Governor-General of the fourth Dstan, returned froas his visit to astern i-zerbaijsn on November 13th. The fight between two sections of the Jelali Kurds near Mftku, mentioned in the lest Diary, was apparently a purely uri- v te and 1 o 1 affair and secaiis to have h^d no important con sequences. It was probably an episode in a long-standing intern al qusrrel among the Jelalis of ?aku, arising out of the mis- appropriatioa by certain chiefs of a eum of 30,000 tomens granted to the tribe by the Central Government for the relief of distress about four years ago. /nothcr incident is reported to have taken place in the second week in November in the Som&amp;i-Baradost district. Hassan Tilo, a chieftain of the fhakkak, paid: a visit to Hezaieh. f/hll he w^s there a rival chieftain laid an ambush on the road back to his village and atched for his return. It appears that Hassftn Tilo sent Pis people on ahead while he stayed a little longer by himself in Rezaieh. His men fell into the ambush *nd there were some casualties. Hasaan Tilo on hearing the news hurried back to his v 1 I' ; ge,arxklaxratarax. raised ilia people and promptly sought revenge on his enemy. It is understood that the difference wes eventually composed by the intervention of a Russian officer. The foviet authorities h^ve caused the expulsion from Resaieli of certain undesirable residents: Hajji Mirza Ghulam, herd of the local charity organization and a member of the Tudeh party, Mirza li skar a mullah, Ibrahim 'amsami a lawyer, and a certain Ahmed Riaidi. The grounds of the Soviet authorities’ objection to these people are not known. . coording to Khalil iahlal the Herki bandit, Zero Bag, ’Aho usually lives in the village of Kukia, near IRezaieh, shifted his camp to the 3«rda*ht region about the time of the occupation of Baneh in order to act a® a liaison between Hama Rashid and the Soviet authorities. He is said to have explained, while disarmlag a couple of gendarmes on the Sardssht-Baneh road, that ho was not doing so for his own pleasure or profit, but thrt he was obliged to keep the road clear of gendarmes for other ends. :• Rher Kurdish kf fairs. The general impression that Khalil Fahlml has geined from his stay in Baneh is, first,that there is little serious support among the tribesmen for the idea of an independent Kurdistan, and sscond, that Hama Rashid for feited his chance of winning any general sympathy among the Kurds by his brutality st Herivan and hi© burning of Bench. Fahimi appears to have be n impressed by the genuineness of the a a- suxaness of loyalty he received from chieftains everywhere he passed. r *e that none of them seriously believed th t • the Kurds would be able to maintain an independent state: they assumed th t a united iCurdieton would neoeasarily be under the domination of one of the three powers who now divide Kurdish territory among them, and the Kurds of Iran sew no advantage in exchanging government by Iranians for government by Arabs or Turks. They aofcaowi^^ed &gt;^i*t Russia might h^ve a certain interest in encouraging the idee of Kurdish independence, but said they realized that Russian support would not be ^iven out of pure affection for the Kurds. Fahimi was headed a memorandum drawn up by the J.K. Society in which they said that they were willing to leave the political st' tue of the Kurds to be settled at the }eace Con ference and all they asked for now was th© recognition of Kurd ish as the official language to be used in administyation and in the schools. Fahimi replied that as they were willing to leave so much to the Peace Conference they might as well leive the question of the Kurdish Ifsnguage to be settled then with the rest. Fahimi himself see© the solution of the Kurdish problem in an extension of efficient government and social services - /schools- 8 - and hospitals - to the trlbel ere, s. At ^reseat all th tribesmen ever see of the Irsaian Government la the 'endawiwle and military. me lirst essential is to select a body of honest and symrtithetio civil ofricials: it is hopaln., to try ?r govern the nU:ds through soldiers.

The teohaioal manager or the Khosrovi Leather factory declare* that his factory has rioney to pay the workers only up to Next :^arch. Part of the difficulty is the swarm of unwanted and useless men whom the manager is obliged to employ at the request of the Governor-General, the Formandar, the Chief of 'Police and oth^r influential persons. The Directors * plan is to close down in March for an overhaul of machinery, discharging all hands with the three months wages payable under the Sheikh award, and then three months later, to reopen with about one hundred h^nds, who are all th t ere needed at the present rate of produce! *;n. But it is doubtful whether such &amp; plen will succ eed against the workers f opposition. The Iran Leather Factory is thought not to have funds to carry on beyond the end of next Janu* ry, andlthree other factories in the town have not paid their workers for the 1 st fortnight. 319. ^oserlo an ..jr oroe her eonnel. The e v 1 cunt ion of American Army lir roroe men ant! material from. Russia through Tabric is now complete. The camp was closed and all personnel moved south on November 30th. The sojourn of the ymericana in Tabriz has not been without its ef ’cot on the life of the town. Tie interest of the men centered chiefly on the Cafe Pars, not altogether to the proprietor’s aatlafaotloa^ aa their behaviour caused his regul r customers to desert the $lace. The principal causes of trouble w^re vodka and the , merio&amp;n’s craving for f■ 1 society. Ir^atlafyiag the latter he failed to grasp the difference in the wa^y matters are managed in a country where society is largely influenced by the customs of Islam. The dif ference led to a brawl at the Cafe Pare on the night of November 27th. in which one American soldier was stabbed and seriously wounded by a loo&amp;l bravo. Another incident arising out of the Americans’stay here either shows that in the Tabriz! mind the affairs of the t^o Anglo-Setacon Democracies are even mov&amp; mixed up than Mr. Churchill said they would be, or else throws into flattering relief the British reputation tor se In* Justice done. A lady of the town had the ill-luck to entertain an American soldier who not only scented payment for the services rendered but helped himself when depr rtlng to the lady’s watch. Before noon the next day she was appealing for restitution of her property not to the American Camp Commandant, nor to the American Consul, but to the Bri11sh Consulste-Cenero1• jr. . ell. British Consulate-General, Acting Consul-General. Tabriz. November 30th., 1944.them, irom noon to four o’clock there was a cavalry dlsnlay fiven by officers and men of the Ked j *my. In spite of the fact that it was the coldest and wettest day that Tabriz had so far had this winter, the townspeople turned un in large numbers, many bodies such as factory workers and school children, marching to the ground in procession with variously inscribed, banners* The attendance included a considerable number of other rants of the Persian army y\* ho f a» though to show that there was no ill-feeling over the * iit/tl© differences of the previous week, were given ring-side positions and were refreshed with tea end sw ets in the 'interval. General Glinsky presided over the display and entertained the Governor General, Sarhang hurakhshani, some other officials and the Consular thorps at wnet he called soldier’s luncheon’ — consisting of a few tins of sardines and bits of cheese and an intolerable deal of vodka. Under the influence of General Glinsky’s irresistible hospitality allied solidarity was enthusiastically acclaimed ano. the spirit of the day overcame linguistic barriers even so far as to evoke from the usually circumspect Iraqi Consul a remarkable and convivial flow of what he said was Ihissian. In the evening the soviet Consul-General held a rec- ection at his summer residence in the suburb of Maralan, and the day was rounded off by a torchlight procession of Red Army men through the main streets of the tow n. On November 11th. the Armenian colony held a soiree in aid of a fund to provide tanks for General Bagramian. Tickets were sold at IDO tomans each. The soiree was very poorly attended Tor the people of Tabriz are becoming a little weary of these 9 constant ammands on their pockets. It was observed in particular that the Armenian colony itself was very slightly represented. The Governor-General made a short speech - inaudible, as usual; and General Gxinsky snoke on General Bagramian 1 s character and career. A photograph of Bagramian in a silver frame ornamented with en gravings ot Alexander and other wor thi es was sold by American auction for a sum of over SO’O tomans. * tfhil© it is true that there is more criticism of Russian methods in private, at such functions us these there is no diminut ion of the enthusiastic applause v/ith which every reference to the Soviet Union and the Red Army is greeted. The Persian officials miss no opportunity of bringing their pro-soviet ardour to the notice of Soviet officials - even at the risk of overdoing it a little. Mr. Yaoouboff, counsellor of the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, is visiting Tabriz. He arrived in time for the Revolution anniver sary celebrations and was observed at Geberal Glinsky’s luncheon party to be interpreting between the General and the Governor- General, very fluently, but with less success than he might have had if he had not used the Turk! language with which the Governor- Genoral is not acquainted. On November 16th. the Irano-Aoviet Cultural Society held an exhibition of photographs illustrating ’Hitler’s Kgw Order’, in the premises in the Municipal Garden which the Society has recently taken over. After the photographs had been viewed the Society'’s new cinema, in the same building, was officially opened by the Governor-General in hie capacity as joint chairman of the Society. Five or six speeches, all practically identical, were made in Persiar Turk! and Russian by Iranian and Russian members of the society, including Yaadan Farr, the head of the Tabriz Education Department. The speeches stressed the role played by the Soviet Union, not only as the saviour of world freedom, but also as the guardian of world culture as represented bv Shakespeare, Pushkin, Tolstoi, Firdausi and Saadi (in that order). Goethe end Dante were not placed. Several young men, members of the Society and of the Tudeh Party, distributed at the exhibition leaflets in Persian joyfully announcing the fall of Sa’id’s cabinet and calling on the'Shah and Majlis not to accept any new Government other than one which will reverse Sa’d’s policy and immediately take steps -among them the granting of the oil concession to Soviet Russia - to bring about the closest possible political and economic co-operation with Iran’s great and friendly Northern neighbour. The leaflet, which is signed ’On behalf of all the different classes of the people of Azerbaijan’ / ends-3 ends with an exhortation to &amp;eraand the punishment of Sa’id and his associates, MushaPj i.iururi # 2*8TinK.Qfsh and Kazitni| and the expulsion from Iran of Seyyid Zia ud Din. The well which Russian engineers have been sinking in the Municipal Garden was finished before November 7th. It was formally presented to the people of Tabriz on that day to mark the anniversary of the Revolution and as a token of the friendship between the ^r^nisn and Soviet peoples. It is said to be over 150 metres deep „.nd to give about 3,000 litres of water aday. The new Russian school, mentioned in ^iary No.17, paragraph 271, is now open for the attendance of children up to the fourth class. 298. Oil Concession. Demonstrations and meetings organized by the Tudeh Party and The Jibhei ^zadi continued up to November 7th. On that daythe news was received in Tabriz that the Soviet Govern ment had agreed to the postponement of the question of oil concess ions until after the war. The agitation ceased almost at once. A crowd which had as ambled, as on every day of the preceding week, before the Municipal offices, w's addressed by Birya, who thanked them for their past efforts and told them that there was now no further need for their services, as the matter * had been settled in Tehran’. Their day was not spoilt, however, for there were plenty or processions forming up in honour of the October xievolu^ion, and it was only a question of getting a different set of banners. The last days of the agitation h«d been quite orderly. The Tudeh Party had appointed their own special constables who kept order at the meetings and patrolled the bazaar wearing brassards with the words * Mamur Intizamat Tudeh* on them. There is little doubt that the action of the Soviet authorities in disarming the Persian police and army officers, however deplorable it may have been from the point of view of the prestige of the Persian administration, did at least serve the practical end of averting further bloodshed. Experience ha^a shown that guns in the hands of the Persian police will go off, and another corpse or- two would not have eased the situation. The Soviet authorities no doubt felt that there was never any danger of the demonstrators, for their part, exceeding a certain degree of violence. The police and army officers h ve now received their arms back. ^ J .. . r ^ It is naturally not possible to ascertain the exact extent or ■ Soviet instigation of the agitetion: there ere numerous stories whose chief importance is that they show how wide a field it was attempted to cover in seeking support for the Russian demand. example, a Tabriz doctor says that he was asked by the -evict General to call the members of his profes ion together anu send an agreed telegram to the Government demanding compliance with tna Russian request in the interests of the poor of Azerbaijan, ke avcrs that he did invite a number of his colleagues to his house, but addressed them in such a way as to lead them to turn ^ ^oposoI down, whereupon he virtuously reported to the soviet uonsul-Gener&amp;l that he had done his best, but he feared the profession didn t really care about the poor of Azerbaijan. Another report is that about 70 of the retail sellers o* kerosene in Tabriz were assembled by one of t ^® ir nu ® b an * and taken to the Soviet Consulate-General on the pretext thet some more advantageous conditions for the sale of T® t ! r ! be announced to them. When they got there eight before viewed by Kassan Hassanov, the Caucasian Vice-Consul, w..o laid befor them the text of a telegram which he asked them to sign. ^1 oun one excuse or another for refusing. ^ ^ Again, Ibrahim Ilkhan.h -adeh reports that he was ^ K ^ oy Hassan Haesanov to ask his rather, Amir Asad, to persuade the Kurdish chiefs of Bukan to send a joint telegram. Enquiry into the shooting on October 30th. ’”^ e “ °“ e killed and another wounded (Diary Ko.lB, paragraph 288 ) does not seem to have been prosecuted with vigour or ‘ Q isgi _ definite conclusion. On November 6th. it a / t on from Tehran had arrived here, composed ® r ‘-- a ]*ang Narzan. ( time chief of the Divisional Staff -’Rais-l-otad - * * . Sarhang ,.zad Tegzana, Aarhang Mazhari, who has he y„ 8briz4- Tabriz and Resbt, and Doctor Pad p of the Ministry of Justice, whose task was to investigate the disturbances. They left again on or about November 14th. without disolosim; here the results of their investigation. It was popularly supposed in the town that they had made themselves obnoxious to the c oviet authorities, particuk rly by talking of the Russians having 1 submitted * to the Persian Govern ment’s will in the oil question, and had been asked to cut short their stay. 299. Yestern Azerbaijan. Apart from a little feeble agitation by Tudeh members in connection with the oil question, Rezaieh has remained quiet during the period under review. About the 7th or 8th. of November there was a fight between two sections of the Jelali Kurds near Paku, in which, according to the Governor-General at Tabriz, twenty men were killed. The figure is probably much exaggerated. Sarhang Durakhsheni, in command of Persian troops at Tabriz, left for Rezaieh on November 11th. on his way to iWaku. 300. Other Blurdish Affairs . Un November 14th. the Turkish Consul- Genoral in Tabriz received^through the post a circular in Kurdish which he believes to have emanated from the J.K. Society and to have been printed in Mahabad. No other foreign consul hes received the circular, and up to the time of writing, the Turkish Consul- General, not having had a translation m de, is unable to say what its purport is. 301. Labour Situation . A new workers’ organization has appeared during the lest month. It is called the Provincial Union of Workers and Peasants of Azerbaijan -♦Ittihadiyei xyalati Kargeran wa Barzagaran .Azerbaijan’, and is led by a certain Reza Simrud who seems to have no other claim to local fame. In a letter to the head of the Tabriz Chamber of Industry Simrud declares that his Union is not associated with any other party and that its sole aim is to fight for better economic conditions. There is news of the formation of a commission to gojt to Tehran to report on the state of Tabriz industries: its members will be All Akbar 3adagiani, President of the Tabriz Chamber of Commerce, All Akbar Baftei, manager of the Iran Leather Factory, Abdul Aziz Kalantari, the heed of the Chamber of Industry, and Karim Mubassir Roshanl, the Farmandar of Tabriz. Kalantari's view is that the industrial situation, while bad enough, is not quite so desperate as the factory owners make out. He contends, for instance, that the Calouttachi Textile Factory, which has been threatening to close down for months past on the grounds that it is running at a loss, is still making a thirty per cent nrofit. Ahat the owners call their losses, is, in fact, simply a reduction of the excessive profits they used to make. The Tabriz workers meanwhile are apprehensive that the new labour legislation, if it is passed, will work largely in fevour of the owners (in comparison with the local agreement) and will deprive them in particular of the grants of free bread, charcoal and clothing which they enjoy under the present scheme. 302. Azerbaijan Grain . According to the Director of Agriculture, I small Bazurgani, this years harvest will be the best that Azerbaijan has known for many years. The exact figure is not yet known, but he estimates that it will be from 5 to 10 per cent more than last year’s which was 600,000 tons. The acreage sown with wheat this winter will be less than last yerr, the reasons being, first, that the farmers are disappoints at the fall in price*, and, second, the lateness of the rains. Only in the Ardebil, Moghan and Kara Dagh regions has there been suf icien rain when it was wanted. In the rest of Azerbaijan if the rain comes now it will be too late to do much good as the cold weather has set in. Everyone is anxious to sell whest to the Government whose prices remain well above those of the open market. The Russian military authorities are buying only sufficient barley for the needs of their cavalry stationed in the province. In Ardebil the Supply . /t*! m n t\ ml i i ini--5- Department is trying to sell a surplus quantity of barley wbioh it purchased last year and is finding no takers at the price of 600 rials a ton, A joint Russian and Iranian arfI\t-locust expedition is working in the Moghan steppe, where agg-laying has been wide.spread. The area affected is some 400,000 hectares. _;303. Supply Depart? .ent. The long drawn out struggle between Mr, Heft, the American head of the Department and his Iranian col leagues of the Ministry of Finance still goes on, Mr. Allen succeeded in securing the dismissal of Mohammed All Agevli, the acting Director of Finance, but the latter managed to get hold of the letter from Tehran containing his dismissal first, and suppressed it for several weeks. When Mr. Allen at last dragged it into the light of day ^gevli, defeated but not discouraged, wrote off to the Ministry asking for a reconsideration of the case. The Iran ian officials of the Finance Department complain that Mr. Allen’s regular overriding of them is not in line with the methods agreed upon between Dr. Millspaugh and the Minister of Finance. Meanwhile, in spite of Mr. Allen’s vigilance, there are sign* from time to time that minor officials do manage to run the department on traditional lines: Jehangiri, the official in charge of the distribution of piece goods and sugar, recently collaborated with another employee of the department, a Kurd from Mah&amp;bad named Ja’afari, to divert to their own use 300 tons of sugar which they seem to have obtained by the simple ruse of representing that it was the allocation for the tribes of Sardasht. The distribution of ration cards goes on very slowly. Mr. Allen has issued notices asking the people to be patient and as suring them that there is enough sugar and cloth to go round. The issue of cards was stopped altOvgether for two days about November 10th. because of the discovery of e fraud by which certain persons were pbtaining identity cards from ftiends and relatives in out lying villages and presenting them to the registration centres in the town as evidence of the size of their own families. In the past, foreign consulates in Tabriz were able to buy an unlimited quantity of sugar from the Supply Department at the controlled price of 20 rials per kilogramme.(The open market price is 70 -80 rials). Mr. Allen thinks this privilege has been abused and has now reorganized the system on a man-kilogramme basis:- each member of a consulate staff is to receive three kilogrammes per month. The chief sufferer by this reform will be the Iraqi Consul who, with an establishment of four persons, has regularly bought 50 kilogrammes a month in the past. Soviet Commercial Affair s. The Soviet Trade Agency is showing a little more activity. During the week ending on November 11th. they sold to local merchants twenty tons of soft sugar at Bis.70 per kilo. They have also sold 20 bales of cotton piece goods at Bis. 40 per metre. (The controlled price of Government rationed piece goods is Hls.35). Two or three months ago the Russians sold piece goods to local merchants at His.70. Through these sales and a loan of 5 million rials which the Russian Bank has obtained from the Tabriz branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran, the Russians are somewhat more flush of local currency than they were a month or so ago. They have taken up and paid for 30 wagon loads of raisins from Maragha which they con racted for lest year. They are also buying live-stock for their meat canning factory which resumed operations about November 12th. 305. Other Commercial News . The beginning of November saw a sudden rush by loca1 merchi nts to remit money to Tehran. Some were sending by drafts and telegraphic transfers as much as a million rials at a time. This is some indication of the view taken by the merchant class of the state of security here at that time. The flow has slackened a good deal since the collapse of the Fudeh agitation. The Banque Mellie continues to suffer from e shortage of cash. Only five million of the ten million rials borrowed from the Imperial Bank were repaid in cash here, the balance ?fas transfer red in Tehran. The Supply Department is one of those affected by /ther / n O J4r* All^n h^s a«^&lt;5 f^o» tl## to or tin ~ * — the lienque MelXie , i# time of mmm of o^«h varying from oa« or two to etidit ®iIiioii risia to f ia&amp;ftoa j?re to ouroha^ea and he h»^»- -ha^-a'ho tiiud iritis dirrlaulty in obt,inin« the*.

Q44 Tsbri*. o^/goi/ - 8 / 44 ) Gotob^r 5th. 1944. iir # I hsiv© the honour to reoort that, acoompr-niftd by my kunshi, Mr. FarbusU, I have juat (jonroleted a fiY© day tour of Western ^^rbaijan in th© oourae of which I visited Khoi f Hezaioh end Mahebad. g. I found that a new Feraeader had been inat lied at Khoi since my last visit. He is leroail Navvab, who wae born in Bafhd&amp;d and -ae for mn ny y©f?.rs t he told me, employed by the Iraq police. Before coming to Khoi he was serving in the ^outh, in Bushire and elsewhore. My opportunities of con versation with him and other officials were limited os shortly before reaching Khoi we had ricked up a badly shaken laspoetor of Justice from an overturned oar. Inte ©st beeaise, therefore, concentrated in his highly coloured and entirely untruthful story of how the accident oceu red and in making arrangements for ih© salvaging of the vehicle by prison labour, but I subsequently learned that the Governor-Ganeral is satisfied with the way the new Far uadar is performing his duties, especially in maintaining good relations with the Russians. The Faimndar, however, in a conversation with a reliable infomant, has confessed to the difficulty attending those relations and complained of a lack of reciprocity ®s, while doing ©vex'ythlng ooaaible to iseet their wishes, it ie N difficult to get corresponding help from them. I believe the real position to be that while the Soviet Consul at I'aku, whoa© ?district includes Khoi, is amenable to reason, the foviet jmilitary authorities are not entirely accommodating. The latter authorities arc also known to be infinitely suspicious of any foreigners visiting the area, a Soviet officer explain ing to the Farmnndar that the long and 0 reful scrutiny mde of the credentials of Persian officers passing through Fhoi was due to the risk that some enemy m ight be masquerading in Persian uniform. hen it pothTIfd out to him that the Germans were equally Persian enemies end could not obtain f Persian documents, the officer said he was not thinking of Germans but of This story was told by the ? ; arman- t dar to the sttraa’inforisant. 3. On the Journey to Heaaieh we were able to give a lift to the head of the Kezaieh municipality v who had been left stranded at Khoi by the driver of a hired oar, who, fearing the confiscation of his vehicle by the Russians as he was ualrr stqlon lonh—lease tyres, r d fled in the nipht• &gt; \ Sezsieh I was again the guest of the French Catholic Mission, and the extensive local knowledge of its superior, bather Frmassan, end th© other priests formed a valuable background for aopraiain* the general situation. In their conoany I also made three excursions into the surrounding country-side to enable roe to get a clearer picture of the tangled skein of races whose animosities form the permanent pattern of life in this district. As usual, l‘*avim out of account the Kurds, it is the Assyrian minority which is the most restless and lends itself most easily to leftish, pro-Russian movements such as Tuden Iran. ‘These Catholic priests, ^hose flock is sUiost •xclusively recruited from the Chaldea A^rian^ H.K.Imba© dor, British %bassy, Tehran.element, told m of their dif ioulty in restraining the hot-heads from nfrticinatlag In polities and ar© still full of fears for tha sttieiy of the Assyrian element *?hoa th© f osle?a8 can a&amp;ain tyire free rein to their pent-up fanatioian* 4 # X Min able to hare tro long oonversatloaa with the \aoYernor-Oeneral, Ssrlmug All Akbsr Durakhshoni, who, during the two monthe he hae hoen at Reeaieh has d ne naach towards re st blisMag general oonfidenca after the disorde s of last July and in making the Kurds and other elecaemte unders and that the 'orsian authorities are still a factor to be reckoned with. Although a soldier, he is averse to the use of fores where it can possibly be avoided and considers that even with the sm&amp;ll force at his disposal he can mi :tain order now and on the withdrawal of the soviet troops# un this latter point he may b® soraewhat too optimistic, but ha© general ideas on the handling of the situation are undoubtedly sound* He realised on his arrival that the Kurds and other Maori ties thought that the authority of the Persian Government had virtually ceased to exist and that they were destined to become Soviet citizens* He has already had some success in mking them understand that tho MoAioaA^flj.1 go and the Persians will regain and that iin^e meantime internal affairs are primarily his concern* One oroof of the changed attitude of the Kurds is that they no longer queue up at the Soviet Consulate *lth their grievance* 9 but come to the Governorate and many Kurd ish chiefs h^ve spontaneously expressed their fidelity to the Iranian Government. Sarhaag Burakhshani is even confident that he could disarm the Kurds without bloodsiied if permitted to remain in Heealeh* Thera seems coneiderfible doubt, however, as to the length of his stay, there being © strong rurour that he is unlike ly to return from a. visit ha is shortly to o«y to Tehran. Hie removal would, in ary opinion, be a misfortune, particularly if it meant a reversion to e venal off icial, aaxlotl* to make personal &amp;***» ^1* ohler eim. Both the Persians and the Kurds with whom I eooke had a good word to say for the present Govarnor-Ck-neral, although H . Belikov of the Soviet Consulate is reported to have said that he was running so fast that he would soon reach the end* In point of f«ot, however, Sarhang iurakhshani has also tangible successes to show in kia relations with the Soviet authorities. 5* The Gove nor-General had just returned from the second visit he ted paid to Mahabad, where he ha d gone, on last notions from Tehran, to repair the Mischief onased by the unauthorized incursion of Sartip HuahJ^md, oosssander of the troops in Kurdistan into a district which wjis not hi* own* This general was already hated in Mahabed and his threats of violence ©gainst th© loc f 1 Kurdish chiefs had threatened to disturb the tranquillity of that district* The Governor-General smoke vary warmly of the ^etebad Kurds, drawing a sharp diatincion between their settled, orderly existence and the turbulence of the Jelsli, Sh&amp;kkftk and part of * the Herki tribes to the Morth. He even had s good word for Gazl S^hnmrd, who had professed that h© was a loyal Persian subject and denied the extremist ideas attributed to him. He feund the ^angour tribe in a st t© of crnaic:*rable poverty, which he took to bo the cause of the unrest amongst thea, and decided that as soon as ever possible they and the other tribes should receive the rationed goods to which they were eiititled. He likewise formed no bad opinion of the various tribal chiefs, again comparing very favourably tbeir tribal administration with that of the chiefs of the northerly tribes just mentioned* The Governor-General does not believe in the likelihood of the Hahabad Ku ds joining in any movement against the Persian Government with the Bansh or Hezaleh Kurds as he considers they have few ideas or interests in oonmon. 1 do not myself consider, however, that he is necessarily ri ht as regards ths la ck of tie© between the Baneh and Mahabad Kurds: both are slike very sensitive to any suggestion of the re-intro duction of e repressive Persian regime threatening alike their possessions and liberty. Cn© thing tbnt dls^le? sed Sarhang Durekhshani in ^.shebad was the ineffectiveness of the Fermandar, whom he found In almost complete ignornnoe of what wea afoot..r&gt; bt.lo / if to Pro «* ,3 w herofore aaked Tehran to renl« ca him. C. darheog Duralchehani admitted th^t he had not he^n entirely »nc^easful in dealing with ^ero Sti? and his t3 ferki follov^era In the Bar ndo* district.

The present Soviet Consul, he said, had expres ed himself Bt^oafly *;n the subject and urged him frequent ly to deal with it energetically.

The Oovernor-Ouneral had many hard words for the Kurdish tribes between Keneien end the 'Russian frontier, particularly for the Jelali. He attributes all the blame, however, to their chiefs and regard* the tribesmen as th© defenceless vieUra or a system wher fey they fre sent out to rob rnd get kill'd or, if euocessful, to pert with the booty to their chiefs. For this reason he regards the chiefs as generally unpopular with their * trifeee.

There is likewise a crying need for more doctors, as the one young, inexperienced doctor is entixely Incapable of c ring i or the sick in the town and dietriet.

Kurdlsh-Ruaal &amp;n He la M ona • ! 1944 -4* -^ryt^^rrrKr^im I recently travelled through part of Azerbaijan and Kurdistan, going from Tabriz to Eermanabah via Miyanduab, Mah&amp;bad, Saqqiz and Sanandaj. The dividing line between the 'Persian* and 'Russian' zones was some where between ^iyanduab and Saqqiz* The last Russian military control post was in Miyanduab; Persian soldiers, gendarmerie and police were in evidence in Saqqlz* In the Russian area from ourside Tabriz up to and including ^iyanduab and Mahabad the towns and villages were full of heavily armed Kurds. I saw no Persian police or gendarmerie. The few Kurds I talked to in this area, all spoke of Kurdish independence with enthusiasm. One, a merchant in /VJiyanduab whose real interests can hardly have lain in an independent Kurdistan, said an independent Kurdistan, however poor, and whatever sacrifices its establishment would involve, would be better than the present situation. Such an independent Kurdistan would, of course, he said, require advisers for finance and other matters. In Mahabad Qazl Muhammad, a local Kurd, brother of the deputy for that area, appeared to be the chief local power. My impression was that he was working in close contact with the Russians*, and doing what he could to undermine the influence and authority of the Persian officials. There were rumours of secret meetings of Kurdish chieftains under his leadership. He openly spoie of having succeeded in getting rid of Colonel Hushmand who had been sent to Mahabad to establish a garrison there by the Iranian Government. (Hushmand incidentally had been in R&amp;habad during the time of Reza Shah and seemed to have a bad reputation, though whether this was put about by his enemies or not, I oannot say). A Kurdish newspaper, alleged to be printed secretly, is published. Qazl Muhammad had some share in its publication. It supported, so he said, Kurdish independence. It seemed to contain articles on comimmlsm also. lira.

Gp|&amp;85the Governor-General received a telegram from the Vinieter oi‘ Justice saying thnt It was to be nostooned and the dossier of the case forwarded to Tehran. The next morning he also hsd a telephone call from the soviet Consul-General enquiring whether these instruct ions had been duly received and insisting that the dossier must be sent to Tehran. There was no desire, he ad ed, on the oart of the Soviet authorities to interfere with the c/ourae of justice, but -they wished the case to be reviewed. According to the Governor- general he retorted that the Soviet authorities were doing just the same sort of thing as the Tsarist regime end protecting the worst elements of the population, which, would result in their earning the same popular detestation. The Russian censor employed in the Tabriz post office has been making detailed enquiries about the postal and telegraph organization in Azerbaijan. It is worthy of special note that Mr. S. HarcnenRoj the Soviet Vice-Consul, whose reputation as the principal Joviet trouble maker w ; s abundantly justified, has batn transferred to Moscow# 2Z9. Rezaieh. The attempt of the Governor-General to extend his authority over the Herkl tribe has been me-ting with further re sistance*. Although authentic details of actual events are lacking it appears that £ero Beg attempted to rally the tarnish, Bagzadas, Iraq Herkl* and other tribes to his support and that a powwow of these tribes took place in Margivar. The first reports were alarmist and spoke of the possibility of a ol*hh of lerge numbers of trioes- men with the Persian troops, but in the event the tribes dispersed peacefully following negotiations with Sarhang Kemal, heed of the Rezaiah gendarmerie, in which h© i® said to have enjoyed th® deciding, influence of Soviet support. Th© situation round Bezaieh 1® now quiet and the harvesting of crops in the neighbourhood is proceeding normally. ^40. Other Kurdish Affairs. A Kurdish informant from 1'ahabnc has stated that the SurdTsh Independence movement continues to grow and that special af arts are being made to eiiliat young men. It is also extending to the tribes and several members of the Mamish tribe have Joined. The same source says that in all five numbers of the •Nishtraen 1 have now been published. It is reason bly clear that the Russians are in touch with the Movement, though what degree of support they are lending is not clear beyond helping with the print ing of the paper just mentioned. , . .. The s me movement has just been ett eked in an article in tne Re?.aieh paper , K©ivftn , • It states that certain mysterious anu unclean hands in Mahabad (i.e. Gazi Mohammed in particular) are working for H it. forgetting that Mahabad, -ardasht, etc., cannot be senar from Iran ns tliey have always been Persian territory T* 1 * article Points to tbe neglect of Mahabad by the Iranian Goyernerat. The opium-smoking Farmandar and the futile head of Police should, tne writer says, be replaced by energetic officials able to curb »ne nefarious activities of those working there against Iran. As this article appeared immeaic 3 t©ly of ter the visit of the Governor-General to Mehabod ^ the flTit Xi ndertaken by a Governor-General for three years) it appear® likely to have been inspired by him. Two cattle-drovers were Murdered by Kurds a few lays ago on the Rhoi-Maraud road and robbed of their money. Before the Kurds could make off with their cattle a truck containing several Russian soldiers happened to arrive on th© scene. The soldiers opened fire on the fleeing Kurds. 241. An11-Bahai Moverent . Thar© are signs of this movement extend ing to Azerbaijan, feveral of the less responsible Mullahs in Tabriz and elsewhere are busy inflaming fanaticism against this sect and the chief of police in Ardebil, who wee on 1©' ve in ''abriz, has b en recalled to his poet to deal with anti-Behai derronstrations. 242. Labour Situation in Tabriz. It is believed that the fusion of the Tudeh Union and the orkers Union into th© Workers Council was promoted by the Soviet Consul*te-Geaerel, which likewise insisted on th© appointment of Birya as president, an unsuccessful claimant to this honour was th© fellow Tudeh demagogue, Ahmed Ispahan!• c /consolation-3- oonsolation he «as sent as a delep;- « to the Tudeh Iran eonferenoe in Tehran. Tb6 negotiations between the workers end f^otory owners tor a new setileiTient of outstanding differences are naking so? 9 e progress, but, as th® works' s * deTiands increase with every concession aade.most owners desnair of any firro agreement end talk about closing down. The owners also complain of intimidation and say that they are unable to defend their viewpoint during the neg otiations for fear of personal violence. In the meanti? a production continues to decline and coats to mount, making an eventual crisis in all seeming inevitable. £43• laMPoIz k^J^^rtroent . The number of coupons now et- ted to kave been collected by Vensouri and his accomplice® under the protest that they were worthless has risen from 80,000 to 110,000. Although the unmasking of Mansouri% plan *ms due to the Director of Finance more than to any other person this has not prevented hi from being grossly libelled. Statements have been costed on walls to the effect that *this old thief 1 ’ had arranged the ramp for his personal profit. Majidzadeh’s righteous indignation was aroused and suspecting that the notices had been printed by the ’Akhtar~i-3hira1 1 press, he proceeded there to make some forceful enquiries. It appears he was mistaken in his conjecture, but he succeeded in offending the editor, who in revenge published the text of the anonymous notice in the next amber of hi® paper with various additional oomr ents of his own to the effect that if kajidzadeh is as honest as he pretends why should he wor y about his detractors. The upshot is that the Director of Finance is now afraid to show his face in public and only leaves his house for his office. The way of th® virtuous official is indeed hard, for in snite of all the opportunities of hla position there is no evidence that he Mas ever been cor Mint. The Supply Department has published a notice that the distribution of piece goods will b© started when that of sugar is completed, but it is likely to be held up until the new series of retion coupon® is issued so as to ©void the hardships that would ensue to th© persons who too soon surrendered their old ones. It appears th-it Mr. Allen was to take charge of the Supply Department under th© general supervision of the Director of Finance, but th© is tter has informed th© Governor-General that he does not nropose to interfere or limit his freedom of action. Meanwhile Mr. Allen is handicapped in framing any long terip ns by th© fact that he as only a Soviet residence permit valid for two months and that this does not cover visits to West ern Azerbaijan. 244. jioctda .ver.^rt ent. An official of this depart', ent at tes that th© Government has granted a credit of 401,D00 tomans for the repair of the road from Tabriz to Takestan and. one of 800,000 tomans for the Julfa-Tabriz road. Th© ?ork in both cases is to be carried out under Doviet military control. This seems a further example of Soviet success in making the Iranian Government pay for their military requirement®. Credits have also been granted for the repair of the Tabriz-Ahefe and Belasavar-Ardebil roads, which are both indispensable for the transport of large quantities of wheat, k credit of 50,000 tomans has also been requested for the Ardebil-Astars road so a® to permit the moving of wheat by this alternative route. 245. Tabriz later Supply . The population has been suffering consid- er&lt;ubl© hardship'through water shortage, the Municipality being quite incarnbl© of exercising any proper control over the various proprietors. Persons who are entitled to receive w^tsr and have paid for it find that their w ter is being diverted to othe s who are paying as much as His.800 per hour. It is sug ested that municipal officials, whose unofficial income® heve been cut since the suppression of the octroi are parties to these irregularities. The w* tor supply is in any cos© now quite inadequate to satisfyvi ail Tmi&amp;omble needs of the population, although it oould b immediately inereased by sinking Artesian wells, re airing existing channels and suppressing wrongful diversion, not to mention the mere ambitious schemes for using th© water reserves of Azerbaijan. A party of I oviet engineers are at present engaged in prospecting si es in Tabriz for Artesian wells for military needs. £46. jui^ly oX - ulfa Drugs . M. .S.C. some time ago permitted the 1 port of 83,000 tablets of sulfa drugs ordered from the United States by a Tabriz merchant on condition that ar-engements were made for their sale at s reasonable price by this Consu4ate- Oenerel. The drugs are now being retailed at 1.25 rials per tablet by two chemists in Tabriz against doctor*s rresori tions and e quantity has also been disposed of to the American hospital. These dmgs were previously being sold at TUa.s.EO ^er tablet. t the present price both the importer and the retailer are gettinc a fair profit. £47. Tabriz iJupplias . The butchers have won their contest with the I/unlegality anA mutton is again being sold at the old price. £48. Soviet Oom'Msr cl&amp;l Activities. There is a rumour that the Soviet Trwde Agency is about to open a largo shop in Tabriz for the sale of lioviot goods direct to the ublic. If this proves to be correct the ef•eet on local tr de s will be serious. The &lt;?urabcM Textile Factory has completed a contr ct for the supply of 100,000 metres of overcoating materials to the Soviet Army, but contends that it cannot undertax* further contract at the some price. The oviet authorities are however unwilling to ray more and have told the proprietor, according to his own story, that if he will not accent their terms they will oblige hi to close down as his workers will revolt. The Russians have recently sold approxi ately 60 tons of soft sugar at Bis.110 per kilo, most of which wes imrediately despatched to Tehran. They have also sold about 50 b los of cotton piece goods at prices ranging from Fls.5f to 75 per metre. £4S. Other Com ©rclal ilawe . Owing to Haraazan and general uncertain ty all markets have rcSSTned extrsnely quiet. In spite of the lower wholesale prices of certain commodities the cost of living continues to increase, one principal cause being the rise in price of locally produced foodstuffs. The Iraqi Consul states that considerable quantities of dried fruits are being smuggled into Iraq via barciasht with return consignments of cloth, shoes, etc., from Baghdad. &amp;5Q. Consular Movements . M.Korkut, Turkish Consul General, who had been 111 for eight months, has been t ansfer ed to Ankara. He will be repl iced by M.Koral Karmwn, who is expected at Tabriz within a few days. '4.3; rge Harchenko, oviet Vice-Consul, has left for Moscow on transfer. British ‘onaula t©-General, Tabriz.

Tbe only jar fl ing in Tabriz and T'urdish even tJbjgL^abOWr^rittiation is much better at the moment of writing, possibly WOTrrno Soviet influence being used cn the side of paoiflostion. If this is the correct explanation, and there is some reason to think: so, it is an encourr ging sign for the future. A more helpful attitude on the part of the Hassians also seems to be visible in ^ezaieh, where there is a marked return of general confidence. 222. Local Officials. Ur. M. Muaavi, the Director of Public Health, hrs resigned. The department’s employees are owed considerable arrears of salary and, led by Birya of the Workers Council, told him to the accompaniment of various threats that if he could not help them he h d better go. Mr. Thomas Allan, formerly of the Bread and Cereals section of the Mill spa ugh Mission, hr.s returned to Tabriz from Tehran to take over the Supply Department. The Director of Finance has informed the Supply Department in a circular letter that in future its officials will take their orders from Mr. ^llen and not act without his knowledge. Mr. vllen has a &gt;oviet permit for a two months stay. He is accompanied as his as sistant by Mr. Wilum Hansen who was previously in charge of Government transport here. 22b. Tabriz Deputies. It is satisfactory to note a consider able diminution of interest in the fete of the Soviet nominees and that the agitation on their behalf h s almost ceased. At a meeting organized by the Anti-Fascifct Party outside the Public Garden on August IBth to ventilate this and related grievances no more than 150 -200 people -ere present and even they were apathetic. 224. Russian Affairs, ^he Red Army Garden Party is believed to have resulted in the collection of about Rls.l,500,000, but the final figure is not yet known. The Red Army was not the only one to profit, for the local alters at supper Cstla.700 per head md drinks in proportion) failed to account for Up. 30,000 - 4^,000 of the money they had received. An American auction br ught in large sums, Rls. 90,000, for example, for a Red Star in gold and Rls.60,000 for a bottle of champagne. The successful auctioneer was no other than Bazourg Ibrahimi, an accomplice of General Muqaddom in the sugar scaxidals, who recently went into hiding until the warrant issued for his arrest had been withdrawn. He also made a highly laudatory speech about the Red Army to an audience which, apart presumably from the Russians, all knew that he had previously been an equally fervent Nazi. The Governor-General has been much criticised for lending himself as an instrument of extort ion by selling flowers, etc. This was consider# hirhly de rogatory to his dignity. It is also of interest to note that tickets for this festivity for which buyers had had to nay comparatively large sums were resold on the streets at Rls.20 to 30. The Russians h&amp;ve considerably tightened up their control of Persian travellers and vehicles on the Tabriz-Tehran road. Not only must Persians now produce their identity cards, but they are often questioned as to the purpose and destination of their journey, and some h ve even been turned back. Vehicles are also being examined to see whether they are using stolen Lend-Lease tyres or other parts and many such have been con fiscated. Owners of private transport are now chary of using this road. The commissar of police of the 7th di trict*recently obliged a cafe proprietor to give up his premises on the pretext that the Russians anted them for a propaganda shop. Instead, /however-2- however, it was fiven to two i menians to start a bar, tbe Armenians giving him Rla.50,000 key nuney. This money is stated to have been, shared with a subordinate employee of the Russ i n Consulate-General. The same ocrriciissar is believed to b&amp;ve oolleoted considerable sums of money from occupants of other houses by pretonUng that the Russians wished tc requisition their premises and offering to arrange for their continued oossesaion for a suitable consideration. The f Akhtori bhim&amp;lj an independent loc 1 paper, has published an article written by one Mahmoud Rahmin Rajahi stat ing that there exists a group of traitors working for a foreign power who are spreading the rumour that Azerbaijan is to be seo-i rated from Iran, for whom Azerbaijanis have* often shed their blood and are prepared to do so ag in if necessary. A meeting was held at the Grovernorate-General on August ISth to elect the committee of the local Soviet - Iranian Cultural Society. It was decided that the Governor- General and the Soviet Consul-General should be joint presidents and a committee of fourteen members was chosen, including the commander of the Fersian troops, the Mayor, the head of the Education Department and the pre -ident of the Chamber of Commerce. The rest of the committee are persons of no con sequence. 225. Rezaieh. Although the general situation in Western Azerbaijan is quiet there are reports thet the Governor- General be s not yet solved his inherited difficulties with Zero Beg. Zero is now said to have cut off the water of the Baranduz villagers until such time as the villagers agree to pay him a fifth part of all their crops. This is a serious matter for them, at this season as it threatens their rice, melons and other products. The Gov*raor-General is apparent ly of opinion that the only way of stooping Zero 3eg f s law lessness is to disarm him, but Zero says he will forcibly resist any such attempt. in Assyrian named Babagian, who was arrester; for having incited the Kurdish looting of Fersian vill ges in the Baranduz district over a ye^r ago, has been judicially shot in front of his house in the village of Balanich as an example to other disturbers of the oeoce. The Governor-General has forbidden the carrying of all arms in Rezaieh by Turds as by others. The municipality has taken successful steps to limit the prices of fresh produce, which is substantially cheaper than at Tabriz, where speculation at the expense of the consumer continues unchecked. 226. Other Kurdish affairs. M.Melikov of the Soviet Consulate in Rezaieh visited Ghazi Mohammed in Mahabad on ugust 11th. and had several hours private conversation with him. The pretext of the visit is said to have been the set lament of a dispute between Ghazi Mohameci and Suvar Agha, one of the chiefs of the Mangour tribe. Major Curqusal of the Persian Air Force h s arrived in Mahobad to take up his post as military governor and is staying with Rahmat Shafii, a local merchant. Shortly f:fter his arrival he was visited by two Soviet officers from Mianduab. He has since fallen ill with typhoid. His prospects of exer ing any influence are not bright. Only forty to fifty members of the Persian garrison are said to remain in Saqqiz, the rest having moved South to fight the Jaf Kurds from Iraq. Sadr Ghazi continues to utilize his position as a member of the Majlis for the benefit of his friends. He has arranged for the lease of a government owned village near Bukan to be transferred from the Faisullah Begi tribe to Hama Rashid. The latter’s followers have already turned out the former occupants, who not thought likely to take it lying down. Sadr Ghazi has also a ranged that Abdul igha, son /ofof Mahmoud ilkhant m Gas la Ar.lia Slkhaal 'ade, .fetjwa of imfr asfid, aho^uld rai©© a fo^oa of savaotsy puart!!® to protect th© road from Hi nduab to aqqiz. Thle rood lioa moatiy through territory occ piad by mXr Assad’s part of th-; Deboukri tribe. Aa hi^n relatioua with his two nephowa are strained, there in a possibility of trouble. He naturally thinks th? t the more is directed against his authority and eontonda that his trlbeaz&amp;Sf! are sire dy aa^tirli&amp;a f?ood order in this partloular district. The Faiaullah Bag! branch of the Beg^ada tribe hare stolen 1,4tKi sheep from the TiUaga of ihahladaak n© r UaraalM be ion U n to a Persian landlord named Ya&amp;in 3-aahgar. r»rt of the stolen sheep have been recovered by the Mianduab gendarsi- ori© from Mahmoud Shajai in Bukan, to whom they had been paa. ad over. Lahenoud h &amp; also bet&gt;n arrested. The re st of the sheep have been taken off by the tribe. Ztv.

Vhlic' escorting the trucks removing the 1 at of the* Corooret- ion f a property to Tehran, 'r. ynno, their road inspector, was severely injured in an accident near Ml&amp;nah and removed to hospital at Tehran. Labour Situation in fsbrin. During the ©ftrlier part of tne momh several further unruly Incidents occurred, such as an assault on the cashier of the isserb? ijan Spinning Factory fifhi the Inpriaonmant of th© ownerbrother at the Iran '^tch Factory, all accompanied by arbitrary and unraes nable demands on the part of th© workers. The owners, in despair, ^ftwr falling to get ny tangible help from the Gov* rncr-Oener^l, who merely advocate* patience in thtse difiicnlt times, telegraphed to the Prim© Minister and Hajlie saying that they would either h»ve to com© to an agreement with the worker* which would be respected or they would be compelled to close their factories. m he Governor-General is likewise said to nave told the Soviet Consul-General tht.t he could not &lt;$ rry on if th© disorders conlnued anri th© letter was also apps- led to by the iresident of th© Chamber of Industry and others. It is oi course, a matter or general knowledge that the labour aglt tor* h* v© been in touch with th© Soviet Const* Is ft ©—General and it Is firmly bt^ii ved thfat they h«.5v© received ©nooumgarient iuid protectiou. In the o&amp;et week there h ve baon signs that the Soviet hounds have been called off: in th© words of th© Soviet Consul-General, *3t©os h va been taken to Improve the situation’*, and the workers # re at the moment quiet. The factory owners are mkin# a renewed effort to ranch © definite ngraemsnt with the workers f recrer«otativs* f which should be possible if the f ovist authoritlais really desire tranquill ity. i com; iseion from Tehran, repre exiting the Ministry of th© Interior, the Ministry of Justice ami the Police Department, ft s been iavestigi ting the eirctmntsnces of Khalil Inqil^b’s arrest on July 14th. with a view to fixing th© responsibility ior th© accompanying bloodshed.

It b^s been dec idea to open a school working on the same syllabus as Armenian schools in Sr Ivan. The principal lan^niBgos will be Ihissian and Armenian, Persian being releg ted to a very minor place in one class only. After a lively meeting it was decided to admit leftisb elements to controlling positi ns in preference to the wealth ier and more oonserv tive members of the community. 231 Return of 5 olitical Intt rnces, ©tc. Hussein Ouli Katlbl, formerly onitor of the ♦Fariyaf f newspaper and head of the Irani Bidsb party, has now returned to Tabriz and prooosoe to restart bis paper. He had been arrested by the Russians end interned at Arak and Resbt. a leading Tabriz Nazi called Nams&amp;ehl, a former employee of olfinger, the I.Q.Farben agent, has likewise returned and opened a ahop. He hfid fled for safety to Tehran at the atart of the Bussi n ooeupatl n. 232. Supply Department. Maneouri, whose attempted s•indie was described in paragraph 205 of this Diary, hoc been sent beck to Tehr n under custody. As his scheme has been to a gre t extent frustrates, it is thought thut he has not made sufficient money to purohese hiK freedom. Altogether his agents collected f bout 80,000 supposedly worthless coupons when istsuing questionnaires for the new issue, against these coupons Jv d his plan worked he would have obtained His. 12,000, 000 wort* of rationed goods. One of his agents alone had collected 10,000 coupons and had offered an official Rls 500,000 if he could have them made valid. Another irregularity that has come to light is the theft of thousands of blank identity cards from the registration department•• These h^ve been filled out ?nd completed with forged seels and eorres &gt;onding ration cardtJ issued. This fraud has been worked for several months and has constituted a considerable t r in on supplies of monopoly goods. A still further irregularity to be discovered is the adulteration of supply department tea stocks with tea substitutes and the replacement of white sugar by wet yellow sugar. A notice has been published that landlordr; must give undertakings for the sale of grain co the Government by the end of Shobrivar, otherwise officials will be sent to collect the landlord’s quota plus an additional quantity to cover their expenses. Mr. Alien st tag that ho does not propose to purchase grain from districts where it cannot be collected with the available transport, important quantities of l&amp;i?t sei sons grtin purchesed by the Government having been left to rot ss it could not be moved. Mr. Allen has also settled the 1 ng outstanding cl£im of Amir As and to additional sugar to the 1* ttar’a apparent sat isfaction. 233. Tabriz Meat Supplies. The Municipality has attempted to reduce the price of mutton froas Rls. 120 to His. 108 per batman* The butchers now refuse to kill as they contend that they cemnot afford to sell at the now price* and Tabriz has been practically with ut roe t of any sort for some days. It is thought th*’t the Municipality will give way to the strikers and reimpose the old price. 234. Marriage Customs and Morals. The ’Kharv&amp;r Nov* has drawn attention to the serious deterioration of loc 1 morals resulting from the exist inf'; marriage law and customs which render it Impossible for many young people of both sexes to Contract suitable alliances. In these circumstances, the paper says, every d«y the young men are consorting with pro stitutes, blighting their lives by oontr cting disease, /deprivingdepriving their future wives of health end enjoyrient, spreading the disease among their near friends and relatives ©n&amp; uselessly spending their mensy on drugs and doctors, while their children will be unhealthy and diseased* You can see these young men daily in the IHiiyeb^n, the paper continues, trying to seduce our daughters r=nd sisters to extinguish the lire of their lust, cheating thera with flattery and fair ords, but abandoning them as soon ns their deeir s are reached and conderaning them to swell the number of prostitutes* Let us, the ? rticle o ncludee, accept our share of the responsibility for this state of affairs and by establishing good marriage Imvs fnd customs save our oeople from Paris':lag utterly* T*C*£bPp.

They had, however* not even troubled, he said, to bring them previous ly to his notice. The fact of considerable Hues!an pressure, as recorded in paragraph 117 of this Jlary, is nevertheless confirmed ^ from several sources. xb&amp; new deputies have now left for Tehran.

This is the only remaining oonstitutency in which voting has not oeen completed. Things have not, however, been i,oing smoothly owing to the attempt of Tudeh Iran and the Russians to impose an unknown mullah, dheikh Hussein Lenkorani, on the electors, voting was suspended for some time, but has now been resumed, apparently the Governor-General was privately tipped from Tehran to back nenkorani, out he states that he telegraphed notwitnstanding to tbs Prime minister asking him to Inauce the iOist, tatis to refrain frc»a interference, henkorani has recently been in Tehran participating in the campaign against deyyid 2 ia. JM...a!A aira*. ^ large cinema which is to show exclusive ly a evict films (see paragraph 118 of this diary) is the Cinema Stars. A large sum of money for its completion is being advanced through Abraham Gog an, cinema owner of Tehran, who is also stated to be the chief distributor of boviet films in Iran. The management of the Cinema Dideban in Tabriz has succumbed to the insistence of the Soviet Conaulate-Gemral that at least one film in three should be Russian. A higher proportion was at first demanded, but the owner held out against it am Gov let films are less popular than the American and British films he has previously shown almost exclusively. The Vatan Tolindm*, the soviet Turk! nev/sp^per, has ceased for the moment to publish its propaganda articles about Boviet Azerbaijan* 4 .his appears to be in deference to a request made by the Governor-General, who took exception to many of the articles as well as it a publication in Turk!. The large pavilion in the Tabriz public gardens is to be handed ov^r to the xoiasians for the duration of the war, other accommodation being found for the destitute sick who are its present occupants, it is to be used for a permanent exhibition of Russian trade and culture as well as to house a Soviet-Iranian civilian club, which is about to be started.

Sovlet-Armenian activities * Ihe Armenian community have attached a special aignificance to the visit about a month ago of )r. Ashot tbrahamlan, a professor of history at the Armenian University at iiriv.in* he came as an envoy from the Motherland of irmenians to strengthen relations with her sons in other lands and addressed a record gathering of Armenians f incluciing the Archbisliop and many otiier church representatives, he claimed that in soviet Armenia Armenian culture hid reached its zenith, hr. Abrahamian left Tabriz for Tehran, *her© he was received by the xrime Minister to tender ivTaunia*© tnanhs for Iranian hospitality to Armenians. It appears that the Prime Minister gave some promise about the re-opeuing of Armenian schools. if ter Tehran r. hrahamiaa proposed to visit Isfahan, oaghdad, Beirut, Jerusalem, Alexandria and Oairo to meet the Armenian coasAuniMe* in those cities, lie stated that he would give further lectures in xabriz on his ruturn journey. jt article on 9th ^ay in tiie Tehran Armenian newspaper ’Alik* on tiie changes in the Soviet constitution stated that while the soviet Union agreed in principle to the terms of the Atlantic Charter nevertheless those Soviet republics that have national, economic, historical and international rights, and to whom injustice was done { in the last war, would receive new territories. There is a general feel log among Amenisaas that this principle will be evoked with I regard to both Azerbaijan and Armenia. 13?. urdish If airs* The Iraqi consul has stated that several cases are known to him of Tabriz merchants who, failing to obtain vlsos for Iraq in a regular manner, have visited Baghdad and returned to Tabriz without experiencing the slightest difficulty, passing the frontier with the help of Kurds* The Governor-UeneraL stated on 24th May that he had received confidential information from Tehran that it is proposed to send Iranian troops to Mahabad, but ^artip Jawadi subsequently said that the prospect was not ii^iediate. It is quite likely that there has been some postponement as G&amp;rhang Varah&amp;rum, who was supposed to be arranging the move from ^ianduab, has now returned to Tabriz* On tba other hand it is learnt from a good source that all conscripta from Azerbaijan are at present being sent to Tehran to form a Uahabad 'tipi® hama Eashid, a Baneh chieftain with a large following, has gone to Gardasht and it is thought h© may be out for trouble, he pretends to be nourishing some grievance about the conduct of the Uaqqis electian, complaining that the Kurds were denied the opportunity of voting. There is a good deal of sporadic disorder in widely separated districts, such as is bound to occur so long as the Kurds hare arms and the authorities no power or prestige. There is a report of an increase of Kurdish robueries from ^ahabad, while near Hezaieh Kurds have cut the water supply of four non-Auraish villages. 2 ,ero deg, having succejafully levied tribute on other goods passing through his district, has now helu up a couple of cars for a ransom of Ala. 70,000 There is also again some unrest among the dhikkak Kurds further to toe north. There are no reports of any special soviet activities in these districts, although Tudeh Iran Is Increasing its activity in /villages4. villagas near Hazsiieh as it is also in villages round Tabriz and other centres of population* Distribution of the land among tbs peasants appears the principal point of their programme to be emphasised* lb8* Tabriz Donvqy r;ou *** while military convoys remain suspended* ^jwlth strong rumours of this suspension becoming permanent* the d*H*0*U* continue to operate at a reduced and irregular pressure* The hoviet authorities have rounded up a gang near J&amp;ianeh* including several Kussian soldiers* who had been engaged in systematic thieving on the convoy route. Among the articles recovered are* it is stated* three tyres belonging to the U.K.O.O** which are to be returned when the enquiry is completed. The same authorities have also confiscated all the motor spare parte and accessories to be found at Maraud* which for some time has been the leading market in these articles in Azerbaijan* all of them of course being stolen. In one way it fulfilled a useful function as it enabled local vehicles to be kept on the road, including Iranian government trucks* which would otherwise have had to be laid up in the absence of any other source of supply* 139. uabrlz ^unlcj.pallW* The Mayor states that* although the town s budget has been approved for the current three months* he can obtain no funds from the Finance Department, which in turn can obtain no instructions from Tehran. The Finance Department collect the taxes ior the Municipality on a commission basis* but has no authority to hand them over without sanation from the capital. In the meantime salaries and wages are in arrears and there is no money available for essential work such as repairing roads. The Mayor adds that the municipal garden can only be got ready for the summer season with iunue provided out of his own pocket. There are many complaints of a similar state of affairs in other departments: and Dr. Millspaugh is widely blazed. It is fortunate* however* for most of tl» victims that they long since ceased to regard their official salary as the only remuneration to \$iich their position entitles them. This no doubt explain© why they are taking it so well. IjO* li£bour ..tyijUjtASB l^fJabyi,^.?, Aeferenee was made in paragraph 125 of this Diary to the presence in Tabriz of Khalil Xnqilab* who had apparently come here to organise a merger between the Workers * Union and Xudeh Union. A telegram has since been received by the head of the Department of Industry in Tabriz from the Workers ( Union , in Tehran to the effect that Xnqilab has been expelled from the Union and nas no authority to aot on its behalf. The Dove mo r-General has ;also received a telegram from the Prime Minister authorising him to banish him should he cause any trouble* The Governor-General has been visiting various factories in Tabriz and hopes to reintroduce a certain element of discipline wh^re the workers and their unions have got out of hand, he has had two agitators arrested and has also given instructions that workers f who do not work shall not be paid. Me has likewise, so he states* imoimad the acting doviet Gonsul—General that he must not interfere in labour matters as they do not in any way concern him. The Tudeh Union organised a large meeting of workers on 26th *iay when strong protests were made against the labour mobilisation bill as well as the nefarious activities of Geyyid 2ia. The usual telegram was despatched to Tehran. 141* rbalj anjfrala situation. There is much criticism and no support of the recently published official prices of this season's grain. The reductions are thought to be unfair and unwise as costs of production nave increased and so have the prices of all essential commodities* It is also held that enough account has not been token of local conditions^ m, to take one example, when a lower /price/144. price i© olferea tor wheat in frontier districts it may ‘rove to be direct encouragement to amu^Xin^ out of the country. /Iiotiwr point made ia that the prices should have been fixed with m eye on the precarious transport position and that more inducement should have been offered lor deliveiy at central collecting points, v dullicient stocks of grain have now been accumulated in /-Nj outlying districts to supply Tehran with at least 10,000 tons of wiicat as well as to form a substantial grain reserve In the Tabriz silo, nut the problem of transport remains to be solved, details of the position being given ia tte immediately following paragraph, /ai grain contracts with the ihisaiaas have now been oomoleted tiid no fresh engagements have yet been entered into. LrmMPQrt bitufttion. According to figures compiled by Mr. Msnaen. for the information of the Transport Operations lection at iehran, there art at present in Azerbaijan over 25,000 tons of grain, aoout tfco thirds being wheat, which belong to the Government find mqxLxr* to be transported within the next two and a half months l.e. beiore this season's crop falls to be dealt with. To cope fully with the situation eighty large trucks are immediately needed to supplement existing transport, otherwise Mr. Hansen thinks that the vemment st«uid to lohse up to 10,000 tons of grain. The HumIms are co-operating in moving grain to ilianeh from points on the main iabriz-Miazieh road: and the additional transport is required for bringing the 8,500 - 10,000 tons in the Ardebil district to bostanabad. Go far 2,900 tons of wheat for Tehran have been sent to the rail tie ad at Mian&amp;h and the auc clans are now engaged in moving an add it. anal 600 tons from stores on the convoy route. The balance of 6,500 tons will be supplied from stocks at /j-debil as and when transport allows, existing transport has also to cope with the moving of 15,000 tons from liar to Tabriz, 1,500 tons fro© Mionduab is ana 400 fr^m the Khoi-Ohahpur-Maka district to Tabriz. ; or wheae hauls the X.O. Pool trucks and contracted trucks will be used. Mr. Hansen states that on his recent visit to Tehran he understood that the proposal to use U.iUC.G. trucks was not likely to matei ial ice, v hll# a suggestion he made that Iranian army trucks at present laid up for lack of credits to run them should be utilised was turned down by the American military advisers on the ground that the Russians were unlikely to allow them to leave Azerbaijan again, existing trucks are also rapidly deteriorating rand unless the transport organisation receives a thorough overhaul the situation vath regard to the present season's harvest will be still worse. Practically all available transport is now allocated to grain transport, ihia means that other essential commodities for the population cannot be carried. At Aenjan, for example, 200 tons of wea, o tons of piece goods and 600 tons of sugar are awaiting •transport and in the meantime are exposed to theft and other forms 2* 8 V x&gt;abri ^ It530 tons of tobacco await transport to Tehran xor wixe tobacco monopoly, while tbei’e are also large Quantities of merchant goods held up throughout Azerbaijan. ‘ 4X ‘.

He thought that Iranians themselves could not have caused greater muddle and confusion, lie mentioned several cases known to him of cotton goods being left to rot in daiap vara ho uses, of stocks of sugar left to deteriorate, of merchants goods being held up through red tape. In labri* there has, he mentioned, been no distribution of sugar for three months and there is no prospect of any is.ua of cotton material. There is also a growing feeling of discontent in Tabriz with the lack of positive achievement on the part of the director of finance, who has to shoulder reap ana ibility for the vUpply /apartment here, and it is likely that an attempt will be made to secure his removal. Me was formerly secretary to hr* -iillspaugh and speaks English, facts which recommend him to the uaerioan ^is&amp;lon, but are no extenuating circumstances in local eyes. 127. n uaBian ^c anomi c fi airs.

It is proposed, in the i first place, to open a Kussian hospital with Russian staff for the benefit ol the local population. In the second place the population are to be provided with schools offering primary to higher education in Russian and Turki. Buildings for botn a hospital and schools are being actively sought, thought the Persian authorities are resisting the suggestion that a large Persian school near the (lovemerate-Cfreneral should be handed over. It is said that the bullainge taken over would serve a temporary purpose only, as perman ent premises would be erected later. hit nil* ic&amp;ut, too, is the re-appearance of the Rues i an—backed Turki newspaper 'Vatan Yolinda 1 (’For the r atherUna’) edited by a Russian Jimehian recently arrived from Baku named hhahgsldi assisted by a large staff of Caucasians, which some estimate at between thirty and fodrty. The paper is printed at the X^uasian military printing press in Tabriz. There are also strong rumours that more Caucasians are expected in connection with the projected schools. There is again widespread talk of a Greater Azerbaijan: the Caucasian immigrants themselves talk of a Rew Caucasus. A story is also circulating of a traveller from Tehran who, when he arrived at the Russian control post at Bostanabad, was asked where he was going. He replied: 'From Tehran to Tabriz*', to which the guard retorted that lie ought to say from Iran to Azerbaijan. There is also renewed unrest of an industrial character which is not unconnected, although the connection may wall be indirect, with bovlet activities. Factory workers are putting forward new and extravagant demands under the influence of the anti-capitalist agitators of the workers union. The Oovernor-ueneral has lately had one agitator arrested. The Russian cavalry which constituted the main portion of the garrison here appears to have been relieved by infantry in the course of the past few days. There still continue to be many complaints of hold-mps ©nd robberies by Soviet soldiers and a nritish doctor to-day produced his much battered and blood-stained assistant for inspection. He had been robbed and beaten-up yesterday evening at about 8.50 pin. when on his way home in a public thoroughfare near a Persian police station. The servant of another acquaintance was roobed the same evening. From the cases that come to one’s personal knowledge it is clear that the practise remains widespread. The Boviet Consulate General invited the local authorities and members of foreign consulates to a performance given by an Armenian concert party on April l£th. The performances which are continuing in Tabriz and elsewhere are in aid of Armenian charities. 87* Kurdish A ff airs. T.M. Consul-General paid a visit to Western Azerbaijan from AprU 10th to 13th. A separate report haa been submitted to H.M. Ambassador on the information and impressions gleaned during this tour. 3iaoe returning to Tabriz it has been learnt that the chief of the Gendarmerie at Khoi, Sarhang Teymouri, was wounded by Jelali Kurds near Maku about the loth instant, his servant and two gendarmes who were with him being killed. It appears that the Kurds attacked them with a machine gun. It is understood that Sheikh Latif nas now left Sirdaeht for Iraq. 88. Brit ion military Convoys.

The Ruasiana sent, he has stated, a mission from Aioacow, but negotiations were not easy in view oi tne number of safeguards on which the nussiazis wished to insist. The Russian and iersi&amp;n estimates oi t cost of upkeep were also widely divergent, the former being 30,000,000 rials per annum and /'Ntne latter 60,000,000. The Russians estimated their future yearly traffic at 450,000 tons, lor which they were prepared to pay 6,000, - ooo rials. The iersiana estimated their Income from other traffic would be 4,000,000 rials, so that there will, on anybody’s showing, be a considerable deficit to be made good by a TersIan government subsidy. Notwithstanding, a draft agreement was drawn up for submission to toe Tersian government, but the governmental changes prevented its ratification, houie members of the Russian miss ion still remain apparently in Tehran. 91* fabric Tear an .Ur Service.

Allen of tne Millapaugh kisslon^is at present in Tabriz attempting to obtain reliable lafomation as to the exact position, he xia© not yet completed hie enquiries, which he aoes not consider have been facilitated by the local off icials, whom his knowledge oi tne local languages oensee to be very wary, xte is, however, persisting and hopes finally to obtain reliable figures, his iiret impression is that the Director oi Finance, in spite of his professions, has never been really anxious to get Azerbaijan grain to Tehran and that he has not succ eeded &amp;s ns should have done in producing some semblance of order in a choatiu sltuatl &lt;n. Nor does tie consider that ^r. kajidzadeh has by any means made the best use of his available transport. xhe Director of finance published a notice on ^arch 29th offering to purchase grain for one month at the same prices as heretofore with the additional inducement of 12 kilos of sugar at the Government price for each ton of wheat and 10 kilos for each ton of oarley. kr. ^ajiuzaaeh said he was anxious to purchase all that he could as quickly as possible in case of crop failure elsewhere. This measure has, however, been very widwly condemned as unnecessary and harmful. It has resulted in a steep increase of grain prices on the open xaarket at a time when tixey were falling} and opponents argue that the grain could have gradually been purchased at lower prices without the offer of sugar. It was also a departure from the principles that x..r. kajidzadeh has himself so often advocated and all the motives may not yet be evident. It seems to have resulted in considerable sales in some districts, but many owners are still holding large quantities in the nope of a further rise in price. 9b# iransport department* «.r. Vilium uanaen has returned to Tehran after his three months efforts to reorganise the department, he met with ©otae success, but the old gang are quickly resuming control and persons he engaged as reliable are now being discharged, air. *dLlsn said that it was hoped to send a competent successor, but the task is entirely a thankless one for m honest official. The whole department is i^idaled with graft. Recently fifty two trucks under contract were released by Iransovtrans and returned to their owners minus tyres, which were the property of the company. In order to obtain tyres for titws© vehicles by filling in the requisite forms triinsport department oilicials are demanding 30,000 rials per vehicle from the owners and a further 3,000 rials per month for running permits. Rather than leave the lorries standing the owners are being obliged to pay these bribes./ &gt; ; * . 94. ^upuly Department* i^o iasue of piece g&amp;ode has yet been made in Tabriz, thou/ h this has been done in ^ahabad ana Rezaieh. ( f r 4 4 ; • 95* Russian Coiamercial Affairs* the Riusalacns are continuing with their plan of erecting a bulk oil storage depot opposite the TabBiz station (see diary para 24)* They have now agreed to purchase 58,000 square metres of land at Rials 5 per square metre and are awaiting the sanction of the registration authorities in Tehran. In the meantime various construction materials are being accumulated on the site* ih© Russians, led by the acting Oonsul-Gencral, have obliged the iuiosrovi leather factory by the exercise of considerable pressure to lease the annex of their factory at a rental of Rials 9,000 per month to serve as a workshop. There are unconfirmed rumours that the Russians are planning to start four industrial plants in iabriz, Including a ^lass factory* The ixussians have purchased 1,000 tons of raisins at Rials 11 per kilo lor delivery Julfa and Sharif Rhaneh, 500 tons of apricots at i;iala 8 per kilo for delivery at Julfa and also 100 tons of sour apricot kernels at Rials 14*75 per kilo. There is increasing evidence of the corruptibility of Soviet guards at road control posts and appreciable quantities of forbidden exports are finding their way southwards by this mesas* There seems also to be a growing tendency for other Soviet officials to conform to local standards in similar respects. Other Ooiuiucrcial ...&lt;ewa* There has been a renewal of speculat ion and the upward trend of prices. The issue of new banknotes has been widely interpreted as an inflationary measure and there has been a rush to purchase gold and put money into goods, particularly carpets, which have advanced from 10 to 15 . with a further anticipat ed increase, rrieea of wheat, sugar, tea, cotton yarn and most foodstuffs have risen considerablte’. Complaints have been made oy the silkworm cultivators of ATasoaran that they have been unable to obtain silkworm egg a from tae government. Through the intermediary of the Department of Tndastry at Tabriz they offered to deposit the total purchase price with the Rational ^ank, but the only reply they could obtain was that they should present themselves in Tehran to arrange the deal. They decided that they could afford neither the Journey to Tehran nor the bribes likely to be expected of them when they reached it* (3gd.) T.C.

Oeaeral aituatiort ; 1 r tlow Kuz has found ths population of Azer- baijan as a whole in a much batter position than a year ago. The winter has been mild, bread plentiful and cheaper, wages considerably higher and public health satisfactory. Spring has come early and crop prospects are excellent. Given favourable climatic conditions for the next few weeks, this year’s harvest may well equal that of last year. Crop prospects in the Caucasus are also believed to be similarly good. Polling in Tabriz for the Majlis election finished on March 20th but the results will not be known for about another month. The most remarkable feature has been the indifference of the mass of the Tabriz population, less than one third of the electors recording their vote. There has been much criticism of the candidates in general and those actively supported by the Hussians in particular. There is a feeling that they are mostly unworthy representatives, little likely to fur ther the people’s interests. Many people think that the Russians have shown very poor Judgment in the choice of their candidates, who could never be anything more than Majlis nonentities as they lack both experience and capacity. One Persian official recounts that he asked Pishivari, the Russian number one, why he had come to Tabriz. He replied that he had come to be elected to the Majlis. Our friend then asked him what qualifications he had for the position, to which Pishivari replied that he had once been in prison. 'hat has also made an unhappy Impression is the openness of Russian interference and many ask themselves why, if Russian intentions towards Azerbaijan are honest, they should struggle so desperately to secure the return of their nominees. It nil seems, in local opinion, to augur badly for the future. The How Ruz holidays have given the opportunity for much dis cussion about the Government changes. The appointment of Mohamed Sasd as Prime Minister has been generally welcomed as he is an Azer baijani. The possibility of Assadullah Mamagani, another local man, becoming Minister of Justice has also given pleasure. What would still be better received would be the recall of Hassan Taghi Zadeh from London to become a member of the Government. He is generally looked on ns Azerbaijan’s foremost citizen. Much interest has been taken in Seyyid Zia-ud-Din’s victory in the Majlis over Dr. MUsaddiq and the former’s stock has risen sharply. 66. Local Officials. The new Governor-General, Mehdi Dadvar, arrived on March 23rd. He has not yet received members of the Consular corps. It is understood that he is indisposed after his journey. 3rd Sarhaag Rlza Jawadi, commander of the skeleton/division, and and Sarhang Fridun Farr, commander of the gendarmerie in Azerbaijan, were both promoted to the rank of Sartip at Kow Ruz. Hi&amp;ayatullah Fumayoun Farr has been appointed head of the posts and telegraphs in Tabriz and has already arrived. Ilasri, head of the same department in Rezaieh, has had his pay doubled to induce him to remain at his post. It is still impossible to find a police chief for the 3rd Ustan. It Is reported that several officials to whom the post has been offered have declined it on the ground that they would be unable to function properly, while the Russians seem to have objected to other candidates. It is also said they favour the complaisant acting official, Yavar Zia. - 67. Tabriz Elections. Although the voting in Tabriz finished on March 20th as already mentioned, it is not yet completed in all the surrounding district. Counting of the Tabriz votes has begun and the first 400 taken show a majority for the Tudeh Iran list.

The international situation, the Kasravi ^ct and the local elections have divided the attention of the population almost equally. Ankara radio is being listened to nightly by all who possess receivers and Tabrizis are anxiously speculating how developments in Turkey may affect their personal security and business. That the war is not yet over has also been emphasised for them by Mr. Churchill’s declaration that he is unable to guarantee the end for this year. This even caused pleasure to merchants holding stocks of imported goods and led to some stiffening of prices. Those numerous persons who harbour pro-German sympathies also gained comfort from his statement that the Germans still have 300 divisions in the field. There is continued misgiving about Russian intentions towards Azerbaijan: and some of those who thought that they could regard Great Britain as an effective guarantor of the Tehran Declaration point to our inability to save Poland, for whom we went to war, from the clutches of the Russian bear. It is argued that now the war has retreated from the Caucasus the Russians need fewer troops in Azerbaijan and apprehension is likewise caused by further arrivals of officers families. Public security remains generally satisfactory, apart from some tribal unrest between Shahpur and Rezaieh to which reference is made below. Bread in plenty and better conditions of employment have warded off any repetition of the proletarian demonstrations of last winter and comparatively mild end open weather has helped the health and well-being of the population. Prospects for next season’s crops- are so far good, though the onset of premature springlike weather is causing some preoccupation. b0. Local Officials . The newly-appointed Governor-General, Mehdi Badvar, has not yet arrived. He is said to be waiting for the Government to place a car at his disposal. 51 . Tabriz Elections . Polling actually started on Darch 2nd, the sole polling station at Tabriz being at the Governorate-General. Tudeh Iran claims that the facilities at this station so pot allow many more than 500 citizens to vote daily. Thus, if the elections are to last for three weeks, not more than 11,500 persons will be able to vote out of the total of 30,000 electors in Tabriz. The scales would thus be weighted against the town where the majority of the party’s adherents reside. The same party is also complaining that no proper arrangements have been made for the workpeople to vote. The polling station closes at the same time as the factorxes and ior tfce reason already stated Friday gives an insufficient opportunity. The scene outside the Governorate presented some animation on the first Friday. A crowd of 3-4,000 had gathered - some aa idle specta tors, some to buy and sell votes and some to see that they were not double-crossed by their supporters. Azudi, the Ministry of the Interior inspector, was recalled to Tehran before the start of the election and actually left Tabriz on March 1st. It is known that complaints had been made against him, including that of undue subservience to the Russians, but the exact cause of his recall is not known. The Russians have continued to exert pressure. In reply to their demand for the election of four candidates - Pishivari, Ipekchian, Mashinohi and Musavi - the Electoral Committee apparently told them that their candidates were practically unknown people, especially in the villages. Ihe Russian attitude to this retort seems at first to have been that it was up to the Electoral Committee to find a way of securing their election.

Widespread interest has been taken decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to extend privilege of diplomatic representation abroad to the individual re publics as it is felt to be a matter closely affecting the future of Azerbaijan. Moslem vieea are generally cautious. While ther« are some who argue that it represents a step forward in the evolu tion of the Soviet political system in a liberal direction end is therefore to je welcomed, the majority incline to the idee that there ia no question of a change of heart but rather of political expediency. With some the German propaganda version that it is a device for further Bolshevisation finds acceptance: by still more the view is taken that it is a method of increasing the weight and influence of Soviet diplomatic representation at a tine when a peace settlement looms large on the horizon. By the Armenians the announcement is generally welcomed. Many Dashnaks have been heard to say that a free Armenia with a powerful protector represents pre cisely their political ambition. Others talk of the possibility the new principle opens up of a Greater Azerbaijan, ihe .w-rMeniens, fearing Moslem reprisals for their pro-Soviet attitude in the event of a complete Russian withdrawal, are anxious for a stabilisation of Soviet influence in Azerbaijan short, however, of complete sub- merffonce in the Bolshevik system. The Moslem population as a whole views any such prospect with dismay end is extremely sensitive to any signs of increasing Soviet penetration. The requisitioning of more houses by the Russian au thorities, combined with the arrival of a number of officers’ fami lies and militarised women, has given rise to a series of hysteri cal rumours, the most exaggerated of which foresees the early es tablishment of two million Russian civilians in Azerbaijan and an equal number in Gilaii. The emphasis here has been on an increase of Russian civilians, not troops, and thore is no reliable evidence that the latter have been substantially increased other than oy the arrival of further base details. It is certain, however, that ail existing Rus3l«n barrack; accommodation is full. It does not seem unnatural that increasing numbers of families should be sent here to join officers who are in Azerbaijan convalescing in view of the comparatively favourable food situation and the improved communica tions with Soviet Russia. The same considerations might also naturally lead to an increased number of light-duty troops. 31 . Local Officials. It has now been announced that Y\xsau^e&amp;- Saltaneh Mehdi Dadvar is to become Governor-General of Western Azerbaijan. No date has yet been given for his arrival at Tabriz. His appointment has aroused comparatively little comment ana f©^ hopes. He is entirely unknown in Tabriz, but the reports of those who have known him elsewhere picture him as one who evades diffi culties and likely to resign if rough weather is met. He is also described ns honest and devout. It is thought he may have one ad vantage as compared with Fahimi in that he will come free from local commitments ana prejudices. The new Governor-General is about seventy years of age. The Farraandar, Mubassir Rosheni, is thought to be about seventy-five. Thus Tabriz is being converted into an 'asile des vieillaros . This carries certain drawbacks with it as no dinner in Tabriz to which the Governor-General or Governor is invited can begin until he arrives. Mubaaslr Roshani accepted an invitation to dinner at the house of a Persian official for last Thursday evening (the one evening of the week his official duties allow him relaxation ana the other guests awaited him for two and a half hours in vain. Fin ally a oar was sent to bring him, but the chauffeur returned to in form the hungry guests that he had long since retired to bea. 32, Tabriz Elections. The election comedy pursues its now dreary course. After it had been decided to post the election notices on /March WMtariW*?P. 'T**^ V ef Stat. Jlr jin Af faitnr, r A, s _ forMarch 12th, dissatisfaction with the renewed postponement was ex pressed in several quarters. Consequently it is now announced that the notices are to he posted on February hist, the elections starting ten days later, i&amp;ibassir Hoshani naa held a meeting of the leading political personalities to ooauaunicate his intention of having the elections conducted on proper lines, free fro«i bribex*y f intimidation or other irregular practices. He proposed to the meeting that they /^should co-operate in this effort and help with the supervision of the (elections especially in the villages, notices signed by the Farmandar and iizucU have also oeen posted in tne town to the effect that the complaints made against tne Electoral Committee had been investigated and found to be groundless: that the Oovemiaent was not giving support to any individual candidates but desired the elections to be free: that any suitable person might become a candidate: that the political parties must assist in keeping good order, and, finally, that the elections will take place very shortly. In the meantime the gendarmes are already at work canvassing in the villages for Iskandarl, the former deputy, who has the advantage of being a near relative of the assistant Commandant of the Gendarmerie. The position with regard to the Soviet candidates remains obscure. It was said at one moment that the Bussiana would after all be satisfied with the election of Plshivari and Ipekohian only, thus making agreement with the Government possible, but the latest report is that they have again increased their demands and are insisting on Mashinohi and Musavi as well. Possibly this is a move by which they eventually hope to be able to compromise for Maahinchi as their third candidate. The official of the Soviet Consulate-General mostly concerned in the negotiations is a Caucasian named Guliov. Members of the Soviet Trade Delegation are also active. The situation is said to be causing a good deal of anxiety to Azudi as he doubts ^is ability to control it successfully. A further postponement would occasion no surprise. ^ ^ r 'Tudeh Iran* have continued to keep themselves to the fore. On February 6th they organised a procession of three to four hundred people who paraded the main etreet of Tabriz bearing placards with the inscription: ^Elections must start immediately, tfo meeting of the Majlis until the Azerbaijan deputies are elected.' The procession made its way to the post office to send a telegram in the same sense to the Prime Minister. 33. Rezaieh Election. The unsuccessful Tudeh Iran candidate alleges that his successful rival, tfohsin Sadigi Afshar, bribed the Governor- General, Dr. Earzeban, with 150,000 rials to obtain poiiot? a^d gendarmerie support with the electorate. He also asserts that no voting boxes were sent to the Kurdish districts. 34 . A Prophet is not without Honour ..... Kmsravi, u Tabriz!, editor of the Tehran paper t Paroham’, claims to be the prophet oi a new revelation and that the tine has come to acrap the old religious books, including the Koran. Hie sect, known as the f Azerdagan , hab some adherents in Tabriz and a few days ago at one of their meetings thev ceremonially burnt two venerated Moslem books. The news spread, fanaticism was aroused and Yahya Xalami, the member ot ^He sect responsible for the burning, was set on in the market on the 14*n instant by « crowd who would have done him to death had he not been able to take refuge in a caravanserai, where he was hidden until the police came to give him the greater security of a police station. The crowd also sacked the meeting room of the sect, general spread tnrough the bazaars ana merchants fsariag a riot closed tneii shops. 3b. Russian Aifalrs. Major-General GlinsKi Michael Yusefovlch has replaced General Gaidukov as commander of the troops He was to have occupied u large house In the oeutre J 1 ms hastily requisitioned for him, but has now taken the l0 ™^ n0hfrench Consulate. Before quitting the last tenant, a Polish Jew, removed the oath and lavatory aa hie personal property but left the 1 electric bells as e gesture of friendship to the Puasians. There is no doubt that the Puseieas are still trying to find considerable auditionel soeotmnod*tion in Tabriz, both by requisition ing and renting. Some of the houses taken *r* already occupied by officers* families and others by women troops. Armenian families are also letting rooias at high rentals. Occupants of reouiaitioned houses have in aoiae cases been summarily ejected and have suffered considerable hardship. In others appeals against ejection have met with success. JUoh merchants having summer housea on the outskirts of the town are busily re&amp;oving windows and doors by night to discourage the Thiasians from occupying then. The Ueixikil crop of minor in clients has occurred. Two Persians, former refugees from Soviet Russia, have been arrested for varioua robberies which they perpetrated disguised aa Ruaalan officers. A lereian ras been shot dema by Soviet soldiera while in the notion of pillaging « lorry. T*fc Boviet soldiers have been beaten up for assaulting a Moslem woman. Further complaints have also bean receiv ed from thtfc villages about tree-felling for firewood. Vary places nave been almost denuded. 06 . British Military Couvopc . Two convoys of about thirty truoka each continue to arrive almost daily. The organisation at Tabriz has been further improved by the separation of operational from administrative duties. The former reviain in charge of Captain Siuieeraon, while an Indian officer, Captain J/old, has arrived with 15 Indian other ranks to take over the staging nost arrangements. The Indian oersonnel of the convoys are now comfortably housed during their two nays stay here. They are also to be provideo with cineiua performances and 0 canteen, winter on the convoy route is particularly hard for these Indian troops, taaay of whom suffer intensely from the cold, and the additional care for their well-being at Tabriz and elsewhere on the route is a well-merited t’ewaro for eood work under adverse conditions and should result in greater efficiency. It is already resulting in improved discipline. The dumps at Tabriz station have been elmost oorapletely cleared curing the past three weeks and lorries are now being unloaded with the utmost expedition, often direct into railway waggons. The rolling stock pot?ition appears to have improved in a remarkable Tn&amp;n&amp;jr and a number of captured ‘'Tench and German waggons have made their welcome appearance. Lieut.Col. Fdgell, commanding the 16th L. of C., paid a visit of inspection to Tabriz from February 11th - l*th. He vras also spending one night at each staging post on the route. 37. U.K.C.C. Convoys. Arrivals of U.K.C.C. trucks have somewhat fallen off owing to a renewed partial diversion of traffic to Fahlevi. Complaints continue to be rtetived by the locel manager of the treatment raetetf out to drivers by Russian convoy personas! o.u the route. Some of the stories are purest phantasy, one driver, for example, reporting that the driver and mate of a contract truck had been beheaded by Russian soldiers at Bostanabad and that a passing British military convoy had witnessed the incident, arrested the Russians and was bringing them uador military to Tabriz. It is clear that many incidents trise out of accidents end, in reporting one clear case to the Soviet Consul-General, it has been suggested that there should be a clear understanding on both sides as to the correct procedure to bt, followed in such cases. Colonel Schell has also stated that his only complaint about the treatment of British military convoys by Soviet personnel is the tendency of the latter to brandish arms when accidents occur. He too would oe glad to see this question of proper procedure settle:! a$ otherwise the forbearance of some British drivers (vtic are likewise ar.u«ct, but more discreetly 30) may be stretched to breaking point and serious Inoidenta ensue. 38.

Tehran Gonierence. From Saturday, November 27th, to Friday, \ December Grd, there was no telegraphic communication with Tehran^ although the line was in operation as far as iCazvin. At first this was ascribed to technical reasons, but on ^onday the 29th the fact of the conference as the real cause becaiae widely known. In the meantime there had been various rumours of troubles in Tehran. Persian pride has been greatly flattered that the conference should be taking place in Iran. Great results are expected;and my Soviet colleague clearly feels optimistic about its outcome, especially in view of the success of the prelixiiinary talks in Moscow/ Combined with the iniituence of Ankara broadcasts regarding German peace prop osals through tne Vatican there is a feeling that the war is now in its final phase. One result has been to check speculation (although other factors are also at work) and business is stagnant, nominal wholesale prices being from 5 to 30;^ lower without buyers or sellwrs* 223. Food bituation. It is common ground that the harvest has been the best for years and that the stocks are sufficient to meet all the requirements of the local population, the Russians and also Tehran. Russian requirements in wheat have, in fact, already been satisfied and the balance of 2,600 tons of barley will present no difficulty, bocal requirements will also be covered, but no proper provision has yet been made for Tehran. The Director of Finance, wno, as already reported in Tabriz Diary ho.16 Fara.183, is now in control of the Kharbar Department, informed me on November 30th that he expects to obtain 60,000 tons of wheat at the controlled price, estimates of 80,000 tons will be falsified as the assessments were made on the basis of an out-of- date survey, undertakings to supply 53,000 tons have already been entered into. The gloomy side of the picture is, however, that Tabriz itself has barely a week's supply of wheat in hand, the present stock being 400 tons divided between the silo and the mill with a daily consumpt ion of 63 tons, to which it has been reduced from 75 tons. To keep Tabriz t.oing therefore requires a considerable proportion of the available transport, particularly as the grain in the immediate vicinity has now been collected and hauls are getting longer. Road transport is trie crux of the situation. The Road Transport board at Tabriz, now also under the Director of Finance, has 114 lorries, but they have hitherto been for the most part improperly used and shockingly maintained. Their drivers are entirely un disciplined and it is difficult to exert any authority over them. ^ost of the lorrios are at present reported to be'under repair'. In many cases this is false, the drivers using them meantime for their own profit. To remedy this state of affairs the Director of Finance is initiating a plan for sealing all lorries under repair and has requested Russian co-operation in supervising the use of such lorries as are on the road. Of the 40 trucks first supplied by Tehran specifically for the collection of this year's grain only eleven are now in running order, the remainder having been seriously damaged through improper usa^e, drivers having often, among other irregularities, carried a double lo^d, the excess bein^ for their own account. There still remain la good ora«r, however, the majority of the 60 trucks sent later by Tehran. The need for the further 60 since promised is, it will be seen, very pressing if any eubstantienal progress towards aoouamlatipn of stocks is to be made before winter 1n - xne director of if nance gives the Impression of tointa'h!’ ■ ♦ in very difficult circumstances with a personnel which is^ORtl/ 98 * “b. banned from toe fact that he is credibly supposed to have I tlESa. 0 ^ DZ&amp; a/' /amassed - ^&gt;^0 J —ilG amassca 2,000,000 rials ir: zhe very short time he wac in charge of t ae Oepartmeno • let, notv.i tas uandih^^iot oriety of his conduct, he has since received a lucrative Governinent appointment in Tehran, uiome oi the subordinate officials of the Department appointed by Tehran are also well-known peculators, Shahbandi head of Supply department at Rezaieh being the most outstanding figure in this category, or. i»iajidzad6h complains that in other directions too isnot receiving proper support from Tehran, he cannot, for example, obtain tyres for his inspectors' cars; sacks indented for have not been supplied: necessary credits nave not been provided. r , iiie best nope that Dr. xuajidzadeh seemed to hold out for i^hran was tnat it might eventually be furnished with wneat from mianen. he has already sent Inspectors there to estimate the local requirements and when this nas been done the surplus will be made available.

From August 20th to August 25th V /rain iell eveiy day, hut as tne narvests had heeii almost ent irely ■^ataered in, little iiarm was ao;ie* aince then t..ere has been a con tinued spell of beautiful weather with a distinct autumn nip in the evenings and early morning. 171.

It is to be hoped that tneir optimism is justified as otherwise it is difficult to see how serious trouble during the winter can be avoided. The mdari darbari Rah at present dis oses of 100 contracted lorries and 50 lorries from the Iranian Government pool. The opposition to the inci’ease in tne price of bread, fore shadowed in paragraph 158 of this diary, was strong en ugh to induce the local authorities to drop the proposal. The quality of the oread has also slightly improved. ^eat has increased in price by 2b,.. during the past week and butter by 16/. 8u t .ar has gone up to rials 140 per kilo for soft sugar and rials 150 for l^al stgar. ood and charcoal continue to rise owing to the considerable Russian purexiases and to the lack of transport. Th© Russians ire re orted to have told tue Director of the Kharuar Department that as he appears unable to collect sufficient wheat they will colic ct tue. is elves for their own requirements and they arc said to be already making purchases in the villages for cash. The Director of hharbar has now gone to *..ianduab and mahaoad to ob tain unuertakings iro^ tl© Aurdish land-owners there, but his chances of success seem doubtful. 175. Qommunications The storms mentioned above caused a number of road-blocks on the Tasriz-Teiiran road, but these were rapidly dealt v/ith by the Royal engineers and no serious damage was done nor were communications helc or any length oi time. Neither of the storms toucioed the ghibli pass so tixat the work tnere has not'been interrupted. The Russians have now instituted a control at the K&amp;flan Kuh bridge as well as at v»iiibli. Telegraphic communication with Tehran was interrupted by storm damage, but was restored &gt;vitnin 24 hours. K o co n •q O rn c t m r i 174. Transport As a result of th© request addressed to Mm by this Consul at e-General (paragraph 160 of this diary) the Governor-General iias given instructions that the Julfa and maragha roads are to be closed to UKCC vehicles unless these are providea witii a special permit si. ned by t**© manager of the UAGG in Tabriz. The illegal loua oi wim*at which was seized on tie maragha road whan being trans ported in a bi-DC truck and harxded over by the manager to the .iieat department, has now been given sack to the owner on instructions from the Famandar, acting on behalf of the Governor-General. It is not i quite clear Wiiat th© position oi the 5AGO now is in tne matter. With ordinary illegal back-loads they nomally hold the goods until the /owner CO^iaJL ;ney /Z2_ '&amp;****. - S'* /S^tky Jh ? Sts.*:. «. jam (4cx&gt;) ' 3. owner pays a sum equal to ten times tne t'reiLht charges* In tills ease it v;as considered that in view of the shortage of wheat in Tabriz the correct course was to hand it over to the Wheat Department. Why the authorities aid not keep this wheat, so urgently needed in town, and pay the owner for it at tne official Government price, is heyond comprehension, and one is forced to suspect collusion between the owner and the authorities. Meanwhile the manager of the UKGC is ^pointing out to the authorities that the Jorporation has a claim for ^ who wear and tear of their t^res and that lie is referring the matter to lehran for instructions* On August 2bth the UhJG manager, ^r. Pay, having reason to suspect that trucks were using the Anar road for illegal traffic, himself went out at night ulon*, the road and was successful in catching four trucks returning from Aiiar with loads of wheat, rice, charcoal, apples, e 0 gs ana carpets* iien ^r. Day nad not returned the follow ing morning, tlie fact was report, ed to this Consulate-General and Colonel hdgell, who happened to ue staying here, kindly lent his car which was sent out with Mr* Day’s assistant and two British soldiers* They found Mr. Da/ surrounded by a numoer of irate track-drivers and their equally irate customers and were fortunately in time to prevent what might have Jten an ugly scene. At tue subsequent enquiry * r.Day elicited the information that a certain Akbar Anoari had been acting as a go-between for the drivers of the vehicles and the consignors of tiv illegal loads* Also taat me officer in charge of the gendarmerie at Ahar had been acting in a similar capacity at that end whilst an unknown person in Ahar had been falsely representing himself to be the a.ent of the UhCC. Again on August S7th, another UKCC truck illegally back-loading wheat overturned on the same road and was badly damaged• All the above facts were reported officially by this Consulate- general to the Governor-General with the request that the local authorities should also put the idiar road out of bounds to UK.CC vehicles. If the gendarraerie officer is found to be implicated in the traffic, it is proposed to ask the Governor-General to remove him to some post where less temptation will be put in his way. unce a^ain it must dc pointed out that this illegal traffic will continue until the UhCJ is allowed to &gt;,ack-load afflotally axxd so help 1 to relieve the coxigestion of goods for which totally insufficient trans port is available. Presumably ta© over-riding considerations adduced by the Co manner-in-Chief against tne proposal still hold good since nothing further has been heard of the natter, although General Townall spent several days in Tehran towards the end of July and, no doubt, I went into the question then on the spot. It is £incei\.ly to be hoped that this problem will not be shelved and that if, at any time, the situation justifies a change of policy, this will be put into effect without delay. Meanwhile, Mr* Day and ills very small staff are battling nobly and conscientiously against the illegal traffic at no inconsiderable r^-sk to themselves* Dacal Government The recall of Serlashkar ^aqaddam, the Governor-General, nas raised quite a local storm. It is generally believed tuat it nas come aoout as a result of the criticisms of Deputy Tabatabai in the Majlis on August 15th against the manner in which the elections were being organised in iauriz* The exact date on which the Governor-General received his in structions to go to Tehran is not known, but there is good reason to ueiieve that he suppressed the news as long as ossicle axid meanwhile rallied his supporters and organised demonstrations to take place when the news of his recall became known* On August 30th two of General ^uqaddam’s chief supporters, Jurabchi and Calcuttachi, both well-known industrialists and candidates for the ... ajlis (gossip says they each paid the Govern or-General 100,000 rials for supporting their candidature) induced the bazaars to close on the pretext that the Governor-General was being recalled to Tehran because he had been /insisting3. &gt; A lalt't Vepsrls c Yecclioi' 1 • insisuiag tixat tiie broad and sugar rations in Tabriz should be QQUal to those in xeuran* A meeting ^as held in the bazaar mosque and speeches praising the Goveraor-dcneral were made* In the alternoon the opposition to General ^uqaddam entered tne lists and posted pamphlets all over trie town openly accusing him of corrupt practices and maladministration. Xt was suggested tnat tne Governor—Genai* al was trying out his -K strength with the idea of openly flouting the Government. If this weue . J 1 so 5 he cannot have been much encouraged by the results achieved by his manoeuvres. tfhat he has succeeded in doing is to,unite - even though it will probably be only temporarily - the most curious assortment of political opinionsi whose only common ground is dislike of General muqaadaia and the old tradition of political despotism and corruption which, in their eyes, he represents. Five different groups have joined together to form a oarty called the ’Free Front \ They are the Tudeh Iran, the Azerbaijan Liberals, the Anti—Fascist Party, tne Viiorhers ‘ Union and the Iran hidar. That Iran Bidar, pro-German in every way and anti-democratic, can be f ound in the same camp as tiie workers* Union which is Communist in outlook, can only be explained by the fact that the political ideas of these parties are so hebulous that their common dislike of the Governor-General transcends any political ideology to which they have vaguely hitched themselves. This unexpected coalition, however temporary, of the parties which singly were of snail account, has knocked General huqaddam completely off his perch and even his 'faithful* supporters are going to ground before the approaching; storm. There are also signs that the General himself is preparing to bow to the inevitable and to go whilst the going ie good. Tiie elections have meanwhile been postponed pending, it is said tie arrival of an inspector from the Ministry of the Interior. Kumour is naturally rife regarding General ..*iuqaddam's successor* It is said that tiie post had been offered to tfawad Amery, a former Minister of tie Interior, but that he nad refused it. The latest candidate is reported to be Shahzadeh Mahvi. On September 3rd. several arrests were made in Tabriz on orders irom Tehran- Of these the most important were the prosecutor- General, humid -.»ujtanidi and Ingelab, the labour leader who was ex pelled from Azerbaijan last .ear* Both the arrests have caused some stir. In the case of the former,the head of tiie Department of Justice and the Judges have wired to Tehran to say that the courts cannot continue to function under tne circumstances. It is under stood that the main objection to the arrest, is one of form, the judicial department maintaining that the correct procedure was for the Prosecutor-General to be dismissed from his post and then arrested. Ingelab, who had returned to Tabriz some ten days ago, is reported to iiave attempted to take refuge in the Soviet Consulate- General, where, however, he was told tnat they could not help him. He was subsequently taken to the Farmandar who is said to have given him twenty-four hours in whiefe to quit the province. On September 5th the town was seething with rumours of mass arrests in Tehran, the numbers of which were variously quoted as anything from 170 to 400, including members of tne ^ajiis and high- ranking military officers* The arrests in Tabriz were, not un naturally connected in the minds of the public with the events in Tehm . Whether any such connection does exist or not is difficult to say' as, up to the time of writing, no official information has been received. It is said taut the B.ii.C. broadcast a state .ent about tae allayed arrests, but as this Consulate—General possesses 1 Xl ° wireless set, it has not been possible either to conf irm or dery the reports which have been circulated. Generally speaking, it is correct to say that the stories of tiie arrests have produced little excitement, and vnen the names of those arrested are made public, as they must be within a short space of time, the effect may be very salutary. Gemsular .collcaea Tne Soviet Gousul-General, who has been / awayaway since tne midtile oi July, was expected back from Moscow on 1st September, but he has not yet arrived,* labour The unrest reported in paragraph 136 of this diary has ^led down owing to various steps taken by the employers to meet the Workers* demands. With the cost of living still on the Increase, however, these concessions can only be palliatives and it is unlikely that the present peaceful state of affairs will last for long* on September 1st the Workers 9 Union held a public meeting to celeorate their first anniversary* The euief speaker was Khalil Ingelab and it must be admitted to his credit that what he said was sensible* he pointed out the absurdity of crops in plenty and starving people in the towns. He asked why the sugar ration in Tehran should be 7Q0 grammes and in Taoris only 300. He threw a few bricks at the Director of jiducation and at the Director of Public health, accusing the one of letting trie teachers go barefoot and hungry without taking up cudgels on their behalf with the central government, and the other, of remaining indifferent to the lamentable state of the hospitals and so-called public health services whilst the poor were dying without medicines or medical attention being available, finally,he said that the reactionary elements which had caused the bazaars to close a few days previously, had done so with tins object of inciting the workers to loot and so discredit themselves. He warned the workers against civil disorder and told them that their ends would not be served by such means and enjoined courage and steadfastness in their views which would, in the end, triumph* i 178* x-ropflffi|p&lt;frp The British landing in Italy has produced a very [ marked effect on public opinion. The very fact that there was in Azerbaijan such admiration for the armed might of Germany and such profound belief in her invincibility has given an added lustre to the brilliant Allied victories of the past few months. There are signs that this admiration is now being accorded in increasing measure to the Lillies and less grudgingly than a short while ago. Greater [interest is being shown in things British and it is hoped to do quite quite a nice little trade in the publicity shop with the recent con signment of books sent up by the Public Relations Bureau. The cash register is a good index to jmblic feeling* 3gd. i.C. Ogden Acting Gonsul-General British Consulate-General, TABRIZ.

Minister,j British Legation, Tehran.2 (fan others, some are useless, while the Russians are supposed to be hostile to Farshi, Isfahan! and Isfahanian. They are thought to be hostile also to Afshar, the present deputy from Rezaieh. 5. Mr. Jurabchi states that there may be something like 200 candi dates for the 19 seats allotted to Azerbaijan. He says that the Governor-General, now in Tehran, has had many requests for support from would-be candidates there, and I have no doubt that many of 'them are merchants and absentee landlords who left Tabriz when the (ussians came. They may wish to become deputies partly because trade is dull and they have little to do, partly because they wish to !iake a stand against the 'menace^ of communism. 6. The following are the groups apparent here at this stage a) The industrialists, landlords, merchants and propertied classes generally. They have no official political organisation, and at the moment it looks as if far too many candidates will come forward from this section of the population. b) Tudeh Iran - local leader All Amiri Khizi. This group has the support of Mohammed Ali Akhbari, editor of the newspaper w Goftar ve Kirdar ,f , but for lack of funds the paper is not appearing at present. The aims of this party are as prescribed by the head quarters in Tehran. °) Iran Bidar - led by Hussein Guli Katibi, editor of the w Fariad M newspaper. He has a following among doctors, young men with pretensions to education, end some merchants; a sort of in telligentsia, who proclaim that Iran must awake. I enclose the translation of a recent article from the 'Fariad*. d) Azadi Khakhan - liberal party led by the old agitator Sar- tib Zadeh, who for a brief period was, or claimed to be, the leader hereof Tudeh Iran until displaced by Ali Amiri Khizi. He has the support of the M Sahend” newspaper, whose editor, Habib Aghazadeh, is still a fugitive in Tehran, having been markedly pro-German. The paper now advocates democracy. The Labour Union - The present leader is Mutallib Latifi. There is a strong Caucasian tinge about this group; they make much of being anti-fascist, and are thought to have close contacts with the Russians. I enclose the translation of a manifesto which they have just distributed in leaflet form. 7. Of these groups the Tudeh is best organised and it is showing its greatest activity in Sastern Azerbaijan. It is reported to have representatives in Sarab, Ardebil, Mishkinshahr, Marand, and to be holding meetings in these and smaller towns. This is natural,, because in this area a great number of the male workers have had contact with Russians and have thereby satis been made more recentive of modern or even revolutionary ideas. As you know, there was, until Reza Shah stopped it, a movement from Azerbaijan into the Caucasus of labourers who worked there to accumulate a few hundred gold roubles and then return. Then there are the ’’refugees”, those Persian subjects who spent years in Russia, learned the language, married Russian women, and so on. Although they had little reason to be grateful to the Russians they found it hard to content themselves with the bleak prospect of life in Persia. If there is any material fit for social revolution in this country, it is among these men in Eastern Azerbaijan; but they are nowhere compact, scattered as they are over a mainly agricultural or pastoral area. Moreover, I am told, they and the peasantry generally jumped to the conclusion when the Russians arrived that the lana would be divided among them forthwith, and you will recollect some agitation in the villages against landlords immediately after the occupation; but instead of a division of land there has been, in Eastern Azerbaijan, &amp; gradual restoration of Persian authority, the reappearance of soldiers, gendarmes and officials. So these Russian-minded Persians, and the peasantry generally, are disillusioned, and inclined to be sceptical of the promises of the Tudeh speakers, even when they hint that they have /powerful3 powerful support for their progressiYe policy. Also, the peasants haye had time to ponder, and while ready to preb anything they can in unsettled times, they are not prepared to accept communism in cold blood. Most of them are religious fanatics, and only a yery little above their animals in intelligence. Thus there are many landlords who feel confident that they can handle the peasants despite political agitation, by an appeal to religious prejudice, or the well-timed gift of a little grain. The town workers, particularly the factory workers of Tabriz, may prove less amenable, and it is that possibility together with the fear of Russian intervention, which alarms l£r. Jurabohi and his fellow capitalists. I think, however, that these fears are exaggerated* 8. In Western Azerbaijan there is scarcely any political activity at present. The parties which sprouted so quickly in Rezaieh when the Russians arrived have died out. Only in Mandouab has one Tudeh speaker been heard so far. Here too landlords seem to have confidence that they can menage affairs more or less in the old way. 9. From immediate election problems my discussion with l£r• Jurabchi ranged over general topics. I told Mr. Jurabehi that if I were a Persian I would pay less attention to the bogey of Russian intervention and more to the actual conditions in the country. I had begun to say that twenty-five years ago the peasant had a second coat to go to market in, e few tomans to splash et his son’s wedding, whereas now he had nothing, when Mr. Jursbohi took the tale from my mouth and gave his version of ho* the government monopolies had impoverished the peasant by making him pay more for his sugar, tea end cloth, and ruined thousands of small traders when the big companies were formed. The result was that t e rich who participated in the various companies have become richer and the poor poorer. Indeed ha said Persia now presented the condi tions which Len*n said were pre-requisite for revolution, and he reeled off a list of contrasting prices, past and present, to illustrate the hardships of the ordinary citizen; but he was anxious to prove that the division of wealth would be fatal, and he seemed to think that the left-wing parties were quite capable of that excess if once they got the power. He has the poorest opinion of his fellow countrymen; they work, he says, just as much as they are made to work by the employers and landlords, and if a peasant were once given his share of the land and had the present compulsions removed he would spend his whole day at ease beneath the bough, to the ruin of fctx agriculture. 10. Squally definite were his opinions of the Russians. They were, he said, at present benefiting from an entirely false contrast between the behaviour of their troops and, for example, the Americans, who drank and committed various follies; but he thought the Russians concealed beneath their disciplined attitude a policy dangerous for Iran in the long run. The iinmediate future Uould, he believed, show that they intend to pack the Majlis with men favourable to them, so far as they couJd do so in their zone, as a first step towards detaching Azerbaijan. 11. We shall see; and what we shall see may be a clue to what you have called the 'Russian enigma' in this country. Meantime, although I have had to record Mr. Jurabchi’s views, bfcing typical of the outlook of the industrialists here, I have no intention of being influenced by them in the slightest. In the first place they are exaggerated; in the second, it is particularly necessary at this stage that no British representative here sh ouid say or do anything which, if repeated to the Russians, might incite them to interven tion in the election procedure in order to offset some supposed British activity. 3o I gave Mr. Jurabchi little comfort; I did not directly rebuff him, but I did reject the implications that the Russian government is plotting to detach Azerbaijan, that Russia will not honour her treaty obligations.

The telephone line which has been pulled down by the Kurds between ^ianduab and Wahab^id is in process of being restored. 13i * Supplies to uasia ♦ The flow of British military convoys ; }ms been resumed. Convoy commanders report a remarkable change in ^ the attitude of Russians generally, both on the reed and in Tabriz, ^ ; jiil nee i',e capture of Tunisia. The Russian drivers even wave in /friendly fashion to our drtvere when passing on the road* 132. The Food Situation in Tabriz has deteriorated. The ration of bread at the controlled prices has been halved and often it has ailmost been uneoUble. .in the result, those who can afford it have been selling their ration to buy better bread at uncontrolled prices; but this too has deteriorated in quality and it seems th t there is a genuine short&amp;f'e of wheat. People are grumbling, discreetr that the Russians are taking it away. To some extent this is true. The Russians are quietly insisting on further deliveries wheat and barley in Azerbaijan, and although they are still a long way from getting the whole of the 20,000 tons of wheat and barley promised by the Persian Government ooo l® 8 * y* 4 *** raust by now have received something like 15,000. VVic end ©£ ^ut t'e re^l explanation of the shortage is that large stocks were hoarded in districts remote from the few motor&amp;ble roads, and it Aj. remain** hoarded through the winter instead of being moved steadily forward to points accessible to motor lorries. The stock holders are now willing enough to iell, or exchangee for sa^«r, but there Just isn’t enough animal transport to move it forward fast enough to keep the town end the Russian* fully supplied. The motor transport is not now the bottle-neck; the lorries have emptied all the accessible grain stores. Russian purchases of other foodstuffs, butter, vegetables, sheep, cattle and of course, wood and charcoal, continue on # a xafge scale and people generally know perfectly well that they ere responsible for soaring prices; but the Russians are getting away with it for the time being in a marvellous way. They get a flaring publicity for the wheat which they bring in to Tehran via the Caspian, but not a word la said about the quantities of Persian ^ u ' a1 barley which theatre consuming; here; it is widely stated tvat, thanks to the Russians, food conditions are better here than in the south, but nobody ventures to point to the large and continuing purchase of foodstuffs and fuel; the newspapers thank them for helping in the fight against locusts, whereas, no one but a few officials know that they did not keep their promise to supply transport. The facts will prevail in the end, and indeed I think that already the Russians have peaked the orest of the wave of their recent popularity. I1: s««sis that the Russians decided that it would be a good thing to prevent the Herki from Iraq from making their customary purchases of sheep in we stern Azerbaijan, but I ws&amp; told in •rihabud the other ay that the Russian embargo was not effective; the Herki are buying sheep pretty much as usual. 153. R oopl government . The Governor General summoned to Tehran Tabriz on the 18th still a sick man, and most people felt that v. e chances were against his coming back; but he in coming beck, and on the whole I think it is better so. Much of the criticism against him in Tehran was unfounded; tiany of hia critics were interecsted parties w^o, like the industrialists in Tabriz and the propertied classes generally, resent his good relations with the Russians and his contacts with leaders of the leftist grouns. The man hap a difficult job; good relations with the Russians are essential if he is to carry it out properly. I certainly think h© ought to be given reasonable latitude in the performance of it. Obviously, if the *ndustrialists were to approve of him entirely he would not be showing that Impartiality which is desirable in a Governor General. Again, some Tabrizis try from time to time to ©afccite me against him by saying that he is entirely in the pockets /of theof the Russians, but I haTe no complaint. It is natural he should hare more to do with the Russians than with me. IVhen I do have to see him he is courteous and as helpful as one can expect. I have no doubt that in the south our consuls see the local authorities oftener than do Russian consuls. I found in Wehabad confirmation of the rumours that the Governor General has been making money out of the sugar for wheat exchange. A prominent Kurd told me there that considerable quantities of sugar have been handed out to the tribes for wheat, but only to those who were able to bribe the Governor General's representatives. 134. Local ?oilt lo;** A certSin amount of election excitement is now developing in 'fabrix, and in some districts of eastern Azerbaijan Tudeh party speakers have been active} but elsewhere there is still nothing doing. Azerbaijan returns 21 deputies including one Kurd and one Armenian representative. For the 19 ordinary seats it looks at present as if there will be something like 200 candidates. There is the usual broad division between the conservatives and the progressives. Among the conservatives the industrialists are the mist nervous. They fear that the relatively compact groups of factory workers may be organised to support a communist policy. The landlords are less nervous being fairly confident that the majority of the peasants will continue to follow their lead. In these propertied classes there is no official oolitical organisation, and too many want to get to the MajlAs to make a stand against the 'Menace of Communism', i.e. to protect and increase their private fortunes. There are four main groups of progressives: The Tudeh-Iran Iran-Bld&amp;r Liberals Labour Union. They are all rivals, but there is some attempt at organisation within their renks, notably in Tudeh-Iran. The propertied class generally profess to think that the fcssians will try to cook the elections and pack the Majlis, but their feers ere, in my opinion, exaggerated. These coming elections will b© very interesting; we shall see tjust how far the Russians may try to further their ends, how far communist doctrine will appeal. My forecast is that they will interfere much less than is aAOOcted,!provided always they don't get it into their heads that *0 &lt;vre rigging the eleotional and that ao?sraunistiG doctrine will not appeal at all to the electors. 133. public Security . The calm continues. Uobody really pays much attention to an occasional bit of sheep stealing on the Turkish frontier. Driving in the neighbourhood of Kezaieh last week-end I marvelled to aee viliages.battered end deserted when I last visited them in May 1942, now teeming with people and animals, all busy with the harvest. This lax Sovietica is no mean achievement. Cut in the open country I encountered Kurds carrying their rifles, as one does in the Kurdish districts of Iraq, but in Rezaieh itself it is new forbidden to Kurds to swagger about armed as they were doing a year ago. Colonel Schwarzkopf, /oiericaa adviser to the gendarmerie, has toured Azerbaijan. He said before setting out from Tabriz that ho had found the Russians here helpful and that they had even suggested additional places to be added to his itinerary. In western Azerbaijan however when he set out south from Rez&amp;ieh he was turned back by the Russian post at Hyderabad beoapae he had omitted to obtain a pass for that section of his tour. He got one of course for the asking in Hezaieh and carried out hia tour as planned. The stiff attitude of this post may be aue to the fact that a British party came into the Russian zone from Iraq without passes a week or two earlier; the Russian road posts hesitated to turn them back, but I have little doubt they have now had orders hot to use discretion in future. 136. Consular Coileaucues. The Soviet Consul General announced ' 1 ''-T-r i ■ . “T~ Ji 4.V. at4k • towards the end of June, that he was appointed Soviet ambassador to Mongolia and would leave for Ulan-bator early in July. As I write however, he has just informed me that this has been counter manded end that he may remain in Persia, either in Tehran or Tabriz; but he must first go to Moscow and will leave by air on July 12th. The Iraqi’s Vice Consul’s fears have been Justified (see para 102) His sucessor has pulled strings in Baghdad and obtained better post than Tabriz. &gt; / The U.S. Consul held a reception on July 5th. He was I horrified to discover that his munshi was explaining to guests that , he was celebrating the defeat of the British by the Americans. 137 . Public Health The Russians are reported to have inoculated against typhoid some 30,000 people in Tabriz, i.e. l/6th of the population only. They give the inoculation in one large shot, so that reactions are generally fierce., therefore the operation is not popular and they havo had to use a good deal of compulsion. Their certificates have consequently been selling at good prices. In theory they have inoculated the inhabitants of other towns, but I found in Western Azerbaijan that it was a token performance only; a very few had been treated. By radio and other ways they have claimed merit for doing this, which is a great mistake. Quite a number of Persians understand that any military commander must concern himself with the health of the local population and forestall any threatened epidemic in his own military interest; so they are not impressed, while the more ignorant section of the community just hates inoculation. I 38 * Labour All remains quiet. The manager of the Iran Leather factory tells me that the present head of the Labour Union is a very reasonable fellow and that the officials appointed in the various factories have all aceepted a rise in salary as the price of not making trouble. This informant states that in labour matters the Russians remain scrupulously neutral as between employers and men. 139. Military The Russians moved some 2,000 cavalry with some 40 truck loads of impedimenta westward from Tabriz to Mahabad, 300 of them to some point in the Bokan. At the same time they were re ported to have moved troops south from Rezaieh and to have replaced them with others from Salmas. But when I passed through Mahabad on July 4th, I foudd that they had all gone, having stayed for 5 days only. There is no official explanation of this move to Mahabad and the sudden withdrawal. It seems certain they intended to stay for some time because they had asked the local authorities to repair the barracks and they gave themselves considerable trouble in bringing furniture etc. It may be that they were merely trying to find a camping place where grain could be more easily obtained than in Tabriz. Persian The Persian Colonel commanding in Rezaieh marched as many of his 600 men as could be accommodated to the cinema for a special showing of 'Desert Victory'. The men seemed to be in good shape. 140. Trade The typical Tabriz! merchant wears no collar, and often shuffles to his office in heelless slippers; but as a class these.merchants are astute and powerful and Dr. Millspaugh will find thaT^fnertia and power of rtsistance are great. It is said that some^of them are busy preparing new books to present to Millspaugh’s /tax inspectors should his income/proposals become law; but they will not rely on that sort of subterfuge only. They are confident he will not find officials to enforce the regulations against them; the | feeling is growing that he is working in isolation. The more i ambitious his plans for a sweeping reform of the finances of Persia, j the more certain do people here feel he is bound to fail. The Russian banfon the export of food stuffs apart from eggs and cheese only, is still maintained, and there is no out let for the great quantities of dried fruits and almonds except sale to the Russians and by smuggling.

The dorpmentary was in Persian which spoilt the film somewhat for the British and Russians. By the use of a specially printed Russian commentary however, we were able to ensure that none of the important points was missed, and the film, generally, had an excellent effect. jpeoial showings were given in Tabriz and Bezaieh to notables, military and civilian. In Tabriz the Persian notables received it rather coldly; indeed the military officers seemed stunned, to the Joy of the local civilians, who have great contempt for the Farsi military man. In Rezaieh one Persian officer reacted against this impression and was heard explaining that the whole thing was e fake, that war was not fought in this way. I related this incident to Ohazl Mohamad of Mahatoad in order to forestall the possibility of similar talk in Mahabnd; he saw it from a different angle and his laugi&amp;was rich and sust ined at the mere Idea of a Persian officer saying what was, and what was not, war.

Between July 2nd and 4th 1 made a circuit df Lake Urumieh from north to south. The harvest was Just getting into swing and it was good to see fine cro^s almost everywhere, although there was short stuff on some hillsides where the soil is thin. In the Rezaie# plain, which is of course especially fertile, I saw wheat being cut which must be as good as can be found anywhere, fine upstanding stems, heavy-headed and thick on the ground. The Kurds in Mahabad used the same refrain; of the various crops in Kurdistan all are good. A Tabriz story that insects were ruining^suger beet crop was found to be grossly exaggerated. The damage is small, so far. There is to be an Agricultural Exhibition in Tabriz this autumn where crops, machinery, methods and so forth will be demon* at t at*•.d. It is booed to attract an attendance from all over Azerbaijan. A year ago the last Governor General assured me that the Russians had purchased so many animals of all kinds that the peasants would not be able to perform all their agriculture work. This has been proved untrue, since the peasants subsequently cultivated a record harvest. But the Russians hove gone on purchasing horses, donkeys and cuttle and. I am agdin told that the peasants have over sold. I should say there is some truth in the statement now. One landlord tells me that it is desired to demonstrate at the forth coming exhibition light ploughs which can be drawn by one animal instead of two, so as to ensur t that ploughing will not suffer. ixr^ ,J? h ? x 1 ;ly af ? or 1 wrote Pa™.112 of ray Diary No.10, I learned ^ that otliOAfcls notices had been issued from Tabriz ordering landlords and peasants to hold themselves ready to provide the information required for the assessment of the harvest. Groups of officials were subsequently sent out to collect the information, but they had little success anywhere and three Karadagh villages rose to chase them away, i understand that towards the end of J^ne a telegram was sent to Tehran saying that the project of estimating the harvest in advance tfould have to be abandoned. Elsewhere nothing at all seems *tofcave been attempted. ^°* Coramunioations. Between July 2nd and 4th I traversed over of ver K bfi&lt;i roads.

Several gongs of labourers under Russian military supervision were working hard on the road between Tabriz and ^arand, that is, on the main Russian line of eorminications to the north. Elsewhere nothing was being done and the rood from Mahabad to Tabriz in particular was abominable.

British Consulate-General, Tabriz, 8th June, 1943« SISCRBT, Sir, 4 f 1 9 '-S-. ft With reference to my despatch Uo« 29« 1 have the honour to submit a further memorandum by Mr. Vice-Consul Ogden, setting forth general impressions formed on his recent visit to Rezaieh* ’ sv 2* I have already, in my despatc h ho» 29&gt; commented on the good behaviour and apparent contentment 'of the Kurds# I commend as very interesting ^r# Ogden’s point about the black-coat workers having, many of them, small properties from which to eke out their admittedly inadequate salaries. You will have seen in the local press suggestions that Dr# Millspaugh’s proposedcomb-out of civil servants should be made with this fact in mind# It certainly is true that in Azerbaijan most townsmen have one foot in the country, that the towns are not genuinely urbanised areas like Tehran, ?/here the majority of the citizens depend on the supplies coming into the shops daily# When the shortage of bread occurred here we discovered that the majority of the citizens had their own reserve of flour and ^ food-stuffs generally# Similarly most men who have saved money (and few civil servants fail to set some money aside sooner or later) hasten to acquire a-bit of land, and this fact makes powerfully for stability# * 1 4# * have already reported the incursion by a British military party, without passes* Such incidents are not, in my view, so likely to damage good relations this year as last, when the military and political situations were shaky in the Caucasus, and when Russian suspicions were very raw indeed# But although less dangerous they ;remain none the less regrettable# We all resent the difficulties about passes which the Russians create; ‘we all* find it hard to understand that they do not allow us the freedom of movement in the north which we allow in the south; but facts have to be faced, and military men on our side ought to be the first to understand that if* the Russian troops have orders to demand passes, the proper procedure is to try to have these orders changed by diplomatic procedure, and not to try to evade them* In any event the 'port' of Hyderabad has been reported on over and over again, and a mixed Anglo-Soviet party went round the lake last September with the express purpose of surveying transport possibilities# That another group should now return to look once more at the single jetty which constitutes the port of Hyderabad and then spend two nights in Rezaieh, and try to go to Salmas, must convey to the Russians, either that our administration, is inefficient, or that some deeper motive lies concealed# They generally tend to choose the latter explanation# They do not understand that our discipline is such that otherwise responsible officers can undertake a jaunt into the Russian zone for no very practical purpose, and in disregard of our general policy of conciliation. « PS. lie low 3* ^r# Ogden states that the Russians are apparently making very little propaganda and his.failure to discover any pamphlets in Kurdish or/ Sir Reader Dullard, K*C#M. G#, C. I. E* H.M# Legation#or Armenian may serve to dispose of the suggestion, which you recently referred to me, that the Russians are inspiring th$ Kurds and other minorities to separatist or nationalist i ambitions by means of printed propaganda* But the fact that the Russians are not following our standard, and largely ineffective, methods of propaganda does not prove that they are not ca£J 2 yii^*/^ on a less obvious but quite effective propaganda. Their fllm^ifiv their concert-parties performing to the public, the generally good behaviour of their troops, above all the good order they have secured (partly by restraining the Persian authorities) have secured them for the time being the fickle esteem of the local population. The gift of &amp; of the wheat harvest to the Russian Red Cross is proof of the s ccess of theii* general policy. 6. In conclusion, it is a pleasure to note that Mr. Ogden met with courtesy from both the local authorities and the Russians. His visits to Rezaieh are, 1 think, very valuable, and he is to be congratulated for having cultivated excellent relations with all concerned. I have, etc. (Signed) R.W. Urquhart. P. S* 7* When I wrote paragraph 4 above I had in mind previous incursions and the attitude of the officers concerned, an,dralso -j^Minbranch telegr am No. 72 to you which stated that the officers had entered the Russian zone without authority from the British military authorities and implied that disciplinary action might be taken. I have today received Minbranch telegram N o. 57 to -sO^Ministate, giving a summary of the Commander-in-^hief f s report to the War Office. In view of his statements I fully withdraw, as regards this particular' Incursion, the implication in my comments that the officers evaded the Russian posts on the Ushnu road and at Hyderabad in order to get to Rezaieh, and I also withdraw the word 'jaunt' as regards this mission. In my telegram No. lull t o you I have dealt with the suggestion that the officers dicflaotenter the Russian zone. 9* X wish to state that if a request for infomation necessary in connexion with a possible opening of the Rowanduz route had been referred to me, I would have done my best to cope with it quickly. I frankly acknowledge that some military requests for information have been of such a nature that I have not been able to deal with them fully or quickly; but I know the Rowanduz route well and could probably answer very easily any question put to me about it. In addition, I must again draw your attention to the fact that the road has been traversed frequently by British military parties since the occupation. 10. On June 8th I raised, in the appendix to my diary, the question of a Russian* speaking assistant. I wish here to emphasise that if the military authorities could see their way to give me the assistance for which I have asked, I would be in a better position to help them quickly when they need information, and they could then refer to me more frequently and perhaps avoid the need for sending parties into the Russian zone. 11. I would also recall the promise made to me that I v/ould receive prior warning of the arrival of such parties. I appreciate that in this case you were yourself probably quite unaware that the trip was being made. (intd.*) r/u; 1 ' 2 * * June 12th, 1943.\ SECRET. SECRET MEMORANDUM. I left Tabriz on May 18th for Rezaieh travelling by train and lake steamer. The time-table has been altered since my last report and the train now leaves Tabriz at 7.30 a.m. and arrives at Sharif Khaneh at 11 a.m. On the return journey the train leaves Sharif Khaneh at 2.30 p.m. arriving at Tabriz at 6 p.m. The days remain the same, namely Tuesdays and Fridays for the outward journey and Sundays and Thursdays for the return journey. 2. The journey was uneventful although I was interested to notice a fair sprinkling of Kurds, well-dressed and opulent- looking, in contrast v/ith the rest of the passengers. One was even proudly carrying a pair of binoculars, complete with leather case, slung round his shoulder. During the journey I met one of the directors of the Iran match factory in Tabriz who is also interested in the electric light company in Rezaieh. He was going to Rezaieh to examine the company's position as they had apparently only sufficient gas-oil to continue running for one month more, despite the fact that there is no electricity during the day-time. It seems that, as usual, transport is the difficulty. 3. At Sharif Khaneh I spent the day with Mr. Sattarzadeh the port director, and visited the workshops which this time were working (on my last trip I went and returned on a Friday). I also visited the newly-reconditioned barge in 'dry-dock 1 i.e. lying on the dried mud shore. It is expected that it will be afloat within a few weeks. It has been almost entirely re-rivetted with rivets forged on the spot. I saw both the making of the rivets and the rivetting in progress. The next job which Mr. Sattarzadeh is undertaking is an old boat which has been lying on the mud for the past 15 years. It will require many new plates and will have to be completely re-rivetted; then, if a new engine is available, the Navigation Department will have another usable tug. I told Mr. Sattarzadeh that the supply of a marine engine would present grave difficulties but that if the Iranian Government could put up really cogent reasons to justify it no doubt the application would be seriously considered, subject to the limitations imposed by war requirements elsewhere. The best reason is that the Russians are using the lake more and more for the transport of troops and supplies, and that the greater the use made of this means the greater the saving of valuable rubber tyres. 4. At Sharif Khaneh I was introduced to one of the two local government doctors. He has a tiny hospital attached to the port. The mosquito season had already started but Mr. Sattarzadeh complained that he was not receiving supplies of Flit in the necessary quantities. Unless this could be remedied he foresaw a great loss of working hours in the port this summer through sickness. 5. At Gulma Khaneh, where we arrived at 3 a.m. I was met by the car of the Rezaieh Chief of Police, and so arrived in Rezaieh before 4 o'clock. 6. On May 20th I called on the Farmandar and spent an hour with him discussing various questions, after which I called on the Soviet Consul, who was however away in the mountains, so left a /card0* /10. card and said I would call the following day. I then called on the new Turkish Consul, Mr. Orhan Gunden, on Colonel Beylari Bey, the O.C. Persian troops, and on the Chief of Police. HARVSSTS . Everywhere throughout the district the crops are excellent and, encouraged by high prices end the better prospect*** of a raid-free year, the cultivators have been planting more land than usual. The fruit crops promise to be better than for many years, and the seed rice brought from Hianeh to Tabriz by British army convoys has arrived in time for sowing. 8. FOOD SITUATION . There has been an improvement generally, due, in the main, to the harvest prospects. A number of merchants who had been hoarding raisins throughout the winter look like getting their fingers badly burnt. There are said to be some l^Ju tons of raisins in Rezaieh from last year’s crop and, whilst there has been a huge fall in price, the Russians still refuse to let the raisins be sent out of Azerbaijan. The merchants have now together and have approached the Russian Consul with a request tha either the Russians buy the stocks themselves or else permit the export to other parts of Persia. With the prospect in front of them of a huge new crop coming on to the market in a few months time and a probable further drop in prices the merchants are beginning to squirm. It is doubtful if they will find the Russians sympathetic. The 5^&gt;- of this season’s wheat harvest which it was reported the Rezaieh landlords had offered to the Russians (Mr. Urquhart s letter of April 21st to Sir Reader Bullard) has, in fact, been oftered as a ct if't to the Soviet Red Cross. This was confirmed to me by the Farmandar who also said that he had reported the facts to the Governor- General. The offer, he added, had been accepted. 9. PRICES. In the middle of May there was a sharp fall in the prices of all local produce, followed after a few days by a recovery which was still continuing when I left on May 27th. The following table shows the prices of one or two main products in March last, on May 20th (the lowest level reached) and on May 25th:- March 20 th Mav 25th May Wheat 1250 tomans a ton Barley 90J »♦ h ii Raisins 1800 u h H Peas 1080 w »♦ 11 Wool 2440 rt « 11 Butter 67.10 Rials a Kilo 540 tomans 780 tomans 480 H 570 n 400 H 730 w 480 H 480 « 1220 »♦ 39.6 5 Rials The price of butter is going up again because, according to the manager of the Bank Melli, the Russians are making large purchases. The price of wheat he thinks v/ill fall again as the new harvest approaches. The price of breed is:- Lawash, Rials 7.50 a kilo; Sanirak. Rials 7; coarse bread Rials 6. ^ ^ ^ Wages have gone up and labourers who formerly got Rials &lt;_ per dav now get from 25 to 30, and in some oases as much as 40. There is therefore comparatively little real distress except perhaps amongst black-coated workers, although here too the majority are small la owners and have thus been able to eke out their inadequate salaries by th^ profits from their small-holdings. There is a deep and widespread distrust of paper money and I was told that the re-introduction of a gold and silver coinage - whatever its intrinsic metallic content would bring prices down more effectively than any other measure.ID. KURDS . There is little to add to the remarks I made on this subject in my last report. The Kurds appear to have taken the Russian warnings to heart and to be behaving. At the beginning of May the Parmandar summoned Kurdish leaders or their representatives to a meeting in Rezaieh. About twenty turned up but none from the Baradost area. The Soviet Consul and Colonel Beylari Bey were also present. The Kurds promised that there would be no breach of the peace this year and the Soviet Consul re-iterated hin warning as to the consequences if they forgot their promise. The Chief of Poiice is sceptical and says the Kurds are all liars and not to be trusted a yard. He himself is not an Azerbaijani (he scarcely speaks any Turki) so he probably reflects the attitude of the central government towards the Kurds. The Soviet Consul does not think the Kurds will give any trouble provided the Persian authorities act reasonably. The Nazlu ircident, reported in my last memorandum, has been ’settled’ by being more or less shelved. The Soviet Consul says he does not feel that any good will be achieved by pushing it further as a good deal of the responsibility for the incident rests, in his opinion, with the gendarmerie. He told me that when the Persians decided, with Russian consent, to establish the gendarmerie post at Nazlu a party of some twenty gendarmes was sent to the village. Instead of driving up in a lorry or marching openly up to the village, they deployed, encircled the village and crept towards it. The villagers, fearing they were about to be attacked, prepared to defend themselves. Both sides, of course, claim that the other fired the first shot. The Consul takes the view that this is immaterial and he is not prepared to punish the villagers for what he considers to have been stupid provocation on the part of the gendarmerie. Just before I left Rezaieh a small clash was reported in the north between two factions of the Shikak, the one led by Sartip and Hassan Hinari and the other by Jmar Khan and Kutai Mohammed. The incident is, I believe, just one of the usual family squabbles and has no significance. 11. RUSSO-TURKISH RSLATIQNS . These appear to be good and the new Turkish Consul, Mr. Orhan Cunden, will, I think, be a good antidote to the Vice-Consul. Mr. Q-unden told me that he thought that Nashaat Bey, the Vice-Consul, who had been in charge of the Consulate for the past year, had ’gone off the deep end r on the subject of Kurdish sheep-ste ling excursions into Turkish territory. He himself did not intend to take them too seriously. There always had been raids of this nature and as long as there were any Kurds they might be expected to continue. He did not believe for one moment, as did Nashaat Bey, that the Soviet authorities countenanced, much less encouraged, these raids. A few irresponsible Russian soldiers in the frontier areas might, he said, turn a blind eye, especially if they got a little fresh mutton out of it, and who could blame them in these hard times? One problem which seemed to be uppermost in Mr. Gunden’s mind was the post-war future of Azerbaijan. He tried very hard to get me to say that the Russians had no intention of leaving after the war. I only replied that I could see no reason for doubting the promises given by the Soviet Government and embodied in the Tripartite Treaty.. In view of his insistence, and also because he has come so recently from Ankara, I concluded that the Turkish Government are considerably exercised over this question. Mr. Gunden told me that there had recently been quite important Soviet troop movements in the Salmas area and asked me what I thought about it. I replied that.I could claim no /insideinside information but that now was obviously the time for the army to practise manoeuvres, which they could hardly do during the win er and that Salmas, which has always been, since the occupation, a big Soviet military centre, seemed to me to be as good a place as a n y• He appeared to be satisfied with this answer, which was probably in line with his own personal opinion. X2. RUSSO-PiiiKSIAN RELATIONS . It seemed to me that there had been a slight deterioration since my last visit. rhis may perhaps be due to Persian pinue that the Russians have managed to keep he Kurds in some sort of order without any very obvious effort and with no more than the threat of force. This attitude would explain why, in February, the Farmandar tried to minimise the Kurdish raids into Turkey, and now in May tries to exaggerate them. The Persian authorities were unable to put a stop to them, though it mus ® , admitted that this was not their fault since their hands were tied, and now they are anxious to- discredit the Russians by showing uhn they have been no more successful on this count than the Persians. Another pointer in the same direction was the Farmandar s constant harping on the desirability of having a British Consular Officer permanently stationed in Rezaieh, and his statement that he had heard 'from a most reliable source’ - they always are, oi course, - that a British military officer was shortly to be posted there. The Persians are most anxious to 6 °^ eon ® f »i n n v frq iLt Azerbaijan whom they think they will be able to play off against the Russians, and they would like the role to xall to us * . t The Persian attitude towards the Russians is perhaps b s illustrated by the recent recall to Tehran, wi ^ hou ^ ^Jj &gt;over 5?Q*' General in Tabriz teing informed, of the r armandar of Khoi. ih reason, acceding to the Governor of Rezaieh, was that the Governor of Xhoi, wto has the reputation of being a bit of a wag, was very friendly with the local Russian authorities and one day jokingly said that in future he would be known as 'Tovaritoh Parmandar . Thia an 'arently got to the ears of Tehran and the Parmandar foLd himself hurriedly summoned to meet the higher authorities, who, so it would seen, failed to see anything funny in it. this i= really the cause of the Prrmandor s recall (I had only She Governor of Rezaieh*a word for it) it might explain why Tehran failed to inform the Governor-Oeneral if the idea that th latTS is hand-in-glove with the Russians has taken root in Government circles. ■,* inatn-soVIST RELATIONS. There continue to be good. 1 Everywhere r^ith-thi-^^ti^t courtesy at the hands of the Russfans. The Soviet Consul in Rezaieh offered me his car to bring me to Gulma Khaneh on my return journey, whilst on .y arrival there Soviet soldiers carried my luggage to the boat. It wasTpiS! therefore, that one of the first things I learnt °n mv arrival in Rezaieh was that the previous week, on May Uth, totsul Vl hL m givSf thtn^ia^' m ^ 0 stly two nights in Rezaieh. s n sh i„.» He raised no objection and went out ot hi a way primarily, ^hSTtirmS^o^trettSflny'lt^id rumours to which RezaiehSECRET is extremely partial. He was not very successful as the interpreter, who was believed to be an Assyrian, was reported as having said in the town that the British officers had come to look for accommodation in Hyderabad for British troops who were shortly to replace the Russians there. I think it is reasonable to suppose that the welcome accorded to these ]intruders was due in part to the changed Russian attitude towards us since the successful conclusion of the Tunisian campaign, on which, however, we should be unwise to jpresume too much. In part also it was no doubt due to the fact that Mr. Maximoff, who seems to be a very level-headed man, was able to act on his own initiative. had the military commander been present the story might have been very different. I apologised to Mr. Maximoff for this incident and assured him that we would do our best to prevent a repetition and I also thanked him for the courtesy which he had shown to the officers. As regards the surveying of the. port at Hyderabad I said that I supposed that the British authorities had never lost sight of the possibility of using the Rowanduz route for supplies to Russia and that we were keenly interested in seeing that nothing was left undone which would help us in fulfilling our obligations in this .direction. Mr. Maximoff agreed and there, I hope, the matter on, the Russian side is closed, although I cannot feel sanguine that the Soviet military authorities will adopt an equally complacent attitude. 14. MOSl£M-ChRlSTIAH RELATIONS . On the whole there seems to be little religious ill-feeling due in part no doubt to the moderating influence of the old Mujtahid. There are, however, a few bad elements still active in creating trouble. The most unpleasant manifestation of Moslem fanaticism came at the end of March when Father Franssen, the head of the French Catholic Mission.received a parcel which when opened was found to contain the dead body of a child. An anonymous letter accompanying the package implied that someone in the Mission was the father of the child. Father Franssen at once went to the police but so far they have made little progress. It is suspected that since it was most likely a Moslem attempt to throw discredit on the Mission, the Persian authorities, who are all Moslems, are not anxious to uncover the plot which might involve their co-religionists in unsavoury proceedings. Father Franss.en is, however, determined to pursue the matter, if necessary through the Apostolic Delegate in Tehran. He also asked me to try to urge the local police to take up the affair more vigorously and I accordingly spoke to the Chief of Police and said that, as a French institution was involved, we could not. remain disinterested. He replied, to my astonishment, that he did not consider the matter very serious and thought it was only a schoolboy prankl I said that I viook a very different view and that I was surprised that he regarded it so lightly in view of the fact that a dead body was involved which the police had not yet succeeded in identifying. He then assured me that the secret police were continuing their investigations and that they thought they were on the track of the perpetrators of the outrage. I doubt whether anything will come of it unless the Apostolic Delegate can urge action in Tehran. I 5 * PROPAGANDA . The Russians still seem to be doing very little in this direction and I could discover no trace of their having sold or distributed pamphlets in Persian, Turki, Armenian, Kurdjs'h or Russian. This does not mean to say that such pamphlets do not exist os my enquiries had to be made very discreetly and must only be considered as very superficial. The Turkish Consul /toldSECRET never hidden her pro-lierman sympathies* She has been heard to ooast that they have means of communication whenever they want with the Germans, and it is also said that a German is actually living in the woman 1 s house and that .there is a secret radio transmitter there. It is difficult to imagine this being the case and the Russians knowing nothing about it. It is even possible that the woman is a Russian agent, especially as her boasts have been made to the French Sisters from whom she is now taking French lessons I Father Franssen has, however, passed the information on to the Soviet Consul. 18* PKRSlAn FORCRS . At present the Persian forces in Rezaieh consist of three regiments of infantry and four 75-pounder guns. Only one third of the infantry are equipped with rifles but it is expected that soon the proportion will be raised to one half. This is to be achieved by sending one regiment to Tehran. They will leave their rifles behind and these will be divided between the remaining two regiments. I cannot say whether this is Russian or Persian arithmetic. (Sgd.) F.C. Ogden. British Consulate-General, Tabriz. 5th June, 1943.i* Diary No.10 for 1943. bay 16th to Juno 7th. Weathor. In May we expect those tearing, duet-laden winds to set In here In Azerbaijan, but, the season being a late one, it was near the end of the month before the fjbrjrt-gwets came from the west to whip away from the Karadagh **** last tattered remnants of their white winter garb. And new even the lordly ! abends are out at the shoulders. Despite the wind we had good thunderstorms, with timely rain. A story that there had not been enough rain in the „ Maughan steppe and that flocks were being set to eet the orops where they stood was corrected by the Director of Agriculture who went there himself, in a oar borrowed from tbe Husslana, and reported that the rains had been aufftftj t eml &gt; and that the crops, as elsewhere, would beat Jill reeArda. A departmental oar exists in Tabriz, but it has no tyres, lor a ion- time the Director pinned his hopes on me to get him tyres through the influence of tbe Legation; but I expect hie priority is low, because he is still without his tyres, and now knocks on Russian doors when he wants transport, tit Locusts have been reported from the Maughan ateppe hut the Director of Agriculture eaya they will do no damage to this year*e crop at this stage. He says precautions ought to be taken to prevent breeding and possible damage next year. He is hopeful that the Russians will provide the necessary vehicles to enable him undertake this work. It will be in any case a small operation compared with what our people are doing in the south. 112. Agriculture . .bout ten tons of sorghum have been sown in Azerbaijan. It Is a new crop here and peasants were reluctant to handle it, but they were persuaded when assured that it would fetch the same price as barley and could be sold free of control I still have no figures of suger-beet sowings but I am assured they will not be lees than last year. Local officials have done nothing to Implement the government’s policy for collecting the harvest. None of the commissions has been appointed. Everything is being gladly left in suspense pending the arrival of Jawad Ahmlrl, who has been nominated to come from Tehran to take over the upply Dept, and collect the harvest. The Director of finance told me that of course Ahrairi is a distinguished official, but Implied that his experience wasn’t such as would qualify him for wheat collection. The government’s scheme provides for commissions to go around before the harvest estimating the yield and thui another aet of commlssiona to go out and lay hands on the grain at threshing time. It seems very doubtful to me whether Azerbaijan will attempt to do both rounds. The Director of Finance dwelt on the enormous distances, the bad roads, the lack of transport end the paucity of competent civil servants. 113. Coxamunica11 oas . The Persian post has speeded up with better weather and we have actually had mall in three days instead Thi V r ?iif3alns very isolated. Theme is no courier service ami the various staffs in lehran are clearly too occupied to be able to snatch all ch&amp;nce opportunities. Thus no communication other than telegrams was received from the Chancery between May 4th and Aky 28th, when an accumulation of undue weight fell on my reduced staff. Among much other belated material, a fine big map of Tunisia lay in Tehran from tie beginning of April, and reached Tabriz only on May IQth. This latter was particularly regrettable, because there were lorries leaving every few days by which non-oonfidential material could have been despatched, and because that map would have been most useful to me in my talks with the Russians about Tunisia. As it was, I had only a small map out from the 'New York Times’* of April 4th to show tne General. The service from America is sood.

Soviet Ambassador*s visit. §0 JUN Did it have any special significance? The Soviet Consul General here has been a sick man for months. He nearly died when his stomach ulcers perforated two or three months ago* and since then he has been continuously on the point of going to Baku for an operation. Meantime his children have been very ill. I Altogether they have had a bad time* and it is perfectly possible that j the Ambassador came up merely to took Kuznetzov and his family over. In favour of this theory is the fact that he was here for 36 hours only* and went off without seeing the Governor General* content apparently to accept the fact that Mogaddam was then still far from well. Mogaddam wanted to see him* according to what he told me two days after the Ambassador left* and he seemed slightly peeved that Smirnov had shot off without warning. No propaganda purpose was served by the visit. The Municipality gave him a meal* but there were no other functions and the public as a whole does not know he came. The Consul General got the news that he was on his way through the local authorities; before that he had only the vaguest warning that the Ambassador would come sometime. I had a long talk with the Governor General yesterday evening and it is clear that he had been all set to discuss with Smirnov the now urgent question of the ban on the export southwards of foodstuffs. (See paragraph 123 of my diary). I wonder if Smirnov’s sudden departure wasn’t perhaps evasive action. I have examined the possibility that the Governor General* being under suspicion from his own people* may be moved* apparently on the general accusation of being too friendly with the Russians; that therefore Smirnov came up to smell the local atmosphere and perhaps make plans for supporting a friendly Governor General. I don’t think this possibility should be ruled out altogether; I have felt quite {suspicious that Mogaddam should have* on May 31st and June 8th* made quite a point of not having seen the Ambassador. And it was quite uncalled for that Kuznetzov should have told me* a propos of almost nothing* that Smirnov was displeased with Mogaddam over the food situation. But if that was planned to forestall any impression that Mogaddam and Smirnov could possibly be concerting some plans* then Mogaddam wasn’t coached properly. Last night I threw a fly over him about the food situation and he quite frankly said he was dissatisfied* that the town hadn’t yet a proper reserve because the Russians had been using his lorries* but in a day or two he would get them back and then the situation would improve. On the whole I submit that the simple explanation meets the case* but I leave it to H.M. Minister with his wider range of information to decide definitely. 3« H.M. Minister’s proposed visit. I do not know whether Sir Reader Bullard will now consider it politic to come to Tabriz hard on the heels of the Soviet Ambassador. I have done what I could to forestall possible suspicions should he decide to come. I told Kuznetzov that the Minister had just gone to have a look at Isfahan and Shiraz and had intended to come and see Tabriz* but that I supposed a visit now would be open to all sorts of weird interpretations. This got a laugh out of Kuznetzov. I told the Governor General much the same thing. U • A. . d |k* The Governor General is of course, a rogue and the truth is not in him. On grounds of general dishonesty he no doubt merits Instant dismissal, but then they all do, these Persian officials. What Tehran objects to, I gather, is that he has cooperated too far with the Russians; but then again, Tehran habitually snipes at the men snet out to do a job, and would no doubt complain if he did hot manage to cooperate with the Russians. Personally I deprecate the suggestion that he has, so to speak, ^ sold Azerbaijan to the Russians. No doubt he has cultivated good relations with them, but unlessr I have been hoodwinked, he is not ^ pleased with the Russians for preventing the re-establish lent oi the Azerbaijan division (he is a military man primarily) nor does he like the fact that the Russians have kept the Kurds Quiet without his help. He is also necessarily in conflict with them over the export of almonds, raisins, etc, and he seemed a bit sour that they should have had the use of his lorries (was this his doing or was it ordered from Tehran?) to bring in their grain when he was hard pressed to feed Tabriz. He told me last night that they will soon have had 11,000 of- their 20,000 tons, but that they are not yet apparently satisfied, for all that at one stage they seemed prepared to close the account at about 9000 tons. Much therefore as I distrust him, I do not think the wild suggestions made in Tehran should be accepted as anything like true, and I think it important to judge him purely by his effectiveness in the allied interest at this juncture, and not to get bogged in the insinuations of his political enemies that he is pro—Russian, think that, considering generally, the situation in Azerbaijan is now more favourable for the allied war effort 1 than it has been since the occupation, and indeed than it is in some other parts of the country. Military . Before I knew that the American Military Attache weis on his way I suggested to General Fraser that I might throw a party to celebrate the then imminent capture of Tunis and that he might like to come up and fraternise with General Gaidoukov. I have had no reply and perhaps he would.not care to follow immediately in the steps of the U.S. Attache. I have done what I could to take advantage of General Gaidoukov’s cordiality. I took Major Granger (O.C. 203 GPT Coy, who happened to be staying v/ith me) and a convoy commander to a Russian concert on May 23rd and presented them to the General. On the 2ij.th I took Major Granger to the Russian military display, using the tickets issued for my wife in each case. I would not have risked t is a few months ago, but the Russians•were quite cordial. Major Granger bore bravely I. the fact that in the General’s box he was offered cigarettes of the j brand issued as rations to his Indian troops. I have reported that British military convoys began running here last December without any preparation worth mentioning. For some time they camped in great discomfort until I found them a house and a camping ground near this Consulate General. They are not entirely satisfactory and I have been at some considerable effort to make other arrangements. Unfortunately they involve outlay of capital, but about a month ago Lt.Colonel Edgell, of 16th L of C, came and approved them. Then hard on his heels came an Indian Major from Kermanshah Sub-Area, and he disapproved everything, preferring my original layout. He alleged that Kermanshah Sub—Area is in control, whereas Colonel Edgell says Sub-Area is just trying to find themselves a job, an&lt;d that they count for nothing. I have of course kept clear of this struggle for power, but it is tiresome to have landlords interviewed, to bespeak the help of the Governor General and the Chief of Police to overcome obstruction, and then to find an apparently firm project is the shuttlecock of rival groups. /Again,3 Again, Major Usman has asked us to entertain Indian troops* ri He thought v/e might have them on the lawn of an afternoon, and let them drink tea, or chew raisins and nuts according to whether they are Moslem or Hindu, and listen to the wireless from Delhi.- ^e are ready to do anything to maintain morale,, hut some convdy cojaiigjiders scoff at the mere idea of such entertainment, saying that the men wouldn’t want it nor would it he effective. A German T knew here in the old days used to tell a story about a couple sitting sedatelyion a park seat when two dogs came along to scandalise the -lady*;.—., Pegged her husband to do something to stop them. He demanded to Know what he could possibly do to stop them. ”0h, throw them a sweet, 5 or somethingi' cried the lady, to which he retorted ’’Would you stop x'or a sweet?* 1 So I think that, on the whole,, the sceptics win, and that a handful of nuts on the Consular lawn would not keep the troops away from these naughty Tabriz ladies. There is, among the GPT companies coming here, one, the 51st, which has made a great reputation as the model company. ’ Its road manners are perfect, its discipline was considered exemplary, and the fact which is stressed is that all its officers except the O.C. are Indians. Unhappily if has also begun to yield to the temptations of Tabriz, to tarnish its record. The fact is that for a few trips all goes well with these companies, but presently the men begin to know that they can get high prices for their rations, in cash or in favours. I have been able, by getting police posted around the camping ground, to abate the nuisance, but the real cure is a parking ground completely enclosed and at some distance from the town. Captain Shneerson, in charge of the 16th L of C group here, was evidently chosen for his knowledge of spoken Russian. He is not outstandingly tactful with the Russians, nor does he have any serious grasp on affairs which would make him as helpful generally as I hoped a Russian speaking officer might be. I regret more than ever that my request, made last January, for the loan of Sergeant Sanders was turned down. This man was born in Leningrad, and speaks and writes Russian very well. Moreover he is mature, sensible, studious and qiziet, Just, the typ^e settle down to a. steady Job in dull Tabriz. Officers whom;I have consulted think highly of him and I was most disappointed to learn recently that he has been all these months marking time with the 10th Motorised Brigade in Kum. My last information is that he has been sent to an OCTU at last, but I venture the suggestion that an effort might still, be mnde through the War Office to get him posted hre$ say as an additional Vice Consul. The military are continually asking for information which I find it difficult to supply and which they wpuld get more quickly if they would help by posting a man here. He could also read the*Caucasus press for me, and make contact with minor Russian officials,whom I have little opportunity of meeting. His particulars are:- 7687745 Sgt. E. Sanders, Int. Corps (P.S.W.) H.Q. Paiforce. United Kingdom Coyercial Corporation . ’’The name of the UKCC stinks in this country'. That was said to me by one of the company’s ’! officers. Another officer was at pains to make the distinction between the UKCC proper and the transport section which, in this country operates the lorries carrying supplies to Russia; it was that section, he alleged, which had earned disrepute for the name, iCertainly it is that section which we know best in Azerbaijan. Much of the obldquy was occasioned, no doubt, by teething troubles, by the inexperience of staffs working in Persia for the first time, by shortage of competent staff and the necessity to rely on Persians who proved dishonest, but some blame must be attributed to i the rigid refusal to backload. The military authorities are blamed for that decision and for the apparent refusal to consider how jharmful it is in practice. Theoretically it quickens the turnround of vehicles, but all the corporation’s agents whom I have met contest that theory. I recently appealed to the Chancery to tackle this problem, and a conscientious effort was made, but it came up against the brick wall of fixed orders which Chancery’s guns can’t breach. I am delighted that the matter has been taken up in London. /TheG .4 O The new Director of the Persian Transport Office in Tabriz was £? until recently UKCC representative in Shiraz. He relates that about last December in Shiraz he had an order to intercept all empty southbound trucks» as no steamer had arrived at Bushire from which they could be loaded. He did so* for thirty days or more* and then was told to send them all* about 300 by this time* back to Tehran. With the encouragement of his area superintendent* he loaded about half the lorries for Tehran* netting roughly about one million rials for the corporation. When presently he reported^ in person in the Tehran head office he expected a pat on the back for having loaded vehicles which would otherv/ise have rattled empty to Tehran* and for earning so much money* but he was S reprimanded instead. He went on to say that the Consul* Mr.Brenan* had tried to get goods backloaded on empty vehicles* but that the corporation’s policy was firmly against that. 'It is just a lack 'of proper organisation'* he concluded. That hurt* coming from a Persian. I wish to make it clear that I am as hostile as I could be to any fairy godmother policy towards Persians. They should be made to pay for everythin., they get. They won’t mind that. Good business men* these Tabriz merchants are as quick to appreciate logical* economical* and business-like arrangements as they are to despise illogical rigidity. When one considers the abuses which have flourished under this policy of refusing backloads* how it has led to delay to trucks* then the case against it is surely over whelming. r In an effort to stop the illegal traffic fostered so largely by its own policy* the corporation have sent two ex-warrant officers from the 8th Army to patrol the roads. They get £700 a year* plus important allowances* and minus only some £4 a month for Persian income-tax* much more* that is* than H.M. Vice Consul here draws now. One of them has been a thorn in the flesh to the local jnn^r-er. Tr e is the old soldier par excellence W'ith pretensions to gentility thrown in* But the very old Adam came out ^hen he was told to set up, quarters in Mianeh. _.He took a house and was _ found buying, a double Ded in Tabriz. His, disgusted mate then told the story* He had found a woman to keep house with a daughter of 17 to warm the double bed* at a joint salary of Rls.lQOO a month. The arrangement' broke down because he could not satisfactorily indicate to the mother what provision there would be for possible children. 'You see* sur* she wur a virgin* she wur. That made 'all the difference' explained the other ex-sergeant* a huge man who finds it difficult to express his ideas. I did not pursue why it made all the difference. Presumably this is a bit of the 8th Army’s lore* acquired in the desert. Anyhow* the story of the Rls.1000 has got round* an! now the home is nicely fixed with a Russian woman to do the unromantic chores* her Turkish husband* and a daughter of under 20 to take the risks which the virgin could not face. • * • An inspector has arrived to look into this matter* and even if he does not feel he can afford to throw the fellow out* personnel being so short* he will put an end to this state of things* The incident might well be quoted to prove how the British army put prices up. The mujtahid from Mahabad has just brought his wife to Dr.Hargreaves for an eye operation. As she will be unfit for work for some weeks the old fellow is to take another forthwith to carry on the household work* and he told Dr.Hargreaves that as he would sign up the papers himself the total cost would be Rls.100. Once she has got that she works for her keep merely. But if the story of the Rls.1000 a month gets around up here there will be no more ten toman wives to be had.

Now is the time when, for example, exporters of apricots buy their requirements and make preparations for gathering and packing the fruit. But some of these men have had their fingers badly burned, speculating In commodities which have fallen sharply, and they lack capital for the time being; others fear to lay out their capital, seeing no sufficient outlet for the great quantities of fruit which will be grown. Similar reports are coming from Rezaieh. There are stocks of raisins held over from last year. Before they commit themselves to buying the new harvest merchants want to know that the Russians will p-rmit its movement to the south and they want a guaranteed price. So they are telegraphing to Millspaugh. Allah has done his share and sent a bumper harvest; now it is Millspaugh who, one hears on all sides, 'must'* do this and arrange that. To all appearance M&amp;M Millspaugh has the harder part* *»£*&lt;£* ; 97 . Communications . By astonishing good luck no heavy rain has fallen on th® Shibll pass although within a few miles of it there have been heavy downpours which, in the opinion of the Royal Engineers, would have caused the threatened landslide if they had fallen at the danger spot. It could happen yet, but work on the supporting wall is proceeding so that every day lessens the danger. On May 13th two convoys met right at the critical point. The Russians have been asked to post military police to control traffic, but have failed to do so, and the contractors do what they can by posting civilians. The signal was made to one convoy to halt while the other passed, but the leading chauffeur came on and when he did stop, assaulted the man on duty and tore up his flag; then he had to leap into his lorry to escape the anger of workmen coming to the rescue of their comrade, starting his engine he drove through the orkraen, mowing down five, of whom three are reported severely injured. Failing ussian military control I have asked the Governor-General to post gendarmes and he has agreed to do so, but he cannot produce sufficient gendarmes to control traffic at all difficult points on the road, and in any case Persian gendarmes cannot control Russian drivers, and won’t try. The offender in this instance was a Persian, however. Since British military convoys, as w*ll as UKCC lorries, are frequently concerned, I have in the past few months frequently reported the need for effective road control, lest some serious incident occur* The following is taken from the comments on my reports by UKCC headquarters in Tehran: ,'Experience has shown that the only effective method of road 'control involves supervision of the movement of vehicles by 'military personnel, and this method is adopted in both the 'British and Russian controlled zones when one-way working or 'other delays necessitate such a measure.' There is no road control at such points In the Russian zone, and it is by no means a matter of preventing 'petty contraventions of road rules' as the further comment seeks to suggest. There was no control at the many points where one-way working was necessary during the winter snows, nor is there now at the two supremely important points, viz. the Shlbli pass and the Kaflan Kuh /bridge,j 2. bridge, an anoient structure ehioh ie not standing up to the pounding of present day traffic, and which is causing theMoyal Engineers a good deal of concern* \ 98* rii mliea to Buasla * The supply of railway waggons has bosn rather better latsly, hut there la still congestion# . r Director of XransoTtrans has been particularly grumpy and diffioul s with our conYoy oonunandera because much of the meat arriving here seems to be near its expiry date - some of the tins have in fact blown already# He ia thraatening to reject whole loads in which he finds blown tins, and his predicament is understandable.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch from the consul-general at Tabriz, No. 17, enclosing a report on Consul Ogden’s recent visit to Rezaieh. Tehran, 30^ March, 1943. . . Enclosure. Consul-General Urquhart to Sir R. Bullard {Tehran). 17 Tabriz, 20th March, 1943. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith Mr. Vice-Consul Ogden’s report on his recent visit to Rezaieh. ... , 2. Mr. Ogden had to endure discomfort in making the journey by rail ana lake steamer, more particularly at this season, but in my opinion the visit was well worth while. I propose that it should be repeated towards the end at April so that we may this year have the benefit of reliable information about any Kurdish raids which may take place. . ^ 3. Mr. Ogden’s report reveals a picture only too tamiliar. Ine teitne garden which stretches along the western shore of Lake Urmia lies open and invitin^ to the hungry mountain Kurds. I he Persians want to re-establish their gendarme posts and to make them strong; but the Russians will neither agree to the numbers of posts which the Persians want, nor will they allow sufficient strength of men at the points of which they approve. So these weak groups are either chased away or wiped out by the Kurds who are clearly as determined this year as they were last that the gendarmes shall not again be re-established in their midst. . , n , 4. The Turkish Consul appointed to Rezaieh has not yet taken up his post, and the vice-consul remains in charge. That is a pity. He is dangerous lemg prone to exaggerate and embellish. That will have to be borne in mmd if he is still in charge when the raiding season begins. * 5 The Turkish Vice-Consul’s health propaganda may perhaps be^ as politically innocent as Miss Palmer-Smith’s recently-established infant welfare scheme in Rezaieh, or our own medical and other relief activities m the British zone of ( ^P^^ omment is that the Russians seem still to he marking time in Western Azerbaijan, working still to a formula of military precautions. I see no sign of evolution in their policy. There is no apparent attempt to modify its rigidity in face of local developments, and no sign of interest from Moscow. 6 J I have, &amp;c. R. W. URQUHART. Sub-Enclosure. Memorandum. I LEFT Tabriz on the 26th February by train for Rezaieh I he train left at 11 a m and arrived in Sherif Khaneh at 3 p.m. after stops of half an hour at [41 - 43] c/4^. a ) * B2 Sofian and twenty minutes at Ziba. At Sherif Khaneh I was invited by Mr. Sattarzadeh, the head of the Navigation Department, to spend the time until the departure of the boat at his house. Mr. Sattarzadeh, who studied engineering from 1924 to 1929 at the London Polytechnic, speaks good Lnglish and 1' i’ench and Russian. He gave me a considerable amount of information regarding the boat services on the lake and of the material under his supervision. The details are set out in an appendix to this memorandum. Sherif Khaneh, situated at the north-eastern end of Lake Urmia, is a small hamlet separated from the lake b&gt; w a wide stretch of grey slime, which makes the whole area smell like a sewage farm. It is also a notoriously bad area for malaria. It boasts two doctors, but during the summer months a very high proportion, sometimes more than 50 per cent., of the workmen employed in the repair shops are continuously laid up. I he boat left at 10 p.m. and, despite a strong north-westerly blizzard, made a rapid crossing, arriving at Gulma Khaneh, the port for Rezaieh, shortly after 2 a.m. From there the journey was completed in a droshke, arriving at Rezaieh at 5-30 a.m. 2. On Monday, the 1st March, I paid official calls on the Farmandar, the officer commanding the Persian troops, and the Soviet Consul and the furkish Vice-Consul. These visits were returned in the afternoon and the following day. I subsequently called on the commandant of gendarmerie, the chief of police, and, at his own invitation, on the Assvrian bishop. As a counter-balance to this last visit I also called on the Mujtahid, the head of the Moslem religious community. * ^ 3. Food Situation .—As everywhere else the situation leaves much to be desired. Wheat is short owing to the activities of the Kurds last year and to hoarding by land-owners and speculators. In the middle of February the position became so acute that there were fears of rioting. Colonel Mahin, then the Officer Commanding Persian Troops, and the Soviet Consul, together visited the bazaars and promised an improvement in the bread situation. The following day wheat a was produced and the immediate danger averted, but the Government stocks in the town remain very low. According to the Farmandar the price of wheat has risen in the market^ during the past twelve months from 200 tomans a ton to over 1.000 tomans. During the first two weeks of March there was a tendency for the price to fall, and the current price is about 950 tomans a ton. The Farmandar still maintains that there are no considerable stocks hoarded in Rozaieh itself, but says that the Kurds undoubtedly have large stores remaining after their pillaging of last year, even taking into account the quantities they smuggled into Iraq. They are now sending occasional small quantities into Rezaieh to be sold at the present high market prices. The prices of other food stuffs are generally the same as in Tabriz, exceptions being eggs, which are 16 shahis each as against 20 in Tabriz, and chickens, which are 15 to 20 rials as against 30 to 40. . . . kW -i Q , The first attempts at rationing proved a lamentable failure, bugar was to be rationed from December and ration cards were issued. It was then discovered that the number of people to draw rations greatly exceeded the population of Rezaieh. Corrupt minor officials had, for a consideration, been adding imaginary names to family ration-cards. As a result the cards were withdrawn and up to the present no sugar has been issued. If and when a new scheme is evolved, it seems most unlikely that back rations for the past months will be issued. If not issued it would be interesting to know whether Government stocks of sugar have been sent to Rezaieh for this period and what has become of them. I have mentioned this point to Mr. Vivian since my return as possibly being worthy of investigation. As regards the cheap Government bread, there were complaints from the Assyrian community that the Moslem community were receiving preferential treatment. There is nothing new in this and it is not serious, although it is certainly true. The Farmandar has promised Father Franssen, of the Catholic Mission, that he will supply cheap bread to all necessitous Christian families of all denominations according to a list to be drawn up by Father Franssen and vouched for b\ him. . , , . . 4 Hoarding .—The anti-hoarding laws, and particularly the clause by which those who denounce hoarders are entitled to a reward equal to 20 per cent, of the hoarded grain, have not been publicised in Rezaieh. The Assyrian bishop thinks that if the law were known many would come forward with information and large stocks, hidden in the countryside, would be revealed. He thinks, however? that it would be useless if the information had to be revealed to Persian Government officials.3 5. Spring Sowings .—These are everywhere in the Rezaieh area above the average and, with the heavy snowfall this winter, should produce bumper harvests. Forty tons of rice seedlings promised by the Persian (lovernment aie anxious awaited. This rice, at present at Mianeh, should, with the help being gi\en b\ British military convoys to transport it to labriz, get to Rezaieh in time foi sowing. Harvest prospects will, however, depend to a very great extent on the Kurdish situation. . , ^ 6 Kurds and Security .—There is every reason to believe that the Kurds are arming as hard as they can. They are purchasing rifles at exorbitant prices, frequently paying with the grain that they pillaged last vear. throughout Western Azerbaijan there seems to be a great fear amongst the cultivators that the events of last year will be repeated. Nothing has yet been done or said to alleviate this fear, and recent incidents (detailed later) have not helped to improve the situation. The answer lies with the Russians. ‘The Persians sit bacK and, when things go wrong, just say “ Non mea culpa.” The Russians retaliate with the fiction that it is not their affair. But this mutual “ washing of hands will not solve the problem. I feel, after mv contacts with Doth Russian and Persian officials in Rezaieh, that the Russians came into this country without any policy whatsover, and that they have got themselves into a pretty sorry mess. I heir first idea was that the Persians would be of no help to them and that the Kurds, being violently anti-Persian, might; so they tried to make friends with the Kurds, even going to the length of rearming them. Because things went well m the Caucasus for the Russians, the Kurds have been naturally strongly pro-Russian. But if the Germans had succeeded in breaking through the Caucasus to 1 ersia. i am sure the Russians would have found their own arms turned against them by the same Kurds* who would have seen vistas of great plunder opened to t em. However having made these overtures to the Kurds the Russians now find themselves saddled with a rather tiresome and embarrassing friend. M Maximoff, the Soviet Consul in Rezaieh, seems to appreciate the necessity for settled conditions in Western Azerbaijan and the production this year of the highest possible quantity of food-stuffs. He has on several occasions helped the Persian authorities to keep the Kurds in order and there is little doubt the moral effect on the Kurds of M. Maximoff s associating himself with the Persians is very great. Though the Russians have obviously no intention of i ivin ; the Persians a free hand (which may be the reason why they have acquired the reputation of being the “ protectors ” of the Kurds), I do are doing other than discourage the Kurds from causing trouble he rurkish Vice-Consul in Rezaieh thinks otherwise, and spoke darkly of the activities of two Kurdish-speaking Russians, whose names, he said were Vusofov and Tafarov and who are, according to him, constantly out amongst the Km ds. added° that he doubted whether the Soviet Consul himself was kept .properly fi fonned of their doings. Whilst the possibility of the Russians having some dark plot up their sleeves cannot be completely disregarded, it seems at least eouallv probable that these agents are no more sinister than our own political officers in Iraqi Kurdistan, and that their task is to keep the Russian authorities informed as to what the Kurds are up to. However, the Russians also have their fair share of suspicions against us as is shown by their action m arresting a peaceful Kurdish inhabitant of Rezaieh, one Mehmet Nndiq by name, and expeUin.-' him from the Russian-occupied zone The suspicion that he was a ^British a-ent ” seems to have derived from the facts that he is the son of an Iraqi Kurd, is well-educated and, amongst his accomplishments, counts a good knowledge of Enghsh. - n^ ig stm exercised over the continued raids by armed Kurds across the Turkish frontier. He says that one of the Turkish Governors in the frontier zone has written to him to say that the people aie raoTdlv losino- patience and that, unless the raids stop, there is danger that they wm &lt; et out If hand and start retaliatory raids into Persian territory He (the vice-consul) is not concerned with the fate of the Kurds, nor particularly with the effect of such raids on the relations between Turkey and leisia. but he is afraid that if armed bands of Turks do cross the frontier, they may quite easily come into conflict with Soviet troops, a happening to be avoided at all costs. He told me finally that the Turkish forces on the frontier are to be conside ab &gt; strengthened in the spring. It is to be hoped that the Russians are told of any ^uchdndthe reasons which have made it X^lSt'a d^n7o TurS certainlv suspect some ulterior motive. During the latest J have territory the Kurds got away with more than 1.000 sheep, me Kiusiam nave4 recovered some 200 of them and handed them over to the Turkish V ice-Consul, but, although they have been supplied with the names oi the raiders, they say icy cannot arrest them. The Turk takes the view that it is a case o rather than “ can not.' . . , The Turkish Vice-Consul is busy also arranging for the repatriation, when weather conditions permit, of some fifteen Turkish families, comprising a )ou L eighty persons in all, who have been in Azerbaijan for many years but who now are reluctant to return to their villages for fear of the Kurds. I feel that the Turkish Vice-Consul is inclined to over-emphasise the gravity of the local situation, but I think, in fairness to him, that it must be admitted that anyone living in Rezaieh for any length of time will inevitably tend to view anairs o parochial interest as of international importance. Nashaat Bey is certainly an energetic person, and I wa^ told by an outside observer that when the tormei Turkish Consul was in Rezaieh he was the “wagon” and Nashaat Bey the “ locomotive.” He certainly bullies the Farmandar, as I myself witnessed, but gets nowhere by such tactics. He despises the Persians for their corruptness and dilatoriness, and told me that after the war there will have to be a return to capitulations. I imagine that this is only his personal opinion, and 1 hope he has not expressed himself so freely to his Soviet colleague. It was Nashaat Bey who told me the story, which he said he had had at first hand, of a Persian officer who was in command of a defence line during the Russian adv ance into \\ estern Azerbaijan The line consisted of two parallel trenches, the second some considerable distance behind the first. The officer charges his men 10 rials tor places in the second trench. When the Russians arrived the officer was, of course, well on the way to Tehran. He obviously has all the makings of a geneial. Apart from the problem of Kurdish incursions into Turkey, there were two incidents of importance which occurred during my stay in Rezaieh. On the 21st February a clash occurred between gendarmes and Ibrahim Bek Shikak s Kurds, when the gendarmes were ambushed on the main Shahpur-Rezaieh road at a point where the mountains come down almost to Lake Urmia. Three o’endarmes and three Kurds were killed. Colonel Mahin, the Commanding Officer Persian Forces in Rezaieh, and the Soviet Consul went together to see Ibrahim * Beo- Shikak, who professed complete ignorance of the affair. Nothing further has been done, but the participation of the Russian Consul at the interview is generally regarded as having been sufficient to give Ibrahim Beg an unpleasant shock. The history of this incident goes back much further. Some time ago a certain Zero, an Iraqi Herki of no importance, came over to Persia and occupied the village of Kukiya, belonging to Colonel Afshar. a retired Persian officer, now believed to be in Tehran. Zero ingratiated himself with the Russians and was allowed to remain. He then brought over some of his tribe from Iraq and assumed the title of “ Beg.” No Persian gendarmerie post was established in his area, where he ruled like a little king. Ibrahim Beg Shikak had also been fiee of o-endarmes and there had been no banditry or robbery in his little domain. When, therefore, the Persians wished to establish a post in his area—inciden tally merely a sort of half-way house, as their two nearest posts were too far apart—Ibrahim Beg had a fit of jealousy and decided that he was not going to be treated less favourably than the upstart Zero. Immediately, minor robberies occurred on the road where, before the arrival of the gendarmes, perfect peace and security had existed. This culminated in the serious clash on the 21st February. The second incident occurred on Sunday, the bth March, when Kurds and \ssyrians of Nazlu village (the Assyrians of this area have a very bad name even amongst their co-religionists) together attacked a newly established gendamerie post held only by two gendarmes. The head of the village is a certain Hassan Hinari, a notorious bad-hat. and the leader of the attacking gang was his nephew. Of the two gendarmes, one was wounded and the other surrendered. The Kurds were about to leave the wounded man in the snow when he protested and said that it was their duty to take care of their prisoners; whereupon they put him up against a wall and shot him in cold blood. A relief force of gendarmerie was driven back by the Kurds and lost two men. On the 7th March the officer commanding the Persian troops in Rezaieh, accompanied by the chief of the gendarmerie, the Soviet Consul and several Russian officers, went to Nazlu. Several Kurds were arrested but subsequently released. The Soviet Consul is said to have told them that they have got to have the gendarmerie post whether they like it or not and that any further disturbances will be severely dealt with. The situation is now said to be “ normal.”5 In the mountains to the south-west of ftezaieh Nuri Beg still rules the roost. Recently the Persians wished to establish a gendarmerie post in Ushnuabad, but Nuri Beg sent some of his armed Kurds down to prevent it and, without blood shed, was successful, and the project has been shelved. Nuri Beg is also saio to have three Armenians working for him at his headquarters in Anbi village, manufacturing cartridges and grenades. Another incident, without political importance, occurred a few weeks ago m ^^the village of Babarud, where a young Armenian of bad repute started a collection amongst Armenians for a tank for the Soviet army! At one house he refused 16 tomans and demanded 20 as a minimum. Whilst he was insulting the owner of the house the latter's son arrived and tried to drive the collector away with the help of a pitchfork; whereupon the Armenian pulled out a revolver and shot the son dead. He then made off into the mountains. The Russian Consul is reported to have given orders that the murderer is to be caught and brought to justice. . To resume, the general opinion is that the Kurds will not repeat then depredations of last year if the Russians show that they will not stand for it. As the Russians in the person of M. Maximoff, have recently been showing a firmer front towards the Kurds, there is less apprehension than might otherwise have been evoked by the clashes between the Kurds and the Persian gendarmerie. looking further ahead, the Christian community in Rezaieh fears that, if the Russians ever leave the area before the Persians are sufficiently strong to ensure public security, the Kurds, turning the tables on history, will “ come down like the wolf on the fold.’’ The only original suggestion which I heard as a way out of the present impasse came from Commandant Kemal, the Chief of the Persian gendarmerie. He said that the best solution would be for the present Anglo-Russo-Persian treaty to be scrapped and for Persia to declare war on the Axis, thus becoming an active instead of a passive ally. The Russians, he thought, could then have no objection to the Persian army in Western Azerbaijan being strengthened sufficiently to be able to deal with the Kurds. He added that many Persian army officers were of his opinion. This may be true, but if so I suspect that it is the success of the Russian offensive and a desire to be on the right side of the fence that has brought about this change of heart, i he Russians might be expected to receive such a suggestion a little coldly. 7. Propaganda .—Our propaganda is extremely popular. I took with me a large sack of material for our agent in Rezaieh. The whole consignment was sold out within twenty-four hours. Russian propaganda does not appear to exist. The Russians seem to approve of our objective propaganda, but to be a little bit jealous, perhaps because they have not themselves got an organisation equally efficient. We need to walk warily and, above all, to keep the Russians well informed of what we do and of what we intend to do in this sphere. I told the Soviet Consul about our cinema van, and said I hoped it would be coming to Western Azerbaijan in the spring. He professed it to lie a good idea, and said he had asked for the same thing, but that he had only been able to get the loan of a single military cinema van for one brief tour (this was presumably the van which borrowed several of our news-reels). Whilst the Russians seem to be doing nothing in the way of propaganda, I was rather surprised to find that the Turkish Vice-Consul is going in for it in quite a large way. Wh. are doing it as a war-time necessity, and the Russians would be equally entitled to put their point of view on the subject of the evils of the Nazi and Fascist regimes; but the Turks, as neutrals, have not the same legitimate excuse, and I fear that Nashaat Beg’s enthusiasm may get him into difficulties with both the Persians and the Russians. His latest idea is to send sets of coloured diagrams explaining how to combat malaria, tuberculosis, &amp;c., all in Turkish, to the local hospital and to local doctors. There is no doubt a very great need for such instruction, but, coming from the Turkish Consulate, it is fikely to be sadly misinterpreted by the Persians and, which is more important, by the Russians. 8. Local Politics .—The situation in Rezaieh appears to be neither better nor worse since the departure of the Ustandar. The bringing of Rezaieh under the control of the Ustandar in Tabriz has been met with complete indifference amongst the population. The only remark I heard on the subject was to the effect that there was now one less to dip into the till. Meanwhile, Dr. Marzeban, who returned to Tehran in December ill the official car, has not so far sent the car back to Rezaieh. with the result that the Farmandar has to do without.The Rezaieh Municipality is extremely slack. The roads are in an appalling state and there are no signs of any improvements anywhere, the taxes appear to go to keeping a few minor officials in idleness. The head of the municipality is a certain Hussein Mustashari, a rich landowner, who was formerly the head of the Public Instruction Department. He deserted his post during the Kussian occupation and now spends his time smoking opium. The present Director of Public Instruction, M. Muayzi, has caused a certain amount of resentipent amongst-the fathers of Rezaieh on account of his habit of running after the pupils of the girls’ schools. It is rumoured that he is shortly going to be replaced as director by the Farmandar s son. 9. Persian A rmy .—The commanding officer, Colonel Mahin. whose tact and savoir faire have enabled him to get on with everybody, not excluding the Kurds, has been transferred, and he left Rezaieh whilst I was there. His departure is regretted by all, and fears have been expressed that his successor, Colonel Beylari Beg, will not wield the same soothing influence. This remains to be seen, but the new commanding officer does not give the impression of being as energetic nor as diplomatic as Colonel Mahin. Colonel Beylari Beg has just been trans ferred from Khoi and is not pleased with the move. He speaks French and is personally agreeable. The junior Persian officers have not acquired much of a reputation. They are corrupt and insolent. According to Father Franssen, this is because they are recruited from the secondary schools and are nearly always the boys who have been too lazy or who are mentally incapable of passing their examinations. The officers and n.c.os. are responsible for the lack of any real esprit de corps in the local garrison. 10. Soviet Army .—I found everywhere the highest praise for Soviet discipline—frequently followed by comparisons extremely derogatory to the Persian army. There is, however, no sign of any attempt to fraternise with the local inhabitants, nor do the Soviet officers appear to have any contact with Persian or foreign officials. F. C. OGDEN.

The boat service on Lake Urmia is run with barges which are towed by tugs. The Navigation Department of the Persian railways has its offices and workshops at Sherif Khaneh and the present director has recently started a small brass foundry in the workshops which enables many jobs to be done on the spot which previously had to be sent in to Tabriz. The Lake service is run by six tugs, all pre-Great War. There are two large tugs (the Pahlevi and the Shahpur), each of 220 h.p., three medium tugs of 80 h.p., and one small tug of 35 h.p. There are eight large flat-bottomed barges each capable of carrying some 150 passengers. Accommodation on the barges is very dirly and primitive and is not suitable for Europeans, especially in winter, when it is not possible to remain on deck in the7 f N open. If either of the two large tugs is making the journey it is sometimes possible to arrange to have the use of a single small cabin behind the wheelhouse on the tug. Until the Russian occupation there was a weekly round-the-lake service connecting up with Maragheh and Mahabad. This service has been discontinued by the Russians and the only service now operating for civilian traffic is the bi-weekly service between Sherif Khaneh and Gulma Khaneh (for Rezaieh). The J-&lt; * Russians very frequently use the boats for military traffic between Sherif Khaneh and Shahpur. For a period of ten years the level of the lake fell regularly, probably as the result of earthquake action, with the result that the jetty at Sherif Khaneh had to be lengthened,. Its present length is 1,200 metres. The main jetty is of earth and will carry a train. The extension is of wood and is equipped with hand- trolleys on rails for the transport of heavy goods to the boats. There are no cranes.\ \ v X Decode of Telegram From - Reserve Bank of India, Calcutta. To - Secretary of State for In^i^.

Mr. Vivian agrees that it must be his constant aim to assure the Russians that they will get their 20,000 tons grain; otherwise we can only expect obstruction from them. Sugar and tea are now oeing issued to the public in Tabriz on ration. Bread rationing is still not in ooer- ation. The Governor-General promised me that he would punish hoarders in an exemplary manner, but I gather that he hopes Mr. Vivian will pull that chestnut out^of the lire for him. Mr. Vivian is in fact contemplating a drastic notice declaring all wheat to be the property of the Govern ment . 5 * T&amp;aGSrQRT . For two months or so Mr. Birkle has had a representative here charged with the task of putting as many lorries as possible into commission and of making the best use of them for urgent civil purposes, which in effect means transport oi foodstuffs. I recently Questioned this man as to his work and ne almost tearfully told me a long story of recommendations and appeals ignored by Tehran, of pressure irom private interests in Tehran to get lorries south from Azerbaijan. At the moment he has just over 50 lorries at his disposal, but Legation give me the good news that 50 more will be sent to Azerbaijan. This should, I have told both Mr. Vivian and the transport man, suffice for the est ablishment oi the feeder lines to bring wheat from Ardebil and hashtarud to the main road, and at the same time for the collection of grain for Tabriz and the Russians. Despite reports to Tehran from several quarters, the shortage of petrol at Mianeh persisted well into January, and one British convoy in the first week had 42 vehicles stranded along the roadway overnight. But the weather was xind; the only casualty was one man killed as another lorry overtook his stationary venicle. Eventually, sufficient vehicles were detailed to provide a sufficient supoly at Mianeh. 6* rUBLXG GAOURlTf . Nothing to report.

But we were made to stand, some seventy ^persons, throughout the meal, and there was no placing. My poor Soviet colleague made a rush when supper was announced and went along the corridor twenty yards ahead of the main body of male guests, when the national anthems were played the British preceded the 'InternationaDd'. After I had said ”a few words'* time. nuznetzov took her husband apart from the table ana spoke with him urgently, but he remained speech-bound and was an unhappy man for the rest of the evening. It is disappointing to iind realists like the Russians taking such trifles to heart, out I don*t think it will upset Mr. Kuznetzov for long. He is a good fellow and was quite restored to good spirits wnen I saw him a few days later. Tfce-Qoycn'iwp S&lt;inu-r»l~ hod a good deal- to say about-~a purge • -&amp;tee wteae At. When I made one of my periodic visits to enquire about progress with wheat collection, the Governor-General had much to say about the corruption and incompetence of officials in the Finance aid Wheat Monopoly Departments, and he said he was going to clear out a number of them. I wondered if we had a strong hand in Azerbaijan at last, but was disappointed when I found that he had merely passed the suggestion on to Mr. Vivian, leaving him to take action so unpopular. M r * Vivian, quite rightly I consider, decided to have a try at making the department work as it is. After all, there exists no reserve from which competent officials can oe recruited to replace the duds and the dis honest in this country and Mr. Vivian has enough to do for the moment without looking for trouble, lie may even, by his example, move these departments to some sort of effective action, but sooner of later he will have to gut rid of some whose best endeavours must necessarily be dev »ted to covering up their past sins. Six officials have been sent from Tehran to assist Mr. Vivian and he is sending them out to wheat-growing centres as his own. Some of them are known in Tabriz, and they were classified as ’*Kohna Gurdler'* - meaning '’old wolves'*, which is the generic term in Azerbaijan for Persian officials.0. x.ilLI'rARY : x- q rbian .

After the British enquiry was made he confessed his anxiety about renting the house to us, lest the Germans get here and knock the building to pieces* So at this moment, with the tide to all appearance setting in our favour, people of standing and education nere still think of a German victory as a business possibility.

The Governor-General» judging oy his own account, must nave appeared obstructive; he dwells gladly on the mistakes and difficulties, particularly the lack of tyres* 1 advised Mr. TanimX to maKe a start with any old lorries he could lay his hands on, but he was spared the need for drastic action because before to© end of tne month he told me that le hr an had at last sent tyres and lorries, and that with these and the lorries which ne would divert from sugar-bbet collection ne *ouid nave a goodly fleet.

The Governor-General, as X have reported by despatch, had planned to negotiate with the Kurds for their re-submission i to t ne central authority, out he bias not moved fast enough. In coiisequence of this latest disorder at Mahabad it was decided in principle to send Persian troops and gendarmes, one battalian of eacn, to take charge, and Ghazi iionaamed came to me to say he feared this would result in fighting. At the end of November, ; however, there was no sign of troops or gendarme® being available for this job. * COALlUh,A. cegg,jvu-du;.. . The Turkish Consul-General has taken his leave and departed by car via Krserum, accompanied by an omnibus specially hired for nis dogs, and by this time will have been reunited with his German mistress whom he had to send away from Tabriz. He was a very sick man when he left. In my reports in the early summer I tried to describe the atmosphere of Eezaieh where I found everyone trying to arm himself at all costs, convinced that his neighbour might fire on Aim at any moment. I recorded that the Turkish Vice-Consul kept in his bedroom a whole armoury, ranging from a Persian machine- gun to an automatic pistol. Towards tne end of the month he arrived in Tabriz travelling to Tehran as courier, and he brought a breath of tne itezaieh atmosphere with him. In his car he carried a rifle; a lovely piece which had been presented by the liauser people to Oliver fasha and sold from his estate. To demonstrate its lightness and beauty he produced two types of fersian army rifles kept by tue Turkish Consulate-General here.’ Then when he coxae to lunch it was observed that his coat caught in tne outt of a pistol in his hip pocket. If the Turks are^right with all their experience of these parts, in taking such precau tions to protect theaeelve® and tneir consular premises, then we are sadly neglectful in this Consulate-General. It is curious how unlike their reputation for sturdy imperturoability are the Turks one meets here. The outgoing Consul-General could talk of little but the missing half (latterly it became two-thirds) of nis intestines and his succession of maladies; 1 near with dismay that nis successor is a sick man too* The recently appointed Consul suffers from arterio-scleroais and has giddy fits if he eats anything more solid than yaghourt. The outgoing Consul from Hesaleh suffers from some incurable skin disease. The Vice-Consul is fit but he long® to get away and has been trying to persuade a colleague at Rhodes to swop with him; but trie Rhodes man says he prefers British bombs to the Russians* All are excitable and profoundly antl-Rueelan.

Most harmful publicity was given to the proposals to extend tne note issue and people were led to believe that the proposal was a new and disastrous one. Panic purchasing of foodstuffs and kerosene ]set in and presently there was a tendency to buy any com- laodity whatever and a reluctance to sell — in aaort, a &gt;flight from txie rial. The Governor-General told m towards the end of October Uxat he still aad no Instructions aojut the seilirig price of wheat to the oukers, out that he was centinning to issue two-thirds of the city's doily require ment a at the old price. Many bakers, he thought, were hoarding the wheat or selling it to friends lastaad of turning it into oread, iue net result was an acute shortage of oread and a steep lucre axe In price, ho doubt many more tnaxi the bakers were profiting by the panic.

There la no shortage ^ow. There is something like 1,000 ioniof whaat in the silo, collected fros? the imnediate neighbourhood of Tabriz. The Gpvernor-Creneral aseembled the master- bakers and triad to secure reductions in the price of bread, but he had little success, rud that was terpPfary. Prices ere irreeiatibly on the up-grade, said the sky** the li!?it. How could it be otherwise when Turkey is efferin# £la. 5,000 » ton against the His. 1,500 which officials liku to pretend in the open merket price, and a&amp;alnbt the official price for landlord*e rrain of His. 1,200 a ton l The Tehran Government ie fertile in schemes. Take two of the latest to to handed out: a) The peas^ntr grain will be paid for half in ctush, half in tea, . ugar or piece-gooda. Veir^ attractive indeed, but uo the atocka of these commodities exist 7 TTiey do not, apart from com© tea in Tabriz, neither in Eastern or 7'estern Azerbaijan, nor Us there,j^y plan fer controlling the issue of these commodities, or any indication to what limits they will be is9ued 9 if at all. b) In astern Azerbaijan, Kurdistan end Kernsnshah the AgriotKLt- urai iiank will buy grain in the open -rarket so as tc &gt; top struggling out of the country. In a cetera Azerbaijan the Kurds control the wheat growing areas of Mahabad, U&amp;hnu, Boiduz, Acral, Biradost, liaranauz, and a good deal of the :%ku district. They are buying uc I the wheat in those districts at from 3,200 to 5,700 riels a ton, the prices boine, higher in the districts nvnr to the frontier, s clear indication of the direction of flow. It is this wheat which the aillien would like* to kcop in the country, but th* Persian authorities ore resigned to seeing it go. Thry are sitting on their haunches in Kez&amp;leh buying the wheel which the peasants of the neighbourhood aro bringing in for safety - 'distressed cargo' which is soiling cheap ut His. 1,500 a ton. rr his, they say, is therefore tb j kairkot price whereas the real oren market price is what the Kurds outside are paying. The Kurds will get Us. 5,000 a ton if they uurry that wheat over the mountrins into Turkey. They would probably be glad to resell it on this side of the mountains for 4,0;)0 e ton. I should say there are us to 10,000 tons of it altogether, mid that,,fulling energetic action, of which there is at present no si^n/it will all disappear. Already the Iraqi Kurds \ are striking their sutoter camps and it is known they have bought large quantities to take back to Iraq. Nothing but frontier control will' kaep that in the country, and duly the Allies can provide such :control at short notice. The Persians h-ve always allowed it to be understood that the Httt-si&amp;na would prevent th© movement Southwards otf the Azerbaijan surplus grain. xarsination of actual foots does not bear this out, and now it should be finally exploded because the ihissian Consulate General told ne they estimate that Azerbaijan ought to have 35,000 tons to spare for the South. A leading landlord whom I have consulted thinks that if we really take action and are not led by the nose from one Government paper scheme to another, we could between now and spring get /50,000 tons of wheat.......50,000 tons of wheat and barley from Azerbaijan ©nd still hare enough to feed the people and for the next year f s sowings* These figures dismay the OoTernor-General; he knows quite well that if we try to approach them, he end his administration will have to bestir themselves uncomfortably and abandon many attractive local *arrangS'neftts H . Local Government . llie Oovemor-Oeneral’s prost^ete trouble atinues and he will have to face an operation sooner or later* or the moment he is somewhat better* Bilourl, head of the • itoioipality, is still absent* Ahmadi, the Governor, is said to be angling for his Job, one of the most lucrative, but for the moment the post remains in acting hands* The Ohief of Police, Ssrhang Abdullah Itaetagar, has left and Sarhang Fetullah Behpur has been nominated to succeed him* !y vlet colleague and 1 had tried (sea^^5 ) to stimulate Hastagar to stop ^xls propaganda, and encountered obatruction* The new min can hardly be leas co-operative than he was. A new Director of Commerce end Industry, one Sharif!, has arrived from Tehran* iirouzan, the Director of Finance, is always 'ill' these days; some say it is drugs, some think drink. In cither case he is not the man to secure the maximum amount of surplus wheat from this province. K? rim nastagar, Prosecutor-General in the v igh Court, Just ooulddidt bear living in Tabriz any longer# He had allied for leave.lii vain, so one day he set out for Tehran, damning the consequences. Tusuf Azima, from Bezaieh, has been appointed to his place, and doubtless he regards the move favourably aa being one stag© nearer lehran* The Chief of Customs has now reopened a Customs post at ahabad and placed a local man in charge. It isnH doing very well. A visitdr told me that the new official was sitting idle while the Kurdish Customs post not far away was buzzing with activity and taking big money. *4. ubllc -rder * There was a small bread riot at f ianeh on August *®th which the Pcviet troops helped to control. Otherwise, Eastern Azerbaijan has been quiet - no trouble from the shaheevans and no more of the ominous knifing frays between Moslems and Christians in Tabriz which occurred so frequently during the exictement of the Kurdish raids in Western Azerbaijan. The Improvement in Tabriz is attributable to close hissian military control of the streets and to a conviction, common to osieras and Christians alike, that th* ernns will soon be here. Tmt prospect quells any efferv escence among the Christians; for the Moslems it is rather a matter of holding their fire. one Moslem, however, watching a Russian film in a Tabriz cinema in the second week of September, was unable to hold his fire ?iny longer; he shot with his revolver at Stalin on the screen and got away Ip the ensuing confusion. In ©stern itzerbaijaa there is general insecurity. The Kurds control some districts completely, and even in those districts where j the gendarmes dare show themselves, e.g. Hezoieh, Ehoi and Hhahpur, the Inhabitants are kept in a state of alarm by reports of theft i and robbery, often exaggerated, and for which the Kurds are invar- f iably blamed. It must be admitted that they are often blened unjustly, that both landlords and peasants plead an exaggerated fear of the Kurds whenever they need a pretext for evading the law of the Ifmd, but even so the Kurds are mainly responsible for a state of unsettlement which must nsake Heza ihah writhe in hia exile, if it continues for long his faults will be forgotten and his memory become blessed. There is still no Persian Governor in Mehabad and the adherents of the departed Kurdish Governor, Amir assad, continue to quarrel 'with those of his rivals. It is not safe for the ordinary civilian to go to Mahabad; the least that may befall him is that a number of ‘ Turds will pile in on hia oar and demand to be taken to their viliac® where he will find others with a wander-lust who will not take f, No” * /for an answer;(Ky. Mr an answer; and indeed there is no one to say them nay$ Kianduab, in the main street, a Kurd was shot dead in the saddle as he was unslinging his rifle at sight ot some other Kurd he had sworn to kill.

That subvention has not been paid and for some time the Jalali have threatened that they would have to help themselves to some share of the world’s goods before the winter, and they have now done so raiding villages around Ivlaku. The Governor-General here told me at the end of August that he had sent Sarhang Hadivi, comnanding the gendarmerie in ‘Eastern and Western Azerbaijan, to treat with the Jalali, and to promise them payment of this subvention if they would keep quiet; he said he per sonally had a good deal of sympathy with them. A week later, after the Ushnu conference, the Persian attitude has changed and with Russian approval they were planning to use force. Goodbye subvention! 45* Consular Colleagues . The Turkith Consul-General has called on me to avow he was mistaken, and that he now thinks the Germans can’t get here this year. His Cate.su! is planning a trip to Ankara to fetch his wife. Twice he obtained from the Russians a pass for the trip to the frontier and both times he failed to start. His third application coincided with a large movement of Russian troops northwwads during the 'week ended Sept. 19th and the Soviet Vice-Consul in charge refused the permit. He explained to me that he did so in the Turkish Consul’s own interest, but his way of doing so lacked polish and the Turkish Consul General came to see me somewkat excited about it. The Soviet Vice Consul Undertook to call on him and explain. The Russian Consul General left for Tehran on August 28th and went straight on at once by plane to Moscow. He called on me and the U.S. Consul before leaving to explain that he had been bitten by a dog and must as a matter of course take the Pasteur treatment against Hydrophobia. He seemed depressed and it seemed possible that he, like some others, was under a cloud. Local rumours said at once that he was in disgrace - for holding too many gay parties! (He returned on September 21st)* Visitors . Air Vice Marshal de Crespigny, Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, arrived by plane on September 4th on a visit to General Melnik and returned on September 6th. Ten ch/ Brigadier/, Chief Engineer North-East Persia, visited Tabriz from the 5th to the 7th. The more frequent visits of his engineer officers are not recorded. Work has started on the Tabriz - Tehran road. A reconnaissance party from Baghdad, with Russian officers in company, arrived on September 14th, having reconnoitred the West, North and East of Lake Urumia and on the 15th then proceeded to reconn*oitre the South. It is good to know that Tefath Army have at last had an opportunity to make good the gaps which were discovered, so late, in military knowledge of this area. But of course at this time of year, with the weather delightfully cool and dry overhead, and the ground firm and dry underfoot, such an excursion is a picnic, as those who have had to do the journey at other seasons will readily acknowledge. 47* Consular Tours . The Governor - General of Western Azerbaijan sent me towards the end of August an urgent invitation to pay my projected visit to Rezaieh. My room was ready, he said. Unfortunately Dr. Marzeban’s flattering courtesies are not given for the sake of my blue eyes. He is always in search of support in his relations with the Russians and I hove no intention of becoming a pawn in his game against the Russians, so I found it inconvenient to go there at this4 ^stisie, f%B ind&amp;M it wa*.

Turde. kt. Uahnu. on Ooptamber 4th and for several days thereafter aoj^t, ofnot all, of the Kurdish loaders of iouth-Eestera Azerbaijan aT \Northern Kurdiatan were aaaeinbled. The occasion was the marriage of the oons of Kcra Aiui ugha, chief of the Danish, but the '^ussientt used It to obtain a general undertaking that 1) The Kurds will regain loyal friende of the misaiiiaa. 2} They would loot no ©ore. 3) They would organ!ae themselves for mutual assistance against any attacks. In jcy opinion, 'ussi^n policy towards the Kurds is being modified. In the early suumer when the Turks seerad to them to be making threatening gestures, the Kussi&amp;ns had but ono object, to strengthen their military position by cultivating the Kurds and keeping the iPersians weak. Latterly they seem to have realised the need to restore order, and to curb Kurdish insolence towards the Persians in general aj&amp;d to put a truce to the feuds between tribes; all this they would like to do without forfeiting Kurdish friendship. Two super-chiefs elected at Ushnu have tried already to give effect to this policy. Ttatr Khan of the fhikak Has tried to persuade Kurds west of the lake to stay in their mountains and leave the villagers in the plnin elone. The other super-chief is K*r* Aini of the Hemiah and he is presumed to be responsible for an effort to stop the quarrels which have kept the Itohabad-Kisuducb nreo in a &amp;tete of alarm. Ka&amp;futHaahid went, about the 18th September, with 200 horsemen of ISehabad to attempt a reconciliation between All . gbe Amir Assad, Chief of Lehboukri, Abdullah, Chief of the t'angura, and Kara Aini’s own Mamlsh. Be had no success, nor is any permanent success to be expected for any part of the Kuselan plan. nothing short of the steps of i*?ustapha Kernel and leza ehah will bring the Kurds into step with modern times. I expect there are still some of my countrymen who cherish romantic ideas of the Kurds s« sturdy* hospitable mount?*lasers. It It e false picture today; rather are they lary, &amp;1seared &amp;nd dirty, thieves ^nd liars, reedy to sell any thing for money and hopelessly divided among tbemaelvea. But their greatest cri&amp;e is that they are setting their faces ag Inst history, and tskaa aa a whole, they don’t know it. A few of tha chiefs do appear to recognise that by their present 4 viour tha Kurds ore nilscing an opportunity to show they can use freedom, and inviting stem reaction sooner or later. ?om* have threaten^ that they would resign, n&amp;i abandon their fellows to their fate. (They are of oourse men of meana by now, these chiefs). Th© Chief of tha ’iangur has been experimenting with this threat, but his people still continue to have a whale of a tirse in and around Mnhftbad, They are in two main groups ^nd so have divided Uahabad between th&lt;ap into an uprer and * lower town. They have established their own Customs Bouse, and levy dues on the considerable quantities of goods coming in from Iraq in p&amp;ymnt for grain, butter, etc., and the bales ol toxtllso arrive in Trjbriz with their stamp on them. They also levy toll on goods going the other way - e.g. on every tin of paraffin *tta, 2. Froa the town they demand presents when a marriage t^kss place amoagst thorn, collecting a few tomsnn from each house. An official report shown to me related how ten years go ease© langurs sold 104 miacals of gold at His. ZO a aisoal to siom v ha bad merehants. The vendors now demand the difference between that price, and the ^ric© tod^y, which they put at His. 300 *» miscal. And there is rauch more in the aa^e strain. 40, Morale .

Cpinions from uch a quarter'^ carry weight end this one brought gloom to the Moslem majority. One citizen was heard to declare that this Turkish statement represented a disaster for Azerbaijan; most people here think that way. The poorer classes continue to suffer from the general rise in prices. They will probably present a problem before the winter is over. s Ramadan has mad© no stir, so ftfr. The order thet the feet \*iall be publicly observed has meant that the tea shops hang a curtain over their door-way, behind which business goes on much as usual; the larger cafe® have their customers come in by a side door. In the poorer quarters there is more sincerity, but generally speaking religion end it f s observances are matters for the old folks; and this is another of the deep marks which Beta Shah has left behind hi®. The mosquee are used almost exclusively for private prayer, but the wore religious have gatherings in their houses on Thursday evenings, with mullahs to address them* It is custosnary, at these private services, to pray to &amp;l!ah for delivery from tuie present ,f, nffliction ,, | moaning, of course, the Pussians and ourselves.

The snail British com? unity has remained uninrreased by the German threat to Azerbaijan. Indeed, as a recent arrival from England, I find it if anything too much devoted to peace-time fun and grimea; but that attitude is general in a country 00 relatively little affected by the war. There are but two women left in the small American comnunity. They hfvo resir,tod the somewhat vehement pressure of the U.S. Consul to make thorn leave and intend to await events. 50. Pro pagf mdfc;. The Huaeians have arranged to exhibit their posters in the foyer of ti local cinema, but otherwise they continue to show little activity. Air flee Marshal de Croapigny’s pilot, Flight Lieutenant Milnes, added to the genar&amp;l usefullnesa of the visit by a good piece of propaganda. A certain cordiality developed ©round ray \ dinner table and General Kelnik was asked for hammer and sickle badges. In exchange for one the pilot-officer gave him ?, button, ”ith a written list of many places in Germany over which ha had carried it in raids. The General seemed deli^tod and the effect of the list was not lost. It s&amp;s unfortunate, however, that at the same meal General Melnik droppedthe bo ?bshell that two British officers had been detained at Ardabil, whither they had gone without permits.^ Axis propaganda has languished somewhat with the sloping up of Gaman progress. Moreover, although my Soviet colleague and I failed to stimulate the Chief of Police (now superseded) into direct action, w© achieved much by giving him a list of well-known ,pro-Axis propagandists. The contents leaked out at once, ano so e of the persons left, fahris uur • iadly. he lussl&amp;na say they hetm intercepted letters from them to their friends, urging th©&amp; to carry on the work; but the friends her© seem to have had a fright. Military - Ru s sian . On September 19th General ; elnik called to say'goodbye”. For some days previously his cavalry had been moving northward®, to be used presumably for raids such as He executed last winter behind the German lines. (Actually he did not nroceed far; on the Elst it was announced that h© was returning to Tabriz). A Urge-coale replacement of Russian troops is apparently in-ogress, $o far as oan be Judged the cavalry are goiag arid infantry ooming in# rerajam The conscription office is re-established in Tabriz under SarEang Hussain Mukaddam and notices hate been J ported calling on the 1921 class to r gister as from September 21st# General Fourzan is naitied as the future commander of the ne*» Tabriz division - hen eventually it is formed.

The Governor-Generei complained bitterly that the ftueslans had had the consignments unpacked more than once on the way# American . The staall group of 0.3. Kray technicians are being withdrawn from Tabriz and it appears that this route will no longer be used for the passage of motor-lorries and other supplies to Russia. They will travel East of the Caspian. Tusso-Turkiah relations # There has been wild talk about conaitiona on the Turkish frontier, but responsible Persians, Turks md Russians all say that‘tne frontier is quiet. On© rumour said that there had been a clash between Turks and Russians on sept 12th, but the secret report from the Persian custom* office at Bazurgan for this perioa stated that all was quiet find I was assured that had the incident occurred he v?ould have mentioned it. The movement of cavalry from ;*briz towards the Caucasus gave rise to reports of concentrations against the Turks. It was even said that the Turkish Foreign Minister had flown to Moscow to refuse a Russian demand for the use of the port of Trebizond, and that the Russians were thinking of taking ic by force. I have no information from H.M. Legation tnut. such a visit took place. I heve therefore assumed that It did happen end thot all the rumours depending from/are but A .ebrizi fantasies. ^ W.) H. W.

He la, also, a jauch worried zaan. 1 don’t think that he is Wry well eeen by the present politicians in power and it seems that In particular he has an enemy ia the Minister of the Interior. Be oomploined to me at length about the difficulty in getting anything done in Tehran; he had struggled for weeks t© obtain payment of the funds allotted for public works at Tubriz and in the end had to come away with more promises than cash; he couldn’t get tyres for the lorries allotted for the transport of wheat and in short he expressed disgust with the governmental machine in which small men.eaEcon^ced at strategic points, can apply regulation* to Hn hiietniK - - • • * I have exchanged visits with the new Governor, Ur* ikhmdl. fie is a fat, cheerful person, m«h given to rude guffaws of laughter.

At a large party where dinner was served at small tables I cernght his eye when the meol was nearly over i^nd xkx asked him to come and ait at my table for a Gpeii. juaoagst those at his table was a fair widow about whom there has been some curiosity amongst the more evil-minded and with whom Mr« Ahandl appeared to be mekiig quite e hit. He celled back to as ever the room: erci, male je ne peuz pas quitter Madame; elle proatitue quand Je le quitte. w Turning to the lady, who speaks no rench at all he explained to her In urkish, ind she backed him up with gestures of protestation against the Idea of hia going. -Telia,' beamed 1 r. idmadi; elle prostitue quand J© la quitte. I had hoped, if additional staff had arrived, to visit dezaieb a/palfi about this time. X should like to find out for what reasons th© Governor-Coneral there and Colonel ahin, ©onmending the HereIan troops, ere at loggerheads. The Governor- oneral’e cousin, who is Director of Customs here, came back with myaterlous hints that the colonel was frequenting Chaldean families too such, but obviously there must be more than that to cause this enmity. Then came Col. i:. bin’s telegram, published in Iran’ of *u*u*t 9th, by which he sought tc debunk the t?&gt;lea told by landlords who fear to go back to Uez^ieh to collect their share of the crops, and seek to Justify their dalliance in Tabriz and Tehran with tales of disorder. vccordin^ to the colonel, ell is quiet around ezaieh, the Kurds ere not trying to steal the landlords’ share of the crops end it is the landlords’ duty to come back. This hos provoked reaction in the form of a letter to the papers signed by forty-six persons deiasmting his removal, ass rting that the colonel has merely been enjoying himself Y&lt;hile the urtia continue to loot. But what the colonel said is good, straight soldierly stuff and nearer the truth than anything th&amp;t has yet con© fron Renal eh. It is a greet pity that this sort of thing wee not said long since. rom the outset there haa been shameless exaggeration of the Dezalah incident both for political purposes end private gain, it would be interesting to know what has happened to the millions of rials collected fmm all over Iran for the relief of distress which was largely imaginary. s he following, facta h ve come to light. he staff of th e zaieh branch of the national Bank stole :ls.470.000 at the time of tht ucsian occupation.

There are reports that a grou^ of Russian aoldiers were caught trying to steal from the Customs House, and that th ey are stealing the electric light bulbs from the street lamps, robbing gardens ana committing similar offences. It all amounts to very little, and the fact rem?ins that their behaviour is very good* 35. ■ r oneganda . i arsian heads: 1. £• 3* a « British . He try to get three main ideas into W© are bound to win It is Persia’s interest that we should win Persia must eschew religious hatreds We have failed to get these ideas into Azerbaijani beads, for many reasons. one is that we persist in treating Azerbaijan as just a part of Persia for propaganda purposes and throw it a chunk of the same cake as is handed to the rest of the country, whereas Azerbaijan needs different fere; the race and language are different. Another roason is that moat Azerbaijanis don’t, and don’t want to, believe that we can beat Hitler, are convinced that a prosperous Germany is essential for prosperity in Azerbaijan, and feel the sharper hatred for the Christians because they ore held to have common cause with the Ihissians. Gome of the older and better educated people will listen to arguments that the resources of the democracies will ensure their victory in the long run, but they say that so far as Azerbaijan is concerned there isn’t going to be any long run; there is hardly anyone who doesn’t think the Germans will be here in a few weeks. The Moslems pray for th© Germans to come in the mosques; in a Tabriz cinema recently a Moslem, at the sight of a swastika on the arm of a German soldier, ejaculated 'Gurban olaidim o nishana!’’ - would that I might be a sacrifice to that badgel Grown men rush to kiss a wireless receiver bringing in Berlin’s promise, in urki and Gsraanli Turkish, that soon Azerbaijan will be delivered by the Germans* There are feasts to celebrate German victdttea and vows to give this or that to the poor when the Germans march in.

In this interesting diary Mr.Urquhart reviews conditions in Azerbaijan and discusses the Persian officials and his consular colleagues both from the point of view of their personalities,and of their political relations with each other. He gives a good report of the food situation in Azerbaijan and a poor one of public morale. He appears to have found the Russians much less black than they had been painted.

I ARRIVED back in Tabriz on the 25th April and re-established the consulate-general on the 27th April, 1942. This diary covers the months of May and June. In future it will be written up fortnightly. I apologise for the length of this number. 2. Azerbaijan revisited. —I had left Tabriz in 1937. The intervening years have brought no great changes to the outward appearance of this province or of its inhabitants, but they have given reality to that nightmare of all politically- minded Persians : the Russians are here. I had heard so much before leaving London, at various points on the way, and at Tehran, of Russian intransigence, of their machinations and unscrupulous methods, that I approached my consular district warily, ready for trouble at the first post. I met with none. If anyone wishes to learn from my two months’ experience in Russian-occupied Azerbaijan let him register that the Russians, certainly no angels, are equally certainly no i ogres. 3. Weather. —In the early spring of every year millions of tons of water rush away to waste in Azerbaijan, much of it through narrow defiles where it could be conserved with relatively little effort. Every late spring and early summer bring hot, dusty winds and a period of anxiety for the peasants. If there is rain at frequent and regular intervals, all is well. If one or more of these necessary rains fail the crops may be parched beyond recovery. This year all is well with the crops. The thunderstorms of May and June were regular and frequent over the whole area and the harvest ought to be good. In Western Azerbaijan in particular, the peasants are now beginning to cut their best crops in twenty years. It is thought that the Kurds will not interfere before the grain has been threshed, at least, but there is some anxiety as to what may happen when the granaries are full. 4. Agriculture .—The Finance Department is preparing for me and for my Soviet colleague a statement which will, I hope, show how this year’s sowings compare with last year’s, the estimated yield, and the stocks of grain, &amp;c. remaining over from last year. 5. Food Supplies .—Legation circulars exhorting consular officers to ensure proper distribution of food supplies make somewhat academic reading at this post, particularly as regards bread supplies. There is no shortage of food in Azerbaijan so far. The quality, too, is good, generally speaking, although for a period in June there was complaint that the cheapest type of bread had been adulterated. Prices, however, are high for poor people, as the following figures show :— Commodity. June 1938 June 1941 June 1942 Rials. Rials. Rials. Wheat, per kilo 0-59 1 • 65 1-10 Bread 0-96 1-50 1 10 Rice ... 300 3-30 600 Sugar, moist 400 5-95 7-50 Sugar, loaf ... 4-30 7-00 8-50 Mutton 2-60 5-20 6-00 Ghee ... 10-80 16-00 36-00 Tea ... 44-00 70-00 120-00 Kerosine 1-35 1-65 2-65 Firewood 0-21 0-30 0-30 Charcoal 0-50 0-80 1 20 Milk 0-83 1-25 1-60 Potatoes 1-00 1-60 Fowls, each ... 4 00 10-00 14-00 Eggs, each 0-10 0-175 0-30 Prices have, of course, been rising for years, but the rate of increase has quickened sharply since the occupation and the occupying powers are blamed O2 accordingly. The most spectacular recent increase was in the price of ghee, which rocketed during the first half of June to a record figure of 160 rials a batman. The highest figure last year was 80 rials. The popular explanation is that tae Russians are buying large quantities. It may well be that Azerbaijan will not remain until the end of the war in this relatively happy food situation. Our allies to the north may become hungry if, as seems likely, there will be smaller than normal crops in the Caucasus. 1 hey are already buying more livestock than before the w 7 ar. The Governor alleges that they are paying such attractive prices for horses, donkeys, cattle and sheeps that the short-sighted peasant is over-selling, to his own future disadvantage, but anything the Governor says about the Russians is suspect. Again, there is a serious leakage of grain, through Kurdish channels, into Iraq, where the price of wheat is much higher than here. There seems also to be a certain exportation to the eastern provinces of Turkey. The Governor assures me that all necessary steps have been taken to ensure that the peasants will not conceal their grain. 6. Transport. —The Governor assures me that due attention is being given to the use of animals where motor-transport was formerly used. I propose presently to enquire more closely into the steps actually ta^ken. The war has not, of course, deprived Azerbaijan to the use of the tugs and barges on Lake Urumieh or of the 1 abriz—Julfa railway. It is possible to biing supplies, from Western Azerbaijan to Tabriz without using any motor-transpoit. There seems to be a certain reluctance to go back to animal transport foi bulk or long-distance movement of commodities. Having just risen above that stage it probably seems like real retrogression, and not merely an emergency arrangement, to have camels and pack-horses on the main roads again. Anyhow, it is so much easier to appeal to munificent America, or kind Great Britain, for lorries. Seeing so many pass through to Russia, Persians probably think that a few hundreds for Persia will eventually be forthcoming. ; 7. Local Government. —The Persian Government is short of trained civil ' servants and those it does possess do not want to serve in Azerbaijan. Persian speech, Persian manners and the bright lights of Tehran are what everybody aspires to now; that is one of Reza Shah s minor achievements. Azerbaijan has lost pride in itself, considers Turkey the mark of vulgarity, feels itself to be outlandish and crude. The officials from the south agree most heartily. They find Tabriz and Rezaieh nothing more than dull villages. Their main idea is to make money and get back to Tehran, or anyhow, down south, where there are no Russians, where they really feel at home. The post of Governor-General at Rezaieh had been too long vacant betore the Persian Government was able to persuade Dr. Marzaban at the beginning of May to set out for Western Azerbaijan. He left his family behind, as indeed all of these officials do, and arrived full of fright. Unhappy and lonely, distrustin 0- even his own servants, without competent assistants, he cuts rathe] a pathetic°figure, but he is doing well in very difficult circumstances. Mr. Halil Fahimy, the Governor-General of Eastern Azerbaijan, left Tabriz on the 27th May for 'Tehran and was still absent at the end of June. I his was a oreat pity, because he fills the post very well, whereas the Governor, who is acting for him in his absence, would be a poor substitute even if he did not smoke opium. It is realised that Mr. Fahimy had important business to discuss in Tehran notably the Kurdish problem, but people have been seeking other explanations for his prolonged absence. At one moment the rumour ran that he was to become Minister of the Interior, and a number of prominent citizens at once sent a telegram urging that Eastern Azerbaijan be not deprived of his services. Another explanation is that he needs better medical attention than he can get in Tabriz these days. . _ . , T . ^ n I have reported at length to His Majesty s Legation on the Governor, ’ Mr Muvassaghi. He is ambitious, but stupid, and gives signs of being pro- German. At mv first meeting with him he suggested that if I would deal with him he could give me better information than the Governor-General could supply. Now that he temporarily occupies the Governor-General’s position he has sought to distinguish himself in various ways, notably by clumsy attempts to get me and mv American and Soviet colleagues to comment on each other. Lnfoi Innately for Mr Muvassaghi, we have compared notes. Ihen when the American technicians here go°t drunk one June night and created an uproar he thought he had a chance to take a firm line with these foreign troops. Unfortunately for him he thought they were British, and was in too great a hurry to stop to verify his facts He telephoned this office and tried to bully the munshi, demanding[32—38] b 2 3 that steps be taken to prevent a recurrence of such behaviour by British troops. I gave him ample opportunity to pull gracefully out of his blunder, but there is no grace in him, and five days after the incident I had to write him a firm letter. Faced with firmness he gave me satisfaction at once and has since made very friendly approaches. But he is no friend of the Allies- at heart. Soviet colleague had reached this decision before I had, and both of us would be glad to see him removed. In the first months of fright and disorganisation following the occupation, Persian officials were glad to visit the British and other non-Russian Consulates in search of reassurance and comfort. They are still polite and obliging, but my impression is that they are becoming rather more stand-offish again. It may be that with time their fears of the Russians have diminished, but it is also possible that they are returning gradually to Reza Shah’s policy of aloofness. I know that Mr. Mahvi, sent from Tehran to administer funds for the relief of the pillaged villagers at Rezaieh, wanted to come and see me, but was prevented by Mr. Muvassaghi, the Governor. 8. Consular Colleagues .—The Consular Corps does not function as such, but, if it did, the Turkish Consul-General would be doyen. He has two vice-consuls, one of whom is a special service man. r l he other is being transferred to Tehran, and it is said that a consul from the Foreign Office at Angora will take his place. With such a staff, the consul-general has little to do. He spends many hours a dav listening to the wireless, and is soaked with German propaganda. In one of his more excited moments he offered to give me a written guarantee, and to back it with any sum, that the Germans would reach Tabriz this summer, and that Azerbaijan would suffer even worse vicissitudes than during the last war. Always nervous and much addicted to medicaments and injections, he spent the latter half of June in transports of excitement over German progress in Russia and in Libya, but the end of the month found him prostrate in great pam from an appareiitlv inoperable abscess in the rectum. The Soviet Consul-General is in the ranks of progressive Russian officials. His countenance does occasionally become heavy, but he is generall} responsive, and I think has become increasingly so since the treaty was signed. I consider myself fortunate in having such a colleague. The American Consul arrived in Tabriz a few days ahead of me. We have much in common. He travelled part of the way by air, possesses two suits until his heavy baggage arrives, occupies a partly-furnished house in lonely discomfort and has a quite inadequate staff. He talks Russian well. Since the death of the Iraqi Consul at the time of the Russian entry into Tabriz the Iraqi Government has Kept here a timid and very junior vice-consul. He would dearly like to get away, but apparently no consul can be persuaded to come here. He^is well disposed'and gave a very good feast on the birthday of his King. At Rezaieh the Russians had only a very green vice-consul until after the Kurdish trouble, when they sent a senior vice-consul from Tabriz, Mr. Maximoff, with the rank of consul. Mr. Maximoff is a good man, with a sense of humour, but he has to contend with some troublesome Caucasian political officers, who are attached to the consulate and who tend to make him less forthcoming than he otherwise might be. The only other consular representative at Rezaieh is the Turkish. Normally the post is held by a consul, a sick man still absent despite reports recently that he was being sent back. The post is therefore in the charge of an ardent and excitable man who is referred to here as a vice-consul, although I note that the ambassador calls him a chancellier. He makes no secret of his distrust of the Russians, and his favourite remark is “ Moi, je suis le seul temoin de leurs crimes ! ” 5 He is given to exaggeration and indiscretion in speech. He lives with a machine gun and a whole series of other firearms in his bedroom. The Russians have a vice-consul at Maku, but I have not met him. 9. Public Health .—Nothing unusual to report. Drugs are supposed to be very scarce, but the American doc*tor tells me that good stocks do exist, but that they are deliberately being held back in order to secure higher and still higher prices. 10. Public Order.—My munshi reports that, following the Kurdish trouble in Rezaieh, people were sighing for the good days of Reza Shah and wishing he might return and re-establish his wonderful order and security. I deal with the Kurdish rising elsewhere.4 No European has suffered violence since Mrs. Burdett, the 0i an American journalist and a journalist herself, was killed on the Mehabad ioao on the 24th April. . A There has been in Tabriz itself a series of brawls between Moslems and Armenians. There have been several cases of wounding with knives, but no deaths recently. The police are reported to be singularly apathetic; when trou &gt; e of any kind starts they prefer to stand aside and let the Russian patrols deal with it. , Within the last month the Russians have strengthened these street patrols, some of whom carry tommy-guns. There is no doubt that, but for their presence, the hostility which has again become acute between Moslems and Armenians would find expression in many serious incidents. ... , Apart from some fighting between gendarmes, aided by armed civilians, and some off-shoots of the Shahsevans in the Hashtarud area, public ordei has been generally well maintained in Eastern Azerbaijan. 11. Morale .—The morale of the local population is thoroughly bad. On my way from Tehran to Tabriz the only non-Russian lorries which I were carrying household effects to Tehran. Fear prevails everywhere. Those who can afford to do so have left this zone, or have at least sent their wives and children away. This fear complex has possibilities of violent reaction, from the Moslems particularly, many of whom now possess firearms. . . Russian morale here may not be quite as good as it was. 1 wice dui mg J une circumstantial reports were spread of the arrest of German spies. Actually, the arrests were.first of two, then of three, Russian deserters. Many of the troops are from the Caucasus and speak the local language. It is therefore easy for them to disappear among the local population. A Persian who has'business dealings with the Russian departments here tells me that many of the officials seem to be ill or depressed because their homes are in territory under German occupation. It is 'reported that Russian troops have been seen collecting cigarette-ends off the streets, that others have begged for money, cigarettes and bread from the local population. The general behaviour of the troops remains admirable. In my opinion, however, the Russians I meet were almost over-excited by the news of our thousand-bomber raids, by the Anglo-Soviet treaty, and ! could wish that they did not cherish such high expectations of the early opening of a second front. There must be a reaction if it is not opened before long. 12. Propaganda .—British propaganda material is now arriving in good quantity. It takes so long on the way that occasionally it is no longer interesting, or effective, but on the whole the quality is good. The pictures and posters are popular. Mr. Cook expressed the view that the propaganda methods applied in Persia o-enerally require some modification in the Russian zone, and I entirely agree. Full and frank co-operation with the Russians must be our guiding priniciple. I have therefore started a routine whereby copies of all our material are sent to the Soviet Consul-General as soon as it arrives. He is pleased by the loyalty towards his country which our material shows; the picture of Stalin, in particular, was most successful. After some discussions M. Koulagenkov has offered to help with the distribution and exhibition of our pictures and posters, not only in Tabriz, but in other towns. He has started a news-sheet in Persian and Russian, will submit daily to us for approval any item of British news received, and will publish such items for us as we may wish to supply. He will also secure, on occasions, the use of the shop-window where Russian books and papers are shown. . . . . . Russian propaganda is limited to posters, to the recently started news-sheet and to the sale by a friendly Armenian of some Russian books. Their effort is small compared with ours. Axis propaganda, apart from wireless broadcasts, which I need not describe, consists in rumour-mongering by friendly-to-the-Axis Persians, by the chalking ui) of swastika signs, by the posting of notices unfriendly to the Allies and by devices whereby pieces of paper can be folded to represent the swastika. One I saw was said to have come from Tehran. It bore phrases such as “ Come, dear Adolph,” in Persian. But these things are trifling compared with the propaganda value of German military successes. Although the Persian broadcast from Berlin is jammed people here receive and understand the German broadcasts in Turkish. 13. Trade .—Azerbaijan had come to depend for her prosperity on the German market, and the closing of that market has meant heavy loss. Tabriz, the Tabrizis say, is at the blind end of a cid-de-sac so far as trade is concerned.5 The following notes are based on information supplied by the manager here of the Imperial Bank of Iran :— All bazaars have been quiet except for a period of some ten days at the beginning of June, when there were active dealings, especially in imported goods. All commodities registered a rise of up to 30 per cent., but there have been reactions since then, and in the last week of June there was a general fall in values of about 10 per cent. Dealings in carpets have been greatly impeded by the recent law requiring exporters to guarantee the import of foreign goods to the value of their exports. The export and import trades are handled by quite different sets of merchants; a carpet exporter knows nothing of the import trade and cannot guarantee the import of goods unless he is able, and permitted, to have an arrangement whereby an importer will take over the obligation to import. There is no market now except Russia for the dried fruits, wool, cotton and skins which formerly went to Germany. The Russians are taking advantage of their buying monopoly to fix prices as low as possible, and exporters say the Russian prices yield little profit and sometimes involve loss. Ihey do not therefore want to supply Russia. The only imports during recent months have come from Russia, consisting mainly of sugar, earthenware, medicinal and piece goods. 14. Consular Visits and Tours .—It is now an established routine for con sular officers in Tabriz, the Iraqi excepted, to see each other every few days. These exchanges are sometimes useful, but quite frequently they are a waste of time And the way in wffiich men like the Turkish Consul-General discuss world politics would be entirely ludicrous if it were not at times so dangerous. The Soviet Consul-General visited Rezaieh during the Kurdish disorders there in May. He has recently made short tours to points nearer Tabriz, where Russian posts are established ‘to deal with points arising between the military and the Persian civil authorities. I have made only one sortie frofn Tabriz so far, namely, to Rezaieh, from the 15th until the 20th May, ostensibly to call on the new Governor-General, but in reality to find out what was behind the commotion over there. I stayed with the French Mission, where I was fed with good food, good wine of the country and stories of massacre and doom. In the course of my visit I exchanged calls with the various authorities, received visits from Moslems, Armenians and Assyrians, and heard their tales of persecution and fear, visited some of the pillaged villages and generally tried to show myself at places where there was supposed to be danger from the Kurds, a danger which I knew to be almost non-existent. When I got to Rezaieh I found the Persians and Russians at a deadlock. Each was waiting for the other to make the first move for the establishment of mixed military and gendarme posts, and neither was doing anything efiective towards getting the peasants back to their villages. I was able to bring them together and to make a beginning. In other ways I felt less satisfaction over the results of my visit. I did my best to steer a middle course between Russians and Persians, but inevitably my actions had some semblance of investigating what the Russians were doing, what games they were playing with the Kurds. Although the Russian commandant put on a concert in the town theatre at seven hours’ notice, and although the consul was very cordial and helpful, I had less success with the political officers, who kept a close watch on my movements. I have a somewhat indefinite promise of a vice-consul later on. If it is kept I propose, subject to approval, to go to Baku in company with the Soviet Consul-General in August, and I would like to go to Angora, too, just to see the conditions on both sides of the frontier, in so far as they have a bearing on smuggling and possible movement of goods from Persia to Germany through Turkey. I am not satisfied that the Russians are sufficiently alert in this matter. 15. The following notes are based on local observation only. I see no print and have no means of following the trend of relations, in the wide sense of the term, between the countries represented in Azerbaijan : — Russo-Persian Relations .—The main points of difficulty during the past two months have arisen from— {a) The Kurdish question. (5) Persian desire to increase their local military strength. (c) Alleged, Soviet attempts at political penetration. (d) Commercial matters.6 (a) It will be recalled that at the end of April four smallish ^rdishtnoe^ inhabiting the frontier district west of Rezaieh descended on the bhiah viUages, routed the Persian gendarmes, advanced on Rezaieh itself and lor weeks tieia control of the surrounding region. They did not touch the Kara-Sunni or m Christian villages. . They generally began by demanding the surr f nder Kf ot . ^ weapons alleged to have been given to the Shiahs by the Government or obtained when the Persian army was dissolved; they always ended by pillaging. The Persians made the most of the revolt in order to gam as much sympathy as possible against the Russians and in order to strengthen their case for being allowed to send, more troops to Azerbaijan. They accused the Russians of having instigated the revolt and of having supplied the Kurds with arms and ammumtiorL They accused the Kurds of atrocities which were never committed. Various suggestions that the Kurds, the Christians and the Russians were m league against the Shiah Moslems served the purposes of Persian solidarity, but may have sown seeds of serious trouble for the now relatively small Christian minorities latei ^6^8 qu it e clear that the Russians have reasons of their own for favouring the Kurds The Shahsevans in Eastern Azerbaijan are quite as unruly as the Kurds, but they have not been permitted to revert to the old practice of pillage in the springtime. I think it is probably true that it n Turkish frontier which makes the difference m the Russian attitude m Westein Azerbaijan. I do not think that the Russians are playing any political game with the Kurds, who are too divided, while the Christians are too few. to form the foundation on which a separate State could be engineered. My belief is that the Russians are now fully preoccupied with military short-term considerations, and that they fear a stab in the back from Turkey-and Persia. I hey must, after all remember what happened to Poland. For that reason they fear to allow the Persians to build up a large military strength and they want the Kurds to be stron' so long as them is. hi their view, any chance that the Turks may pm the Axis reiving on them to put up some sort of fight against the Turks m defence of their own territorv. Thus, when they saw that the Persian Government had bought over the more important Kurdish tribes, and was planning to crush the others with armed civilians helping the gendarmes, they did not the bok of things at all They probably felt they could not afford to count for nothing among the Kurds. At the least, they were guilty of standing aside and doing nothing to help the Persians; they may have given the Kurds help and eneouiage- ment but I am quite sure they did not at any time intend matters to go as fai as they did. The panic which swept through the villages was largely created by the Persians themselves. , , ^ ^ , , i Whatever their relations with the Kurds, the Russians to-day stand condemned in the minds of the Shiah peasantry and. indeed of the bulk of the population of Azerbaijan of being responsible for the Kurdish rising and all the 5 loss it has entailed for the very peasants who had expected the Russians to be their champions. I think we can put at rest for the duration of the wai at least our fears about Russian political penetration here and I repeat what I wished to convey in one of my telegrams to the Foreign Offtce—that we shall be foolish if we allow the Turks, or the Persians either for that matter, to keep on nlaving that much-thumbed card. „ T , . . ' (7)i The Russians do not seem to mind the presence of Persian troops at Ardabil but they do dislike having them at Tabriz or Rezaieh The Persians complain that the force which recently went to Rezaieh is so hedged about as to he more or less powerless. A Persian general is shortly coming to Tabriz and no doubt Persian troops will shortly be stationed here . From Ardabil and Rezaieh it is reported that the Russians keep a close check on the type and numbers of weapons held by the troops and gendarmes. The Soviet Consul-General has expressed concern about the reported arming of more bands of villagers in various parts of Azerbaijan. M The Persians allege that the Russians have sought to undermine the authority of their Government bv encouraging the formation of political clubs and bv enrolling candidates for Russian citizenship. They have made much of a remark attributed to the young Russian Vice-Consul at Rezaieh who, when a deputation of leading Moslems approached him at the time of the Kurdish attack is quoted as asking : “ And where have you been these eight months? Thus, the Persians say, do the Russians bring pressure on local people to put their names on the consulate bKiks-icai sprang up after the occupation are as pood as dead to-day, and that the Russians have refused them financial support. I have no doubt that the Russians would have been quite pleased to see theseclubs grow strong, but they do not appear to have taken any great trouble to keep them alive. As regards enrolment of candidates for citizenship. I still keep an open mind. It is at least possible that the initiative has come from persons anxious to curry favour and that ignorant persons have given inaccurate accounts of what takes place as regards enrolment. More important still is the fact that patriotism, as usual, is thriving under adversity. I have been impressed by the increased sense of solidarity among the Moslems, not merely religious solidarity, but rather political. The threat of -- becoming detached by Russia has quickened the desire for Persian unity which Reza Shah sought to foster. It is a threat which has been exaggerated, and which the Persians would have been wise to invent even if the Russians had not given them some justification. The Kurdish disorders were similarly exaggerated to exploit national, and if possible foreign, feeling against the Russians and the Kurds. It is a matter of great interest that when a Deputy, labatabay, said that the trouble at Rezaieh had been greatly exaggerated, the Chamber showed every sign of wrath, to the extent, I believe, of violence; but from the meagre reports at mv disposal he was nearer the truth than any other speaker in the Chamber. The Persian Government has many difficulties, but apart from the Kurds there is more loyalty to it in Azerbaijan to-day than when Reza Shah was in power, and the Persianisation which he sought to impose is progressing faster to-day with the Russians here than he was able to make it. The people want it now; they didn’t then. (d) The Chief of the Customs here has told me that he reproached M. Agronoff with making enormous profit from the resale of the sugar supplied by the British, and that the Soviet trade delegate replied simply to the effect that there was a war on and that Russia needs rials. One constant Persian complaint is that the Russian frontier is virtually open since the Russians do not allow the Persian customs officials to control exports and imports properlv. Russo-Turkish Relations .—1 have His Majesty’s Minister’s instructions to do everything possible to improve relations between the Russians and the Turks here. I accordingly see my Turkish colleague frequently, too frequently for my liking in view of his propensity for distorted and sensational reporting. The Turks I have met in Azerbaijan fear and obstinately distrust the Russians. I hold out little hope of being able to convert them and, indeed, I have to confess that a good deal of my effort has to go in resisting the Turk’s attempt to persuade me that his view of the Russians is held by many British officials. For their part the Russians know that the Turkish Consul-General makes no secret of his conviction that the Germans are bound to break through, and they suspect that he has even talked with the local authorities about the situation which might arise if the Russians did have to leave. I have done my best to persuade °my Russian colleague that M. Ramazanoglou’s anxieties are exaggerated by the abnormal state of. his health, that they are primarily for the safety of his own country, that he is not pro-German; but it is at such talk that M. Koulagenkov's face goes wooden. All the courtesies are, of course, observed. When the Turkish Vice-Consul fell sick at Rezaieh the Russians sent a military doctor to see him, there being no qualified local doctor available, and the Turks were very grateful. Anglo-Russian Relations .—A set of negative ideas such as I possessed about the Russians when I came here (see paragraph 2) was poor equipment for anyone hoping to develop cordial and fruitful relations. Something positive was most desirable. Admiration for the performance of the Russian army, for the discipline and behaviour of the troops here offered an obvious and easy beginning. One’s inward confidence of being able to make some progress increased with the realisation that there is a distinction to be made here between pure Russians such as General Melnik and M. Koulagenkov, and Caucasians, who are more Communist than the real Russians and who must take a good deal of the blame for the less reassuring aspects of Russian policy here. I am glad to say that the political agents seem to be losing power, and that the general and the consul- general seem freer now to take decisions of their own. Then as regards Russian methods, e.g., the resale of our sugar, they are certainly not Bank of Fnglanct, but then the Russians have a sharper awareness than we British of the sternness of the times and their needs are keener; and there is merit in a realism which knows what is necessarv and goes straight after it. And so in the end I came to examine critically the ideas with which I was originally furnished and found no difficulty in discarding or modifying them. At the end of May. however, certain incidents which need not be described again seemed to block the way towards better understanding with the Russians.8 They were the typical fruit of that negative outlook which I have found it necessary to discard and which must damn the chances of success with the Russians for anyone who holds it. The question was how to get clear of the morass of mutual suspicion and lack of frankness with which so many British and Russians, the soldiers particularly, regarded each other. I was completely at a loss how to proceed until, after a blank week or two, the signature of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty was announced. I at once exchanged congratulations with my Soviet colleague and sought an interview with the general. I saw him next day and he instantly accepted my suggestion that, as a gesture of friendliness, he should invite the General Officer Commanding, Tenth Army, to Tabriz. General Quinan came here on the 24th June and left on the 27th June. I am leaving it entirely to him to report on his visit, but I can say that it has been helpful for me and, I trust, will prove to have been useful both for the Tenth Army and for the Royal Air Force Command in Iraq.

I HAVE reported to you certain vague rumours about trouble between the Persian authorities and the Shahsevans, but until to-day I have not met anyone who was able and willing to tell me exactly what the trouble was. This morning I had a visit from the Governor of Khoi, and I now have the honour to put before you the gist of what he said. I would earnestly request that he should not be quoted to anyone as the source of the following information, because the quotation would probably be repeated to him and almost certainly make him less communica tive in future. 2. Mr. Kabiri has no Shahsevans in the area under his charge, but he is a member of a leading Maragha family and himself owns property there. He has every interest to keep himself informed of what takes place in the Maragha district, and he has the best sources of information to draw upon. 3. Eastwards of Maragha lies Hastarud, a mountainous district largely unsurveyed as yet, where live pastoral tribes, half Kurd, half Shahsevan. These,, like all 'the tribes of Azerbaijan, acquired fire-arms when the Persian army was defeated, and, according to the Governor of Khoi, it was decided to apply to them the Hashimi method, the same which has had such disastrous results around Pezaiefn X~foree of gendarmes was organised to go against them, and civilians from the Maragha district were armed to strengthen and support the gendarmes. The landlords of Maragha and their men combined readily with the gendarmes for this expedition, because the tribes are relatively weak and because there was a definite prospect of acquiring something in the way of loot. The tribes at first did not resist; they surrendered some weapons. When, however, the gendarmes used violence to the extent of beating the women, in order to make them hand over more guns, the tribesmen turned on them and routed them. Thereupon a larger force of gendarmes, with more armed civilians, was despatched, and this time the tribesmen were beaten. Their families were scattered, their goods pillaged and their sheep, to the number of 30,000, according to the Governor, were driven away. All this happened soon after Nbvruz, say two months ago. Now a band of sixty dispossessed but armed men are at large, looting wherever they find anything to loot. Recently they had a fight with gendarmes, and it is said that they were chased away in the direction of Kurdistan, a region where there are already more than its share of lawless men with rifles in their hands. 4. The Governor was not able to tell me anything about the trouble reported from Ardebil, but I find it easy to believe that the authorities may be at logger- heads with the tribes in Ardebil and in Khalkhal. there was always trouble in the old days, when the tribes began moving in the spring and early summer, and2 it is evident that for the time being Persia has reverted to the old days of tribal unruliness and insecurity.t. 5. I took this oppomnity to ask the Governor what was the sequel to the killing of two Russians tty Kurds, of which he had informed me when I visited him at Khoi on the 20th May (see the penultimate sub-paragraph of my despatch Ko. 15 of the 24th May). He confirmed that the Russians took no steps to punis^g^ the killers, that they had chosen the way of negotiation. The leaders concerned had been brought to Khoi to meet him and had agreed to return the stolen animals. Now, he says, all is quiet. 6. Having thus, with obvious satisfaction, described the state of affairs in his district the Governor spoiled the effect by confessing that when he had invited the chiefs to tell them about the passage of the Persian troops through Khoi to Rezaieh, one of them, the important Kotas Agha, did not respond. More than that, his men pillaged a village in the neighbourhood on the 31st May, just after the troops had passed. Gendarmes from Salmas had later managed to kill three of Kotas Agha’s hfen (in some cowardly ambush, according to another informant), and after some negotiation the Russians had permitted the Kurds to recover the bodies. The Governor of Tabriz, who called on me immediately afterwards, continued the story from this point. He had just received a telegram reporting that Kotas Agha' was planning an attack on the town of Salmas itself, and stating that the commander of the Soviet detachment there had given the warning to the local commander of the gendarmerie. Reinforcements had been sent. It hardly seems likely that the Kurds would attack a town where Russian troops are quartered. 7. I mentioned to Mr. Kabiri a telegram which the Governor of Tabriz received two days ago, and which stated that some Maku Kurds had begun to pillage. Mr. Kabiri was not able to say much about it beyond the fact that some Jalili Kurds, the same whom Reza Shah exiled to Kazvin and who moved back, empty-handed, as soon as he had gone, were known to have started looting. But he was anxious to tell me a frontier story concerning a Kurd, a Mullah Mahmud, who lives in a village some 8 miles from the Turkish border. Being involved in a feud with some other Kurds, he and his family invited relatives from across the frontier to come and help them. A fight took place, and Mahmud’s side was worsted. Some fifty animals were driven away from his village across the frontier 'V and sold in Turkey, but, more serious, one of the Kurds from Turkey was killed. Mahmud subsequently received a visit from a Turkish bimbashi and two gendarme officers, who, according to the Governor, offered to arrange that Mahmud should have further help from Turkey against his enemies m Persia. The Turks withdrew when the Kathoda protested against their intrusian into Persian territory. The Governor’s deduction was that the Turks, or some of them, are interested to feed the fires of Kurdish unrest in this country, but I think it more likely that they were concerned to investigate the death of a Turkish citizen and that if they offered help it probably meant that they would try to recover the stolen animals. The story illustrates the state of disorganisation in the frontier zone. 8. I questioned the Governor about smuggling across the Turkish frontier, and he said that without doubt a great deal was being illegally exported, and particularly grain and animals. The Russians were buying a good deal, but more than twice what they were taking from the Khoi and Maku regions was going to Turkey. There are tribes who have kinsmen in Turkey, and it is easy for them to organise this traffic. The Governor went so far as to say that the peasants around Maku had sold to the extent that they had not enough left for themselves. Until recently Maku was in the district of the Governor of Khoi; now a separate governorate has been set up, and Mr. Kabiri professed to be anxious to have j Maku put back under his control. He said that he had told Tehran that unless this was done he could accept no responsibility for the leakage into Turkey of the produce of his district. I doubt whether he could do much, as things are, to stop that leakage, even if Maku were in his district again, and I suspect that his protest to Tehran was more of an intimation that they must not expect him to do anything to remedy matters, rather than a genuine request for the restoration of Maku. 9. It surprised me to hear a Persian Governor place the blame for the trouble with the Shahsevans so squarely on the shoulders of the gendarmes and their civilian helpers. Mr. Kabiri bluntly accused them of using the order to3 disarm the tribes as an opportunity for seizing the tribesmen’s flocks. I think that perhaps he forgot he was an official and spoke as a property-owner, with a good deal to lose if serious trouble ensues in the Maragha district. His statement is in direct contrast with the official Persian version, which always begins with the accusation that the tribes were guilty of looting, but it corresponds closely ^^■•iyith the Russian explanation of how the trouble began in the Rezaieh district, /ou will recollect that Serhang Hashimi recruited gendarmes and armed civilians there for the purpose of disarming the Kurds and that the first, and virtually the only, achievment of the gendarmes was to kill and rob some Kurds bound for Mehabad on business. Indeed, Mr. Kabiri’s remarks were so un-Persian in their form that I wondered at one stage whether he might not have come under Russian influence, or be giving me a prepared story for quotation to the Russians. I think the chances are that he was sincere, but I was careful to make suitable remarks which could bear repetition either to Persians or to Russians. 10. Assuming that there is truth in what the Governor said. Mr. Kabiri’s version of the proceedings against the tribes east of Maragha provides one more illustration of the utter worthlessness of the gendarmerie, as well as proving the Russian case that in the matter of looting there is little to choose between the Moslems and the Kurds, except that the Kurds are more effective. The only remedy which I can suggest is a reconstituted gendarmerie under foreign officers. The present force has no health in it whatsoever; it is rotten throughout. It does not matter that the orders given to it are in the public interest, because when entrusted with their execution it perverts them into occasions for brutality and robbery. Honest Persians admit this. I understand that an attempt is being made to secure order in Kurdistan by giving the Kurds the responsibility for guarding the roads, but this cannot be entirely satisfactory, or more than a temporary solution at best. Foreign officers of the right type might make something of these same Kurds, however, and, being free from all taint of racial or religious feud, they might be able to secure co-operation between disciplined Kurds and a rehabilitated Persian gendarmerie where no Persian officer can hope to succeed.

Tehran, June 1, 1942. Enclosure. Consul-General Urquhart to Sir R. Bullard. (No. 15. Confidential.) Tabriz, May 24, 1942. THE reports about trouble with the Kurds in Western Azerbaijan which began to reach Tabriz from the 28th April onwards were alarmist, often contra dictory and generally unreliable. It was clearly desirable that I should go to Rezaieh as soon as possible and see what was actually happening, but I decided not to rush into the middle of the matter too quickly. One of my reasons for so deciding was that both the Russians and the Persians were eyeing the new British Consul-General with something more than an innocent curiosity, and it would have been only too easy in the first days after my arrival to create an impression, possibly difficult to correct later, that my zeal had a bias for one side or the other. In particular, I feared that the Russians would be suspicious of a visit to Rezaieh at a time when the Persians were claiming that what was to be seen there was the proof that the Russians were trying to detach Western Azerbaijan, at the time, too, when the Russian Consul-General had verv properly gone there to try to improve the link between the Russian military and the local civil authorities. While I had no intention of surrendering my right to travel in my district freely, it seemed good to me to find a normal excuse for making the journey, and the arrival of the new Governor-General provided it. He asked me to allow him a few days to take up his functions and then, after an exchange of plain language telegrams which would, I knew, be read by persons interested m my movements, I went to Rezaieh on the 15th May. I had intended to return on the 19th, but I stayed one day longer in the hope of being able to report the beginning of a movement of the refugees back to their villages. 2. I offered a seat in my car to my I nited States colleague, whose own car has not yet arrived, but he did not accept. 3. My visit was an interesting one and, I hope, useful. I propose to submit a detailed account as soon as possible, but so much of my time is taken up with cyphering and office work that it may be delayed. I am therefore giving you now my main conclusions. Before doing so, however, I think it will be useful to describe briefly the background against which these recent events have taken place, and the present atmosphere. 4. It is vividly within living memory that the last war brought the Russians and the Turks into conflict in Azerbaijan, that disorders ensued in which the civilian population suffered, the Christians particularly. The local officials of the two countries are distrustful of each other to-day and the public cannot fail to know it. To the ordinary man there is nothing far-fetched in the idea that they may again be fighting one another, and that the civilians will again run the risk of massacre. Whatever his race or religion, the ordinary man in these parts is fear-ridden, easily startled by rumour. If he is a Shiah he is a poorish [30—53] B2 W Jt X * specimen, morally and physically, probably an opium smoker, and abject coward unless he is overwhelmingly strong, and then he shows all the violent brutality of the coward. If he is a Christian, whether, A^fnenian or Assyrian, he has behind him three or four generations of *th§ decline of his people in this regiom^ of suffering and massacre at the hands of Turks,-Kurds and Persians. If he a Kurd, he knows that his people cannot stand up to the Mustapha Kemals and the Reza Shahs, that, though the present offers a chance for some to wipe off old scores with the gendarmes, to pillage, and even to talk insolently to the Persian officials in the jargon which some of them have learned at Baku, the future is very uncertain. Indeed, all of them see the future as uncertain and dangerous because all of them think there is a strong chance that the Germans will break through on the Caucasus front, that the Russians will have to leave and that there will be a period when anything might happen before the Persians, with German help, get firm control and put the Kurds and Christians back where they were, under the gendarmes. 5. It only made matters worse that many civilians were able to acquire Persian army rifles and ammunition. Althougtn no doubt the Kurds are better armed than the others, all of them have weapons and all of them consider that what is a measure of prudent precaution for their sect is an act of aggression when others do likewise; this is particularly the case as between the Kurds and the Shiahs, who circulate, and end by believing, very exaggerated tales about the arsenals held by the other. 6. In these circumstances the recent Kurdish outbreak has had an emotional effect out of proportion with the number of Kurds involved, the numbers killed and the damage done. They are circumstances in which it is difficult to form a sane and balanced judgment, hence, I think, the extravagance of my Turkish colleagues and the violent folly of Persian officers like Serhang Hashimi. Indeed, almost any foolishness can be expected from Rezaieh unless the Persian officers now r going there are exceptional men; at the best of times they are poorly equipped to resist suspicion, rumour and intrigue and they must, being frustrated men, be expected now to have less sense of balance than ever. 7. I now r summarise briefly the results of my observations :— Origins of the Outbreak .— The hand of Reza Shah was firm, but it was not just. It weighed heavily on the Kurds, less heavily on the Assyrians, while still making it plain that they had no hope of equal treatment with the Shiahs. Its instrument was the gendarmerie. When the firm hand was lifted the gendarmerie disappeared and the Kurds dug up their hidden rifles. More than that, they acquired rifles and ammunition from the disbanded Persian troops. Then came General Cupal and later Serhang Hashimi, literally shouting aloud their intention to disarm the Kurds, to re-establish the status quo. When Hashimi began to recruit gendarmes from among the local Shiah population and to give arms to others so as to build up a numerous force, and when these undisciplined men began by killing the first Kurds they tried to disarm-—two men travelling to Mehabad to buy goods—the tribes concerned were stung into action. That is the Russian version, and. even if it is not perhaps all the story, I accept it as substantially correct. The Persians, on the other hand, say that the Russians have since their arrival made a definite attempt to seduce the people from its loyalty to the Shah, that the Shiahs did not respond, and that the Russians accordingly made up their minds to get rid of them, using the Kurds for the purpose. There are grains of truth in this, but I feel perfectly sure that, while they have shown regard for the Kurds and others who are well disposed to the Soviet, the Russians never planned the expulsioji of the Shiahs from their villages. I have no doubt that they were astonished by the extent of the panic whidh follow^ed the attack of the Kurds on the gendarmes. It is most regrettable that the men on the spot have remained inactive; most probably they are under remote control from Kuibyshev, which failed to realise what was happening either from lack of information or from incredulity. But the Persian Government has little right to complain. At a moment when it ought to have had its best men on the spot and to have shown zeal and leadership it remained silent and the post of Governor-Genera! stood empty because no one could be persuaded to fill it willingly. As regards the accusation that the Russians gave the Kurds ammunition, I confess I am in doubt, but quite definitely the verdict must be “not proven.”3 /■s Course of Events .—It is not possibie to give a reliable account of the progress of the fighting. The villagers are unreliable, the Persian official almost more so, the Russians non-communicative. I feel satisfied, however, that the Kurdish ^ittack fell first on some newly established gendarme posts in the Baranduz valley, ^ Ind that some of the Shiah villagers tried to help the gendarmes. The gendarmes were beaten and the Kurds set about trying to make the Shiahs give up their arms, alleged to have been distributed by Serhang Hashimi or obtained from the Persian army last autumn. The most extraordinary panic set in and villages were evacuated by the Shiahs with or without the firing of the first shot. Pillage ensued, of course. But somehow the word went round that the Kara Sunnis and the Assyrians and Armenians had nothing to fear, that they could “ stay put and that word was sufficiently definite to enable them to resist the panic, and even to dare, as many of them did. to receive the goods and cattle, sometimes even the owners themselves, from the neighbouring Shiah villages. With the Russian political officers at my side it was quite impossible to enquire just how this intelligence got around with any hope of a useful reply, but I may be able to discover the truth later. The Kurds several times came on right to the outskirts of the town. The last occasion was on the 11th May, when both the Russians and the local gendarmes stood forth to meet them. In the fusillade a Russian soldier was shot in the leg, but the Russians said it was a gendarme who did it, firing wildly, and asked that the relatively untrained gendarmes be made to deposit their arms at their depot and not carry them about. They undertook to maintain order and their request was agreed to. Thus did the Kurds succeed in defeating and disarming the gendarmerie, and it is a fact that since the 11th May they have been quiescent. Present Condition of Affairs—1 have nothing to add to my telegraphic reports about the number of deaths and the damage done. As regards atrocities, I would add that I still do not believe that even the one woman whose case was mentioned by the Minister of War had her breasts cut off before she was killed. I similarly doubt if there was a single case of rape by the Kurds, and I blame Christian riff-raff for some cases reported recently. It is, however, true that some men had hot irons applied to make them disclose where the rifles were, but on the whole it would be difficult to imagine a greater panic, a more abject flight, for so little killing. Only the unhealthy circumstances which I have described in paragraphs 4. 5 and 6 can have produced the present results. The important fact, however, as I have tried to persuade my Russian colleague, is not that the panic was unjustified and the results exaggerated, but that many thousands of people did, in fact, flee from their homes and are, most of them, still in the town. It seemed to me when I was looking at their houses, their fields and vineyards a week ago that, if only they would get back to work at once, the damage' would by po means be disastrous. The Governor-General was spending 50.000 rials daily among them. He said there were 48,000 persons, and there were certainly great numbers crowded into that small town. I have put the figure at 30,000 and in the absence of any sort of statistics it is a guess as good as any other. There were reports of typhoid and dysentery among these refugees, under a score all told, so that there seemed, when I was there, to be no immediate threat to health; but the Governor-General’s dole was not sufficient for their needs and they were killing off animals both for food and for sale; they were also going forth during the day and cutting down trees, which represent capital, and which, in any case, were not their property. The less worthy elements were stealing on the one hand and trying to get a bigger dole from the Governor-General on the other. Altogether the situation was unhealthy, and its most remarkable feature was the absence of any suggestion of leadership from the Persian officials, although every day’s delay meant heavy loss. Despatch of Persian Troops .—The news that the Russians had agreed to the despatch of a substantial Persian force caused excitement, especially among the Shiahs and the Kurds. The latter responded with the news that their kinsmen, now migrating from Iraq to the Persian uplands, were coming over “ like ants ” to their* assistance. For their part, the Shiahs were already savouring their revenge on the Kurds, a bloody one, and were by implication blackening the faces of the Russians and their friends, since Persian arms were to restore that order which, according to them, the Russians had deliberately disturbed, and which even their best friends had to admit they had failed to maintain, although it was [30—53] b 2in their power to do so. There seemed to me to be a strong probability that, if the Persian troops came to Rezaieh while the villagers were still there ip their thousands, not even the wisest of commanders could prevent an outburst oi emotion w^hich might produce troublesome incidents. Yet when I got there a deadlock between the Governor-General and the Russians was apparent ovei th£^ establishment of joint road guard posts, a.nd neither side was making any move- to persuade the villagers to go home. . Since I began writing this despatch I have had a conversation w ith the Persian commander. He seems to be unusually reasonable for a Persian officei, and I think he will do his best to avoid incidents. I do not think he is a strong character, however, and I doubt if he possesses the perseverance which his task will demand of him. , . His troops are moving northwards slowly because his lorries cannot lilt the whole force at the same time, so the sections are being leap-frogged. Moreover, some of his tank-carrying vehicles have had difficulty in negotiating the tortuous approaches to certain narrow bridges. He cannot now be in Rezaieh before the 30th or the 31st, and I can only hope that by then the majority of the villagers will have become tired of the town and plucked up the courage to go home. Tlie Persian Government'’s Position in Western Azerbaijan. —Despite the Government’s neglect of this distant province, despite the incompetence and folly of its officers, I found its position surprisingly strong for the moment. I suspect that the Governor-General here has been more active these past months among the more important Kurdish tribes than is generally known, and that the sugar, presents and appointments which he has given to the chiefs of the larger tribes have been more effective than medals and trips to Baku. The line, of course, had to be drawn somewhere and for face-saving purposes the Government had to establish its authority over some of the Kurds, preferably, I would suppose, those within easy reach of Rezaieh. Unfortunately, as it has turned out, the line was drawn a trifle too high and by his violent foolishness, perhaps also by his inability to secure Russian goodwill, Serhang Hashimi failed signally to establish the Government’s authority even in the Rezaieh plain. The big tribes like the Karapapak, Momish, Piran, Mangur, Denboukri, Faisullah beghli and a large section of the Shekak are on the Government’s side. It was the smaller tribes, the Begzadeh, the Herki, Mamedi and Hinari, which caused the trouble. They would normally be punished by the despatch of troops to their villages, but this is not the moment for that. For one reason, the 1,500 men which these Kurds can, at a pinch, put into the field would be more than a match for the force now going to Rezaieh with Russian approval. The first complication would be a Persian demand for many more troops, and then, if they gained the upper hand, they would behave in a manner whidh the Russians would not approve. The wise solution is to extend to these discontented Kurds the benefits which have kept the larger tribes friendly, so as to gain time. The Governor-General at Rezaieh thinks it can be done, but the Russians must, at the same time, allow the Persians some means of saving their faces. Position of the Russians. —The Russians came to Azerbaijan with all the prestige which their claim to be the protectors of the peasantry gave them. They have quite lost it, because to the simple peasants of Azerbaijan, and they are the bulk of the population, the results speak for themselves. For them the coming of the Russians, for that matter the Anglo-Russian occupation, has meant heavy loss and the quickening of old hatreds and fears. The Christians abhor the recent disorders almost as much as the Shiahs. They have derived no present benefit from them; on the contrary, they have a lively fear that the day of reaction may come as it has always tended to come in the past. Only the Kurds can be supposed to be happy with matters as they now are, but the best of them are in the Persian Government’s pay and, if the Persians are wise, they will make an effort to find a means of pacifying those who have shown themselves strong enough to make serious trouble. If. however, the Persians now commit some act of folly against the rebel Kurds, they may very easily alienate some of those now friendly and cause more than the present small proportion to turn to the Russians as their hope. I have little doubt, however, that it is their conception of their military necessities, and not any political theory or ambition, which has determined Russian policy latterly i.n Azerbaijan. The political officers are no doubt at work in a routine fashion, but events have caused them to lose ground so markedlyI V that there must be some overwhelmingly strong reason for continuing in the present policy. I have suspected that Russian military strength in Azerbaijan, far from being an increasing threat to Turkey, is low and that they are genuinely ^^orried about the Turkish frontier themselves. If we were in their place, sharing ^JPeir apprehensions about Turkey, hearing perhaps of the chauvinistic remarks which Turkish officials are capable of making, I think we, too, should consider it our duty to neglect no means and to examine the possibility that the Kurds might serve for defensive operations. I have noted from your telegrams to the Foreign Office that the Persian authorities and the Turkish Ambassador have suggested that the Russians have considered using the Kurds against the Turks; it seems to me that this need not be a matter for excitement or resentment in any quarter. Both Turks and Persians whom I have met say that the Kurds have no military value in the modern sense and I think the Russians themselves would agree that for attack they have none, although it might be argued that for defence, on their own ground, they might be of some use. Hence, possibly, their tenderness for the Kurds. I have several times, in conversation with my Russian colleagues, sensed a revulsion when the possibility of military action against the Kurds was threatened. I therefore concluded that they would at all costs avoid hostilities with them. The signs of a firmer attitude which I saw at Rezaieh, and the Russian casualties—tw T o killed—in a brush with the Kurds near Khoi the other day, gave me some hope that the Russians were really resolved to restore order before the Persian troops arrived. I' have since been informed that the Russian patrols in Western Azerbaijan, far from smiting the Kurds whom they find prowling about, shake hands with them, enquire why they are not in their villages, and remind them that it is forbidden to do this and that. They then pass on. Now the Persian commander has informed me, on the authority of the Russian general, that an emissary has been sent to treat with the Shekak minority which caused the trouble near Khoi and that they regard the clash as an accident whidh would not have occurred had they been able to talk with the Kurds beforehand. Moreover, according to the Persian commander, the general has “ advised ” him not to try to disarm any Kurds. I must therefore revert to my original idea that the Russians will do their utmost to avoid hostilities with any Kurds, and that the policy of tenderness will continue. Is not the solution for this impasse to be sought on the Russian front ? If the Russians are successful there, they will not, I feel sure, continue their present policy, which must be unsatisfactory for their political officers and distasteful to their soldiers. If this interpretation is correct, we cannot but feel sympathy with them in their concern, even if their policy of nursing the Kurds seems hardly worth while to us. I do not know what the prospects may be of persuading them to revise their policv here, but I judge that it would be difficult and perhaps hardly worth while. The issue will be decided on the Russian front before many months. _ . D I have, &amp;e. R. W. URQUHART. 7H/J U rio.y(20418) Wt.42601/P.281 3,000 1/42 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd.

Consul-General, Tabriz, give a full account of the rfecent trouble in the Rezaieh district of Azerbaijan. The Persian War Minister reports on his interview with the Russian G.O.C. Azerbaijan and his'journey from Tabriz to Rezaieh. He describes the crowds of refugees on the roads and the lootihg of the abandoned villages, and gives an account of his efforts to persuade the Russians to assist in restoring order and their final agreement to co-operate. Mr. Urquhar^s despatch gives details of the events leading up to the War Minister’s visit. There is some divergence of opinion as to the causes at the root Of/of this disturbance. HJtl. Ambassador and the Consul-General both consider that the inefficiency of the local Persian administration, together with the Kurds’ natural instinct for plunder, were enough to account-for it. The Persians believed that the Kurds* confidence that the Russians would not .oppose them was at the root of Kl acGor* of- Q XlUty ” ' 1 trouble. The Russians, on the other har^ioasofto .appeared to think that the disturbance was due to the hereditary enmity between the Kurds and the local population,and were anxious to minimise the affair in order to avoid becoming involved in hostilities with the Kurds. Finally, the Turks were apprehensive of Kurdish nationalism and stressed the propaganda value of the affair to the enemy. All - even the Persian War* Minister - are agreed in blaming the inefficiency and repae^ity of the local officials. V . * For information. Ou*. ■Pa&amp;it' ^ *1^1. CS lu twfc ^ ^ thtASL be.

This report lias been obtained from Most Secret sources. 2. As you will see, G-eneral Jehanbani gives as his opinion- that the cause of the disorders v/as first, the action of the Gendarmerie at Gezaieh involving the death of three Kurds,!a~«t jccc-M the fact that the Kurds were confident that the riussians would not oppose them. 3. There is a good deal of evidence to show that the Russian^ authorities in Azerbaijan did not realize in time how serious the situation was, but as you are av/are from ir$r tele grams, they have now started to co-operate with the fersian C-ovemment both by allowing 1,500 Persian troops tp be station ed in the district and by posting Russian troops there themselves with instructions to prevent disorder. The investigations of the Minister of War and the course of events themselves seem to show that the Russians were not in any way directly responsible for the disorders and I do not think that any tiling more than the long inherited desire of the Kurds for loot and plunder and the spineless inefficiency and tactlessness of the local authorities is necessary to explain their origin. The continuation of such disorders which are liable to set Itorkey, Russia, Persia and ourselves by the ears, is obviously in the Axis interest, but I can only say that no evidence whatever of direct txis inspiration is at present available. If ^xis agents were in any way re sponsible, they have, I think, acted from the Turkish and not the Persian side of the frontier. 4. Naturally it is a delicate matter for us tc intervene directly in a question of internal security, in the Russian zone. I have, however, done everything possible to induce the Prime Minister to tackle the problem efficiently. I have also endeavour ed to persuade the Soviet Ambassador of tie danger of further disorders, of the necessity of enabling the 1 ersian Government to maintain order, and of the great desirability of reassuring the Turkish Ambassador; and finally I have done what I can to reassure the Turkish Ambassador myself by communicating to him all the information available which would show that the disorderly elements were being held in check and that the trouble was spontaneous and not of some Machiavellian origin and intent. I hope that with the despatch of Persian troops and the stationing of Russian troops in the Area, the situation may speedily improve. 5.

Folld)wins is the text of the Iranian V/ar Minister's report to the Prime Minister on his visit to Rezaieh and on the recent events there:- 1* I submit my report below on my ooumey to Azerbaijan, the recent events at Fezaieh, and the cmisos and results of the Kurdish rebellion and plundering, my observations on the un desirable situation there, and also on the steps taken to assure temporary security and finally the measures that must be taken without loss of time to establish security definitely and for rrevention of probably even worse incidents, 2, On 4th Pay, accompanied by Dr# far zb an, the new tlstandar of Hezaieh, and some officers, I left Tehran, V r e stopped the nipht at razvin, and reached Tabriz the next evening at 10 p#m., after a short stay at 2enjan. The same evening I started pre liminary invoxStigationo with Aghai Pahimi (Ustandar of Tabriz), Dr# Maraban, and Colonel Hashemi, Chief of the Gendarmerie of Azerbaijan, As a consequence, it was evident that the fundamental cause of these events was, finally, the action of the Amnieh in placing their posts round Rezaieh and the killing of three Kurds by the A nieh, and secondly, the confidence of the ’hards that the Russians would not oppose them. 3, It was therefore decided that discussions should first be opened with General Melnikoff, General Officer Cotamanding the Russian forces in Azerbaijan, who resides at Tabriz, and some how solve the matter with him in a friendly manner. On 6th May the General and a number of his senior officers were invited to lunch efc the Ustandari# Discussion began after lunch and con tinued until 6 p#m# The General stated that firstly the decent events were, in general, due to the animosity and strife of the population among themselves, the ancient enmity of the Kurds for them, and recent actions by the Gendarmerie, and that some of the plundering has been done by the people themselves, Secondly, it was mentioned to the General that the insecurity and ruin of villages and dispersal of the villagers has been due to the spoiling of supplies and the appearance of famine, and that this would affect not only the internal situation, but also the Russian forces, so why had no help in solving the trouble been rendered by the Russian authorities in response to repeated requests of the Chief of Gendarmerie and the Ustandar? 4# The General made excuse: ” ince the affair concerns the in ternal affairs of Iran and ¥^e never interfere in your current internal work, thero^re intervention In this matter would, be contrary to a general principle, which the Russian Commander has adopted from the beginning#' It was mentioned to the General: 'You did not agree to our having sufficient forces in the 4th Us tan and secondly the Funds, in the confidence of your help, dafced to commit such dastardly acts#' Further, the General said tfc that serious news received from Rezaieh and the surrounding district was due to the instigation of Fascists and was to their profit and not one per cent of it was true# 5# After this discussion and our hearing this sort of subject it was decided to abandon flying to Rezaieh, but to go there with Colonel Selivanon, Second-in-Co , mand df the Russian forces, who was recently promoted Brigadier, and some other officers,5 and / ^ nve6 ' ,G isa , t® the affair on the spot; to learn in company with hits whether, as tlie Russians thought, the serious news \7as fabricated, or whether some was exaggerated and the rest true. 7 6. On the evening of the same day, the General invited myself and the Us tender, and the officers accoirrpanyitng to the Russian olub, and in the course of the cordial reception given, further discussion took plawe about the necessity for cooperation, and it was definitely decided that v/e should go the next morning, ’hursday, 7th ay, with Colonel Celivanon, three senior Russian officers, and the Ustandar to Rezaieh* s was gathered during the iirst discussion, the political actions of the Government had resulted in unimportant and undesirable effects, and my action also in the affair, in carrying out the rolicy and in order to profit by effective results, should be to continue the Government’s policy. 7. At 7 a.m. on . ay 7th, I left Tabriz with the rcrsons named i.or Rezaieh. Chile passing iarand and Khoi, we saw signs of fear and ( anxiety among the inhabitants. Between Ehoi and Shapufc moat of the villages were about to be evacuated, and large crowds with women, children, cows and sheep, were moving from every quarter towards Khoi and Shapur. On arrival at Shahpur, about 10,000 men and women, some of whom had been plundered and others had been iTightened and fled, were collected in the streets, so that we had the greatest difficulty in getting through the press to the Governor’s office. The crowds pushed after us with shouts and cries to the Governor’s i)lace. The condition of the population was so pitiable that the Russians themselves were affected and anxious for them. 8* I at once took steps to Quieten the people. As telegrams and rex^orts of a Kurdish attack were received from every quarter, mobile patrols of Gendarmerie and Russian soldiers were despatched to places which were being attacked or in danger, .his action gave the people more hope in the Government’s att ntion and leadership for their rescue, and they took our arrival as heaven-sent. 9. After this urgent action to stop further plundering by the ' urde and to quieten the people, we'left at 2 o.m. from Hhahuur towards Rezaieh. 10. On the way, as the Russian officers accomoanying us saw with their own eyes, most of the villages inhabited by j’ersians were evacuated and had been plundered, but some rmenian and Assyrian villages were safe fro® the ravages of the Kurds and their in- naoitants were ousy at cultivation in complete Deace and security* Along the road several groups of refugee villagers besought us and complained of the killing and plundering by the Kurds. 11. After crossing the hushche pass and descending to the plain of luraai, Baradoost and ITa louchai district, which includes the most populated and settled part of ^ezaieh and, on account of having hML* important rivers such as Marlouchai, Kouzechai, Shahrehai and their tributaries, all that land is fertile and rich and has gardens with one to three thousand Persian inhabitants, all that part was entirely without inhabitants; doors and windows had been tinned out, and even the roof-beams of most of the houses had been're moved and taken away. 12. It happened that after our crossing iarlouchai, we net in the plain a group of Kurds, foot and horsemen, numbering about 200. They were scattered and moving in groups, all armed. Kven after the appearance of the first car a number of Kurds (those on foot) ran to the heights, while come of theifc cavalry dismounted and took aim in ditches and channels behind rocks, v/e then reached some of the horsemen, who had with them some timber from doors/' - 3 - and beams and some glass panes and other things from their latest loot of uninhabited villages* The cars stopped at once. With Colonel lelivanov and other Trussian officers we shouted and threatened the horsemen, who were preparing to stand or to run away, to come forward* 13* By means of Hftlld Khan of Tabriz, who was with us, and one of the Russian officers who knew Turki, we questioned them and it appeared that theywsre taking their loot from the ourroundlng villages* ‘Then Colonel Selivanov objected to the head of the Kurds and threatened him that if plundering were repeated the Red Army would begin operations against the 'urds, the headman expressed obedience and promised from the morrow to refrain from plundering* The gear they ’?ere taking away with them they threw on the ground and went off to their own places* . Mle we were busy talking rith this group of Turds and tanking investig ations, other 'urdiah groups, horse and foot, were watching from various distances. lien we left there, they also left tower ’s their villages* Persian villages on the road such as Cave Inn, larghalou, Ohoonqaralon, etc* to the vicinity of Rezaieh town were all empty of inhabitants and rdined* 14* Seeing this pitiful landscape, where a fearful calm reigned from end to end showed that once again those same bl&amp;odstained rebels and evil persons, who have not sr'ailed? the slightest civil isation and humanity, were coming like’ eighteen years ago to welcome us, wdlth this difference only, that then we faced them like enemies bravely in the combat area, while today they came before us with the plundered goods of women and unfortunate people* Ve a t lso with empty hands had to be ashamed towards them, an^ seeing these unfortunate and dark days, in sorrow of heart, but in expectation of the day of vengeance, to leave them as they were and go* The anger and sorrow of our group was such that most of the soldiers with us waited for orders with furious looks to fight against a much more numerous enemy and sacrifice themselves to rescue their fellow countrymen. 15. t 9 p*m. on the sane day v/e reached Rezaieh* At once we made enquiries from Uajer Kamal. the Officer Commanding the Gendarmerie of Rezaieh,and the state of affairs was such that the Chief of the Gendarmerie of the 2nd District of Azerbaijan had made hie report, a summary of which is submitted herewith *) Sin- quiries of the Governor and of the Chief of lolice of Rezaieh confirmed the Gendarmerie report. ! TaWv 16. On Friday, 8th May, at sunrise, thousands of people collected round the Ustandar f 8 Office and some of them entered the yard* Aith groans they complained of the excesses, the plundering, and the raping by the Kurds. ince from tliis point there should be no action without consent of the Russians, the Russian Consul and Colonel Selivanov and othere were asked to come to the Ustandar’s office. !\fter detailed discussions as to prevention of killing and plundering by the Kurds and to re-establish security, it was agreed that for the present there should be posts of Russians and Gendarmerie in essential places, subject to Kurdish excesses and plundering. Accordingly it was also agreed to prepare a notice to comfort the refugees and plundered villagers, and in order to give them hope in speedy action by the Government, I read it to the crowd and each sentence was repeated in Turki to the people* 17. That evening we were invited by the Russian Commander, with the Ustandars and officers accompanying, to the Russian Club, and In the course of the cor&amp;iep. reception given us again friendly discussion took place regarding the necessary co-operation. 18. A copy of this notice will be attached for your attention. Then by means of Ghazi Mohamad and 3ayid Abdulla, who are both influential priests among the Kurds, advice, threats, and en couragement were given; but considering the present serious situation / j4 situation, there is no hope of success hy this method* Also 67 villagers and Aendarmerie, who were wounded and branded in the recent events, are seriously ill in the Govemment hospital and were shown to Colonel Sellvanon* Casualties, including those died from wounds or by drowning, about 400, according to the [villagers’ reports. 19. On the afternoon of the 9th i ay, as arranged, a start was made in annointing and placing the posts in the necessary points. T n order that, until despatch of a force from Tehran and its arrival at Rezaleh, full advantage should be taken of the favouiv able attitude of the Russians after their having seen the situation, it was arranged that the posts should be manned at once, and after arrival of the force, these posts would consist only of Iranian troops, The secret purpose of this temporary^ arrangement was to make the Russians partly responsible for the insecurity in the region, the serious outcome of which has been as related, so that in future they would be mo-e concerned in it. 20, On 10th May, hen we left Rezaieh, as we observed en route, all posts necessary had been established, and to some extent people were hopeful from these measures and the return of security. 21. In Shahpur also General Pelivanon again definitely instructed the Thissian Commander to co-operate with the Gendarmerie in the prevention of plundering an' again made the people hopeful from the prompt measures taken by the Government to re-establish security. \lso~ after our return to Tabriz on the lith May, there was another interview with the General Officer Conrasanding-in-Chiaf the Russian forces, and in the course of friendly discussion he practically confessed their mistake with regard to the Kurds and their not understanding the damage of these events and gave a definite promise of help and co-operation. 22. But with regard to the damage sustained by this region, since the Detail of Rezaieh is the most populated and richest part of Azerbaijan and has countless flocks and herds, the total damage is very great and has been estimated at 70 million rials, mostly sheep and animals. Conclusion. ..HI K*l»WII* - HIWWIWII^* 23. Having regard to the importance of this district from the view point of different policies prevailing there and other probable dangers which may reach there, the most important thing in this district is the se? ection of officials who do their work properly, with intelligence and interest in the security and peace of the population* Because most of these undesirable events are evidently the result of the ignorance of officials as to the political position* and the rapacity and oppression. -econd in importance is the despatch of a sufficient force, so that with restoration of confidence and agreement of the Russians, by treating the population kindly and attracting the tribal chiefs, they may carry out their difficult and onerous 'mission. The tribes who have practised this kind of treason and have injured and plundered the people should be severely punished. If today this measure is not appropriate or effective, tom# 3 rrow they should act in a more severe way. If other methods of action are considered, this depends upon the {Government’s view. *) Hot attachedX THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

Consul-General Urquhart to Sir R. Bullard. &lt;yr ^ . 3f . 'o • 'tri - C . /. RECd. P (No. 13. Confidential.) gj r Tabriz, May 7, 1942. I HAVE the honour to submit the following report in amplification of my recent telegrams on the troubled state of Western Azerbaijan. 2. It is now accepted that the Kurdish bullet which killed the American, Mrs. Burdett, on the road from Mehabad to Tabriz was intended not for her but for a young Kurd who was accompanying her. Her death is therefore no more than a tragic incident in a Kurdish blood-feud. Her murderers were arrested. 3. From Rezaieh on the 28th April there came news of seemingly very serious import. The Kurds were advancing in strength on the town. During most of the 27th there had been heavy rifle-fire, which sent the people from the surrounding villages panic-stricken into the town, carrying and driving befoie them what they could of their portable possessions and flocks. Presently the town was surrounded, even the 12-mile road to the lake being cut, so that there was no communication except by telegraph. These conditions persisted for seven or eight days, when there came a relaxation in the tension. At the moment the Kurds seem to have withdrawn a little from the town, but both Rezaieh and Salmas are stated to be full of refugee villagers, who will certainly have lost some part of their possessions, to say nothing of their time, at a season when time is indeed money, even in Persia. 4. The Persian Government has been poorly represented and badly served during this crisis. There has been no Governor-General there since General Cupal left °Buzurg Amir Ibrahimi, recently appointed Governor, was acting as Governor-General, but he seems to have left at the first signs of trouble and is thought now to be under arrest. At all events, Mr. Fahimy here was given temporary charge of Western Azerbaijan as from the 28th, but could not bring himself to proceed. He contented himself with persuading two Kuidish notables of Mehabad, Ghazi Mohammed and Sheikh Abdullah, to go to Rezaidh and try to persuade the Kurds to disperse. They were both there by the 30tJh and claimed an initial success, which cheered Mr. Fahimy greatly. Then their stock fell; it seemed that the Russians were jealous of their activity, if the Persians were to be believed, and it is certain that the officials already on the spot were aggrieved because these men arrived without warning and proceeded on mystei ions missions without consulting them. But the most effective opposition to the Ghazis was made by an Assyrian who removed parts from their car so that for some days they sat in Rezaieh complaining by telegraph that the Russians would not give them transport. By the 3rd or the 4th May they had obtained some sort of transport and were moving around the encampments again, but by this time all hopes had been transferred to the possibility that someone would come from —f-3e—2i] ^T. ■ )5JUN 942 INDIA OFFICE2 Tehran and take charge of the situation. Meantime the petty officials left in Rezaieh sent telegram after telegram pleading their danger and helplessness, blaming the Russians for helping the Kurds and demanding instructions. 5. The Russians, it is said, could have stopped the trouble at an hour’s notice by merely telling the Kurds to go home. Why, therefore, it is demanded—, did they not expend the small amount of energy necessary to put an end to ti turmoil? The answer comes&amp;&amp;too easily that the Russians are planning to km the authority of the Persian Government here in the north. The Russians certainly seem to have done very little to support the gendarmes and comfort the peaceful population. The Soviet Consul-General and the Chief of Staff certainly flew to Rezaieh on the 30th and met a body of Kurdish leaders the same evening. They appealed to them to disperse and supported the chief of police in his explanation that there was no intention to disarm the Kurds generally, but merely to prevent them carrying arms into the town; but the net result was that the Kurds presented demands (see Appendix) some of which seem to be hardly the sort of thing a Kurd wmuld think of readily. I had many talks with my Soviet colleague after his return, but I found it difficult to get more out of him than variations of the themes that there had been great exaggeration, that the local authority was incredibly inefficient and also lacking in goodwill to end, by making reasonable concessions, a commotion which they themselves had started. I tried to persuade him that the inefficiency of the average Persian official is a permanent factor in this country, that exaggeration and panic are normal, but that a state of affairs existed which was sufficiently alarming to require some controlling action. I told him that obviously there must be suffering in the villages in view of the pillaging of such property as the villagers had been unable to carry with them, and that possibly crops would be lost to an extent which might threaten a shortage of food. I repeated some of the things our Turkish colleague had feared, suggesting that, even if he, too, were exaggerating a good deal, German propa- o-aiida was bound to make use of these events and all the attendant rumours for purposes of propaganda in Turkey, and particularly propaganda addressed to military circles there. During one conversation he placed the number of Kurds under arms at 10,000, and was obviously worried by the mere idea of a punitive expedition by the Russians against such numbers. I think he was genuinely concerned lest the Soviet authorities should drift into hostilities with the Kurds. The military authorities probably do not care to rely on the theory that they have but to say the word to see the Kurdish forces melt away; they would probably not care to risk a fiasco, and to be sure of enforcing an order to disperse they probably would like to have certain forces at their disposal. It seems unlikely that a request for permission to divert such forces for possible hostile operations against the Kurds would be welcomed at headquarters, or that any local official here would sponsor it if he could avoid doing so. I have therefore wondered these days whether Kuibyshev knew what was happening, whether the local officials were' trying to minimise the commotion and hoping that it would solve itself with no more than the loss of lives here and there and the pillage of some villages. . , . , , 6. My Turkish colleague was no doubt right m stressing the propaganda value for the enemy in the events of the past ten days. His interest in what is happening on the Iffirkish frontier is natural and I expect there is some ground for his view that there are elements among the Kurds who thirst for revenge on Turkey and who are only awaiting a favourable moment in order to make trouble on the Turkish side of the frontier. I think, too, that he was justified in noting any signs of Russian consideration and tenderness for the Kurds as against the Persians and in scrutinising closely those of the Kurdish demands which contained indications that some Kurds are thinking, of a Kurdish national life and the perpetuation of a separate Kurdish organisation within the State, in direct opposition to the policy of both Turkey and Persia towards such minorities. But his talk opes far beyond such considerations and he sees in the Rezaieh disorders the beofinnino- of religions massacres and the possibility that Turkey may have to intervene again. He has made much of a demand made by a delegation of Rezaietes that 'the frontier be thrown open so that the peaceful people of Western Azerbaijan may flee to the protection of their brother Turks. He took this piece of oriental exaggeration more or less seriously, but the Turkish Vice-Consul at Rezaieh was wiser; he asked the persons who made a corresponding request to him to put it in writing, and that was the end of the matter. The fact is that3 the Turkish Consul-General here is dehnitely persuaded that the Germans will succeed in breaking up the Russian defence and that there will be serious disorder in these parts before the Germans can take control. 7. As Mr. Cook indicated in his despatch No. 11 of the 23rd April, the new Qpa^sul of the United States of America has more or less publicly declared himsell h oe a watchdog against possible Russian aggression. He told me on the 28th April that he had found the Soviet Chief of Staff and the consul-general together at the Soviet Consulate-General and that they had asked him whether or not they should intervene and that when he left them they had determined not to do so. At the time I thought it possible that at some stage the same question might be put to me and accordingly I enquired by telegram whether you agreed that the Russians should be encouraged to support the gendarmes. The question was never put, however, and I now think that the American Consul was consulted not because there was any intention to take his advice, but to see into his mind. It may do the Russians no harm to know that the United States Consul is convinced that they have ulterior motives. 8. After consideration of all the facts, distorted as they are by rumour and fear, and having heard what my colleagues have to say, I am sure that the Russians are justified in saying that it is the Persians themselves who have touched off this explosion. No doubt the explosive were already there; the Kurds were bound sooner to start shooting after so many years of restraint. But the weakness of the Government's team at Rezaieh, the speed with which Governors- General have left compared with their reluctance to arrive and the nervousness of the “ A jams ” in general were an invitation to an ebullition of the Kurdish warlike spirit. It was Sefihang Hashimi’s visit to Rezaieh which brought matters to a head. An order was issued that Kurds must not carry arms into the town, and Serhang Hashimi told his gendarmes to see that it was enforced. A number of incidents followed in which the Kurds considered that they were attacked by the Persians as part of a scheme to restore tyrannical control. A son of Sheikh Taha, riding in Rezaieh in a carriage with his rifle in his hand, was dragged down and beaten. A Kurd wearing a turban had his face slapped. Two sons and three servants of Hadji Agha, carrying rifles in or near the town, were attacked by gendarmes and wiped out. The Kurds knew that the Persians lacked the force to back up this attitude; they apparently counted on a free hand from the Russians, and so the trouble started. 9. Now at last a representative of standing has been sent from Tehran. The Minister for War reached Rezaieh to-night, and with him were the new Governor-General for Western Azerbaijan, Dr. Marzeban, the Governor-General for Eastern Azerbaijan and the Soviet Chief of Staff from Tabriz. The Minister received the Consular Corps on the afternoon of the 6th while still at Tabiiz. He said that he had practically secured Russian co-operation and that he expected to be able to send a division of Persian troops to be stationed at Ardebil, Tabriz and Rezaieh. He hoped that Persian troops from the south and from the east would converge on Rezaieh and crush the Kurds, but at the same time he said the present was not the moment for a final settlement. As regards the vexed question of carrying arms, he said he contemplated for the time being some arrangement such as obtains in Iraq, where licences are issued freely to enable Kurds to carry weapons and to be within the law. To-day it is said that the Pi ime Minister has telegraphed to him urging him not to be too lenient with the Kinds, and foi the moment Persian confidence is climbing steeply out of the abyss where it was plunged for the past ten days. It will indeed be interesting to observe what will become of the Kurdish demands, how far the Russians may assist, or at least permit, the Persians to restore their authority, and Whether the Persians will show wisdom and restraint if they do get the upper hand. 10. It should be stated that, whereas the Soviet Consul-General alleged that the Kurds of the north-west had been assisted by others from the south and from the Iraqi frontier, information so far obtained from the Persians themselves and from a Kurd living in Mehabad is definite that no tribes were involved except those living in the area along the frontier west of the lake. Salmas was not involved. The total number of rifles may be put at 1,000. or 1,500 at the most, according to the Persians. . . . . , A • u a 11 It was rumoured from time to time that Assyrians and Armenians had ioined the rebel Kurds, and no doubt there were individuals from the minorities who were ready to loot and wipe off old scores. In general, however, there seems4 to be no question of fighting for religion alone, and it now seems likely that the total death-roll will not correspond with the panic. There has been nothing in the nature of a massacre and the talk of atrocities has no doubt been exaggerated. At present the list stands at seven women with breasts cut off. some girls raped and some children thrown into a stream. The Soviet Consul-General has assured me that the newly appointed Russian Consul at Rezaieh went with the chief'-*'*' police‘to investigate one atrocity report and found it to be quite untrue. I have, &amp;c. R. W. URQUHART. Appendix. CONDITIONS laid down by Kurdish leaders at a meeting with Persian and Russian representatives on the 30th April, 1942 :— 1.

A new journal, called Talk and Action, has appeared m labriz, edited by one Akhbari of the Education Department, who was suspected of pro-Nazi sympathies not so long ago. The first harmless number contained an ai tic e calling for national unity and co-operation, and another demanding the loreibie tearing-oft of women s-veils by the police, as under the former regime.^ lo t e general surprise the Soviet-sponsored newspaper in Turkish, \ atan Yolanda, is now to be restricted to the Red Army, and copies will not be available for the local public; only a few months ago its circulation in Persian schools, factories and offices was being boosted by Soviet political officers in uniform, but the ntc. major-general here has other ideas, or has perhaps received other instructions. The paper's recent article on German activities on both sides of the lurkish frontier may also have something to do with its sudden restriction. On the other band an anonymous broadsheet in Turki dialect attacking the local authonties and their alleged Fascist policy has been widely distributed this last week here and in other parts of Azerbaijan. , , ^ , 5 News from the Kurdish area is that the rebel Rashid Khan, after another clash with the Persian military, is now in Sahab. and has declined peace proposals made by Amir Asad, the Kurdish farmandar of Sauj Bulagh. 1 he proposals are said to have included the promise of a post as bakhshidar at Baneh, but Rashid Khan evidently does not trust the Persian authorities, and remembering past treatment of chiefs who had trustfully submitted has perhaps good reason for not doine so. The Kurdish notables Ghazi Mohamed and Sheikh Abdulla are still in Tabriz, and the local authorities have the idea of giving them a small sinecure or some form of monthly subsidy, the appointment of a commission in Tehran several weeks ago to examine tribal questions has only just been heard of here and has caused no particular comment or reaction. Even m ttie Governor-General’s view, the new policy does not concern Azerbaijan tribes either Kurdish Shahsevan or Karadaghi, being intended for tribes m the south who were more aggrieved by the former Shah’s repressions and exactions. 6 Some of the self-exiled Tabrizi upper-class are reported to be returnmo- here from Tehran, partly because of the dearness of living and shortage of good bread there, and partly because of the alleged outbreak of typhus m the capita . This outbreak is blamed by everyone on the influx of I olish refugees, whom the British and Russians have introduced into this country. 1 here are several cases of tvphus reported also in Tabriz, and some people are already staying away from cinemas and other public places. The Soviet military authorities have otlereo their_assista p aV e also agreed to lend transport f°r the moving of 400 tons of wheat from Bustanabad to the Government silo at labuz. e latter now contains about 4,500 tons of grain, and has earmarked another 1 300 tons of wheat at Ushnu and smaller quantities at Maragha and Miandoab, none of which can be collected, however, for lack ot transport. Tribesmen at oresent refuse to hire camels, which are at spring pasture. 8 There has been a good deal of Russian troop movement here lately, five train loads of cavalry having arrived in one day. Some of this is due to ordinary changes in garrisons and personnel, but there has undoubtedly been an addi ion to the previous numbers of troops in North-West Persia. It is difficult to get exact information as the Russians are so secretive on the one hand, and the Persians i Xzerbaiianis so childishly mendacious and fond of exaggeration on the ot^ei. buf increases have apparent^ taken place along the Turkish frontier, where the Soviet mditary have agreed to let local gendarmerie work with them m policing Soviet military nave alleo . ed smi io-glers, it is explained), and appreciable nl^r^ount^ by D |&gt;me Tabriz,! at four regiments have numbers ot moumea ^ latter movements, of course, caused full S on f tow f^|^ o a r am K to the recent German broadcasts, which stated that thf^^rftish^vOT^^Hthdr^i’tS^l* 0 ® 0 ^ 1 r ^ a aI ' d allowi ^ the f0rCeS „ t0 occupy' Humadan and Kermanshah to begin with, and to move as far as the Persian Gulf later.9 A United States Consul, Mr. B.

Tabriz, together with Chancery letter of the 14th April 1942. from His Majesty’s Consul/Tabriz, regarding the internal situation of Tabriz and Azerbaijan. Tehran, Ayril 20, 1942. Enclosure 1. Consul Cook to Sir R. Bullard. (No. 10. Confidential.) gi r Tabriz, April 8. 1942. I HAVE the honour to inform you that the situation in Tabriz and Azerbaijan generally is now quiet, and is probably closer to normal than at any time since August last. 2. Robberies and thefts have almost ceased in Tabriz itself, and the “ democratic ” committees are gradually breaking up and losing the disquieting effect they had on the general population only a month or two ago. The police have displayed an extraordinary leniency towards the leaders, once that they knew they could deal with them without difficulty, and have allowed several of the noisiest firebrands to go into hiding. The official explanation is that the authorities did not wish to incur a charge of being as harsh and repressive as during the former detested regime and so afford material for further attacks on the Tehran Government. This would accord with the easy-going and would-be diplomatic personality of the Governor-General, M. Khalil Fahimy, but he tells me confidentially that he is not satisfied with the laxness and poor efficiency of the local police and of its chief in this connexion. It is a fact that, after the police had watched all night tq arrest one Pouladoff. in the morning he was spirited off by four unknown civilians under their eyes and lost to them. I suspect that the local authorities are still nervous of the susceptibilities of the Russians, whom they still credit with being behind these “ clubs ” in spite of all disclaimers; it is also practically certain that some of the leading committee-men were police agents, so' that it might be awkward to arrest them.. At any rate this episode is nearly over, although we shall doubtless hear more of the “ democrats ” later in some guise or other. 3. The newspaper Azerbaijan overstepped itself last week in its usual anti-Government tirades by printing an article accusing the local authorities of sending large quantities of wheat from Bustanabad (near Tabriz) to Tehran while there was only forty days’ supply left here, so that in a few weeks Azerbaijan would be 'without bread. As a result the whole ignorant population of Tabriz rushed to the bakeries and each tried to lay in as big a stock of bread as they could buy. The Governor-General acted quickly by publishing a notice saying that the report was completely baseless, that no wheat was being moved from Bustanabad except to Tabriz—very gradually because of lack of transport— and that anyone who wished could go and inspect the stocks of over 5.000 tons of wheat in the silos here. He then turned the tables on the editor by saying that spreading panic by such means was a crime, and that it might be remembered that just recently Berlin and Rome had been broadcasting false reports of food shortages in Azerbaijan so that readers could draw their own inferences as to the editor’s sources and intentions. As the editor and sub-editor are bosom [29—49] RECd. POL, DEPt. 6JUN 942 INDIA OFFICE2 — - friends of the Soviet political officers here, this may be considered a heaven-sent opportunity for the local authorities to deal with their most troublesome detractors; they immediately closed the press, seized the next issue and have bound the editor over as regards his future behaviour. 4. r £he truculent-looking and unpopular Kurds who have been loafing about for some time in Tabriz (largely in the hope of buying sugar and cotton-goodjggi wholesale from the Russians) have also played into the hands of the authorities recently, and are being forced back to their own districts. Ten days ago there was a shooting affray between a Kurd and an Azerbaijani, both being smugglers and both being killed. The other Kurds in the town rushed to the spot and began excited threatenings (all being armed, of course), some rushing into the police stations in quest of Kurds wrongly alleged to have been arrested, fortunately no further incidents occurred, but the authorities decided to try and remove the menace. The Soviet Consul-General agreed that the Kurds ought to leave, and I spoke to two Kurdish notables in that sense. The Governor-General distributed a quantity of sugar to the leading Kurds, and most have now gone away. At the same time he published a notice saying that all persons carrying arms in public would be disarmed by the police, and most Kurds took the hint, only a very few having had to be disarmed in the street. 5. All these measures could have been taken several weeks ago, but the authorities are still inefficient, and. as I wrote in my preceding despatch, possibly did not wish to see public order fully restored, so that they could continue to press for the return of Persian troops here. It is now known that the Soviet authorities have agreed to the sending of a military garrison up to a brigade to Tabriz, and to the increase of the gendarmerie forces in Rezaieh. There is no sign of these military forces as yet in Tabriz, but about 300 well-armed gendarmerie have already arrived here from Tehran for Rezaieh. The Governor-General tells me that the Soviet authorities have agreed to let their troops on the Turkish frontier work in close co-operation when necessary with these new gendarmerie forces, so as to check the smuggling and illicit crossings alleged to be going on there. 6. A month ago I mentioned that the Kurdish chieftain Amir Asad had gone to Tehran by official invitation. Ten days ago, to the surprise of the Governor-General and many others, he returned here as newly-appointed Farmandar of Mahabad (Sauj Bulagh), with a motor-car. new clothes and a considerable sum of Government money to set him up in his new post. He told me that he had not wished to accept the appointment, but that the Minister of the Interior had insisted, and had given him authority to maintain 300 mounted Kurdish levies to preserve order in the whole district, as far as the Iraq borders. In principle the appointment of a Kurd as Governor of a Kurdish district may be applauded, but whether the present nomination will be a success remains to be seen. Amir Asad is an intelligent and ambitious little man. but with no polish or training and, it need hardly be said, with many jealous Kurdish rivals among the other tribes over which he is now placed in addition to his own. He will have to appease many of them with minor posts and suitable emoluments, which will go hard against the grain. The chief notable of Sauj Bulagh, Ghazi Mohamed, has already left the town and is probably going to Tehran, doubtless to intrigue against him. There is another allegedly influential Kurd in this district, one Sheikh Abdulla, a chieftain reported to have been living at Batas in Iraq in exile for some time, who has recently crossed into Persia again and is said to have been consulting with all the leading Kurds in the Rezaieh and Sauj Bulagh areas. The story is that he has been using his prestige to persuade the chieftains to cease quarrelling at this critical juncture and join together in spiritual harmony, although I have heard nothing of any political tinge being given to this, or any talk of Kurdish independence, which most chieftains now regard as impracticable. The Russians seem to be curious about him and his activities and, as I have heard from a good source, have warned him to be gone. 7. There is little news of the rebel Rashid Khan, except that he has been bombed out of Saqqiz and was said to be inclined towards peace. Amir Asad informed me that he himself intended to try and fix up some agreement between the rebel and the Government forces, and that General Shahbakhti in Tehran had authorised him to do so. I was surprised when he asked earnestly if I also authorised him to try and settle the Kurdish revolt, and whether he' could tell Rashid Khan that I was in favour of a truce. But only a few days before the Governor-General had also asked my views equally earnestly on his own desire to get in touch with the rebel and make peace, at the alleged instance of M. Soheily3 himself. It can only be concluded that certain official circles here as in Tehran are still of the opinion, or at least not wholly unconvinced, that we are or were behind or connected with the troubles in Kurdistan, as was generally alleged last autumn. 8. The post of Governor of Rezaieh has recently been filled bv the transfer the second-rate, timid and unpopular Buzurg Khan from Monabad, which - allows a slipshod policy on the part of the Tehran Government, who apparently do not even consult the Governor-General here beforehand. The latter says that an equally poor choice has been made at Ardebil. and that at Maragha the new Farmandar was such an egregious failure that he had to have him quickl) removed. At the present juncture Azerbaijan needs the best possible officials to hold up the shaky prestige of the Central Government, not mere routine transfers of known misfits or nominees of friends of Ministers in Tehran. 9. I have already reported how conspicuous by their absence have been the Soviet political officers, who, until about two months ago, infested the countryside. This improvement was due, no doubt, to our representations in Moscow and Tehran, coupled with the arrival of a trained and intelligent Soviet Consul- General here in January. I notice, however, that one of the most persistent, one Miroslanoff, has just returned to Tabriz after his absence somewhere in the Caucasus, and learn that the most objectionable of all, a certain Bagharoff, has been seen again in the Sarab area, where he is said to have expressed himself most angrily to some village headmen about the restoration of normal conditions and the virtual annulment of his previous hard work! I have an idea that the Russians will try again—but very discreetly—to work among the Kurds, whose leaders fear and dislike communism but like intrigue and personal favours. It is almost openly said in places like Maragha that the Russians are using Kurds to go over the mountainous Iraq frontier to work for them in Mosul and other districts now occupied by our forces; this may be true since their military mission left Bagdad. 10. A new general officer, Major-General Melnik, has recently arrived to take command of the Soviet forces in Azerbaijan, which for some months have been commanded by a colonel only. He is a young-looking cavalryman who has seen service at the front. The Soviet authorities have asked the Persians to take steps to see that no supplies leave this district, as they apparently fear shortage in supplying their own troops here. They are also exporting local cattle to the Caucasus, whth the unwilling permission of the Persian officials; the latter prefer sheep to be taken, but the Russians say that these are too poor and lean. 11. The local authorities say that there is enough seed-corn available in Azerbaijan, except in the Khalkhal district near Ardebil, and asked the Soviet trade bureau to sell them 500 tons. The Russians offered to provide the wheat at 1,500 rials per ton (the local price being 1,000 rials), against an equivalent amount of Persian rice to be sold to themselves at 1.200 rials per ton (the local price being at least 3,000 rials), and the business naturally broke down. Mean- ! while the Soviet trade bureau is selling in Tabriz quantities of the sugar recently supplied from India and Java; part is being sold at normal prices through the I co-operative store they are supposed to foster here, and part is sold in the bazaar at “ black-market ” rates. After five months they still decline to pay customs duties on the merchandise imported from the Soviet Union, which means large profits for them in rials. 12. Unemployment and poverty are somewhat less marked in Tabriz, as labour is now needed for the gardens in and near the town, and many villagers who had flocked here during the winter have returned for the spring farm work. The authorities also continue with their road-making works and with assistance to small industries. 13. It is reported that the railway construction from Zinjan has now advanced to the entrance to the Kuflan Kuh gorge, a few miles from Mianeh. The gorge itself will take a long time to pass, wuth its several tunnels and the large bridge necessary over the river there. Unfortunately work is entirely suspended on lots 12 and 13. on the Tabriz side of Mianeh, as the original contractors are short of funds. Work is said to be going on in lot 14. 14. The Turkish Consul at Rezaieh recently set out for Angora via Maku and Erzerum, but had to turn back as the road inside Turkey was blocked by snow and will not be clear until mid-April. This winter has been unusually severe and prolonged, and it still continues to snow at least one day a week in Tabriz. The Turkish Consul-General here went specially to Khoi to discuss with-t his colleague en route to Angora. He has lately been seeing the Soviet Consu General more frequently than usual, and seems to be much more circumspect m his views and utterances than he was before, this may be due to admonitions from his ambassador in Tehran. I have. &amp;c. F. A. G. COOK. ^ Enclosure 2. Consul Cook to Chancery, Tehran. (Confidential.) Dear Chancery, Tabriz, Afril 14, 1942. AS a safe hand is. going to-day, we may add the following interim notes to our last political despatch No. 10 of the 8th instant : The Kurdish stock here has fallen since the apparent switch-round in the Russian attitude towards them. The newspaper article in the Vaten 1 olanda last week, saying that the Iraqi and Persian Kurds were being provided with modern arms by German agents in Turkey in order to stir them up against us in the oil-fields, has made them nervous, especially since the Soviet authorities here have shown themselves in favour of having them disarmed in Tabriz by the despised Persian police, and have declined (it is said) to give them any more sugar and piece-goods except at much enhanced prices. The Governor-General here,, however, says that the Russian commander at Rezaieh is still publicly hand- in-glove with the Kurds and Assyrians there, but we have no means of checking this at present. . The Turkish authorities can hardly be pleased either at the Soviet article above, as it was implied that the Kurds on the Turkish side of the frontier also were being armed for mischief. There is undoubtedly a good deal of va-et-vient over the Turco-Persian frontier, which the Russian troops are unable to cope with—hence perhaps the offered co-operation with increased gendarmerie m that area. A committee of inspectors sent from Tehran to Rezaieh recently apparently had a very thin time proving to the Soviet there that they were not a band of German agents come to stir up the Kurds. Quantities of Japanese silks and artificial silk-stuffs are coming here from the Sauj Bulagh area, almost certainly smuggled out of Iraq, so that there is a lot of unauthorised crossing of that frontier too. Amir Asad, I know, thinks that he may have trouble with Kurds coming over more or less freely from the Iraq side, and asked me whether 1 could have anything done about it in Bagdad and Sulaimaniya. Being now clothed in authority, and doubtless for the moment “ plus royaliste que le Roil his idea is to wean disaffected Kurds away from Rashid Khan gradually, if the latter will not make peace. It is rumoured, however, that Rashid has expressed his intention of coming shortly to Sauj Bulagh to singe Amir Asad’s whiskers for traitorously joining the Tehran side. The “ democratic ” clubs seem to be on their last legs, especially since two of the leaders have at last been arrested—one of them for theft and receiving of stolen goods. The Kurdish sea-lawyer Zandi, abandoned by the Russians, now o-oes round begging from the Persian authorities and even from the Armenian clergy. It is s^id that his newest idea is to band together Kurds and Armenians in a &amp; cultural and political brotherhood, but that bantam will never fight here! Some of the self-exiled Tabriz! upper-class are reported to be returning here from Tehran, partly because of the dearness of living and shortage of bread there, and partly because of the alleged serious outbreak of typhus in the capital. Everyone says—and with great relish, of course—that the dread disease has been brought into Persia by the Poles, whom the British and Russians have introduced into this country. Re measures against pro-Axis sympathisers, I spoke meaningly about a fortnight ago to the Chief of Police 1 here, giving the names of the six worst offenders. He apparently called them up and warned them, and one of them (Ardesh-Haidarzadeh) was so scared that he went to Tehran. The chief cafe keepers also were warned not to allow nonsense to be talked in their establishments, and the anti-Allied talk is certainly not so noticeable as it was a few weeks ago. Yours ever F.

I HAVE the honour to report that the situation in Tabriz has become much calmer during the past fortnight, and the police authorities themselves appear to think that the danger of the political clubs has disappeared or is disappearing for the time being. [ 2. No doubt the Chief of Police is congratulating himself on this result, but in my opinion the improvement in public order is due largely to the Russian authorities having let it be known that they were not supporting the band of nondescript demagogues who were running the clubs or committees, and partly to the character of the demagogues themselves. Their funds are getting low and (as I foretold) they are beginning to quarrel among themselves. The Chief of Police, who was complaining a few weeks ago of their malevolence and of the danger they constituted to the town, now that the Administration is no longer so worried by or afraid of them / talks of the advisability of not taking unnecessarily stern measures against people who are doing no real harm. 3. In this somewhat surprising lenient attitude towards fellow-Persians, who are officially undesirable and at the same time unprotected, he appears to differ temporarily from his widely-hated colleagues in the gendarmerie, who are said on all sides to be perpetrating continual cruelties and excesses on the wretched peasants and villages in districts unfortunate enough to be the scene o¥ their operations. Numbers of these people come miles into Tabriz to bewail their treat ment at the hands of their own authorities, and often finish up at the Soviet Consulate. My Soviet colleague tells me that he knows for an unimpeachable fact, with names and full details, that the eyes of two villagers were recently put out by the gendarmerie—now so full of zeal where they were so abjectly cowardly six months ago. The Soviet political officers seem to have moderated their activities to a remarkable extent during the last few weeks, and certainly they need not spend so much effort as is alleged against them on subverting the'local peasantry while the Persian Government's minions will stir up hatred against itself so much more efficiently. 4. After the departure of the allegedly corrupt and worthless Colonel Basti, who has been openly accused in a Tabriz newspaper of having extorted £7,000 during his tenure of three months in Azerbaijan, a new Chief of Gendarmerie has been appointed in the person of Colonel Rashimi, until recently an army officer, of a well-known local family, reputed to be energetic and to have a thorough knowledge of Azerbaijan. His first task has been to drive out a number of Shahsevan marauders from the Maragha district; they ^are reported to have retreated after some fighting to the neighbourhood of Sain Kala, where they can efface themselves among other Shahsevans who have settled peaceably there as agriculturists.

As he had learnt that the Soviet military authorities at Zenjan were stoppingthe sending out of food-stuffs from their zone to other parts of Persia, he got into touch with the Soviet supplies department here through this consulate with a view to exporting the potatoes for our troops without difficulty, the Kussians, however, refused any facilities, saying that local supplies of food-stufts in general were already running short, and that in a month or two there would be hardly -hough for the needs of the Red Army, which no longer brought supplies from the U.S.S.R. and had to obtain them here m Azerbaijan. I think this attitude somewhat exaggerated, although it is probably true that this province does not normally produce enough potatoes and vegetables for export. With propei encouragement and organisation, however, Azerbaijan could probably provide large quantities for our troops and the Russians as well. Yet local feeling is so unsure of itself, because of what is expected to happen m the next few months, that little extra growing is likelv to be done. Fears are common on the contrary, that the local harvest will be less than usual, and the Governor-General recently refused the request of the Tehran authorities that several thousand tons of wheat should be sent to the capital from the Bustanabad district near Tabriz. His view is that, while some wheat might perhaps be taken from the outlying distnc s of the province near Mianeh, it would be imprudent to remove wheat from so near this large city of Tabriz, where the Government silo is as yet less than hair full, and where scarcity of transport makes the collection of proper local reserves a slow and difficult business.

At the beginning of March there was little improvement in tne situation at Tabriz, but Azerbaijan as a whole was fairly quiet. There had been few outstanding burglaries or robberies in the town, though little respect was paid to the Police. So little did the Persians trust their own administration that H*M. Consul was blamed for leaving everything to them and not himself dealing firmly with the Russians. He himself was inclined to wonder if in fact the Persians wished to establish complete law and order.

(No. 86.) r , HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Tabriz despatch No. 7 of the 9th March to this legation on the subject of the internal situation in Azerbaijan. Tehran, March 17, 1942. 102 Enclosure. Consul Cook to Sir R. Bullard. (No. 7. Confidential.) Sir, Tabriz, March 9, 1942. I HAVE the honour to report that during the last fortnight the disturbed situation in Tabriz has improved very little, while, on the other hand, the province of Azerbaijan is comparatively quiet for the moment. 2. Outstanding robberies and burglaries have been fewer, except for one in the house of an Armenian Turkish subject, where four armed men cowed the occupants and took away about 10,000 rials and some valuable carpets. Luckily, the police arrested two of the men within a week, both described as Armenian refugees from the Caucasus, and found much stolen property from other burglaries in the house of an old woman refugee. Next day a story was spread in the town that, while this woman was being interrogated at the police station, another refugee entered with two Soviet soldiers and demanded her immediate release. On hearing this I went to see my Soviet colleague and urged him to have the matter investigated quickly, as the Persians were sure to make the most of such a story of Russian interference on behalf of the hated “ refugees,” whom the Soviet authorities were continually accused of backing in their misde meanours. So far the alleged Soviet soldiers have not been traced, and the Soviet Consul-General declares that they were probably local individuals masquerading in Soviet uniforms, either to make sure of obtaining their friend’s release or (as he hints) as a provocative act staged by someone interested in arousing anti-Russian feeling. The police say that the woman was not released. 3. The “ proletarian ” clubs and committees still continue to cause nervousness among the general public of Tabriz, although there are signs that their sudden burst of activity is on the wane, partly because of lack of funds and partly because they foresee Persian police action against them soon. It now appears that there is a principal club forming the headquarters of about a dozen noisy demagogues, nearly all of whom have Russian-Azerbaijan names ending in—-off, but under the control of a dubious Kurdish lawyer named Zandi, and then four or five affiliated clubs in various parts of the city. Those enrolling pay 5 rials only, and Persians are quick to point out that the organisation’s expenses cannot be met without funds from other sources—Soviet sources are, of course, implied. It is also alleged that members receive a card which entitles them to extra sugar rations at a co-operative store backed by the Soviet authorities. The truth seems to be that the Soviet authorities did assist the committee’s finances, but by an ingenious method which entailed no expense to themselves; their trade commissioner here supplied the club organisers with sugar at wholesale prices, which they sold to members at the usual retail price, using the profit for club expenses (and personal expenses, no doubt). For some reason the Russians have w lately withdrawn this privilege, and Zandi admits that funds are now too low ? 9 s ® to last long. In m y despatch No. fLI forwarded a translation of the ambitious 1 and high-fauRin^ programme of the principal club, which assuredly could not [28—31]'2 have been drawn up by the local leaders without (shall one say) Caucasian assistance. I have discussed these clubs several times with my Soviet colleague (who, of course, denies any Soviet connexion with them at all) and pointed out the undesirable character of many of the leaders and the stupid inflammatorv speeches they make to the members, warning him that sooner or later they wilP cause trouble here. M. Koulagenkov said that if the local police have real grounds for complaint they should arrest the ringleaders; my reply was that I knew they would not do so without being sure of Russian consent, and a few days later he told me that he had spoken to the Soviet Colonel Commandant here, who had declared himself willing to offer support to the Persian authorities if they asked for it. A week ago I informed both the Governor-General and the Chief of Police of this, but they seem very hesitant and afraid of taking definite action. It seems to me that the Chief of Police might act, although he knows that his police are mostly frightened and unreliable, but that the Governor-General is temporising for some reason or other. Possibly they wish to shelter them selves in case of any awkward incident either behind the Soviet authorities or even behind this consulate. A day or two ago I received an unofficial inter mediary from the Governor-General, saying he wished to effect some arrests and wanted my opinion. I could only repeat what I had said before, adding that time was going by with no action taken, in spite of continual Persian complaints against these clubs. Later I learnt that the Governor-General thinks that the threat of arrest is causing the committee to go into hiding and the clubs to be faced with closing down. 4. So great is the Persian dislike of decision or responsibility that lately Tabriz is full of stories that the British Consul is to blame for the present state of unrest and disorder, which could quickly be ended if he “ dealt firmly ' with the Russians, as he was supposed to have done last September and October, but that since the signing of the treaty he has stood back idly and left everything to the Persians! They apparently do not see, or at least do not admit, that there is any difference between last autumn, when I was obliged to act as a kind of liaison between a makeshift Persian Administration, paralysed with fright, on the one hand, and a purely military, somewhat unimaginative and inexperienced Soviet force, on the other hand. Now there is a full Persian Administration supposed to be functioning normally, able to consult with a trained and reasonably friendly Soviet Consul-General, working with a comparatively small, almost nominal garrison in the town. But the Persians either cannot or will not collaborate as they should do and might be expected to do, and it almost seems at times as if some of them do not really wish for complete order and tranquillity in the town, which would be perhaps too good an advertisement for the well-behaved but still hated Russians. I myself am sometimes inclined to think that the Governor- General, either acting on his own or on orders received from Tehran, wishes to force the Soviet authorities to permit the return of Persian troops to Tabriz by showing that the police and gendarmerie by themselves cannot keep order. 5. ° It is certain that the police enjoy little respect. The Kurds, who con tinually visit Tabriz, are again walking about the streets with revolvers and cartridge-belts bravely showing, although they know that the local administration objects to this. I have told the Chief of Police that the Soviet authorities are willing also to support him in dealing with this particular problem, but he seems to hesitate to act. A few days ago he decided to arrest a doubtful character, after consulting the Soviet Consul-General; the next day a body of “ committee-men ” went to his house, all armed with rifles or revolvers, and demanded the man’s release. Instead of answering them as a Persian officer backed by 400 armed police, he replied that he must first consult the Soviet authorities (thus making it appear as if the Russians had instigated the arrest), and asked them to call again next day. The £ ‘ committee ” apparently swallowed this, but were too prudent to call next day, when he presumably had other precautions ready. It is obvious that firm measures have to be taken' sooner or later, when a self-appointed imitation trade union can walk about armed and query any action of the lawful authorities. . . 6. The local newspaper, Azerbaijan, has again become more abusive and outspoken against the so-called rich and dangerous parasites who still fatten on peasants and workers and are still supported by those who are in charge of the political and economic affairs of the country. The latter are called Government autocrats intent on smashing the workers by all kinds of new repressive regula-3 tions, and on destroying their rights instead of protecting them. Lhe latest article warns the officials that, as long as the workers’ rights have not been sa ^“ guarded or new agrarian reforms carried out, revolution and disorder cannot be sUryed off and will grow greater instead of less. ^ 7. The local authorities in Tabriz now have about 1,500 unemployed men working on the streets, cleaning ditches and planting trees, &amp;c., the usual pav being 5 or 6 rials per day. In addition, there are schemes afoot for helping small craftsmen, such as stocking-makers, cobblers and leatherworkers, with small advances of money and raw materials to tide them over their present difficulties. The police had the idea of distributing a small dole to certain of the “ refugees who do not benefit by any other scheme and are certainly not likely to be helped by private charity here, but such a large and uncontrollable crowd collected that the doors were kept locked and the wretched people sent empty away. 8. Local commerce and trade conditions are bad and show no improvement. One factory owner says he will be able to start a new textile industry in a few months with the German machinery he received last year. I am told however, that the important contract expected to be signed in Tehran between the Soviet authorities and tw^o Tabriz leather factories remains unsigned after several months of negotiations. One curious fact is that the large market m carpets appears to continue brisk, although the export of carpets to Turkey and Switzer land has temporarily been stopped by the British authorities m Bagdad, w n e the export to New York remains comparatively small. Probably, some general merchants, unable to use their liquid capital, are investing in carpets and moving them to other supposedly safer parts of the country, or hoping to sell them o German-occupied Europe later. The exodus of better-class families from a mi/, to Tehran, Isfahan and other towns still continues on a lesser scale, and one still sees lorries piled high with furniture and household effects leaving Azerbaijan for the south. It is of no use telling officials and merchants that they are encouraging disquiet and unrest in this way, and that the poor and working classes will soon be the onlv ones left here, a prey to unemployment and possible social revolution. In Persia the only sentiment, open and unashamed is everyone for himself and the devil (in this case supposedly a Bolshevik outbreak oi the German spring offensive) take the hindmost. t , , 9. There is little new r s from the Kurdish area of Azerbaijan, except that a meeting of about a dozen important Kurdish chieftains, including one hheikn Abdulla, formerly a fugitive in Iraq, is reported to have taken pi ace recently in Saui Bulagh. The brother of the chief rebel leader Mohamed Rashid Khan is said to have been killed. Amir Aund, chief of the Dehbukri tribe has succeeded in ousting the Kurdish farmendar of Mandoab from his post and installing one of his own relations, in spite of the Governor-General s repeated warnings that such action would not be tolerated. So little did he fear the consequences that he came last week to Tabriz and has now gone to Tehran on a semi-official invitation. Visitors from Rezaieh report the town entirely quiet since m} \isit in January, although there are minor incidents in the villages, including attacks on Aimenidii Christians The Governor-General last week paid a visit to Sarab, which haa been the centre of much banditry and disorder until recently, and reports that all classes of the inhabitants are almost overwhelmingly relieved at the restoration of law and order in the district. According to him the “ Arbabs,” or village landowners, generally represented as grinding down the poor, are being welcomed back by their peasants after the taste which the latter have had of “ liberty.” 10. It is to be hoped that the peasants wall settle down m time to think about proper sowing for the next harvest. In the Ariebil-Serab a rea the autumn ? and winter sowings were admittedly much below r normal because of distuibed conditions, but the local authorities say that in the rest oi Azeibaijan theie is nothing to complain of on this score. However, such is not the impression I gained at Rezaieh. and I have heard pessimistic accounts of short sowing from other persons in Tabriz also. Local opinion is still strongly opposed to allowing any surplus wheat to leave Azerbaijan for Tehran or any other part of Persia, but I know that considerable quantities have recently left the Himmeh district for the capital. On the other hand, the growers and exporters of locally produced dried fruits are finding their stocks piling up in Tabriz and other centres with no prospect of sale, and will soon be faced with ruin. Wool also is unsaleable, and the new clip will shortly be here to worsen matters. Germany was tho principal buyer before, with Russia a lesser outlet; neither are buying now,4 and the British market is not interested, partly because of the high cost of transportation to the nearest Persian Gulf port. 11. Pro-German and anti-allied talk and sentiment seem to have been increasing lately, and there is no doubt that our set-backs in the Far East ai^? having their effect. If we imagine that any Persians (except perhaps a fe^ self-seeking or time-serving individuals in Tehran) like or appreciate us any the more for the treaty, we are likely to be mistaken. Nobody here expects the Russians to adhere to their undertaking to leave Persia after the peace, and. while we ourselves may perhaps be regarded as more likely to keep our word, the fact of our signing the treaty at all can easily be construed by the oriental mind into a sign of nervousness or weakness on our part. I have never heard the slightest expression of gratitude for all the wheat, sugar and other supplies we are well known to have brought into Persia, and the result of all the money we are bringing month by month into the country is to encourage attempts to lower the rate for sterling, pounds and Iraq dinars having been offered last week in the bazaar here for 120 rials. Among the ignorant general population the present position does not matter much, as they are firmly convinced of a welcome and benevolent German rule here before many months. Other intelligent Persians whom I have discussed matters with are generally pessimistic, and frankly say that they see no hope for their country except in some kind of friendly foreign control—possibly British, but definitely not Russian. Even the Governor- General, who is a former ambassador, and is thought to cherish hopes of ministerial position one of these days, has privately told me that it would be a good thing if Persia could have foreign advisers in some departments, as the Belgian customs officials and Swedish gendarmerie officers in days gone by. i Nobody seems to think it possible to find a strong and efficient Government among the present crowd of politicians, and very few people respect us for our desire to ; j leave the administration entirely in such hands. I have even heard of assertions that the hard times under the old Shah were better than the present confused and anxious regime under a Government which does not know its own mind and gets nothing whatever done. It is possible that the extraordinary admiration for the Germans and wishes for their arrival here have something to do with appreciation of the German thoroughness and organisation which were particularly displayed in Tabriz and Tehran, even when they included penetration , of and interference with the native administration. We at present seem to have, nothing to offer them except democracy, which educated Persians from past experience (in Azerbaijan at any rate), fear and dislike, and which they do not know how to adapt to their own pressing needs.

L ' XJATrT , , Tehran, March 16, 1942. ! *, * ^ the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch from Tabriz, No. 6 of the 26th February, in which His Majesty s Consul gives a translation from the Azerbaijan 1 urkish dialect of the Programme and Desires of the Azer baijan W orkers ( ommittee. Hie mere comprehensiveness of the programme establishes, as Mr. Cook suggests, a foreign origin, and there are many touches which point straight to Soviet Russia, e.g., the demands for the protection of the vernacular theatre, for the absorption into productive factory work of the inmates of brothels, and for the equality of women with men in social and political affairs —all matters remote from the views of the oriental and the Moslem. I mentioned this programme to my Soviet colleague as the kind of thing that did us great harm in adding to the suspicion of the Turkish Government that Soviet Russia had designs on Azerbaijan. M. Smirnov not only denied that there could be any Soviet influence at work here, but so far forgot his excellent sense of humour as to suggest that an enemy had done this: there were, he said, many signs of “ provocation ” in Azerbaijan. 2. It is possible that the Soviet authorities, having been obliged to retreat somewhat in their encouragement of the Kurds and other minorities and to be more accommodating in the matter of the installation of adequate numbers of Persian police and gendarmes in Azerbaijan, are turning more attention to political parties. It seemed to me that M. Smirnov took a keener interest in the recent Cabinet crisis than he had ever taken in Tehran politics before. He spoke to me strongly in favour of Qawam-al-Saltana as a possible Premier, and from the Qawam we learn that M. Smirnov sent for him and made much of him: and now we have this programme of political and social demands which, for all that it is more discreet than inviting Kurdish leaders to visit Baku and refusing to alknv the Persian Government to keep adequate numbers of police at Rezaieh, has yet a separatist tendency which can only help to confirm the suspicion with which Soviet policy in Azerbaijan is regarded by the Persian and Turkish Governments. 3. A copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz, and copies, with copies of the enclosures, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, and to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Angora Bagdad, Cairo and Kuibyshev.

They say that the ordinary local printers do not know how to set up type in the dialect, and only print in Persian. It is difficult for the Persians also to believe that among the^_ local down-trodden and politically-undeveloped proletariat there has suddenly^^ sprung up a body of leaders capable of compiling unaided such an ambitious, all-embracing, albeit mostly half-baked, programme. 1 I have, &amp;c.

The situation was less disturbed than a few months previously, but armed burglaries and killings persisted in Tabriz. Numerous committees and clubs had sprung up in the town with programmes of social reform. The Persians averred that these clubs enjoyed Russian backing. Disputes were going on among the various chieftains in Kurdish Azerbaijan. Two Russian soldiers had been attacked while patrolling the railway line near Julfa. The Soviet authorities had allowed Persian troops to garrison Ardebil, but appeared to be opposing the sending of garrisons to Rezaieh or Tabriz. The Consul feared that alarmist reports from Tabriz were giving people in Tehran an exaggerated idea of conditions there and preventing the return of 'voluntary exiles'.

Tabriz, February 20, 1942. situation in the Tabriz district I HAVE the honour to report that the remains disturbed, but on a minor scale compared with a month or two ago. Apart from the fighting on the Kurdistan border, there have been no large outbreaks of banditry in the last fortnight, although plenty of bandits are in being in most parts of Azerbaijan. In Tabriz itself the position is still unsatisfactory because of the continual armed burglaries and killings, which arouse or sustain the feeling of trepidation or almost panic among all classes except the poorest, who have nothing to lose. While these burglaries are probably less numerous than before the Russian entry, it is the bold and ruthless nature of the house breakers which causes alarm. Before it was the houses of unpopular officials and rich upstart merchants which suffered, and police complacency or connivance in the robberies was often hinted at or taken for granted, but now no respectable family feels safe from the ruffianly strangers who swarm in the town and are invariably saddled with every crime or misdeed, while it is now Soviet complacency, if not connivance, which is suspected by all. 2. These strangers are mostly the “ muhajirs” or refugees from the U.S.S.R. who were kept well in hand by the authorities in recent years and mostly forced to live in out of the way villages, but are now able to defy all regulations and have come to the town in search of work, money and a less down-trodden existence. They all speak Russian, of course, and some hob-nob with the Soviet troops, especially with those from the Caucasus. Their presence is highly resented by all classes of society here, although they cannot all be criminals. While Persians in general now take their own greater liberties and freedom from fear and restraint for granted, they apparently hate to see these shared by what they consider as undesirable intruders—and this extends also to the Armenians and Assyrians, who are expected to remain ground down and unprivileged as before, and among whom any attempt at self-expression or self-assertion in these unsettled times is regarded as alarming and revolutionary, and as certainly connected with sinister Soviet influences. 3. My last despatch mentioned the sudden appearance in Tabriz of a number of “committees” or clubs, some of a “proletarian” label. These at present form the chief topic of conversation and theme for apprehension, although most of them are probably harmless. One particular one in the Armenian quarter is stated by everyone to be nothing but a collection of Kurdish, Azerbaijani and Armenian undesirables, living on robberies and blackmail, and prepared to sell protection to any wrongdoer who will join. All these clubs are issuing prospec tuses and invitations to all and sundry, and the somewhat backward working-men here are puzzled how to de al with all Jfie alluring offers of social reform, not to T 27 — 93 ] IrECo.MMu.CEPtT -9 APR1942 -INDIA OFFICE..mention social evenings, some of which clash with one another. One deputation of mild-mannered workers from a leather factory who visited the Oovernoi - General here to ask for better wages and hours had great difficulty in presenting their case owing to the wrangling of various committee ’ officials who claimed quite gratuitously to be representing them. Needless to say, the Persian public 0 ^ accuses the Soviet Political Bureau of ^backing these proletarian growths, although such ££ anjumans ' are nothing myw in Tabriz history in times of stress. The police aver they have watched uniformed Russian officers coming out of one club, while the Soviet Consul-General firmly denies any Russian connexion what ever. I am told on good authority that the newly-joined members of this club were told to try and keep the whole matter secret from the British Consul. It is really extraordinary (and perhaps somewhat unfortunate) that this consulate is widely regarded here as a kind of George from outside keeping the poisonous revolutionary (i.e., Bolshevik) dragon in some sort of order. If any such hyper bole were called for, a more suitable simile would perhaps be the unfortunate Hercules and the hydra, since as fast as the Soviet “ Politruk are dissuaded or publicised out of one form of unwarranted or undesirable activity, their meddling and often stupid energies seem to spring up in some other similar sphere. 4. I have mentioned how one of these ££ proletarian ” clubs had set itself up as a kind of court to hear cases of complaints brought by workmen against employers. Last week, when a band of six housebreakers were brought to the police court to be tried, a group of so-called ££ committee-men ” rose and asked noisily why the accused had been arrested and why they should be tried. Presumably they expected to overawe the police (as they do in smaller places) and obtain their fellows’ release, but this time the police were strong enough to arrest them in addition for contempt of court. But it is small incidents like these which make the middle-class and law-abiding citizens nervous. 5. The bandit Hussein Ghuli, who was disturbing the Maragha district two months ago until driven into the mountains, recently came to Maragha and asked for a free pardon, which was granted. The chief of gendarmerie there even appointed him as an officer in their ranks, but shots were heard in the middle of the night and he ran away. The Persian officials say that they know this was arranged by the Russian political service, who secretly support the bandit and did not want him to surrender. Only a few days later, however, Hussein Ghuli again appeared and this time took up his post as gendarmerie officer. Within a few days loud complaints began to come from the surrounding villages, saying that the new uniformed guardian of law and order was fleecing and robbing them worse than he did as a brigand before. The Governor-General of Tabriz has hurriedly demanded that he should be transferred to this town for appoint ment to some other province, but it is expected that he will take to the mountains again instead. 6. In the Kurdish districts of Azerbaijan there are disputes going on among the various chieftains. Amir Asad, in particular, is trying to have Mejid, the Kurdish Farmandar of Miandoab, removed from office and his own nominees appointed, but the Governor-General is standing firm. There is no news from the Saqqiz area (no longer in Azerbaijan), where General Mahmoud Amin was recently killed. Last week a Persian officer arrived here saying that he had escaped from the Kurds after being taken prisoner in that fight. His story was that a body of 500 Kurds in Saqqiz sent word to General Amin in Diwan Here that they were ready to make terms and surrender. Amin impetuously pushed on there without making sure of the facts or asking for hostages or a surrender of arms beforehand, and actually arrived in the town at about 4 a.m. one dark night. Firing began and the general rushed forward shouting: “I am Amin, cease firing.” Instead, he and about fifteen officers were killed, the rest being captured. The Kurds next day began executing officers, but after seven had been shot, the leader, Mohamed Rashid, is said to have intervened and saved the others. The escaped officer says that the Kurdish rebels numbered between 2,000 and 3,000. 7. Two Soviet soldiers patrolling the railway line near Julfa were attacked about ten days ago, one being killed and the other wounded. This is a most unusual incident, and may be the work of Karadaghi tribesmen from the hills, keen to get rifles. A well-known bandit named Mohamed Tagi was recently killed by the Persian gendarmes near Ardebil. The Soviet authorities have3 allowed Persian troops to return to garrison the latter town, but so far none have come to Rezaieh or Tabriz, although the Governor-General has^ twice been informed that forces have actually left Tehran for this province. The Russian Consul-General here is very non-committal on this subject and says that he has ^Jj^eard nothing of such troops coming here, which seems to indicate that the Soviet authorities are not in favour of their coming. My Soviet colleague seems a reasonable and sensible man, well disposed towards this consulate, but at present somewhat overweighted by the military and military-political elements here. He takes his work very seriously, and after six weeks says that he needs another month in order to size up the situation before he can take a day or two off and visit the neighbouring districts. He says that, in his opinion, the Persian gendarmerie are not making a real effort to restore or preserve order in Azer baijan, hinting that they are interested in the continuance of disorder—which is just the accusation made by the Persians against the Soviet political branch here. On the other hand, he was complaining a few days ago (not for the first time) that the gendarmerie were being culpably ruthless in their treatment of certain troubled areas. According to the Governor-General, he was referring to the tracking down by the gendarmes of a gang of murderers who had killed eight members of one family in the Ahar district and cut all their bodies into little pieces before throwing them down a mountain-side. As a matter of fact, M. Koulagenkov is probably partially right in both of his conflicting statements, but they are almost certainly put into his mouth by the scheming and opportunist Politruk, which fact takes away a good deal of their weight. 8. There has lately been an unfortunate polemic going on between certain Tehran newspapers (including Ittilat, Kushish and Pareham) and Azerbaijan ideologists which does no good by bitter and exaggerated accusations of separatism, and may do harm, both by causing local resentment and by spreading unjustified alarm in Tehran and other parts of Persia regarding the situation here. It is true that some months ago one or two Azerbaijan journals and a few short-lived societies here made some over-enthusiastic claims for the use of the local dialect instead of Persian, and for a larger local share in the administration of this part of Persia, but not enough to justify the charges of separatism, malevolence and wilful disorder now made in Tehran. It is said that lately Tabriz newspapers have been stopped in the post on the way to Tehran, and that the Government has been preventing their sale or circulation there. Responsible circles in the capital should remember that there are many people here interested in presenting as dark a picture as possible, and also far too many poor-spirited Tabrizis of the upper classes idling away their time as voluntary exiles in Tehran, anxious to excuse their refusal to return to this district by spreading exaggerated descriptions of conditions here. It would be a very good thing if the Persian Government would force the majority of these people to come back, and thus stop the exodus which still continues. Rightly or wrongly it is said that in Tehran life is so comparatively care-free, and pleasures still so gay, that one can forget there that there is a war on or a foreign occupation of parts of the country which apparently acts as a powerful attraction on the neurotic and character less middle-class women who have remained here so far.

Sir, Tabriz, February 9, 1942. I HAVE the honour to report that conditions in Tabriz and district have improved during the last ten days since the signing of the treaty, and as far as public order and security are concerned there are grounds for hoping that they may soon return to normal. But life in general will not return to normal until some parts of the Persian Administration are recast and reformed, and until the middle-class and official elements shed some of their craven fears, which seems unlikely. 2. A fortnight ago the situation round Sarah, a small town between Tabriz and Ardebil, was bad, peasants and tribesmen from the surrounding areas having disarmed or driven out the gendarmerie, robbed or threatened the landowners, and even carried off some of their women and children into the countryside. The Governor-General of Tabriz said quite openly to the Soviet authorities and to myself that this was only the logical outcome of the underhand Russian political officers’ intrigues which had been going on for some time in the Sarab district, notably from an individual named Bagaroff, moving continually between Tabriz and Ardebil. He was known by the gendarmerie to have incited the inhabitants against the landowners, and to 'have organised peasant ‘ ‘ committees ’' in various places. The rioters and malcontents consequently believed themselves to be acting under Russian protection, and the gendarmerie felt powerless to act against them. The Soviet Consul-General of course denied this imputation, but told me he was sending three Soviet officers with the Persian gendarmes who were going to Sarab to restore order, so that these might help to calm down the inhabitants. One of the officers sent turned out to be Bagaroff. 3. On the 1st February the bazaar community of Tabriz was shaken by the exploits of three gangsters with revolvers who held up a well-known merchant in his office in a large caravanserai, robbed him, forbade him to leave within a certain time, and calmly escaped. Immediately a number of merchants packed their bags and prepared to leave for Tehran. Others formed a delegation to the Ustandar to protest against the insecurity prevailing in the town. I am glad to say that he had a'few well-chosen words to say to them about their own cowardice in letting such a hold-up occur in a busy part of the bazaar, without anyone daring to interfere or stop the criminals or even cry for help until it was all well over. ... 4. Although conditions in Rezaieh are reported to continue quiet, the hundreds of Rezaiotes who fled here some weeks ago refuse to return. Some say the lull is a temporary one, and others say they will not return because of the danger of the German'attack through Turkey scheduled for the spring, in which Rezaieh will feel the first shattering blow.5. The situation in Kurdish Azerbaijan remains quiet, although there is reported to be fighting at Saqqiz, not far away to the south, between the (io\ern- ment forces under Sartip Amin aud the Kurds under Mohamed Rashid My impression is that the Kurds in the Sauj Bulagh area are not anxious to be caught between the Persian forces and the Soviet army, which would presumably reacts quickly if the situation got out of hand so near its occupied zone. Moreover, some of the Kurdish chieftains do not seem to be so happy as they were with the present undefined position, in which Persian Government is almost completely absent in their tribal areas, while Russian political officers, full of apparent human kindness and subversive Communist ideas, flit about continually among their henchmen in town and village. I have been in touch with Amir Asad, chieftain of the Debukri tribes, who declares that he is going shortly to the Saqqiz area to try and make peace with General Shahbakhti’s forces on behalf of the Kurds. He is willing to organise a force of mounted Kurdish police to keep order in the SaujT-Bulagh-Baneh area under the nominal auspices of the Tehran Government; the latter are believed to have approved in theory but have not provided—the monthly subsidy first required. There is now a Farmandar at Sauj Bulagh, who seems surprisingly enough acceptable to the Kurds there, but he is as timid as the rest. Amir Asad says that they might even allow the gendarmerie to return there, but not of the former cruel, corrupt and rapacious type; unfortunately there is no other, until the service has been reorganised from top to bottom, especially as regards the officers. 6. The Kurdish chieftains probably realise that any idea of independence is impossible; they would, however, like to have Kurdish officials in their own districts, as in Northern Iraq, not far away. I asked whether Azerbaijani officials appointed by Tehran would not be suitable; the reply was that such might be more sympathetic in some ways, but would probably work for local interests and not properly serve those of the Central Government. On the other hand, a Tehran official of the usual type would neglect or ride roughshod over Azerbaijani interests and susceptibilities and use his authority to line his own pockets as quickly as possible. As I have said before, there seems to be no official patriotism towards Persia as a whole any more. 7. The Kurds no longer walk about in Tabriz armed with pistols and rifles, and this must be due to local Soviet intervention, following the complaints of the Governor-General and the chief of police, who would not have dared to check the practice on their own initiative. Enquiries I have made in Kurdish circles seems to show that the Soviet authorities did not furnish arms and ammunition to the Kurds as alleged by all the Persian officials; the arms were bought freely in Tabriz by private Kurds, but in order to get them safely to their own district past the Persian police posts along the road they applied for a Soviet officer to escort the car or lorry concerned, and it appears that the Russians did kindly provide the officer. This doubtless explains the story described in paragraph 6 of my despatch No. 1. 8. The Russian political officers who frequently visit Sauj Bulagh and district (which is apparently not in the Soviet occupied zone) are named Alieff, Nabieff and Salim. They are said to have promised a printing press to someone in Sauj Bulagh. In Miandoab they are reported to be in close touch with the Farmandar, a Kurd named Mehdi, wffio although appointed by the Governor- General at Tabriz is alleged to sport a portrait of Bakhirofi, President of the Soviet Azerbaijan Republic, in his office. Certain Kurds from Sauj Bulagh. doubtless in order to obtain preferential Russian sugar and cotton goods from the Soviet agency in Tabriz, or perhaps for more mischievous but equally petty and selfish reasons, actually applied for Soviet citizenship to the consulate- general here recently. Far from being repulsed, their applications were received and officially considered (as I know for a fact), although they can have no possible ties with the U.S.S.R. whatever. Disillusion came when they were told that their wives and grown-up children must also say whether they wished equally to become Soviet citizens, and they seem to have sheered off from the idea. Incidentally the Soviet Consulate-General has been receiving an average of thirty applications per day (sometimes as many as fifty) for Soviet citizenship from nominal Persian subjects, but largely including nondescripts who formerly belonged to the Caucasus and drifted here between 1928 and 1935—the so-called “ muhajirs ” or refugees. It is possible that some will be accepted and return to Soviet territory, and I do not imagine that the local Persian authorities will3 express or feel any regrets at losing such a detested and mostly undesii able element. 9. The demagogic movement in favour of Azerbaijan autonomy ana democracy in general on which I was reporting in iabriz a month or two ago /fc^eems to have faded out almost completely. It is possible that the Russian political bureau realised on what unreliable and broken reeds they were basing their surreptitious hopes—as I half-facetiously warned them at the time. Instead the city is now invested with several so-called 11 committees, one of which styles itself “ Committee for the Protection of the Proletariat of Azerbaijan. About a week ago it was learnt to be summoning landowners or employers to appear before it to decide on complaints brought against them by aggrieved members of the said proletariat. One such unwilling defendant ventured to inform the police, who made enquiries and found that the leading light was a Soviet citizen named Ismailoff. Before arresting the “committee” the chief of police saw the Soviet Consul-General, who is said to have asked him to delay action while he made enquiries. After a few days my colleague asked for a further delay for enquiries, and there the matter still rests. It must be getting tiresome for him continually to have to deny or cover up the stupidities and intrigues of another department over whom he has no control and of whos^ goings-on he probably has little knowledge until they are pointed out to him b\ the Governor-General or myself. . , 10. I am told that the old man who was recently Deputy for Sauj Bulagh and its district has now resigned and returned to his village, so that the area is unrepresented in the Tehran Majlis, and its problems not made known to the Central Government. This is probably all the more true because the Sauj Bulagh area is normally under Rezaieh, where administration is practically broken down and communications at present non-existent, so that the Governor- General of Tabriz is having to do most of the work piecemeal as it arises, possibly without reporting on that district to Tehran. One Kurdish chieftain has suggested that Sauj Bulagh should be attached to the Kermanshah Province, so as &amp; to prevent Russian political officers from interfering there as they do at present. A new Deputy would certainly seem advisable. 11. The cost of living here is causing anxiety, and imported goods which cannot be easily replaced are soaring in price. It is well known that certain merchants have bought up and hoarded stocks, but no one expects the Administration to take any steps in the matter. Fortunately supplies of bread and sugar are sufficient, but rice is dear and cotton piece-goods excessi\elv so. The fringe of the unemployment problem is being touched by relief works, from which labourers receive 6 rials per day. . 12. When I mentioned to the Governor-General of labriz that m Kezaieti the policemen were still only receiving the miserable and inadequate pay of 120 rials a month instead of the 240 rials to which they were now entitled, he said he felt practically sure that the authorities there had received the full amount for the proper pay rolls. It seems difficult, even allowing for the incredibly corrupt Administration in these parts, to suppose that the whole of the bonus has vanished so far into higher officials’ pockets, and yet it is not impossible. I have heard that the recent Chief of Gendarmerie m Azerbaijan, who practically deserted his post when conditions became too difficult for his timid and disappointing personality, left for Tehran with a whole lorry-load of miscellaneous stuff, supposed to be contraband acquired in the Rezaieh area with money squeezed out of the district (perhaps the gendarmes’ extra pay) I myself saw this loaded lorry outside his office on the evening he left, and wondered what it was. since everyone knew he had not brought his family or furniture here when he came a few months ago. However, he is related to someone in the Ministry, and will doubtless immediately receive another good post. Another case is where a detachment of gendarmes were known to ha\e seized twenty-five rifles in one village, but the arms were never handed in. When enquiries were made, it was found that the gendarmes had sold the rifles back again to peasants or tribesmen and pocketed the money. After all, how can a man keep a wife and family on 4 rials, or 6^., a day? There must be plenty of similar cases, and it is useless for the Persian Government to complain about the dangerous number of rifles stolen or unaccounted for while such conditions obtain among the guardians of public order. Until the whole of the corrupt officers are changed, however,4 it is of little use expecting the wretched half-starved gendarmes to be more honest or efficient. 13. I am informed by the Soviet authorities that Persian troops are to be allowed to return to Ardebil, and the Governor-General tells me that Tabriz and Rezaieh also will shortly have Persian garrisons. This will undoubtedly lead to an increase in public confidence locally. 14. A party was held at this consulate on the evening of the 3rd February to celebrate the signature of the treaty. Invitations were sent to seventeen leading Persian officials and notables, thirteen Soviet officials and military officers, and ten others, including American, Polish, Free French, Turkish and Iraqi represen tatives and the small British community. Only one out of the seven Soviet military officers invited attended the party, without their sending any explana tions at the time, but the Political Commissar came two days later to say that they had some work to do. I feel sure that their unexpected and noticeable absence (for which the Political Commissar was almost certainly responsible) caused some surprise to the Persians and other foreigners present, but the atmosphere of the party was very friendly and even cordial throughout.

Enclosure. Consul Cook to Sir R. Bullard. A*vsXr ^ (No. 2. Confidential.) . T gj r Tabriz, January 28, 1942. I HAVE the honour to report that, in accordance with your^telegram No. 3 : — I have paid a visit to Rezaieh to see whether the situation tnefewas as bad as described in rumours current during the last few weeks in Tabriz, wheie abou 1,000 refugees had arrived because of the alleged lack of security in the town and district west of Lake Urumia. 2. Various telegrams sent by me during the first half of the month wilt have described reports that a Terrorist Committee formed of mixed Azerbaijani, Kurdish, Armenian and Assvrian elements was in virtual control of the town of Urumia,’ that many officials^ were leaving because they had been threatened or (as they pretend) because they could not carry on usefully in the face of such difficulties and lack of authority, that robberies and killings were rife in the town, and that hundreds of middle-class landowners, merchants and professional men were abandoning their properties and callings and were flocking to Tabriz, with a most disquieting effect on the already nervous population here. 3. Before leaving Tabriz I called on the Soviet Consul-General to inform him of my departure next day, and to discuss the rumours of disorder in Rezaieh. He said he thought that there was much exaggeration going on. that the Persian authorities there could keep order if they really wished, and that if there were disorders these were possibly caused by Fascist agents-provocateurs. This last argument I heard later from the Russian authorities in Rezaieh, and feel sure that it emanates from the Politruk department in order to hide up or excuse their own misdoings, especially when things get somewhat out of hand, on the same lines presumably as the accusations of sabotage in the famous wreckers trials in Moscow a few years ago. I did not stress all that I had heard from various sources about the Rezaieh position, especially the charges of Soviet interference and obstruction, but gave him to understand that my journey had been planned for sometime and that I wished to know whether the rumours were false, adding that my visit might perhaps encourage the timid Persian officials to keep’better law and order—in the interests of Soviet and British policy alike. M. Koulagenkoff professed to welcome my going, and said that his people had already decided to help the local authorities in Rezaieh to keep order. 4/ It is a fact that the Soviet forces there did begin on that day and the next to patrol the town and generally take the situation in hand. I did not arrive in Rezaieh on the 18th January as planned, owing to a blizzard and heavy snowstorms which forced me back before reaching Marand. By the time 1 got there, on the 20th January, everyone admitted that the state of the town was much easier, that the nightly robberies had stopped and that the terrorist elements had apparently ceased their activities and were lying low. [27—66] \ I2 5. On the next day I called first on the Farmandar, who was left acting as Ustandar when General Cupal departed so hurriedly the week before. I found an elderly man of 68 with a quavering voice and feeble gait, a reputed opium- smoker but undoubtedly intelligent and in no mind to quit his post with the rest. In fact, he expressed himself as anxious to be properly appointed as Acting Governor-General by Tehran as soon as possible, instead of being left to carrjj^ on without proper authority. In the course of a long conversation I found tlu general position much as it was at Tabriz a few months ago, with the same story of a collapse of administrative discipline, helplessness and incompetence among the police and gendarmerie, nervousness of the Russians and critical misgivings at their non-co-operation on the one hand and their meddling and alleged disruptive tactics on the other, lack of social or civic sense among the middle-class population, and a readiness of the undesirable elements in town and country to take advantage of the unpopular Tehran administrations’s obvious weakness and lack of direction. «» 6. The Farmandar said that while General Cupal had had difficulties with the Soviet authorities, he himself had little to complain of from them, but he did wish they would leave him to maintain law and order without interference. t Only recently they had told him that the local police force must be reduced from 117 men to a figure of 54 only. He had demurred, pointing out that there were too few police already in view of the disturbed state of the district, but had thought best to dismiss fifteen men to begin with. Rezaieh had one hundred gendarmes, but only forty-six had had rifles until this week, when forty- four more arms arrived; such a force was completely unable to maintain security along the main roads and in the country districts and, in fact, had ceased thinking of doing so. Officers and men flatly refused to carry out their duties outside the town, and threatened to resign rather than do so. As a result, Government influence outside Rezaieh itself was practically nil; the landowners dared not visit their villages to collect their wheat and other dues, and so refused to pay the legal tax of 3 per cent, themselves. Any man of property in the countryside was liable to be robbed and (as had happened) murdered, while discontented elements, sometimes Armenian or Assyrian, had more or less set up independent village rule. In the town itself conditions were not much better. There had been a meeting in a principal mosque at which a crowd had resolved that the present Administration should be deposed, a committee of five appointed to govern the town, and a person named Sheikh Taha set up as Governor-General in place of General Cupal, who had fled. (Nothing more had come of this, however.) Hardly any taxes were being paid, except on small controlled commodities like opium and cigarettes. The peasants who brought produce into the town either refused to pay octroi-tax at the entrance, or paid what they thought fit, and the officials and police there were too nervous to deal with them. The leading local firm of distillers and wine-sellers openly refused to pay any excise-tax or put any tax- banderolles on their bottles, and had threatened an exciseman with a revolver when he called. On the other hand, there was a semi-secret committee who held meetings in a house near the governorate (and the Russian headquarters, too, incidentally), and who seemed to be developing some terrorist power over certain elements of the town’s population, especially Armenians and Assyrians. Their activities, and still more their rumoured and supposed activities, had been largely responsible for the exodus of officials and well-to-do merchants, as everyone was convinced that they were known to the Soviet authorities and had their approval and support. This committee contained some sinister individuals and was enlisting the support of others by threats and fear, while it was supposed to be maintaining itself by the nightly robberies and burglaries which took place in the ; town, without the police daring to interfere. I heard about this committee both from the refugees in Tabriz and from every individual I met in Rezaieh. and no amount of questioning or incredulity on my part would shake anyone’s belief in, and knowledge of, its existence, or of its being definitely in touch with the Russians. I also mentioned it to the Soviet Colonel Commandant in Rezaieh during my interview with him; as usual he at first denied any knowledge of such a body, and then said it must be a Fascist organisation and would be dealt with. Next day. according to confidential information received by the Farmandar. the Russians told the committee that it had to disperse.~ 3 [27—66] b 2 7. Before dealing with other problems, it would be well to describe the poor quality of the local police. My first impressions of them in Rezaieh were most unfavourable. They slouched along the pavements in twos or threes nanas in pockets, with a hang-dog look, mostly unshaven and unkempt, a few with black boots and leggings, some with khaki puttees and shoes, and one I saw with h ee l~ Jess slippers and white socks as part of his uniform. Ihe population take litt e ^r no notice of them at all. One I saw on duty at a principal crossing smoking a pipe, while a few yards away the main avenue was blocked with donkeys, whose owners had turned the spot into a standing market for wood and othei pioduce. I saw no police officers at all in the streets, because they were all too nervous to venture out. The chief of police had not been outside for a fortnight before my arrival and lived in one room with two policemen on guard outside. Everyone says that the bulk of the-policemen in Rezaieh are known to be inveterate opmm- . smokers and to be worthless as public guardians. The Farmandar admitted that they still only receive 120 rials a month (less than £1) as pay, although they weie officially promised 240 rials months ago. The Tehran authorities promised to send more money, but have not done so. At Dilman (Shahpur) I found that t policemen were getting 170 rials instead of 240. The gendarmerie are not in much better condition. Nobody seems to expect them to fight or resist wrong doers unless they outnumber the attackers, and they will not go into the countryside, where they are supposed to be. Their chief in Rezaieh is also a characterless heavy opium-smoker. No good can be done until both corps are reorganised and properly trained, regularly paid a living wage and taugnt some notion of their duties. At present they are half-paid, but do not earn even that, and use the disturbed state of the town and countryside as an excuse for their sloth instead of the reverse. One really cannot altogether blame the Russians for not actively co-operating with such a nondescript and slovenly lot o^ individuals. . , ^ 8. Although it appears that for some time the town had not been patrolled by police, when I arrived armed Soviet guards were patrolling the streets both at night and in the daytime, and everyone admitted that order was perfectly restored. One of the chief causes of police timidity was an attack by supposed villagers or Kurds about ten days before on a tax collector’s post at the chief entrance of the town, in which two police and two tax-gatherers were killed and one gendarme wounded. The assailants robbed their victims before killing them, and the police say they were overcome because their rifle bullets jammed in the barrels, so rubbishy were their cartridges. 4 he police also say their headquarters were attacked a few days afterwards in the main square of the town, but I heard on good authority that' a single shot went off outside and that the police inside began blazing away through the windows in all directions. 9. At the same time that the Soviet authorities decided to patrol the town themselves, they also pointed out a number of individuals inside the town and at a village nearby as suspected of the murderous attack mentioned above, and the Persian gendarmeries arrested these. This laudable act is, however, completely overshadowed in local eyes by the alleged interference of the Russians in demanding the release of certain criminals whom the gendarmerie had arrested on their own initiative for the murder of a rich man in a village. The most has been made of this story locally and in Tabriz, and doubtless it has been spread by now in Tehran. 1 found out (from a good Persian source) that actually two suspects were arrested and brought to Rezaieh (the Russians say at their instigation), but, owing to the dilatoriness of Persian justice, nearly two months elapsed without their even being charged. The Russians then told the Governor- General that either they should be sentenced or else set free, so he instructed the Public Prosecutor to begin proceedings immediately. No witnesses, however, could be found willing to testify against the accused, and so they were set free. That same evening the Director of Public Security was killed in public in the town, and it was, of course, alleged by everyone that the released criminals were responsible, and the Russians naturally doubly so. There is another story of the same kind which seems to have more foundation, in which a certain well-known thief named Jelal was arrested by the police in the town, but was almost immediately released by order of some junior Soviet officers. When the Russian Commandant was questioned about this by the Farmandar he pretended to have no knowledge of the affair.10. It was ostensibly these and similar set-backs that made General Cupal abandon his post and leave for Tehran. The truth appears to be, however, that he got himself into an impossible position by his bullying and insulting methods at the beginning of his tenure, going so far as to abuse Kurds in public and knock off their turbans. He seems also to have been unnecessarily stiff and tactless with the Russians, who probably made things no easier for him, until he was forcecL out of the place. During the last week or two he was obviously afraid of hi* life, having received threatening letters and messages, and was never without a strong guard, even taking two cars-full of police when he visited the telegraph ^ office, only a hundred yards or so from his official quarters. If Tehran is to retain control of Rezaieh and its frontier area, it must send better men, not necessarily military officers, but proved administrators with both courage and discretion, to handle the various tribes and races, as well as to rub along with the Soviet authorities on the spot. 11. I called on the Soviet Commandant on the first afternoon of my visit, and found him with a young civilian who turned out to be the new Soviet Vice- Consul at Rezaieh, not yet officially appointed to the post. The commandant is a cavalry colonel, probably a very good soldier, but I should say not a particularly clever administrator. The young vice-consul, who acted as interpreter, made most of the running at the interview, although he cannot have been long in the place. We did a lot more preliminary fencing than is usual even for a Russian interview, until they at last asked my views on the local Rezaieh situation. I told the commandant that I realised that the Persian Administration left a lot to be desired, but that the flight of 1,000 inhabitants to Tabriz was a somewhat doubtful advertisement for the Anglo-Soviet position in the country, and that while my post was at Tabriz on one of the main lines of communication between the U.S.S.R. and British supplies, I could not but be deeply interested in the state of the country flanking this line, and so on. I mentioned the murders and robberies which were undoubtedly taking place, and touched on the existence of subversive committees in the town and district. The commandant and vice- consul replied in the now usual way about provocative acts and Fascist instigation, and even accused some of those who had fled Rezaieh without their families, of having done so expressly to injure the Soviet! I merely mentioned the unsatis factory position of the local administration, its lack of sufficient competent forces to keep law and order, its timidity and confusion which complete Soviet aloofness would do nothing to cure, and suggested that a certain amount of moral support was called for, although I well knew that the Russian authorities insisted on not * interfering in the internal affairs of the country. Our interview was very polite * and friendly throughout, and yet I felt that the commandant was somewhat I nervous about my visit, which had undoubtedly been notified to him some days beforehand. On the following day I heard that he sent for the Farmandar and questioned him repeatedly about his conversation with me; at the end he said that it had been decided that the local authorities might have seventy-two police after all. 12. What I did not mention to the Russian Commandant, partly because I am becoming diffident of harping oq the same theme, and partly because I feel that no protests by me in Tabriz will remedy matters, was the evidence I found at Rezaieh, just as I have been finding at Tabriz, of the activities of the political officers, Politruk, N.K.V.D., or whatever the organisation may be called. While it must be said that the Persians, particularly the official and propertied classes, are only too ready to scent signs of Bolshevik and Communist activity among the r masses, my enquiries convince me that there is too much done in this regard by certain Soviet authorities, either from misplaced ideological zeal or because they cannot see anything amiss in doing so in another country, especially when they find conditions lending themselves so well for the purpose. There is no Persian medical organisation whatever in the country districts, and Soviet medical officers visit the villages with professional skill—and talk about how much better off and more cared for the peasants are in the U.S.S.R. Other officers in uniform visit the schools and give glowing descriptions of Soviet institutions, besides telling the pupils to insist on being taught in Azerbaijan Turkish instead of useless Persian. Such activities have an upsetting effect on the Persian teachers as much as or more than on the pupils. The masters (as I heard from one of them who spoke good English and I think did not exaggerate) do not know where they stand, or whether it is of any use continuing with a proper programme. Discipline is bad, both between headmasters and assistants, and between teachers5 and the pupils, who are getting out of hand. From most of the villages the Government teachers have been driven out, or so they say, by the peasants, particularly in the Armenian and Assyrian districts. They are idle in the town, and Tehran, they state, takes no notice of their telegraphic appeals for advice and assistance. The local director of education is known to have all packed ^H^ady for flight, which increases the general nervousness. Similarly, 1 heard of a soviet agricultural expert who visits the villages without the knowledge or assistance of the Persian agricultural officials, who have a Government farm- school near Rezaieh. I met one of these local officials who had been trained in America, and who said he would be very glad himself to co-operate with the Russian agronome and do together with him the best for the peasants in the f coming season. The impression I got, however, was that the Russian is interested as much in gradual propaganda as in agriculture. It is difficult to see how to check these political activities, the Soviet mentality being what it is, and the , state of this part of Persia being so favourable a soil at the present moment for their ideas. The peasants, whether Kurd, Armenian, Assyrian or ordinary Moslem, have been for years so browbeaten by the Persian officials and ] gendarmerie, and so fleeced and ground down by the landowner and middle-class ! element that when they now see the Government incapable of keeping order or administering the countryside, and find the landowner too frightened to stay among them or even visit them, they are ready to take matters into their own hands in an ignorant way and do without gendarmes, officials or landowners. The Russian officers who visit them, of course, are not likely to insist on restoring the social and economic status quo, and from all accounts are only too ready to suggest that the peasants should own their land and the product of their toil, and even form village committees to govern themselves for the time being. There may be nothing politically subversive about this in their opinion; they are doing what a religious missionary would presumably do if he found the forces and ; prestige of a heathen theocracy temporarily broken down, but it is doubtful whether they are not playing a dangerous game for all concerned in this part of the world, especially when their own Soviet Government repeatedly asserts its intention of not infringing the rights and the integrity of Persia. 13. It was interesting to learn from one landowner at Rezaieh that the minority of good and humane proprietors, who had not ill-used their peasants but had lent them money in times of need and taken an interest in their lives and welfare, were not being victimised now; on the contrary, the villagers, in some cases, stuck by them as an island in a surrounding sea of troubles. I have heard the same thing in the Tabriz district, and it seems to show that Bolshevik ideas would not have so very much scope if the Persian administrative stables could be properly cleansed and decent humane officials found instead of the corrupt and mostly unfeeling bureaucrats who hitherto have infested this area. 14. As regards the position of the peasants this year in the Rezaieh Province, I learnt from reliable sources that they have sown at least one-quarter short during the autumn sowings, and need advice about spring crops now if the next harvest is not to suffer. But their landowners have gone, there will be no money forthcoming for loans as before, the Government agricultural officials will not venture into the villages because the roads and conditions generally are so unsafe, and amid the turmoil and uncertainty the peasants have little or no confidence in the near future or even in the prospect of reaping the next crop. It may not be forgotten that little over twenty years ago these people saw their farms and crops ravaged year after year by warring Turks, Russians, Kurds and other Azerbaijanis, and it is not too fanciful for them to picture the same state of things over again. It will be a tragedy, however, if there is a crop-failure in the famous plain of Rezaieh, which has been described as the most fertile spot in all Asia, if this can be avoided by a little energetic action now. 15. The remedy for the present state of Rezaieh and its province is not easy to suggest or provide, but it will not be made easier by Tehran’s leaving things \ to second or third-rate representatives or letting them go by default. As far as I could ascertain, there is no movement there for political autonomy, cultural independence, democratic rights and so forth, as in the more sophisticated and demagogic milieu of Tabriz; peace and order and tolerable government is all that i the people I met asked for. The Soviet authorities must first be persuaded to allow efficient competent gendarmerie to preserve order along the main roads and in the non-Kurdish areas, and to allow the landowners and minor officials to6 return with safety to the villages, however galling or ideologically undesirable this may seem to their unwanted and unnecessary interfering political officers. The Persian gendarmes must be chosen from a different type, preferably from the country areas instead of from the towns, as at-^present. I he police must be better trained and paid, and made more self-respecting than the shabby nondescripts who serve little or no purpose as things are. I he higher oiticiaj^ should be better chosen and given more responsibility, with less bureaucracy an . centralisation among the lower officials. In the country districts there will have to be more freedom and less bullying, whatever the bureaucrats trained on the ex-Shah’s lines may think. The Farmandar of Rezaieh told me that the need for local bakshidars, or sub-governors of country districts, has been seen and discussed and agreed to by the Tehran authorities, but there are difficulties in getting the scheme under way. Two such sub-governors have been appointed in the Salmas district, but when an attempt was made to appoint one in a Kurdish area the usual Kurdish intertribal jealousy immediately displayed itself, and various chiefs came to Rezaieh to say that on no account could that^ nominee control oiy present their particular tribes. Thus, on the one hand no Kurd may be acceptable, and on the other no non-Kurd will think of accepting such a post until authority is restored and a posse of gendarmes sent with him to maintain it, neither of which conditions is feasible at present. At Sauj Bulagh (which is in the Rezaieh Ustan) the Kurdish notable, Chazi Mohamed, continues to keep order, with the nominal approval of the Tehran Government, by means of a force of mounted men, and sanction has been given to the adoption of this arrange ment among the Mamash tribes under Amir Azad, further west, but although the Farmandar has sent a message to the latter he has obtained no response as yet. 16. I would add a few odd impressions which may appear disjointed, but may have some bearing on what is written above. Along the roads every gendarmerie post outside the town is a ransacked ruin, with even windows and door-frames torn out, and I saw no gendarmes except in Khoi, Dilman and Rezaieh, where there are police also. The two largest official buildings in the main square of Rezaieh still show every window smashed from a bomb which fell five months ago. There are only three doctors left in that town of 50.000 inhabitants as against twenty-five before the Russian entry. Some of the twenty-two missing were military doctors who left with the fleeing troops, and the others have recently fled out of fright, including some employed at the Govern ment hospital. It is only too true what the Russian commandant said, that some of the leading men in Rezaieh went away to Tabriz during the last fortnight or three weeks leaving their wives and children behind to the supposed danger, partly out of a herd-like panic and partly probably because it was cheaper to leave them there. There are several Jews in Rezaieh, one of whom had his house burgled and the contents removed in carts, without any interference from anyone. One Persian official asked for an appointment to see me at the inn where I stayed, and, when I fixed 7 p.m., declined to come until next day, saying that no inhabitant of any standing went out of doors after 6 p.m. I myself went about after that hour and found it was true, although there was no curfew and although perfect order had admittedly been restored some days before by Soviet patrols. In the village of Burashan, near Rezaieh. a well-to-do villager was recently shot and killed by people on his own roof when he went out to see what was happening; he was followed by his wife, his son and the daughter of a neighbour, all of whom were killed one after another; the assailants then ransacked the house, forcing another son to show where any money or valuables were. This sounds like a Kurdish exploit, but there are such a number of desperados of various races reported in the district that identification is almost impossible. Many of the notorious “ refugees ” from the Caucasus are here as well as at Tabriz, and some Armenians are said to have come from Erivan. It is also stated that many of the Assyrians who had to flee in 1918 to Iraq are now profiting by the absence of frontier guards and returning to their old villages, where they must fend for themselves as best they can for a time. The Assyrian (Chaldean) bishop whom I met during my stay, however, doubted this story, but, as practically all the refugee Assyrians whom we installed in Iraq after the war were Nestorians, he may not have come across them yet. 17. One afternoon during my visit I went out shooting near an Assyrian villao-e and met some of the villagers. They seemed just as nervous as anyone else' ^and two who had been in Canada pressed me to help them to get back, one7 asking to join the British army. Several respectable Assyrians in the town itself told me that, if the Russians should be forced to leave suddenly for any reason, a terrible fate would befall themselves and the Armenians from the Kurds and ordinary Moslem inhabitants. This is most probably true; the wretched Christian communities have been bullied and persecuted for years by the ^-Shah’s minions on principle, and it is perhaps not surprising that some of ern are included in the “ committees ” of alleged trouble-makers or trouble- seekers, now that the hated Government is itself in difficulties in this province. It will be remembered that thousands of Assyrians were massacred or driven from this small area in the last war, and some of their ruined villages and fields have never been rebuilt or recovered. As it is, I was assured that many Christian villagers have now been forced to come to the town, where they have no means of livelihood except gradually to sell off their cattle and stock at ruinous prices. 18. In conclusion, it may be stated that the news of the arrival of a British Consul at Rezaieh—the first seen for several years—went round like wildfire, and from all accounts created a surprising impression, especially at the present juncture. Everyone who met my munshi, whom I took with me, repeated, whether truthfully or not, that the whole town had taken heart again for the time being. This is partly because of tales describing the wonderful state of order and prosperity obtaining in the British zone in the south, and partly (as I think) because of the general feeling of being neglected by their own Government, to say nothing of being abandoned and deserted by their own pusillanimous officials. I was careful in every quarter not to give any impression that I had come to criticise or spy on the Russians, whom I always spoke well of. Every reasonable person there admitted that the Soviet troops and officers behaved well, did not obtrude unduly on the life of the place, and paid for all supplies very much more promptly and generously than the Persian military ever did—testimonials which it is a pity the Soviet political officer clique manages so unnecessarily to offset. On all sides the hope was expressed that the British Government would send a vice-consul or other representative to stay at Rezaieh—a hope which I did not encourage. 19. The somewhat sombre picture of conditions drawn above might not be complete unless I added a note on the disquieting ravages which opium-smoking is causing, particularly in this part of Persia, although it is said to be bad enough in most of the others. Time after time one is told of the prevalence of opium smoking among all classes in the Rezaieh Province, but especially among officials and police in the towns, and even among the women. Persians themselves point to it as the real reason for their present low standard of courage, efficiency or moral principles, and their degeneration from the level of even a century or two ago, adding that the next generation produced from such drug-steeped stock will be even worse. The town of Maku is reported to be a particularly bad spot, where the middle-class residents no longer get any pleasure from smoking the drug, but now inject themselves with morphia or sniff cocaine—which they seem to procure with ease. European Governments have in some cases countered this menace, but it seems somewhat hopeless for the present type of Persian Administration to do so. I am told that an official position in the Economic Section of the Ministry of Finance which controls the sale and supply of opium is one of the most remunerative of all, because of the “ squeeze ” between the official price and the price which numberless addicts will pay.

Janmry 11 I HAVE the honour to report that since the beginning of the year Tabriz has passed through another period of anxiety, and comparative equanimi y as hardly yet been restored; some people are reported to be still leaving, and or none y return from their self-imposed exile of four months now m Tehran and elsewhere. More than one leading official here is or recently has been admitted y on the brink of throwing up the sponge, in spite of the extra income which every knows that most Government employees are making perhaps ev^ more rapaciously than before. It is indeed hard at times to decide which is the moie ingian e feature of the Persian middle-class character—plain cowardice or scarcely veiled dishonesty and corruption, and one is sometimes tempted pessimistically to think that the continuance of Persian rule in this outlying province depends at times on which is the stronger factor of the two. KarurlHP-h 2 For some weeks past there have been stories of unrest m the Karadag district, spiced with tales of Soviet intrigues among the tribesmen and to revolt—as if the Karadaghis had not always been among the foreinost to take advantage of any turmoil or weakness of proper government. On the 6th January, however/ stories came through from fugitives that a force of about 2,0(M) armed tribesmen had attacked and looted the frontier post at Julfa. while the Soviet authorities looked on indifferently, and that they were marching in force on Maraud where they had already summoned the gendarmerie post to surrender mdorto making an attack on Tabriz itself. Wild rumours began to circulate that Marand had been sacked and burnt, and that there were jio gendarmes available to resist the rebels. It was then that people here again talked of leaving for Tehran especially as it was said that the rebel leaders were Bolshevik agents, that the SovieTauthobties would do nothing to check them, and that the Persian authorities would, not venture to do so. . . ^ ^ i , 3 The next dav I called upon the newly arrived Soviet Consul-General to see what he thought of the situation. He admitted that the rebels at Julfa had professed Soviet sympathies and had declared they were taking over on behalf of a new Soviet republic in Persia, but stated that these pretensions had been cold shouldered by the Russian authorities on the frontier It seemed clear, however that the latter had not raised a finger to preserve order on what is their mJn Hne 5 communication with Tabriz. I protested to my Soviet colleague that surely his Government could not cooly watch armed rebel bands seizing towns •ind villages on the Julfa-Tabriz road and driving out the lawful police authoritief He must know that everyone in Tabriz accused Soviet policy of nlHncr and encouraging these disorders among the tribesmen and peasants. If inciting.a , w ? ere unwilling to take steps to restore order along this ad Tt iLsfhe should advise the Persian authorities here what to do, as I felt t'hev’wereToo ne vous to do anything which they feared might not please the Russians so near to the frontier. M. Koulagenkov had hardly been here long Russians so i f hi d me what obviously were the Soviet PolR!cal Bu™au^ answers, saying tha! those people who were accused of [27—84] PE Ft. 12 fomenting trouble in the villages were not Russians, but agents 'provocateurs in disguise, that the unrest was caused largely by greedy landlords going to extort money and produce from the peasantry, that the Persian authorities made trouble by persecuting those villagers who had been sympathetic or helpful to the Soviet forces of occupation (my despatch No. 56 of the 29th December last, paragraph 9, mentions the Persian version of this accusation), and that, if the local authont^^. really wished to put down disorder, they could easily do so. I again mentione^ however, their diffidence and timidity, and stressed what I termed our joint need for law and order in this important part of Persia, where British tanks and military supplies were due to pass shortly. I also took the opportunity of getting in a few digs at the Soviet Political Bureaus methods in this province, in flagrant contradiction with the policy enunciated by M. Stalin and the Soviet diplomats generally. To my surprise he admitted that the military (meaning doubtless the Politbureau or Ogpu in uniform, whose existence is never openly acknowledged as such) had undoubtedly made some mistakes here, but he himself hoped to put things right. 4. Later I saw various Persian officials, and, when they sounded me tor my opinion, told them to take strong measures. I learnt that the gendai mei ie commandant was away at Rezaieh or Ma ku, unable to return because of snow and bad roads, and that there were onI)T fifty gendarmes in reserve at Tabriz for sending against the rebels. Luckily these had just received arms from Tehran, after much delay. Actually some fifty gendarmes had already been sent to the threatened town of Marand, where the tribesmen were hanging about a few miles away. It later transpired that the latter were only about 300 in number, that a band of thirty or so had sufficed to seize the police barracks and customs-house at Julfa without any opposition being offered, and that only a few were armed with modern rifles, for which they had little ammunition. They were led by a refugee named Ismailoff, who was literate to the extent of being able to Avrite Turkish in Russian characters, and that was all. Before this second force of lift} gendarmes arrived, they had dispersed and returned to their villages, and the inference in Persian official circles is that the Soviet authorities merely told them to be off for the time being. They seized a few rifles and several thousand rials at Julfa, which have not been recovered. 5. I heard afterwards that the Soviet authorities here stressed their wish that the Persian gendarmerie should not use uncalled-for violence against the rebels. Such Communist tender-heartedness, strangely at variance with what is related of their own methods in the Caucasus, Turkestan and Sinkiang in the past, has its own meaning, of course, for the Persians. Although I try to deprecate stories of deliberate Soviet and Communist intrigue among the peasantry, I am now convinced that the Russians are, in fact, trying to make the country people at least sympathetic to them. Unfortunately, their ignorant and mass-propaganda fed agents or emissaries know of only one line of approach, the class-warfare one, and the results may soon be distinctly unpleasant unless some sensible corrective is administered by wiser Soviet counsels. But the unrepentant and persistent offenders of the Politbureau, as was shown in various parts of Asia, not to mention many parts of Europe, go their own irresponsible way, whatever the smooth foreign commissars may be saying to the contrary to foreign diplomats in Moscow, and so it is here. I have good reason to believe that this Soviet political clique in Tabriz definitely resent my presence here, as it seems to necessitate more subterfuge than would otherwise be used, and even an occasional stoppage of activities for a short while when some clumsy apprentice of theirs blunders too crassly. For some months now no Russian authority, civil or military, has visited this consulate, however often I may call to see them, although they cannot possibly accuse me of working against them in any way. Now that a Soviet Consul-General has been appointed here, speaking French and with a certain amount of knowledge of the world outside, relations may be a little less one-sided. . 6 I have mentioned in previous reports the manner m which Kurds swagger about carrying arms in Tabriz. Local opinion has averred for some time that these arms were supplied freely on the demand by the Soviet authorities, but I was loath to believe this, because the Russians always seemed so short of arms themselves and keen to pick up stray Persian army rifles. But I am assured on official authority that a few weeks ago a party of Kurds left here with a Russian lorry containing 100 rifles for the Sauj Bulagh district, and that the Soviet authorities sent word to the Persian gendarmerie along the route that they were not to be examined or interfered with. The Soviet Consul-General hasformally denied to me this story, but unfortunately spoilt the effect by adding that the Major Nabieff whom I had named as accompanying the consignment (I had done nothing of the sort and had never heard of the officer) could be proved never to have left barracks in Tabriz that day. I have learnt from a different and really reliable source that the Soviet political officers here actually presented new army pistol, complete with ammunition, as a mark of esteem to the -year-old son of a Kurdish chieftain whom I knew. One of the Soviet political officers I was talking to at a party last autumn about hunting and shooting in this part of the world confessed that he was of Kurdish origin (doubtless from the Erivan—Mount Ararat region), and I know he occasionally visits the Kurdish area near Sauj Bulagh, and also interviews Kurds in Tabriz. 7. As. I think I have said before, it may be that the Soviet forces still do not feel too sure of their Turkish neighbours and wish to use the Kurds against them if necessary. My Turkish colleague professes to have felt a certain coolness lately in the Russian attitude here towards him, but he is already so anti-Russian at heart that I attach no great importance to his feelings. Besides this, the Soviet authorities have openly told me that the Turkish Consulate is “ working ” very hard these days, leaving me to guess what at. I only know that my Turkish colleague has two vice-consuls and two Turkish secretaries, although his community is only about thirty all told, and mostly uncherished Armenians at that; yet he let out that he was asking for still another vice-consul from Angora to cope with the work. Whenever I see him his brain teems with scare- mongering stories of the bazaar type, which I realise have been fed to him by his hosts of Armenian spies and informers here. He says that the Russians are continually sending along stool-pigeons to him offering their services as Turkish spies, but that luckily he has means of knowing days beforehand that they are coming. He told an English traveller who visited him the other day that the Russians are killing off people in Tabriz almost daily, and that he is continually protesting to them officially, both of which statements are completely and flagrantly untrue, tie pretends to be a very deep and knowing servant of his country’s interests and professes great admiration for any particularly deceitful or machiavellian piece of work, yet if conversed with for long enough and worked up properly will betray himself'and his opinions in the most extraordinary way. Although he professes to me to be now pro-English, I am entirely convinced— and so is almost every European who meets him—'that he is a thorough German sympathiser and admirer of the Nazis. 8. In fact, I am sometimes inclined to wonder, although I have perhaps no right to do so, whether some of the unrest in this province is not being stirred up by the Turkish Consulates here and at Rezaieh, and that the Russians are more truthful than one might think in saying that agents 'provocateurs are working disguised as Russians. Any Armenian or Azerbaijani would do for the work, with a knowledge of the Turkish dialect spoken here and a little red in his buttonhole. The Persian rural police would not dare to arrest such an individual, and the Russians would learn about him too late. My Turkish colleague expresses the utmost scorn for the present Persian regime and says it has no right to govern this country. During an astonishing outburst the other day he told me : “ Mark my words, one day I shall be the Governor of this place, and then you will see what kind of administration they will get.” It is not the first time I have sensed this kind of idea, though never so baldly expressed. He has just been for a week’s visit to the new Turkish Ambassador in Tehran, and is in close touch with Angora. One might be tempted to wonder whether Turkey has really hopes of annexing Azerbaijan, unless my colleague was talking complete nonsense, and whether Germany has promised this province as a gift in case of a Nazi break-through to the Caucasus in the spring with Turkish connivance or assistance. 9. M. Ramazanoglou always seems to have a good repertory of the more malicious rumours floating round the bazaar here, the latest one being that, if the Russian forces should push the Nazis back to the German frontier, the British would then make terms with the enemy rather than allow Europe to be invaded by the Bolsheviks. This kind of talk, 1 of course, easily goes back to the Soviet authorities here via their Armenian toadies and informers, as it is no doubt meant to do. ... 10. There has been a little less “ democratic ” movement going on in Tabriz lately, partly perhaps because of the bitter cold in all meeting-places, and because quarrels have apparently broken out among some of the self-important and self- seekino- leaders. Their newspaper Azerbaijan no longer fulminates so loudly in4 x favour of Azerbaijan rights and independence, culture, language, justice, &amp;c. r but argues in favour of the poor and oppressed, against hoarding and the dangers of the continual increase in prices here. The other newspaper, Shahin, also cries out about the poverty rife here, the indifference of the rich, the scandal of the sugar rationing, the unbridled corruption in every branch of public life, with scurrilous attacks on the ex-Shah (including the princes and princesses) and 1^ dishonest and cruel administration, especially the gendarmerie. 11. One awkward question has been brought to light in the shape of a fund of 8 million rials raised a few years ago in Tabriz from a small tax on bread, and intended for the needs of the town and its poor. The money had somehow disappeared to Tehran, but such a noise has been made that the authorities there have promised to send it back, together with a grant of 4 million rials more for helping and finding work for the unemployed here. Unfortunately, even if these promises are fulfilled, no one expects any but a small percentage of the proper sums to reach their real end, so terrible is the peculation and corruption from top to bottom of the Administration. However, funds are to be advanced to factory owners to enable them to employ more weavers and spinners and leather workers, and there may be some left over for unspecified public works. One might have thought that the wealthy factory owners could have raised funds in the ordinary way through the National Bank of Persia if necessary, but no doubt the much-reviled Administration and officialdom wish to gain a little apprecia tion and applause in this manner, apart from the fact that the said owners show no such public spirit or sympathy with the unemployed whatever. At present their nerves are on edge with the thought that bolshevism may spread or is spreading here, that the Soviet intends gradually to undermine and then, in spite of all denials, take over this province of Persia, and that, in any case, there will be an appalling clash in the Caucasus in the coming spring from which everyone here, and especially themselves, will suffer. Disquieting stories are coming from Rezaieh regarding an incipient reign of terror caused by a so-called committee of Kurdish, Azerbaijan, Armenian and Assyrian roughs, led by an ex-chauffeur, whose idea is said to be to drive out the Tehran Administration and establish a workers’ and peasants’ soviet under Eussian auspices. There have been several murders both of officials, gendarmes and private citizens, and it is learnt that large numbers of middle-class residents, including Government officials, are leaving the town and district and coming to Tabriz because of their fear of the worsening situation there. I have, &amp;c. F. A. G. COOK. Enclosure 2. Sir R. Bullard to Consul Cook. (No. 263. Confidential.) Dear Cook, Tehran, February 5, 1942. YOUR despatch No. 1 of the 12th January, paragraphs 8 and 9. The Turkish Ambassador recently complained to me that the Turkish Consul at Rezaieh seemed to be alarmist and subject to something very like persecution mania, and for that and other reasons I was certain that he would not approve of the attitude which you attribute to the Turkish Consul in Tabriz. I therefore told him in confidence of the remark which M. Ramazanoglou made to you (middle of paragraph 8) and of his weakness for malicious rumours, the ambassador said he was greatly obliged, as it confirmed fears which he had already formed about M. Ramazanoglou. He said that he had recently written to him very stiffly, saying that it was impossible to come to any conclusion from the despatches from Tabriz what the situation was, the most alarmist reports being mixed up with the blandest optimism; and he showed me in confidence a telegram written in even stiffer terms which he had sent to Tabriz a few days before. The telegram instructed the consul to keep in mind the declared policy of the Turkish Government in regard to Persia and not on any account to indulge in any activity or to take any initiative in the affairs of the country, but to adhere faithfully to the role of impartial observer and reporter. I am sending copies of this letter to the Foreign Office and to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Angora and Kuibyshev. Yours sincerely, R. W.

Ow-o jtifgVLfYtdJC. Enclosure. Consul Cook to Sir R. Bullard. (No. 56. Confidential.) gj r Tabriz, December 29, 1941. ’ I HAVE the honour to report that the situation at Tabriz remains as before, quiet on the surface, but with a good deal of ferment underneath. Public opinion continues to be puzzled by the attitude of the Soviet authorities towards the Kurds, which is probably much less Machiavellian than it appears to be, but in that case gives unnecessary grounds for suspicion. The local discontented and politically-minded elements are now forming various “ parties, which distribute membership-cards to their adherents and hold semi-secret meetings in private houses to satisfy their innate Tabrizi passion for intrigue. The sense of most of them appears to be that Azerbaijan should be more democratic (a sop to the watchful Soviet political Cerberus?) and should be virtually separated from the decadent, tyrannical and unwanted Government of lehran. 2. In the countryside the situation is still uneasy, and the gendarmerie authorities are obviously nervous, although, in my opinion, much of the trouble is due to their own sense of inefficiency—&lt;and also to a knowledge of their own unpopularity. About a fortnight ago a handful of individuals under one Mohamed Agha collected arms in Tabriz itself, and set out for the Ahar district gathering lawless adherents as they went. Any gendarmes whom they encountered on the way apparently handed over their rifles tamely without opposition, but at last the party came to a large village where the ordinary inhabitants seized and disarmed them, tied their hands behind them and then asked the authorities in Tabriz what they should do with them. In the Maragha district the bandit Hussein Ghuli, whom I have previously mentioned, was able to extort a large sum of money from the people of Binab, while (according to the Russians) the force of gendarmerie sent to protect them fled at the first exchange of shots. Hussein and his band of about 100 men then advanced to near Azarshahr, only 35 miles from Tabriz, where nervousness began to spread in the bazaars. The gendarmerie thereupon went out in force to the attack, but the bandit got away, with the loss of only two or three men and a few horses. 3. I mentioned in a previous report that this Hussein Ghuli was in touch with the Russian garrison at Miandoab. and the Governor-General here now informs me confidentially that, when he asked certain important Kurdish chieftains in that area why they did not deal firmly with this (non-Kurdish) bandit, they replied that the Soviet political authorities had practically forbidden them to do so. At least six weeks ago General Novikoff told me he was going to round up Hussein Ghuli himself, but it seems that other ideas have prevailed. 4. Every day the streets of Tabriz see Kurds swaggering about in their tribal costumes (still theoretically illegal), armed with daggers, pistols and cartridge-belts, and sometimes carrying rifles or even tommy-guns. These they [26—35] :cd.poi CKeither picked up from the fleeing Persian armies in August, or have acquired 0 ) purchase in Tabriz itself under the eyes of the Persian authorities, who profess themseh^s unable to control them for fear of Soviet interference. 1 his attituc e probably arises also in part from a fear tiiat any Kurd challenged might, resist the police by shooting and that a Kurdish riot might then begin in the town, ihe Soviet authorities are undoubtedly to blame for this fear, whether it is justified or not. Anyone can see the hotel now used by the liussian military headquarters constantly visited by the turbaned Kurdish bravos, while the liussian irade Commissioner s office (certainly not restricted only to trade matters) has a constant stream of Kurdish visitors, it is estimated that the Russians have sold (01 m some cases given away) over 1200 tons of sugar to selected Kurds, some of whom have even resold it in Tabriz instead of taking it to their own areas, as doubtless intended. Of course, the Soviet answer is that they wish to keep the Kurds peaceful and contented, but it does not inspire much confidence among the non- Kurdish population here to see their method of doing so. While wishing to restrict the numbers and arms of the police and gendarmerie, they should not allow the blatant arming of the most lawless section of the Azerbaijan population, and certainly not permit individual Kurds to walk about armed in labriz, giving the obvious impression of being special Soviet proteges. 5. Although Tabriz is reasonably quiet, the middle-class, and especially some of the larger merchants, are still nervous of trouble. I learn that some of the latter have decided against the hoarding of goods nnd food-stuffs which was going on, not for moral reasons, but because they fear possible popular resentment before long and the sacking of their stores. The threatened reduction of the police force here by the Russians also has its effect, and it is said tnat the exodus of the better-off families to Tehran and other parts of Persia has now begun a^ain. There are a great many beggars on the Tabriz streets these days, and the authorities have opened a shelter for 250 of them; as in other countries, however, the intended inmates prefer soliciting aims in the cold, and it is seriously alleged that Russian political officers have been heard discussing their plight with these unfortunates and urging them to protest against it. Russian officers, in any case, visit local Persian factories, discuss conditions with the workers, photograph them, and in one instance got them to sign a joint statement about their joy at hearing of the Russian recapture of Rostov. 6. ° On the other hand, some employers are pleased with an agreement recently arrived at whereby local leather factories are to supply about 85 million rials 5 worth of leather to the Allied Governments, with hides and tanning materials to come from India. The deal was arranged by a M. Beloshapkin, of the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, and includes one factory at Meshed also. It is hoped later to obtain large orders for army boots, of which local workshops can if necessary produce nearly 2,000 pairs a day. There are talks said to be going on also with the Russians for the sale of wool, and possibly of army cloth, if technicians can be brought here to replace the Germans who fled in August. The number of unemployed in the town is beginning to cause concern even to the selfish employer and propertied classes here, and the Governor-General is taking counsel with them for alleviating the position, if possible, during the bitter winter months at least. 7. It is not that the “ proletariat ” here are Communist-minded so far, but the authorities fear that the demagogues (who are believed by most people to be aided and abetted by the Russians) will gradually work upon them to cause unrest and later revolt against the established order. One of the largest new “ parties 55 is called “ Tuda Azerbaijan,” tuda meaning people or populace, and its aim seems to be to interest the lower classes, who so far have never been touched by political ideas. Its newspaper, Azerbaijan, edited by a formerly down-at-heel ne ’ er _(io-well, who was known for years as a Bolshevist sympathiser, prints twdce-weekly cartoons of wretched peasants and farmers being beaten and bullied by hard-faced landlords, or drawings of rich capitalists cheating poor, ragged workers of a half-penny while handing out large banknotes to dancing-girls at a cabaret, and so on. The latest cartoon depicts a group of officials being driven out by a number of peasants and workers throwing brickbats and waving sticks. The party held a large meeting at the theatre this week to pass a resolution whereby the wide main thoroughfare of Tabriz had its name solemnly changed from ” Khiaban Pahlevi ” (after the ex-Shah who created it) to “ Khiaban Sattar(§) Khan’ for one section and “ Khiaban Bagher Khan for another, after two local Nationalist firebrands of the 1909 revolutionary days. Last week they held a meeting in a schoolroom at which Azerbaijan rights and lehran wror^gg were proclaimed, but the gathering then seems to have been taken over by some Kussian political officers, who made speeches (in local Turkish) about the war against the ^Fascists, and ended with the despatch of a congratulatory telegram to Moscow. 8. The present policy of the Governor-General and local authorities appeals to be to humour the malcontents to a certain extent, although this attitude is not altogether to the police liking. Moreover, the country landlords have been advised to abate their demands on the peasantry for the time being and, in cases where produce was stolen or disappeared during the autumn, to cut their losses rather than irritate the villagers further. This presumably means that the gendarmerie will not now be lent to landowners to collect forcibly their dues, as they have been during the last month or two—a mistaken policy, as 1 several times pointed out to the authorities, since the gendarmes were sure to behave in the same old merciless way to any villagers they found defenceless, and thus encourage armed resistance among the others. Three more cases are reported of gendarmerie posts being disarmed by peasant bands last week between fabriz and the Karadagh area. 9. Incidentally, the Soviet authorities also have been advising the gendar merie to treat the country-folk gently, since then they will have no trouble. The Governor-General’s rejoinder was to ask how the gendarmerie were to treat the lawless bands who surrounded and disarmed them, and whether they should not send extra forces to cope with them. Of course, any such Russian advice is immediately suspect to the Persian mind, particularly as Soviet officers are repeatedly said to be carrying on propaganda and other forms of interference among the rural inhabitants. An officer named Bagaroff (probably a Russo- Armenian) is reported to be very active in the Ardebil area. At Ardebil itself the Soviet military commandant is stated definitely to have demanded the release from prison of certain individuals who he said were being punished by the Persian authorities solely because they had shown themselves friendly to the Russians at the time of the occupation in August. The local authorities protested that, on the contrary, all had been sentenced after proper trial for various acts of violence, but in the end they had to give way and release the prisoners. Even in Tabriz the Soviet town-commandant visited the gaol in exactly the same sense, but was persuaded that his information was incorrect and no prisoners were taken out. 10. The sugar-rationing coupon scheme is getting under way after many upsets. The seething and fighting mobs round the coupon-issuing offices rivalled those round the sugar-selling shops before. Suddenly a large number of spurious coupons were discovered in circulation, a printer’s assistant having been unable to resist the temptation to print extra sheets and slip them under a door to a waiting accomplice. A black market in sugar-loaves at three or four times the official price is still flourishing, but illicit purchasers were sadly bitten one day recently when they arrived home to find that their cones, with genuine wrappers, were actually lumps of gypsum and cement. The bread situation is still very good, and about 5,000 tons of wheat have now been accumulated in the Tabriz silo. Although surpluses are reported from almost every district here, the Soviet authorities recently bought in 3,000 tons of wheat and flour and pressed the local authorities into buying it. Yet the various demagogues and trouble-makers in Tabriz are still fiercely resentful of any rumour that local wheat is going to Tehran or other parts of Persia, and even send unofficial deputations of busy- bodies to suspected areas to make sure that this is not happening. 11. Meanwhile, wheat is known to be slipping secretly in fair quantities over the frontier into Iraq, and perhaps to a less extent into Turkey. Locally- made matches are also being smuggled out by that way, and a shortage threatens. Until recently there were large stocks of German paper in this town, but these have now been heavily reduced—it is said by consignments to Hamadan and Kermanshah, where they were immediately bought up for despatch to Iraq, before the decree prohibiting such exports was hurriedly published. 12. The local authorities are at present saying that some form of popular demonstration with red banners is being staged for New Year's Day in Tabriz by the so-called democratic elements (with Russian connivance, it need hardly be ■h4 added). They profess to be worried lest what they term the “ Fascist sympar thisers may convert the demonstration into one against the Anglo-Kussian- Persian Treaty, which is expected to be signed on that day, and so lead to a clash of some kind in the streets. I am not inclined to take this foreboding too seriously, although it is quite possible that some of the self-important demagogues may have discussed such a meeting, but I intend to mention it deprecatingiy to tli^*v Soviet authorities beforehand in case some of their misguided junior political officers have been transgressing again in this direction.

Consul Cook to Sir R. Bullard. (No. 53. Confidential.) gi r Tabriz, December 14, 1941. I HAVE the honour to report that public order at Tabriz remains good, but that in Azerbaijan there continue to be incidents indicating unrest and a kind of resentment of lawful authority, possibly due to the period when there was for a time no gendarmerie or other sign of administration, and when junior Russian officers were telling the villagers that a new day had dawned, free of greedy landlords and oppressive Government taxation. At present the peasants in many places refuse to pay, or demur at paying, the octroi tax when they bring produce into any provincial town, refuse to give the landowners their share of the last harvest, and object to the presence of the new gendarmerie. At Sarab the latter sent a message to say that 2,000 peasants were gathering round the town and threatening trouble, but by chance two lorries full of Russian troops passed through on the way from Tabriz to Ardebil and this was enough to scatter them. At another village towards Ardebil the inhabitants are reported to have forcibly disarmed a party of five gendarmes. 2. As there are no Persian military forces in Azerbaijan, and as the Russian army of occupation has been much reduced, the Persian authorities were planning to increase their gendarmerie to about 4,000 men, but the Russians have now informed them that not more than 1,500 will be allowed. Colonel Basti tells me that the latter figure is barely enough for the province in normal times, allowing ten men to each rural post, and in disturbed times like the present is not sufficient to preserve order, let alone allow of a reserve to send quickly wherever needed. From Maragha comes a report that the bandit Hussein Ghuli, far from surrender- ing, is hovering round that town with a considerable following. If the Soviet forces were making a definite arrangement to keep order in Azerbaijan in every eventuality, one could understand their proposed limitation of the local gendarmerie, but this is by no means obvious, and, in fact, there are many Persians who think that, by their shadowy policy among the local peasantry generally, the Russians may be fomenting unrest and potential trouble for reasons of their own. 3. Similarly, the Soviet authorities here have told the Persian Governor of Tabriz that the city’s police force must be reduced from its present figure of 20 officers and 400 men to one of 12 officers and 205 men, at a moment when the Police Chief, Sarahang Saif, was asking Tehran to increase the force to about [26—30]2 900 men. He says that 200 policemen are not enough to keep order in a town of 220,000 inhabitants, especially in present conditions when unemployment is bad, prices high, food not too plentiful, demagogy rife and communist ideas not far below the surface. The robberies and pilferings so common in the autumn ha\e now been put down by a firm round-up of all suspicious characters and known criminals, but the Soviet Political Bureau are apparently complaining that these include a lot of their agents and friends, and complain therefore that the Persian police are working against them! Last week they demanded the immediate dis- J missal of Sarhang Saif, but the governor replied that he could not dismiss him without authority from Tehran. I am reliably informed that the night before last a party of four armed civilians held up a couple of policemen on duty in the outskirts of the city and took away their rifles. Tabriz itself is undoubtedly full of illicit arms, chiefly army rifles thrown away or hidden by the defending forces who broke up at the approach of the Russian column on the 26th August. The price of a rifle has now risen from 1,200 to 3.000 rials. It scarcely seems the moment to reduce the police force of the largest (and certainly potentially the rowdiest) provincial city of Persia to such a small number as 205. As the authori ties say, it takes 60 policemen on day and night reliefs to guard the prison alone. I fear that if the Soviet authorities enforce these unreasonable demands the Persian authorities, including the Governor-General, will decline responsibility for preserving public order, and the unpleasant experiences of last September, when the Russians refused to police the town themselves or to allow the local police to do so efficiently, will be repeated all over again, with knifings and pickpocketing in public in the daytime, and innumerable burglaries and citizens staying up sleepless at night. 4. During the absence from Tabriz of Major-General Novikoff and also of his assistant, Major-General Khrashchev, the Soviet Political Bureau, now under a certain Major Antonoff, seem to have been giving full rein to their ideas of how a temporarily-occupied province should be run. They made a descent on the printing office of the only respectable Tabriz newspaper, and also searched every room in the editor’s private house because he printed some German news bulletins received from the Pars Press Agency at Tehran. The journal (which wrote in favour of the present Government in Tehran and in the interests of law and order generally) is now suspended, while two other irrespon sible demagogic newspapers are free to print attacks on the present administra tion and a good deal of nonsense about the wrongs of the Azerbaijani populace and their historic rights to independence. The Persian authorities do not ven ture to curb them for fear of Russian resentment. The Soviet political officers also seized five British Movitone news-reels because one of them offended a junior officer’s sense of propriety by showing a scene in which Hitler saw off some troops to the front and received bouquets. The management of the cinema which showed such alleged Fascist propaganda was arrested and kept in prison for some days. I was not informed of the seizure of these British films, and when I suggested that I might see them projected to have an idea of the offending parts, was told that they had already been sent away from Tabriz. While the Russian Ogpu or Nkvd or Politruk, or whatever it likes to call itself, can furnish a pretext for its somewhat heavy-handed goings on, it hardly seems necessary to ransack a private house in order to stop news bulletins in a small newspaper, or to seize five films and clap two or three surprised individuals into gaol for a week because one film was slightly displeasing, and it seems clear that this is a Soviet method of cowing any independent attitude and probably of encouraging or clearing the way for their own local creatures. But it arouses much resentment and misgiving among the better-class Persians, official and non-official, and aids the present Gevman radio campaign against the signing of the treaty. They point out that the only news paper which was supporting the Tehran Government is stopped, while abusive anti-Government and irresponsible journals can continue—and ask why the Soviet political officers are doing the Nazis’ work for them here. 5. I have mentioned before the publication here by the Soviet authorities of a newspaper in Azerbaijani Turkish called Vatari; of course they did not comply at all with the Persian press laws or even consult the local authorities, but in any case explained that the newspaper was for “ their own people,” whoever these may be. But now I am tdd that local Persian school-teachers are being circu larised to subscribe to this paper (which merely by being in Turkish runs counter to the official educational policy, to say nothiiig of its communist contents), and3 junior Russian officers are bursting informally into schools urging subscrip tions, and then advising the teaching of Azerbaijani Turkish instead of the Persian language. These officers are probably of Russian Azerbaijan or of Armenian race, and in spite of all the pronouncements of higher policy and promises of non-interference are undoubtedly imbued with the idea of joining Russian and Persian Azerbaijan into one cultural, and later one political, unit. If I mildly protest to the head of the Soviet forces of occupation (a purely military ^.personage, or apparently so) he can always disown these junior officers of another branch as exceeding their duties, or deny any knowledge of their particular activites. They will probably be curbed however for a short time, I have found, and then begin again with what after all is their job and their reason for existence. As the number of combatant troops here grows less, the preponderance of these political agents in uniform makes itself more evident, and really one is obliged to wonder what they all do here. Their latest achievement was the staging of a “ Moscow Concert ” in an occupied schoolroom, a harmless third-rate entertain ment of the barn-storming type with conjurors, recitations, comic songs and the like. One of the performers (a so-called eccentric dancer) was a Scotsman named Campbell who has taken Soviet citizenship and State employment under the name of Karlin. 6. The party of Kurds who were taken on a cultural trip to Baku returned after about ten days. Two of the chieftains came to lunch with me one day before leaving for Sauj Bulagh, but showed no great enthusiasm for the wonders they had carefully been shown. What seemed to impress them was the fervour and well-guided mentality of the school children whom they were allowed to question. It is said that the Russians are now organising another free trip to Baku, for the ordinary residents of Tabriz who may wish to go. 7. Sugar is now distributed in Tabriz by ration cards at the rate of 1,200 grammes per month, under the control of the Persian authorities, to whom the Russians sell 6 tons per day. The Soviet organisation no longer deals with private merchants in Tabriz, but sells large amounts to individuals in the provinces without any reference to the Persian authorities. The later have asked for details, so as to organise fair distribution in provincial centres and prevent hoarding (or so they pretend), but with no success. They hint that Russian distribution goes by favour, and is useful as a means of propaganda or persuasion, as what costs them about 3 rials per kilog. can be and is given away, and then sold at 35 or even 50 rials in some towns by their proteges. Two respectable Kurdish acquaintances of mine from Mahabad were refused sugar by the Russian Trade Commissioner here because he said he had none available. When I heard that another merchant in that district had had 9 tons that same day, I tackled M. Agaronoff and he immediately agreed to let them have 2 tons each. 8. During the last fortnight it has been very difficult to interview Russian staff officers of any section, as all were away day after day on “ exercises,” even in the bitterest frost and snow. Shortly before this there were continual blasting explosions for several days a mile or two outside Tabriz, and it may be that some scheme of local defence is being drawn up or practised. 9. It is curious to see that the Tehran press continues to print regularly obviously officially-inspired paragraphs about the Tehran-Tabriz railway line. They promise that rails will be laid as far as Mianeh by the end of this month, and yet it is clear to the most ignorant and untechnical traveller by road that the rails cannot even enter the Kuflan Kuh Gorge, miles south of Mianeh, for many months, as there is an enormous bridge hardly begun as yet, to say nothing of tunnels still hardly pierced in the mountain side. 10. As a change from former conditions, as recently as this summer, when only the Germans could distribute propaganda in this district, over 6 cwt. of British propaganda of a score of varieties in Persian, English and French have been distributed in Tabriz by this consulate during the last fortnight. Letters of thanks have actually been received, and the consular staff repeatedly asked for more. This does not mean, however, that the educated classes have suddenly switched over to our side, as there have been some very long faces in the cafes this last fortnight at the distressing news of the German retreat from Rostov and gloom at the Nazi failure to reach the Caucasus this winter is confidently expected. 11. The Governor-General informs me that the police and gendarmerie have now received their increased pay for the last month. There is a story currentthat some of them (and other Government officials here) have said that as salaries have been raised to meet the higher cost of living, naturally the usual bribes, presents and other perquisites will have to be increased in proportion. Nobody appears to know where the money will come from for these increases in the present stagnant and uncertain condition of the country, and when I questioned the local Director of Finance about it the other day he seemed to treat it as a rueful kind of joke.

The soothing and in parts misleading article published by the Minister of the Interior in the Tehran press on his return from this province probably shows his disquiet, while the Governor-General and the chief of gendarmerie have been absent together for over a week in the capital at a time when the local situation is certainly no easier. 2. Possibly the attention given to the Azerbaijanis and their problems in the Tehran and Istanbul press, after years of neglect and oppression, has helped to fan their smouldering grievances. It is dilficult to describe any political movement as yet, but there are undoubtedly private meetings and discussions, threats are known to be uttered against the Tehran officials here, whom nobody imagines to be much changed from the corrupt and inefficient gang they were before (with the possible exception of the chief of police), stories of Turcophile parties are heard, accusations of Bolshevik machinations are put forward, Armenian intrigues are blamed and dire vengeance foretold. Over all hangs the question of how long the new and unloved Shah will last, and even more how long before the all-powerful German armies will arrive—with or without Turkish compliance or assistance—in the Caucasus and so bring better order here. 3. There are still minor incidents in the countryside, but it is difficult to know their seriousness or extent, since both Soviet and Persian authorities when questioned flatly deny them—unless they reflect wholly on the other party. The bandit Husseni Ghuli has not come in for pardon, as foretold to me by the Governor-General over a fortnight ago; the Russian general hinted to me then that his forces were shortly going to deal decisively with the man, but I am confidentially informed that he was parleying with Soviet officers in Miandoab one day last week. At Ahar, on the road to Ardebil, the newly-installed gendarmerie had their rifles taken away by a party of hectoring Russian officers (who spoke Azerbaijan Turkish), but when I spoke to General Novikoff about this apparent disregard of the agreement signed only recently in Tehran he vigorously denied the possibility of the affair, and I am left to surmise that it must have been Russo-Armenian officers acting without the knowledge cr authority of their superiors, or else Persian adventurers in search of rifles and wearing Russian uniforms. A fight was repoted ten days ago at the entrance to Tabriz between Armenian peasants and the gendarmes collecting taxes, in which [25 29]-— ENCLOSE IN WEEKLY LETTER RECd.POL. ” * Pt.| No. 6 7 FEE 1942 31 JAN 942 ; FROM SECRETARY, EXTERNAL DEPT., INDIA OFFICE INDIA OFFICE2 two peasants were reported killed. Last week an affray was said to have occurred in a village near Mianeh, where the villagers refused to surrender the usual quota of wheat and produce to the landowner and gendarmes accompanying him. Whatever the denials, the fact remains that the local prison is full, and almost every time I go out I see wretched and ragged wights being hauled to gaol by ihe ^^ police. As I surmised in my last report, the greedy landowner ‘ arbabs, who were the first to run away and hide in terror in August, are now returning when they hear that Persian gendarmerie have restored order in a district. A suitable bribe to the right official and they are given an escort of armed police to re-enter their villages, frighten their miserable tenants and exact even more than in former years. When J spoke of this to a leading official, he replied : What do you expect ? In spite of all promises, the police and gendarmerie are still receiving the same miserable salary as before—6 to 8 tomans (about 10s.) a month, on which to keep a wife and family, and as the official incre ment is not forthcoming they have to make a living wage in the same way as before.” As I have told some leading Persians, there is little point in their complaining to me of insidious Bolshevik propaganda among the people, while some of them foment hatred and social unrest in this manner, just as their unprincipled merchants, by hoarding and profiteering in staple commodities, create bad feeling in the towns. But there is, of course, another side to the story, in that the inhabitants of certain villages are ready to refuse to give their dues either to the landowner or to the representatives of the Government itself, and, in fact, have in some places written bold letters to the Governor-General to say so, threatening armed resistance to any attempt to collect grain quotas or taxes. In some cases it is alleged that junior Russian officers have encouraged the attitude of revolt. The provincial Government’s task is therefore not an easy one. 4. I have already reported stories of Russian intrigues among the Kurds of Azerbaijan. Recently more parties of such Kurds, somewhat deliberately flaunting their tribal costumes, have been entertained in Tabriz by Soviet political officers, taken to cinemas and theatres and shown Russian troops in barracks. The leading cicerones are two Soviet officers named Alieff and Mirosknoff, both obviously Moslems from Russian Azerbaijan. I have it on reliable authority that about nine Kurdish chieftains in the Saqqiz-Sauj Bulagh area had arranged to meet British officers a week ago at Bukan; someone told the Soviet Political Bureau, who immediately sent their officers to collect the chieftains, including two who had arrived early in Bukan. The Kurds were practically bundled into cars under a show of Soviet kindness and hospitality, and taken to Tabriz. Two were acquaintances of mine and tried to get into touch with me, feeling uncom fortable in such unwonted Communist intimacy, but were unable to do so. Within a day or two they were whisked off for a week’s trip to see the wonders of Baku, and have not yet returned. In the old days the imperialist Russians used to try and cultivate the Kurds in the hope of support in case of need in Azerbaijan, but it is hard to see what hopes the Communist ideologists can have of such a completely individualist, fanatically tribal and bigotedlv religious race of men. I rallied the Russian Acting G.O.C. mildly on this subject, and he replied stolidly that if the Soviet officers were moving among the Kurds (for once I was not met with a denial) it was solely in the interests of general law and order. Later on I learnt that the Russians had also taken some of the chiefs of the well- known Shahsavan tribe to Eastern Azerbaijan on the cultural visit to Baku. They must be very proud of something or other there, as a fortnight ago they collected a so-called representative group of eight Tabriz citizens, including a doctor, a journalist, a musician, and engineer and so on, and took them to Baku, whence they have only just returned. They even invited Government officials without consulting the Governor-General first, although they afterwards rectified this slip. 5. A few days ago the Turkish Consul-General told me that some of his community had learnt that they were marked down for death by gunmen hired by the local Soviet Political Bureau or Ogpu, and he was very nervous of the effect that such political murders would have on Turkish opinion. Although I saw the point, I did not altogether believe his fears, but only a few hours afterwards one of the victims was, in fact, found shot dead with six bullets in the street outside his house. This was a certain Yusef Ali Bey, a man aged 65, who had been a notable at Baku before 1917 and had fled from the Bolsheviks and lived for twenty years in Turkey and Persia. My Turkish colleague came to see me next day and was most apprehensive of what might happen in Angora if the further3 murders which he anticipated took place. Already he was being accused, he stated, of being too lenient towards the Russians in his reports, and even this one assassination would create a painful feeling. 6. Although I did not necessarily believe his statement that the shooting was definitely the work of the Ogpu, I knew that German agents in Angora were ^doing their best to spread atrocity stories against the Soviet authorities in Azerbaijan, and decided that, in case there were the slightest truth in the story, I had better speak to the Russian military commander. As Major-General Novikoff was away in Tiflis. I saw Major-General Khrashcheff and mentioned the danger of any imprudent activities on the part of the Soviet political officers here, as I had already done both in September and October when I noticed signs of undesirable zeal iii that direction. I could not tell whether he already knew of the alleged political murder, but he received my remarks very fairly and said that it must be the work of agents provocateurs, adding that all his staff were animated only by their strict orders to avoid interference in internal affairs in Persia, to respect local feelings, and so on. 7. Of course, I accepted his comments, but personally I cannot persuade myself that the Ogpu is as harmless here as all that. In previous reports I have described their somewhat ridiculous goings-on, and at the theatre on the Soviet anniversary of the 7th November I had the opportunity of seeing the heads of the Politruk lined up on the stage, firing off speeches one after another, and a more sinister-looking lot it would take a William le Queux to describe. The most sinister is a Colonel Yarkoff, who appeared only about a month ago, and since then I have sensed a growing influence of this unhealthy political side over the whole Soviet staff and garrison. I feel that perhaps Major-General Novikcff is strong enough to resist it, but unfortunately he is often away (or ill), and Colonel Yarkoff has plenty of scope with the rest. I suspect that it was he who hindered the British official war correspondents early in the month from doing any useful reporting or photographing here at Tabriz, and he who has lately hindered Major Proctor, our liaison officer, from establishing any contacts with Soviet officers under the rank of a major-general, which is absurd. 8. Persians often say to me in a shocked tone how much propaganda the Russians are doing, but they never seem to be able to give any precise details. However, this week appeared what everyone admitted a magnificent propa ganda documentary film, dealing with life in Soviet Armenia. Some local Armenians have, of course, expressed a desire to go to the U.S.S.R. (at the time when tables were set in the street at one place for signatures), but I hear that the Soviet authorities have so far shown no hurry to accommodate them after all. I continue to hear of nervousness among many Armenians, who fear dire conse quences if the Russian military forces suddenly leave Persia and leave them to the mercy of the local Moslems. The Turkish Consul-General professes to me to be in a fix over this problem, as most of his Turkish subjects here are Armenians who would rush to his consulate at the first sign of trouble or impending- massacre, and he fears that the premises would be attacked by a murderous mob. His fears may be a little exaggerated, but are by no means groundless, as in the last war the local population did attack and massacre Armenians in the consulates in Tabriz—and probably would do so again. This applies equally to the British Consulate, which has no defences at all and is on the edge of the Armenian quarter. If the Russian troops should suddenly leave, the local police, as I have already reported, and as the chief of police himself confidentially admits, would be quite incapable of preserving public order, and it is to be hoped, therefore, that from a general standpoint some British troops could be sent here in time before the Soviet forces moved out. The alternative would most probably be massacres for a day or a couple of days, and then a Turkish military invasion of Western Azerbaijan, possibly as far as Tabriz with armoured cars, which could reach here in about nine hours from the frontier. 9. I learn that this season the sugar output at the Miandoab factory has amounted to only 1,135 tons instead of the normal production of 5,000 tons, which is a set-back to all in this district. As I wrote before, the Kurdish cultivators of sugar-beet were either so busy looting that they did not worry to lift the crop, or else they knew that transport was so scarce that they gave their beet to their cattle to eat. Only 7,000 tons of beet reached the factory instead of about 30,000 needed.4 10. The Governor of Tabriz tells me that the Russian military authorities here have received orders from the Soviet Embassy in Tehran to release the 200 Persian officers shut up since last August, but that they decline for no given reason to carry them out. This consulate is continually approached by pathetic groups of wives and children to obtain the release of these officers, who are-^-v undoubtedly in bad and unsuitable quarters, are not permitted to receive food from their families and not now allowed to visit the local baths, since some junior officers escaped while doing so. 11. The Russian military authorities continue to occupy two of the four telegraph lines between Tabriz and Tehran, although obviously they can have little cause these days for doing so. Yet when I flew to Tehran last week they sent four telegrams about me by the Persian telegraph office instead of by their own (incidentally sending the cost afterwards to the consulate), and I am reliably informed that whenever General Novikoff himself wishes to telegraph to Tehran he uses the non-military wires. It took six days for a wire from this consulate to reach Moscow in September by military line, and nearly a fortnight for the reply to get here, marked “ Immediate, re-repeated.” 12. Among the goods at the Tabriz custom-house seized by the Russian authorities in September as being German property were twenty-six Swedish radio sets addressed to an Iraqi firm in Tehran. Although I have been trying continually to obtain the return of these goods since then, and orders have been given to that effect, no results have been achieved, and the local Russian Trade Commissioner admits that neither he nor anyone else knows where the wrongly- seized packages are. Similarly, nothing has been heard of the lorry seized from a British subject by the Red Army in August last. I have, &amp;c. F. A. G COOK.* r i L.^.

(No Sir, AX O )%&lt;- ie&gt;. Consul Cook to Sir R. Bullard. 48. Confidential.) Tabriz, November 17, 1941. I HAVE the honour to inform you that nothing of importance has occurred at Tabriz during the past week, except perhaps the local elections which were well-known to be completely “ rigged ” and caused little or no excitement when it was seen that the authorities did not intend to allow any new-fangled notions of freedom or “ democratic ” movements to have their way. 2. Exactly the same seven Deputies as before were elected for' Tabriz, in spite of the hopes of the demagogues, who accused the authorities of obtaining votes by gifts of sugar (a precious article here these days). The Armenian community says that it had a candidate brought down to Tabriz from the capital by the Minister of the Interior, a companion of his in the ex-Shah’s political prison until recently, and naturally they had to vote unanimously for him. As soon as the Minister had left here for Rezaieh, however, on his tour of inspection, an urgent telegram arrived from Tehran saying that on no account was this protege of General Jahanbani’s to be elected. The electors who had already cast their votes were nonplussed, but the Governor-General is reported to have said : “ Give me the boxes and leave it to me/’ Hence the same representatives as before. 3. The pan-Turk articles of M. Yalchin in the Yeni Sabah newspaper at Istanbul caused some stir here, as might have been expected. The Minister of the Interior was at the time in Rezaieh, the most potentially interested area, and was somewhat short with the Turkish Consul-General here on his way back to Tehran. While the newspapers in the capital had only one retort to make to the exaggerated Turkish pretensions, the local journals took advantage of the incident to say that Azerbaijan had its own local feelings in the matter and relied wholly neither on Angora nor Tehran, both of whom were mistaken in considering this province as their natural perquisite to bandy about without a thought for the freedom and morale of its inhabitants. The Turks were told firmly, however, that the existence of a Turkish dialect here had nothing to do with nationality or sentiment; one may well imagine that their campaign (signs of which I have reported to you for some time) risked offending their Persian neighbours in order to give a warning to the Russian usurpers, in case the latter are thinking of staying here indefinitely. 4. General Jahanbani passed through Tabriz very quickly on his return to Tehran from a tour of Azerbaijan, and 1 was unable to see him again. He seems to have found conditions reasonably normal at Khoi, Maku and Rezaieh, where gendarmerie centres are now being re-established, but it is given out that at Sanj Bulagh. the only Kurdish town on this route, he voluntarily dismissed his official police and gendarme escort and stayed a night under the protection of his Kurdish hosts—a gesture likely to appeal to them. The Russian general tells me a very different story however, declaring that General Jahanbani was offered a [25—11]2 Russian escort at Rezaieh for his journey through the Kurdish area, but declined it as unnecessary, saying he knew his Kurds. When he arrived near Sanj Bulagh the said Kurds stopped his convoy, disarmed his police escort and made the Minister take off his general’s uniform. He stayed the night in borrowed civilian clothes and left next day, his escort receiving their rifles again when outside the town on the way back to Tabriz. The Kurdish notables responsible are the same who showed me every courtesy and arranged a large lunch when I suddenly visited Sanj Bulagh a fortnight before. Thft colonel of gendarmerie here has admitted to me that the leading inhabitants in that region have told the Tkt, KuHrici+J* oau. rv&lt;vo M-v fk. ^ fWfc. . authorities that if the gendarmerie is to return it must be composed of Kurds, and it is probable that this demand will have to be met in part, although clearly the officers will need careful selection. 5. The brigand Hussein Guli (mentioned in my despa tch No. 41) has agreed to submit and come into Tabriz in returnfor a free pardon from the Governor- General. after another lawless character named Jamshid, in the Maragha district, had been semi-officially authorised to go out and attack him. Both Oi these robber-band leaders, as I understand from the colonel of gendarmerie, were animated and supported not only by greed and plunder but also by the local rivalry and animosities of otherwise respectable landowners and country notables who used them for paying off old scores. One village headman was discovered to be officially collecting rifles and then transferring them to his favourite bandits in the neighbourhood. 6. Last week a lorry carrying four persons was held up on the main Tehran-Tabriz road near Mianeh and the passengers robbed of everything, including most of their clothes. The local gaol is at present packed with peasants brought in by gendarmes on minor charges of disorder and resistance to authority, but the Governor-General says he is treating them leniently and letting thein go. I rather suspect that some of the greedy landowners are now taking it out ” on their villagers for their independent behaviour and pilfering of stocks at the time of the Russian occupation, now that the gendarmerie are recovering control. 7. Although I know there are large supplies of sugar in Tabriz, hoarding and faulty distribution still cause a continual shortage. One day last week su^ar-loaves were being hawked in the streets at 38 rials, instead of the normal price of 10^ rials. As the Russians do not sell sugar in loaves, it is obvious that these came from speculators who bought them up some weeks ago from the Persian monopoly, and were now' making a profit of nearly 300 per cent, on their outlay. I spoke bitterly to the Governor-General on this subject, telling him also that I had it from reliable sources that by paying 1,300 rials instead of the proper price of 700 rials to certain officials in the municipality it was possible for anyone to obtain a sack of sugar from the Sugar Commission, and warned him of growing popular resentment. Next day he ordered the police to seize all sugar being sold at profiteering prices, and by tracing back supplies found one merchant in possession of 198 sacks of sugar which were supposed to have been bought for the town of Maragha weeks ago. He also sealed up the store of the Sugar Commission, to prevent the unauthorised selling and bribery which I had mentioned, and asked me to suggest more general distribution of sugar to local shops by the Russians. I have already suggested this to Major-General Novikoff, and conditions were better for about a week, after which the few favoured distributors chosen by M. Agaronoff, the Russian Trade Commissioner, again recovered their control. 8. The Russians continue to bring in goods of many kinds without paying duty, although they insist on cash payment from their buyers m the bazaar and so are not short of rial funds. According to the local Director of Customs they do not furnish any lists of their imports, and do not even pay normal warehousing charges for the sheds they have taken over in the customs. In addition to the goods previously mentioned, they are now bringing in chemicals and drums of kerosene and oil fuel, which they sell at the same prices as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s properly taxed fuel. Yet they have so far made no apparent effort to carry out their'undertaking to supply the A.I.O.C. depot at Resht with about 700 tons of petrol and kerosene in replacement of the stocks they commandeered in Azerbaijan in the first weeks of the occupation. 9. There are persistent rumours that good business is being negotiated by I the local leather factories with the Soviet authorities, and sales are expected very shortly, particularly of pickled hides from one factory owned by Wahabzadeh.3 A sudden revival of the carpet exporting trade is announced, and about 120 bales left here last week, chiefly for Iraq and Turkey. It is said that the Persian Government are helping these exports, in order to stimulate employment in the carpet-weaving industry here. 10. Transport is still sadly scarce in this province, and I gather that the Governor-General has given up hope of recovering the Persian lorries and cars seized and carried off by the Red Army when it marched in in August, and is now demanding compensation instead—with little hope of success, I fear, unless we British are quixotic and misguided enough to foot the bill. Wheat and sugar-beet are being handled by the ten lorries kept back last month by the Governor-General from the Tehran convoy (although the Minister of War is apparently still bewailing to the British Military Attache their alleged retention by the Red Army), yet many more trucks are still required. At Bustanabad, only about 40 miles from Tabriz, the village wheat-stores are choked with 5,000 tons of grain which cannot be moved except with camels and donkeys. During his visit to Tabriz the Minister of the Interior was asked by one of the leading citizens, among other petitions, not to countenance the sending of Azerbaijan wheat to Tehran and other parts of Persia, as this would cause local resentment. If, however, the local Government silo could be filled—it holds about 16,000 tons opinion might be less resentful of export. At present the silo contains 5,000 tons, and about 100 tons arrive daily. A good deal of grain is lying in the open in the villages for lack of transport, and we have already had two falls of snow in this region. The Governor-General is thinking of asking the Soviet forces for the loan of some of their fleet of light trucks for a few days, merely to collect wheat, but it is very doubtful if this request will be granted, as a great number of the Red Army’s vehicles have recently returned to Russia. Some light trucks should be sent from Tehran in place of the few heavy diesel lorries now being used, and would be handier for reaching remote villages on narrow winding country roads. 11. Politically the town is comparatively quiet, after the eclipse of the noisy demagogues last week. But there is a good deal of abuse of the Majlis, the Tehran Government and of Mr. Firoughi in particular going on, largely due to the vulgar tirades of Sharukh nightly in Persian from Berlin, which appeal particularly well to the inveterate Frondeur instincts of the Tabrizi. 12. A party of three British officers and ten Indian soldiers arrived here unexpectedly from Iraq during the week, saying that they had been instructed to carry out an engineering reconnaissance of the roads and bridges around Lake Urmia and up to the Russian frontier at Julfa. Major-General Novikoff was courteous but firm in his refusal to allow such a reconnaissance to be carried out in the Russian-occupied zone, as he said that at his conference with General Waved at Tehran in September it had been agreed that due notification should be given of any such visits of one army into the territory of the other. The party stayed here 'three days and then returned to Mosul. 1 have, &amp;c. F. A. G. COOK.EZTEHHA1 SECRET, xEolitical Department. NOTES FOR REGISTRY. REGISTER NO. Ext. 8121/41. Ext. 8122/41.

The police and the Amnieh were being re-organized, but when atthe end of October there was a rumour that the Russian troops might be withdrawn, the Persian civil and police authorities became seriously alarmed, fearing an outbreak of disorder. The rumour proved groundless, however. Though the Russian authorities still refrained from active propaganda, concerts were being given and films shown, all of which lauded the Soviet regime, and the soldiers themselves who mixed with the local population were all potential propagandists.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a report by His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz respecting the internal situation in Tabriz. Tehran, November 12, 1941. Q • . 4- -r Enclosure. Consul Cook to Sir R. Bullard. (No. 47. Confidential.) Sir, Tabriz, November 9, 1941. I HAVE the honour to inform you that the present situation in Tabriz remains reasonably calm, although during the past week there has been a certain amount of agitated feeling in various quarters for different reasons. 2. When I saw the Governor-General at the beginning of this week, he again mentioned his fear of some kind of ‘ £ democratic ’' demonstration on the coming Friday, the anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, and asked me again to mention the subject to the Russian authorities. I assured him that I had every reason to believe that the Soviet authorities here would not encourage or even permit the kind of turbulence he feared, but it was obvious from our conversation that he suspected the Russians of intriguing with the local demagogues whose names I have previously mentioned, and he even told me the names of the Soviet military officers (either staff or political bureau) with whom they have meetings and conversations. To this I replied that it was equally possible that Agarzadeh and his friends had been taking the initiative with the Russians to give themselves some semblance of support, just as a few weeks ago they had made indirect overtures to this consulate—without meeting with any particular response. 3. On the next day the chief of police visited me, ostensibly to pay a call, but I suspect to sound me on the subject of possible disorder. He, too, raised the subject of Russian connivance in the local “democratic” movement, and wondered how best to deal with it. I was able to assure him in turn that the Soviet authorities would not countenance disorder this week, and that it was for him and his police officers under him to take all suitable measures to secure public order if necessary. 4. As Major-General Novikoff was still away from Tabriz, I did not think it necessary to mention the subject to any other quarter, until I became aware on Thursday of the most persistent rumours and alarming forecasts of riots and rebellion in the town. The Turkish Consul-General came to see me at midday in an undisguised state of extreme anxiety, saying that he and everyone he knew felt sure of trouble next day, that the Armenians were being incited by the Russians, and that he was going to ask the police for three rifles with ammunition that evening in order to defend the consulate if needs be. I tried to allay his fears, saying that I knew that the local police would deal with any outbreak immediately; this seemed to depress him all the more, as he admitted that the chief of police had just informed him half an hour ago that his constables had been ordered to shoot without hesitation if the situation demanded it. Early in the evening my Persian clerk came in to say that the whole town was seething [24—53] REC*. POt- f ?9,UEC 911 INDIA OFFICE2 with anxiety, and with stories that the villagers all round Tabriz weie coming into town next day under Soviet auspices, uniting with the mob here an going to riot. Shortly afterwards Dr. Lamme, of the American Mission Hospital rang up the American Military Attache, who was staying with me, and repeated tne story, saying how frightened the Armenian Christians were. 0 5 Although I still felt sure that the agitation was quite unwarranted 1 decided to visit the Russian Chief of Staff that evening and mention the state of the town. This I was able to do among a number of othei topics o „ con versa tion, and learnt that (ni) local Russian Headquarters had no feai o (isoicci next day, expressing mv own confidence that none would be allowed by tnem. 6. Next day it was obvious that the police had taken every precaution iiom dawn onwards to forestall trouble, and none occurred. Major-General JNovikott had returned to Tabriz, and in the morning gave a simple reception, which was attended by all the leading Persian officials. The military parade ongma) fixed for the anniversary had been cancelled. The Governor-General told me that a public meeting advertised by the “ democrat ' leaders had not taken place, an that a well-known firebrand had just arrived in Tabriz from Tehran (where he had been officially exiled for some time), but had advised the local committee against action liable to embarrass the local authorities at present, much to everyone’s surprise. On top of this, several copies of a Shiraz newspaper advocating calm and constitutionalism had been received here, and had quickly been distributed by the governorate in democratic circles. Agarzadeh saw the wind taken painfully from his sails, and in the afternoon went around the town in a carriage, announcing a public meeting at which he, as the people s lea ei and benefactor, would explain the present situation, ^o sooner had he reached the venue and began to speak than he was quietly hustled into a car and taken away—to the surprise of most people—by the Russian authorities. *7 At the moment of writing T have not heard of local reactions to this. Local’officials seemed so sure that the Soviet were behind the “ democratic unrest yet in a conversation I had a week ago with the Russian I raoe Commis sioner he was equally insistent that the Turkish Consul-General here and his agents were egging oil the demagogues, to cause trouble for Russian and Persian authorities alike. In just the same way I hear conflicting reports from Western Azerbaijan about the Kurdish situation on the frontier. My Turkish colleague has told me outright that he knows that the Russians are arming the Kurds with rifles and even machine guns, and are intriguing continually with the tribal leaders He said that the Soviet authorities about ten days ago invited a number of these Kurdish headmen even to Tabriz, and provided them one evening with a box at the local theatre in full view of the Persian authorities. M. Ramazanaglan declares moreover, that our allies have invited the notorious Sultan Mahmoud to come over from Iraq and join in their sinister policy, whatever it is. I cannot ' help feeling that the Turks are working themselves up into a greater mistrust fulness of °the Russians here, and from what my colleague has told me about middle-class feeling in Erzerum (whence his vice-consul returned not long ago), the German propaganda svstem is having some success there. People are saying that it was a great mistake to allow the Soviet to come south along the Turkish border into Azerbaijan, and that Turkey should have taken some kind of action in August to prevent it. . 8 There may be also the Armenian question to complicate matters. A Persian police official tells me that the Kurds and Armenians in North-West Azerbaijan are combining, presumably against the Shah’s Government. This is not logical in view of the well-known religious fanaticism of the Kurds, but, of course 8 it is a trick which has been played by nationalist-minded Kurdish leaders before’ notoriously Sheikh ObeidullalTin his rebellion of 1880-81, and generally against the Turkish suzerainty. Certainly any story of Armenian truculence m tffis part of the world appears particularly to upset the Turkish authorities, as any conversation with my colleague shows (and he is, of course, imclose touch with his Government now, and with their consulate in Rezaieh). Nothing would convince him that the Armenians are not being used by the Soviet m this province, and he has said several times that if the Armenians cause trouble with the Moslems here (meaning the Turcophone or what he calls the Turkish population), his Government will be bound to intervene. As the Armenian minority is not likely to seek trouble on its own, this can only be construed as a warning to the Russians who are suspect of backing them. ——3 9. On the other hand, M. Agoronoff, in a conversation last week with me, said that the situation in Azerbaijan was not at all reassuring, and that an extia- ordinary amount of activity by Turkish agents was going on in that area. 1 his may be so, as it would be the easiest task for such agents to work among a popula- ^hon so closely connected with the Turks, especially if the local inhabitants suspected Russian intrigue among their hereditary enemies the Kurds nearby. As I see it, part of this uneasy atmosphere arises from the mutual distrust ol Angora and Moscow reflected at the perimeter; the Turks think that Russia intends to stay in Northern Persia now for good, and the Russians think that sooner or later Turkey will betray us and let the enemy through. The other factor is that the over-guileful Kurds may be playing for support in both camps, visiting both sides and giving whatever “information” is best suited to set Turks, Russians and Persians by the ears, and to increase their own chances of being left alone in the Kurdish areas without effective control from either. I have heard that the Kurds in Sauj Bulagh, on whom I reported last week, have told the Persian authorities bluntly that they can quite well continue to run their own show, and do not want the gendarmes back among them. 10. Sarkang Saif, the chief of police here, tells me that a good many of the undesirable “ refugee ” elements from Soviet Russia, who used to be segregated in various country districts and not allowed to come to Tabriz, have managed during the recent confusion to slip into the underworld of this town and to migrate to Tehran. Some of the Armenians among them are known to have gone to Isfahan to join the large Armenian community at Julfa, where they will sooner or later give trouble to the police. 11. Trade still languishes, although I hear in reliable quarters that a lot of money is returning to the town from Tehran. Undoubtedly, some of the merchants here are not interested in trade at present, but only in holding stocks against firmly-expected future shortages. I have already reported how this complicates the sugar problem, even when supplies are plentiful, and another instance is that of the cheap Russian textiles, which have just been brought in duty-free. It seems that the Soviet agents here wished to benefit the poorer classes by cutting out the usual middlemen (who made such scandalous fortunes under the German clearing schemes), and selling to smaller merchants. They reckoned, however, without Persian greed and lack of principle if they really cherished such ideas. The middlemen were ready to offer an immediate profit of 2,000 rials per bale to the small men, and then consign the goods to their private warehouses for holding, instead of any nonsense of selling cheap to the poor, whom they are as ready to deprive of bread as of clothing, as I reported in September last. More than 1,000 bales of textiles have been dealt with in this way. 12. There have been no cases of Soviet officers entering and robbing private houses during the last fortnight. Perhaps the departure of the Russo-Armenian regiments is responsible for this improvement, or else Major-General Novikoff’s promise to me to deal most severely with any new offenders. The local police tried to arrest a suspicious looking group of civilians the other night, and when the latter ran away fired at them, killing one of them in the street outside the Turkish Consulate. Since then no burglaries have been reported for several days. 13. On the 7th November, the Soviet anniversary of the Revolution, no military parade was held as planned. Major-General Novikoff gave a small cocktail-party at his residence in the evening, followed by a special performance at the local theatre by the Baku Operatic Company. The Minister of the United States and Mrs. Dreyfus were present, with the military attache from Tehran and the United State's Air Attache from Angora. Next day the Red Army gave a kind of cavalry gymkhana display, to which the leading Persian officials and residents were invited. Major-General Novikoff arrived somewhat late, escorted by four ballet-girls from the opera, and his lady A.D.C., who occupied the seats of honour on each side of him. As a special mark of favour I was invited half-way through the performance to sit between two of the charmers. The Russian riding was good, but the horses distinctly poor. I have, &amp;e. F. A. G.

Consul Cook to Sir R. Bullard. fV\ | ?&gt; A-arw-cvwX*, O (No. 46. Confidential.) Sir, Tabriz, November 3, 1941. I HAVE the honour to report that the situation at Tabriz remains quiet, with an admittedly greater feeling of confidence among the local population, now that some of the Russian troops have withdrawn, as promised. It is even said that a few Tabriz residents have returned here from Tehran, where they found general conditions no better and the cost of living much dearer. Even so, it cannot be pretended that conditions are anything like normal while trade is so bad and money so short. The prices of foreign goods in the shops are even more fantastic than they were three months ago, examples being : 50 rials (75.) for a tin of sardines, 420 rials (£3) for a bottle of whisky or brandy, and 10 rials (Is. 5rf.) per metre for ordinary flexible electrical cord. Of course, nobody buys at such prices, and it is difficult to see why retailers should preclude any chance of sale or turnover in this way. 2. The Russian Trade Organisation, on the other hand, is reported to be doing a comparatively flourishing business by importing goods without paying customs duties, apparently claiming that Soviet imports should be exempt from Persian duties in what is an occupied zone. This might perhaps carry weight if they were supplying their own soldiers and officials only, but the goods they are bringing in include crockery and glass-ware, alcoholic liquors, cheap cloth and silk or artificial silk shawls and kerchiefs, obviously for the general popula tion. I have already alluded to the huge profits the Russian authorities must be making on the sugar they are bringing here (equally duty-free)—at a time when British Cabinet Ministers and the B.B.C. declare that we are sending sugar to Russia from the United Kingdom. The local director of customs has been instructed from Tehran, however, to insist on the payment of duty on Russian imports; an impasse has been reached, and M. Agaronoff, the Torgpred repre sentative here, has gone to Tehran to discuss the matter at the Soviet Embassy. 3. I learn that, from wherever the money may have been found, the salaries and arrears of local officials in most departments, including the police, have now been paid, and certain army officers and non-commissioned officers held up here for lack of pay have been enabled to leave for Tehran and elsewhere or have been enrolled in the new gendarmerie. Meanwhile, the 200 regular army officers interned by the Soviet military authorities in the first days of the occupation are still cooped up in a miserable building week after week for no apparent reason, except that no orders for their release have been received from Moscow. 4. Major-General Novikoff left Tabriz last week for an unknown destination and has not yet returned. In his absence a party of five British officers and war correspondents arrived unannounced, wishing to take pictures of and describe the lives of Russian soldiers. The major-general left in charge declined, in spite of [24—21] RECd. FOIL* BERt, 160EC1941 INDIA OFFICE ! ) *2 repeated visits, to grant the party any facilities whatever, and so their somewhat expensive trip ended in failure. As the Russian staff officers said, the visit might have been successful if the Soviet Embassy in Tehran had been consulted before hand and had recommended the granting of the facilities requested, but, unfortunately, this was not done. One photographer has stayed on for another week, hoping to be allowed to take pictures of the special military parade on the^^ 7th November; meanwhile, he has been stopped even from photographing Russian troops strolling in the main streets of Tabriz. 5. General Jahanbani, Minister of the Interior, arrived here from Tehran on the 30th October on a tour of inspection of Azerbaijan. Some years ago he was in command of a regular military expedition against the Kurds in this province, so that his visit to the Rezaieh district next week should be useful. This time he will have to rely on gendarmerie forces, as the Russians are not likely to allow regular Persian troops to enter this area, although it is said that Sarbakhti and his forces are moving into position to attack the dissident Kurds between this and the British-occupied zone. A total force of 1,500 gendarmes for Azerbaijan is aimed at, and details of their distribution have been given to the Russian authorities. 6. Last week when a small party of gendarmerie were occupying Sofian, on the main road to Julfa, they were fired on by some of the inhabitants, killed three and withdrew until next day to bring reinforcements. On the second attempt, a party of Russian soldiers opened fire on them with a machine gun, killing one gendarme and wounding another. Again they withdrew to Tabriz, and two Russian officers were sent to investigate. The matter was quickly settled, and it was explained that the villagers mistook the armed gendarmes for bandits believed to be in the neighbourhood. The story helps to show the confused state of affairs in the province still. 7. The local demagogues who are clamouring for a clean sweep and com pletely new elections in Azerbaijan (at which they, of course, hope to be elected) are becoming more vociferous, and their journal, Sahind, even more vituperative. Their line is that, under the new Constitution the Deputies elected during the ex-Shah’s regime are no longer true representatives of the people, having been chosen by force and corruption. Seeing the Government in Tehran unwilling to agree at once to this argument, they hint that, if any trouble arises in Azerbaijan, the Central Government will be responsible, and say that, even if 2 million Azerbaijanis are killed in defence of their “ rights,” the rest will not be put off. Their paper asks which is the more shameless and detestable—the Shah who ran away when he saw he was hated, or the gang of usurpers in Parliament who still remained entrenched in spite of the curses heaped upon them for the last two months by all the people, and so on. 8. During the few days that the minister was in Tabriz this last week, he spoke to a gathering of about 200 of the leading citizens. After giving the usual advice about national unity, supporting the new regime, working for better things, and the like, he explained that, under the Constitution, new T elections could not be held without the initiative of the Majlis itself, and therefore the ballot held a few months ago for all Azerbaijan must still hold good. Thereupon three of the malcontents, Aghazadeh (editor of Sahind), Bivang and Haiderzadeh rose to protest and say they could not bear the continuance of the situation of the last twenty years, and that something must be done. 9. I learn that a diplomatic way has been found out of the difficulty by the Governor-General’s declaring that, while the elections for the Province of Azerbaijan must stand without question, the balloting-boxes for the nine Deputies for the city of Tabriz itself were broken open or carried off or tampered \\ ith by the Russian forces at the moment of occupation before the votin°’-papers therein had been fully counted, and that new elections should be held here accordingly. These elections will probably take place in a few weeks and the demagogues are not so likely to be elected here as they would have been in a more rural and ignorant constituency in Azerbaijan, which is what they were aiming at. ' J 10. It is thought In some that these so-called democrats are working with the approval, if not the support, of the Russians here and tryiim to win the favour of the artisan classes, because they have few adherents among^the middle- class voters and vote-controllers. They are expected to try and stage a demon-stration here on the 7th November, the Soviet anniversary of the revolution, which might cause embarrassment to the local authorities, and I have spoken, therefore, to Major-General Novikolf, suggesting that no encouragement should be given by his political officers to any meetings or processions on the part of the local elements on that day. His somewhat evasive reply was that the local authorities ^should deal with any undesirable incidents as they think best, but my impression is that the latter are not at all keen on dealing firmly with persons who may have the moral backing of the mysterious Nkvd. I am told that when the Persian police at Ardebil arrested some democratic demonstrators recently the Russian authorities suggested, after a couple of days, that they should be released, and. of course, they were let go. 11. The sugar problem seems to be easier, and distribution is being made to inhabitants on the basis of their official identity cards. Wheat is coming freely into the town from the villages on strings of camels and donkeys; the city's consumption is about 70 tons per day and the rest goes to the Government silo! I have, &amp;e. F.

Trade and commerce, however, remain stagnant, and it is estimated that at least 5,000 men are unemployed in the town, bactones are open, but working on a very much reduced scale. Public order is bettei, following on gradual police reorganisation, and the gendarmerie have established posts along the main roads in the immediate area of Tabriz, while more serious efforts are being made to collect rifles in the villages. I he new chief of police informed me that he is trying to increase the city’s police from 400 to 900, which may betoken nervousness, or may merely show how inadequate and inefficient it was before. ... , ^ o i i, 2. During the week I paid a rapid visit to Maragha and to oauj Euiagh, south of Lake Urmia. I found conditions along the roads and in these towns quiet, and saw few Russian soldiers. When talking to middle-class residents ol Maragha, however, I heard the usual stories of looting and thieving by Soviet troops, and of general insecurity and banditry in the country districts, where no landowner now dare go. At Miandoab I was able to inspect the large sugar factory (managed bv a Czech engineer), which should now be starting work, but | is held up for lack of sugar beet, due to the difficulty of obtaining proper transport. I saw beet being brought on slow-moving bullock-carts and on camel- back, but the manager said it would take three weeks to start the factory. Luckily, next day four lorries arrived from Tabriz, sent by the Governor-General from those which he had detained belonging to the Tehran Government. It is doubtful whether the proper output of 5,000 tons of sugar will be produced this year, however, as some beet areas are far away, and it is said that the Kurds are not likely to toil at digging and carting sugar beet for miles while the more lucrative ancestral profession of raiding and robbing other people’s villages and crops is again open to them. At Sauj Bulagh I lunched with three of the leading Kurdish residents, the brother of one of whom governs and polices the town and district in the absence of either Russian or Persian administration. They had nothing; much to complain of, except the poor prospect of selling their present stocks of wool, hides and tobacco. (This small district markets about 10 million rials’ worth of wool annually.) The trade in sheep smuggled over into Iraq would, of course, go on as usual. They showed no enthusiasm when I told them that the Govern ment gendarmerie would now return before long. The Russians had visited the town but not stayed for long; their bombing of such a place, with unfortunate results to several of the most prominent houses, seemed to me most stupid and uncalled for. I found the ordinary inhabitants again wearing their proper native dress, and my hosts, although dressed in European suits, wore the fringed Kurdish turban when they walked with me into the stieet. [24—20] RECd. POL. DEPt. l 6U£C &lt;941 INDIA OFFICE •n3. Major-General Novikoff returned to Tabriz from Tehran with his stall on the 21st October and received me on the following day. He told me oi the official agreement to allow the local Administration to restore Jaw and ordei without hindrance on the part of the forces of occupation. I spol\e to him ot the local sugar problem and faulty distribution, and he promised to remedy ^ matters. I also spoke of the continued searching and pillaging of P ri vate houses here by Russian officers and soldiers, and the major-general replied that any offenders caught were severely dealt with, some having been shot. 4. Nevertheless, only a few days after our interview four Russian soldiers visited the house of a well-known family in Tabriz late at night, cowed the occupants with revolvers and made off with 25,000 rials and a large quantity of jewellery. The Soviet authorities traced them and recovered the jewellery, but not the money; I have not heard whether they were punished or not. It is, m fact, an anomalous state of affairs, since, whether individual officers may or may not loot with impunity, the Red Army continues to carry off loot officially or semi-officially without any apparent misgiving, or even concealment. As I have repeatedly reported, occupied buildings, whether Government offices or private houses, are practically emptied of their contents when the troops leave them. I myself saw one day last week, an army bus of the old char-a-banc type being driven leisurely by two Soviet soldiers along the main street towards the station, laden with rolled-up Persian carpets, and it is reasonably certain that these had not been bought and paid for. When the Governor-General gave a reception yesterday in honour of the Shah’s birthday he had to collect furniture and carpets from various sources, as the Russian highest military officers had not left a thing when they vacated the governorate a fortnight before. 5. In addition to the formal reception mentioned (held in the morning), the Governor-General gave an evening party in the Town Hall, which was attended by the Russian G.O.C. and his staff, and by many members of the Baku theatrical company. Few Persian ladies graced the party this year, as nearly all the leading local families have left weeks ago for Tehran, as already reported. The Royal toast was given by the Turkish Consul-General (doyen of the Consular Corps here) and replied to by the Governor-General, but the Russian Major-General made no speech. The atmosphere was a reasonably friendly one, but hardly cordial. 6. On the night of the 23rd/24th October large forces of Russian troops, with their armoured cars and transport vehicles, left the town in the direction of the Soviet frontier. Rumours had been circulating for some days that all the troops were going to leave Tabriz (and even Azerbaijan), and when the rumble of military vehicles continued long after midnight, the civil and police authorities began to become seriously alarmed. The first thing they seem to have done was to post police guards hurriedly on their own offices and residences, so acute was their fear of an immediate outbreak of disorder or looting if the Russian forces really were withdrawing. Next day, however, it was seen that the Soviet headquarters and many troops were still here, and on the 25th fresh troops (mostly cavalry and what looked like light artillery) arrived from the north, possibly from the Caucasus itself. In reply to my previous questions on departures of troops all that the Soviet Brigadier would say was that ‘ ‘ re-grouping ’ ’ was taking place. An interesting version current in some circles in the town is that the Russians have decided to remove entirely the Russo-Armenian regiments which they brought from over the frontier in the first weeks of the occupation. They thought these regiments, speaking the same Azerbaijan dialect as in Tabriz and district, would do useful work for them among the local population besides merely military duties, but they have been disappointed (so the version runs). The Armenian minority here is not popular with the preponderant Moslem population, and is accused of containing some of the worst elements, including many who were in the U.S.S.R. until a few years ago, when they came here as penniless and godless “ refugees ”—or spies. Some of the Soviet soldiers who visited private houses at night and extorted money in company with civilian informers are thought to be of the Armenian race. But what worried the Russian commanders most, it is said, is that such Armenians in the Red Army could easily find civilian clothes and temporary shelter with the co-reglionists here when they decided to desert, and afterwards could travel easily to other parts of Persia, being practic ally indistinguishable from local Armenians. Many of the latter, pro-German in sentiment, believe and have convinced their cousins in Russian uniform that desperate fighting will soon occur when the German armies reach the Caucasus3 and Persia^—and so desertions were becoming far too numerous. Hence the arrival of fresh Russian regiments, it is explained. 7. Whatever the facts, the nervousness of the local authorities at the thought of the complete evacuation of Tabriz by the Russian forces is not altogther unfounded. The police are not yet in a position to control the lawless elements as effectively as the sight of Russian bayonets still does. During the last two months there has been a good deal of thieving, pilfering and pick-pocketing among the idle and unemployed, respect for the Persian Administration which collapsed so ignominiously has not been restored, and there are several local demagogues waiting for a chance to attack and possibly oust the Tehran-controlled local Government which at present they are doing their best to discredit. It is quite probable that if the Soviet forces suddenly left, looting of food, and other, shops by the riff-raff would begin, followed by racial attacks on the detested and allegedly Russophile Armenian inhabitants, and then by pseudo-political attacks on local Government offices and buildings as an expression of discontent with Tehran. Any such disorders in Tabriz might easily spread like wildfire among the villages and small towns of all Azerbaijan, where there is still no sign of official administration, although the gendarmerie are now beginning to reorganise their former system of posts and patrols. The Russian troops, however, are not leaving as feared, and a military review is believed to be planned for the 7th November, the anniversary of the revolution. 8. I have now heard of one Persian official in Azerbaijan who remained at his post when all others fled on the 25th August. He was the chief of police at Maragha, a small town 80 miles south-west of Tabriz, and said it was his duty to remain. According to my informant on the spot, he was visited at his private house by the Soviet detachment which occupied the town and shot dead with a machine gun, his body being left outside until next day. 9. No Iraqi consular officer has yet arrived to replace the consul killed here over two months ago, and it is said by one Iraqi merchant in touch with the legation that three officials in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Bagdad have resigned or threatened to resign rather than come to Tabriz.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that the general situation at Tabriz continues to improve gradually, and that, while no one pretends to do other than dislike the Russian occupation still, the feeling of nervousness and unrest is diminishing. In part this may be due to the fact that many Soviet troops have undoubtedly returned to Russia, as well as tanks, armoured cars and equipment, and there are even comforting rumours that before long all the Soviet forces in Persia will retire, and small garrisons of British troops will take their place /m&gt;-v Consul Cook zo (No. 44. Sir, Confidential.) in the north. i t, u 2. On the other hand. Major-General Novikoff has now returned to I abriz from Tehran with his staff, and tells me that he is commander-in-chief of all Soviet forces in Persia. Apparently a Russian garrison will remain at Kasvm, where liaison with the British forces will be maintained. 3. Major-General Novikoff told me that agreement had been reached with the Tehran authorities regarding the re-establishment of law and order in this part of the country by means of the Persian gendarmerie, and that no obstacles will be placed in the way of the local authorities in their efforts to restore proper order, provided that they act in an honest and helpful manner. This, if really meant, is reassuring news, since a new colonel of Persian gendarmerie has just arrived, and is setting about his task of restoring his services in Azerbaijan, beginning with the small towns near Tabriz, and intending to get those of Rezaieh on a proper footing as soon as possible. He called on me and asked for my co-operation; I have accordingly recommended his good intentions to various Russian civil and military authorities during recent discussions with them. 4. News from the Kurdish districts continues to be somewhat disquieting, but may of course be exaggerated. The districts now mentioned as scenes of particular atrocities are Saggiz and I shnu. The Kurds are said to have been using handsaws to murder their victims, who no doubt include some of the hated former gendarmerie. On the other hand, the news from the well-known towns in Azerbaijan along the main routes is not bad, although there is undoubtedly a feeling of general insecurity in the country districts, where not only Kurd but ordinary local Robin Hoods are ranging the villages and mountains, exacting toll of rich and not-so-rich alike. The'landowners cower in the towns listening to talks of the seizure of their wheat, barley and other produce in the villages by their Moslem tenants, and to stories of the Russian troops’ pillaging of warehouses, stores and private houses in the towns. They have their carpets, jewellerv and valuables all ready packed, and as opportunity offers flee to Tabriz and thence to Tehran. Even if no harm befalls them, they live in a perpetual [24—96] 13 JAN 942 INDIA OFFICE2 state of apprehension and resentment, and spend then ime g Bolshevik menace and at the hated ex-Shah who brought t en iou ^ ii i u A gendarmerie officer told me that some villages are vir ua y j so-called “refugees,' i.e., Armenians from Russia, who copy Soviet armlets as a sign of authority, and who are said to call on ^ neaiest S t ^ garrison for advice and assistance if they meet with opposition 01 it y gendarmes from Tabriz approach too close. With my experience of thebe f^ y in Tabriz itself, I am prepared to believe there may be something m these stone^ 5. Fierce criticism of the ex-Shah and of the Tehran administratmn both of the past and of the present, were expressed m an issue of a ^ ^ e ^ s f P ^ ’ Sahind, last week. The editor (a hack journalist of the poorest type and a fo ^ sycophant of the Shah like the rest) bitterly attacked e e which and oppressors, and called for cheers for the Russian forces o P ’ , £ or had restored some measure of liberty for this part of y ’ ti i London which by its broadcasts had reminded people of then constitutiona rights so long trampled underfoot. The staff of the Turkish Consulate-Genera^ here had to sit up until 4 a.m. translating the whole newspaper ^ ^ . courier eoing next day to Angora. The Russians are now publishing newspaper ^Turkish for the local population called For the — mg a good deal of Communist propaganda of course, but n°*dn n 0 provocative or objectionable as far as local conditions are concernecL fhey have iust finished a whole week of opera performances by the State Opeia Company TBaku which were well attended by the local inhabitants, and^to which the leadino- officials were invited. I myself found the entertainment suipnsmgly good 'whether as regards voices, costumes, acting or production generally. A concert by Moscow performers is to take place soon, and plays by Georgian and Armenian companies are promised in the next few weeks r , 6. A sudden surprise was sprung last week also by the ^ 0 ^ ein0 i y: ( ^ en ^ : Khalil Fehimy, who arranged a social evening m the town Imll, to which abou sixty Persian notables and thirty or so Russian superior officers were ir } vlte ^- There was a buffet supper, at which speeches were made and toasts drunk by the Governor-General and by the Russian commanding officer (and as an unfortunately “ary corollary, by myself) full of the usual diplomatic insincerities,' but they were well applauded, and certainly there was a thawed and outwardly friendly atmosphere between Persians and Russians which I had not seen before. The Governor-General told me afterwards slyly with what pleasure he had watched the toast to the new Shah being drunk by certain prominent citizens of Tabriz who spent most of their time decrying the Pahlev dynasty—past, uresent and future. The Russian brigadier-general s reference to Anglo-Russian 'friendship and collaboration sounded most refreshingly sincere. A new chief of police named Sarhang Saif arrived heie last week oin Abadan. He has been at Tabriz before and was widely respected and praised for his character and efficiency, so that local police conditions may agyun improve from the slovenly and corrupt state into which they had fallen during the past year Not so many stories of burglary and petty disorder are now heard in le town but I fear that incidents of Russian soldiers (more probably n.c.os., entering nrivate houses without authority still continue. I spoke to the newly-returned Maior-General Novikoff about this, and he said that a serious view was taken of such acts; one Russian caught in the act has been shot recently and others severely punished ^ ^ ^ ^ to the p ersuas ion of the so-called Armenian riff-raff that these incursions continue. It is they who wish to rob and loot the middle-class Moslem houses and so induce a couple of uniformed Russians rknnmnanv them If the Germans were to come here, these undesirables would nrobihlv P be willing to do the same, if they dared. One interesting fact I have noticed for the first time recently is that the local Persian Armenians are now Winning to become nervous and to talk of leaving Tabriz, whereas it was only Moslems hitherto who were running away. Some are thinking of going to Russia, )ifleThe better off would go to Tehran and Isfahan. They have apparently been hifected ^ h the Tear that “something” will happen soon in Tabriz and kktoimn most probably a German or Turco-German occupation, and then the Armenians rmiy receive short shrift, both from the resentful Moslem population, and perhaps from the Germans who may lump all Armenians together as Russian3 sympathisers. Actually many middle-class Armenians are as pro-German and Nazi-minded as the worst Persian Moslem is. One extraordinary rumour current here is that some of the Russo-Armenian troops are buying civilian dress and asking their local Armenian acquaintances to hide them in case of trouble meaning when the Germans or Turks (or both) arrive. Whatever low standards ^^one may give to Armenian valour, this story is hard to believe, and is possibly one of the pro-German efforts at causing local disquiet. 9. Public order is being preserved in a makeshift way, and the Russian garrison authorities have few illusions about the character and abilities of the local police. Part of the improvement is probably due to the continued presence of the former as much as anything. The Ogpu (or rather N.K.V.D.) have now apparently turned their chief attention to the local Georgians, Russo-Armenians and other persons of Russian origin who have been domiciled here for perhaps twenty years or more, and they in turn are going through the nocturnal questionings and terroristic inquisitions by Soviet agents ferreting out every detail of their doings for years past. Some have even been ordered to furnish written autobiographies as quickly as possible. These also would like to escape to Tehran and elsewhere, but are too frightened to try. 10. The question of sugar supplies is still a baffling one. Ample supplies are in the town, but there are still unruly queues at the shops when sugar is being sold, and many peaceful citizens or housewives have to pay twice the proper price to the rag-tag who pass their time in these queues. I have reliable information that the Sherkati Qand (Sugar Commission) are holding about 66,000 bags of sugar, but are refusing to sell to the public because they do not agree with the manner in which the Russians for their part are selling to the public. The Soviet authorities, mistakenly in my opinion, are distributing their supplies of sugar through three or four retailers only, which encourages queues and shortages. I am even tempted to believe that the Persian profiteers arrange for people to buy up the Russian sugar improperly, in order to create continuous shortage. They think they cannot lose by laying up stocks however acquired, since one day sooner or later there will be a shortage and they must gain. Undoubtedly many private persons who can afford it have laid by ten or twenty bags of sugar each. All my unremitting efforts for months past and those of a few well-intentioned persons are thus nullified by poor Russian organisation and by the unqualified greed, graft and complete lack of patriotism or public feeling of most of the local Persian middle-class. 11. Supplies of wheat continue to be plentiful in Tabriz, where local peasants are happy to bring in grain to the Government silo at a price of 900 or even 1,000 rials per ton (as against 650 rials in August). 1 learn that many peasants are willing to sell to local bakeries at lower prices than this—and the reason is that their consciences tell them that the more unofficially they dispose of their wheat, largely stolen from the village landowners’ stores, the better it may be for them, with no questions asked and no names written down. The local silo now holds over 2,000 tons of wheat, or about one month’s supply for Tabriz. Part of this has been collected by Government lorries taken over by the Governor- General. It is difficult to say whether any appreciable surplus of wheat is available for export to other parts of Persia, because estimates of the crop vary and much of the grain has been carried off by peasants from the village stores and hidden. In Tabriz it is believed that the Azerbaijan crop has been a good one this year, but in Maragha a landowner told me it was poor. In any case there is no transport available for proper collection, whatever the size of the crop may be. And local villages may refuse to sell their stocks because they fear partial famines such as have occurred in past years owing to Persian maladministration and corruption, when even seed-stocks and the necessary winter bread supplies were carried off at disgracefully low prices by the minions of the Wheat Monopoly unless suitable bribes were forthcoming. The memory of these things is not wiped out by a palace revolution in Tehran and a few honeyed promises of reform on the radio. However, I have been informed in a reasonably reliable quarter that about 1,000 tons of wheat ought to be available for export to the southern parts of Persia. This, of course, would not go very far. 12. The Governor-General has received promise of a gift of 2 million rials from the new Shah for the building of a hospital at Tabriz. Presumably such largess is meant to sweeten popular recollection of the untold millions of thenational wealth appropriated by his imperial Sire. Laudable as such an object of mercy may be. in my humble opinion any freely liquid funds are needed at the present moment rather for the restoration of public order and indispensable public services, to say nothing of a cheapening of the cost of living for the poorest of the poor. It will be quite a time before the word “ Shah ” is mentioned in this part of the country with any affection, and an effort at honest administration aiming at general provincial prosperity would be more useful than loudly- advertised gifts, only a small part of which will probably reach their real charitable destination.

Mil * * i- TT'/v Enclosure. (V Consul Cook to Sir R. Bullard. g^r, ^ ^ Tabriz, October 13, 1941. I HAVE the honour to inform you that the position during the past week in Tabriz has quietly improved, and that on the surface things appear to be returning to normal. The condition of the Province of Azerbaijan, however, is not so good, and in some parts there is still little or no Government administration of any kind. . T i 2. Recent information confirms previous reports that to the south ot hake Urmia, particularly in the town and neighbourhood of Sauj Bulagh, there are neither Russian-occupying forces norany form of Persian authority civil, military or police. The town of Sauj Bulagh. for instance, is being administered m an amateur way by a Kurdish notable having some religious prestige, with the aid of a private police force. As it happens, he is well-disposed towards the absentee Persian Government and appears to be willing to hold oh the wilder Kurdish elements who are pillaging and harrying the countryside between there and the Turkish and Iraqi frontiers. The nearest Russian troops are at Miandoab, about 25 miles away, and on the other side I have heard of none nearer than Rezaieh. 60 miles distant. Kurds are said to have looted and burnt the custom-house at Khaneh, where the Rowanduz road enters Persia, so that this route is at present impossible for ordinary communications. At Sardasht, further south neai the Iraq border, they are said to have besieged and massacred the whole Persian garrison some weeks ago, either military or gendarmerie. I am unable to say whether the Soviet forces are attacking the Kurds at present, but I have reason to believe that they are worried by their lawlessness, and I have even heard that they tend to blame us because many of the Kurds operating slightly further to the south are using British rifles. There has been some talk of the Russians reorganising and rearming the Persian gendarmerie in the Rezaieh area in order to deal with the tribes in their mountain lairs, where the Soviet troops probably find it difficult to operate. This, however, is a question which needs rapid decision in Tehran, and it certainly seems to have important advantages, both from the point of view of repressing the Kurds by men trained to the task, and also minimising the risk of unfortunate incidents between Russian tioops and Turkish frontier guards along the mountainous and not always well-defined borders. 3. I am informed from a good source, who has a political friend in Turkey, that Rashid Ali, on his way from Tehran to Turkey, got in touch with certain Kurdish tribal leaders in the frontier region and made various promises to them, doubtless on behalf of his German masters, and that he may be intriguing with them even now. The Turkish authorities thought they had ‘ ‘ liquidated 5 ’ the Kurdish problem in their own frontier areas during the last few years, but it seems less certain now that they succeeded, to judge by the effervescence on the border, where movement is undoubtedly hard to check. I am told by the Governor- General that Kurds are coming right up to Tabriz itself to buy arms and [24—26] RECd. POL, DEPt. ) 60EC &gt;941 INDIA OFFICE2 ammunition from among the quantities hidden or thrown away by the soldiery on the 25th and 26th August, and that they pay betweeen 1,000 and 1, rials for a rifle. When they are fully armed they may offer an interesting held for German agents and would-be Wassmusses, beguiled by stories of then £ jy an kinship with the Herrenvolk and by promises of national independence liom . Turkish. Arab and Persian rule alike. 4. The Soviet authorities still refrain from active open propaganda m Tabriz, but they have brought a number of actors and musicians from Baku to show the local populace that Communists are not barbarians, as they are imported to have explained on the first night. There are Russian films, too, at the cinemas, which cannot be called objectionable, but yet have, of course, a piopagandist flavour. Where more effect is apparently being caused in this respect is m the smaller towns and villages of Azerbaijan, where rougher and junior mi.itaty officers and military police mix more freely with certain elements of the local inhabitants and are ready to spread Communist doctrine, although perhaps not on an organised scale. I am told by Persians who have been to small places iiKe these—Khoi, Rezaieh and Maragha—that the Russians present films of a pseudo- historical nature (with dialogue in Azerbaijani 3 urkish) of which the plot is nearly always the greed and cruelty of former landlords in Russia, and the successful revolt of the peasants against their oppression. The Azerbaijani peasants need little such incentive to rouse them against their greedy arbabs, and, as I have already reported, the latter dare not now go near their villages, where their crops and dues for this autumn have been seized and stolen without let or hindrance on the part of the Soviet forces. 5. In fact, it seems reasonably certain that in the country districts the Russian authorities, both officers and men, have themselves indulged in same places in widespread confiscations which often amount to mere plundering. The Astara agent of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had 15,000 wooden poles removed with no prospect of payment; at the lake-port near Rezaieh the Soviet soldiers took hundreds of tins of kerosene and petrol from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company stocks and exchanged them for food and necessities from the villagers; stocks of wool and dried fruit have been pillaged quite openly from private stores, and the soldiery have broken into private houses, removing property and even cutting out the wooden floors for firewood. Of course, these things happen everywhere in wartime and in war areas, but here in Azerbaijan it is not a war area, there is no fighting or no man’s land, and military discipline ought to be able to check these things in what are peaceful occupied districts. 6. In Tabriz a certain amount of looting continues, although less freely than before. Russian n.c.os. are said to enter private houses for money, but not officers, after the incident reported in my last despatch. It is said that some Russian officers have recently bought civilian clothes, and a few days days ago the house of a Persian judge was visited in the night by a party of civilians who spoke only Russian, and who packed quantities of his carpets and possessions into a waiting lorry and drove away. Two night ago a band of seven men tried to enter the local customs warehouse, but were seen by the Russian military guard, who killed two and wounded three. 7. In response to the Governor-General’s persuasion and pressure, the local factory-owners have reopened their works, which will presumably function for as long as stocks of raw material last—probably a matter of a few months at the most. Supplies of bread and of most staple foods are plentiful in the town, but the sugar problem still remains. On most days there are, jostling crowds round the sugar retailers, for two reasons: one is that outlying districts have no supplies or nearly none, and people can buy in Tabriz and sell it there for three or four times the price; the other reason is that many of the local inhabitants are buying up sugar, either as winter provisions for themselves, or as a speculative investment against later shortages. The Persian authorities have instituted a form of rationing whereby every householder buying sugar must present his police identity-booklet and have it marked with the quantity bought (1 kilog. per month), but the Russians have distributed sugar to their chosen retailers with no such restrictions, with the result that uncontrolled and unnecessary purchases from them have been encouraged. The price of sugar is now going to be raised, in order to discourage excessive buying.3 8. This is a minor further illustration of what has been said before about a lack of co-operation and often foresight among the various Russian branches. The different departments do not always appear to know what each other are doing, and changes of personel are continuous. As a further example—in spite . of the heavy Soviet seizures of nearly all motor vehicles here, both lorries and passenger cars, the garrison commandant recently asked the Persian Governor if he could obtain a motor-car for him, as he was provided with no official means of transport and was much handicapped in his work thereby. 9. A certain transport shortage continues; the wretched owner-drivers of lorries whose vehicles were first commandeered by the Persian forces and then carried off by the Red Army, still remain without means of livelihood or hope of any compensation. The Soviet officials tell them to claim compensation or replace ment from the Persian Government, and the latter say they should continue to worry the Russian authorities for the return of their lorries—which by this time are probably on the Eastern front. An ugly scene one day last week was caused by some of these chauffeurs threatening to seize the Tehran cars which brought the German and Italian parties to the frontier. Meanwhile the sugar-beet crop in the Southern Azerbaijan area is in danger of rotting to waste because there is I no transport to convey the beet to the sugar factory at Miandoab, which normally I produces about 5.000 tons of sugar each season. I have spoken to the Russian Trade Commissioner here about this, and he has promised to arrange matters, but I have no great hopes of results. Perhaps representations made to the Soviet Embassy or military authorities in Tehran might be of more weight. A few lorries will probably be sent from Tabriz this next week for the purpose by the Persian authorities. 10. Nothing more has been done about the large seizure of goods from the Tabriz custom-house described in my previous despatch, but the Russian Trade Commissioner has promised the Director of Customs that the goods which had been wholly paid for by Persian importers will be returned here in due course. Little reliance can be placed in this promise. I fear. The same official has promised for sure to obtain the return of the lorries belonging to British and Iraqi subjects, for which I made urgent representations, but week after week goes by with no result. A total of 5,600 packages were confiscated and carried off to Russia as being German property, in spite of all protests to the contrary. 11. Yesterday a Russian soldier was found stabbed to death near the custom-house. Many arrests have been made, but it seems likely that the assailant may have been a marauder disturbed while trying to climb a wall. 12. I am told by Persians that four train-loads of Russian troops have left here for the Caucasus within the last few days, and that more troops are on their way here from the Maragha area. If this withdrawal becomes extensive, then the Persian gendarmerie must urgently be reorganised in the country districts and especially in the Kurd-infested frontier areas, or else British troops should move up further north towards Lake LTrmia.

As usual, it was tho wind v.nicn caused the trouble oy blowing snow into deep drifts in road cuttings. The total snow-fall probably did not exceed two leet. 1 his wind, the Xirst sustained gale Inis winter, has performed a useful function for agriculture. It is wind which piles the snow into immense drifts in the mountain hollows where it. remains well into ttie summer, providing the streams essential for irrigation. ^ ix o » All available labour has been pressed into tne worK of snow clearance, but it is complicated oj the large number of military vehicles now using the road* The Russians are thrusters pretending to make light of the difficulties as compared with conditions in Russia, but getting themselves well ana truly stuck in snow driits none the less. Then the Persian drivers in cnarge oi u.R.O.O. trucks are undisciplined by nature and always push their trucks forward even when they can see that by doing so they are going to create an iiopasse for say a convoy coming in the opposite direction through a one-way passage, when the wind is actually blowing Persians refuse to work, with reason because the cold is intense. The difficulty on Xebruaiy 28th is * that although the men are at work, the snow walls have in places become so high tnat men cannot throw the fresh drifts out over them. The winter remains, of severe weather, one of tho despite this Delated little spell mildest ever .mown. 52 at first x uU-D L-UPPL IK8. as barley he nad able to w Dodge I reported in my diary No. 5, the Russians seemed disposed to provide transport tnemselves for the lying at Vrdebil; then they snapped at Hr. Vivian that n right to count on tnis help and that they might not be provide transport. Finally, they suddenly produced lorries and in this rather grudging v/ay they have /givenILiven really effective help. Mr. Vivian will now presumably A UQ free to concentrate all his own transport in getting wheat to Tabriz, out naturally his lorries, as well as the .Russian, were immobilized during the last week of iebrua^y. In the period under review Mr. Vivian made a trip to 'gArdabil to clear up some muddle arising out of purchases for ^tne Persian aray. He reported that seme 50 landlords, repres enting a substantial amount of grain, had been arrested in Aidebil, ana 15 at the small town of Sarab, whereas back in ^ Tabriz the figure of the arrested was still only a score or so. He blames tae Governor-General, himself a local landlord, for lack of energy and I understand that my American colleague and he have asked for the Governor-General's removal on this account. Only a few days after they had done so Mr. Vivian learned that the Governor-General had returned the compliment with urgent telegrams asking for his removal, and had been inciting his brother landlords to telegraph separately to the Prime Minister M^Vivtah W fo the same purpose. As Mr. Vivian sees the situation, there r/ 2 are three possibilities, that he should go, that tne Governor- General should go, and tnat he should call off his campaign against the landlords. It is not a happy or a profitable^situa- tion.^ It is a pity that all the energy and drive should be on one side, all the guile and finesse on the other. The two have combined, like oil with water, to work for the public interest. *»nat with snow blocking roads everywhere, and the demands oi the Russians, Mr. Vivian nas nis work cut out to supply Tabriz and there is still no proppect of a surplus being realized f or transport to Tehran. At the end of the month Mr. Vivian found that the government ns Id 12,000 tons of Mie&amp;t and 5,000 tons of barley in its ameers in Azerbaijan, of which 6,000 wheat and 4,500 barley were available, after meetiiig rux’al needs, for Tabriz and Uie Russians. he has Lucre fore had to fell the Russians that he cannot, from such stocks, fulfil the contract with Laen and fnat Tabriz, with only a few days* supply in hand, must have -lint claim. He told the soviet Consul-General tnat naturally if the Governor-General would support tne campaign against tne landlords tne hidden wheat might be brought forth; the Consul-General promised to speak with the Governor-General in that sense; 1 wonder now he speaks with the Governor-General as Out Mr. Vivian and ms policy, the more so since he told Mr. Vivian tnat ne had instructions from Moscow f ;rbidding him to exert pressure on any local authority.

Labour. Nothing to report. 35 . PUBLIC SKCTIRIT Y. On Friday, February 19th, Alia: Amir Khizi having obtained the permission of the Governor reneraj., addressed an audience of several thousands in the public garden# His theme was that the Germans had created a fifthcolumn here, that thanks to the overthrow of fascism by the brave Red Army, ^he main danger had been removed, that neverthe&amp;ess a residue uf Persian fifth columnists were still active in the Perman interest and it was they who were putting up prices. Therefore the citizens of Tabriz must rally to the anti-fascist league* which he wasfonaing and denounce the fascist fifth columnists. Another speaker told the audience that vacancies were being filled in the Municipal Council, not by public election, but by nepotism and intrigue; it was their right to insiston their power to vote. A third speaker continued the tirade against the fascists. The meeting threatened to become a little rough. Just as our own propaganda fails so frequently because we assumes a background which the local population does not possess, so^all this talk about fascism meant little or nothingto workmen whose wages tire rials ten a day, ?/hereas a kilo of gritty bre&amp;d costs twelve. Indeed, a bitter jest mis circulating among thecrowd that anti-fascism was some newkind of bread. Then the speakers withdrew, they were accompanied along the khiaban by a jostling, impatient crowd, »nd it is said that Ali Amir Khizi was white with fright before the police intervened to put him in a carriage and take him away out of it. He did not ranew his address on Friday the 26th. I have suggested totthe Governor-General that a crowd such as assembled on Friday the 19th might get out of hand, but he seemed to think it was better to allow agitators like A.li Amir Khizi to have their way and learn how little response this! talk about ^nti-fascism finds in the people of Tabriz; he thought that the risk of mob violence was not very great, but that it was better to accept it than to bottle up these^ agitators Their silence on the following Friday seems to justify his attitude. On Sunday February 28th a concert was given at the Armenian Club to raise more money towards the tank for the Red Army. Mott people returned the tickets, fearing that they would be held to ransom again as happened at the meeting on February 5th. The murder of the Soviet officer at Khoi (diary No. 2, para.16) has been traced to two Persians; it was an ordinary crime. About ^5 About fcbe middle of February the townamen of Rezaieh nearly got out of hand. The government officials threatened a • general strpce and Colonel J&amp;ahin, Commanding the i ersi&amp;n troops, had to promise to go to Tabriz to plead for cheaper bread before he could calm the populate. All urban populations are similarly agltst ed on account cf high prices. n • RUBSO-riiRS IaK I PITS. I asked my Russian colleague what ■^e thought of the recent speech making in Tabriz. I told him thpt it seemed to me curious thd these men now so outspoken against the fascists had remained silent last summer when every body expected the Germans to be in Tabriz by ueptembei at. the latest, and I suggested that fair-weather friends who only offered a tank when the Red Army was sweeping ahead were of little real value to anyone. Mr. Kuznetsov was quite firmly of the opposite opinion, he thought it y/as a good thing that there should be this public denunciation of fascists and I sensed more satisfaction in his manner than in his actual words. The Armenian Patriarch had, he said, called on all Armenians to contribute to the support of the Red Army, hence the campaign to collect money for a tank. It seemed clear from Mr. KuznetzovH words and manner that this local movement has Russian approbation, probably Russian encouragement, and it is interesting that the recent speeches have all linked high prices and wheat hoarding with fascism and the fifith column, the impliCEition being that the Russians stand for low prices; but they can’t make any success of such pro agenda here where everybody knows that the Russians are buying quantities of all sorts of foodstuifs at high prices. If, on the strength of recent speeches, !ir. Kuznet zov reports that public opinion is veering strongly in favour of Russia, he is confusing activity with efficacy , a mistake which our own propagandists so often sake. Apart from Mr. Kuznetzov’s statement to Mr. Vivian that he had instructions not to bring pressure to bear on any Persian official, I have the impression that my Soviet colleague is cultivating the Governor General raUher assiduously and that as against the two of them Mr. Vivian has little ehanee of making his policy prevail. If the Russians are hostile wo Mr. Vivian as an American they could ask for nothing better then tie present bad relations between him and the Governor Gene-al. As spring approaches the probability that there will be raids bj/ Kurds on both sides of the Turkish frontier approa ches. I have reported to H.M. Legation my impression that there is little chance of Improving security on the frontier zone in time co forestall such raids, but the Governor General seems to be making some effort bo find a solution. His main difficulty arises from the Russian refusal to allow Tehran to supply weapons. He has invited Russian Consular officers from RezaieH /and■iVui-iiX -i- -iv i. iiu 2 i\JK 1945 ♦ '-t- lv3th to 51st January. 12. lijeranae a brief blizzard on January loth and then mid weather again until January 50th when snow fell, three inches in Tabriz but mor© in the surrounding districts. Ah* xdub iir. Vivian, tte Aiuerican now in charge of &lt;ih© finance md subsidiary departiaents, has been &lt;reating a healthy commotion. After visiting two of the iiaportant grain producing areas, ^ara^eh and Ardebil, he pronounced that the Minister of bupply had Miisled us, after his visit to those saiiie centres, in stating that there were there thr&gt;usands of tons of wiieat immed- iately available. Mr. Vivian found that relatively siaall quan tities were available in Government stores situated on motor roads, that by far the greater part of the wheat in Gov© maw at possession was in stores situated at some distance from motor roads, to which the grain could only be brought by slow animal transport; tnat tii© amount of wheat in the Government’s possession was but a fraction, say one-third, of the meat wnich ought to have been delivered uad tin© officials been honest. Mr* Vivian further revealed that Tabriz had no more tnan 16 days* wuaat and il our in stock:, that deliveries of grain, barley in particular, to the Hussians were se iously in arrears and that he must tnerefore reserve all the readily available grain for local coxisumption. Go that was the end of tne struggle to get grain to Tehran, at least for the moment. Mr. Vivian has concentrated motor transport to bring in the &amp; rain immediately available on motorable roads and is striving to press every available animal into service to bring further supplies forward to these points. His next step is to compel defaulting landlords to hand over tneir hoards- At the end ox the month lie was preparing to ask the Governor-General to authorize tneir arrest more or less en masse, beginning with the Tabriz districts. When I say that in this district alone (comprising roughly the area within 25 miles of Tabriz) 250 landlords have refused to give any undertakings or to deliver any grain, the magnitude of Mr. Vivian’s problem will be realized, hut it is worth the fight he seems fully disposed to face because 250 landlords represent a lot of wheat. Then of course there are nundreds of others who have been let off lightly by the officials, for a consideration. Mr. Vivian fully intends to go after them too. If he succeeds in the Tabriz district Mr. Vivian will tackle the rest of the two provinces and a© will encounter the bitter hostility of the landlord class as a whole /andund it f e going to 10,000 against 1.

I drew his attention to the lact that 'Whereas there is much wheat at Marageh, Government lorries carrying goods there have been sent empty away from tnere; that Government lorries have been carrying wheat north wards to Tabriz from depots on the Tehran road just when we so urgently wish to load southbound lorries at these depots. He is 1 lading for himself many other glaring deficiencies; for instance, no serious effort had been made to provide sufficient sacks. I stated in a telegram some time ago that numbers of U.K.C.C. lorries had driven south empty past dumps of wheat on the Tehran road. The Governor-General gave me confirmation of this when ne gave me details of the wheat stored at Buatanabad and other points. Lack of sacks was probably one difficulty, but he admitted that the Finance Department had feared to let this wheat go south until they could be sure of making the landlords disgorge further stocks to meet trie needs of Tabriz ana to fulfil the contract with the Russians. (Actually, the f inance Department had no intention of making the landlords disgorge.)

The file chiefly comprises reports, submitted on a monthly (and later fortnightly) basis by the British Consul-General at Tabriz, reporting on events in Azerbaijan and Tabriz. Reports up to July 1942 are printed, while subsequent reports are typewritten. The typewritten reports are organised under subheadings that vary from one report to the next, but generally cover: weather; agriculture, locust movements, food supply and reports of hoarding; consular tours; the activities of consular colleagues and counterparts; local government, local politics, and elections; Kurdish affairs, including events at Rezaieh [Orūmīyeh]; Armenian affairs; public order; the activities of the Persian, Russian and United States military; trade, commerce and labour; transport and communications, including convoys, and the activities of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation (UKCC); propaganda. From late 1944 onwards the reports increasingly focus on rising political and social unrest in Azerbaijan, which would eventually culminate in the Iran-Azerbaijan crisis of 1946. These later reports focus on the emergence and activities of new political parties (including the Tudeh Party and the Democratic Party), new political newspapers, and Soviet activities in Azerbaijan.The file also includes: correspondence sent by the British Ambassador in Tehran, Reader William Bullard, forwarding the Tabriz Consul’s reports with comments to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; note sheets covering numerous reports, giving a précis of the report’s contents; the translation of a report by the Persian Minister for War, secretly obtained by British sources, describing military and political conditions at Rezaieh, dated 17 May 1942 (ff 560-564); a report of a visit to Rezaieh in February 1945, compiled by the British Consul-General at Tabriz (ff 147-154).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
