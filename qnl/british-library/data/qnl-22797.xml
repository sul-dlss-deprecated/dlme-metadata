Passengers from Cairo for Bahrain or night stopping at Bahrain will be subject to surveillance for a period of 5 days from leaving the Infected Port. Would you kindly let me have a list of all passengers for Bahrain noting against their names inoculated or not. As regards passengers night stopping all that will be required will be to ensure they do not leave the rest house during their stay. The same procedure will be applicable to passengers i from Karachi. If information is received of cholera being prevalent in that port. You will be informed if and when such information is received.

Quarantine measures in connection with aircraft arriving within the incubation period from Cairo. In accordance with Article 30 International Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation vide (95). As regards vessels; as they have long passed the incubation period of 5 days before arrival at Bahrain are classed as clean vessels, and no Quarantine measures are necessary (International Sanitary Convention Sea Horne Traffic Article 29).

Imported - Medical Inspection of all passengers is carried out by Quarantine Medical Officer. Cholera vaccine has been indented for by the Bahrain Government for use of passengers proceeding to infected area; a supply is also being obtained to keep in reserve in case it is’ needed for Trucial Coast. Bahrain is cholera free and no information has been received of cholera in Saudi Arabia. b / The Quarantine restrictions against Bahrain/the latter country on the score of there being* Cholera in India,- Pakistan and China is not justified according in#®* to the International Sanitary Code. We have received no official information from the Government of Saudi Arabia on the subjectr * I attach a letter from Messrs. Gray Mackenzie asking for the inoculation of 600 coolies. I see no reason for these inoculation of persons proceeding to an uninfedted port. If the work of loading and unloading vessels is hampered by the Saudi Arabian Government, it would appear to be their responsibility. Mass Anti cholera inoculation would only be carried out in case of a cholera epidemic in Bahrain, M.L.A, Steele, 9.10.47i CHOLERA IN EGYPT FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT [ CAIRO, Oct. 5 ) Although three positive and five suspected v cases of cholera have occurred, Cairo City has ) not been declared infected, because the posi tive cases entered Cairo from outside. Twenty- six suspected cases have been reported in Cairo suburbs, and the incidence in the pro vinces remains about 100 notified cases a day, of which perhaps one quarter prove to be cholera. Sweeping anti-epidemic measures are still being taken, but the Government declares that the situation is well in hand. : In a letter to Mr. Bevin, Amr Pasha, the 1 Egyptian Ambassador, says:—“ My Govern ment, deeply touched by the prompt response i of the British Government and all the orga- ■ ’ nizations concerned in the appeal to combat 1 the outbreak of cholera in Egypt, have asked e me to convey to you their high appreciation of s this noble and humane gesture. I seize this 1 opportunity to add the expression of my own ' personal appreciation of the spontaneous col- laboration of the Foreign Office and all r concerned.” leP&gt; A. Reference attached - As there is epidemic of infectious disease at Alkhobar or Rastanura, Quarantine restrictionsa are unnecessary.
