Political Department. From, COLONEL R. PHAYRE, c. b ., Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. To, THE COMMISSIONER IN SIND, Kurrachee. Political Superintendent's Office, Jacobahad, Ibth August 1870. A day or two ago in Durbar, when discussing a matter affecting tlte Chief of the Bdog- tee tribe, in which the latter,* according to the custom ^Through his son ShalilwzKhau. 0 f a cen tury, deprecated the Khan's interference with the internal economy and management of his tribe, and solicited permission to address a petition to His Highness on the subject, the Khelat Vakeel remarked that there was no doubt about the Khan's being ' Khan of Beloochistan,' there by implying, as I understood him, that the Khan ought to interfere in the tribal arrange ments of the Murree and Boogtee Chiefs. 2. I refrained from taking notice of the remark, a number of Belooch being present ; but the use of this unusual title, in connection with the matter under discussion, at once called to my mind Captain Harrison's recent introduction of it, as reported in para. 10 ot my letter No. 1127, dated 4th instant, and as the Vakeel would not have adopted the expres sion, except under instructions from Khelat, his doing so, has confirmed the opinion given in para. 23 of my letter No. 1125, dated 30th ultimo ; as also those regarding the incipient- intrigue with the Seistan Belooch, referred to in my letters Nos. 1120 and 1127 of the 4th instant. I therefore addressed the accompanying letter No, 1151, dated 13th instant, to Captain Harrison, which I beg to forward ior your information, in continuation of tin correspondence quoted above. 3. It is impossible to conceive the amount ot mischief which may follow, if tho Khan in his present aggressive mood, should claim any sovereignty whatever over tlie Seistan Belooch, and more than a nominal sovereignty over the hitherto independent tribes of the Murree and Boogtee hills, by virtue of his newly assumed title of ' Khan ot Beloochistan.' 4. What makes the matter more serious is, that Khelat, being a British Protect •'&lt; I State, her acts are believed, and rightly so, to emanate from us, and hence we become inseparably identified with them, whether they are right or wrong. I have &amp;c., K. PHAYRE, Colonel, Political Superintendent, Frontier I ppcr SindrXo. 1151 of 1870. Political Department. From, The Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. To, Captain C. W. Harrison, Political Agent, Khelat. Political Superintendent''s Office, Jacohabad, \3th August 1870, Sir, i oh^ene tiiat in }oiu letter Xo. 42, dated 22hd July last, you designate His Higliness the Khan ot Khelat as the ' Khan ot Beloochistan.' As I have never heard tins title used before, I have the honor to request you will report with whom it originated, with yourself, or with His Highness. nil paiticulars will be required by Government on this important point, as it may ' 1 ^ ^ deal, and it is necessary to ascertain definitely whether you have confer red it on him, and if so, by whose sanction ; and, on the other hand, if His Hio-hness has assumed it himself, what his reasons are for doing so. 3. His Highness' official designation in relation to the British Government is' Chief of Khelat, and also ' Khan ol Khelat,' I request therefore that you will not use any other in voui official conespondence until you receive the orders of Government upon the subject in connection with any reply you may have to give to this letter. 4. I beg to refer you to the Treaty concluded by Major John Jacob, C. B. with the &lt; iiief of Khelat in May 1854, as showing how you have departed from, and exceeded, your authority in this matter.
