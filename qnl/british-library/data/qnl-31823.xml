Cox, C.I.E, Political Agent at Maskat, dated' the 6th September 1903. ******* If Maskat is to be the first place of call, I do not think the visit of the Viceroy would be a good occasion for pressing upon the Sultan anything in the nature of the request for a concession, such as the lease of the Gwadur Customs. News would fly ahead quickly, and the Pirate Coast Chiefs or others might become apprehensive. ******* Our Commercial Treaty with Maskat is under consideration with a view to renewal, and apj irt from this^any new form of engagement which would be ? compatible with the Anglo-IYench Declaration of 1862 does not seem to be practicable, but there are two points with regard to which it would seem possible for us to strengthen the Sultan’s hands and at the same time increase our own influence, and if there is no inherent objection to the proposals that follow, the Viceroy might feel able to make a statement in Durbar in connec tion therewith. 1. Having been unmoved spectators of the attack on Maskat in 1895, during wMck the property of our subjects was looted and destroyed, and the Sultan himself lost everything he had, His Majesty’s Government realised that then* commercial and political interests in Maskat were such that they could not afford to see the incident repeated. The Sheikhs of Oman were, therefore, informed that in future the British Government would not permit Maskat or Matra to be attacked. That is the present positi on, and the intimation to the Sheikhs of Oman has proved quite sufficient hitherto so far as Maskat is con- cerned. Couid not the present opportunity be used to inform the Oman public that the above policy will be extended in future to all ports in Oman Wx eie ar e communities of British traders, and consequently British inter- ests We have every reasonable ground for assuming such an attitude as it is m the interests of all peaceable traders alike, whether they be British or native.

I cannot but be anxious for the safety of our subjects at the ports of ,! e ^ a tineh Coast, and have arranged for a man-of-war to remain here for the present;-but if the tribes had been informed in the sense that I now sug- gos , ey would accept the intimation, and the danger of trouble to our sub jects would be very much less. It might even be possible to go beyond the limits of the above intimation, but 1 am less confident on the latter point, which I will now explain.3 2 You are aware that in former days the Rulers of Oman exercised spiritual as well as temporal powers and were styled “ Imam Since the days of Ahmed-bin-Saeed no successor has been considered to possess the spiritual quali fications'necessary to justify that title, and the descendants of Ahmed-bin- Saeed hare been known to their subjects simply as “ S/Vyids ”, and to us as ‘‘Sultans ”, a term never used by Omanis. Whenever some firebrand arises like the late Saleh-bin-Ali, and now his son Aysa, they can always rouse a cer tain section of the population by the statement or pretence that they are goim? to set up an ‘‘ Imam” to be their spiritual ruler in opposition to the Spi^yid *. As a rule, these attempts are abortive and there is no practical result, but this shibboleth, the “ making of an Imam ”, works wonders in the way of unrest and excitement among the ignorant tribesmen of the interior. Similarly, the present troubles may not have any serious result, but in any case they are causing a good deal of anxiety and are having an injurious effect upon the date export industry, upon which the prosperity of Maskat entirely depends. When the Viceroy visits Maskat, he will thus'have ready tckhand a fresh case in point, and I believe it would have a sobering effect upon the turbulent Bedouin element, and would take the wind out of the sails of such troublesome characters as Aysa-bin-Saleh and Hilal-bin-Amir, if the Viceroy could make a statement to the Durbaris somewhat on the following lines. After, sketching the position which Great Britain has taken for generations in preserving the peace and prosperity of the Gulf, His Excellency would explain— That the British Government is only interested in what goes on in the interior of Oman in so far as passing events affect British trading interests, which are, however, very considerable. That it is found that mischievous ris ings against the constituted authority of the Sultan, caused by no acts of op pression on the part of the Euler, but merely got up with the object of extort ing blackmail from hi/ or causing annoyance and unrest, do seriously affect the trade of the ports and the interests of British merchants, and that whereas the stock of S//yid Turki and his forebears have been on terms of close intimacy and treaty relation with the British Government, and his descendants still are, the British Government thinks that the time has come to make it known to the public of Oman that, as long as the descendants of Sd/yid Turki continue to act up to their treaty engagements to that Government and to conduct their ad ministration in a manner compatible with the advancing requirements of civili sation, .His Majesty’s Government will be prepared, should it see fit, to protect its subjects and interests in Oman and to support the authority of the Sultan in any way that may seem expedient, and to assist him by such means, as may appear called for, to suppress those disloyal and unruly subjects who are the enemies as well of the public weal as of the ruling Sultan. Such an intimation need not commit us in any way as between ourselves and the Sultan, but would be very generally welcomed by the peaceable por tion of the community and would strengthen the Sultan’s hands a good deal. I do not see what excejation the Erench could take to it, and I should think they would hardly be inclined to at the present time. Telegram, dated the 19th September 1903.

So far as the Trucial Chiefs are concerned, I do not think it is necessary or desirable to enter into any new form of engagement. Our influence with these Chiefs is already predominant, the maritime peace is ensured, intrigues with [Foreign Powers provided against, and the trade practically in our hands and, so far as I can foresee, likely to remain so. Prom our point of view I think we may he fairly content with the status quo; whether it would be advisable looking to the future to modify or expand this status quo is not very easy to say. Our time-hcnoured policy has been, as you know, to maintain the martime peace and not to interfere in the internal quarrels of the Chiefs. As a matter of fact, the result of our policy has been to prevent aggression by one Chief on another. But this may not always be the case ; some of the Chiefs are grow ing powerful, and others are perhaps getting weaker, and a spirit of aggression may arise. The Chief of Debaye, for instance, might wish to try conclusions with his neighbour at Shargah. Probably the [Resident would get sufficient warning of the likelihood of hostilities to enable him to stop the fighting, though this would be contrary to our traditional policy. It really would not matter very much from our point of view, so far as I can see, whether the stronger and wiser ruler at Debaye laid his hands on Shargah or not, but of course a period of unrest would follow, and our trade interests might suffer. It might therefore be [advisable to let the Chiefs know that aggression by one independent Chief on another independent Chief would not be viewed with approval by us. Such a warning will, I think, he quite sufficient, and, though perhaps not immediately necessary, it might be a useful safe guard for the future peace of the coast. No special engagement to this end would be required. The Viceroy at the Durbar might I venture to suggest, after alluding to the benefits which have resulted to the Chiefs and their country from the peace which has been consequent on their engagements with the British Government, inform them that the Govern ment intends to maintain its interest in them for their own benefit and for the continuance of their independence. His Excellency is pleased to learn that the engagements have, as a rule, been faithfully observed, and he is confident that the same faithful observance will he maintained in the future. The British Government has no desire to interfere in their internal affairs so far as the Chiefs govern their territories with justice and respect the rights of the foreign traders residing therein. All that the British Government desires is that the status quo should be maintained, and any aggression by one State on another, even although the operations may be confined to land, will not be viewed with approval by the British Government. In any case of dispute between the Chiefs the British Resident is always ready to listen to complaints and to arrange an amicable settlement satisfactory to both parties. Such is a brief outline of what in my opinion might be said at the Durbar if the expansion of the status quo to this extent is approved. Whether the Chiefs themselves will desire anything more I cannot say. I do not think so, but I intend to visit the coast shortly, and will be able to let you know if such is the case. ******* Extract from a letter from Lieutenant~Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, dated Bushire, the 8th Octobtr 1903. ******* Now as to the political aspect of the visit to Bahrein, the status of Bahrein is well known to the Government of India, and it is not necessary for me to enter into the details of it now. The Chief of Bahrein will, I feel sure, have no desire for any new form of engagement to be concluded with him. All that he wants is to be left alone and to be allowed to end his days iu peace. Any4 expansion or modification of the quo, which would tend to curtail the Chief’s authority in any way and make our protectorate more apparent, would, I feel sure, he against the Sheikh’s wishes. He has now all he wants. He is protected against attack ; his son’s succession has been assured ; and, so far as the internal administration of his inlands are concerned, he is virtually independent, subject of course to the benevolent supervision of the Assistant Political Agent. I am inclined, however, to think that the time has now come when the expan sion of the status quo is desirable from our point of view, however much such an expansion may be distasteful to the Chief. Bahrein of recent years seeny^ to have attracted more attention on the part of the foreigners, and I consider that we should take some steps to make our protectorate more apparent. The most suitable way of doing this will be, in my opinion, to put the Customs question on a more satisfactory footing. We have, I consider, ample grounds for taking such a step. The maintenance of the Chief’s independence is/solely dua to us, and now that we have promised to recognise the succession of his eldestfson, we have become to a certain extent the gWrdian of the interests of this son, and are, I consider, fully justified in trying to secure for this son, as far as possible, a prosperous and unembarrassed succession. The present Chief’s affairs are in anything but a satisfactory condition, and are bound, so far as I can see, to go from bad to worse. He has many people dependent on him for support, and the number of these will gradually increase : moreover, he has the usual extravagant ideas of hospitality of which full advantage is taken. The conse quence is that he is generally hard put to it to provide himself with funds, and as you are aware, he has had to farm his Customs for some years ahead in. order to provide himself with money fp^i his current expense. The Hindu Customs farmers have, of course, taken full advantage of the position and are reaping large profits, which, if the Chief were a sensible man, ought to go into his own pockets. It is useless to argue with him in,this matter : he is satisfied with matters as they are, and the fact that his son will succeed to an embarrassed property does not trouble him in any way; “ after me the deluge ” is his motto; all he wants is to be left in peace for the remaining years of his life, and he trusts to fate and the British Government to arrange matters after his death. This, in my opinion, is fair to no one, and I think that the Chief should now be told that the system of farming his Customs does not commend itself to the Government of India and must be changed. There is no desire to curtail the Chief’s independence in any way; all we want to see is that the Chief himself should be relieved from his difficulties, and that the affairs of his State should not be embarrassed when his son succeeds him. We have no desire to take over the management of his Customs : this will remain in the Chief’s hand as heretofore. All jthat is desired is that the Customs should be efficiently managed in the interests of the Chief himself and of trade generally. As the Chief has no one who is sufficiently conversant with Customs matters, we desire to lend him the services of a trained Customs officer, who will reorganise the department for him, and be under his orders generally so far as the manage ment of the department is concerned. This is not the place to enter into details of the scheme which will, of course, have to be dealt with officially, and which will, I feel confident, present no insuperable difficulties, if the .Chief’s sentimental objection that his inde pendence is being aimed at is disregarded, as it may, in my opinion, very fairly be. Sooner or later the change must be made, and although, from motives of personal regard for the Chief, I would prefer that his inclinations should not be so directly opposed and that the change should come after his death, still, for all we know, he is good for another twenty years of life, and I am satisfied that early steps in the matter should be taken both from consider ations of the political situations at Bahrein and of the future welfare of the islands. With the Customs virtually in our hands, that is to say, managed by us for the Chief’s benefit, we should be able to remove various incon- veniences^uch as, for instance, the high transhipment fees, we should gain more knowledge of the trade situation, and we should make our protectorate clear to the Turks and to the world at large. It is possible that it may not he deemed necessary or advisable that this matter should be brought forward during the Viceroy’s visit. I have, however, considered it necessary to place my views before you, as you have asked me to indicate whether any1 ■ - # modification or expansion of the stattis quo is desirable. A clear direction to the Chief in this matter and the consequent change in the management of the Customs is, of course, a very distinct modification of the status quo as. being a direct interference by us in the municipal affairs of the islands, but it is at the same time, I feel sure, the best solution for British interests and. for the matter of that for the interests of Bahrein as well. Probably the.Chief, if he is permitted to do so, will wish to mention certain matters to the Viceroy, such as the murder of his relative, Sheikh SeU^jfi-bin-Diaij, his desire to arm a boat to pursue parties, and the succession of his eldest son. If he brings forward this latter matter, the opportunity may, perhaps, be taken to renew the promise which has been made regarding his son’s succession, and to inform the Chief that, in view of this and past favours shown to the Chief by the British Gov ernment, the Chief on his part is expected not to be remiss in accepting the '^dyjce which if offered to-him in matters which are really for his own benefit. The Viceroy is aware that the Chief’s finances are not as satisfactory as they might be, and that these might readily be ameliorated by an improvement in the Customs management which would secure for the Chief’s own requirements and for the needs of his Government. His Excellency, therefore, trusts that the Chief will listen to such advice as the Besident may be instructed to give him in this connection. The political situation at Koweit is well known, and I find it difficult to make any suggestions as to the modification or expansion of the status quo which will not be, I believe], under the circumstances, feasible. At any rate I take it that it will be useless for the Sheikh to make any request for the expansion of the protectorate which is probably what he would like to see.Ma&amp;kat Trade Statistics for 1895 to 1902.

It ms eventually decided that protection should be accorded to that portion of the colony which had migrated from Sind after it became a part of British India, and this proportion of the community and their descendants have since continued to be regarded as British subjects* V/^' STr—C f Their religious tenets are somewhat peculiar and involved.

Assistant Surgeon Bogle was the first iritis! Agent appointed in pursuance of the above requests in 1800.

His eldest son Tairaoor is by ills Highness»s c ilef wife Aleyyah, daughter of Seyyid Thoweytjee and therefore first cousin of the Sultan. He Is 1? years of age* The Productions and Commerce of Muscat* Half a century ago Muscat used to be a much more thriving place than it is at the present day. It was in fact the distribu ting centre for the whole of the trade of the Gulf and within the memory of inhabitants still living as many as 40 clipper sailing ships have been seen at anchor in Muscat harbour at one time. -any of the owners of these vessels were very wealthy and resided in comparatively palatial buildings in the suburbs of Muscat and Tatra which have since crumbled to ruin. From the/ time that steam vessels began to ply to these waters the prosperity of iuscat 1ms gradually waned* PRODUCTIONS* The chief exports are Dates, Fruit, Fish, Limes and Pomegranates.

Part of it he recovered hy a punitive tax on the rebel tribes and the balance was deducted from the arrears of his subsidy which had been suspended* 1899 In September of this year Muscat was visited by a severe epidemic of Cholera which quickly spread to the interior* About 700 persons were carried off in Muscat and 'atra and upwards of 120,000 in Oman. ITo such epidemic had occurred since 1825* 1900 Hardly had the Cholera subsided when Muscat had a visita tion of Bubonic Plague. Fortunately the epidemic was not a severe one and did not spread to the interior, and both before and after since this visitation Muscat 1ms been fortunate in the immunity which it has enjoyed from this disease, considering its close proximity to and constant co: munication with India. During this year the Sultan decided to take the Customs Administration into his own hands instead of farming it out as hitherto, to local merchants. This measure has resulted in a decided increase of revenue to the Sultan himself and in several improve ments in the local arrangements for the safe landing and storage of goods. The Customs Superintendent has a somewhat difficult card to play, because naturally the Banian element who used to make large profits out of the farm do not look upon the present regime with favour, and are not slow to find fault. On the whole the Customs Superintendent however seems to me to have tore good work and during the last three years considerable extensions hnd improvements have taken place in the Wharf and Customs House premises which cannot fail to strike any one who remembers Muscat a few years ago. Tie Sultan is anxious to provide still further facilities for the landing and shipping of merchandise by the erection of a petty running out from the Customs Wharf, but this is an ex ensive undertaking which he is not at present in a position to embark upon unless he can be allowed to recover whole or part of the cost by a small increase in Customs duty. 1901 On the 4th October the Sultan’s old and valued servant the VasterVazier Hejyid Saed died very suddenly fro T -’ an aneurism of the heart. / lie was by far the most enlightened roan living amongst the Sultan's retainers in regard to all matters of policy and had strong Anglo philia feelings which were often useful to the Political Agent. The Sultan had been unable to replace him. His present nominal Vazier is a venerable dotard whom it is impossible for the Sultan or foreign Consuls to do any serious business with. In Hovember 1901 the Telegraph Cable was extended from Jaste to Muscat and the custom accorded to fcfegt. telegraph office seems to have more than come up to expectations. In the same year Government authorised the purchase of Shett Ruttonset Purshotarn’s premises in order to provide accomodation for the Clerks of the Consular and Telegraph offices and a residence for the Agency Surgeon. The site is a desirable one on the sea face and the build ings designed are now in course of erection. 1902 In January of this year a slaving fleet of 12 Arab Ohows was surprised and captured by a Portuguese man-of-war and 725 slaves released. About 150 of the Arab Slav ra were taken prisoners and all proved to hail from Oman and mostly from Hoor. About 20 have died in captivity and the remainder have been awarded the exemplary sentence of 25 years confinement on the west coast of Africa. In December in response to the invitation of the G-overnment of India His Highness the Hultin sent his sea Seyyid Taimoor and 2 companions to represent him at the Delhi Durbar, where they were received with disti notion by the Government of India and returned after a short tour in India much impressed with what they had seen.\ ( ^6) 1 1 1 &gt; 'mS-S F It/ •35S [External Branch.] Notes on certain current topics prepared for reference during His Excellency the Viceroy’s tour in the Persian Gulf, November 1903. ■ IX D LIST OP NOTES PREPARED POR REFERENCE IN THE PERSIAN GULP.

It was suggested— (1) that the French Government should he asked to agree to the pro hibition by the Sultan of Maskat of all importation of arms and ammunition into his dominions; (2) that the Porte should be moved to permit vessels under the Turkish flag to be searched for arms by British ships of war; or, failing this, that they should formally notify to His Majesty’s Govern^ ment that the importation of arms into the Ottoman dominions without special license is prohibited; (3) that the rules of June 1898, placing certain restrictions on the possession of arms by British subjects in Oman, should be cancelled. On the 3rd November 1903, the Secretary of State telegraphed that Sir N. O’Conor had been instructed to obtain from the Porte a formal Notifica tion in the sense of the alternative suggestion in (2) above; and that until the views of the French Government had been ascertained, no action should be taken at present on (3). As regards (1) it appears from a letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office, dated the 28th August 1903, that Lord George Hamilton agreed as to the desirability of the suggested agreement with France, but did not desire to press it.

Maskat, under the orders of His Majesty’s Government, was directed to move the Sultan to issue notifications declaring illegal the exportation of arms and ammunition to the portions of the African Coast and islands, including Socotra, lying to the north of Cape Guardafui which are under the British Protectorate, and also to those parts of the African Coast which are under the Italian Protectorate, and further authorising the seizure in Maskat territorial waters and in Maskat dhows on the high seas of Hrms or ammunition consigned to the above-mentioned territories in contraven tion of the said notifications. Telegram to the Political Agent at Maskat, No. 2472 E.-A., dated the 15th October 1903. The Sultan was also to be invited to issue notifications empowering British and Italian ships of war to deal with suspected Maskat dhows in the territorial waters of Oman and on the high seas; and steps were then to be taken under the Maskat Order in Council to make both notifications binding on British subjects. On the 20th October, Major Cox forwarded a copy of the notification Letter from the Political Agent at Maskat, No. 57s, issued by the Sultan, and intimated that dated the zoth October 1903 . ma( Je it applicable to British subjects by a brief parallel notice.?ormgn Office Pren—No. 1393-4-11-03—30, CONSTRUCTION OP A COALING PIER AT MASKAT.

'Telegram to the Political Agent at Maskat, No. 2323 E.-A., dated the 1st October 1903. With a view to improving the coaling arrangements at Maskat, the Government of India in June 1902 sanctioned the construction of a stone pier at the coal depot in the Maculla cove at an estimated cost of Rs 3,000. This sum was at the time not thought sufficient, but Major Cox , was allowed to build as great a length of pier as could be completed within the amount allowed. A further sum of Rs. 8,654 has now been sanctioned to complete the work. On the 12th June 1902, Major Cox was informed that the Naval Commander-in-Chief No. 86 in External A, July 1902, Nos. 84-87. _ suggested that, in order to provide better -m- - , , , . ... , * ’ facilities for communication between His Majesty s ships and the shore, at low tide or in bad weather, a small jetty should be built in front of the British Consulate at Maskat, and he was asked to report on the suggestion. On the 6th July 1903, Major Cox replied that it was impracticable to maintain a jetty Letter from the PoUtica!

In connection with disturbances in the neighbourhood of Rostak headed by Aysa-bin-Saleh, Letter from the Political Agent at Maskat, No. 434, the Sultan of Maskat informed Major Cox on dated the 24th August 1903. the 23rd August that he feared he might be Telegram to the Political Agent at Maskat, No. obliged to ask for an advance of Rs. 20,000 2116 E.-A., dated the 7th September 1903. to be repaid by monthly deductions from his Telegram to the Political Resident in the Persian subsidy. The Government of India sanctioned Gulf, No. 2118 E.-A., dated the 7th September 1903. advance In recommending the grant of the loan, Major Cox had suggested that the opportunity might be taken to address the Sultan upon the manner in which His Highness's finances are conducted. Colonel Kemball was consulted on this proposal, and, on the 12th September Letter from the Political Resident in the Persian reported that the only suggestions which Gulf, No. 22 S.A., dated the 12th September 1903. Major Cox could make were (i) that a British. Customs official might be deputed to Gwadur to examine certain difficulties which had arisen in connection with the Customs at that port, and (ii) that a punchayet from the local mercantile community should be appointed for the purpose of periodically auditing the Maskat Customs accounts in the interests of the Sultan himself. Colonel Kemball asked that the consideration of these proposals might be postponed until he had an opportunity of meeting Major Cox and discussing the question with Letter to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, him. On the 4th of October, he was informed No. 2365 E.-A., dated the 5th October 1903. ’ that the result of his discussion would be awaited. On the same day (4th October), Major Cox reported that, on the 29th September, the Letter from the Political Agent at Maskat, No. 534, money had been paid to the Sultan, who had dated the 4th October 1903. . been induced to agree to the deputation of a Government^ Customs official to Gwadur to examine the situation, and to devise a settlement acceptable alike to His Highness and to the British merchants should Government desire such a course in the event of the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, and Major Cox being unable to arrange the matter without troubling Government.

INTER-TRIBAL DISSENSIONS IN OMAN. Since August 1903 the proceedings of Aysa-bin-Saleh and his brothers have given the Sultan considerable trouble. In September news was received that Aysa had possessed himself of Rostak Eort (some 85 miles W. S. W. from Maskat), and had induced the Sultan’s brother-in-law, Saeed-bin-Ibrahim, to join him. Indications were received that the latter would be proclaimed Imam; but his character made it doubtful whether he would procure recog nition in this role. An attack made by the Sultan’s son, Saiyid Timur, on Hazam, the home of Saeed-bin-Ibrahim, was repulsed; the whole country be tween Rostak and the sea was in a disturbed condition; and the Sultan was put to a heavy expenditure in holding Mesnaa, Burka, Seeb, and other points on the coast. Later reports received in October indicated that the country was quieter; most of Aysa-bin-Saleh’s men had left Rostak, but Aysa himself was still there. Saeed-bin-Ibrahim had addressed the Sultan, asking for the renewal of the monthly stipend which the Sultan ordinarily allows him; but His High ness had replied that no payment would be made so long as Aysa-bin-Saleh remained at Rostak. The Sultan was hopeful that there would be no further trouble. Major Cox was less sanguine. C. L. S. Russell, —8-11-03. S. M.

At the Sultan’s desire Major Cox arranged with the Commander of the “ Perseus” to send a steam-cutter in pursuit of the men, who were eventually arrested, tried, and imprisoned. The French Consul demanded the release of the men, but the demand was refused. The matter was then taken up in London by the French Ambassador. 240 - 383 333 in Secret E ' September 1903 &gt; Nos - After discussion in Cabinet, Lord Lans- rp , downe proposed a reference to the Hague iribunai on the general question of the privileges conferred by the French flag and papers, and added that, if the proposal were accepted, His Majesty’s Govern ment would advise the Sultan to release the prisoners of his own accord. On No. 342 , 26th May, the Secretary of State tele- , , -p . T . graphed that the French Government had formally accepted Lord Lansdowne’s proposals. His Majesty’s Government had undertaken to advise the Sultan to release the three prisoners, while the Trench Government had agreed to refer forthwith to the Hague Tribunal the whole question of their right to give flags to the subjects of the Sultan, and of e nature and extent of the privileges and immunities which the grant of such flags can confer; and furthermore, pending the decision of the Tribunal, to furnish a list of those who hold French flags, and to grant no more. The terms arranged were communicated to the Sultan, who released the three prisoners and sent them back to Sur, informing the French Vice-Consul of his action. On the 29th July, in reply to enquiries made by the Sultan, the Secretary No. 382, ibid. ^ State telegraphed that Major Cox might , - , ... „ inform His Highness that the arrange ments for the submission of the French flag question to the Tribunal had made some progress, and that the question of the privileges enjoyed by the French flag-holders would be argued before the Tribunal by the British Government on behalf of the Sultan, but that His Majesty’s Government would welcome the assistance of any person whom the Sultan might depute to supply inform ation and offer suggestions.

In July 1901, the Political Agent at Maskat reported that the Sultan had External a, January 1902, Nos. 6-ii (enclosure mentioned a wish to impose a prohibitive to Pro.

Such duty was not to apply to wines and spirits, such as port and whisky, ordinarily imported by the dozen for consumption of Europeans, &amp;c., but only to the cheap quality of rectified spirits imported chiefly from Grermany, doctored in the bazaars, and sold at 4 annas a quart bottle. The Government of India pointed out that the imposition of a prohibitive import duty on any kind of merchandise, or the introduction by His Highness of any merchandise after importation, was precluded by the terms not only of the British Treaty * of 1891 and the French Treaty $ of 1844, hut also of the American Treaty f of 1833. The Government of India, however, were anxious to assist the Sultan in his difficulty, declared that they would place no obstacle in the way, and directed that the Sultan should be advised to approach the Consular representatives of the French and United States Governments on the subject. On the 14th November 1902, § Major Cox reported that the Sultan had § Enclosure, Pro.

Major Cox requested permission to issue rules to this effect which should be binding on British subjects.

The Government of India in reply pointed outf that the levy of such a duty practically amounted to the imposition of an export duty. They allowed the tax, however, so long as it was “reasonably low”. 2. In 1898, Major Eagan enquired^: whether the above orders still held good, J External A, May 1899, Nos. 1-12 (Pro.

Early in 1899, the ultimatum in connection with the Bunder Jisseh § Secret e., February 1899, Nos. 90-189 (Pro. incident was delivered to the Sultan,§ and No ' l74) ' in clause 9, paragraph 4, of this document a demand was made for the reduction of all import duties to the rate of 5 per cent ad valorem, and the reduction to 5 per cent of the tax on dates brought from the interior for exportation. 3. In June[| 1903 the Sultan addressed the British Consul informing him that he intended levying a duty of 2 per cent as “ zakat ” over and above the 5 per cent usually levied on dates. Major Cox in referring^ the question to the Govern ment of India reported that in the preceding year the Sultan had levied an extra duty of 1 per cent on all dates coming into Maskat. The British Indian merchants did not then complain of this extra impost as they did not think it would be to their interests to do so. When, however, the Sultan expressed his intention to increase the levy to 2 per cent, the merchants represented to the British Consul that it would affect them injuriously. The Government of India replied** to Major Cox that the impost seemed ** (Pro.

XX md. (Pro. No. 32 ). The Sultan was informed^ of this ruling. On the 26th September 1903, Major Cox submitted a further report on the subject, pointing out that “ zakat ” was regularly levied at certain ports in addition to the export duty. No ground appears, however, to have been shown for modifying the orders §§ of the 21st July 1903. C. L. S. Russell, —11-11-03. §§ External A, September 1903, No. 30.

Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—L. W. Dane, Esq., I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. Your telegram of the 20th instant reached me just as I was embarking on the “ Lawrence *’ for Koweit, Bahrein and the Arab Coast and I was unable, therefore, to despatch the short narratives which you ask for, until my return to Bushire this morning. I hope the narratives which I now submit will do. Few events of political importance have occurred on this coast for many years past; the numerous petty intertribal squabbles which have occurred would require space and could hardly he included in a short narrative. It is almost impossible to form an accurate estimate of the populations of the various places. The various esti mates on record are very discrepant. My estimates are based on a recent report from our Agent at Shargah corrected in accordance with such informa tion as I have been able to collect on the spot. ABU DHABI. The Chief of this place is Sheikh Zaid bin Khalifa of the Beniyas tribe. This tribe originally came from Nejd and was a Bedouin tribe. The town of Abu Dhabi was founded about 1761 A. D. Some members of the Beniyas tribe, which after its migration from Nejd had its habitation in the country between Biddah and Brymee, being reduced to poverty by the loss of their cattle took up their abode on the Coast between Debaye and the spot where Abu Dhabi now stands. Water, the existence of which in this part was not previously known, being found, the first establishment which consisted of 20 houses took place, and in two years time the place had increased to 200 houses. The first Chief, who appears to have established his authority over the whole of the Beniyas tribe, was Zheab bin Isa who did so by putting to death his uncle Zaid bin Mahomed Sheikh Zheab was murdered in 1793 by Ids cousin Huza bin Zaid and was succeeded by Shakboot. Sheikh Shakboot bin Zheab held the Chief ship until 1816, when he was deposed by his son Mohamed. In 1818, Mohamed was deposed by his younger brother Tahnoon, who ruled as Chief uutil 1833, when he was murdered by his brothers Khaleefa and Sultan. Sheikh Khaleefa succeeded and being murdered in 1845 was suc ceeded by his nephew Syeed bin Tahnoon. Sheikh Syeed bin Tahnoon was * See poitcript. ^j 11 ^ in % hfc h J cousin Sheikh Zaid bin* Khaleefa who is the present Chief. He was born about 1836 and has eight sons living. Sheikh Zaid’s personal influence is great throughout the countryside and his authority is greater and his position more important than that of the other Trucial Chiefs. He receives a salute of 5 guns, none of the other Chiefs receiving more than 3 guns, and his visit alone is returned by the Resident. He is of a somewhat ambitious and intriguing nature but it cannot be said that he gives any especial trouble to the Political authorities in the Persian Gulf. He is a wise and experienced Chief and I have generally found him amenable to reason. Our first connection with the Beniyas tribe was in 1820, when they were admitted members of the general Treaty concluded with the maritime tribes in 1820. The Chief of the Beniyas was a subscriber to the Perpetual Treaty of Peace of 1853. In 1847 he entered into an engagement in common with the other Trucial Chiefs, bavin? for its object the abolition of the African Slave Trade. In 1892, Sheikh Zaid bin Khaleefa became a party to the Agree ment by which the Trucial Chiefs engaged on no account to correspond with or make Agreements with other Powers, to receive no Agent of any other Government and on no account to cede, mortgage or otherwise give for occupa tion any part of their territories save to the British Government.It is difficult to say what the population of Abu Dhabi is, but the town itself may have a fluctuating population of not less than 4,000. 1 e ne s territories extend inland almost as far as Brymee, and his subjects an epen dents including the townsfolk of Abu Dhabi may amount to between ve an six thousand. Besides this he may have some 5,000 Bedouins who owe allegiance but pay no tribute. There are some 50 Hindu traders li v i^ a t u Dhabi. Most of the inhabitants of Abu Dhabi live by pearl fishing, a e growing and camel transport. The only recent event of any importance in the history of Abu Dhabi, is the intrigue which was got up in 1899 between the Darya Begi, the Persian Governor of Bushire, and Sheikh Zaid bin Khaleefa, having for its appaient object the separation of the Abu Dhabi Chief from the other Trucial Chiefs. The outward signs of this intrigue were the adoption of a special flag by the Chief of Abu Dhabi and a firman and presents from the Shah and Darya Begi. The Chief was made to revert to his former flag and his apology in regard to the other matter was accepted. Since then nothing of any particular impor- tance has occurred as regards the Chief of Abu Dhabi. C. A. KEMBALL, Lieut.-Col, Offg. Folitical Resident in the Fersicm Gulf. F S. —I have not been able to ascertain from my records the exact date of Shaikh Zaid’s succession. It appears that it was in 1855 that he ousted Shaikh Syeed bin Tahnoon. My records do not show that Shaikh Syeed was. killed by Shaikh Zaid but I was informed by the Chief of Bahrein who is well up in all matters pertaining to the Chiefs on the Arab Coast that this was the case. DEBATE. The present Chief is Sheikh Makhtoom bin Hashar of A1 bu Falasah tribe. This tribe is a branch of the Beniyas and seceded from Abu Dhabi in 1834. Sheikh Makhtoom bin Hashar succeeded bis uncle Rashid bin Makhtoom on the latter’s death in 1894. The succession was brought about peaceably though Rashid bin Makhtoom had six sons, three of whom were of age. Nothing of any particular importance has occurred at Debaye of recent years. The Chief, Sheikh Makhtoom bin Hashar, appears to be the most in telligent of the Trucial Chiefs and his town is fast increasing in importance and will soon, it is believed, be the most important place, from a trade point of view, on the coast. Steamers of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company call there regularly and it is gradually supplanting Lin^ah as the entrepot for goods for the Arab Coast. The town may have some 3,000 or 4,000 inhabitants. There a^e between 50 and 60 British Indian subjects, Hindus and Khojahs, living in the place The people are almost entirely engaged in pearl fishing.

KEMBALL, Lieut.-Col., Offy* Folitical Resident in the Fersian Gulf.Shargah and Has ul Kheima. These two places are now united under the Chief of Shargah, the head of the well known Joasmi tribe. The present Chief is Sheikh Suggar Lin Khalid. It is unnecessary, I think, to enter into a full account of the history of these two places showing how they became separated under different rulers. Suffice it to say that after the death of the well known Sheikh Sultan bin Suggar in 1866 at the age of 115, his son Ibrahim took charge of Has ul Kheima 5 , while his son Khalid was given Shargah. As a result of the fighting which broke out immediately Ibrahim was ousted by Khalid who however was killed in 1868 in single combat by the Chief of Abu Dhabi who had joined the coalition of the various Arab tribes for the purpose of reinstating Ibrahim. Khalid was succeeded by his younger brother Salim while Humeid bin Abdulla bin Sultan nephew to Khalid and his deputy at Ras ul Kheima was elected Chief of the latter place in preference to Ibrahim who was not accept able to the inhabitants Humeid was strong enough to throw off his allegiance to Shargah and Ras ul Kheima remained independent until Humeid’s '’death in 1900, when Sheikh Suggar bin Khalid who had ousted his uncle Salim and became Chief of Sharg^h in 1883, seized Ras ul Kheima without any serious opposition. Sheikh Suggar’s son Khalid is now in charge at Ras ul Kheima. The territories of the Joasmi Chief are fairly extensive and include the strip along the Batineh Coast. The population of Shargah may be about 4,000 and of Ras ul Kheima about 1,500. There are some 70 British subjects, Hindus and Khojahs, residing at Shargah and at Ras ul Kheima some 9 or id Hyderabadis. Pearl diving is the principal occupation. Sheikh Suggar is about 40 years of age. He appears to be generally un popular amongst the other Trucial Chiefs and is not apparently a wise ruler There is nothing especial to record with regard to Joasmi affairs* of recent years, beyond the trouble which the Chief is now haying with his feudatory at Fujei- rah on the Batineh Coast. Ihe Joasmi Chief is of course a subscriber to the- Perpetual Treaty of Peace of 1853 and to the other engagements with the British Government. Sheikh Suggar gets a salute of 3 guns. C. A.

It was proposed to re-occunv Hen jam where a station of the Indo-European Telegraph Department was located from 1869 to 1881—land one of the Gulf cables on the island, establish a lelegraph Office, and connect thence with Bunder Abbas. The estimate for tlie most costly of three schemes suggested was £18,539. His Majesty’s Gov ernment were asked to share the expenditure. J In a despatch!

On § No. 7 . fr 16 frh August, therefore, the Viceroy ,. , telegraphed§ to the Secretary of State, suggesting that Bassidore, where our rights were incontestable, might be preferable as a site for a telegraph station, a cable running thence via Clarence Straits to Bunder Abbas. On the 28th October the Secretary of State telegraphed|| that the II No. is. Admiralty agreed that Bassidore was , r preferable to Henjam. The Treasury declined, however to share the cost; and Mr. Brodrick enquired whether the Government of India still desired to proceed with the project in whole or part. C. L. S. Russell, —9-11-03. S.

Owing to an article which appeared in the “ Times of India” regarding the want of proper accommodation for the Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas, the Secret e., July 1903 , Nos. 146-172 (No. 146 ) Secretary of State for India called for a report upon the steps which had been taken to provide a suitable house and furniture for the Vice-Consulate. Messrs. Herman &amp; Co., a firm of contractors at Karachi, were accordingly ind (No. 153 ). asked, in November 1902, for plans and estimates for a Vice-Consulate and certain other buildings, the sum of Rs. 25,000 being mentioned as the amount the Government of India were willing to expend. This firm submitted plans and estimates amounting to over Rs. 98,000, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, after consulting the Vice-Consul, has requested him to ask Messrs. Herman &amp; Co. to submit revised estimates in accordance with the suggested limit of Rs. 25,000, though he believed it would be difficult to construct the Vice-Consulate within this sum. Copies of the plans and estimates* were subsequently received by the * Amounting to Es. 98 , 160 . Government of India, and sent by the n 4 V lono 4 4 ! a • , p ! lbl . ic Works Department, on the 13th October 1902, to the Superintending Engineer, Indus Right Bank, from whom a criticism is awaited. It may be noted in this connection that the Bombay Government have with the approval of the Government of India, decided to depute an Executive Engineer, Mr. Corbett, to report on the new Residency buildings at Baghdad. Mr. Corbett is expected to leave Bombay about the 1st November and to'return some time in January. It has been suggested that Mr. Corbett might call at Bunder Abbas on his return journey, if by that time the case has reached a stage at which local enquiry by an Engineer would be of any value Foreign Office Press—No. 1390-4-11-03—30.JURISDICTION OF THE VICE-CONSUL AT BUNDER ABBAS. The question of extending the Consular jurisdiction of the Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas js under consideration. At present the case stands as follows : In June 1901, we communicated* to the Secretary of State the suggestion of the Political * No. 169 in Secret E., August 1901, Nos. 130-170. Resident in the Persian Gulf that the jurisdic- * i jj-r-i . it jvj, ^ on Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas, which included Bunder Abbas and Vezd, should he extended to Lingah ; and we added a suggestion tat it should include Lanstan, and that the Consular jurisdiction of the Political Resident nimselt should be extended to the provinces of Laristan and Yezd. In reply, the Secretary of t Secret E., January 1902, Nos. 60-53. State sentf us correspondence with the Foreign , , m . Office, which showed that His Majesty’s Minis- ter at Tehran saw no objection to placing Laristan and Yezd within the Consular jurisdiction of the Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas, and that he agreed to Laristan being included in the Consular district of the Political Resident, but considered that Yezd should remain under the Consul-General of Isfahan. The Viceroy agreed to the modification proposed in regard to J No. 53, IJid. Yezd. With his despatch j of the 13th December 1901, the Secretary of State for warded a letter from the Foreign Office which stated that an amended Commission would be issued forthwith to the Consul-General at Bushire, extending his jurisdiction to the provinces of Laristan and Lingah, and that steps would be taken to carry out the other proposed change as soon as a successor was appointed to Lieutenant Hunt. In view of the temporary nature of Captain Grey's appointment at Bunder Abbas, it was not considered necessary to move further m the matter when he took up the post. As Captain Grey is now likely to remain on there, it was considered advisable again to take up the question, and during his recent visit to Simla, it was suggested to him that he might address the Resident regarding the extension of his jurisdiction. Subsequently, on the 30th September 1903, we wrote demi-officially to Colonel Kemball, suggesting that the Vice-Consul's jurisdiction might well be extended to include all the Persian islands in the east of the Gulf with Lingah, and perhaps Ja|k; and that, in order to emphasise the fact that Ras Mussandim, Elphinstone Inlet, the Batineh Coast between Dibba and Khor Kalba, and the hinterland behind the territories of the Trucial Chiefs are not under Maskat, these parts might be placed under the Assistant Resident at Bunder Abbas, who could also look to Abu Musa and Tamb, and be placed formally in charge of our station at Bassidore, arrangements being made from time to time for him to visit his jurisdiction in one of the three gun-boats to be detailed for the Gulf. An ad interim reply was received from Colonel Kemball on the 16th October 1903, stating Demi-official letter to Colouel C. A. Kemball, dated that he was inclined to agree to a certain extent the 30th September 1903. with the suggestions made, though he doubted if it would be necessary to extend Captain Grey's Consular jurisdiction beyond Lingah and certain parts of the hinterland of Bunder Abbas, other places might, he thought, be placed under his direct charge in accordance with the provi sions of the Order§ in Council. He promised § The reference, which is presumably to the “ Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1889”, is not clear. This order applies only to places within the dominions of the Shah of Persia. to write officially about the matter shortly. C. L. S. Russell, —4-11-03. S. M. Fraser,— 4-11-03. L. W. Dane,— 4-11-03.

Sir Williamf Cuningham, in reply, approved of the suggestion. Nothing, however, came of it. 8.

In December 1902 Colonel Kemball addressed the Government of India, Prom Lieutenant-Coionei Kembaii, c.i.e., Officiat- regarding a request preferred by the P ‘'““ °° 1 '' 167 ' S1 ! ei kh of Bahrein that he might be per- ... .. ... , . mitted to maintain an armed dhow for the protection of himself and his subjects against piracies. 2. The vicinity of Bahrein and the neighbouring coasts of El Hassa ^Pro.No.ssainrntemai^Augustisss.Nos. an- and El Katr have long been exposed ‘ . , , t0 P iratical outrages, and though the depredations are now fewer and less serious than formerly, yet they are still sufficiently numerous to form a standing menace to the peace of these waters. es* e™' No ' 68 in Secret E ” February 1900 ’ Nos - In 1899 and 1900 four ari d five cases, ... ., _ , respectively, were reported :* in 1901 there was complete immunity: but the year 1902 brought a further recrudescence, vide Colonel Kemball’s letterf of the 13th September 1902. 3. ~ t Secret E., November 1900, Nog. 61-69. The offenders m all cases appear to have come from the mainland. Where they have been residents of territories which are nominally subject to the Ottoman Porte, endeavours have been made to enlist the co-operation of 6 L 69 r °’ N °' 66 in Secret E '’ Noveniber 1900 &gt; Nos - ^ ie Turkish authorities, and in some in- op i ... stances^ punishments have been awarded to the offenders, and partial restoration of property has been obtained. Where the base of operations has been in El Katr, it has been found possible in certam cases to procure restitution by bringing pressure to bear through Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Tham, the leading Chief of that Peninsula. If, as has siy-Se.' N °' 526 in Secret E ‘ July 1902 * ICos - beeri Proposed,§ a protectorate treaty is ... concluded with this Chief, an improved position would resuR so far as his territories are concerned. The consolidation of the Sheikh s power, and the establishment of peace and order, would however, be gradual, and, in the meantime, the unsettled state of the tribes on this promontory, coupled with the unsatisfactory character of Turkish adminis tration m El Hassa, make it impossible to expect that, at any near date, these coasts will cease to provide a base for piratical operations, or that it will be the rule for such punishment to be meted out to marauders as will deter them from the repetition of their crimes. Preventive measures at sea are practically confined to those adopted by the British Government, and it cannot be said that these are at present entirely effective. 4. The adoption of active measures for the suppression of piracy has for long been a leading feature of our policy in all parts of the Persian Gulf. Apart from this, moreover, the Chief of Bahrein has special claims upon us for the protection of himself and his subjects by reason of the || Aitchigon, Vol. X, p. 118. agreement|| entered into with him in , 1861, whereby the Kesident undertook to take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury proved to have been inflicted by sea upon Bahrein or upon its dependencies in the Gulf” In a considerable proportion of the recent cases, the victims have been subjects of Bahrein, and in two such cases no reparation has been obtained of any kind either by way of recovery of the property or by punishment of the offenders’ while in other cases, though penalties have been inflicted, no restitution has been made to the sufferers. The Chief cannot be admitted to have any legiti mate grievance on this score, but our relations with him make it incumbent upon us to take all reasonable measures for his protection. 5..

Before arriving at a final decision in the matter, tbe Officer Com manding His Majesty’s Naval Forces, East Indian Station, was consulted. Sir Charles Drury was opposed to tbe suggested maintenance of an armed dhow by the naval authorities; but suggested that the Sheikh of Bahrein mig t provide and maintain a vessel without, however, having any control whatever over her movements at sea. It seems doubtful whether the Chief could even he asked to agree to such an arrangement. 7. It may be hoped that the arrangement whereby in future three gun boats of the Royal Navy will he stationed permanently in the Gulf may lead to some improvement in the security of these parts, hut even under the revised scheme it will not always be practicable to make a British ship of war available to cruise in Bahrein waters, and, even if this were possible, the dangers attending the navigation of these seas by vessels of considerable draught, together with the publicity which attends the movements of a ship of war, present considerable difficulties. It is for consideration, therefore, whether it might not he advisable, as a tentative measure, to approve the Sheikh’s original proposal, subject to the restrictions proposed by Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball. The sanction would, in the first instance, be provisional, and its continuance would depend on the success or failure of the experiment. C. L. S. Russell, —9-11-03. S. M. Frasee,— 11-11-03.

It was explained, however, that the Governor-General in Council was desirous that British Naval officers should avoid giving Turkish officials any opportunity of asserting by overt action such nominal authority as the Porte possesses in the locality, and con sidered that, to this end, His Majesty’s ships should refrain from visitin°- the harbour of El Bidda, except when special occasion arose for so doing. °The instructions were approved by Her late Majesty’s Government.

In April 1902, J Colonel Kemball reported that Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani of Katr had approached him with a request to be taken under British protection. The matter was referred to the Secretary of State, with the remark that the Government of India saw no objection to the Besident being permitted to institute enquiries as to the Pro. No. 526 in Secret e., July 1902 , Nos. 519 - actual position of Ahmed-bin-Thani, and 626, that, should it prove that the Sheikh was established as Chief of El Katr, they would propose to authorise Colonel Kemball to conclude with him an agreement similar to those executed with the Trucial Chiefs of the Arab Coast. It was added that this arrangement would involve an assurance to the Chief of protection against Turkey and Pro.

Later information received from the Political Besident was reported to the Secretary of State on the 19th January 1903, to the effect that Jasim-bin-Thani was the recog nised Chief of Katr, and that the Turks styled him Kaimmakam, though he repudiated the title; that his brother, Ahmed-bin-Thani, was the de facto Chief, and was regarded as heir to his brother, who was over 80 vears of age.

Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople immediately made representations to the Grand Yizier on the subject, and was assured by His Highness that the Turkish Government had no knowledge of the appointment, and that Yusuf Bey would be recalled. In August the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that Yusuf Bey had been dismissed from his post at Wakra, but had been replaced by Abdul Rahman, son of Jasim-bin-Thani, Sheikh of Katr. The information was communicated to the Secretary of State, who agreed that, as El Katr is beyond the sphere in which nominal suzerainty of the Porte is recognised by His Majesty’s Government, we should object to the appointment by Turkey of any administrative official. The Political Resident was informed accordingly, and on the 21st September the Consul at Basrah reported that the Wali had instructed the Mutassarif of A1 Hassa to suppress the Mudirate at Wakra, and to revert to the status quo ante. On the 20th September Mr. Gaskin who had been deputed to visit Katr reported that he had interviewed both Jasim and Ahmed. The former stated that his son had been made Sheikh of Wakra five years ago by Sheikh Ahmed; and though he had heard of the recent action of the Mutassarif of Al Hassa, he had paid no attention to it, and had left Ahmed to deal with the matter. Mr. Gaskin inferred that he disapproved of the Turks appointing his son Mudir of Wakra. Sheikh Ahmed observed that the Mutassarif was apparently anxious to extend Turkish authority in Katr; and, if he succeeded in his designs, the whole peninsula would be absorbed by the Porte, and his family would be driven out of the country, as they could not oppose the Turks for any length of time, should they really make up their minds to take over the country and employ force; for this reason, he was very eager to know whether His Majesty’s Govern ment would extend their protection over Katr in the event of a petition being submitted to them to that effect. The Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, informed him that the discussion of this subject was beyond his province, and consequently could give him no reply. C. L. S. Russell, —3-11-03.KOWEIT AFFAIRS.

The question was further considered in connection with recent proposals for the reorganisation of the Consular Service in Persia and the Gulf. In his telegram of the 1st Jane, the Viceroy suggested that, if an Indian officer were appointed to the Consulate at Mohammerah, a gun-boat might be placed at his disposal, to enable him to visit Koweit from time to time. The Secretary of State replied that this proposal was not likely to be received favourably, and from the letter of the 18th June from the India Office to the Foreign Office, it will be seen that at the same time His Lordship suggested that a gun-boat might be placed at the disposal of the Consul at Basrah to allow of his visiting Koweit.

In his reply, dated the 26th§ July 1903, Colonel Kemball stated that, in his No g opinion, the appointment of an English officer to Koweit was likely to impose inconvenient responsibility on the British Government, but that we should, however, have a more competent representative at Koweit, and suggested that the Vice-Consul at Mohammerah might be given political charge of Koweit. The Resident’s message was repeated [| to the Secretary of State with an explanation of the reasons which led the Government of India to consider that the advantages of the appointment of a British officer at Koweit would outweigh the dis advantages. In reply the Secretary of State said^ that on the whole the existing system No 10 under which the Resident in the Persian Gulf, or one of his officers, is the ordinary channel of communication was considered to work well, but that should it hereafter be found necessary to establish closer touch with Koweit, it should be effected gradually by means of temporary visits by a selected officer repeated at intervals until residence becomes practically permanent there. 4. The Director-General, Indian Medical Service, was asked, on the 3rd Sep tember 1903, whether he could recommend a Muhammadan Assistant Surgeon who would be suitable for deputation to Koweit, to hold charge of a Post Office, to perform such sanitary and medical duties as might be required of him, and to be the local representative of the Indian Government under the orders of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

A survey of the Khor would undoubtedly be of much value, but it is a question whether it could at present be undertaken without attracting attention and raising inconvenient questions with the Turks and indirectly also with Germany. The question will no doubt be considered locallv during His Excellency’s tour. A further reference to His Majesty’s Gov ernment would seem necessary before action could be taken. C. L. S.

J . 4- Our evidence of the present extent of the evil is not clear. If special action he considered necessary, it seems primd facie preferable to rely on such constant pressure on the Turkish and Persian authorities as, combined with the vigilance of a British ship of war, appears to have secured immunity from piracy throughout the year 1899. With three gun-boats stationed permanently in the Gulf, it ought in future to be possible to take more systematic action than has hitherto been practicable in this matter. 5. In a demi-official letter, dated the 30th September 1903, Major Burton wrote that a certain launch now in the possession of Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co., though rarely used by them, was in the opinion of the Commander of the “ Lapwing ” exactly what was required for pirate hunting. The suggestion has been made that the launch might be acquired by the Government. The point has been noted for consideration during His Excellency’s tour. C. L. S. Russell,— 6-11-03. S. M.

It Jt Secret e., November 1896, Nos. 214 - 223 . wus suggested to the Foreign Office by Sir Mortimer Durand in a letter from §§ Secret e., June 1903 , Nos. 255 - 257 . lehran, dated the Hth August 1896. In their despatch§§ to the Secretary of State on the subject of Consular guards m Persia, No. 53, dated the 7th May 1903 the Government of India invited attention to this proposal, and enquired whether His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to consider any such scheme favourably. On the 18th September, in replying on the general question of Consular guards, Lord George Hamilton contented himself with a reference to Sir Arthur Hardinge’s opinion, in which Lord Lansdowne concurred, that the time was not then ripe for the establishment of an Arab Bakhtiari force. 4. On t he 9th October 1903, the Secretary of State telegraphed that, in conse quence of the death (on the 31st July 1903) of Isfendiar Khan, the Bakhtiari Chief, and the apprehension of interference of Russia in the Bakhtiari country, Lord Lansdowne suggested provisionally, pending further proposals from Sir A. Hardinge, who was sending his Military Attache to the spot to report, that the Bakhtiaris and Lurs should be encouraged to raise their own Military Police for the protection of the roads in the Karun region, which had been deyeloped by British enterprise and capital. The Secretary of State addedI that the grant of a small subsidy to the Chiefs would he necessary, in return for which their Police would be inspected occasionally by the Vice-Consuls at Ahwaz and Kermanshah and the Military Attache to the Legation; and observed that, under existing arrangements, the subsidy would be shared between the English and Indian Exchequers. The views of the Viceroy were invited on this proposal. 5. A few days later we received a report, dated the 1st September 1903, from Manor Burton who, with the approval of His Majesty’s _ Government, had been directed to visit the Bakhtiari country and place himself m touch with their Chiefs He said that he had seen the Sipahdar and Haji Kuli Khan, and that they were quite ready, with the consent of the Persian Government, to accept the scheme for training mounted or unmounted levies, preferably the former. Major Burton put the cost of mounted men at 200 tomans per annum in Tehran or Tabriz, 50 tomans between Dizful and Isfahan, and 30 tomans if employed in their own country; and suggested that the necessity foi guarding the Bakhtiari road and the extension to Kum and Khoremabad would give an opportunity for approaching the Persian Government. On the 22nd October, His Excellency the Viceroy telegraphed the above information to the Secretary of State, and added that, subject to discussion of the question with Sir A. Hardinge, Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball, and Major Burton, he was of opinion that the scheme for road guards was promising and should be pursued without delay, more especially in view of the recent recruitment of 100 Bakhtiaris for the Cossack Brigade in Tehran. It was further stated that the Government of India would be prepared to share the subsidy with the Imperial Government, but that His Excellency would like to discuss the method of payment with Sir A. Hardinge. C. L. S. Russell, —9-11-03. S. M. Eraser,— 10-11-03. Foreign Office Frees—No, 1470-10-11.03—30,Foreign Office Press—No. 1420—4-11-03—80# QUARANTINE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE PERSIAN GULP.

No. 151 in Secret e., FeWry 1901 , Persian Gulf, the pearl banks having Nos. 151 - 152 . always been considered* the exclusive property of the coast Arabs. Attempts made, both by foreigners and British subjects, to prospect for pearls have so far come to nothing. The Sheikh of t Pro. No. 337 in Political a., January 1874 , Bahrein has in the past been approached Nos. 333 - 341 . on su bject, but has declined f to entertain relations with parties unauthorised by the British Government. The latest phase of the case is that, early in 1903, two Frenchmen, named Dumas and Castelin, arrived at Bahrein with the intention, it was suspected, of prospecting the pearl hanks round that island. The Chief, however, refused to entertain any proposals on the subject. Subsequently, Mons. Dumas’s Assistant proceeded to Marseilles, and it was supposed that he had gone to engage a diver. The last report received was to the effect that Mons. Dumas had left Bahrein for Baghdad on account of the plague, but it was presumed that he would return later on. The Legislative Department, who were consulted as to our legal position in endeavouring to maintain the monopoly of the fisheries in the hands of the Arab tribes, expressed the opinion that the Arabs have no right beyond territorial waters, which an international tribunal would recognise; that the basis of “ prescriptive ” right is the acquiescence of possible rivals, but that it does not appear that foreign Governments have acquiesced in the doctrine that these fisheries belong exclusively to the Arabs. The case was noted, however, of the Ceylon fisheries, where exclusive rights had been asserted to exist beyond the limit of territorial waters. For a more complete statement of the case, reference is invited to the current notes on the subject. C. L. S. Russell,— 6-11-03. S. M.

It was added, however, that the Governor-General in Council was desirous . that British Naval officers should avoid giving Turkish official any opportunity of asserting by overt action such nominal authority as the Porte possesses m the locality, and considered that, to this end, British ships of war should refrain from visiting the harbour of El Bidaa, except when special occasion for doing so arose.

In our despatch of the 2nd October 1902, we suggested two alternative Secret e., October 1902 , Nos. ?7-78. proposals to His Majesty’s Government, -•l-.-ij i viz. (1) that a special Consular Service should be constituted to provide officers for certain posts in Persia and the Persian Gulf, and (2) that a special Persian section should he organised in the Levant Consular Service with a view to manning the posts in question. Neither of these proposals found acceptance with His Majesty’s Govern ment, but the opportunity was taken to consider the question of creating certain new Consular appointments, and to effect minor adjustments in the present manner of filling certain posts. After some correspondence His Majesty’s Government directed that the scale of appointments, and the source from which they should be manned should be as follows;— * Indian Appointments. Bushire Meshed Baghdad Consulates-General Seistan Kerman Mohammerah Consulates Levant Service. { Ispahan. Tabriz, f Basrah, f Shiraz. Bunder Abbas' Bahrein Kermanshah Vice-Consulates I Resht. J Tehran. j Bushire. V. Ahwaz. The net result is (1) the addition to the Levant Service of one Consulate, viz., Shiraz, newly created, and two Vice-Consulates, viz., Eushire and Ahwaz* the latter a new appointment, the former one hitherto manned from India; (2) the addition to Indian posts of one Consulate, viz., Mohammerah, formerly a Vice-Consulate officered from the Levant Service, and one Vice-Consulate, viz., Kermanshah, a post newly created. The intention is, however, that for the present Mr. McDouall, the Vice-Consul at Mohammerah, should not be disturbed, and that, for so long as he stays at Mohammerah, Ahwaz should he officered from India. Of the present Indian incumbent of the Bushire Vice- Consulate, no mention has been made : it is presumed that he will not be moved for the present. It may be noted that the inclusion of Shiraz among the posts to be filled from the Levant Service has formed the subject of protest from the Government of India. The reason for the decision of His Majesty’s Govern ment on this point is unknown. The action at present required, then, of the Government of India under the sanctioned scheme is to establish Vice-Consulates at Kermanshah and at Ahwaz—the incumbent of the latter post to be specially charged with the duty of cultivating friendly relations with the Lur and Bakhtiari tribes. Colonel Kemball, however, in a demi-official letter dated the 15th October, has expressed the opinion— (1) that the commercial interests at Ahwaz are such that the post there should be held by an officer versed in trade matters; (2) that if the Ahwaz appointment is thus filled, the need for a Consular officer of any kind at Mohammerah is doubtful; (3) that an officer dealing with the tribes would find full employ ment in this work alone ; and could not satisfactorily combine it with his commercial duties as a Consul; (4) that in many ways Isfahan, and not Ahwaz, would be the most suitable head-quarters for an officer moving among the tribes. His Excellency has noted that he will discuss the case with Sir Arthur Hardinge in the Gulf. C. L. S. Russell, —6-11-03. S. M. Eraser, —10-11-03.Foreign Office Press—No. 1472 —10-11-03—30.

Lord Kimberley, however, declined to accept our view of the matter, and the armament which had been put on board the “ Lawrence ” was withdrawn. Again, in 1893, the importance of the Resident’s despatch boat being armed was emphasised by certain circumstances connected with threat ened disturbances about Bunder Abbas. It happened that complications with a neighbouring Chief were feared at a moment when no vessel of the Royal Navy was present in the Gulf. The difficulty passed over, however, without any resort to force being necessary, and the question was not re-opened.

In some instances (columns 7, 8, and 15) the totals correspond exactly. On the assumption, therefore, that the figures in the Persian Gulf Administration Reports are correct and, in the absence of any other data, a third table is submitted showing the trade of the Persian Gulf for the years 1898, 1899, 1900, and 1901. A table for the year 1902 cannot be prepared, as the Administration Report for that year has been submitted in a different form to that of those previously rendered, and it does not give the required information. No figures of the Basrah trade can be traced, but these are, perhaps, unnecessary. G. L. T.,—10-11-03. I have checked these figures and submit a clean proof containing certain corrections. I have not, however, been able to check all and propose to have them further scrutinised in office. These papers may go to Camp at once. C. L. S. Russell,— 11-11-03. S. M.

No troops would, there fore, be available for operations in Persia. The attitude of Afghanistan was uncertain. Persia was not in a position to offer any resistance to the use of her territory in the north as a route for a Russian advance. The distance to be traversed and the difficult nature of the intervening country rendered it unlikely that any effective attack could be organized against the flank of the Russian advance by means of the tribes round Mohammerah and in other parts of Southern Persia. As regards naval considerations, Prince Louis of Battenberg stated that no naval base or station was required in the Gulf, and that a Russian naval station there would not be formidable unless fortified, and, above all, with its communications by land fully established. He also stated that the Admiralty view was fully set forth in the Memorandum dated November 12, 1902. In these circumstances, it was held that, in the event of war, our action in the direction of Persia should be limited to (1) the occupation of Seistan, or to holding a force ready for the purpose within striking distance ; (2) the seizure and occupation by Indian troops of Bandar Abbas, with the adjoining Islands of Kishm, Hanjam, and Ormuz ; (3) the exclusion of any foreign Power from the Isthmus of Maklab to Mosandim Point and along the El Batineh coast between Khor Khalba and DibbcV, as far as circumstances would admit ; and (4) the protection of British subjects and trades at Bushire, so long as no serious opera tions on land were required at that port. The visits of British ships to other islands and ports in the Gulf would otherwise suffice to maintain our influence there as far as circumstances would allow. 2. The second question propounded was: “What action would it be expedient that Great Britain should take in the event of disorders occurrina: in Pei'sia, and occasioning a Russian occupation in the north—or in anticipation of such disorder—it being understood that occupation by Great Britain of Persian territory would not be directed against Russia, but would be undertaken in the interests of peace and order, and a,s an assertion of the posi-11 3 tion of Great Britain as jointly interested with Bussia in the maintenance of the Persian kingdom.” The extent of action open to us was held to be limited by the following conditions :— (i.) We have no troops available for the effective occupation of Persian territory, or even of any large number of Persian ports; and it is by troops and not by ships that positions on the sea-coast must be held. (ii.) We should run the risk of creating a most unfavourable impression upon India if we occupied any ports or districts from which we might pro bably be forced to retire, either in view of an im pending collision with Russia, or subsequently to an outbreak of hostilities. (iii.) Whatever steps we might take should be such as to involve as little as possible the risk of further complications by the intervention of other foreign Powers in any temporary measures taken to preserve order in Persia. The conclusion arrived at was that, in the contingency above mentioned, of a Russian occu pation in the north, we should at once occupy Bandar Abbas, and the three islands of Ormuz, Kishm, and Hanjam ; that we should protect and watch British interests at Bushire ; that we should occupy, or be prepared to occupy, Seistan, with an adequate force of troops from India, and that our ships of war should pay visits to other ports and islands in the Gulf. But it was held that no other occupation of territory or operations inland should be attempted. 3. The third question was: “In what parti- cnlar portions of Persia and by what methods can the extension of British influence be most successfully prosecuted and to the best advantage for general purposes, and for the contingencies mentioned in questions (l! and (2).” The answer to this question was determined by what had been settled on the preceding questions. We should, it was thought, steadily prepare for an occupation of Seistan by extending the railway beyond Nushki, and pushing our trade. We should reassert our claims at Bassidore and in the Mosandim promontory, especially in theElphinstone Inlet, and revert to the jurisdiction of the Chief of Shargah over the coast from Dibba to Khor Kalba. All possible care should be taken to prevent any other Power from gaining a footing at BandarAbbas or on any one of tlie neighbouring islands. For the rest, we should continue to encourage trade on the Karun, to maintain our position at Bushire, and to support Persia as long as possible by peaceful means. The extension of telegraphs under British management was also indicated as a desirable measure. As regards railways, Sir W. Nicholson stated that a railway from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Ispahan would be to our advantage if we had troops available to guard it in time of war. But as we had not, the opening up of these routes would merely provide the Russians with increased facilities for getting to the Southern Coast. Prince Louis of Battenberg explained that the establishment of a Russian coal depot at Charbar might be a convenience for their cruisers and transports going to the Far East in time of peace, but had no serious significance in case of war, so long as it was not fortified and provided with communications by land with a Russian base. It was agreed that in reality the most effective check to Russian progress towards South Persia lay in the completion of the railway from Con stantinople to Bagdad, as it would bring the Turks in force on the flank of a Russian advance, and that it would be a great mistake to oppose the project, which we ought on the contrary to encourage to the best of our power, provided we can acquire our proper share in the control of the railway and of its outlet on the Persian Gulf. It was understood that the discussion was to be limited to the subjects of the terms of reference ; and the larger questions, (1) whether there was any action on the part of Russia in respect of Persia which might be held to constitute a casus belli, and (2) whether any agreement with Russia as to Persia was desirable or possible, were not raised.

ALTHAM, A.Q.M.G,Received on the 25th July 1903, under cover of a letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, at Tehran, No. 23, dated the 27th June 1903. No. 88 (Secret), dated C ula 1 iek, the 17th June 1903. From— Sik A.. H. Haedinge, K.C.M.GL, C.B., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, To—The Marquess o£ Lansdowne, K.G. I had the honour to receive some months ago the papers enclosed in Your Lordship’s despatch No, 3 Secret of Jan- Mihtary Attache No. 2 . uary 13th, 1903, respecting the nature and the limits of the action to be taken by His Majesty’s Government should Rus sia send troops into Persia. The conclusion to which these papers arrived seemed to be that our reply to a Prussian invasion of northern Persia, whether undertaken as a, result of war with England, or with the object of repressing internal disturbances, must, un fortunately, in view of present conditions, be limited to the occupation of Seistan and Bunder Abbas, and to preventing the seizure of any other southern ports. From a political point of view such a conclusion appeared to me almost tantamount to an abdication of our position in this country, but I did not feel qualified to put forward any counter suggestions without first discussing their practicability with a military expert. My own ideas had always been that a British force, not necessarily large, with Mokammerah or Ahwaz as its base, might, in concert with the Arab tribes under the Sheikh of Mohammerah and with the Bakhtiari Chiefs, secure the south-western corner of Persia and perhaps even hold Isfahan. X discussed this idea with Major Douglas on his arrival here, and he has now drawn up a memorandum on the subject, which he sends in the enclosed despatch. The question is one of somewhat more practical interest than it was when I first talked it over last summer with Your Lordship, for there are indications that the growing discontent throughout Persia is being brought to a head by a variety of causes, one of the chief of them being the new tariff. The clerical agitation, which I warned Your Lordship might ere long break out, is showing symptoms of being more serious than seemed likely to be the case a year a'go, and is rendered increasingly formidable by the palpable weakness of the Government and by the fact that it is apparently blending with, or at least being used as a cloak by, the anti-dynastic and pan Jslamic forces originally set im mot ion by the late Seyed Jemaleddin. Even if it subsides, as I am personally inclined to think it will for the present, a new loan or a new Boyal journey to Europe may re-inflame it v and should it result in widespread disturbances which the Persian Government is powerless to quell, we may find ourselves at any moment face to face with the armed intervention of Russia. The Russian Minister has indeed already inti mated to the Grand Vizier, though this is perhaps just now a piece of bluff and not a serious threat, that if the helplessness of the Persian Government should occasion more serious troubles at Tabriz and mother parts of Azerbaijan, Russian troops may be obliged to cross the frontier. It is this latter contingency which I regard as most worthy of consideration from the point of view of British interests in Persia. Supposing that we were involved in war with Russia on some question unconnected with Persian affairs, say China or Afghanistan or the near East, the main arena of the conflict would, I imagine, lie outside this country, although both belligerents would, no doubt, make use of Persian soil, if necessary, to carry on their respective operations without much regard for the rights or interests of the Shah. The Russians would treat Kborassan as if it were their own, we and they might both deal in the same way with Seistan or with any Gulf port which we happened to be able, if only for a time, to occupy, and the protests of Persia, 11if she ventured to make any, would be answered much as were those of Denmark when we seized the Danish fleet to prevent its being captured by Napoleon. In such a case the detachment of any troops from the defence of India for operations in the interior of southern Persia would be of no advantage, even if it were feasible, and Persia, except where parts of her territory were more or less temporarily occupied for its own convenience by one or other of the hostile armies, would doubtless lapse into a condition of anarchy similar to that which prevailed between the death of Nadir Shah and the accession of the Kajar Dynasty, until her future status and Government were settled with out reference to herself by England and Russia at the peace. The position would, however, be very different if the entry of Russian troops into Persia were occasioned by a question arising within Persia itself, for it may, I think, be taken for granted that if we did not, in the event of a Russian invasion of northern Persia, do more than hold Bunder Abbas and Seistan, Russia would take possession of all the rest of the country, at any rate of the great cities and of the routes connecting them, and would not evacuate it until she had reduced it, like Manchuria, to the condition of a Russian Egypt. She might, as the price of our acquiescence in this state of things, leave us Seistan and Bunder Abbas, and I do not see why she should not do so, if she had all the rest of the sea-board and of Khorassan, for once she had made her military railways through Persia to the coast and to our Indian frontier and had connected them with the existing system she would have acquired the means of taking these places from us later on without very great difficulty, unless of course we became, not merely as we should do in a geographical sense, but in respect of our military system, a regular con tinental power. She might not indeed need to occupy the whole or even the greater part of Persia. If she marched into Tabriz, Tehran and Meshed, put down the revolu tionary movement by stern measures in those cities and reorganised the Per sian army as Sir Evelyn Wood did that of Egypt, she might well afford to- evacuate the country on condition that we withdrew simultaneously from Seistan and Bunder Abbas. Persia would, however, from that moment be to all intents and purposes a Russian Egypt, even if no regular Russian garrison remained within its borders, and English influence would be as completely dead and buried, not merely at Tehran but throughout the length and breadth of the land, as Erench influence has been in the Nile Valley since the day when Colonel Marchand hauled the tricolor down at Eashoda. It may, in fact, be doubted whether we should not he more discredited in the eyes of the Persians and Afghans, and throughout the Mahomedan world, if we* abandoned Persia, all except a few outlying points, to he dealt with by a Russian army as it pleased, without making an affort to assert our rights and interests in a coun try in which we have hitherto claimed a position of at least equality, than if we were to strike in defence of them a momentarily unsuccessful blow. In any case the effacement of British influence in Persia, whether brought about by our acquiescence in a temporary or permanent occupation by RusGa of the greater part of the country, including the present and ancient capitals would he so damaging to our prestige throughout Asia that it is worth while considering, before we finally decide to endure it, whether we could not, besides holding Seistan and Bunder Abbas, occupy, in alliance with the Arabs, Bakhtia- ris and other south Persian tribes, the corner of South-West Persia, described in Major Douglas’ memorandum, and even put a few thousand men into Isfahan our occupation of which, as the old historical metropolis of Persia would balance a Russian occupation of Tehran and deprive the Russians of any excuse for advancing further south on the pretext of preserving the Shah’s authority m the southern portion of his kingdom. It would probably not be necessary for us to take any military measures in-the interior of Ears or of Kerman for the presence of a Russian force at Tehran and of a British force supported by the Bakhtians at Isfahan, or within striking distance of it, would, in all likeli hood, put an end to a revolutionary movement whose leaders would have to 1213 reckon, not merely with the Shah and his worthless and undisciplined armv hut with two great European Powers. p “euarmy, out her qUeSt 4° n ? en fif 8 ’ .

The distances of both places from her bases, which would be Meshed and Tabnz respectively, and from our own, which would be Quetta in the east and Mohammerah or Bus hire m the west, would be practically about the same and m some ways I should think she would find it as hard to conquer the mountain- ousBakhtian region m face of the opposition of its inhabitants as to evict the British garrison from Seistan. Fi ; om , the language which the Bakhtiari chiefs have held to me I entertain iiGle doubt that we could rely on their acting with us and accepting our political direction m the event of a Russian occupation of northern Persia as the result of revolutionary disturbances. But it will, I think, be necessary if we wish them to do this to continue to cultivate pretty close and intimate relations with them as well as with the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whose friendship would be a factor of great importance. i I have proposed to Major Douglas that he should take an early oppor tunity of visiting the Zil-es-Sultan at Isfahan and making the acquaintance, in their own country, of the Bakhtiari Khans. He will then, after studying the question on the spot, be in a position to give us more authentic information than we at present possess as to the feasibility of the plan suo-onsted in his memorandum. 00 It is obviously premature at this stage of affairs to discuss with minute ness, in a despatch such as this, contingencies which may never arise or which if they should arise, may be so affected by other circumstances as to deprive ’of all practical utility any present suggestions as to how they should be met My only object in offering the above observations is to indicate my reasons for strongly urging, on political grounds, a consideration of the views submitted on strategic and military ones, by Major Douglas.K3 The recommendations of the conference and the considerations on which they were based, may he summarised very briefly as follows:— The desirability of not allowing Eussia to occupy the south of Persia is recognized by all, at the same time ; (1) The Admiralty consider that “ a Eussian occupation of Persia, re garded fiom the point of view of the Admiralty only, would be a sure cause of increased naval expenditure but not per se a suffi cient CASUS BELLI.” (2) The War Oefice point out that we have no available troops with which to hold the country, and that it is better not to occupy it at all than to risk the loss of prestige that would follow on a forced withdrawal later. They hold'that, if Persia is broken up, we must at least secure Seistan and keep Russia out of the Persian Gulf, but that it would be dangerous under present circumstances to risk a war with Prance and Eussia. (3) The Conference, after considering these points, and others of a purely political nature, recommended that in case of (a) war with Eussia, (l) the occupation by Eussia of the North of Persia, our action should be confined to : (1) The occupation of Seistan or preparations to occupy it if necessary. ( r ) seizure.and occupation of Eunder Abbas and adjacent islands. (3) The protection of British influence at Bushire and other ports in the Gulf. It is impossible not to recognize the force of the facts and arguments brought forward by the War Office, however unpleasant such recognition may be. °To quote from Lieutenant-Colonel Altham’s memorandum, “ there is in fact no sound solution of the Persian question if we adhere to our present lines of military organization and to our present policy of isolation from all European lo keep Eussia out of the Persian Gulf it is not sufficient to occupy Seistan and Bunder Abbas only, for to allow Eussia to absorb the hinterland of Bunder Abbas would, as pointed out in the last paragraph of the Admiralty memoran dum, be eventually to render that port itself untenable and our object in occu pying it would obviously not be fulfilled if we allowed Eussia to seize Charbar or some other port to the east of Bunder Abbas. To attain our object we must be piepared if necessary to defend the wTiole triangle of country included between the line Seistan-Bunder Abbas, our present frontier in Baluchistan and the sea. There are two ways in which this might be done. We mi 'lit select for defence some line between the Kashan-Yezd-Karman-Bam road and the sea, which w r ith the occupation of Seistan and taking into account the limita tions on the movement of troops which the geographical features of the country impose, would be sufficient to attain our object. Such a line, wherever we take it, could not w r ell be less than 200 miles long and it would be an extremely difficult position to. hold against Eussia fairly established in the south-west of Persia, and advancing along the numerous roads wdiich lead south-eastwards from the line Kashan-Isfahan-Shiraz-Bushire. Moreover it includes no races who, if enlisted in our service, could be of any assistance to us in expellin 0 ’ an invader. 1 ° The other alternative is to occupy a line with its right covering Isfahan and its left on the Turkish frontier. This would vary in length according to its. position, from about 250 miles along the line Isfahan-Dizful, to nearly 400 miles in the direction Isfahan-Khanikin. The country through which it runs is difficult and mountainous, and admirably suited for defence : the roads which traverse it from north to south are mere hill tracks and it is peopled by well armed and warlike tribes who, if organized and led by British officers, would according to all accounts form a very valuable addition to our fightin' strength Between Isfahan and Seistan there is only one road by which large °bodies of troops could be moved from the north of Persia towards the sea, namely that which runs from Kashan, Yezd and Kerman, and Isfahan occupies such a position on the flank of this road, that it would be impossible for a force from the north to use it without first detaching a sufficient number of troops to effectuallv mask Isfahan. J 14To hold this line and Seistan is to deny to an adversary in the north the whole of southern Persia. To allow Russia to occupy the south-west of Persia ia to place ourselves at such a disadvantage that it would appear to be better for us to give up all idea of holding Bunder Abbas or any other point on the mainland of Persia, and to content ourselves with Seistan and our present frontier to the south of it : while by occupying and fortifying Has Musandim and possibly some of the islands in the Gulf, we might do our best to neutralise the value of the latter to Russia. It is also to definitely isolate India from all hope of future land communication with Europe or any of our foreign possessions except through Russian territory. If then we are to keep Russia out of the Persian Gulf, it is of the greatest importance that we should prevent her from obtaining a foothold in south, western Persia : and in the absence either of troops which could, in case of war, be spared to hold it, or of an ally who would be prepared to defend this part of the country against Russian aggression, the only other course open to us is to endeavour, if possible, to organize such assistance among the people of the country, as would render the task of occupying Isfahan and the territory to the south of it as difficult for our enemies as possible. The only tribes in southern Persia which appear capable of offering any resistance to a civilised power are the Lurs, Bakhtiaris, Kashkais and Arab tribes of Arahistan. All of these, and especially the first three, are described as hardy, courageous and warlike races, possessing a large number of modern weapons, and trained in their use. Of these, the Bakhtiaris, who occupy the country immediately to the west of Isfahan, are perhaps the most important. The numbers which they could put into the field have been variously estimated, but according to Mr. Preece, who probably knows more about them than any other European in Persia, their chief could gather a following of 20,000 men in a month. Our own experience among the Afridis and other tribes of the north west frontier of India has shown us how formidable an opponent any deter mined body of men, armed with good weapons and skilled in their use* can be ; especially in a mountainous country with which they are thoroughly familiar. It is not contended that these tribesmen could stand up to Russian troops in the open, nor would it be wise for them to do so, even if they could be induced to attempt it. Their role would be rather to carry on a guerilla warfare, to utilise their position to harass the Hanks of any force advancing towards Isfahan from the north, and in case of occupation of the latter town by the enemy, by repeated and persistent attacks on his line of communications to render his tenure as unsafe as possible. At the same time they would be prepared to resist to the utmost any attempt to enter their country either for the purpose of reducing them to subjection or of reaching the Karan from this direction. Similarly in case of occupation by Russia of Kermanshah and Hamadan, the Lur tribes which inhabit the bills between the Bakhtiaris and the Turkish frontier could by repeated raids into the country round these towns, compel the Russians to keep there a much larger body of troops than they would otherwise require, and could offer a formidable resistance to any attempt to reach the lower Karun from the north. The Kashkais and Arab tribes further to the south might also be utilised to oppose any advance towards the country they inhabit. All these would of course require assistance from us, in the way of officers to organise and lead them, money, arms, and ammunition ; and above all it will be necessary to gain their confidence beforehand so as to induce them to act with us. _ It will doubtless be argued that it is absurd to expect a horde of undis ciplined tribesmen to offer any serious resistance to a great power, and there is no doubt that Russia could in time bring against them sufficient force to crush their opposition and reduce them to complete subjection. Whether in case of war with England she would be prepared to do so is at least doubtful. W hether acting alone or in conjunction with Erance, all land operations in Asia would be conducted by Russia only. Under present circumstances her main efforts would in all probability be directed against India, which is the 15only portion of onr Empire where she could hope to deal us such a serious blow as would bring us to terras and finish the war. Operating from her pre sent bases, a campaign against India would he a very difficult matter. It is true that with the railways now in existence and still more after the Tashkend- Orenhurg line is completed, she could place a large number of troops and supplies at any points on her railway systems, hut her difficulties then only commence. Before she can even make a start, she must collect and organize very large bodies of transport, for the provision of which so far as we know no adequate organization exists in peace time, and with each step into Afghan istan these difficulties are enormously increased. If in addition to opera tions through Afghan territory, a column were sent from Trans-Caspia towards Seistan, and this would most probably he done if only to keep our troops there engaged and prevent their acting against the flank of the line Herat-Kandahar, it would still further add to her transport difficulties, for this column would be mainly dependent on Khorassan for its transport and any large force advancing from Kushk on Herat would also require to draw largely on the neighbourhood of Mehsed for the carriage it would require. If we were acting with Japan as our ally, considerable pressure would also ho exerted against Bussia in the Ear East, and this with the operations against India would he a very severe drain on her resources. Under these circum stances, she would he hardly prepared to undertake a separate expedition against the armed tribesmen of South-West Persia, if these were prepared to offer a determined resistance, though doubtless, if unopposed, she would occupy the country at least as far south as Isfahan. The present state, of our knowledge regarding the tribes mentioned above, is not sufficient to justify the expres sion of any very decided opinion as to the amount of resistance they would, with active British support, he able and willing to offer to Bussia. The dif ferent estimates of their numbers, fighting qualities and disposition are greatly at variance, but so far as they go, they are at least sufficient to justify the opinion that a scheme, such as that indicated, for utilising them to oppose a Bussian advance is worthy of serious examination. The first thing we require is accurate information, and with this object as well as that of spreading our influence among them generally, selected officers might be attached to our Consulates at Isfahan and Bushire, and possibly also at Kermanshah, whose main duty would he to travel about among them. It would also go far to increase our influence with them, and would assist greatly in forming an accurate judgment of their military capacities, if small bodies could now be enlisted in our service. The guard of Indian sawars at Isfahan miriit he replaced by an equal number of selected Bakhtiari tribesmen, pre ferably men belonging to or connected with influential families. A small force on the lines of the local frontier levies in India might he enlisted as guards for the Shuster-Isfahan road (both the above could be under an officer at Isfahan), and in the event of a road being made through the Lur country, a similar force migut be raised among that tribe. If some steps such as these were taken, and if a closer knowledge of these tribes justified the hopes that they could be induced to offer active opposition to Bussian occupation of Isfahan and the country to the south of it, we ^could in case of war with Bussia, by supplying them with arms, ammunition and money, and bv sending officers to organise their resistance, at least do something to prevent this important part of Persia from falling into the hands of our enemies. In the other case of an occupation by Bussia of the north of Persia and the collapse of the Government of the latter country, it would only be necessary to send to Isfahan a force sufficient to emphasise the fact that we consider this part of Persia within our sphere and are not prepared to give it up. It has been urged that this latter course might he made by Bussia a. cams belli. What Prussia wants is possession of the southern coast of Persia and free access to the sea, and this can only be secured to her by the occupation of Bunder Abbas or some port further to the east. Unless we are going to. give her this, we must make up our minds to fight for it, if necessaiy, and if we could count on the assistance of the Bakhtiaris and other tribes, it would be easier for us to defend Bunder Abbas from Seistan and the line Isfahan to the Turkish frontier than from any other line further to the east.

Increase in Persia, /7, (l^) ReglfCmentI V THE PRESENT STATE OF THE PERSO-BALUCH BORDER. You asked me to prepare a note on the above subject. The notes recorded last month by Excellency the Viceroy and yourself give a complete summary of the situation in Makran up to the time of Major Showers' second visit to Kej and the Persian border in 1902. I understand that you want a note on what has transpired on the border since. We have not much information on the subject. The Baluchistan Administration Report for the year 1902-03 contains the following passage:— “ Makran has been undisturbed during the year for the first time for a long time past, and the Nazim has had time to devote the whole of his attention to the adminis tration which has been attended with very satisfactory results . We have nothing to controvert this statement as regards our side of the border: but affairs on the Persian side are far from satisfactory. I _ would first refer very briefly to the case of Muhammad Umar Khan, Nausherwani. In Major Showers' settlement with the Governor-General of Kerman a large balance was struck against this man for his share in the raids into Kej in 1901. The Governor-General issued a proclamation that all who befriended Umar Khan would be liable to punishment, and ordered his arrest if he should again appear in Persian territory. He had, meanwhile, fled to Afghanistan. In spite of this, Muhammad Umar g'ot back to Banjan in Ladis at the end of 1902, was helped by everybody, the local Persian authorities prohibiting a native officer of the Chageh Levies fiom proceeding to arrest him, while he was in Persian territory. He eventually got back to Afghan territory, and is still there a free man. This incident illustrates the weak ness, to say nothing else, of the administration on the Persian side of the border. In April last, the Levy Duffadar at Ladgasht reported that one Mirza Muhammad, the tax-collector of the Russian Government', had arrived at Ladgasht from Jalk, with a view to realising duty from one Kiya Khan, Reki, on certain exports from Jalk. Kiya Khan had left Ladgasht, so the Mirza sent a letter after him and returned. Importance was lent to the visit by the fact that Mons. deHoedt, a Belgian Customs oflicer, was in the locality, on the Persian side of the border at the time, there was a suspicion that the visit was instigated by him, and that it was really with a view to examining the Mashkhel-Jalk frontier, about which it was believed by Captain Webb Ware that there was some local misunderstanding. We sanctioned the appointment of a native agent at Ladgasht, and ruled that, while Persian Customs officials should be civilly treated, if they occasionally cross the frontier, it should be made perfectly clear lo all concerned that, on the British side of the frontier, Persian authority is to be in no way recognised, and no dues are to be paid; moreover, the Persian officials were to be given most distinctly to understand that they are not competent to cross the border for purposes connected with their official duties. We have since heard that Mons. deHoedt (in Sep tember) intended visiting Jalk, Bampusht, Diz, Panjgur, Pishin, and Gwettar; showing that the Belgians are taking special interest in this part of the country. One of the most important arrangements come to between Major Showers and the Governor-General of Kerman was that the Nazim of Makran and the Deputy Governor of Bampur should meet every year on the Perso-Baluch border for the settlement of pending cases. They met for the first time in January 1903, and a good many cases were disposed of. While the meeting was in progress, certain Persian subjects of Gwettar crossed over to Jewni to evade paying revenue due. The Deputy Governor asked the assistance of the Nazim, and the latter sent one or two of his men with Persian officials to Jewni, to help recover the revenue. This was at first represented as a violation of British territory; but the above are the true facts. Secretary noted that the Nazim's conduct was injudicious, and the incident seemed to show that we wanted something more than a Khan's Naib on the frontier. Another important arrangement oome to between Major Showers and the Governor- General of Kerman was the continued garrisoning of border forts by Persian troops. The Persian Government agreed to station troops at Irafshan, but during the past summer the Nazim reported that the Governor-General of Kerman had withdrawn the garrison, and transferred both fort and district to the old owner, Mir Azam Khan. The latter was intimately connected with Muhammad Umar, Nausherwani, and is an objectionable character. The effect of the transfer of the fort to him is that this border Alsatia will no longer be closed as a refuge to lawless characters. The Government of India addressed the British Minister, Tehran, on the subject on the 1st September 1903, and requested him to represent to the Persian Government the advisability of retaining the Persian garrison at Irafshan in the interests of both Govern ments and in accordance with the arrangements come to last year. A report in the Baluchistan Agency Diary for the week ending the 16th September 1903 says that Mir Shah Jehan has completely restored the Magas Fort, which was destroyed by Major Showers and the Governor-General of Kerman when they were on the border. He is said to have paid the Sartip Rs. 3,500 for permitting him to do so. If true, this is another breach of the arrangement between the Governor-General and Major Showers, and enquiries are being made about this. At the present moment there is open rebellion at and around Jalk. The Deputy Governor of. Bampur arrived in Dizak to collect revenue in August last. Sardar Abdulla Khan resisted payment, and some of Sardar Sir Nauroz Khan's men went to his assistance. J 7 £ ^ I ivVp*’ 'L. | ^ i (2 Complaints were made about tbis, and we told Colonel Yale that, if he were satisded that Sw NaZz Khan was a party to the despatch of his men, the d,sp ensure of Government was to be fonveved to him. Sir Nauroz disclaims all knowledge of the fact; says the men must have been Lnt by bis Naib at Ladgasht, and promises to bring the latter to account and withdraw his men. . . The Deputy Governor has attacked several forts, and there have been many casualties on both sides. Several Jalk people, among whom is Jihand Khan, Damam, have taken refuge in Mashkhel'to escape the oppressions of the Deputy Governor and his troops. Our latest news is that the Deputy Governor having run short of ammunition, has been compelled to retire from Jalk without having reduced the people to obedience or realised his revenue demands * Madad Khan, brother of Sardar Abdulla Khan, has attacked Mirza Muhammad the Belgian Customs officer, near Kalagan. Three of the Mirza’s men were shot dead the Mirza himself was wounded, and his camels and belongings fell into the hands of Madad Khan. Trouble seems to be impending, too, at Kuhak. Formerly there was a Persian Kotwal in charge of the place. During the past summer, according to information furnished to Major Sykes by the Governor-General of Kerman, the Kotwal was turned out and Mir Ghulam Muhammad, who professes to be a British subject and under this excuse has long been a thorn in the side of the authorities of Persian Baluchistan, came to the fort and took possession. Wali Khan, the Governor of Persian Baluchistan, reported to the Governor-General of Kerman that about 2,000 people had congregated round Kuhak, and he feared complications; and he added that, if Mir Ghulam Muhammad was not a British subject, he would go with troops and eject him. We telegraphed to the Political Resident, Bushire on the 26th October, requesting him to authorise Major Sykes to tell the Governor-General that, if Ghulam Muham mad disobeys the orders of the Persian authorities, he may be expelled. E. H. S. Clarke, —8-11-03. We have also heard from Mr. Newcome Wilson who visited Kuhalc in the middle of the summer of 1903 that the Khan said that six Russians had recently visited Kuhak and that they did not the Central persian line to travel by that route. Recent reports further state that the P. A., Kalat and the A. P. A., Chagai, state that a person disguised as a fakir or as a man of florid complexion has been moving along to Diask, Surkur and Kuhak districts and making surveys* Foreign Office Frees—No. 1452-9.11-03—6.Visit of a Persian Customs official to Ladgasht 0 : The Hon 'hie the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan reported in May 1903, that a Persian Customs official visited Ladsasht in British territory for the purpose 7of recovering from Mir Khan Reki duty on certain produce was paid by the Persian official while the Belgian Customs official, M. d’Hoedt was actually a£ Jalk or had just left it. The inference seemed irresistible that the subordinate had acted in accordance with instructions received from his superior officer. The matter was brought to the notice of His Britannic Majesty 1 s Minister who referred the matter to M. Haus the chief Customs official of the Persian Government, M, Baus was of opinion that his agents might, without violating our rights, endeavour to collect, in British or Poreign territory, 'by amicable means', export duties, the payment of which had been evaded by persons residing in Persian territory and pro mised to write to M. d'Hoedt for a report of the circumstances under 4 which the subordinate had visited Ladgasht, Meanwhile Government have sanctioned the permanent appointment of a Munshi at Ladgasht which it is hoped will afford means for ascertaining any further similar irregularities. Sir Arthur Hardinge has also been asked if M. Baus has furnished him with the result of the enquiries which he promised to make and M. d’Hoedt who, early in September last, had given out that he intended visiting Jalk, Bampusht, Pishin, Gw£tti,r, Dispur, and Panjgur, the last two of which are in British territory will be watched while in British territory or on the border, if he actually carries out his programme.Withdrawal hy the Persians of the Persian garrison in the Irafahan Port, : 0 : With a view to the maintenance of order on the Perso- Baluch horder, it was arranged last year with the Persian Government that Persian troops should he stationed at Irafahan. It was one of the results of the meeting 'between Colonel Showers and the Governor General of Kerman, and was the Governor General’s own idea. The arrangement was duly carried out, but some time during this summer, probably May or June, the Persian garrison was withdrawn, and the fort and district were trans ferred to their old owner, Mir Azam Khan, whose antecedents show him to be a person undeserving consideration* Sir A. Hardinge was accordingly asked on the 1st September 1903 to inform the Persian Government of the facts and to represent the advisability of retaining the garrison at Irafahan: in the interests of both Governments* Sir A. Hardinge»s reply is awaited*Alleged violation of.territory at Jewni : 0 : It appeared from entries in the diaries of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that there had been a violation of Indian territory at Jewni by the visit to that place of certain Persian officials about February 1903 in order to exact fines from GwettOr people who had taken refuge at Jewni. Enquiry was made from the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan from which it appears that when the Nazim of Makran and the Deputy Governor of Bampur were engaged in their /joint annual settlement of Border cases, ipsome Persian subjects crossed over to Jewni to evade paying revenue due. The Nazim on being asked for assistance in the matter by the Deputy Governor sent one or two of his men with Persian oi^icials Jewni. There was no violation of territory. Secretary s note of 10th October 1903 ordered the case to be brought up at GwetturSeistan affairs. 0 During the past summer rumours have been prevalent in Seistan that the Persian Government intended to lease all Seistan Khalsa lands to the Russian Bank, and that the super vision of revenue arrangements was to be made over to Belgian officials. On these rumours being brought to the notice of the Grand Vizier by Sir A. Hardinge, the latter received emphatic assurances in repudiation of any such intentions on the part of the Persian Government. During the present month the Hi ssian Bank is said to have been in negotiation with the Governor- General of Khorasan for the purchase of the Government share of of the current season's grain crop in Seistan. The Hashmat-ul- Mulk said that he had been told by the Governor-General of Khorasan that unless he paid the Government share of the produce at a rate higher than that at which it had hitherto been accept ed, the whole quantity, 15,000 Tabriz Kharwars, would be sold to the Bank. The British minister at Tehran urged the Persian Government to forbid the sale. Mr. Grant Duff reports by tele gram on the 1st November that stringent orders have been sent to the Governor-General of Khorasan to forbid the sale. He adds that the Persian Government do not believe that such a sale was ever in contemplation. Reports have also been current as to the determination of the Russians to obtain the recall of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. Sir Arthur Hardinge was instructed, by His Majesty's Government and asked by the Government of India, to use every effort to prevent such a step, and to accord his most vigorous support to to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. He promised to do so, adding that he had been supporting the Kashmat. The latest report says that the Russians are executing a volte face with the object of persuading the Hashmat that it is Russian influence that is keeping him in power.1/ The further history of the cade as to the Hashmat is that the Viceroy telegraphed asking that a strong protest should he made against a renewed attempt to displace the Hashrnat and His Majesty’s Government directed Mr. Grant Duff to use His Excellency’s arguments. Mr. Grant Duff suggested he should postpone this strong protest till His Excellency should have left Persian waters hut he has heen directed on the 18th November to carry out the previous orders.Seistar Bou: dary dispute. &gt; : 0 : Colonel McMahon informed us of the definition of his boundary line between Koh—i-halik Scab and Seah Koh in his Pro- 75 letter/l *°- 824 dated tlie 16th June 1903. It was communicated V-Jv*’ ^ 11g t0 the Persian Government, who, however, refused to accept luuo, 1* 82 • it without the condition tlmt the Afghans should promise that they would not destroy or in any way interfere with the Kuhak bund • Colonel l,c ahon informed the Persian Commissioner that he absolutely declined to allow his proposed line to be coupled witn any condition whatever, also, t]tat v he declined to discuss water questions until t e boundary question was' disposed of » a i’ ter which, all water questions would be fully discussed. The Persian Co miss loner informed the Mushir-ed-Bowleh accord ingly. 1 After much telegraphic correspondence between Tehran and Beistan, hr. Irani Ttuff telegraphed to Colonel McMahon on one 1st hlovember 190- , that the Mushir-ed-Do\/leh lie.d Instructed oM.e Yam i n© - i - Hi z am to accept Colonel McMahon’s boundary line, without conditions as regards water questions, and had expressed •me hope that the Commissioners would give their attention to the water question after the boundary line is settled.Proceedings of tlie Persian Customs Department in Seistan. : o : Several cases have recently been reported by the Consul in Seistan and the Consul-General at Meshed, showing the differential treatment accorded by the Belgian Customs authori ties in Seistan to Russia and British goods, and the vexation and trouble, generally caused to British traders. Sir A. Hardinge has been addressed, with a view to an energetic protest being made to the Persian Government and the papers have from time to time, been reported to the Secretary of State. At present a reply is being awaited from M. Naus to a communica tion addressed to him by Sir A. Hardinge in accordance with the Government of India’s wish that a protest should be made. The latest papers are under transmission to the Secretary of State General Postal diff icult ie s The chief complaints against the Belgian Customs officers in Seistan seem to be the following:- (l) They were directed to help the Yamin-i-Uizam, who was apparently sent there to thwart British influence, and to seek his assistance when necessary. T (2) M. Maurice apparently tried to interfere as much as he could with our Consular postal arrangements. (3) They produced as much friction as they could about the opening of the international post, even going so far as to detain our Consular bag; ttab they insisted on inaugura ting this without orders from Tehran when neither they nor we were in a position to establish an effective service. To open their postal service they took over all the the Baluch Sowars previously employed by the P-enaians- under Passamad Khan. ^ (5) Maurice wrote % most intemperate and insolent let- -• ter$to Major Berih,although he has been directed to withdraw these and apologise he has not as yet done so. Customs ar rangements • (1) They have hampered our traders in every way they can (i) insisting on invoices in French or Persian(ii) Suddenly enhancing the rate from 3.5 krans to 3.85 krans per rupee,though this is contrary t o the treaty. (iii) 'Forcing them in the summer when the roads in Seistan ^re almost impassable owing to the canals to come right up to Nasratabad when they are going to Birjand or Meshed and would pass ordinarily round the southern end of the Hamun. £lv) Arbitrarily fining traders or confiscating their animals for dljeged infraction of rules not published about routes and demand^deposit/ of customs duties on such animals (v) General bribery. * X. /vx /- K (vi) JKtlt^eatment of Mc^SudN^ilbar, Brhmh&gt;453^bjects^^ at Turbot i Haidat?lfor which h ow e v e rN^a r guz; a r was punished iftejr^long struggle. (vii) Refusal to recognise the good offices of our Consul on behalf of Afghans. (viii) Arbitrary classifications of goods and levy of duty on gross weight of packages in case of tea.until special remonstrances are made. 4i:M&gt; 7. Imposition of new posts on the Perso ^aluch frontier, south of Koh i Malik Siah^though these are not required for customs purposes as M. Molitor himself reported. 8. Extraordinary proceedings at Ladis by M. Cesari in firing on Jamadar Ido without any excuse. For this he has received no punishment but was merely trans.i,erred i rom Seit&gt;tan as it was considered sufficient to start with a clean slate. 9. Constant interference with the export of supplies for the Nushki trade route posts on one pretext or another, such as that the Tabriz and not the Seistan Kharwar should be the measure of weight while free export of animals to Trahs- caspia is permitted. 10. Seizure of supplh® 53 purchased for our Mission under telegram of 2©th January 1903 by M. Naus ordering strict enforcement of prohibition of all export. This he said was illicit . directed against ail trade by Hashmat-ul-Mulk and Sirdar Purdil Khan, T?ut the order was enforced in the most insolent way whichv might easily have led to a collision. The only reparation granted is that M. ISaus says that he will not renew M. Maurice's engagementjbut it is well known in Seistan that M. Maurice does not wish to renew this. (ii) Sudden stoppage of supplies for our Consulate by the Hashmat during Banjar disturbances on the alleged order of the Customs officials which M. Maurice would not disprove. We know that till McMahon's Mission arrived our Consulate was constant ly boycotted^and Msjor Benn had the greatest difficulty in get- ting any supplies. Sir A. Hardinge's despatch of the 19th September 1903 gj_Y©s his views of these complaints. hiU K .? ^ (J? L. W.

It is sent into Camp for reference, or in case His Excellency the Viceroy takes up the question with Sir A. Hardinge. Briefly the case is as follows. In Au ;ust last, Mr. Dobbs reported that Colonel iThyte informed him that a special passport officer was on his way to Seistan, and that the British Minister said that Mr. Dobbs was to passive resistance. The Karguzar told Mr. Dobbs that the rigorous insistance on passport r&lt;les was to be enforced, and Mr. Dobbs informed us that this was a deliberately unfriendly plan to hamper British tr-^de, and to force Afghans to trade with Russia on the north, instead of Persia and India. We addressed His Majesty's Secretary of State on the subject by telegeam on the 28th August 1903. As tending to confirm the view of Mr. Dobbs, just at this time the Seistan Customs refused to recognise British intervention on behalf of Afghans. The question of our right to protect Afghans came under consideration; Sir A. Hardinge thought that in customs matters we could certainly claim to Telegram extend our good offices to them, and the Viceroy, who preferred to Secre -tary of not to address the Amir until further experience of the situa- State, dated the tion had been gained, considered that e should for the present 12th Sep -tember merely repeat previous instructions to Consuls to make friendly 1903. representations to local and customs authorities on behalf of Afghans, particularly in C stoms matters, and to report any irregularities practised against Afghans. This view was accepted by His Majesty's G-overnim nt, and on the 16th September 1903, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs instructed Sir A. Hardinge to urge that Customs officials should be told to entertain friendly representations of British Consuls on behalf of Afghans; and he was also told to repeat instructions to ConsulsO' CO I &lt;+ f I ‘ v Con»ul» to mke «uoh friendly reprosentatioiiB to local fuid Custom.' officials whenever necesrary. ^ir A, Ifeirding:© has no nelief in the idea that the pasnport scheme is any part of a Russian intrigue to injure ^_.eur... .traders* He., is assured that no changes are to be made in ijLfl.

The Agent to the Governor General in reply communicated a report from the Political Assistant, Chagai, stating that the water was certainly giving out but that it was comidenuly exoected that other water could be found near Badshah^ &gt; The Agent to the g Governor General said he would forward a further report from the Political Assistant, Chagai, on the q lojecu* Deputy Secretary (P) Por approval.

But the case is not one in which His Excellency is likely to have any discussion with Sir A. Hardinge, and a note is therefore not really necessary. The Central Persian Telegraph line is, of course, quite different. (Sd.) E. H. S. Clarke - 2-11-1903Question of H*B«M*s Consul for Seiatan and iCaln corresponding direct with. H*B*M*s Minister at Tehran. 0 Captain KamsayjH.B.lPs Consul for Seistan and Kain has recently proposed that all telegrams and communications from the Consulate should he addressed direct to H.B.M's Minister at Tehran,copies being sent for information of the Consul General Meshed,as the present system of corresponding through the Consul General is very inconvenient, H.E.the Viceroy is disposed to agree to the pr oposal and will mention the matter to Sir A.Hardinge.\ (y /b ( Russian quarantine Cordon in Khorasan, and establish ment of a British Consuls.te at Turbat-i-Haidari• 0 V The Russian sanitary cordon in Khorasan v;as first instituted in 'February 1897, v/hen the first serious outbreak of plague occurred at Bombay. Since that date a more or less rigorous supervision has been enforced against all arrivals from Bdluchistan, and frequent complaints have been received from British Indian and Afghan traders of unnecessary delays caused by, and vexatious interference on the part of, the officers and men of the Russian quarantine posts. In view of the fact that there is no plague in Baluchistan, and that the Persian Government have repeatedly objected to the presence of the Cordon in Khorasan, His Majesty's Government recently represented to the Russian Government that the Cordon was neither required nor justified by expediency, and that it was, moreover, interfering with British Indian trade in that quarter. To this remonstrance the Russian Government replied in July last that it was impossible for them to withflraw the sanitary cordon, on the ground that the introduction of plague was threatened from the Persian coast, and that as all the trade routes converged in. that quarter it was essential for them to maintain their cordon at its present strength. His Majesty's Government accordingly decided to des patch a British officer as Consul to Turbat-i-Haidari, with a medical officer and an escort of 25 Native Indian Cavalry. The Consul's duties will be to watch and report on Russian proceedings, and to safeguard British Indian and Afghan inter ests. Captain C. B. Winter has been selected for the post of Consul, and Captain J. W. Watson, I.M.S., for that of medical officer. They have left Quetta for Turbat-i-Haidari,Dispute between Muhammad, a farash of the Indc- Persian Telegraph Department and a Persian serv nt of the Busslan Consulate-General# : o —- I n ’case it was reported that, in a quarrel hich arose between a Persian servant of Mr. McLachlan of the Indo)European Telegraph Department and a Pe- lan clerk of the Bnoaian Consulate General, the former was said to have spoken disrespectfully of the Russian Consul General. Mr. McLachlan, on being complained to, apologised for hin servant*s alleged misconduct, and. fined him. In spite of this, the Russian Consulate-General insisted on the man being summoned before the Kargusar* 8 Court and punished further. The man has taken refuge in the British Consulate-General and the Consul-General refuses to ;ive him up for trial, in which course he is being supported by His majesty*a Minister at Tehran* The case is at present forming the subject of correspondence between His Majesty*a and the Persian Governments. His Majesty's Government aavo told Sir A. Hardinge that, while opposed to any idea of surrendering the man for imprisonment, they consider that he should try to come to some amicable agreement with the Persian minister i or Foreign Affairs, and avoid giving too much weight to an incident of smll importance.PERSIAN LOAR. A loan of £ 300,000 has been authorised by the British Government to Persia, but so far as our information goes, £ 200,000 only has been actually drawn. The Government of India have provided the whole sum subject to a guarantee from His Majesty's Government against loss on the transaction to the extent of one half of the amount involved. 2. The nominal lender is the Imperial Bank of Persia through whom the loan has been made in two instalments. The agreement between the Bank, the Persian Grand Vizier and M. Naus is dated the 4th April 1903 and relates to the first instalment of £ 200,000. The rate of interest is per annum and the advance is repayable in twenty years, capital and interest, out of the royalties on the Caspian fisheries and if these should prove insufficient to secure regular repayment of the advance, deficits are to be made good out of the revenues of the Posts and Telegraphs and in case these are not sufficient, out of the revenues of the Customs of Ears and the Persian Gulf. 3» The payment of the balance of £ 100,000 was sanctioned by His Majesty's Government on the 11th July 1903. The capital sum is repayable in twenty equal annual instalrnents^of £ 5,000 a year. The interest is 5 ^ P er annum and the?guarantee for h the due repayment of capital and interest is the customs receiptjpof Ears and the Persian Gulf. 4 . The expression 'Ears and the Persian Gulf' has not been defined. The Government of India interpret it as an equivalent for Southern Persia and the Persian Government's reply to a request for a clear definition is vague. Hov/ever, His Majesty's Government decided to complete the loan ^and then to draw up, in consultation with the Government of India a statement which is to be placed before tne Persian Government of the interpretation they (His Majesty's Government) place upon the engagements undertaken by the Persian Government towardstowards them. If Persia attempts to ignore the engagements, His Majesty’s Government will take steps to secure British rights. Importance is attached to Mohammerah Being included in the definition 'Pars and the Persian Gulf”.to') Importance of the Imperial Bank of Persia to British interests in that country* —- ~ : 0 : The Imperial Bank of Persia is recognised as practi cally the only agency hy means of which we can prevent the Persian Governrmt from being entirely financed by Russia, It was through the medium of this bank, which was nominally the lender, that the BriUsh loan to Persia was recently effected. Sir Arthur Hardinge has suggested that the British Government should purchase a sufficient number of shares in the institution to ensure our obtaining a controlling voice in its management. The Secretary of State has been addressed on the subject and asked that enquiries may be made as to the manner in which the shares are now held and as to the possibility of any consider able purchase being made on Russian behalf without the British authorities receiving due warning in time to intervene. The Secretary!©f^State has also been asked to obtain a copy of the Charter of the Bank, the deed of settlement made thereunder and the Regulations. Meanwhile the Russian Minister is reported to intend, in the event of any further loans being made by us in the name of the Imperial Bank to the Persian Government, to raise the question of the Bank's lending powers in relation to its capital, under the charter, and His Majesty's Minister at Tehran has suggested that the clause in the cdn- Session limiting the powers of the Bank on this score should either be modified or struck out.Russian telegraphists in Persia : 0 i In the beginning of October, 1903, we heard from the Intelligence Branch that the Russian Government had sanctioned appointment in the previous June, the of eight Postal Telegraph officials for employment in Persia* We asked Sir A. Kardingc by telegraph if he had heard anything of the natter and he replied (19th October) that the Russian Legation had long had a telegraphist attached to it, and that the new men might be intended for similar duties in Russian Consulates, or perhaps at places on our line. Sir A. Hardinge has since seen the Russian Minister, and ascertained that it is proposed to station the telegraphists at various places where Russian ConsinLates e^ist, Urumia, Tabriz, Seistan, Meshed and Kerman were e mentioned, the .Minister expressly saying that he had obtained leave from the Persian Government to have one at the latter place. This, the Kushir-ed-Dowleh denies and says the Persian Government have refused to allow Russian telegraphists at fezd , and Kerman. The Russian Minister has told the Mushir-ud-Dowleh j that Sir A. Hardinge acquiesced in the appointment of Russians 5 at those places (which is untrue), and Sir A. Hardinge has reiu- ted the statement. The Russians are pressing the case, and it ] is understood that their demand in a reply to the employment by us of two English signallers on the Seistan-Meshed line. Sir A. Hardinge has explained to the Persians the difference between the purely Persian Government line to Seintan, md lines established under convention with Great Britain* The Hunhir-ud- Dov/leh is trying to put the Russians off with evasive answers, and to get a promise from the British Minister that our signal lers shall be withdrawn from Seistan on the completion of the work of the Seistan Commission* Sir A. hardinge reiused oo give any such promise, and said he thought we should insist hint as long as any Russian telegraphist was employed on, tne Seistan line, whether in Persian or Russian service, equal treatment should( &gt;0 7 should 'be dealt out to u»* It is very desirable that the Russians should he prevented from stationing telegraph officials at offices on the British line, and it is to he hoped that the Persian Government . will not he allowed to concede the Russian demand.

Barker, or by the hhursac Lad is line recommended by Major dykes, or by the Nasratabnd Ispe route proposed by hr*. Dobbs. Colonel Lchahon has forwarded a Surveyor's report which shows that the Baluchab route (hoh-i-Malin ...iah to Nasr&amp;tabac Ispe) is an easy one for a telegraph line* A report has also been received from Major -y/cs, Kerman Ztvlnz the advantage of the Shurgas route as against the Henjira alignment, if a direct line to juetta is required. Mr* Barker has also expressed his opinion that the route from Hasratabad Icpe to F.oh-i- 'alik ^ iah is a matter of in difference but that the section wfrich he is anxious to avoid is that from Fahreh to Kasratabed Ispe. Colonel Mchahon was asked on the 31st October 1 G3 if he could arrange to send IT. hoore with a surveyor to ascertain particularsparticulars of this route and if poles «an be erected with no greater difficulties than on the Kushki rout© and if so to arrange with Lajor Sykes(for the men's journey). This may allow time for a reply to be received to the Grovernment of India telegram to bir a. Harding© dated the 16th October IS03 in which he was asked if the Persian Government would allow the Central Persia Telegraph to continue the line from Koh-i-Malik Siah to Seistan. It was said in the same telegram that we presumed, that If the PersianXpreferred to build it, the British Government could claim the sane privileges and advantages as have been accorded to the Russians on the ISashad.Salttan line. Va have now received two despatches from the Secretary of State dated the 18th September and 8th October 1903 through the Public Works Department containing Mr. Kirk's views on the route for a telegraph line via Ku/ak and Las 3ela to India. He also gives his views on other routes to India. In a note en closed in the second despatch Mr. Kirk points out objections to any route via Ghurgaz being adopted for a telegraph line. The Gecretary of State asks for the ardar views of the Government of India by telegraph.CO rn fecret Despatch No. 53 Exterbal, datod the 7th Lay 1903. Se^JE.

McSWINEY, Captain, Deputy Assistant Quarter Master General, Western Section.INTRODUCTION. T HE notes contained in the following pages were collected during a short trip undertaken for the Intelligence Branch of the Quarter Master General's Department in India during the spring of 1896. Leaving Karachi on the 11th February in the British India Steam Navigation Company’s S.S. Java I proceed ed first to Bushahr, calling at the ports of Gwadar, Jask, Bandar Abbas, Lingah and the island of Bahren en route. One of my principal objects was to collect information regarding the position of the Turks and the strength of their garrisons in the Persian Gulf, and from Bushahr I went on to Basra, which is the head quarters of the Governor of the Province. On arrival there on the 22nd Feb ruary I found that Captain Whyte, the Assistant Political Agent and Consul, to whom I had previously written, had already obtained from the Wali permission forme to visit the district of El Hasa, together with a letter to the authorities there, directing them to afford me assistance. This was a piece of good fortune which I had not hoped for. No Englishman had, as far as I know, visited this country for at least 30 years, on previous occasions when permission had been asked for it had always been refused, and it was due mainly to Captain Whyte’s personal influence with the Wali that I was allowed to go. I therefore decided to return as soon as possible to Bahren and cross over from there to the Arabian Coast, hoping that the information I could obtain would compensate for the delay involved. The mail steamers, as a rule, only call at Bahren once a fortnight, and I had to wait at Basra till the 5th March before 1 could get a boat back. During this enforced interval I was most hospitably entertained by Captain Whyte, and was enabled to collect a certain amount of information regarding the position of affairs in this part. I finally reached Bahren again on the 8th March, and on the 9th crossed over in a native boat to the port of Katif, with the intention of going from there into El Hasa and return ing by way of Ajer. I landed at Katif on the morning of the 10th, but found unfortunately that the Turkish Kaimakam was absent, his place being filled by the Kazi, an old Arab, to whom I presented my letters. He was quite polite and gave me a room in a house in the bazar, and told me that a caravan was starting that evening w r hich I could accompany. I had, however, yet to experience the methods of Turkish authorities w r hen they wish to be obstructive. After hiring transport, for which I paid in advance, and arranging to start with the caravan at 5 P.M., I was somewhat annoyed when in the afternoon the man brought me back my money and said he could not take me as the road was unsafe. This was of course only an excuse, and on enquiry 1 found out that the Arab merchant, to whom the caravan belonged, was afraid that my presence might get him into trouble, and was determined that 1 should not go with him: In vain I tried to hire other transport, they all refused to take me. I was unable to get hold of the merchant, and meanwhile the caravan left without me. Next day I again went to the Kazi and asked him to arrange for me to go on by myself. He then informed me that the road was very unsafe, that he had not enough troops at his disposal to give me a sufficient escort, and that he could not be responsible for my safety by that road, but that I had better go to Ajer and go on from there. One of the stipulations made by the Wali of Basra was that i must be guided in my movements by the wishes of the authorities on the ■spot, and after a vain attempt to induce the Kazi to change his mind, I had no choice but to go to Ajer and make a fresh start from there. From Katif to Ajer is only about 60 miles along the coast, but wind and sea were against us all the way, and leaving Katif late on the 12th, I did not finally reach Ajer till the even ing of the 15th, the intervening time being spent somewhat uncomfortably tossing about in a small native boat. On arrival at Ajer my boat was at first waved off from the landing stage by an official, and it was not till my papers had been care fully scrutinised that I was allowed to land. A very dirty room in the “ Khan” was then given me, while a copy of my letters from the Wali was sent off to the authorities at Hofhuf. On the 17th a reply was received in the shape of an escortn of i mounted Zaptiehs under an officer sent to fetch me, and next morning I started at day-break, and covering the 40 miles of loose sand which separates the cul tivated district from the coast, reached an outlying village of Hasa in the evening. Hofhuf was reached early the next day, and there I was provided with a. room in the Government “ Mihmankhana,” where, though treated with great hospitality, I was always surrounded by the official element and communication with the Arab merchants was rendered extremely difficulty Leaving Hofhuf again on the 20th I reached Ajer on the 21st and embarking next day arrived at Bahren on the 23rd. Here 1 found Mr. Gaskin, our Vice-Consul at Bushahr, and H. M.’s Gun-boat Lapiving, arranging the terms under which the boats captured during the late disturbances should be redeemed. From Bahren •! took the next mail back to Basra, reached on the 26th, and after spending 24 hours in quarantine, was fortunate enough to catch Messrs. Lynch’s river steamer to Baghdad next day. Owing to the flooded state of the river Baghdad was not reached till the 2nd April, and I was most hospitably entertained there by Colonel Mockler, the Political Resident and Consul-General. The desert round the city was at that time under water for some miles from the walls on every side, and ten days elapsed before 1 was able to collect transport and make a start on my onward journey. Finally, on the 13th April, I left Baghdad to pro ceed by the Euphrates Valley route to Aleppo, myself and transport, the latter consisting of two riding and three baggage horses, all having to be conveyed for to miles across the desert in boats. Including two days’ halt the journey from Baghdad to Aleppo occupied 23 days, a very good performance for horses, which, with the exception of feeds of corn at each of the towns of Hit and Dir, sub sisted during the journey entirely on the green grass vffiich grows abundantly along the route during the spring. No difficulties were encountered until within a hundred miles of Aleppo, when I had a somewhat unpleasant encounter with a small detached party of Turkish soldiers. These men formed part of the reserves which have lately been called out and, fresh from massacring Ar menians in the neighbourhood, were anxious to treat my servant and myself in the same manner as they had treated other Christians. After being some what roughly handled and spending an extremely uncomfortable half hour during which it was merely a toss-up whether they shot me or cut my throat, the latter course appearing the most probable one, I finally escaped with the loss of the small sum of money I had with me and a good deal of dignity. Next day I was fortunately able to join the caravan of a Turkish Pasha, who was travelling in the same direction, and reached Aleppo on the 5th May. After spending three days at Aleppo I went on to Alexandretta, the journey, which occupies two days, being accomplished in \ carriage. Finally, on the nth May, 1 embarked on one of the Egyptian Khedivial Company’s steamers for Alexandria, and touching at the ports of Mersina, Tripoli, Beyrout and Jaffa on the Syrian Coast, arrived at Alexandria on the 16th. At Alexandria I was delayed for four days owing to the cholera scare, all boats from Egyptian ports being full, and passages engaged for weeks in advance. 1 was, however, fortunate enough to secure a berth returned at the last moment and left on the 20th in a small Austrian Lloyd boat for Brindisi, crowded with passengers of every age and both sexes, mostly Jews of various nationalities. Brindisi was reached on the 23rd and London on the morning of the 26th May, 3-! months from the time I left India. During the wffiole of my trip I received every assistance and experienced the utmost hospitality from the Political and Consular Officers of the various places visited, and it is in a great measure due to their help that I was enabled to collect the notes which the following pages contain. J. A. DOUGLAS, Staff Captain, Intelligence Branch, Q, M. G’s. Dept. in India.SECTION 1 I. British India and other steamers in the Gulf. Persian ports— The Karun river—Bahrf.n and recent events there. The British India Steam Navigation Company have a weekly service of steamers from Karachi to the Persian Gulf. The ports touched at vary accord ing to the requirements of trade, but all land the mails at Jask, Bandar Abbas, Lingah, Bushahr, Fao, Muhammarah and Basra, while alternate boats go to Muskat and Bahren, and Gwadar is sometimes included. There is no good harbour among the Persian ports, nearly all of which are merely open anchorages where landing is at times very difficult. Though the distance from Karachi to Basra is only about 1,200 miles, the journey occupies from 9 to 11 days. About half of this is taken up in loading and unloading cargo at the various ports of call, and most of the actual moving from port to port is done at night. In addi tion to the British India steamers, another line, owned by natives, runs regularly from India up the Gulf. They are good boats and officered by Englishmen. Many other ships of various nationalities come direct from Europe to Basra, and the French Messageries Maritimes are trying to organise a regular service, chiefly, it is said, for political reasons. The first boat sent was found to have too great a draught to cross the bar at Fao and returned after taking only a moderate amount of cargo sent down the river on lighters. Gwadar, the first port reached from India, is a small village situated on the neck of a l-shaped promontory and can be approached either from the east or the west. In either case steamers must anchor some distance from the shore. There are post and telegraph offices there. At Jask there is a station of the Indo-European Telegraph Company and Jask. also a post-office, both situated at the end of a spit of land wnich juts out into the sea. C.ose by, between them and the mainland, is a small square Persian fort, built of mud bricks with bastions at the corners. It has no guns and the gar rison appears to consist of one solitary watchman at the mam entrance. e village is some way off. The town of Bandar Abbas lies on a lovy shore with a background of high Bandar Abbas, hills It is dirty and by no means imposing in appearance. The principal build- ino S are the custom-house and “ bandar,” with the Governor’s house close by. Owing to the numerous islands about, the anchorage appears to be almost land locked, but is a good deal exposed to south-east winds. 1 he water is shallow for about a mile from the shore, but landing here is usually easy. There are British and Persian post-offices, the latter running a regular service to Karman. Linanh in general appearance is very similar to Bandar Abbas, but the Lingah. anchorage is much more exposed. I here is a considerable trade with India, from both Lingah and Bandar Abbas. Bushahr, the centre of British Political influence in Southern Persia, is too Bushahr. well known to need description. The anchorage is in the open sea, about 3 miles north-west of the town, from which it is separated bv very shallow water. The prevailing winds are from the north-west (called “ Shammal”) and south-east, and with a strong breeze from either direction, communication between the ships and the shore is both difficult and uncomfortable. Bushahr is the head-quar ters of the Persian Navy, which consists of one small Gun-boat, the Persepohs. This vessel, on which the energies of the whole staff of the department of the Admiralty at Tehran are expended, is commanded by a German, who fills all the higher ranks of the Navy from Admiral of the Fleet downwards The officers and crew under him are Persian. The Resident’s despatch Boat Lawrence,^ the gun-boat usually stationed in the Persian Gulf, generally spend their time, when not cruising, between Bushahr and Basra. The only other Persian port at which steamers call is Muhammarah, situated Muhammarah. at the confluence of the Karun ri\er with the Shatt-ul-Arab LKthe resi dence of a British Vice-Consul, whose house and Messrs. Lynch and Company’s2 Karun river. Bahren, d Recent events. warehouses are on the right bank, while opposite to them are some empty Persian barracks. The native town is about miles higher up the stream. The Karun river is, commercially as well as strategically, one of the most important highways in Southern Persia. Flowing as it does through a fertile grain producing country, and navigable for a distance of over 100 miles to S bus tar by river steamers, it is only the vexatious embargo on the export of grain imposed by the Persian authorities which prevents its supplying a far larger quantity than is at present the case. If it were ever necessary for us to send a force into South-West Persia, the route gives facilities which no others possess and would most certainly be made use of. Messrs. Lynch and Company of Baghdad run one steamer, the Mai Amir, regularly between Muhammarah and Ahwaz, while, from above the rapids at the latter place as far as Shustar, ply their small stern wheel steamer, the Shushan, and another small boat, the Susa, owned by the local chief Shekh Misak In case of necessity the whole of the steamers and barges owned by Messrs. Lynch and Company could navigate the Karun as far as Ahwaz, at which place supplies and transport could be easily collected. Details of the steamers, etc., available for transport purposes are given on page 9. The island of Bahren, to which attention was particularly directed by the occurrences which took place last year, is about 30 miles long by 10 broad. For the most part it lies very low, the only high ground being an extinct volcano in the interior. The population is estimated at 120,000, of which the large towns of Manameh and Maharak each contain 25,000 ; there are about 20,000 at Had, a town to the east of and close to Maharak, with which it is connected at low water ; and the remainder occupy El Bidia and the smaller villages scattered over the island. All the large towns are at the north end of the island, and round them are ex tensive date-groves. With the exception of these and lucerne grass for fodder there is no cultivation of any sort. The majority of the population are engaged in the pearl-fishing industry, and they are entirely dependent on outside for their food supply. Rice is brought from India, wheat partly from India and partly from Persian ports and, in addition to that imported for the consumption of the inhabitants, large quantities are exported to the Arabian Coast. Rifles are also imported from England in considerable numbers, the value amounting to about a lakh of rupees a year. The monoply is at present in the hands of the British Residency Agent, a Persian merchant. They are mostly, if not all, Martini-Henry rifles and carbines, and are sold for about Rs. 100 apiece, nearly all of them finding their way across to the coast. A short account of recent events on and near the island may not be out of place here, as a recurrence of trouble is at least possible. The Katr peninsula to the east of the island is ruled by Shekh Jasim-bin-Thani, a rich and powerful chief, who has with him a following of about 2,000 fighting men. Some few years ago he was engaged in hostilities with the Turks, who have succeeded, after some hard fighting, in establishing a garrison in the fort of El Bidia on the eastern side of the peninsula, and reducing Jasim to nominal subjection. He is now Kaimakam of the_ peninsula under the Turks, flies the Turkish flag, and fears as much as he dislikes them. Jasim has an old standing feud with Shekh Isa of Bahren, who is under British protection, and in all intrigues against Bahren he has been strongly supported by the Bani Hajir Arabs of the &amp; Hasa Coast, the chief of whom is a cousin of Shekh Isa and has himself a claim to the island. Among all these tribes Bahren is always looked upon as a rich prize, and when that is the bait Jasim can always count on the assistance of the tribes on the Hasa Coast, unless the Turks, to whom they are nominally subject, actively interfere, which is of course in the highest degree improbable. These tribes can muster altogether about 4,500 fighting men, which, with Jasim’s 2,000, would give him altogether 6,500, but it is probable that the 4,500, which is the number he is estimated to have collected last year, represents as large a force as he is ever likely to bring together. Last year the Ali-bin-Ali tribe, which is one of the largest sections of the Bahrenis, had a quarrel with their Shekh, a woman being at the bottom of the affair. After several men had been’ killed on both sides, the Alhbin-Ali migrated in a body to the main land and settled under Shekh Jasim’s protection at the town of Zabara on the west coast of the Katr peninsula. Jasim, acting there is little doubt at the instigationy 3 of the Turks, seized the opportunity to interfere, and collected men to attack the island, while the Turkish authorities wrote to our Political Agent at Bushahr to say that they could no longer control him. It is evident that in acting thus the Turks had everything to gain and nothing to lose. In any case they would find out whether we really intended to protect Shekh Isa of Bahren ; if Jasim succeed ed in capturing and holding the island, it would eventually come under Turkish control; and if he was defeated his power, which is still considerable, would be broken. The following collected by Jasim amounted to about 4,500 men, about 15 per cent, of whom were armed with rifles, and boats were collected for a simul taneous attack on Bahren from four different points, including Zabara, Ajer and Katif. At this time the position in the island was somewhat critical, the people were panic-stricken, a muster of the defensive force produced an ill-armed and useless rabble of about 1,500 men, and it was only Captain Felly’s prompt action in finding and destroying the boats that prevented the attack from taking place. Owing to Shekh Jasim’s refusal to pay the fine inflicted by the British Gov- Troops necessary for ernment, and our subsequent action in allowing the owners of the boats, kept as P rotectio n in case security, to redeem them themselves, it is probable that these men will ’not be so o£attack ' ready to join their chief in another attack on the island. Should it be necessary, however, at any future period to send troops from India for the protection of Bahren, one native regiment would probably be ample for the work. As stated above the bulk of the population is collected at the northern end of the island the water here is fairly deep, and a gun-boat or two could easily protect the large towns from the sea side. The water which separates Bahren from the main-land to the south and south-east has never been properly surveyed, but it is in many places very shallow, and there is probably no channel by which a gun-boat could get round. So much so is this the case to the south-east that at low water it is said that a man can wade out for nearly 20 miles, and it is here if anywhere that there might be difficulty in preventing a hostile force from landing. On the other hand this part of the island is quite barren and sparsely populated, and little damage could be done. On the whole the best place to post a regiment would appear to be close outside the town of Manameh. Here there is 'an old fort, about 100 yards square, with high walls, bastions at the corners and a parapet round, in fairly good preservation, and the fort, which is quite empty inside, has open sandy ground round it and good water close by. Many of the poorer natives of the island live in huts, built of palm-branches, and such huts could be easily and quickly constructed for troops to live in, either inside the fort or, which would probably be better, on the sandy plain outside, using the fort itself for stores with the power of retiring into it, if necessary. A detachment in the neighbourhood of the large village of El Bidia might also be required. Troops would have to draw their supplies entirely from India.SECTION II. El H&amp;sa. Horses. Camels. Hofhuf. El Hasa and Turkish influence on the Western shore of the Persian Gulf. The country now occupied by the Turks on the Western Coast of the Persian Gulf comprises the fertile district of El Hasa or Ahsa wtth ,ts port of Aier, the coast town and district of Kat.f and the fortified port of El B.d.a on the Eastern Coast of the Katr peninsula. All this district is under a separate Gover nor, subordinate to the Wall of Basra, and bearing the proud title of Mutassanf of Naid. It is only some five and twenty years since the Turks first obtained a footincr in this part. Up to 1871 the country was under the rule of the Wahabis, but in that year the Wahabi ruler invoked the assistance of the Turks in a family quarrel and since then the districts of Katif and Hasa have never been without a Tuikish garrison. In 1886 the garrison consisted of about 200 men, but since then it has been gradually increased up to its present strength. From Hasa the Turks, not without some fighting, have extended their influence over the Katr peninsula, and doubtless their intention is to extend their power still further along the pirate coast. It would probably be more to our advantage than disadvantage if this coast were under some strong Government, who had the will and the power to keep the pirates, who infest this coast, in check, but this would be more than could be expected from the Turks, even if they occupied the country in consider able force. Their influence would be, as it now is in Katr, more nominal than real, with the result that the pirates, while under no control, would fly the Turkish flag’and claim the protection of the Ottoman Government, when it suited them to do so, thus hampering our efforts to keep them in check by the risk of causing complications with the Porte. The district of El Hasa proper consists of a fertile strip of country, lying some forty miles inland from the coast, from which it is separated by barren sandy desert. The portion actually inhabited by a settled population is about 15 miles long by 12 broad, watered principally by springs, and said to contain 30 villages. The whole of this tract is very fertile and covered with date-groves, the dates being highly prized for their flavour and forming almost the only article of ex port. Besides the dates, wheat and rice are growm in small quantities and abund ance of grass and very good lucerne for fodder, but for its grain supply the dis trict is almost entirely dependent on outside, all the rice coming from India through Bahren, and the wheat partly through Bahren and partly direct from Persian ports in native boats. The inhabitants owm cattle in fair numbers, donkeys, both of the w r hite Persian breed and the smaller donkey common to the east, are very plentiful; while sheep, camels and horses are easily obtained fiom the Bedouin tribes in the neighbouring desert. o o The horses to be found in the district vary from the pure-bred Arab to the common Kadish or bag^ige horse. The former are difficult to obtain and enormous prices are asked for them, but large numbers of good, serviceable animals, capable of doing a lot of w r ork on scanty food, may be got from the Bedouin tribes, prices varying from ro to 40 liras. This is the class ridden by the mounted Zaptiehs, and many of them show a good deal of breeding. When on a journey they get a feed of corn once a day, in the evening, and such grazing as they can find in the desert, their saddles are seldom removed, and under these conditions they will carry their riders too miles in three days wdth ease. The usual pace is a walk, wuth an occasional short gallop. Besides the ordinary baggage camels the Bedouins own many very good riding camels, which are capable of going enormous distances. Twenty liras is about the average price for a well bred camel, though they often fetch much larger sums. The principal town of El Hasa, and the head-quarters of the Turkish Govern ment, is Hofhuf, situated about 50 miles south-south-west of the port of Ajer.5 Like all the towns and villages in the district it is surrounded by a high wall in bad repair, and occupies a space about a mile long and half a mile in width. In one corner of the town is a keep or citadel also enclosed by high bastioned mud 'walls with a dry ditch. The keep is about a quarter of a mile square and in it are the barracks and residences of all the Turkish officials. Outside the citadel is the bazar, and the remainder of the town contains the bulk of the population, who here, as elsewhere in the district, live in flat-roofed mud-houses. Compared with other Arab towns Hofhuf has a clean and well-kept appearance and must contain a large population, but no estimates of the numbers in either the town or the district A could be formed. About 2 miles to the north of Hofhuf is Mubarraz, a large walled village, Mubarraz. said to contain a greater number of inhabitants than Hofhuf itself. Here are manufactured “ abbas ” or Arab cloaks for which the district is famous. The population of Mubarraz is entirely Arab. Another large village is Jafar, about 9 miles from Hofhuf on the road to Ajer, which is the residence of a Mudir. Ajer, or, as it is commonly called by the Arabs, Aker, is the port of Hasa. Ajer. and consists only of a “ Khan” or caravansarai, with the Mudir’s house, situated on the south-west of a large inlet of the sea. This inlet runs north-west and south-east, and the mouth is partially closed by a sand bank, leaving only a channel, some 200 or 300 yards broad, by which boats can enter. This channel, and the greater portion of the bay, is 3 to 4 fathoms deep, but the shallow water outside the inlet prevents ships from entering. The “ Khan ” which faces the sea is 150 yards long by 80 broad. The walls are 16 feet high and have sheds round the inside on three sides, leaving a parapet, 3 feet 6 inches high, on the top. There are entrances in the centre of the front and rear faces On the south side there is merely a high wall, and close outside it is the Mudir’s house, a forti fied building, with bastions at the corners, but old and dilapidated. This house entirely commands the interior of the “ Khan.” The only inhabitants of Ajer, besides tbe Mudir, are the customs-house officials and the garrison, which consists of 30 men of the gendarmerie (infantry) under an officer. There are usually 3 or 4 native boats in the harbour, and a fairly constant traffic is carried on, chiefly by means of camels, over the 40 miles of desert which separates the port from the cultivated tract. The town of Katif is situated on an inlet of the coast about 37 miles north- Katif. west of the island of Bahren. It consists of an old fort facing the sea, which contains about half the population, and a straggling town outside the fort on the south side. The fort, which is said to have been built by the Wahabis, about 360 years ago, has high bastioned walls, with a gateway facing the sea and another on the south side leading to the town. Its frontage is about 400 yards and depth 300, but both the walls and the greater portion of the houses in the interior are in a very dilapidated condition. Inside the fort is the “ sarai” or public offices, but most of the richer inhabitants live outside, where the bazar is also. In fact only the portion of the interior nearest the sea appeared to be occupied, the houses in the other part having mostly fallen down. Extending for some distance round the town on the land side are extensive date-groves and cultivated land, but here, as at Hasa, large quantities of grain are imported from outside. Katif is part of the territory ruled by the Mutassarif of Najd, who is re presented there by a Kaimakam. There are a few other Turkish officials in the customs, etc., and a garrison of about 80 gendarmerie, but the Kazi and subor dinate officials are Arabs, and the people seem to be left pretty well to themselves as long as they pay their revenue. The population was variously estimated at from 5,000 to 12,000. They complain very much of the exaction of the Turks and the’large amount of revenue which they have to pay. The distance from Katif to Hofhuf is about 90 miles. This is mostly desert, but w r ater and fuel are said to be procurable at all halting places along the road. The journey can be done in three days, but caravans take longer. Raids on caravans are by no means infrequent, and travellers either take police escorts or arrange with the Bedouin tribes for a safe conduct. The harbour is very shallow, so much so that native boats can enter or leave only at high water. The police hold a small post of observation at Anich to the south of the town and another on the island.6 Garrison of district. L Zaptiehs. Officials. Currency. The total garrison of the district consists of 4 battalions of Nizam infantry 2 buluks (a buluk= 100 men) or squadrons of cavairy, a battery of artillery, 6 buluks of gendarmerie (Zaptiehs). 4 of which are mounted and a special corps of 50 Bedouins, armed with snider rifles and mounted on camels, whose duty is to act as guides, etc. One battalion of infantry are quartered at El Bidia on the east coast of the Katr peninsula, with this exception the ^whole of the regular troops are at Hofhuf. They form part of the VI Army Corps, and are relieved periodically by fresh troops from Baghdad. The official returns show a mountain battery in Hasa, but it appears to consist of 6 light guns on carriages drawn by mules. The gendarmerie or Zaptieh* force consists of men specially raised for service in this district. Their duties are those of an armed police, and they are scattered in small posts over the populous parts of the districts for the main tenance of order, and also form escorts for caravans and travellers. The organi sation of the mounted branch is much the same as that of our Indian native cavalry, i.e., they receive their arms and Rs. 30 per month and find their own horses', etc. Government only supplies uniform and rifles (snider). One of the four mounted buluks consists entirely of Kurds, raised and commanded by a Kurdish chief, who draws the pay of 100 men and enlists, mounts and equips them himself. These men had been at the time of my visit over 3 years in the country, and their chief was anxious to return to his own home, but was not allowed to do so. The other 3 buluks are mixed Arabs and Kurds. These men are mounted on serviceable horses, are partially drilled, and would in case of war be useful as irregular cavalry, the Kurds being especially suited for this sort of work. In other parts of Turkish Arabia the Zaptiehs are more split up in posts of three or four men, and their duties then approach more nearly to those of our Indian Border Police. They are on much the same terms with the robbers of the neighbourhood as the latter, and it is their presence with the traveller which pro tects him, rather than any resistance they would be likely to offer in case of attack. The infantry Zaptiehs receive their uniform and arms and a salary of Rs. 15 per month from the Government, and their duties are also those of a semi- military police. They are armed with snider rifles, have little or no training, and as a fighting force are by no means formidable. The distribution of the Zaptieh force is as follows :— Katif ... ... ... ... 50 mounted and 30 foot. Ajer ... ... ... ... 30 foot. Katr peninsula ... ... ... 20 mounted. Remainder in the Hasa district, with head-quarters at Hofhuf. Here, as elsewhere in Turkey, the police are credited with an aptitude for extorting a good deal from the inhabitants in addition to their pay. As already stated the chief official in the district is the Mutassarif appoint ed from Constantinople, but subordinate to the Wali of Basra. Under him are the districts of Katif and Katr, which have separate Kaimakams, while Hasa itself is divided into the 4 Mudirliks of Ajer, Jafar, Hofhuf and Mubarraz. The principal duty of these officials is to collect the revenue and whatever else they can squeeze from the people for themselves. So long as revenues are paid and they keep quiet, the Arabs seem to be left pretty much to themselves, but no attempt is made to improve their condition or to develope the resources of the country. A year or two ago an attempt was made to introduce compulsory military service among the people of Katif, but they threatened if this were done to migrate in a body to Bahren and other parts of the coast, and the attempt was given up. The coinage of Hasa is peculiar to the district and somewhat puzzling to a newcomer. The coins in circulation are the Turkish pound or lira, the Maria Theresa dollar, the rupee, the tawilah, and small copper coins (pice) from India, • This word is sometimes more correctjy spelt Dhabitiah, but as it is always pronounced Zaptieh, I have adhered to this spelling. J. A. D.I 7 Maskat, Zanzibar, German and British East Africa. Of these the Maria Theresa dollars are coined specially for Arabia and parts of East Africa, and all bear the date, 1780. They are known as rials. The tawilah or long-bit has already been noticed by other travellers, and is one of the so-called fish-hook coins. It is merely a bar of copper shaped like a compressed Y with some Arabic characters stamped on it. These have not been coined for several hundred years, and Hasa is the only place in which they pass current. The rate of exchange in the spring of 1896 was as follows : 1 lira ... ... = 8 rids. \ rial ... ... = 60 tawilahs Rs. 1-14-0. 1 tawilah ... ... = 2 anna. In a country like this, where on every side outside the oases is a vast ex- Roads, panse of sand, the roads are merely tracks across the desert from well to well, and though those, over which the traffic is pretty constant, are in calm weather marked by the traces of the caravans which use them, yet they are apt to become obliterated by the high winds which frequently blow, and the services of a Be douin guide are almost always necessary. I he principal tracks leading to and from Hofhuf are the following :— Ajer to Hofhuf. —About 40 miles across the sand to the edge of the culti vation ; water sufficient but fuel scarce (see Appendix, Route No. 1). Katij to Hofhuf. —About too miles. Few particulars could be obtained about this road, but it is usually considered three days’ journey. Water and fuel are said to be everywhere plentiful, and the road is probably now in. much the same state as when traversed by Palgrave in 1863, and a portion of it at least lies, not over sandy desert, but over a country where water is found at no great depth below the surface, and which requires only a settled population to make it as fertile as the adjoining part of Hasa. Palgrave, however, states that, at the time of his visit, the road was perfectly secure, whereas now no Arab merchant would think of venturing without a sufficient escort. Hofhuf to Katr. — Distance about 120 miles. This track lies entirely over desert; water is procurable and the journey usually occupies 3 or 4 days. This is the road by which communication is maintained between Hofhuf and the garri son of El Bidia. Besides the above there is the track from Hofhuf to Riadh, which Palgrave travelled over. It is all over desert and water is scarce. The journey for cara vans occupies about ten days. , There is also a road from Hasa northwards to Koweit and thence to Basra, and when first the Turks occupied the country a portion of their troops made use of this. There are wells along the road,, but the Bedouin tribes are unfriendly, and the troops that used it had to fight their way. A fortnightly post goes oy this road to Basra, performing the distance in 12 days. In the districts of Hasa and Katif, and perhaps, though to a lesser Turkish authority, extent, in the southern part of the Katr peninsula, the authority of the Turks is firmly established. With the large military force at his disposal the Governor has no difficulty in keeping the poor agriculturists, who form the bulk of the population, well under control, and there is no doubt that the fear of the Turk is very real. At the same time it is not to.be wondered, at that, bullied as they are by the soldiers and oppressed by the higher. authorities, the people should look on their.masters with feelings the reverse of friendly. Among the rich merchants, who form the upper classes, the same feelings exist. M°st of these have dealings with Bombay, many of them have visited India, and they are as a rule, very well-disposed towards the British, openly comparing our methods of Government with those of the Turk. There appears to exist too an idea that we may possibly some day attempt to get the country for our selves and there is no doubt that any such attempt would be welcomed, at any rate by the more intelligent and probably by all classes of the settled population within Hasa and Katif.8 Bedouinj. Konreit. Fosition of Turks. With the Bedouin tribes who inhabit the desert round Hasa the case is somewhat different. The subsidised tribes, which are nominally under Turkish control are as follows :— Approximate Approximate Name of tribe. total number i f strength. fighting men. Ajman ... ... 10,000 2,000 Bani Hajir ... 4 to 5,000 800 Manasir 2,000 400 Mura 3 &gt; 000 600 Mutahir 4,000 800 Total fighting strength ... 4,600 The principal Shekhs of these tribes each receive monthly from the authorities at Hofhuf the sum of 15 Rials (about Rs. 30), and keep up constant intercourse with the Turks. By taking advantage of their internal dissensions and playing off one tribe against another, the late Mutassarif is said to have done a great deal towards diminishing raids and rendering the country safer, but even now the Turks have only a very slight hold over them, and outside the settled districts travelling is very insecure. About 15 per cent, of these men are armed with breech-loading rides, mostly Martinis, and the remainder have either antiquated muzzle-loaders or simply their national weapon, the lance. Like all Bedouins they are opposed to any form of settled (Government, and though they are not likely ever to fight for the Turks, they will probably be quite willing to attack an invader for the sake of plunder. Away to the west in Central Arabia, Mahomed Ibn Rasid has his capital at Jabal Shammar, or as it is often called Jabal Rashid. Though his name is in the mouth of every Arab and numerous stories of his power are current (he is said to have a standing body-guard of 1,000 mounted negroes with silver horse- furniture), no definite information could be obtained about him, but he is certainly by far the most formidable man in Arabia at present, and probably the only one who has any authority over the numerous and powerful tribes who visit the great centre of Najd. It is pretty certain that some sort of intercourse is carried on between him and Hofhuf, but doubtful whether his feelings towards the Turks are friendly or the reverse. Koweit is perhaps the best port on the northern part of the Persian Gulf, and has often been proposed as a terminus for a railway from the Mediterranean,' should it ever be constructed. It is ruled by an independent Shekh, who receives a small subsidy from the Turks, in return for which he flies the Turkish flao- 1 here is a considerable export of horses from this port to India. Surrounded on every side, except where they border on the sea, by a desert occupied by wild tribes, who, if not actively hostile, are at least very uncertain and dependent entirely on outside for their food supply, it will be seen how ex tremely isolated is the Turkish position in this part of the Persian Gulf. At present their reliefs are carried by the few gun-boats stationed at Basra, which can together transport about 1,200 men, but in case of war with any power who could spare a rew ships for service in these waters, nothing would be easier than to cut their communication by sea and render the garrisons of Hasa and Katr 7 k l , de P endent ’ bo ^ h for reinforcement and food supply, on the long and 'i Ute , t0 wben envoys, unless well guarded, would always be liable to be plundered by the Bedouin tribes.SECTION III. The Wilayats of Baghdad and Basra. From I he junction of the Tigris and Euphrates at Kurnah down to its Shatt-ui-Arab. mouth, the Shatt-ul-Arab is a broad deep stream, navigable throughout for large steamers. As a rule, however, these only go as far as Basra, the upper portion being navigated by the river steamers which ply between the latter place and Baghdad. The only difficulty in the navigation of the lower part is the bar across the mouth of the river at Fao, where at neap tide there is sometimes only 11 feet of water in the channel, but the bottom is of soft mud, and though steamers occasionally stick there they are usually got off again without much difficulty. Fao is a station of the Indo-European Telegraph Company and the junction F a0 - of the Persian Gulf cable with the Turkish telegraph system. The fort which the Turks commenced to build at Fao has never been finished, no work having been done on it for the last 6 or 7 years; the walls which were built are already falling into disrepair, there are no guns in it, and the garrison consists only of some 30 or 40 men. As I believe a vice-consul has lately been appointed at Fao, information w T ould be sent at once to the Political Resident at Baghdad should the Turks make any further attempt to continue work on the fort. The Turkish fleet at Basra consists of the steel corvette “ Zuhaf,” 643 Basra, tons, armed wdth four 12-centim. Krupp and two Hotchkiss guns, and two Turkish fleet, small armed vessels of 166 tons, each carrying two small guns, two machine guns and one rocket. These vessels usually lie in the river, but they are used for the transport of reliefs or additional troops to Hasa and occasionally take a cruise to the Persian Gulf. They appear to be clean and well kept, and the men are well turned out, far more so than in the Turkish vessels on the coast of Syria. This is due to the present Admiral at Basra, who has the reputation of being a good officer. The present Governor of Basra, Hamdi Pasha, appears to be an exception- Governor, ally good man. Contrary to the custom of most Turkish officials he does not accept bribes. Outwardly, at least, he expresses friendly feelings towards Euro peans, and is on good terms with our Consular authorities. The Gazetteer of Baghdad contains a full description of the town of Basra. From a military point of view its chief interest lies in the fact that, in the event of any operations from India in this part of Turkey, Basra is the port where troops would probably disembark, and whence further operations along the line of the river would be conducted. The low-lying ground on both banks of the stream is liable to be flooded for some way inland during the spring, but a good camping-ground could always be found in the desert on the left bank. Owing to the marshy nature of the country on both its banks, the river forms the only practicable line of communication with the interior, and it is useful to consider what transport would be available in case of necessity. Messrs. Lynch and Company have on the river the following steamers :— River steame Mejidieh Khalifa Used for the regular service between Basra and Baghdad. Blosse-Lynch... In reserve at Basra. Mai Amir ... Plies between Muhammarah and Ahwaz, occasionally visiting Basra. Each of these is capable of carrying at a pinch 1,000 men, or say a regi ment, in addition to 200 tons of cargo. They also have 5 light-draft steel barges, each of which carries 200 tons, and would hold about 400 men ; and one smaller barge to carry 100 tons or 200 men. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Company have two large iron barges, were not built for the river, but could be used if not too heavily laden. theseio River Tigris. Towns. Baghdad. Currency. Political situati n. In addition to the above there are four Turkish steamers which go to Bagh dad, but they are old and in very bad repair, and sometimes take as. much as a fortnight to reach Baghdad from Basra when the river is in high flood. Messrs. Lynch and Company’s steamers, wuthout barges, perform the journey in from three to five days, returning in two days. From Kurnah to Baghdad the Tigris flows through, an absolutely, level country. Its numerous shoals and many windings render it somewhat difficult of navigation, and it is so narrow in parts that there is only just room for the steamer to turn round some of the sharper bends. During the annual spring floods it frequently rises above its banks, and there is then some danger of losing the channel, while the great force of the current makes progress upstream neces sarily somewhat slow. For some distance above Kurnah, extensive marshes, inhabited by semi savage tribes, extend for some way inland on both banks; but higher up, as Baghdad is approached, are vast plains of alluvial soil, now cultivated only close to the river or the few canals which still exist, but which only require irrigation and population to make this one of the most fertile countries in the world and capable of supplying an almost unlimited amount of wheat to the markets of Europe. The only towns of any size on this part of the river are Amara and Kut I’Amara. The former is the larger of the two, and both, owing to the develop ment of the commerce, are rapidly increasing in size and importance. Baghdad is so fully described in the Gazetteer that but little remains to be said about it. The first view of the city, as it is approached by the river, is very pretty, but, as in most oriental towns, a closer acquaintance is disappointing. The streets are narrow and filthy, and, as the houses are all built round court-yards, nothing but dead walls are seen from the roads. A few of the higher Turkish authorities and some of the European residents keep carriages, but driving in the town is at best a difficult and hazardous task ; if the Wali is paying an official visit to the British Resident, he has probably to send and have the streets cleared before his carriage can get along. The bazars are extensive, but not imposing in appearance, and convey a general impression of want of pros perity,, and this is increased by the fact that owing to the mixture of religions, Christian, Jewish and Mahomedan, there is seldom a day on which some sect is not keeping a festival, in consequence of which their shops are closed. In addition to the ordinary Turkish coins the Indian rupee and Persian “ kran ” are both, current in Baghdad. In the spring of 1896 the relative values of the various coins were as follows :— 4 Baghdad or Regie Piastres 20 G. S. Piastres 08 „ 27 Regie Piastres = 6| G. S. Piastres 1 Grand Seignior Piastre. 1 Majidi. 1 Lira or Turkish pound. 1 Rupee. Thus the Majidi was very nearly equivalent to Rs. 3. The relative values of the Turkish coins are constantly changing and vary all over the countrv. Thus at Aleppo the lira was counted at 126 G. S. Piastres, the other coins being correspondingly increased in value, and almost every place of any commercial importance has one.or more small coins peculiar to itself, and which do not pass current.out of the district. In Baghdad too the Majidi, though worth 20 Piastres for buying common articles in the bazar, such as food, etc., was only counted as 19-2 for buying other things such as clothes, and altogether the intricacies of Turkish coinage are such that nothing but. a prolonged residence in the country would enable one to understand them. Baghdad has so far escaped the disturbances which have taken place ir almosi every other part of Asiatic Turkey. At one time there were seriom apprehensions of a rising against the Christians, and it is mainly due to the infim ence of the Commander of the Vlth Army Corps, Mushir Rejeb Pasha, that mdisturbance took place. The Wall at present is Hasan Pasha, a man of much the same type as the ordinary Turkish official. He is not popular among the people, has little influence, and is believed to be not particularly partial to Europeans. Rejeb Pasha, on the other hand, is a strong man. with the repu tation, so rare among Turks, of being incorruptible. He is very popular, both among the troops, whose condition has been much improved during his administration, and among the populace, has married a Christian wife and entertains very friendly feelings towards Christians in general, in fact rumour &lt;*oes so far as to say that he is secretly one himself. When disturbances were feared he went about the city in disguise, and by his prompt punishment of any persons heard talking of attacking Christians succeeded in keeping order. Whatever latent fanaticism there may be among the Mahomedans, it does not, as a rule, appear on the surface, and Europeans can walk about the streets and bazars quite unmolested. Besides the British Resident and Consul-General there are French, Russian Consulates, and German Consuls in Baghdad, and America is represented by a Vice-Consul. Here, as in other parts of Asia Minor, French influence is a good deal felt, nearly all the better class Christians are educated at the schools kept by the various religious orders, and most of them speak French fluently ; it is in fact the one European language which is of any general use in the country. Except perhaps a few Armenian merchants the Russians have no subjects in this part of Turkey, and scarcely sufficient direct interests to account for the presence of a Consul. Their present representative, M. Mashkov, was formerly in Abyssinia, and has the reputation of having done useful work for the Government there. He is well paid, receives a good entertainment allowance, and evidently has a considerable sum of secret service money at his disposal it being commonly reported that he sees all telegrams that pass through the Baghdad office, and like many other Russian Consuls in Turkey he has lately been decorated by the Sultan. His relations with the local authorities appeared, to be more intimate than those of any of the other representatives of foreign powers. Baghdad is the head-quarters of the Vlth Army Corps and contains, nomi- Garrison, nally at least, a garrison of 5 battalions of infantry, .8 squadrons of cavalry and 4 battalions and a mountain battery of artillery, besides other infantry battalions in the immediate neighbourhood. The distribution of the Army Corps, compiled from Turkish official sources, is given in Appendix II, but the actual stations of battalions continually vary according to local requirements and disturbances among the marsh tribes in the lower Euphrates Valley have lately, necessitated the strengthening of the garrisons in that part of the district. It is difficult to account for the difference between the garrisons shown as at Fao and El Hasa and those actually there, ^&gt;ut official returns in Turkey are not to be trusted and it is quite possible that some of the units are so much below their nominal strength that the 30 or 40 men at .Fao represent the whole of the battalion of Fortress artillery returned as serving there. The men of the Vlth Army Corps consist of about two-thirds Arabs and one-third Kurds ; the higher ranks are filled chiefly by Turks, but regimental officers except commandants of battalions, are of the same races as the men. Under Reieb Pasha much has been done to improve their food, equipment, etc., and in these respects they are now well enough off. In Baghdad, they have very aood barracks, built in the time of Midhat Pasha, and a hospital is now in course oi construction there. On the other hand they are always far in arrears with their pay and are frequently called upon to serve longer than the. stipulated time, the'Arabs at any rate do not like serving, and are in a very discontented state. On the whole the men of the Vlth Army Corps do not appear to be such oood fiehting material as those further to the west a large proportion have no f ove (or the Turks and dislike the Government, and so have little inducement to fmht against any outside Power, unless on the ground of rehgtous fanaticism. As elsewhere in Turkey most of the officers are absolutely useless.12 Roads and Rail ways. Rivers. Strategical position. The principal roads from Baghdad are the post-road northwards to Mosul and thence to Diarbekir to the Mediterranean, the road by the Euphrates Valiev to Aleppo and Damascus, which is described below, and the great pilgrim route from Persia through Khanikin and on to Karbala. 1 he question of the construction of railways from Khamkm to Baghdad and from Baghdad to Karbala has often been discussed, though nothing has ever been done, and lately a good deal of interest has been roused by the concession granted to 1 VL Moral, a German subject, for the construction of a cart-road from Tehran through Khanikin to Baghdad, and the right to establish a service of carriages along the road. Beyond the preliminary enquiries no steps have been taken towards the actual carrying out of this project, and nothing will be done before the autumn of this year, when M. Moral expects to return. It is even doubtful whether the syndicate, which he represents, has actually got the capital necessary or whether they have still to raise it. The general opinion appears to be that the success of the undertaking as a commercial speculation is at least doubtful. It would to a very great extent be dependent on pilgrim traffic, and this is always uncertain as, in case of an outbreak of cholera or other disease, the Turkish authorities might at any time refuse to allow pilgrims into the country. The class of which most of the pilgrims are composed have also a great objection to paying tolls or road-dues, if they can possibly avoid it, and the extent to which they would make use of the road would, in a great degree, depend on the amount of security from robbery, official and otherwise, which the concessionaire could obtain. As regards railways it is thought that a Baghdad-Karbala line, entirely de^ pendent on pilgrim traffic, would not pay well, though possibly a line from Khani kin to Baghdad might do so. Another important line of communication, or one that might easily be made so, is the river Tigris above Baghdad to Mosul. The only bar to navigation at present is the presence in the river of ledges of rock or masonry (it is doubt ful whether they are natural or artificial), which extend across the bed in several places, and which steamers can only cross when the river is at its highest. It is estimated that these obstructions could be removed and the river made navigable for the whole distance between Mosul and Baghdad for an expenditure of only £ T. 60,000, but in the present state of affairs there is little likelihood of any thing being done. At present a good deal of merchandise is floated down stream from Mosul on rafts. Strategically the position of Baghdad is somewhat weak ; the town is en tirely undefended, and an army holding it would always be liable to surprise from the direction of Mosul, where the river would form an excellent line of communi cation. In fact Mosul appears to be the strategic key to Mesopotamia and the valley of the Shatt-ul-Arab, and any power holding it would dominate this country. What the provinces of Baghdad and Basra might develop into in the hands of a civilised power, it is difficult to say, but with a proper system of canals and irrigation works which would carry the surplus water over the country and so prevent the disastrous floods which now so frequently occur, nothing but popu lation would be required to render it one of the most fertile districts in the world. If England were that power, the population might be supplied from the over crowded plains of India. Already we have a very large number of subjects who have emigrated to the holy places of the Shiah religion in the country, and this, to Muhammadans at least, would offer an inducement to emigration which no other countries possess.Ill SECTION IV. Baghdad to Alexandretta. Of the two roads which connect Baghdad with the Mediterranean, that Routes, which goes northwards through Mosul and Diarbekir is the most generally used and the best known. This road passes through a fairly populous and fertile region, has caravansarais all along it with a service of post horses, and is the route by which the mails from Baghdad to Aleppo are carried. The other road which is considerably more direct, follows the Euphrates Valley to within two The Euphr^te marches of Aleppo. It passes through a sparsely populated country, with only Valley Road, three small towns along its whole length, and was formerly considered danger ous on account of Bedouin raids. Now there are police outposts at regular intervals along the whole route, and except perhaps for the off-chance of falling in with a “Ghazu” of the Ahnizah or some other tribe, it is as safe as any other road in Asiatic Turkey and, for a Christian at least,_ far more so than those which pass through the disturbed districts of Armenia and Kurdistan, From Der another road branches off to Damascus across the desert, and caravans pass pretty constantly along both routes. Besides its shortness it has the advantage of good grazing in the spring along its whole course, and though supplies in large quantities are not generally obtainable, enough to supply the wants of a small party can usually be found at or near the police outposts. The total distance by this road from Baghdad to Aleppo is about 512 miles, and the iourney occupies generally 24 days, including a halt at Der, on which the 'f nu | e ‘ teers insist. Mules and horses for the journey can be hired at either end, the rates ranging from about 2 to 2^ liras (32 to 40 rupees) each. .During the sprint when the melting snow causes the Euphrates to rise, it frequently ‘T^ts its banks in the low-lying country below Hit, and floods the surrounding fields. At these times there is always a certain amount of difficulty, the flooded parts iravino-to be crossed in boats and causing a good deal of delay, but once Hit is reached the difficulty is over and nothing worse than a short detour to avoid marshes need be feared. The usual crossing is at Fallujah, where there is a bridge of boats, but when in flood the river here widens out to an enormous ex- tent forming innumerable islands, and it is then better to keep to the left bank as far as Hit and cross there. This was the route followed and a detailed account of it is given in Appendix I. From Baghdad to Fallujah the road is across the stoneless, level Baby lonian plain, mostly covered with grass and patches of cultivated land planted by the nomad tribes who roam over it, and whose black tents and numerous flocks and herds are frequently passed. At Fallujah the Euphrates Valley is entered. For the whole distance from here to Maskanah the nature of the country is much the same throughout; the river, dotted with islands, winds through a strip of level country, varying in width from a hundred yards or so to a mile or more on each side, beyond that on both banks is the desert an undulating, stony plain sparsely covered with grass, some two or three hundred feet above the level of the river, and ending sometimes in a steep, rocky cliff, sometimes sloping gently down, but more frequently with a rounded outline and in tersected here and there by stony “ wadys.” As_ far as Anah and for a short distance above it the level strip by the river is cultivated in patches all along by settled or semi-nomad Arabs, there are numerous small villages surrounded by troves of palm trees, and everywhere the aqueducts and water-wheels, which have been mentioned by so many travellers ; in this portion there is little brush wood except on the islands, and fuel is somewhat scarce. From a little above Anah to Maskanah the level strip forms a succession of grassy plains many of them extending for several miles back from the river, while between them the cliffs come in places right down to the water’s edge. There is less settled population and few villages in this part, but the Ahnizah and other nomad tribes graze their flocks and herds on the plains, and in most places there is a belt of brushwood along by the river.Towns. Hit. Anah. Der. H The road keeps partly along the level ground and partly across the stony desert, the latter either to cut off bends or to avoid marshy ground. It is a good caravan road throughout, and with a little trouble field-guns could be got along it. 1 he only difficulty at present is either when the road ascends horn the low ground to the desert, or when crossing some of the stony ravines or ' wadys, ’ which intersect the high ground. Some of these ascents and descents are rocky and narrow, but with a little work field guns could always be got across. Between Der and Aleppo carriages can now go, though the road is everywhere very rough for them and travelling by them must be far from comfortable. The only towns of any size passed through are Hit, Anah and Der. 7/2/contains about 300 houses and is built on a mound raising above the river on the right bank. It is a dirty, uninteresting place, and owes its existence entirely to the bitumen springs in the vicinity, which have been well-known for thousands of years. There are also sulphur springs close outside the town, and the whole place is pervaded with a strong smell of sulphur and boiling bitumen. Its one tall minaret forms a striking landmark for some miles, There is a regular ferry at Hit. Anah is a long straggling town consisting of one street, which extends nearly five miles along the banks of the river, with houses, gardens and date groves on both sides. There is a good deal of cultivation on both banks, and also on the islands in the river, and the place is famous for its ' abbas ” or Arab cloaks, made of a mixture of cotton and wool, and worn by almost all the Bedouin tribes who visit this part. At the north end of the town, on the opposite bank, in the bend below the village of Rawa, is the fort which Midhat Pasha built. It is a fine building, but is now empty, and has been so for years, and the walls have fallen down in places on the face nearest the water. The story told of it is that an old Shekh who lived there, and whose tomb is now pointed out close to the fort, warned Midhat not to build it there. He disregarded the warn ing, but when it came to be occupied 6 or 7 of the garrison went mad every day, and it had to be abandoned, and has never been inhabited since. At the time of my visit there were about 200 regulars in the town, 80 horse and 120 foot. These were said to have come from Baghdad to collect and take back the revenue; the permanent garrison consists only of about 20 Zaptiehs. Der is by far the largest town passed through on the road. It has one fairly broad, straight street, in which is the bazar with numerous “khans ' or caravansarais and the principal public buildings, the remainder of the town consisting of a maze of narrow streets and houses. Der is the head-quarters of the district of Zor and the residence of the Mutassarif, a Pasha who is directly responsible to Constantinople. The troops belong to the Aleppo district, and the garrison consisted at the time of my visit of 500 Nizam infantry, 400 Redif (mobilised there), and about 200 Zaptiehs. The town is said to contain 7,000 inhabitants, mostly Muhammadans and Jews, with about 100 families of Armenian Christians. In the river opposite Der is a fair-sized, well-cultivated island, this is connected with the town by a wooden bridge about 100 yards long and broad enough for carnages. The supports are wooden trestles, 15 to 20 feet apart, and the bridge would carry field guns On the further side of the island is a ferry, and it is here that caravans from Mosul cross. As one goes westwards from Baghdad this is the first place where the Turkish element is noticed but here there is a good sprinkling of Turks, officers of the army and police and other officials Der is the junction of the roads from Aleppo and Damascus to Baghdad, and the desert route from Mosul also strikes the valley here, so that caravans are constantly passing through, and nearly all halt a day in the town. A carriage can usually be hired from Der to Aleppo, but the road is very bad for driving, and the same horses have to go the whole way through. It takes at least seven days and probably more. Seven liras was asked for the journey A single hue of telegraph runs from Der up the valley to Maskanah, with a station opposite the town of Rakkah, and from Maskanah to Aleppo. The question of a railway along the Euphrates Valiev is one that has often been discussed, but nothing but paper schemes have resulted, and it seems im- Railway schemes.12 f(^ *5 probable that anything more will be done. In the present state of development of the country it can hardly be expected that the Turks will spend money on a line of this sort, and, even supposing that England could obtain the concession for a line across Turkish Arabia, its value to her would be purely strategic, and it is generally acknowledged that, depending as it would for its receipts almost entirely on the traffic from the terminal ports, it could never be expected to pay. If lower Mesopotamia and the country between it and the Persian Gulf were in the hands of a civilised power, railways would doubtless be constructed in these parts, and with the development of the country, a line to the Mediterranean would soon become a necessity for commercial as well as strategic reasons, but of this there seems no immediate prospect. But what does seem more surprising is that more has not been done towards Navigation of river improving the navigation of the river, and establishing regular communication by steamers, at any rate along its medial waters. Since Colonel Chesney’s expedi tion in 1835 and that sent by tbe East India Company in 1841, various spasmo dic efforts have been made by the Turkish authorities at Baghdad to run a steamer as far as Maskanah when the river is high, but now even this has been abandoned, and for years no steamer has been seen on the Euphrates. It was the opinion of Colonel Chesney and the officers with him, that by expending a moderate sum of money in removing obstructions and with properly constructed steamers, there would be no difficulty in keeping up regular communication be tween Maskanah and the neighbourhood of Baghdad, the marshes of Babylonia being the part which presents the greatest difficulties. Such a service would be of great value to the Turks in enabling them to keep the Bedouin tribes in check ; there is plenty of fertile land in the valley now lying waste, which with a means of export for the produce would soon be taken up and cultivated, and the valley might then regain a portion at least of the importance which it must once have possessed. t O From Maskanah, where it leaves the river, to Aleppo the road, runs for a M a s k a n a h little over 50 miles across a level plain, well watered and covered with grass in Ale ^P°- spring. Earge nomad tribes graze their sheep and camels there, and raise fair crops of wheat without the aid of irrigation, and as Aleppo is approached numer ous villages are passed through, and the cultivation becomes continuous Aleppo is not a particularly imposing town. Being built entirely of stone, it Aleppo, has a cleaner appearance than most oriental towns, though the open drains, which in many places run down the centre of the streets, are hardly in accord ance with modern ideas of sanitation. The citadel, built on a large artificial mound and surrounded by a deep ditch, overlooks the whole town. It is a place of great antiquity, and the fortress must in former days have been almost impregnable. The town is surrounded by gardens, dotted with olive and pistachio trees. There are representatives of most of the European Powers in Aleppo, and they with the few European inhabitants live in a quarter somewhat apart from the Muham madans, where there are also two very fair hotels kept by Armenians. Aleppo is connected with Alexandretta by a made and metalled road, the Alcxan distance being a little short of 100 miles. This road was only completed some five years ago and was then a good military road, but apparently it has never been touched since and is now in bad repair in many places. Many of the cul verts and small bridges have fallen in and been roughly patched up with wooden planks, often with large holes and hardly fit for field, guns. Stones are told of people starting on the journey with planks in the carriages to enable teem to get across, but when I travelled over that was not necessary. 1 he distances is usually covered in two days in landaus drawn by four horses harnessed abreast, tbe same horses going right through. There are several miserable khans alono- the road, the night being generally spent at Hamam which is rather moie than half-way from Aleppo. Travellers take their own food, and many sleep in the carriage rather than risk being devoured by the hungry insects with which the “ khan ” is infested. There are no beds, but a mattress can be provided to sleep on the floor. Only one stream of any size is crossed, the Atr.in, about 30 _ m ‘ ,es from Aleppo; there was formerly a good stone bridge across it, but half this has been washed away and replaced by a wooden structure, about 40 yards in length. The road is almost level till near Alexandretta, when there is a long.and trying ascent and descent over the mountains by the Beilan Pass, the 1 oad going t irou si6 Political situation. Recent mobilisation. the small town of Beilan, the only place of any sue passed , From Alexandretta steamers go southwards down the coast of byr.a to Alexandria round Asia Mmor to Smyrna and thence to Constantinople. The best lines and those which carry the mails are the Egyptian “ Khedivial' and the French Messager.es Maritiraes.” Thouo-h the northern part of the Aleppo district has for many months been in a very 0 disturbed state, and there is all over the country a very strong feeling against Christians, which the naval demonstration on the coast has served to increase, the inhabitants of the towns of Aleppo and Mexandretta have not so far been molested. In both places there is, however, a strong and not altogether groundless feeling of insecurity. For nearly a year the Native Christian popu- fation of Aleppo hardly dared to come out of their houses, and several times the Europeans collected together for self-defence in the British Consul s house. That no actual violence was used is attributed here, as at Baghdad, to the capability of the officer in command of the troops, and the strong measures adopted by him. This man, Edhem Pasha, appears to be one of the few honest and capable officers at present serving in Asiatic Turkey. During the recent troubles in the neighbourhood of Zeitun, a force of 17 battalions was mobilised at Aleppo to suppress the insurrection. The men seem on the whole to have answered the call fairly well, most of the battalions being made up to a strength of from 600 to 700 men. Each battalion was called up separately, and when collected the men were served out with equipment, arms and ammunition, and marched straight off to the front for fear of disturbances in the town. Arms and ammunition were in sufficient quantities, but equip ment was wanting and many battalions left in a very bad way and in some cases absolutely without shoes. It was only by setting the telegraph wires working that Edhem Pasha was finally able to obtain the necessary stores from other districts. At first the discipline was very bad and the officers absolutely useless,, but Edhem adopted the excellent plan of employing the troops, when not fighting, in making military roads, with the result that the discipline was much improved. Their food is supplied by contractors, but as these are all owed large sums of money by the Government, which they have little prospect of getting, at any rate for some time, the quality is anything but good and the contractors may at any moment refuse to supply more. Needless to say the men receive no pay. Since the capitulation of the Zeitun insurgents and the establishment of some thing like order in this part of the district, nothing has been done towards dis banding the reserves, and it is the presence of these men in the country which constitutes the chief source of danger to Europeans and Native Christians. Since they have been unemployed many of them have deserted, taking their arms with them, and probably often joining the bands of robbers which infest the hilly parts of the country. The remainder are scattered over the country, gen erally in tents. At Maskanah there was one battalion, when I passed through, another at the village of Keri Khan at the eastern foot of the Beilan pass, while two more battalions were on the western side of the hills between Beilan and Alexandretta, and it was stated to be the intention of the'Government to keep altogether eight battalions during the summer in the hills along the coast between Alexandretta and Adana; but whether in order to be at hand in case of internal disturbances, or because they were apprehensive of attack from outside it is impossible to say. Without pay, badly clothed and fed, and quite uncontrolled by their officers, these men are on the verge of mutiny, and as many of them are moreover imbued with a lust for blood, induced by the part they took in the massacres of last year, it will not be surprising if, as is fully expected by the European officials wffio know most about the country, a recurrence of the massacres takes place. Meanwhile the condition of the Armenians in the province is as bad as it can be. Those who revolted at Zeitun and who, owing to the intervention of the European Powers, have obtained terms which must under the circumstances be considered favourable, are absolutely without any means of feeding themselves, and are only kept from starvation by the food and money supplied through the Consuls, and subscribed mainly by the British public. Further to the south, in the neighbourhood of Damascus, the troops mobilised for operations against the Druses also suffered much from want of■7 i3r proper equipment. Many of them were marched up to the hills in winter with out greatcoats or proper warm clothing, and in the early part of the operations a large number died of cold. On the suppression of last year’s so-called rebellion the reserves in this district were sent back to their homes, but owing to recent events they have now probably been again called out. With the treasury at Constantinople empty and the credit of the country exhausted, it is useless to expect from the Turkish authorities any amelioration of the present state of affairs, and unless Europe interferes it seems . likely to end in general anarchy, accompanied probably by almost total extermination of the Christian population. This is probably what Russia desires. To use a favourite expression of the “ Novoe Vremya,” the apple is almost ripe and will soon fall to the ground of itself,” and the Russians hope no doubt to be allowed to pick it up unmolested. Of railway enterprise in Asia Minor I could obtain little definite informa- Railways in Asia tion. With the exception perhaps of the line from Smyrna to Aidin, none of Minor ' them have yielded their shareholders much return, and even on that line the receipts have been falling off. The extension of the Ismid-Angora railway from Eski-Shahr southwards is said to have been completed as far as Afium-Karahisar and work has been commenced at Koniah. There is an idea of connecting it with the Smyrna-Aidin line, but as the branch will have to pass through the mountains and entail a good deal of tunnelling, it is doubtful whether the necessary capital will be forthcoming. At any rate whilst the country is in its present state all enterprise is at a standstill, and no one is likely to invest money in any new undertaking.APPENDIX I. ROUTES IN ASIATIC TURKEY.

Fahami 16 164 5J Road close to river for eight miles, then strikes over desert across the bend in the river to Fahami. No village here, only a small walled post with two | or three Zaptiehs. No supplies and fuel scanty. This, like most of the other Zaptieh posts, is about 100 feet square, with high walls, but no means of firing over them. 8. Anah 184 Road soon leaves the river for the high ground and again comes close to river at 11 miles. From here Anah is visible and the outskirts of the town are reached at 17 miles. Camp three miles further on in a small open space by the river; supplies procurable. The distance between Jabbah and Anah can easily be done in two marches of about 27 miles each. There is a good place to encamp between Hadithah and Fahami. 9. Nahiah 21 205 Half a mile from the camping-ground the long street of Anah is left by the northern gate. After a mile through gardens’ and fields the read ascend? to the high ground and keeps mostly along it, occasionally descending to the river bank At a little under 20 miles a large grassy plain is reached on which the post of Nahiah is situated. No village or supplies of any sort, but good grazing. It is held by two or three Zaptiehs. Country here not so thickly populated as below Anah and very few villages. 10. Al Kayim 24 229 7i For 11 miles road mostly close to the river, then across the desert for eight miles more. The last part is close to the river, chiefly through cultivation. Al Kayim is only a Zaptieh post on rising ground near the old tower from which it takes its name. No village near and no supplies, but it is the residence of a Mudir. The people about are Karablah Arabs who do a little cultivation. 11. Abu Kamal 16 245 The whole of this march is over low-lying ground, marshy in places and with thick brushwood near the river. The road keeps over the grass avoid- „ . , ., , ■ , . , W S t ' le marshes. About half-way between Al- kayim and Abu Kamal the Wilayat of Baghdad is left and that of Aleppo entered. Abu Kamal is a small village on high ground by the river, but with low-lying and rather marshy ground all round it It is the residence of a Kaimakam and has a small bazar. About two miles lower down stones were being collected and it was said that a new post was to be built there for the Kaimakam and Zaptiehs. 12.

About 11 miles from Sabkha there is a steep descent to a large grassy plain across which the road lies. At 18 miles the town of Rakkah is reached on the opposite bank of the river. It is a fair-sized town, with a Kaimakam and small garrison. A branch line of telegraph goes from the main line, with an office in a hut opposite the town. The long stage between Sabkha and Hamam is often broken here. The direct road keeps straight across the plain without going near the town. Many encampments of nomad tribes.

Abu Harerah is a Zaptieh post, with a few tents round if, and a small village of Caucasian settlers. These people are quite fair and live in huts of 'wattle anil daub, with enclosures of hurdle work. They keep bullocks for agricultural purposes and small twq,wheeled carts. 19 Mas ran ah 460 7f Good road throughout, mostly below the high ground, but occasionally rising on to it for a few miles, where it comes close to the river.

The story of Sennacherib then informs us that navigation was known in the Persian gulf at least as early as the eighth century b.c., and it is unlikely that it was ever entirely suspended, as the land routes lay across the deserts of Central Asia, ever the haunt of predatory tribes, which routes are not, even in the twentieth century, opened up to commerce. We next come to the period when Babylon was at her zenith, and trade was so flourishing that peacocks and rice were known even in distant Athens at the time of Sophocles and Aristophanes, and that by their Tamil names.* * * § Under Persian rule Babylon declined, and at her fall direct intercourse with India may have gradually ceased, so that when Nearchos appeared on the scene in 326 B.c., he practically re-dis covered what was already a very ancient trade route. I cannot dwell on his famous voyage from the mouth of the Indus to the Karun, although I shall incidentally refer to it, and as Persia throughout the period of her history never was a sea-faring nation, we come to the times when, in the fifth century after Christ, Chinese ships were Seen in the Euphrates.f This extraordinary commercial activity was eclipsed by the teeming prosperity of the Arabs in the ninth century, when the trade from the East, enriching Balsora ^ and Baghdad, gilded Asia with those imperishable legends that are embodied in the‘Thousand and one Nights,’ and are responsible for Milton’s l ' gorgeous East.” § It was from Balsora that Sinbad set forth on his adventurous voyages which quaintly portray the ideas of the period when the world was but little known, and even to-day the lovely palm-groves and romantic creeks that render Basra an Eastern Venice, retain a glamour of departed glory; while the same high-pooped buggala in which Sinbad and his companions launched forth upon the deep, can be counted by scores in the Shat-el-Arab. When misgovernment began to close the Basra route, the great caravan road via Tabriz to Bandar Abbas took its place. Hormuz, at first situated on the Minab river, and, when the mainland became unsafe, on the island of Jerun, became the emporium of the East, until perhaps one of the greatest events in history occurred—the arrival of European ships in Eastern waters. Although it is impossible to doubt the ultimate benefit that has been derived from the opening of this great trade-route, which perhaps saved Europe from Asiatic domination by a final severance of the two arteries of the world’s commerce via the Persian gulf and the Red sea, yet it is hard not to feel hurt that our representatives first appeared as pirates far surpassing in their methods the general cruelty of the times. In the Persian gulf the behaviour of Albuquerque was atrocious, and it is difficult to read how he mutilated his prisoners “ for the glory of God ” without a deep sense of humiliation. For more than a hundred years the Portuguese, by holding Hormuz, kept their hands on the throat of Eastern trade, while cruising occasionally up the Red sea, until, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the English appear on the scene. The recently published diary of Sir Thomas Roe,|| our first ambas^ sador to India, is, I would venture to suggest, of immense historical value as showing our actual position in those days. A most salient future appears to be the smallness of the trade, the whole of India not being able to furnish more than four or five cargoes a year. It was on this account that a ship, the James, was sent to Jask to try and open up trade with Persia; but even so there were difficulties, not only on account of the Portuguese, but also because Shah Abbas * B.A.S. Journal, “ The Early Commerce of Babylon with India,” by J. Kennedy, April, 1898. f Vide ‘ Rise of the Portuguese Power,’ by Whiteway, p. 1. In the ninth century they only came up the Persian gulf as far as Siraf. J Balsora is the modern Basra. § Cf. ‘ Paradise Lost,’ book ii. || Edited by W. Foster, Esq,, under the auspices of the Hakluyt Society. 1 Cf. ‘ Sir Thomas Roe,’ p. 330: “ That the war with the Turks having blocked commercial intercourse with Europe, there must be in Persia at once a dearth of cloth and a plethora of silk; that it was absolutely necessary to find some vent for the large stock of English goods in their warehouse, for which no immediate sale could be hoped in India.”Greo. Sykes—Second Revise. 3 wanted little else than cash *—although he never refused presents anl in those days, to take bullion out of England was considered to he almost criminal. In 1620 there were two sea-fights off Jask, the first being indecisive ; but in the second the Portuguese were defeated, and the English fac- which appears to have been founded in 1619, was saved from destruction, ffwo years later, in 1622, in alliance with Persia’s great bhah, Hormuz was taken, and the Portuguese power receivt d a blow from which it never recovered. From this date, until to-day, British trade and influence, although with fluctuations, has been on the increase, and our responsibilities have been faced with a determination that has been unsurpassed in any quaiter of the globe. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Jowasmi pirates were strong enough to take H.M.S. Minerva after two da} s’ fighting ! and every sailor was put to the sword. This affront was only wiped’ out by some desperate engagements, which forced the truculent Arabs to abstain from sea-fighting and piracy. Since the middle of the century the pax Britannica has been maintained, although not without a heavy outlay. In the Bahrein group alone has this peace been broken in recent times, when Sheikh Jasim, in 1895, attempted to invade these islands from Zobara on the opposite coast. However, short and sharp was the punishment meted out to him, fortv-four of his ships being destroyed by H.M.S. Sphinx and Pigeon, while an even larger number was towed off to Bahrein. At the present time the Persian gulf is crowded with British ship- ping, Hindustani is the prevalent language at most of the ports, and peace prevails everywhere. It must, however, be remembered that were the Bi'itish gunboats to quit this land-locked sea, piiacy would immediately be re-established; and, as an Arab naively remarked to me, the loot would now be ten times as valuable as it was a generation ago. I reached Bombay in November, 1897, and the beg inning of Decem ber found me at Bushire. A few days after my arrival, news reached Colonel Meade, the resident, of the murder of Mr. Graves, of the Indo- European telegraph Department, while engaged on inspection duty midway between Jask and Chahbar. Being ordered to proceed there without delay, I was soon steaming down the gulf on board H.M.S. .Pigeon, under Commander Mowbray. After calling in at Jask, we steamed east along the coast, and early in the morning found ourselves off Galag, where the Patrick Stewart, with Mr. ffinch, the Director-in chief of Persian Telegraphs, and his staff, also the Persian man-of-war Persepolis, were lying at anchor. After consulting with Mr. ffinch, who had already sent off in every direction to collect camels, we landed, a party of thirt} 7 all told, and camped near a wretched date-grove. Some eight camels were all that could be procured at fiist, so that our kit was restricted to about half the usual scale ; and an earl} 7 hour the next morn ing found us ready to march inland. The sea-shore was quite bare, and inhabited by myriads of small crabs; but once we struck inland the lofty tamarisks gave quite a park-like appearance to the flat level country. After a hot march we reached the banks of the Rapsh, and close to what is technically known as a mast—a miniature Eiffel tower, used when great spans are necessary in telegraph construction—we saw the grave of our murdered countryman. We camped near the Persian force commanded by the Daria Begi, who had sixty men and a gun with him, and then went to hear what my colleague, who had arrived two days previously, thought about the situation. I found that matters were at a deadlock, as the Karwanis ■)■ declined to surrender the murderers, and, the time given them by the Persian admiral expiring on the following evening, we decided that, unless hostages were given, we should march to the Karwan villag* s that were * Cf. ‘Sir Thomas Boe,’ p. 353: “And obserue one thing well: The parts of Persia that vent cloth, which in Steele’s judgement will not exceed 500 a yeare—a small matter—and the rest wilbe expected to be supplyed in mony, are the same that produce the silke and are nearest Turky, as Gordgestan and Gilan ; and to tho^e parts cloth can be brought cheaper by Aleppo then by Jasques.” t Is it not at least possible that we here find the Caraonas of Marco Polo ? The tribe is famous for lawlessness, and is distinct from the Baluchis.4 Geo.—Sykes—Second Revise. said to lie some 10 miles to the north, under the |low range of hills that apparently runs the whole length of Makran. Tents, supplies, and camels were all sent up by the indefatigable director-in-chief, while in the afternoon Mr. Sealy, Director of the Persian Gulf section, came into camp, having, with the aid of officers of the Patrick Stewart, completed a temporary line. They all joined us, and, in the evening, Mr. Wood of the Imperial Bank of Persia came riding up, thus com pleting our party. At 3 a.m. we marched off, but an unwilling gui 'e led us by rather tortuous paths, so that at sunrise we were still far from the hills. At a point where the tracks separated he was so anxious for us to go to the right that we went to the left, and soon saw that our decision was correct, as a large party came out for a palaver. This was merely a feint to gain time, and when we at last reached a large village, we found'it deserted. At night we had three officers for each watch, and between each pair of sentries two natives were told off to listen, as seeing was almost impossible. About 10 p.m. a shot was fired at a sentry, and we heard a murmur as of a large body of men; but Mow bray fired a Verrys red light, and so stopped a rush, if any was in tended. The next day we changed our camp to a better site, and before sunrise on the following day a reconnaissance in force started off west, and we drove the Karwanis from a large date-grove. In the meanwhile the resident had arrived at Rapsh, so I rode in to report, and three days later he reached the Karwan district. Our force being doubled, we had to change our camp, and after a day or two, as there was nothing more to be done for the present, we returned to the coast, where Commander Carr, c.m.g., a Fellow of this Society, gave me a passage to Maskat. After coaling we ran across to Hormuz, and at length my desire of visiting that famous island was to be realized. Producing nothing but salt and oxide of iron, Hormuz is, apart from its fisheries, dependent for its daily bread on the mainland, while there is not a drop of fresh water anywhere. The magnificent fort, that we captured in alliance with fehah Abbas, is still in an almost perfect state of preservation. We entered by a massive door studded with iion spikes and protected in front and flank by bastions. After passing the guardhouse, the lower enceinte, covering about an acre, lay before us, from which a sharp rise led to the inner work, where the most conspicuous object was a superb reservoir; a second incline brought us to all that remained of a sumptuous palace, from which we could see into the ruined town, while numerous rusty cannon, not much bigger than popguns, testified to the fact that these were more guns than could be conveniently canied oft when the fort was abandoned. Descending, we examined what was apparently a breach made by the sea, and seeing that this stronghold was indeed “so well fortified with deep trenches, counter scarp, and great ordinance commanding both city and haven, that none exceeded it through all the Orient,” * we felt proud that our country men had made such a glorious entrance on to the stage of Persia, which the heroic resistance of the Portuguese but served to enhance. The town is entirely in ruins, aud all that we noticed were several hundred reservoirs, while on a little hill on the south side of the bay aie the ruins of what was undoubtedly a chapel. Musing over the utter desolation, it was difficult to believe that such a spot could ever have been a famous city; yet no traveller passed through it but sounded its praises, Abdur Razzak, as the folio-wing extract will show, being not the least enthusiastic: “‘Ormuz,’ which is also called Jerun, is a port situated in the middle of the sea, and which has not its equal on the surface of the globe. The merchants of seven climates all make their way to this port; they bring hither these rare and precious articles which the sun, the moon, and the rains have combined to bring to perfection.” + From Hormuz we tried to make Kishm, but it was too rough, and we were consequently unable to pay our tribute to the great explorer Biffin, who was in charge of a gun at the siege of the castle, which preceded that of Hormuz, and “ received a small shot from * • Some Yeares Travels into Africa and Asia the Great.’ by Sir T. Herbert p 106 t ‘Journey of Abdur Razzak,’ p. 5. Hakluyt Society.vGeo.—Sykes—Second Eevise. ~ the castle into his belly, wherewith he gave three leapes, by report, and died immediately. ’ * Kishm has more recently (in 1896) acquired a melancholy notoiiety as the scene of an earthquake, which killed more than a thousand of its inhabitants and did an immense amount of damage. So long as we were coasting we were in a rough sea, but the moment we reached the land-locked harbour between it and Henjam, we were once again in still water, and easily realized Sir John Malcolm’s high opinion of it. Henjam, although now supporting the scantiest of populations, was once densely inhabited, as the ex tensive rums prove, while fur a few years it was a telegraph station, connecting Eushire with Jask. Upon returning to Maskat, after a most enjoyable tiip, I found the resident just about to start for Chahbar.so I left the hospitable Lapwing and transferred myself to the R.I.M. ss. Lawrence, where I was among old friends. I accompanied Colonel Meade on his farewell visit to the Sultan, where we were received in what struck me as a very European room, until I remembered that it was the Portuguese Government House and factory, the budding being three-storied. His Highness, who knows a liitle Hindustani, appeared to take a great interest in the topics of the day, in which he was evidently versed, and invited me to call whenever I passed through Maskat. The resident came on board the Lawrence, amid the thunder of a salute, and the following morning we reached Chahbar, where half a company of Bombay Marine Infantry, under Captain Creagh, an old schoolfellow, had just arrived, the telegraph station being threatened by Abdi Khan of Dashtiari. I saw him later on at Kerman, the governor- general, at my request, having seized and imprisoned him. A few hours passed and the Patriclc Stewart appeared on the scene, turning all into bustle at the usually quiet station. Being anxious to visit Pasni and Ormara, in the evening I accom panied Mr. fhnch on board the Patrick Stewart, Ttie lamp on the steam- launch attracted large numbeis of fish with a sharp snout, many of which leaped on board, and one of the party was nearly blinded, the fish strik ing him just below the eye. The next morning found us at Gwadur, where we were told that there had been hundreds of tons of fish driven on shore by a storm, which had apparently increased the activity of some gas, supposed to be sulphuretted hydrogen, that has in recent years poisoned the sea. A nairow tiack had been beaten down, but one of our party neglected to use it, and sank almost up to the waist in a veritable fish-bog. Matters were somewhat unsettled, as the Kej rising had affected the neighbouring Kinds, and not only had the telegraph-line been destroyed in both directions, but a raid on Gwadur was quite possible. We sympathized with the postmaster, who said that he expected to find his throat cut every morning, and cheered him up by telling him that troops were on the way to relieve the situation. I was delighted to have the chance of visiting Pasni, the next point at which we touched, as, although perhaps the most filthy and squalid village in my experience, it was just about here that Alexander the Great, after turning the Taloi range, to the noith of which his army had endured all the horrors of thirst, rode on ahead with a few horsemen and dug the shallow wells that saved his exhausted forces. The same evening Ormara was reached after sunset, and upon landing I started off with a guide to find the foice that was on the point of stai ting, under Colonel Mayne, on what proved to be so successful an expedition. Questions were asked as to the state of Pasni, and the chances of the Baluchis making a stand ; and I left with the rather bitter feeling that I had no share in the undertaking. Ormara, like Gwadur, has a hammer-shaped headland, on both sides of which ships can lie; but, unlike that unhealthy port, it is open to the monsoon, and consequently enjoys a good climate. It is the Bagisara of Nearchos f Karachi was reached the following night, but alter enjoying the directors hospitality lor a few days, I once again proceeded up the gulf to Bushire. Upon reporting my arrival, I received instructions from the Lega- * ‘ Purchas Pilgrims,’ vol. ii. lib. x. cap. 9. f Chahbar bay, or probably the Tiz harbour, is Talmena, while Gwadur is Barua.6 Greo.—Sykes—Second Revise. * Cf. Sir Henry Yule’s note on Reobarles, vol. i. pp. 116, 117. tion to join the Peisian governor-general in Baluchistan, so within six hours I engaged additional servants, and with my whole camp found myself once again on hoard the same mail steamer that I had only quitted a few days previously. Upon arriving at Bandar Abbas, my difficulties were manifold, as it was very late in February, and growing hotter and hotter day by day, while, as no one would hire camels to go to Baluchistan, 1 was forced to purchase—no easy task. Besides this, I had to engage a local escort, but failed to secure anything better than a few camel-drivers, while not only was it a very dry year, which meant no grazing, but a famine was raging, and everything had to be carried. Plowever, after live days’ hard work twenty-three camels were loaded up and despatched, and for the first time I was forced to ride “ a ship of the desert,” as there was no chance of any forage for horses on the road. The start was nearly disastrous, as eight Baharlus, members of that most unruly tribe of nomads, held up the caravan, which was some miles behind me, and began to loot it. Fortunately the servants rose to the occasion, and when it was known to whom the property belonged, the Baharlus considerately left it alone. One camel, however, took advantage of the confusion to bolt off, and was only found after a day’s search. From Bandar Abbas there are four, or indeed five, caravan routes running to the interior, that to the west through Sirjan being the most important, as in that district the Yezd and Kerman roads bifur cate. Next in importance is the route that I approximately followed for some stages; it runs via Manujan to Narmashir, and thence to Khorasan via Neh. The central routes are mainly used in summer by Bandar Abbas Kerman caravans, and are of less importance; and yet, year after year, commerce is paralyzed on these trade arteries by a handful of nomads, mainly because the route lies both through the district of Bandar Abbas, and the provinces of Fars and Kerman, and therefore it is difficult to fix the responsibility of the outrages that are ruining both British and Persian trade on to the shoulders of any one governor. To return to our journey, we did not follow the direct caravan route that passes to the north of Minab, but, in the first place, visited that centre, so as to complete our supplies and transport. Minab, or Minau, as it is pronounced, lies on both sides of a river of the same name, and appeals to every traveller from the fact that it was near here, at Harmozia, that Nearchos landed, and proceeded inland to find Alexander the Great in the valley of the Halil Rud. This meeting constitutes one of the most dramatic events that history can claim, and is a fit subject for a painter’s skill. The town is situated on the left bank of the classic Anamis, and is guarded by a picturesque old fort. It has a population of 5000 inhabitanls, and rough woollen plaids con stitute its principal industry. There is also a considerable output of dates, henna, and indigo ; but it is as the resort of Baluchis and Bashakirdis, who barter clarified butter, wool, and hides for calico and copper, that Minab is important, the wild sons of the desert seldom venturing to Bandar Abbas, although the inhabitants of the port flock to the superb date-groves during the summer months. Three Haiderabad Mohammedans, born in the district, and a few Hindus appeared to have all the trade in their hands, and told me that tea and sugar were now occasionally bought by merchants, so that the Baluchis are becoming quite luxurious ! There was great difficulty experienced in obtaining the five more camels that were necessary, but finally, on March 1, after a storm that brought down dozens of palms, some of which fell into our camp, we started with every thing complete, Sultan Sukhru, the plane-tabler, having overtaken me with a last mail. Strangely enough, for two stages we were the first Europeans to traverse what was possibly the route followed by Nearchos, and, when some 5 miles from Minab, we nearly had a similar experience, as we met a peasant hurrying in with information that the road was being held up by a body of Marz robbers, who had already looted a caravan that day. However, nothing happened, and after cross ing the Gardan-l-Pichal, we camped at Birinti, which is situated just above the junction of the Rudkhana Duzdi, or “ River of Theft,” * andGeo.—Sykes—Second Revise. 7 forms part of the district of Rudan, in Fars. We followed up the diminished river to Jagin, the Duzdi river being in reality the main branch, and a third march brought us to Manujan, which is situated near the source of the Minab river, although there is a good deal of drainage from the Mulla Kuh to the west. Manujan has a fine fort now deserted, and should be a very rich district, the camel-grazing being most luxuriant; but, partly at auy rate, from the ignorance of the ruling family, a famine has arisen, and deaths from want were of daily occurrence. The information that I received tended to show that the governor-general was coming in my direction, but when, two stages further east, the Governor of Rudbar came to see me, it appeared that his Excellency had gone on to Fahraj. Curran Khan told me that his ancestors were Arabs of the same tribe as the Kain family* and that three centuries ago they migrated to Rudbar with their slaves, whose descendants still occupy the district. I was now on the western edge of the only large blank left on the map of Persia, although I afterwards found that Khan Bahadur Tusut Sharif, the eminent Indian surveyor, had preceded me, and as the governor-general had received instructions to march down towards the coast, my only chance of meeting his Excellency lay in cutting him off, so I decided to traverse the plain of Bashakird. During my second journey in Persia, I had marched to the north of the great liamun ’ known as the Jaz Morian, in which the Bampur and Halil rivers commingle their waters, and had fixed many of the peaks of Bashakird, while the present journey led in an opposite but almost parallel direction, keeping to the open plain as far as Ramishk, a distance of 118 miles from Manujan. I was unfortunate in suffering from a severe attack of fever, probably a souvenir of Bandar Abbas, and had it not been for my Persian secretary, Nasrulla Khan, and my plane-tabler, much would have been lost from a geographical point oi view. Ihe whole plain, which is very extensive, was covered with the most luxuriant camel-grazing, and in places there were flocks, but the country was so unsettled that we hardly saw a man through out. Indeed, Bashakird, the most backward and savage district of Persia, has never been fully controlled by that power, but during the last few years a miserable revenue of £160 per annum has been nominally paid, Durran Khan, who holds the title of governor, practi cally making a raid into the country and seizing what he can. It is divided into four districts, each of which is assessed for a quarter of the revenue, and they are thus presumably equal in population _ Starting from the west, Sindark is the nearest division to Minab. Eastwards lies Jakdan and then Anguhran, while Marz occupies the whole of the north, and it is from this division that raiders attack the caravans. Four or five days before my arrival, seven camel-loads of sugar had been seized and an Afghan shot one stage to the east of Manujan, blood still staining the spot when we passed. Unfortunately for the raiders, one load of sugar was the property of a British subject, and six months later I asked the governor-general for compensation. In reply, he said that he did not know whom to mulct, so I was able to tell him that the Kalantur of Ramishk had sold sugar to my party far cheaper than it could be bought at Bandar Abbas ! To resume the thread of my narrative, after nine marches, all of which, except the last, lay across the most level of plains, with foul well water to drink, we reached Ramishk, the exact situation of which had puzzh d me for many years. It lies at the junction of two branches o! a small river on the outer range of the Bqshakird mountains, and consists of perhaps a hundred huts and half a dozen small shojis, Ramishk being the capital of eastern Bashakird. The Kalantar was not friendly, and as it was rumoured that our troops and those of Persia at Karwan had been driven into the sea, our position was somewhat delicate, until the welcome news came that four hundred camelry were on the way from Fahraj, which proved to me that the governor-general had received my letter, enclosing instructions from the Prime Minister of Persia, and had acted without delay. The very heavy rain that had kept us drenched for a week ceased at the l.e. of the Khuzai.Geo.—Sykes—Second Revise. ® end of March, and the heat became very trying, so that, as every thing was being done to capture the murderers of Mr. Graves, I decided not to wait for the arrival of these troops, but to push on to Fanoch, feeling sure that I should get letters on the way. We were now in a hilly district, and, following up the Ramishk river to its source, I was surprised to pass villages and date groves in what I thought was a desert. Crossing the watershed, we camped near a spring, and the following day, after fording a small river flowing north to Isfand, we reached the important village of Kutaich, in the Fanoch district, where I was visited by the governor’s sons, whom I had known for five years. At this point it may not he out of place to summarize briefly the state of Persian Baluchistan since the assassination of H.I.M. Nasir-u- Din in May, 1896. The Baluchis had generally believed that there was no new shah, and the continued absence of a Persian force had, more or less, contributed to foster this delusion. From fear of His Highness the jFarman Farma, no rebellion had broken out until that strong ruler had left Kerman, but in the following year Sirdar Husein Khan headed a confederacy of Baluchis, who besieged Fahraj. The siege, or, more strictly speaking, the blockade, was not eventful, the only incident being an abortive attempt to mine, which was defeated by a sortie, and after three or four months the Baluchis retired, upon news reaching them that a Persian force was on its way to relieve the garrison. Since that date, Sirdar Husein Khan and his brother Chakar Khan, Govern' r of Fanoch, had kept quiet, the former generally living in or near a natural foi tress, termed the Kuh-i-Mihan, some 30 miles to the south of Kutaich. As both the brothers knew me, they sent to say that they hoped 1 would intercede for them with the Persian Government, so I replied that if they had seized and handed over Mr. Graves’s murderers, I should have been ready to dp so. Already, two months previously, Seiid Khan, son of Sirdar Husein Khan, had promised to do this ; but Baluchis rarely carry out their promises, so I felt that it was useless to rely on them, and continued my journey, feeling glad that they had been prevented from arming themselves with Martinis, as, were this the case, Persia would have had the greatest difficplty in holding Raluchistan, and even as it is, Sirdar Husein Khan is much at large. Two stages, during which large villages were passed, brought us into the valley of the Fanoch river, and at last I received letters from the Asaf-u-Dola to the effect that he had acted immediately upon hear ing from me, but could npt come south in person, being ill; but would I not visit him at Fahraj ? However, I was so weak that I had to be hoisted on to my camel, while the daily temperature was over 100°, and as everything that could be done was aheady in train, I decided to make for Chahbar as quickly as I could. At Fanoch our arrival at first created a panic, but in a few hours the villagers re turned, and supplies could be procured, but only at famine rates—by way of indemnity, it is to be presumed. I was once again on familiar ground, and felt grateful that I had been able to march through Basha- kird, which I had gazed across with longing eyes from the summit of the hill above Fanoch some five years previously, while I had on this occasion the great advantage of working partly from fixed points. We were told on reliable authority that a party of Karwanis were lying in wait for us ; but apparently their hearts failed them, or we were successful ip avoiding them, and, after marching down the Fanoch pass, we crossed to the Sirha river, and were soon out of their reach Daily it grew hotter, while our camels, although fed on dates, gave in one by one, in spite of the fact that our loads were very light, all supplies being finished; so it was with much relief that we struck the British telegraph line at Parag, where we halted for a few hours until the creek became passable. At dawn we passed through the gap of Tiz, a great port in Seljuk times,* and a few hours later, with a single * Afzal-al-Din Ahmad bin Hamid, known as Afzal Kermani, who wrote in a.h. 584 P188), gives the following description of Tiz: “ There is also the gap of Tiz that belongs to Kerman. Much merchandise from the tenths paid as customs and from the harbour dues reaches the royal treasury. Inhabitants of Hind, Sind, Abyssinia, Zanzibar, Egypt, from the land of the Arabs, from Oman, and from Bahrein trade there. Every description of musk, ambergris, indigo, Brazil wood, and also aromatic9 ^ eo -—Sykes—Second Revise, worn-out camel left out of seven that had started in the night, I looked down upon the substantial telegraph station at Chahbar, where I was soon welcomed by Messrs. Wilson and Keelan with the hearty kind ness so universal throughout Persia and Baluchistan. A day or two later came the welcome news that the Karwanis, taken in front and rear, had given up their chief, Shai Mohamed, the murderer, and that his accomplice Malik Jind had been shot; so that my mission was finally crowned with success. In due course of time orders came for me to proceed to Shiraz, and special arrangements were made for a British India steamer to pick me up. After spending a few days at Bushire, we started for Shiraz in very hot weather, the hours we spent at Daliki, at the foot of the famous Kotals, b ing especially unpleasant. Travelling up country, and by moonlight, is perhaps the best way to see this wild m=ize of moun tains, and I never remember anything so grimly savage and frowning as the apparently sheer ladders up which British go ids are painfully carried. Five ymars previously I had travelled in the opposite direction as fast as possible to catch a steamer, but on the present occasion a day was spent at Shapur, where the rock sculptures were inspected, although, owing to weakness, I was unable to visit the cave containing the statue of the great king. At Kazerun we camped in a garden of oranges, known as the Bagh-i-Nazzar, with a superb avenue, the trees in which are said to be four hundred years old, and are perhaps 40 feet in height. A particularly small lime of excellent flavour is also grown, the garden, indeed, producing several varieties bch of oranges and limes. Shiraz, where I stayed for three months, is a city of contrasts. Sir Thomas Herbert evidently left his heart behind when he was forced to proceed on his journey, and certainly the people seem to enjoy life with a zest quite unknown elsewhere in Persia. The gardens at Masjid-i-Bardi which disappointed Lord Ourzon would, 1 feel sure, have won his praise in the summer; nevertheless, the climate does not suit Europeans, and consequently Shiraz has a bad name, although the heat is not excessive. With the aid of my host and future fellow-traveller, Mr. Wood, a piece of ground was rented and polo s organized, to the joy of the Sbirazis. Even the donkey-boys caught the infection and started the game. Time quickly passed, and after a few days at the Kuh- i-Bamu, where I enjoyed the resident’s hospitality in a valley at an eleyation of 6700 feet, I left Shiraz with regret, although until I did so my health was not restored. Two days were spent at Persepolis, and we dined by moonlight where— “ Those black granite * pillars, once high-reared By Jamshid in Persepolis, to bear His house, now, ’mid their broken flights of steps, Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain-side.” f The following morning a visit was paid to the Sassanian sculptures, the chief figure in which is quaintly described by Josafa Barbaro as “ a great ymage on horsbacke, seemyng to be of a boysterouse man, who they saie was Sampson, about the which arr many other ymages apparailed of the frenche faoon, with longe heares.” f During the summer I had been engaged in collecting Persian references to the ancieut game of Gu-i-chogan, which, under the guise of polo, I have been instrumental in re-introducing to its ancient home. Among other pieces of poetry and prose was one from the Shah Nama, in which Zal, praising Mthrab of Kabul as a warrior, says— “ In figure, none approach him, No one is his peer with the gu.” § roots of Hind are offered for sale; also slaves of Hini, Abyssinia, and Zanzibar. It is a mart for fine velvets, shawls, sashes, and such-like articles of value. Close to Tiz is Makran, the mine of sugar candy and sugar, which is exporte 1 to all countries of the heathen and of Islam.” The Arab travellers, however, speak of Tiz as a small port, and Afzal Kermani is certainly prone to exaggeration. * They are, in reality, limestone. f Shelley’s f ‘Alastor.” t 1 Travels of Venetians in Persia,’ p. 81. Hakluyt Society. § These lines appeared to me not to refer to polo, but to a weapon, and it has struck me that the pear-shaped pendant that swings at the royal charger’s quarters in these superb rock pictures may have been what is known as a morning star. Against the usual theory that it was a tassel, I would urge that such ornaments are not fastened by chains, that there only appears to be one, and that it is not in every panel, as it would probably be if belonging to the horse-gear. Again, it would not serve its10 Geo.—Sykes—Second Revise. Continuing our journey, we rode up the banks of the Polvar, which Yarthema A at the beginning of the sixteenth century mistook for the Euphrates, and after spending a few hours at Pasargardse, we ascended to Dehbid, from which place Barbaro branched off to Yezd. At this, the most elevated stati n in Persia, I enjoyed the hospitality of Mr. Jefferies, and was . iven an account of the siege sustained at the time of the Shah’s ' atb, which would have ended badly for our plucky fellow-countrynu'i and their heroic wives had not the nomads omitted to cut the telegraph-line. The main postal road through Peisia is certainly much more interesting than any other, while supplies can always be obtained, so that, although the sun had by no means lost its power, we much enjoyed the various stages. Abade, famous for its sherbet spoons, is a really pretty village; while Yezdi- khast, shaped like a steamer, and perched on an inaccessible cliff, 18 certainly one of man’s strangest habitations. On the confines of Isfahan, I was met by the Adjutant-bashi of H.R.H. the Zib-i-Sultan, and under his guidance we entered the ancient capital of Persia. Isfahan has been so fully described that I will but mention that, in my opinion, it is by far the most interesting city in Persia, while those who are admitted to an interview with its royal governor can scarcely fail to be struck by his bonhomie and urbanity. The last week in September saw me bound for Nain, where I over took Mr. Wood, whom I was fortunate enough to have as a companion to Sistan, my destination. At Nain we struck a route that I had travelled in 1894, but I was able to add to my knowledge, as I was told that the fort was known as the Kala-i-Gtabr, and even the Eanats had Parsi names. At Agda, a village of Seiids, the inhabitants claim to be kinsmen of the Parsis, recently converted from the ancient religion. This receives most interesting corroboration from Josafa Baibaro, who, when travelling from Yezd to Kashan, wrote as follows : “Twoo daies jorney further (sc. from Maibut) is a towne called Guerde, in the which there dwell certein men called Abraini, which in myne opinion either be descjnded of Abraham orells haue Abraham’s faith, and they weare long heare.”f There is little doubt in my mind that these Abraini—the word being probably a corruption of Gabr were Zoroastrians, who, to mark their conversion to Mohammedanism, were given the honorary title of Sejid, just as to-day the title of Mirza is generally given. In the neighbouring hills is situated a shrine in honour of the Banu, or Queen of Pars. This lady was the mother of Yezdigird, and was swallowed up by the earth when pursued by the Arabs. It is an interesting fact to note that, until quite recently, cows were sacrificed at this sanctuary, but the killing was done by Mohammedans, who also ate the flesh.J Ardakan, t o, was formerly a great Parsi centre, and the writings of the Dasturs of Turkabad are still preserved at Bombay. Apparently they all became Mohammedans some sixty years ago, and now Sharifabad is the only Parsi village in the district. Altogether, this part of Persia preserves many traces of the Zoroastrian worship, while dari, the old tongue, stated to be a corruption of darbari, or the official language,§ is used, not only by the Parsis, but also by the villagers and townspeople, as far as Kashan. ^ At Hujetabad, one stage from Yezd, Mr. Ferguson, of the Imperial Lank of Persia, rode out to spend the night, and on the following morning we entered Yezd, where we received a warm welcome from the European colony. Continuing our journey, the section to Kerman was also familiar country' to me, but, as I wished to show my companion purpose, and, as it was certainly uncomfortable for the horse, it was, in my opinion, either a ball o( iron thrown at an adversary, the chain bringing it back, or else it was' swung round the head. All Persians to whom I have referred the question accept this version, and many of them term it topuz, which is the ordinary word for mace. While on this subject, it is interesting to note that the word chogan is still with us in the shape of “ chicane.” * Vide ‘ Ludovico di Yarthema,’ p. 101. Hakluyt Society. f Travels of Venetians in Persia,’ p. 82. Hakluyt Society. t The legend runs that the Banu was thirsty, and a peasant offered to milk his cow for her, but that, when the operation was completed, the cow kicked over the pail, so that the traveller had to continue her flight without quenching her thirst. The sacrifice was apparently an act of retribution. § It may also be derived from dar, a gate. Of. the Sublime Porte.Geo -—Sykes—Second Eevise. 11 what I considered to be the best line for the Central Persia Telegraph to follow, this was unavoidable. Upon reaching Kerman, we found the Rev. A. R. and Mrs. Blackett, of the Church Missionary Society, ready to greet us, and the three weeks that weie spent at my headquarters were fully occupied with accumulations of consular work and the large amount of visiting that is so necessary m the East. About the middle of November, however, everything was leady, and we marched to Mahun, where, as usual, a day was spent in getting the loads arranged. Ihe caravan route that we had followed before in 1894, and again m 1896, leads across the high and somewhat narrow Hanaka pass, which would be particularly unsuitable for a telegraph line; but as for many years I had thought that the line must finally run this way, I had partly explored a route that appeared to be much more suitable, and, although information regarding it was vague, we found that it was open throughout, and perfectly adapted for a telegiaph line. The first stage was Zain-ul-abad, and some 10 miles beyond it an almost imperceptible watershed was reached at an elevation of 8400 feet, with a distance of more than 5 miles between the hills, so that the chief difficulty appre hended was successfully surmounted. In Tahrud, which is the name of a district, and not of a village, we again struck a known track, and alter descending the valley for three stages we reached Bam, were we halted for two days, as there were many calls to receive and return, while our complement of running camels, which are almost a necessity for tire desert, had to be made irp. B tm, with a population of 13,000 inhabitants, is a most prosperous town, being, as it is, the great henna centre, while with its new bazaars it presents a very different appearance to what it did at the time of the Sistan Mission : its altitude is 3400 feet. We marched somewhat leisurely across harmashir, enjoying to the full the greenery and the excellent shooting, and halted at Rigan for a day to engage extra camels lor the desert that lay before us. My companion was to proceed to Ladis, and for this reason, in addi tion to the fact that I hoped to meet Captain AVebb Whre on the frontier, we decided to march to Kwash, as I knew that there was a fairly easy route running across the desert. A Persianized Baluchi chief and six of Lis followers were engaged as guides, and after camping at Deh Yaghi Khan, on the eastern edge of the Narmashir oasis, we filled up our water-barrels and entered the desert. The first stage was waterless and destitute of forage for the camels, but the following day we found very fair water at Chah-i- Rais. Throughout these desolate marches it was evident that we were in a volcanic region, which the name Dahana-i-Bulbulak, or Volcano gorge, corroborates, while at Chah-i-Rais we were only some 40 miles to the north-west of the Kuh-i-Bazman, the extinct volcano that I had climbed in 1894. We crossed the northern prolongation of this mighty range and camped at Sim Sor, on the bank of a salt river which, taking its source close to our camp, flows approximately west-north-west to the Shurgaz Hamun. The river was full of reeds and 30 yards wide, flowing in a sluggish stream between high banks, and as sweet wafer was procurable some 15 miles distant, we decided to halt a day and try for a wild ass. However, our camels had frightened off that most timid quarry, and although wo saw two we could not get near them, as they were thoroughly alarmed. The next stage brought us to the foot of the black range that, running approximately from north to south, holds up the Sarhad plateau, and after a very long day we crossed this mountain barrier and tasted almost sweet water at Jauri. At Kwash, three stages further east, my second journey was again struck; but as supplies for our large party could not be procured, we moved around the east slope of the great Taftan range, halting at Sangun before making an attempt to scale the volcano from that side. Taking only light tents, we marched to the base of the mountain, and, after an easy climb, camped at 8500 feet in thick scrub and near a spring of water. Above us rose the great double peak, from the side of which white vapour was curling, while on the crest a second and larger column of vapour was visible. The climbing on the following morning was at first particularly easy, there beiug a steady ascent12 Geo.—Sykes—Second Revise. through luxuriant bush. At an elevation of 10,000 feet we passed a natural amphitheatre, perhaps 150 yards square, and at 11,000 feet we rested below a frozen waterfall, the water of which formed one huge icicle. There was thenceforward a strong smell of sulphur, and the ascent was very steep, while I was nearly annihilated by an incautious servant, who started an avalanche. At 12,000 feet we found seven orifices, from which white vapour was ejected with a noise resembling that of a locomotive just starting. Five of these apertures were very small, but two were larger, and the stones all round were covered with a coating of sal-ammoniac and sulphur. The ground was very hot, and not only burnt our boots, but burst the bulb of my ther mometer. When perhaps 30 feet from the summit, our advance was barred by a cliff, so that we had the mortification of failing at the last moment, although I had a Ire ad ■ scaled Kuh-i-Taftan just five years previously, both ascents having taken place towards the end of Decem ber. After resting, and making a collection of specimens, we some what wearily descended to camp, the smell of the sulphur having given us bad headaches, and the next morning we returned to San gun, which I shall always remember as possessing a solitary cypress of gigantic dimensions, its perimeter, 6 feet above the ground, being 24 feet 11 inches. The supply question being urgent, we had no time for delay, but, skirting the range, descended into the basin of the Ladis river, and on the second day after leaving San gun we reached Bangan, a mile or two above the deserted Ladis fort. We had hoped for supplies, and were much disappointed at learning that all grain was imported from Sistan, and was hardly to be got at any price, so that Ladis * as an important centre is a myth. However, we spent a “Merrie Christmas,” two sorts of partridge, snipe, teal, and woodcock figuring on the menu, while our animals enjoyed a well-earned'rest, the riding-camels being much exhausted from the lack of good grazing. My companion temporarily quitted me, and travelled due west to the Galugan plain, and the Rud-i-Mahi, while I proceeded north-east, and in three stages struck the trade route to Racha Kuh. I now propose to make a few remarks on this, the western frontier of our great Indian Empire. As one result of the Durand mission to the court of the Amir in 1893, the Afghan-Baluch boundary was delimitated by Captain McMahon, a difficult piece of work occupying two years. Coinciding with the second year of this delimitation, in 1896, the Perso-Baluch Boundary Commission, as it was inaccurately f termed, under Sir T. Holdich, a Vice-President of this Society, whose assistant I had the honour to be, fixed the boundary between Persian and British Baluchistan, so that the Government of India became re sponsible for a large slice of desert that had hitherto been the resort of desperate raiders who had driven away all peaceful inhabitants, Owing to the award of the Sistan Mission, a triangular strip of desert lies across the most direct Quetta-Sistan route, while Afghanis tan, being a sealed country, bars all access to the Helmand, and as from Sistan to bTushki, a distance of more than 500 miles, there is not a single village or hamlet, few districts offered less promise. However, the action of the Government of India in remitting all tolls and customs, and in finally buying up the rights of the Khan of Kalat, whoso representatives were not progressive, gave the needed impulse; while Captain Webb Ware has not only dug wells and built huts at every stage, but is placing bqnnias at the more imp&lt; rtant posts along the route, who are bound to keep and sell supplies at a moderate rate, A weekly postal service, which has since become bi-weekly, has also been instituted, so that, as far as Webb Ware was concerned, every thing was being done to attract trade to British territory, while my mission was, partly at any rate, to report and make recommendations as to the best means of assisting and protecting commerce in the wild regions of Eastern Persia, * It consists of seven hamlets, which cluster round deserted forts : (1) Dizak, (2) Barziar, (3) Bangan, (-1) Ladis, (5) Alinjan, (6) Mirkub, (7) Andeh. Total, 118 families at the time of our visit, but in good years there might be 250 tents or more. t The Persian commissioner more accurately termed it the Perso-Kalat Com. mission.Geo.—Sykes—Second Revise. ’ 13 To return to our journey, Webb Ware had sent me three letters to various points of the frontier, and from them I learned that he could not reach Robat Kala until the middle of January, and that a small escort was on its way to join me, I consequently halted until the escort came in, when we continued the journey in cold weather, registering a reading of 24° at 8 a.m. on New Year’s Ray, 1899. The road wound up and down an interminable maze of defiles, but these have since been avoided, a better route having been selected, and on January 2 we reached Robat Kala, which looks like a border tower, framed in a background of frowning mountains. Unfortunately the camel-grazing is indifferent, although the water is good enough ; moreover, the surrounding country is a mass of black hills and watercourses, so that I am afraid that time will elapse before population springs up .round this our most westerly outpost. A few miles to the north we passed the somewhat insignificant black hill of Kuh-i-Malik-Bia, where the Indian and Persian Empires actually touch Afghanistan, and at Hurmak my companion rejoined me, after having travelled north via Duzdap. When we resumed our march we entered the flat stoneless plain of Sistan, which seemed quite as strange to us as dry land feels after a long voyage. Some 30 miles from the British frontier we crossed the Shela, a deep watercourse 350 yards wide, with high cliffs. In modern times it merely carries off any superfluous water from the great lake, or hamun, which overflows once in seven years on an average. As, moreover, the Zirra,* the hamun to the east, is quite 100 miles long, it is evident that at some probably remote period all the waters of the, llelmand drained into it. Unless this were the case, the great width of the river-bed, its 40-foot cliffs, and the huge area covered by the Zirra, could hardly be accounted for. At the time of our cross ing there were a few large pools of green water in the Shela, which has erroneously been termed Shelacj, the word being Arabic for a body of water.f The fourth stage from Robat Kala lay through a part of Sistan that had formerly been fed by a canal from the Helmand, taken at a point now in Afghan territory. It teems with memories of Rustam, the great hero, two mounds, at least a mile apart, being pointed out as the manger and heel-ropes of Raksh, his “ lightning ” charger, while Hauzdar was the scene of the execution of Earamurz. It now consists of a walled town in a good state of preservation, deserted about a hundred years ago, when the Sarbandi tribe seized it by treachery and ousted the Rais tribe, which is said to represent all that is left of the famous Ghaz who defeated and captured Sultan Sanjar. I have been much struck by the resemblance between Sarhad and Palestine on the one hand, and Sistan and Egypt on the other. When we traversed Sarhad, the districts that I had seen in 1893, dotted with nomad tents, were now deserted, and a Sarhaddi, who much resembles the Kafirs described by Sir George Robertson, was rarely to be met. Upon making inquiries, the invariable reply was that they had gone to Sistan in consequence of the drought, as there alone could their families and flocks be kept alive. Upon entering Sistan, which is, it must be remembered, fed by a river that tails as rarely as the Nile, and is in consequence the granary of the surrounding tribes, I was struck by the vivid parallel between these Sarhaddi chiefs who left their highland home and crossed the desert to Sistan, and Sheikh Ibrahim and Sheikh Yakub who, thousands of years ago, quitted theirs in Palestine to find sustenance in Egypt. As I have said above, Sistan depends on the Helmand, but hardly with the relation that exists between Egypt and the Nile, as not only does the Helmand, or Hirmand, as the Persians term it, pass through Sistan, but that district receives the entire discharge of its waters. Accordingly, I propose to give a summary of the various routes taken by the Helmand in historical times, as without some con sideration of this question much in Sistan remains obscure. To begin our survey with the fourteenth century, there was a great dam known * A couiraction from the ancient Zarangia, or Persian Sistan, while Sakaslani was the district to the east. A friend suggests that in the word “ Sakse,” we have perhaps a clue to the origin of “ Saxon,” a word which is so puzzling, t Of. The Mashela that separates Bushire from the mainland.■14 Geo.—Sykes—Second Revise. as the Band-i-Akwa * (evidently a corruption of Afghan, or Agwan), whence a canal or canals were drawn, fertilizing the district now covered with ruins, through which we passed to the south of Sistan. The main stream ran north, and was known as the Rul i-Nasru, Shahristan and Zahidan being cities on its bank. These conditions were changed when Timur found himself unable to capture Zahidan, and his son Shah Rukh destroyed the dam, which is said to have been built of stone and cement. As a result, the Hauzdar district to the south gradually went out of cultivation, and the Helmand, while still keeping to the Rud-i-Nasru, created a channel for its superfluous waters, which en circled the three hills of Sehkuha, hitherto not inhabited, ihe rivei approximately followed this course until early in the nineteenth cen tury, when the whole volume of water carved out a new channel to the west of Nad-i-Ali. As this left the always cultivated Sistan high and dry, the Rud-i-Sistan was cut a little to the north of Sehkuha, a task of great magnitude, which was more than once abandoned before being finally accomplished. This was the state of affairs until recently, when the Helmand began to forsake the Nad-i-Ali channel, breaking across Mian Kangi in various places, and in 1896 a regular channel, known as the Rud-i-Perian was formed, destroying Jahanabad, Ibrahimabad, and Jalalabad. A glance at the sketches will show that this new course is not far from the ancient Rud-i-Nasru, to which it is expected the wayward river will finally return, although perhaps with a smaller stream, the volume of water decreasing decade by decade. To resume, seldom was any party more glad than we when we reached Varmal, the southernmost village of Sistan, as the supplies for which we had sent on ahead had missed us, and we had neither flour nor forage left, so that to be once again in a land of plenty was very pleasant. We were about a mile from the hamun, and, strolling across the treeless expanse to its edge, saw the surface of the water covered with wild-fowl of every conceivable species: when they rose, there was a roar like surf beating on a rock-bound coast. We marched to Nasratabad,| the capital, where the governor rode out to meet us; but after four days we returned to Varmal,Swhere we met Captain Webb Ware and also Mr. Tate, both Fellows of this Society. As may be imagined, the two days that we spent together were all too short, as both Webb Ware and Wood had to return southwards, while Tate and myself proceeded to the Kuh-i-Khoja. From Varmal a ride of 18 miles brought us opposite what* in the British Empire, would certainly be termed “Table mountain, 'do reach it we had to traverse the hamun, which was perhaps 2 miles across, and at most 4 feet deep. There were scarcely any reeds in this portion, and what there were afforded no cover, nor was there any game ex cept thousands of coots, known as chur. We waded into the shallow water and climbed on to tutins, or rafts composed of bundles of reeds, resembling a bisected cigar, and were slowly punted across the shallow lagoon. At oun landing-place were the ruins of Kakkr, consisting o! numerous buildings, round and square, while, winding up a cliff, a ruined road brought us to the summit at Kuk, the fort protecting Kakkr. The Kuh-i-Khoja, originally known as Rustam’s hill, rises some 400 feet above the level plain, and as it is the only object that breaks the even monotony is, not unnaturally, famous in legend and history. In the former category, it may be mentioned that the capture of Kakkr and the slaying of Kuk, its king, was Rustam’s first exploit; while in modern times, it resisted all efforts at capture by the forces of Nadir Shah for a period of seven years, when peace was made. The hill in shape resembles an apple, and is higher at the edges than in the centre. It has evidently been mined, as there are great pits, some 40 feet deep, while thousands of tombs, consisting of mud domes, hollow cairns or pillars, occupy a large portion of the summit, the graves being all above ground. The Khoja, or holy man, who gave his name to this hill in super- session to that of Rustam, was termed Ghaltun, and there is a small shrine in his honour. There is also a building termed Ziarat Gandum * Vide sketch. t The name Nasirabad is not used nowadays.15 Geo.—Sykes—Second Revise. Piran, which is visited at the vernal equinox, when wheat is burnt and thrown over the shrine to ensure a good harvest. At this season there are .also races, together with putting the stone, and it seems probable that these customs date from pre-Mohammedan times. At the south west corner we found a patch of yellow sandstone, covered with stones resembling peas congealed together, of which specimens were taken. Tate left me the following morning, after far too short a visit, as for six months I was not destined to meet another fellow-country man. As soon as I received the necessary values, I began the sys tematic survey of Sistan. My plan was to move the camp some 5 miles twice a week, so that every portion of the district could be examined without difficulty. I started with the southern section, visiting Sehkuha, which in some maps is shown as the principal town * in • Sistan, whereas nowadays it is comparatively insignificant, although the picturesque old fort contains a garrison of fifty soldiers. We crossed the Rud-i-Sistan some 5 miles below the dam, the horses swimming and the camels just being able to touch the bottom, and the following day we visited the Helmand. At the dam it is perhaps 400 yards wide, flowing fairly fast between low sandy banks, and was a most refreshing sight, rivers being scarce in Persia. The dam is a fragile lattice work of tamarisk stakes, with small fascines fixed in between. Its strength, in a sense, lies in its weakness, as the river flows through it, although quite enough is diverted to fill the Eud-i- Sistan, while the low banks and friable soil would not support a masonry »dam, which the river would probably avoid. As soon as the river rises it breaks, and when the floods subside Sistan has to depend on wells for its water-supply until the band be repaired. Another object of interest was Shahristan, a huge old mud fort. It lies on the left bank of the Rud-i-Nasru. Lower down was Zahidan, which was evidently a place of great strength. Legend has it that it was at the siege of this city that Timur was wounded by a tamarisk arrow, and so gained his soubriquet of Lang, or lame.f I have seen it stated by previous travellers that the ruins of Zahidan extend for 14 miles, but the fact is that there were villages lining the Rud-i-Nasru throughout its length, and these have been mistaken for suburbs of the capital of Sistan. To the north of Zahidan, the fort of which enclosed an area 600 yards square, with a keep of 180 yards, is a pillar constructed of kiln-burnt bricks, known as Mil-i-Kusanak. It is now some 60 feet in height, with a base circumference of 55 feet, and has two belts of Kufic inscription, both of which, to my eyes, seemed to be the Mohammedan, confession of faith. There is a spiral staircase, and the eolumn is said to have been a belonging to the mosque of Arvakin, the ruins of which town are close by. The members of the Sistan Mission mention a similar tower at Damgban. Towards the end of February we returned to Nasratabad, which is a permanent camp surrounded by a high wall, with one corner fortified. Just outside is Huseinabad, a village of some three thousand inhabitants, which is generally regarded as “ the city,” Nasratabad being mainly inhabited by the garrison, who ply various trades in the bazaars. It is interesting to know that these villages occupy part of the site of the ancient Zirra. Sistan is governed by the family of the late Mir Alum Khan, Amir of Kain, and although it has been in their hands for thirty years, not the slightest effort has been made to improve what is naturally one of the richest districts in Persia, which is in as backward condition as Baluchistan. As an instance of this, I may mention that no vegetables, not even onions or potatoes, are grown, while there are very few gardens, as the headmen of the villages enjoy but a yearly tenure, and con- sequently have no interest in improvements. As may be supposed, the villages, which are built on refuse heaps and yearly rise an inch or two, have no good houses, and even the governor’s house compared un favourably with those inhabited by small landowners in other parts of * As a matter of fact, there are no towns, and less than a dozen large villages, in the district. f In a.h. 764 (1362) Timur entered Sistan as a fugitive, at the head of a thousand horse. He took many villages, but, being wounded in his hand and foot, retreated to Makran. It is therefore improbable that he besieged Zahidan on this occasion.16 Oeo.—Sykes—Second Revise, Persia. The climate, according to universal testimony, has much im proved of late years, and must have been somewhat try mg before as we had a temperature of 92° during March, while m early Apn ■ flies by day and the mosquitoes by night rendered existence unpleasant to man and beast alike. r As the weather was growing hot, while not more than two-thirds o Sistan had been travelled over, early in March we commenced our second tour, stiiking the edge of the lake at a point due nortb^of Nasratabad. We were now able to examine a different sectio ho,mun, as for many miles the shallow brackish water was covered with high bulrushes, rising to a uniform height of 10 feet a o\e our ( , Engaging rafts, we were poled down an open passage about the width of a cairiage drive, and heard the notes of countless birds while hawks of every species hovered above. The first bird that we bagged was blue, with a red beak and rather long legs; it is termed a bM, and is good eating. After that ducks of various sorts rose, offer n ideal shots, but difficult to pick up in the thick jungle. My poler told me that there were four hundred families of fowlers, or Saiads as they were termed. They pay half a crown per family as a tax, together with 3 lbs. of feathers, the collection of which is a great industry m Sistan. Nets held apart by stakes are set, and as the birds feed across them a concealed fowler pulls a string and takes the bird. 1 ne Saiads appeal ed to be a class quite apart, and it is possible that they are the original inhabitants of Sistan, as when Timur swept the pro vince clean they could have concealed themselves m the hamun, where pursuit would be impossible. Further east, at Gazbar, which is the best centre for shooting, we saw large flocks of geese, many of which we bagged by the simple plan of firing a volley among them from a distance of some 400 yards, o^e volley resulting in a bag of three geese. . , At Jalalabad we were on the bank of the Rud-i-Perian, and as the flood had commenced, the crossing to Mian Kangi * was anxious work The river which is divided into several branches, was flowing wuti a swift current, and was nearly 4 feet deep, the main stream being a quarter of a mile wide. We engaged several men to support the loads on each side, and, to our great relief, only one camel fell which was almost marvellous. Mian Kangi is of quite a different character from the rest of Sistan, being covered by a dense tamarisk jungle, in which the villages are mere clearings. We rode to the Tapa-i-filial the frontier where the Helmand, until quite recently, discharged its waters, and found a bare waterless desert, covered with the roots of perishing reeds, and affording yet another example of what water means in these dried-up lands. We marched south with the greatest difficulty, as tne numerous canals were hardly practicable, the guides being up to t eir chests in water. At Takht-i-Pul, and again at Karkusha, are old rums, with splendid kiln-burnt bricks, 24 inches by 17 inches m size; but no coins or seals were forthcoming,'although boih sites were said to have been Keiani cities. , tt i i We saw Nad-i-Ali, the Afghan frontier post, across the Helmand. It is built on a conspicuous mound; its ancient name was apparently Nokoij and it was only repeopled and renamed some sixty years ago or less. Close by, to the south, are the ruins of Amiran, or Miran, where Greek and other coies and seals are found after heavy rain. At Milak the Rud-i-Perian flows in a single channel 300 yards wide and for perhaps 50 yards swift and deep. Rafts were procured, on which our gear—to use the comprehensive naval term—was stowed, and the horses swam across, but not without difficulty. Each camel had four gourds tied on to its back, and a swimmer towed the “ ship of the desert ” in front, while a second man sat on its tail, presumably to prevent a capsize. The oont, as Thomas Atkins terms it, was thus towed across, not making, as far as could be seen, the slightest effort to swin, but passively submitting, with an air of dignified melancholy. Early in April the whole of Sistan had been surveyed, and prepara tions were made for the move to the province of Kain. As there were * Said to be the equivalent of Mesopotamia, t Vide ‘ Eastern Persia,’ p. 299.17 Geo.—Sykes—Second Revise. several stages in front of ns where forage could not be procured, while both flour and barley are imported from Sistan, it was decided to take a two months’ supply with us, which necessitated hiring a hundred camels in all. The next question of importance was whether the hamun would be covered by the steadily advancing flood, or whether we should be just in time. By good fortune we found that, although the direct road was closed, yet by making a slight detour we could avoid the water. After a short stage to Afzalabad, situated on the eastern shore of the lake, we started off some two hours before sunrise, and when it grew light we could see the Kuh-i-Khoja to our south, while off the road, on the western shore of the hamun, was the Mil-i- Nadiri, or Pillar of Nadir, a mud tower that was perhaps used as a signalling-po.-t by that great soldier. At Beiring * we camped on the west edge of the lake, and our horses, although covered up, were so nearly driven mad by the grey flies until the famous hot wind began to blow, that we revelled in the thought that we were leaving Sistan just in time. Thirty-three miles of desert with a solitary tank, empty for nine months in the year, lay between us and the village of Bandan, which guards the entrance to the hills. We were told—and I quite believe it that the loss of life on this stage was very great during the summer. At Bandan there is a palm-grove—there are no palms in Sistan and the heat is said to be terrible, as the low hills both radiate the sun and shut off the wind. From this village we rose steadily to the desert stage of Gisha, and another march brought us across the range dividing the hot and cold countries, while on the seventh day after leaving Nasratabad we reached Duiu, and were once again free from the heat and fly torment. The district of Kain entered at Bandan consists mainly of a back bone of hills running from north to south. On the west lies the Lut, on the east the Dasht-i-Naumid, or “Desert of Despair,” while to the south the ranges sink down to the Sistan basin or again to the blight ing waste of the Lut. There are no perennial rivers in the district, the drainage flowing to the low levels of the desert, but in this connec tion I would mention that great river-beds attest the fact that at no remote period the volume of water was much larger, M. Khanikoff having traced the bed of the Birjand river for hundreds of miles across the Lut. As a corroboration of this fact, I visited perhaps twenty hill forts in the province, all of which had tanks, but none of these held a drop of water. At the same time the rainfall is greater than that of Kerman, the population depending to a large extent on deimi, or crops that are not artificially watered. Kain has been traversed, mostly by the same routes, by more than one traveller, but we were the. first party to explore it syste matically, and, what is equally important, to survey it, as all the work previously done consisted of prismatic compass or plane-table sketches rapidly made while travelling along a main road. On our arrival we dismissed most of our camels, and thenceforward the camp was moved by relays, which not only economized money, but gave time for the survey to be carried out, as in Eastern Persia it would not be advisable to leave the surveyor far from support. We climbed the Kala Kuh behind Duru, and on its summit found the ruins of a fort built of stone and excellent cement, with several tanks. The village chief, whose ancestors came from Bokhara, told me that the fort was the work of Hoshang, of the Peshdadian dynasty, which is impro bable. From its crest we had a splendid view across the “ Desert of Despair, which forms so good a Perso-Afghan boundary, while, looking to the south, we could trace our route for many a mile. At Huseinabad, where the Birjand and Tabas f roads bifurcate, the smell of the assafoetida plant in flower which covered the plain was almost overpowering, and we were glad to move on to Tabas, the chief village of the district of Sunnikhana, lying in a well-watered plain, and, as the name implies, inhabited by Sunnis. The fortress, although much dilapidated was said to be very ancient, and was formerly known as * This is a local word for a mound according to Dr. Bellew. f The district must not be confounded with the Tabas that lies about halfway between Ye/.(l and Meshed,G-eo.—Sykes—Second Eevise. Kala-i'Mazinan. Tradition has it that Mazinan was a general of Alexander the Great. From this rich plain we proceeded to Birjand, as I wished to be settled down before the month of Moharram; so, leaving the main camp behind, we marched due west to Fork, which, lying at the entrance to the Mainabad range, possesses a most romanticdooking stronghold situated about 500 feet above the valley on an isolated spur. The following day we passed through the important village of Dar Mian, a corruption of Darra Mian, or “ in the middle of the valley,” and steadily rose, passing numerous hamlets, until, at rather over 7000 feet, we reached the watershed of this range of rolling hills, which are quite unlike anything I had hitherto seen in Persia, and are uniform in character right up to Kain. For miles we passed through tulips and hyacinths, while, as the gardens were one mass of bloom and the climate delightful, we certainly saw the district at its best. Descending the western slope of the range, we looked across the valley to the high Bakaran hills, under which many villages were nestling, and on May Day we halted at Bujd, a Sunni village, the following morning entering Birjand, when the Amir’s brother rode out to welcome us. The town is situated on both sides of a wide bed, and covers a curious range of small rounded hills running down the centre of the valley. Its appearance is unpleasing, owing to the absence of the trees and gardens that grace almost every village in Persia, while its single kanat is salt, and all drinking-water is drawn from abambars that are tilled by bringing down streams from the hills. Lying in a sterile valley, Birjand draws most of its supplies from Sunnikhana, and owes its population of 15,000 inhabitants to the fact that it is a distributing centre for Western Afghanistan, as well as the seat of government. The climate is cold and bleak in winter and hot in summer, but close at hand are numerous hamlets in the Bakaran range where it is always agreeably cool. The Bagh-i-Zirishk, which, as its name implies, is full of barberry bushes, was placed at my disposal, and three days after my arrival, I received the visit of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, Amir of Kain, who is almost the last of the semi-independent chiefs of Persia. Of Arab descent, and aged about forty-seven, my visitor gave me the impression of a much older man, and his accounts of the days when Turkoman, Afghan, and Baluch raids were in full swing made me marvel that there was any population whatever left to harry, although no doubt return forays prevented the evil from being overpowering. As may be supposed, the Amir is rather behind the times, and he expressed surprise at the opening of the Suez canal, while the idea of wireless telegraphy quite upset him. He told me that he was a member of the Khuzal or Khuzaima tribe which had originally come from Bahrein, and that in the family circle they still spoke a patois of Arabic, which was also to be heard in the Birjand bazar. As the elder brother of the Amir rules both Sistan, Tabas, and Tun, the southern portion of Eastern Persia is entirely in the hands of this family, which is however disunited, as is so often the case in the East, the two Amirs being half-brothers. May’and the beginning of June were spent at Birjand, during which period we gained an insight into the very patriarchal form of government, and also visited the surrounding country. As the weather grew hot—-SI 0 being registered at 8 p.m. one night—we made inquiries about hill stations, and finally fixed upon Duruksh, 40 miles to the east-north-east, as it was said to be cool, and, besides lying in the centre of an unexplored district, was also conveniently situated for my consular work. In addition to this, it is the home of the Kain carpet-weaving industry, and is fairly close to Tabas, so that the cost of forage would not be excessive. Our first stage was Kahnish, situated 15 miles to the east of Birjand on a nala draining into its river, and the following day we crossed the northern continuation of the Mainabad range by an easy pass, known as the Gudar-i-Sar-i- Chah, from a large village of that name situated in a valley sloping down to the Fakh Hud, which, draining a somewhat large district, and passing through Tabas, discharges its flood-waters into the Dasht-i- Naumid. I mention the fact as even the latest maps are most inaccurate on this head. ,Geo.—Sykes—Second Rtvise. 19 Descending past hamlet after hamlet, we rode through an encamp, ment of nomad Arabs, and finally reached Gask, where the Khan Bahadur was awaiting me, after having joined up the survey to the work that had been done further south; in the morning, leaving him to connect Gask with Tabas, we swung north, and, crossing the _Fakh Rud, entered the hills among which Duruksh lies. After marching for a few miles we saw a narrow valley full of ripen ing crops, on the east side of which lay Asiaban,* * * § a large village of two hundred houses; and two miles further up was the village of Duruksh, where we found our camp pitched in a small garden. At first, we were not at all attracted to this hill station, as the noon temperature was 90°, and this at an altitude of 7090 feet; but in a few days a north-east wind sprang up and made the climate cool enough. Duruksh, the head of a considerable district, consisting of fifty-one villages and hamlets, contains two hundred and twenty houses, the name being explained as a corruption of Darra Raksb, or the “ Valley ot Raksh.” j' Above it, for two miles, the narrow valley is filled with gardens, in which the peasants appeared to spend most of their time during the summer months. The village boasts of a mosque, said to have been built by the Uzbegs,| but it is as the centre of the carpet trade that it acquires importance. In the district there are 450 looms at work, about a quarter of which, including all the best, are at Duruksh. Sad to say, aniline dyes are generally used, although the difference in cost is not appreciable; so that, instead of the lovely colours that formerly distinguished a Kain carpet, the eye is offended by glaring scarlets and greens. However, a few of the best master- weavers still cling to the vegetable dyes, and a reaction, which I did my best to foster, is slowly setting in. The patterns are conventional flowers, and occasionally masks, and the quality is not as fine as that of the exquisite products of the Kerman looms. The great bulk of the carpets are bought in Meshed and sent to Vienna, so I was informed, where their cheapness, I presume, secures a market. Towards the end of June I was gladdened by the appearance of Lieut. Wyatt of the Royal Garrison Artillery, who, with a hospital assistant, had travelled through the heat from Quetta, having covered the distance of some 800 miles in thirty-eight days—a record that is not likely to be broken. Early in August the exploration of the district round Duruksh was completed, so we moved our camp to the north, crossing an elevated plateau to Shahkin, which was formerly the chief village of the district. Shahkin has a population of rather less than a thousand, and is situated at exactly the same elevation as Duruksh; but the next stage lay steadily down a wide valley, crowded with villages and fields of beetroot, and at Khushk we felt a considerable difference in the tempe rature. A third long march, during which we quitted the wide valley draining into the Shur Rud and skirted the picturesque Kuh-i- Warizk, brought us to the wide plain on which Kain is situated. Approaching it from the south, a mass of gardens are passed, and the city is seen with a conspicuous mosque—-the Masjid-i-Jama, a very ugly erection—rising above dilapidated walls. It is in a wretched state, and has a population of some 6000 inhabitants, a considerable percentage of whom are Seiids. Its staple product is saffron, with which it supplies almost the whole of Persia. Lying in a fertile district, opposite passes in a rugged range, Kain is undoubtedly a site of great antiquity; indeed, it is said to be the Artacoana § mentioned by Arrian as the city at which the princes of Herat took refuge from Alexander when he pursued them. The identification seems possible, and, even to-day, Herat-va-Kain almost sounds the same as Artacoana or Artacoan. If this identification be accepted, then the World s Conqueror travelled by Shahkin and Duruksh * Lit. a miller. f Kaksh was Rustam’s great war-horse, as mentioned above.

Personally, I am of opinion that Sistan was not visited by Alexander. A glance at the map will show that, owing to the great bend of the Helmand—the importance of which does not appear to have been studied in connection with many problems—Sistan lay very much out of the way; so that I would suggest that from Tabas, Para * * * § was made for, and that the Helmand was struck at or near Girishk, where I would locate the Euergetse. lo return to Kain, on the range to the south-east of the town we examined the ruins of an important fort, occupying the summit of two hills that rise some 500 feet above the valley. The main entrance is on the south-east side, and, passing a massive guard tower, the hist line of bastioned walls is entered: thence there is a slight rise up a track skirting a tank that is partly hewn out of the rock and partly faced with stone. A second guard-house was then passed through, giving admittance to the second line of defence, there being a steady ascent throughout. Tins is filled with remains of what were evidently barracks; and a further rise of 30 feet leads to the keep, round which is a third line of bastioned walls built of unhewn stones like the others and set in mortar, and also faced with the same material, luis reduit is said to have been an ancient Parsi stronghold, while the lower portions were the work of Kerim-ibn-Jamshid, who also built the mosque: the date on the latter is a.h. 796 (1393). I had intended to make Kain my most northerly point, but, to my amazement, I found that the range enclosing the northern side of the valley was pierced by a gorge which carried all the drainage of Nim- buluk into the Rud-i-Shnr, whereas it is shown as a solid barrier in the map. It was therefore decided, after Wyatt had left me for Ker man, to explore Nimbuluk f and to carry up the survey to the range dividing Kain from Gunabad, which had the advantage of enabling me to connect my work with that of my first journey, when I had passed through the latter district on the way to Tan and Kerman. We crossed the range by the pass used by the Sistan mission, and, after filling in the western section of Nimbuluk, halted for some days at the important village of Dasht-i-Piaz which is situated opposite the two passes that cross the range to Gunabad.| Both it and Khidri, 2 miles to the south, are mainly inhabited by Arabs. We then returned to Kain by the direct road, passing through the Dahana-i-Karkab, which carries the entire drainage of Nimbuluk into the plain, where it unites with the “ Salt river.” It was now September, and so the heat was less trying; we therefore set to work to complete the survey of the hills lying between us and Birjand, having, as the open plain with very few villages lay to the west, practically surveyed everything of importance. At Sehdeh, halfway between Kain and Birjand, we found ourselves in a centre inhabited by the followers of Agha Khan,§ who number a thousand families in the province. Their chief is a young man, called Morad Mirza, but the sect appears to be rather on the decrease. By the end of the month we had reached the area of work done from Duruksh, and so returned to Birjand, where camels had to be engaged, my instructions being to return to Sistan and thence to Kerman. I was naturally anxious to fill in the country to the west of the route I had followed when marching up from Sistan in the spring; but, this being out of the question, I finally decided to march south-west to the pre-Mohammedan mines of Kala Zarri, on the edge of the Lut, as, by traversing all the valleys, I should be able to find out which was the main caravan route to Meshed, a point hitherto not clearly known, while I could also visit the important town of Neh. After retracing our steps to Bujd, we continued to march parallel to the Bakaran range as far as Mud, near which village we concluded the survey at * Cf. note *, p. 24. f Literally Hall-district. Cf. Nimruz. x The most westerly pass is known as Darakht-i-Benna, or “ wild pistachio tree; ” then comes Sulimani, which is easier and more direct. To the east there is the Gudar-i-Abbasabad, leading to Khaf. § Agha Khan is well known as the descendant of the “ Old Man of the Mountains.’, Cf. Yule’s ‘Marco Polo,’ Cordier’s 1 Ordoricus,’ etc.Oeo.— Sykes—Second Revise. 21 4 miles to the inch, and started work at 8 miles to the inch, to suit the quicker rate of marching. Quitting the direct road to Sistan and Neh, we marched south-west towards the hills, passing some delightful garden villages, and finally crossed the Bakaran range by an easy pass, at an altitude of 7300 feet. Hearing of a wonderful cave that was off the road, we determined to explore it.; so, after a cold night spent at an elevation of some 7000 feet, we started off to find Chinishk. Leaving the main valley at Rask, we bore almost north, up and down rough torrent beds and along the edge of steep precipices, until, crossing a pass, we saw Chinishk lying on the opposite hillside. We entered the little town, with a popula tion of, perhaps, four thousand inhabitants, built among huge boulders, and finally emerged above it at a spot where there was a gigantic chinar, the “ arbre sec ” of the Middle Ages, so often mentioned in poems, such as the ‘ Roman du comte de Poitiers,’ * which runs— “ Se PAmiraus ne rent Noiron Mon onele, qu’il tient en prison, Jk n’i remanra tor de marbre Que n’abaee jusc’au Seeh-Arbre.” The cave lay in the limestone crags above, and after reaching its ontrance we doffed boots and hats, and descended by some slippery stones for about 20 or 30 feet: we then reached a lateral passage, which was almost blocked by a rough box containing human bones. Crawling past this, the crux came in the shape of a very small hole, which, personally, I negotiated with difficulty. Beyond it the cave opened out, and we came to a tank, the presence of which clearly indicated that the cave was once inhabited. There was then a series of descents, with skeletons in a perfect state of preservation at each corner, and the gallery was said to run for miles; but our curiosity was exhausted, and we were glad to reach the open air once again, the atmosphere having been most oppressive. The tiny deformed man who was the guardian of what he termed “ the shrine,” told us that the skeletons were the mortal remains of a band of pilgrims, who, hearing that the Imam Reza had been poisoned, renounced the joys of this world and took up their abode as hermits in the bowels of the earth; their home struck me as being partly natural and partly arti ficial. Turning our backs on a most interesting corner of unexplored Persia, we descended the stony valley on to the open plain, and late in the day reached Mukhtaran, which lies on the Neh-Khusp road, and is a great centre for camel-breeding. Continuing our march, the next range of hills that we crossed was much lower, the climate growing proportionately warmer, and at the hamlet of Sibcha we found that we had struck the main caravan route which, running from Neh to Khusp, crosses into Nimbuluk by the Khabisi pass, after which it reaches Dasht-i-Piaz and Gunabad. As there are four parallel routes, I inquired why this one was preferred, and was informed that the climate was milder and the grazing better, while the hill country was avoided as far as Nibuluk. A still lower range with a scarcely perceptible watershed lay before us, and, crossing it, we marched to Basiran, which, with an elevation of 4800 feet, is situated on the edge of the Lut. From here we rode in a south-westerly direction, through a series of low black ranges that are of exactly the same character as the hills on the north of the desert when entered from Tun, and at 11 miles we reached Kala Zarri, or “Golden Fort,” also known as the Kala Gabr,f or “ Par sis Fort.” This small square structure, built in the same manner as that at Kain, with an exterior measurement of 60 feet, and with walls 20 feet in height, was evidently designed to guard the spring of water, round which were clustered the smelting-works. Nowadays a little smelting is carried on with the most delightfully primitive appliances, copper being extracted mainly from slag: the annual output is said to be 6000 lbs., but this must be discounted. Two * P. 54, vers. 1283-6. t Gabr originally meant “a man,” whence Gabriel, the man of God : of. Latin vir, and Welsh gwr. It now signifies “ an infidel,” and is the Giaour of the Crusaders. In Persia it is especially used to designate a Parsi (cf. Guebre), and in Baluchistan a Gaur is a Hindu.22 Geo.— Sykes—Second Eevise. miles to the south, on the skirt of the last range that shuts off the flat immense Lut, the mines are dug, either in the form of deep cuttings or of shafts connected by galleries: one of the shafts measured 70 feet in depth, but we could not visit them. On the other hand, we found the cuttings easy of access, and knocked off specimens of the various ores. I was much impressed by the dimensions of these mines, that must have been worked for hundreds of years, considering the rude appliances of the day, and bitter was my regret that I could find out nothing about the miners, who were evidently non- Mohammedan, none of the Arab travellers mentioning Kala Zarri. Continuing our journey with the conspicuous conical peak of Shah Kuh to the south, which must be a magnificent landmark for caravans traversing the heart of the desert from Khabis, we recrossed a range, and marched down into the valley, where, at the junction of nine roads, the important town of Neh * is situated. A glance at most maps will show that no routes whatever are shown running south from this centre, and yet this is Persia’s great eastern artery of commerce, the caravans from Bandar Abbas passing to the west of Rigan, and pro ceeding from the desert stage of Gurg to Neh either direct or, if in need of supplies, by the somewhat hilly route via Nasratabad. Upon approaching the small town, which has a population of five thousand inhabitants, the first object to catch the eye is the fort, apparently an exact counterpart of the one at Tabas, and next the attention is arrested by seeing fifty windmills in a row. These in genious contrivances consist of two walls built parallel in a north-easterly direction, the prevailing wind blowing from that quarter; they are almost closed on this side, and are wide open in rear. Sails of rush- work are moved by the wind, and in their turn cause the upper mill stone, which is fastened to a pole, to rotate. A few of these windmills may be seen in Sistan, and, in fact, all over Eastern Persia, which may perhaps be the home of the windmills. At any rate, they are mentioned by Masudi and Ibn Haukal as having been seen in Sistan in the tenth century of our era, when they were unknown in Europe. Three miles to the east is a hill fort termed Kala-i-Shah-Duzd.t This was evidently ancient Neh, and was immensely strong, the only accessible ravine running up the steep hill being guarded by sangars and a bastioned wall, similar to that of Kain. The gateway consisted of a square keep with the narrow entrance underneath, while the side of the hill, rising 600 feet above the plain, was covered with the remains of thousands of houses, and I felt that I had seen nothing on so large a scale in East Persia, the houses being crowded over a space of three or four acres. As ever, the tanks were empty. Neh is also said to possess highly mineralized hills, but our chief recollection of these latter is that from their crest some of Tate’s points were clearly visible, so that, after being six months out of sight of them, we had the great pleasure of checking our work and finding it accurate. From Neh to Bandan we found the heat distinctly trying, although we were at the end of October. At Aliabad, the second stage, there was a direct desert road to Sistan, from which an immense quantity of wheat is exported, although Neh grows quite enough for its own con sumption, but it has to supply all the through caravans. We finally reached Sistan, which we found as dry as we had left it waterlogged, so that we were able to follow the direct route, known as Surkh Gazi, halting at Nasrabad, which was the camping-ground of Nadir Shah, upon his arrival in Sistan. Here it may not be out of place to state briefly what measures have been taken for the protection and encouragement of British trade in Eastern Persia. It was a necessity for me to keep in touch both with India and Tehran, but as the Persian post only runs a weekly service as far as Birjand, the Government of India commissioned me to * Cf. 'EurevBzv ’Avavcoi’ x^P a T V S ’Aptlas, ev f irii\is /xeyiffT-q 4'pa /cal Bis irdXts /cal N/vj tt/jAis (Isidores of Charax, 16). f The legend runs that Shah Duzd, who is apparently connected with the Kuk or Kok of Kuh-i-Khoja, forced Zal to pay him tribute, until Eustam reached manhood, when he challenged the oppressor. A wrestling match was agreed upon, and as neither of them gained any advantage after several rounds, a truce was made to allow the thirsty heroes to quench their thirst. Eustam drank sparingly, and so easily vanquished his rival, who drank his fill, and thus sealed his own doom.23 Geo.— Sj kes—Second Revise. organize a service which bridged over the gap between the British frontier and Birjand. To keep this service efficient and to make it of use, two Indian hospital assistants, who are eminently personse gratae in Persia, were stationed at Birjand and in Sistan, where Major Benn of the Indian Political Department now occupies a fine consulate, efficiently protecting British interests, without which trade would have languished. A letter now reaches Birjand from India in less than a month, and Mi. shed in five weeks,* whereas by Persian post via Tehran and Bushire, two months is nothing extraordinary. It remains for the tea-planters to take advantage of a route by which the sea is avoided, which they are beginning to do, and, as the indigo used in Persia is grown in Sind, both of these staple exports should profit by the new route, while in a lesser degree there will be a demand for many sorts of British goods.f , When it is considered that Sistan has a population of less than a hundred thousand, all at a low le\el of civilization, it is obvious that the local trade will be small, and yet the district tapped is extensive, and a gradual development is certain, not only in Eastern Persia, but in the Garmsil of Afghanistan and in both British and Persian Baluchistan. As to the through trade with Central Asia via Meshed, the Government of India has aided merchants by the remission of all customs and dues, and by granting a rebate on the terribly expensive Quetta railway for all goods intended for export. To resume, between Sistan and Narmashir there lies a corner of the Lut, about 200 miles in width, conveniently bisected by the village of Nasratabad. Retracing our steps to Yarmal and Hauzdar, we struck south-west across the Palang Kuh, reaching the hills at 21 miles from the stage of Chah Bashkaran. However, there was no water until, after ascending a wide nala for a considerable distance, and accomplishing a march of 37 miles, we found our camp pitched near the bitter spring of Turshab. The advance camels having taken twenty hours over the march, a halt was imperative, alter which we rose across the .high range and descended on to the plain of Garagha—the Kilagh Ab of the Sistan mission—where there is very rich grazing and a hanat of fair water. Were there security, a village would speedily spring up once again. This plain is famous as having been Rustam’s lavourite hunting-ground, and it was here that Bahman, the Darius Longimanus of the Greeks, when sent on an embassy, tried to murder the hero by starting an avalanche. This, however, failed, Rustam diverting the stones with his foot, as recounted in the “Shah Nama.” The next stage to Nasratabad lay across the Malusan range, where there are the shafts of disused copper-mines known as Chehel Kura, or “ Forty Furnaces,” and also a shrine termed Subz-i-Pushan. Nasra tabad is the name of a fort built by the Yakil-ul-Mulk, Governor- General of Kerman, shortly before the passage of the Sistan mission, on the site of Isfe, which is still called Ispi or Sipi by the Baluchis. It is a veritable oasis in the desert, and capable of great development but as the garrison is irregularly paid, the fort is at the mercy of the surrounding Baluchis, who render the road unsafe. Its population consists of an entirely nominal force of forty camelry and some thirty families of cultivators. There are, also, some Baluch nomads dotted about the valley. Barring access to the south, a high range runs across the road for perhaps 30 or 40 miles, with only one pass. In my opinion, this con formation of the mountains proves that it was the route by which Krateros joined Alexander the Great after his arrival in Kerman, travelling down the Helmand to Sistan, and thence making for Fahraj in Narmashir, which has been—erroneously, I would maintain—identi fied with the Pura of Arrian. From Narmashir there is a low easy pass, the Dahana-i-Abbas Ali, leading to Rudbar, where Nearchos also rejoined his master, as mentioned above.J Continuing our journey, we had to march in one body, as there was * This rate has since been improved upon. t A Quetta firm has cleared Rs.10,000 in the year 1899-1900, which for a pioneer venture is excellent.

I will quote a passage from the printed manu script of a history of the Seljuks of Kerman, which throws some light on this. Referring to Malik Kaward, who was put to death in a.h. 466 (1073), it runs as follows :—■ “ On the Sistan road, in the valley of Kaward, at four farsakhs from Isfe, a darland, i.e. a door closing the road, was erected. The door was of iron, and a guard was posted there.” It is thus clear that Nadir Shah has usurped the credit of the great Seljuk prince. The pass known as the Gudar-i-Surkhwak is crossed a mile above, the track being only wide enough for single file, so that Krateros’ elephants must have experienced difficulties, although there is just room for them. The descent was rather steep, but we enjoyed the view across the yellow Lut, while in the far distance we could see the well-known Kuh-i-Bazman. We camped during the heat of the day at Robat, a ruined caravanserai situated at the exit from the hills, where there is no water, and reached Gurg the following morning at sunrise, after a march of 35 miles from Nasratabad. Gurg, or Wolf, is considered to be one of the most appalling stages in the Lut, the water being almost undrinkable even for animals, and the heat in summer so great that even the Baluchis frequently die from it. When it is recollected that there is no water in any direction fox 30 miles, while a strong wind will obliterate the track in a few minutes, I think that the disadvantages of Gurg will be realized. In the after noon we continued the march, the track crossing the bitter Gurg river which has, quite erroneously, been regarded as the lower reach of the Rud-i-Mahi, and, crossing the level deserti hour after hour, at 21 miles we passed what is known as the Mil-i-Nadiri. G y some 15 feet of the burnt-brick column are standing, but 20 miles before reaching Fahraj wm passed a second column in an almost perfect state of pre servation, although the loss of many bricks round the base will soon bring it down. Its dimensions are—height, 55 feet; circum ference, 43 feet, and slightly tapering ; thickness of wall, 3 feet; and there is a staircase to the summit.* As the subject is of interest, I will again quote from the Seljuk history. ‘ Every three hundred paces a pillar twice the height of a man was built by Malik Kaward, so that by night from each pillar a second could be seen, in order that no one should lose his way. At the top of the valley, where the pi lars began, a caravanserai, a tank, and a bath were constructed; and two minars were built between Gurg and Fahraj, one forty gaz t in height and the other twenty-five gaz, and under each minar a caravanserai and a tank.” None of the pillars are now standing, but many of their bases are still visible, while the caravanserai is that of Robat, where we halted between Nasratabad and Gurg. After marches exceeding 30 miles, we were delighted to see the village of Fahraj, which was, it is stated, held by the Afghans well into this century, and is mentioned by Edrisi. It has a popula tion of a thousand inhabitants, and supplies the cultivators for Nasra tabad ; it also boasts of one of the few date-groves of Narmashir. Lying on the right bank of a sluggish river, and possessing excellent camel-grazing and sweet water, it would have afforded us an enjoyable rest, but as information reached me that Captain Napier, of the Oxford shire Light Infantry, had passed through Bam, and would, in conse quence, be awaiting me at Kerman, we marched on, joining a twice- trodden route at the bridge of Azizabad, and, after a fast journey, entered Kerman on December 2. My first care after settling down was to organize and despatch a trial caravan to Quetta, Captain Webb Ware having kindly agreed to assist me in the matter. The exquisite carpets, the finest in the world, had never before been exported to India, and I felt that they should form the bulk of the venture; so for some weeks the merchant who * These measurements are taken from Sir F, Goldsmid’s ‘ Eastern Persia.’ f A gaz is approximately equivalent to a metre.25 Geo.—S^kes—Second Revise. agreed to embark on the enterprise (which I partly financed), brought up bales ot carpets, all of which were carefully examined by me before being passed. Two Baluch levies came across to act as guard, and with samples of Yezd silks, saffron, homespun, and pistachio, the little caravan, the pioneer of greater things, started. Fortune smiled on it, as His Excellency the Viceroy happened to visit Quetta at the period of its arrival, and the purchases he made were so considerable and drew such attention to the caravan that the carpets were all sold at a handsome profit. In 1900 the second and much more important caravan was equally successful, and I now consider the trade established, to the mutual benefit of Indo-Persian relations. Looking ahead, I venture to forecast that this trade route will, if fostered, be increasing in im portance when the other is a thing of the past. At the beginning of 1900 some weeks were spent by me at Yezd, where I enjoyed the hopitality of Mr. Fothergiil, of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and, happening to come across two manuscript histories, I was enabled to study the history of the “ City of the Sands.” The foundation of Yezd is universally ascribed to Alexander the Great, who built a fort to serve as a prison for his captors, these un fortunates being confined in a deep well. In reference to this, Hafiz says, “I was afraid of Alexander’s prison, sc. Yezd, and prepared to start for the country of Suliman, sc. Ears.” Apparently the city was known by some other appellation, as the name of Yezd was given it by Yezdigird, the father of Bahram Gur, who reigned during the fifth century. After the Mohammedan conquest, the district became the headquarters of the followers of the old religion, who still number six thousand. In the thirteenth century, Marco Polo speaks well of Yasdi, and not long afterwards the Friar Odoricus visits Geth, as he terms it; but the best description of all is given by Josafa Barbaro in the fifteenth century. He says, “ We came to Jex, a towne of artificers, as makers of sylkes, fustians, chamletts, an 1 other like . . . they all arr wevers and makers of divers kindes of sylkes which came from Straua,* * * § from Azzi, and from the cities towards Zagatai; towards the sea of Bachu,f the best whereof come from Jex, w ch , w th their workes, do afterwards furnishe a great parte of India, Persia, Zagatai, Cim and Macim J parte of Catay, of Bursia § and of Turchie; wherefore left him that woll bie good silkes of Soria,|| faire and well wrought, take of these.” If Approached from the east in a sandstorm, the effect is extremely weird. Rolling sand-dunes are passed through, and nothing can be seen of the city, except a forest of wind-towers, dominated by two of the lofty gateways with minars which are peculiar to Yezd, the whole giving a marvellous sense of unreality. Travellers generally point to the fact that the sand touches the walls of Yezd as a proof that it is slowly being engulfed. This is, however, not the case, as it is the town that is encroaching on the dunes, which are steadily being enclosed and cultivated. During my stay, after a considerable amount of inquiry, two manu script histories were produced, one of which, known as the Tarikh-i- Jadid, or ‘Modern History,’ and written some six hundred years ago, gives a good account of the chief buildings. The Yezd of that date lay, in pait, a little to the north-west of the present city, and its oldest building is the Masjid-i-Jama. This was originally constimcted in a.h. 513 (1119), by Sultan Ala-u-Dola, Gurshasib, of the Kanjar tribe. It is related that Yezd was given to him, at his request, by Malik Shah, as a place to pray in, and that its designation of Dar-ul-Ibada, or “ Place of Prayer,” dates from this period. The mosque, which the son-in-law of the governor showed us over, is entered through one of the high gateways referred to above by two doors which are magnificent specimens of wood carving, but will in a few years disappear, no attempt being made to keep them in repair. The mosque itself lies at right * Astrabad. t The sea of Bachu or Baku is the Caspian. J Chin and Machin, sc. China. § Bursia is apparently Basra. H Syria, I presume. Tf ‘ Travels of Early Venetians,’ p. 73.26 Geo.— S^kes—Second Kevise. angk s to the gateway. Its great dome is nearly bare, bnt the interior is still perfect, and the mosaic work presents a fine appearance. On the Mehrab the date a.h. 877 (1472) is worked into the mosaic, while it also appears on a tablet under the gateway, evidently of the period of the last restoration. We saw the ruins of a Garm Khana, or “ Hot House,” where prayers are said during the winter, which were said to cover the ancient site of a fire-temple; this fact the Parsis corroborated. Close to the fort, which dates from a.h. 532 (1137), but is of little interest, is a building, called the Yukt-i-Saat, of which only a dilapi dated dome with a large hole is left. It is, however, ornamented with Kufic characters in dark blue, light green, and brown, which, on the white, produce a most harmonious and artistic effect. This is all that remains of an observatory, a college, and a clepsydra, that must have been of great splendour at the time of its completion in a.h. 725 (1324).* Yezd was evidently at its zenith just about this period, as the shrine of Taki-u-Din, Da la Mohamed, dates from the following year, a.h. 726 (1325). Lying outside the present city, it contains a fresco representing Ali, his two s &gt;us, and his two favourite servants, Suliman Farsi and Kambar Ali—the latter a black slave—and is commonly known as the shrine of Sheikh Dad. The Meidan-i-Mir-Chakmak is the square of Yezd, that contains the second high gateway and a well-pre-erved mosque, Mir Chakmak having been ruler of Yezd in the ninth century of the Hijra, and it was he who repaired the great mosque. In this square is an octagonal tile- covered erection some 9 feet in height, with a circumference of perhaps 20 feet. It is termed a kalak, which usually signifies a clay bowl used as a brazier, and during the month of Moharram it is a centre for the reading of the Passion play, a fire being lighted when necessary, and lamps burning in the niches. It is interesting to know that this kalak, so far as Mohammedans are concerned, is peculiar to the Yezd district and Kashan, where dari t is still the common tongue, and as the Parsis have these kalak in their shrines, it appears that they have been locally adopted by the Mohammedans; at Kerman they are termed magribi, or west, evidently in imitation of the Mohammedan kibla. But enough of ancient Yezd ; let us turn to the city of to-day. Still retaining a considerable manufacture of silk, Yezd is even more important as a commercial emporium, most of tbe goods imported for Khorasan changing hands in its somewhat mean bazaars, which are, * The description of this wonderful piece of mechanism runs as follows :— “ Opposite the entrance of the madresa are two columns, ou one of which there is a copper bird, and this bird always looks towards the sun and swings round. On the other column is a flag that appears five times a day, when the drum should be beaten. On the minar, in the middle of the observatory, was a wooden wheel painted. It was divided into 360 divisions ; each division had degrees, showing every day that the sun rises, in letters representing numbers. On the four corners of the wheel four circles appeared. On each circle were thirty divisions, and the name of the month was written in Turki, Bumi, Arabic, and Jalali (i.e. Persian of the new era). Every day that passes has one division. From two little windows above the wheel two bronze birds appear, and throw bronze dice into a bowl that is placed below the birds. Then the wheel moves, and of twelve white boards that show the twelve hours one falls, and a black board comes into its place, and at the five times (sc. of prayer), when the die falls, the drum inside the observatory is struck, and the flag appears on the minar. The circle is drawn to the top of the wheel, and thirty white circles are placed on it. Every day of the month one of the circles will be black, and on these circles the whole of that month is written. And on another side, opposite the clock, twelve other boards are placed, and at night, when one hour passes, one lamp of the twelve that are placed appears again. In the middle of this wheel there is a zone or zodiac, on which the names of the forty-seven stages of the zone are written. Also, above the circle of the zodiac, the names of the five great planets, Zohal, Mushtari, Otarid, Marikh, and Zohre, were written, and the description of every day and of every star {i.e. whether auspicious or the reverse). “Inside the observatory was a cistern, twice the height of a man, made of copper. Every day it was filled with water, and copper dishes were fastened by a chain on the surface of the water. And below that cistern an astrolobe of bronze is constructed, and from one side of the machine the water comes out from the hole, and as the water of the cistern decreases the dishes sink, and the whole of the works are moved by that water; and small bowls, hung up like trays, show the minutes, and every minute a hammer is struck on them, and gives forth a sound, and low down in the observatory is a wooden window, with a wooden bolt, and it is from this that the sound comes out.” f Dari is either a contraction for Darbari, i.e. the language of the court, or is, more probably, from dar, “ a gate.” Of. the Sublime Porte.Geo.—Sykes—Second Eevise. 27 however, supplemented by large caravanserais, while it is also the centre of the henna trade, and, in a lesser degree, of the export of opium. Only growing at most three months’ supply of grain in the district, Yezd, thanks to the commercial activity of its inhabitants, and m spite of the chronic insecurity of the roads, has a large class of wealthy merchants, and is therefore popular governorship. Sad to say, however, the blighting curse of opium-smoking is as much on the increase here as elsewhere in Persia, with every likelihood of ruin ing the whole nation, for the vice spreads by leaps and bounds, until smoking is carried on quite openly. The Parsis, who undoubtedly surpass their fellow-countrymen in the qualities of enterprise and hard work, are now beginning to advance along the path of progress, although their dasturs, or priests, are opponents of all enlightenment. The climate of Bombay being un healthy for the Yezd Parsi, who sees the phjsical degeneration of his countrymen, he generally returns to his home, even although Be may not ride an ass inside the town. I may note that Yezd has a hot and trying summer, but, owing to its great dryness, the climate is healthy, while the winter months are bracing. The Imperial Bank of Persia is now firmly established; while the unwearying devotion of Dr. White of the Church Missionary Society and staff, and the fair dealing of our countrymen, have changed the townspeople from being fanatical opponents of Europeans into adopting a friendly attitude, the recently constructed hospital being daily thronged. My visit in 1900 was a striking proof of this, as the three leading mullas, who between them hold Yezd in the hollow of their hands, all visited me, and, as the ice has once been broken and friendly intercourse established on a sure footing, I am confident that Yezd will slowly answer to the friendly pressure that is being exerted, and benefit thereby, if slowly yet surely. To return to my journeys, to the south-west of Kerman is an unexplored triangle of upland country lying between the Baft and Sirjan roads which I had been anxious to explore for many years; while, having read that the ancient capital of the province was to be jound in Sirjan, my keenness was naturally accentuated. It was not until April, 1900, that the longed-for opportunity presented itself, and, leaving Kerman, we marched across the plain to Jupar. Our second stage was Bahramjird, the meeting-place between Jelal-u-Din of Khiva, who strove to stem the Moghul invasion, and the disloyal Borak Hajib ; while, a few years later, it was undoubtedly a stage on the route of the illustrious Marco Polo, who was then bound for Camadi * and Hormuz. From Bahramjird we swung due west to Nagar, where there are interesting ruins which at one period were used as a mosque. Only the walls are standing, which show clear signs of having been built at two periods; to the later, a brick minar with a blue band of Kufic inscription must be assigned. The mehrab, until quite recently, bore an inscription dated a.h. 615 (1218), and as it is set towards Jerusalem, we may feel confident that this was originally a Christian place of worship, there having been, as is well known; a Nestorian bishop of Kerman.f At Nagar we had struck the main Bandar Abbas Kerman road, which we decided to follow as far as Baft, and, after crossing the level plain for some miles, we rose across the Zarchi pass, which was aflame with the yellow flowers of a bush termed durrnun. A narrow valley separated us from the frowning range of Bid Khan, across which is a pass, termed Soghurk, explored by the indefatigable Khan Bahadur. Crossing and recrossing the river, which, after watering Mashiz, is lost to the north of Baft, we ascended to the pass that bears the ominous name of Kafanu, or Shroud; but in April the snow had melted away, and the gradients are so easy that cavalry could gallop across it. Indeed, although its altitude is 9300 feet.j; it could, without much difficulty, be kept open all the year round. On the southern slope of the pass is the district of Kiskan, the summer quarters of the Lak, one of the most ancient Persian tribes, while on the bare open plain lies the large village of Baft. * Camadi is the Komadin of the history of Seljuks. t The Rev. C. Stileman, of the Church Missionary Society, was the first to identify these ruins, t My aneroids were unreliable during this tour.28 Geo.—Sykes—Second Revise. We had now reached the 29th parallel of latitude, which I had decided was to be my southern limit for the survey, and once again we marched due west into unexplored country. During the second stage from Baft we crossed the watershed of the Halib Rud, the most important river in the province, and then descended into the basin draining into the great havir of Persia. As is so often the case we filled in this blank on the map with numerous villages and hamlets, before reaching Saiidabad,t the capital of Sirjan. Some 6 miles to the east we visited the Kala-i-Sang, or Stone Fort ” which is also known as Kala-i-Beiza, or “ Fort Egg. It rises m glorious whiteness s ^me 300 feet above the plain, and, as its name implies, is egg-shaped. Approached from the north, this remarkable limestone crag is surrounded at some 50 yards from its base y a ow mu brick wall, which bore traces of having been rebuilt on older foundations. Inside this we found a 1 eautiful stone pulpit, some 5 feet high on one side of which were four perfect and one obliterated row of Aaskh } inscription, which ran as follows “ A sovereign, great, jmt, glorious and victorious, Sultan Ahmad.” The date was a.h. 789 (1387) and Sultan Ahmad, better known as Imad-u-Din, was a member of the Muzaffar dynasty. He ruled Kerman for many years, and vvas wi h he other members of the family, put to death by Timur in a.h. 796 (1393). Moving round to the south-west corner, where, as also at the north east angle, there is a high traverse wall, we entered tbe fort by its only approach. On the right-hand side, just below a brick dam, we read with some difficulty a second inscription, or rather a portion o it: “ In this blissful abode Amir Azam Husein-ibn-Ali constructed the ham-mam.'' The date was anything between a H. 410 (1019) an a.h. 420 (1029), the third cypher being illegible. The mdivi ua commemorated was probably the Deilamite Governor. The cra^ r n from north-east to south-west, and is some 400 yards in length anu perhaps half as much in width, the north-east end being the highes • There are practically no remains on the summit, everything avmg been washed away, but facing the pulpit is a fine grotto known as the “ King’s Seat,” where the name of Mohamed Shah is finely chiselled. Below is a second grotto, known as the Anderun, or “ Women’s Quarters. ’ I was fortunate in picking up half a reflet tile, but this was t le only antiquity forthcoming, and descending we examined the sout ern side of the city, where there are two walls, one 40 yards and t e ot er 200 yards from the base of the “ Akropolis.” This, then, was the ancient capital of Kerman, and possib y, nay probably, the Karmana of the ancients, in which connection I cannot do better than quote from Afzal Kermani, who writes in a.d. 1 * * * § “ Among the divisions of Kerman is Sirjan, the ancient capital o ar sir, a fine fertile district, ... and in it are many old graves; an travellers and Sufis term it Lesser Syria. And there is a great or reaching to the clouds. During the reign of Arslan Shah § it was repaired and again destroyed. To-day it is occupied.” So far as 1 could gather, the Kala-i-Sang was captured by Timur’s forces, and when the small remnant of the population was again collected, Shahr Biumidi, or “City of Despair,” as it was appropriately termed, was founded. During the Afghan invasion the Kala-i-Sang was again occupied, but was captured, and, the Shahr-i-Biumidi having been destroyed, a certain Mirza Saiid founded the present capital, which has a population of perhaps 10,000 inhabitants, close to the Shahr Biumidi. The Jcalantar informed me that he was married to a descendant o Mirza Saiid, who was evidently the local governor. The plain o Sirjan lies at an elevation of 5300 feet, and is in every way richer and mm-fi fertile than Kerman: so that it is evident that it was onl^ aban * This name was given by the Arabs, and is perhaps a corruption of Hari , the river that forms the eastern boundary of Persia for so many miles. Ammianus Marcellinus (xxiii. 6. 48) mentions the Sagareus, the Saganis, and the Hydnaous as the rivers of Kerman, and as the Halil is by far the most important, it must be one of them. f The universal spelling of Saidabad is incorrect. X Naskh is copperplate Arabic. § Arslan Shah was the sixth Seljuk ruler of Kerman, who reigned from a.h. 4bb to a-h. 537 (1101 to 1142).'ueo. Sykes—Second Revise. 29 doned as being too exposed for a capital.* It was the second week in May when we left Saiidabad and shaped our course for a flat-topped hill known as Takht-i-Tanbur,f or Throne of Timur, the route we followed lying to the east of the one shown on the. map. Halting at Amirabad, I was visited by the brother of the chief of the Karai tribe, or rather of its Kerman branch, under whose guidance we entered the hills, and, striking a small river at Sukta Chal, a hamlet of Seiids, ascended to the headquarters of the tribe at Tangru, probably a contraction of Tang-i-Rud,* where some two hundred black tents were pitched. From this stage we again tolWed the river to the village of Takkia, where the chief of the Buchakchi visited me. He is quite a Persian Robin Hood, and a few years previously had held Sirjan for a considerable period, pretending at he had been appointed governor, and writing imaginary tele grams whenever he was getting the worst of it. Continuing the journey a mile above Takkia, we passed a remarkable spring termed Abbad, where the water bubbled up with considerable noise, but at a normal temperature. It is evidently the spring about which the late bir Oliver St. John was told of as “bubbling up to a great height with a noise that is audible a farsalch off.” § Ihe mountains were thickly covered with scrub and the stunted tree from which gum is extracted, and we crossed the pass known as Seh Grudan || at an elevation of some 9000 feet. We thence descended into a steep valley crowded with willows, and, skirting the Chehel Ian range, camped on the mountain slope at a village that is termed . aai ang. Ibis was our last cold night, a short march bring ing us to Mashiz, which, in the middle of the nineteenth century, was occupied by Agha Khan for some months. At this point I struck my first journey in Persia, and two days later Kerman was again reached after a most interesting tour. In July, 1900, I climbed the Kuh-i-Shah, which I had ascended in 1895, and Kuh-i-Hezar was next scaled. It also rises to nearly 14,000 feet, and in shape is a gigantic hog’s back, the climb not being difficult. The term Eezar, or Thousand, is said to refer to the number of its plants. In any case, a botanist could not do better than start work m this range, where the number and variety of scented bushes was extraordinary. During this tour the little district of Givar, to the east of Sardu, was given an existence on the map; and I returned to Kerman, having explored the whole of its highlands. I had been told by a Khan that, while laying out a garden in Khina- man, a large number of bronze arrow-heads had been dug up, and as the district lying due west of Kerman was a blank on the map, I decided to ascertain whether or no my friend had made an interesting discovery. When I reached Khinaman, I found that some 5 feet below the surface hundreds of tombs had been struck. The corpses were dust, so that it could not be ascertained in what direction they had been laid. In each tomb was a small jar of pottery and the following articles in bronze, viz. a round bowl, a pair of bracelets, two pins, and four or five arrow and spear heads. An axe-head representing a fish and two handles that apparently fitted some weapon completed the list of what was to be seen, my host having allowed almost everything to be thrown away. Of the bowls there were three shapes, one being evi dently a.lamp of a primitive kind. I was also told of a corneliao,f a pair of silver bracelets, and a lozenge-shaped earring of the same metal. Great jars full of yellow dust, probably wheat, had also been found and well-burnt bricks. The jars I saw, and found them wider and more squat than those of to-day. The yellow dust had all been thrown away. * In the Journal of the Eoyal Asiatic Society of April, 1901, Mr. Guy le Strange relying on the itineraries of the Arab travellers, considers that the capital was else where ; but these worthies are most inaccurate. t Cf. “ We’ll lead you to the stately tent of war, Where you shall hear the Scythian Tamhurlaine Threatening the world with high astounding terms.” Marlowe.

On an adjacent cliff were the ruins of a fine old stone fort, hut there were no traditions except that Aza Mahan, the founder of Mahan, or Mahun, had built a village in the district, which had sent a levy of seven warriors mounted on bulls to aid Yezdijird, the last monarch of the house of Sassau. Close by were other tombs, in which the corpses had not quite become dust, and which contained jars of a different shape and fragments of iron, probably arrow-heads, so that Khinaman is rich indeed in antiquities. In November the drum of departure was again beaten, and by the end of the month Jiruft was reached, which I thoroughly explored while waiting for Lieut. Crookshank, r.e. I discovered several other ruined cities besides Marco Polo’s Camadi, all of which had apparently been destroyed by floods. In fact, so dense had the population been that for miles a line of towns and villages had existed which almost touched one another. At Bagh-i-Babu, a few miles south of Camadi, an alabaster vase was dug up that is considered by the British Museum to be an ungent vase of Greek manufacture dating from the fourth century b.c. This discovery is, I would urge, of the greatest importance, as Edrisi mentions the city of Hormuz-ul-Malik—it was a ruin in his day—as having been the capital of the province before Svijan, so here at last we may locate the “ Karmana Omnium mater ” of Ammianus Marcellinus, and it was surely here that Alexander the Great was resting when he received the welcome visit of way-worn Nearchos. When joined by Lieut. Crookshank, we slowly marched towards Gulashkird,* which was certainly on Marco’s route, and then swung west to explore another Kuh-i-Shah, which has the same legends as its namesake near Kerman. At Dolatabad, in Urzu, the objects of my tour having been accomplished, I sent back my Persian secretary to Kerman, and marched rapidly down to Bandar Abbas. A good deal of rain had fallen, and there was doubt as to whether the famous or infamous defile known as Tang-i-Zindan, or “Prison Defile,” would not be closed. For some 20 miles the track runs up and down river-beds, and many caravans have been swept away by irresistible floods. Fortune, however, smiled on us, as we were in the tang a day after a spate, and safely emerged on to the plain, quaintly termed Formosa by Marco Polo. The contrast between the population of this coast strip and that of the highlands was most noticeable, and the surveyor said that, but for the palm groves, everything reminded him of the Panjab, from the creaking water-wheels to the dress or undress of the peasantry. At Bandar Abbas I stayed with Captain Hunt, who had been commissioned to found a vice consulate, and two days later I started for South Africa. At Karachi a coolie ship was just starting for Mombasa, and by great good fortune I caught a Mauritius steamer at the lovely Seychelles, where I enjoyed the hospitality of Mr. Harold Baty. At Mauritius Mr. Ireland entertained me, and early in March I finally reached South Africa. There I twice crossed the Karroo f and imagined myself back in Persia, while the ruins in Rhodesia struck me as akiil to the gorbasta of Baluchistan, which, indeed, is not at all impossible. To conclude, until wounded I had the great honour of serving in command of Welsh Yeomanry under Lord Methuen, who is as much admired by his division as he is feared by the stubborn Boers. * Edrisi gives Kanat-ul-Sham, Maun, and Walasgird as the three stages. Maun is Moghun, and Walasgird is Gulashkird. t Rudyard Kipling’s lines apply to Persia just as well as to the Karro. They run: “ Royal /Geo. Sykes— Discussion—First Proof. 31 here P a P er ’ t ^ le President said : Many of you who are read to ns fn 18 evemn “ w i|J remember the very interesting paper Major Sykes valuahlft ur J'-ars ago. Since that time he has done a prodigious amount of Pleas,,™ g f e ° gr i aphl ? al and P oli t'cal work in Persia, and now we have the great pleasure of welcommg him here again. I call upon Major Sykes to give us his A ter Jie reading of the paper, the following discussion took place:— l ': H ° MAS H °“ ICH : Some y ears ago. ''hen we first heard of Major Sykes’s think ver'Hf m r dl&amp;Cul . t aDd dangerous country to the east of the Caspian, I led him us aatici P ated w hat the conclusion of a career would be which gvke ■ m a h !i C °n SU at ! at Kerman - for i,; is 00 figure of speech to say that Major there’}, 1 ^ ^ C J °° Sulate at Ke rman, and that by his energy and his capacity If von i* 8 Tu 6 r '^ s ^ P res tige on a pedestal such as it never occupied before. « elt hi oriea F^T K9mAn 0n th « « H does athwart one Persia T th l! r0Ute ’m d nght aCr0SS another g reat route f rom India to Western mflnenee t'k f U agree with me that the 8 ^er,gth or weakness of British comm t n quarter cann0t fail t0 affect all relations, whether political or commercial or s rateg,cal, that at present lie between India and Persia ; nor can it n tne luture fad to he an important factor in the settlement of the final q estion thi r.T wheQever that ver y difficult political nut comes to be cracked. I really horS ^ 'TTf 1 the many developments which have taken place on the Indian borderland of late years, the foundation of the Kerman Consulate is one of the nost important. I can personally testify, as nobody else can, to the extraordinary 10 uence which Major Sykes exercised over the people with whom he had to deal in that quarter. It was an influence gained by just those same qualities of ready adaptability to the country and the people with whom he had to do, of keen insight and participation with their sports and pistimes, just the same qualities which afterwards fitted him so well to become a distinguished leader of yeomanry m the fields of South Africa under one of the best of our fighting generals. But it is 1 ^^ to the geographical side of his work I should like to direct your attention. Major Sykes has not mentioned that he was assisted, at any rate in later years, by one of the staff of native assistants in the Survey of India, one Asgar^ All, a patient, painstaking, hardworking topographer, who, under Major ysess direction, has succeeded in secuiing a very fine acquisition of fresh geo graphy m that country. Now, it is exactly to this particular combination of good and intelligent leadership and sound professio, al assistance that we have most to hope for in future geographical fields, and those fields are very large. As^ar Ali is one of my old staff, and he only represents one of many such. We do not want one man or two men, or a few men in driblets, but we want companies of men of the same sort, m the same way that Russia has them, or that America has them, or, in short as most civilized countries possess them, except our own country England. I should like, if I could, personally to be able to testify to the value ot the work which has been done, but unfortunately I have not had the oppor tunity of traversing so much of the country as Major Sykes has. However, I feel sure that a great future lies before us in that direction, and I trust that’under such leadership as Major Sykes’s, and with the assistance of such men as Asgar Ah, we may yet make a clean sweep of all that is unknown in those out-of-the- way districts in Southern Persia, and really establish ourselves in the forefront of geographers in the world. .^ r : C ’ Eeab: 1 sha11 venture to say a few words on quite a different part of Major Sykes’s explorations from those that have been treated by Sir Thomas Holdich. I have not had the privilege, as Sir Thomas Holdich has, of visiting ersia, but for many years past it Has been a pleasure to me to study the remains of antiquity that have come from that country, and I should like to say a few words with regard to some of the objects that you have seen or may see in the tea-room, that Major Sykes has brought here this evening. First among these and I think almost the most beautiful, are the beautiful tiles—iridescent tiles’ both ancient and modern, of which he has a very good series. Now, these tiles are, I think, without exception the most beautiful ceramic products that the world has ever seen. That may sound a strong statement, but I think it will be borne out if the comparison is made with the best products of all the pottery manufac tures of the world. To me it seems that these charming tiles—they are mostly tiles; we have seen in the slides some of the vases, but these are somewhat too fragile to carry about, as Major Sykes says—it seems to me that these tiles have a peculiar interest for us, although it may be that the genealogy of them is rather long. Here in Persia, so far as we know the whole length of it, these beautiful pieces of pottery have been made during many centuries; from there they have been traded to the West, and they have come to what is now Turkey. There they have been adapted and adopted very largely, and they cover the mosques in Constantinople and other provinces. Once they get to the Mediterranean the spread is very easy. The Moors carried them to Spain, and there in the four teenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries we get an analogous ware with analogous beauties to those of the original pat'ern. From Spain they come to Italy under the form of majolica, from Italy to Holland, and from Holland to our ordinary common English. That is, as I say, rather a long pedigree, but it shows us that we have to this day, in a word in common use, the word “ delf,” a bond which unites us wiih the best artistic period of Persia, and I would commend to you who love beautiful things—aud I have no doubt most of you do—an exami-32 Geo.—Sykes—Discussion—First Proof. nation of the older tiles (I am afraid I have a preference for the older ones) shown in the tea-room. Many of the specimens there date from the thirteenth and fourteenth century. There must, in fact, be much older ones, because no an sprung into completeness and beauty, such as these tiles of the “thirteenth and fourteenth century, without a long period of probation. These older ones must exist, no doubt do exist, but how are we to find them? They do not exist in the mosques; they have probably been destroyed to make room for tbe more modern ones. They must be looked for on the sites of the old potteries, and there they will be found, I have no doubt, as Major Sykes has found fragments in various places. So far with regard to the pottery, which I think will share with the carpets, of which Major Sykes spoke in such high terms, and deservedly so, the credit of being one of the artistic beauties of Persia. Another instance of their artistic work is seen in the bronze arrow-heads and axe-heads which Major Sykes described as having been found in a tomb by a friend of his, which he after wards examined on the site. These objects are all bronze, and that leads us to believe that they belong to what is known as the age of bronze, by which is meant the age before iron came into use, before it was known as a metal. This may be so, it probably is; but it must not be forgotten that when one speaks of the age of bronze, it has only a local significance: the age of bronze in Persia may be a very different period in chronology than the age of bronze in the Mediter ranean. No doubt the Mediterranean, or at any rate tbe countiies not very far from it, have a particular bearing upon some of these objects that Major Sykes has shown here this evening. In the tea-room there is an axe which is in every way a very curious axe; it is a kind of double-bladed axe with a great crest on one side and a very curious blade on the other, and in the middle a design, which, I dare say, will be a sealed book to most inexperienced eyes that look at it, but fortunately we have an axe in the British Museum more or less analogous to it, and which was found—and this is the important point—no nearer than Armenia, which is a very long way off here, veiy near the Black Sea. This axe from Armenia, which is not very far from the Mediterranean, which is the home of the beginning of culture,—this axe of the Mediterranean has upon it, on the back of the axe—the side away from the blade—an ordinary figure of a lion. Now, if you bear that in mind, and look at this axe in the tea-room, I think you will see that the lion has become reduced to a mere survival of the outlines of a lion ; that the blade, in place of being a us ful blade, has been turned down and stands at right angles, and has become useless as a blade, and the whole thing has become the mere symbol of an axe. A warlike people who invent an axe for a particular purpose are very careful to see that it shall serve the purpose for which it was made—to cut a skull well. An axe in Armenia has all these qualities; but here we come to what is merely the survival of an axe, the ceremonial of the thing, which shows not only the distance through which the type has travelled, but also the difference in age which lies between these two objects. The arrow-heads themselves are of the common form, the ordinary leaf-shaped form, which is certainly the most effective for an arrow-bead; but there is nothing in that which gives us any idea of the date. What will tell us is excavation. There is nothing to be done in a country like this except excavation. History is so entirely covered with legend and story that it is not to be relied upon. I think even the most ardent Greek present would admit that the Greek stories tf the early history of Persia are very little more than legend. What we want is excavation, and I think that if we could make excavations on certain of these selected sites, which were great cities either in medieval times or in the times of Alexander the Great, we should make very great discoveries; but there is a reason, I am sorry to say, why we cannot do this. A few years ago—-I forget how many—the French Govern ment obtained a monopoly for the excavation of antiquities in Persia, a monopoly which forbids England or any other country from making excavations of this kind. It seems to me that it showed considerable indifference towards tue progress of knowledge on the part of those responsible, that in England we should have let an opportunity like this pass without making some kind of purchase, at any rate for a district of Persia, which might have been left for the energies of our friend Major Sykes. What I hope to see is, when this monopoly comes to an end, that our Major Sykes, and probably others like him—he will agree that there is work for more than one—will be allowed to make excavations in Kerman, and that in time by excavations we may know something of the history of early Persia. Sir Henry Howorth : I should like, if I might, to add two or three words to what has just been said about my friend Major Sykes, and .two or three words entirely from the point of view of the extreme interest of the district which he has explored, and to which I have devoted many of the years of my life to writing an account. I will limit myself to a very few sentences, but there are three points which seem to me to be of particular interest. To my mind this district of the world is the most tragical of all parts of the world in regards to its history. In a great many other countries we have huge deserts which have always been more or less huge deserts; here we know that almost every part of the country must in early times have had extremely flourishing settlements. Take that district of : they found a wonderfully thriving population; its history goes back a long way. Then there is the country of the Sarkas, who have this remarkable interest—that they conquered the larger part of the north-west of India, and they founded the great state of Sarkastina, and when Sir Thomas went to India, heGreo.—Sykes—Discussion—First Proof. 33 stayed with, and was entertained by the great king of these Sarkas. And we have within the last five-and-twenty years recovered some of the coins of this man, and that is very interesting, because they confirm his life, which is thought to be verv mythical, but which is anything but mythical. And we not only recovered the coins of the king, but the coins of his father were also mentioned in this extra ordinary life of Sir Thomas. That shows you how interesting it would be if, as my friend said, we could only put the spade into the ground. We have the greatest possible assurance that the ground must be teeming with most interesting objects. Now we will turn to Kerman, which Major Sykes made so long the centre of his explorations. When we speak of the Turks we think of the European Turks, but the real Turks were the civilized Turks, the Turks that did more than any other nomad race for raising Asia out of the slough of despond. They founded a very famous dynasty at Kerman, and its history has just been published for the first time in the original, and I hope in the course of a few months we shall have a complete translation of it. There is one other point I wish to mention. Along that seaboard where Alexander lost so many man, where they lay there are tracts of splendid aromatic shrubs; that coast is dotted all over with a name derived or connected with the old name Kash. Now, all this is so very interesting, because we have all kinds of evidence of these extraordinary black races coming from the Indus right to the south of Baluchistan and Kerman and the Western Caspian ; we have the remains of this continuous black race, whose language is still spoken by some of the hill tribes in Baluchistan, and which proves to be so like the languages of the tribes of India. This fact arouses all sorts of interest. Before Persia was invaded and conquered by what were called the Iranians, this district was occupied by a black race speaking a language something like that spoken by some of the tribes ol India. The people of Kash were the first inaugurators of culture and civilization. I am saying a few things in my own way, but I have not been able to say much about the history of Persia of which the President has written such an admirable and interesting and condensed account. It is the only history of Persia that I know now in one volume which is both readable and accurate and excellent, and I have no doubt he will tell us, when he comes to speak out of the cornucopian knowledge which he always has at command, a great deal more than it is possible for me to tell you. I may say I have listened to the lecture with the enormous admiration one has for the first person who, since the time of the followers of Alexander, has united India and Persia by trade and commerce, and by something better than trade and commerce—by the good reputation of an Englishman. The Chairman : I am afraid it is too late to enter upon any further details of the history of Persia, but we have a duty to perform, and that is to express our thanks to Major Sykes for what he has told us and what he has shown us. Sin Thomas Holdich, a great authority, has very fully explained to us the immense value of the public services of Major Sykes in Persia by establishing the Consulship at Kerman, and by opening the trade route from Kerman to Quetta along that very country in which Alexander the Great and his army nearly perished from thirst. But what I think must strike most of us, as it has struck me, with regard to the work of Major Sykes, is the exhaustive and complete manner in which he acquaints himself with the country and the people among whom he has to live and to serve. I do not think, as a Persian traveller, that there has been one since the time of Sir Henry Rawlinson who has combined so great a knowledge of Persian history with his most valuable geographical investigations. We have to thank Major Sykes, and I think we may do so for his great public services in Persia as well as for his contributions to geography. To-night we have to thank him for his most interesting paper and for all the beautiful sketches he has shown us, an above all for allowing us to see that magnificent collection of Kermanic carpets, and of the tiles which have been described to us by Mr. Read, and of the othe antiquities which you will now be able to examine in the tea-room. I propose cordial vote of thanks to Major Sykes.Dated Mauritius, the 28th July 1900. From—His Excellency Reab-Admiual D. H.

Memorandum respecting Koweit. THE position of Koweit, as regards Turkey, has recently given rise to considerable dis cussion. There seems no doubt that in 1871, when Midhat Pasha made a successful attempt to reduce the Emir of Nejd to subjection, the Sheikh of Koweit declared himself on the Turkish side, assumed the Turkish flag, and was instrumental in inducing other Chiefs on the Arabian Littoral of the Persian Gulf to imitate his example. Eor this action he received the title of Pasha, and was granted considerable tracts of land in the neighbourhood of Eao. It would appear that about that time a Turkish custom-house was established at Koweit, hut it must have been maintained for a short time only. In 1876 Lieutenant &gt; Colonel Prideaux, the Acting Kesident at Eushire, enumerated as the principal Turkish ports on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf, Koweit, Khateef, and Ojair. India Office, In May 1878 the Government of India proposed ? 878 emb€r 17 ’ “ from Bussorah to Ojair ” (which is situated on the coast considerably to the south of Koweit) “ the authority of the Porte should be recognized as established on land, but that at sea the British Government should con tinue to exercise some concurrent Protectorate, pursuing pirates if necessary into Turkish waters and dealing with them wherever found, whether at sea or on shore, within certain limits through the Besident in the Gulf.” This proposal was discussed between the Foreign Office and India Office and somewhat modified. To Sir A. Layard, In a despatch dated the 5th January, 1879, Is0, 12, Lord Salisbury authorized Sir A. La yard, then British Ambassador at Oonstantinople, to propose [929] B2 to the Porte an arrangement by which British ships of war should be instructed to pursue their operations for the repression of piracy as far as possible outside the territorial waters of the Arabian mainland north of Odeid, but should also have authority to pursue and capture piratical vessels within the 3-mile limit on that part of the coast wherever this might seem indispensable to the attainment of their object. This arrangement, which would by implication have admitted Turkish territorial sovereignty as far south as El Odeid (which is south of Ojair), str A. Layard, was mentioned hy Sir A. Layard to the Turkish njisso. Prime Minister and Minister for Eoreign Affairs, and submitted by them to the Council of Ministers, but got no farther. In August 1888, in consequence of a report To Sh-JV'. white, that the Turkish Government contemplated an August 29, 1888. attack on Oman, Sir W. White was instructed that Her Majesty’s Government recognized Turkish jurisdiction on the coast as far as El Khateef, and were anxious that it should be effec tively exercised within those limits. Beyond that point Her Majesty’s Government considered the Chiefs to be independent. (El Khateef, though situated to the north of Ojair and Odeid, is still considerably south of Koweit.) Sir W. White, in reply, called attention to No. 38], . £ m i • -u • • October 1, 1888. some recent practical assertions ot lurkish juris diction south of El Khateef, and represented that it would be difficult to lay down that Khateef was the hard and fast limit beyond which Turkish influence should not extend. He did not therefore make any statement on this point in his communication to the Porte protesting against any aggression on Oman. In April 1893 Sir C. Lord stated officially to the Turkish Minister for Eoreign Affairs that Her X Majesty’s Government admitted Turkish sove reignty from Bussorah to El Khateef. Two Memoranda, prepared in 1896-97, at the time wTien the present Sheikh Mubarak wus making efforts to consolidate the position he had acquired by the murder of his brothers, show considerable divergence between the views of British officials as to the actual status of Koweit at that time. The first, by Mr. Stavrides, legal adviser to in Mr. Herbert, the Embassy at Constantinople, contains the July 6 ’ 1 ’ 96 ' following:—In Sir P. Currie, Xo. -203, March 24, 1897. To Sir P. Currie No. 307, July 17, 1897. Inclosure in India Office March 24, 1897. India Office, April 7. Inclosure in India Office, October 15, 1897. “ The country of Koweit, although entirely inde pendent, figures in the maps as being a part of the Ottoman Empire; the reigning family possesses large landed property at Bussorah, and especially at Fao, which belongs to them. That is the reason why the Sheikhs accept their investiture sanctioned by the Sultan, who grants them the rank of Kaimakam, with the title of Pasha, of which the Sheikh does not deign to make use.” A subsequent Memorandum, by Captain Whyte, formerly Her Majesty’s Consul at Bns- sorab, directly traverses this view :— “Mr. Stavrides describes Koweit as being entirely independent, but it seems to me that the acceptauce by the Sheikh of an appointment from the Sultan as Ka'ima- kam precludes the possibility of any foreign Power re cognizing under the present conditions his inde pendence.” In view of these conflicting statements, Sir P. Currie, Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, inquired what was the view of Her Majesty’s Government in regard to Turkish authority. The answer was as follows :— “Her Majesty’s Government have never admitted that Koweit is under the protection of the Turkish Government. But since it is practically under Turkish influence, it is doubtful whether we could deny the latter.” The Government of India were at the time inclined to recognize Turkish authority in order to exact satisfaction from the Ottoman Govern ment for the alleged connection of Koweit with a piratical attempt on the Indian vessel “ Haripasa ” during the previous year. This was, however, decided to be inexpedient, and a pro posal for the appointment of a Commission containing both Turkish and Persian members was not pressed. By the autumn of 1897, the question of Koweit had assumed more serious political importance. The Sheikh Mubarak, despairing of obtaining from Turkey a recognition of his independence, had preferred a definite request for British protection. The answer of Her Majesty’s Government is conveyed in a telegram to the Government of4 1 India, stating that “ they are not disposed to interfere more than necessary for maintenance of general peace of Persian Gulf, or to grant pro tection to Kuweit.” But this declaration was afterwards modified. The Besident at Bushire was of opinion that Inclosure 4 in . 11 . +1 f Inni a Othce, Koweit was, in itself, desirable as a harbour , that \ ovem ij er i 3 ? its importance in relation to a possible railway No. 23. from Port Said was consul erable ; while the ex tension of the pax Britannica to Koweit, as to Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs of the southern shore, would further the ends of civilization by checking the growth of piracy and the Slave Trade. The Sheikh, though he had procured his title by a double murder, appeared to British officers in other respects a popular and enlightened Euler. It was urged (1) that the responsibility of protection would be amply repaid ; (2) that the Sheikh’s position was precarious. If our help were refused, he would make terms with Turkey or seek protection elsewhere, in either case changing the status quo to our disadvantage. Sir N O’Conor was consulted, but before any Sir N O’Conor, . .. No. 667, Secret, renlv was received from him the India Umce u ecem ber 22 , 1 ft 1 1 &amp; were informed as follows :— “ If the Government of India is of opinion that the Protectorate can be undertaken without difficulty, or any inconvenient extension of the duties of police already exercised in the Persian Gulf, Lord Salisbury would approve of such a step, and would be prepared to acquiesce in the establishment of such Protectorate, and to support it diplomatically in case the Porte should raise counter-claims.” Sir N. O’Conor’s observations were shortly afterwards received. While supporting generally the idea of a British Protectorate he pointed out that caution was necessary. A Minute existed recording a conversation, in 1889, between Sir A. Sandison, Oriental Secretary to Her Majesty’s Embassy, Constantinople, and the Grand Vizier, which implied a recognition of Turkish sovereignty as far as El Katif, and his Excellency w r as of opinion that any formal assertion of British Protectorate would pro duce very serious diplomatic complications. He thought, however, that “acts of piracy and of regular Traffic in Slaves would justify the interference of the Indian Government and afford ground for coming to a direct and special arrangement with the Sheikh, which need notTo India Office. January 4 and 18, 1899. necessarily be made public,” and such acts were of frequent occurrence. At this stage more decisive action was pre cipitated by the report of a Russian Railway Concession from Tripoli in Syria to Koweit. It was then proposed to enter into a separate engagement which was to take the form of a promise by the Sheikh not to alienate any portion of his territory to any foreign Power, and was to be considered distinct from the question of an ultimate British Protectorate. The Imperial Government merely availed themselves of the superior facilities for negotiation possessed by the Government of India, while in no way pledging the latter to accept any liability under any circumstances that might arise in the future. The proposition for the establishment of a Protectorate was tacitly dropped, though the Government of India were of opinion at the India Office, September 4,1899. Inclosure in India Office, February 14. Inclosuri in Sir N. O’Conor’s No. 259, May 24, 1899. time that the proposed negotiations would have a Protectorate as their final result. On the 23rd January, 1899, the Sheikh signed an Agreement* (to be kept absolutely secret) pledging himself not only to cede no territory but to receive no foreign Representative without British sanction. In return for this he was promised the good offices of Her Majesty’s Government, and a payment was made of 15,000 rupees from the Bushire Treasury. The Government of India were also authorized to instruct British naval officers to prevent by force any attempt on the part of the Turks to attack Koweit. The conclusion of the Agreement, however, involved a serious question regarding the property of the Sheikh in Turkish territory. Aliens are by Turkish law precluded from holding landed pro perty, and it was feared that, if the Sheikh were suspected of having agreed to a British Protec torate, the Turkish authorities would attempt to dispossess Mubarak of his property near Pao. The hope was, therefore, held out that the British Government would “ do what they could ” to protect him and his brothers in the matter. An appointment made at this time seemed likely to disturb the peaceful outlook. Hamdi Pasha, the new Yali of Bussorah, was intimately acquainted with the family history of the Sheikhs of Koweit, and opposed to the present Ruler. [929] * See Annex. c6 During Hamdi’s first tenure of office Mubarak bad procured the murder of his two brothers and usurped the Sheikhdom. Hamdi supported the claims of two nephews, urging upon the Porte the necessity for effective occupation of Koweit and the danger of recognizing a determined usurper who would aim at independence. . Por the moment, Mubarak’s position was precarious, but with much energy and decision he succeeded in buying every official of any importance and, finally, secured his investiture. Two years later the reappointment of Hamdi Pasha seemed to forebode the revival of a counter claim on behalf of the nephews, and, with it, m all probability, a reassertion of the dormant rights of Turkey. The outward and visible sign of Turkish supremacy in Koweit was the acceptance by the Sheikh of the post of Kaimakam, but though this is frequently mentioned in despatches, it seems, if Mr. Stavrides 5 view is correct, to be little more than a formal dignity incidental to the investiture, and accepted in respect of the property of the Sheikhs in Turkish territory. A local Quarantine Board on several occasions attempted to impose illegal and vexatious restric tions on British vessels in the Guff, but its protests were disregarded when clearly contrary to the Yenice Convention, and Colonel Meade understood that “the Quarantine arrangements under the Sanitary Board at Constantinople in no way implied that the Turks have any sort of jurisdiction or rights at Koweit.” In September it was reported that a Turkish Harbour-master had been appointed. This was considered a more serious matter, and for the first time since the conclusion of the Agreement it was proposed to intimate to the Porte the interest taken by the British Government in the Sheikh’s affairs. After consultation with the India Office, Sir N. O’Conor was informed by telegraph that this “ W as not a matter we could recognize as depending on the Porte. Turkish Government should be warned that we have friendly relations with the Sheikh, and that a disagreeable question would be raised if it was attempted to establish Turkish customs without previous agreement with Her Majesty s Government. A gun-boat was ordered to Koweit, but, at the suggestion of Sir jNT. 0 Conor, it was afterwards directed merely to call at Koweit and to come Mr. Stavrides in Mr. Herbert, July 6, 1896.

The Government was inclined to ho friendly, and to disclaim responsi bility for the appointment, which had been made by the Naval Commandant at Bussorah, and not by the central authority. Admiral Douglas had reported in February' that in case of attack the navy alone could undertake the defence of Koweit, and no further measures were taken. Hamdi Pasha was soon afterwards again dismissed. The cause of his fall is neither apparent nor important, but the effect was to replace a prominent official with a definite anti- English policy by a rival who, in order to main tain his position, was anxious for the moment to avoid controversial matters, and to limit the interference of his Government in the Sheikh’s affairs. But difficulties were already arising in a fresh direction. It had become apparent to the promoters of the German railway from Konia to Bagdad that an outlet upon the sea was vitally necessary to their scheme. They proposed, therefore, to acquire Kathama Bay at the -western end of Koweit Harbour, and Sir N. O’Conor reported that the Germans would in all probability negotiate directly with the Sultan without regard to the Sheikh of Koweit, who would not be asked to grant a concession of land. Lieutenant-Colonel Meade feared that the Turks and Germans com bined would take some action on the strength of which Turkish authority over Koweit might afterwards be claimed to exist. The impression prevailed that it was intended to take advantage of the entanglement of this country in South Africa to push the matter to a conclusion in conjunction with Turkey. In the opinion of Captain Denison, of the “ Melpomene,” then in the Gulf, £S the presence of the German Consul-General for Constantinople pointed to greater things than a simple railway terminus.” Colonel Meade’s views Avere unchanged : “ our OAA r n preponderating influence at the place must be maintained to the exclusion of any other.” The presence of Turkish, Russian, or German officials was equally injurious to our interests. Sir N. O’Conor pointed out that the enterprise was private and international rather than poll-tical. A friendly warning, lie thought, to the promoters of the scheme would obviate any official notification of our relations with the Sheikh, a course of action likely to induce an international scramble in which this country would at the moment he heavily handicapped. The view of Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople received confirmation some months later from Berlin. Count Billow informed Sir E. Lascelles that Sir F. Lascelles, the German Consul-General had been granted No ' 156, une 1 leave to accompany the Mission, not in his official capacity, but for his “ local knowledge.” In the month of April some more definite steps were taken towards an understanding with Germany. Sir N. O’Conor, while pointing out Sir N. O’Conor, in January that immediate action was inexpedient lgoo in view of the situation in South Africa, did not fail in April to make clear to the German Am bassador at Constantinople the full sense of our agreement with the Sheikh for non-cession of territory. Her Majesty’s Government, he said, had an Agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit which, although net opposed to the status quo yet prevented the Sheikh from making any con cession of territory to another Power without the consent of Her Majesty’s Government. Baron von Marschall said that he supposed this would not prevent the construction of a Xlailway, and that he was quite alive to the dis advantages of provoking any feeling in England which would have the effect of preventing British capital from taking part in the construction of the line. “ I was anxious,” Sir N. O’Conor proceeds, “ that no doubt should remain in his mind as to the position in which the Sheikh of Koweit stood towards Her Majesty’s Government, and to make it quite clear that the Sheikh was not at liberty to cede or otherwise alienate to the Kailway Company either the harbour of Kathama or any other part of his territory without the consent of Her Majesty’s Govern ment In the course of conversation he said that Koweit was a part of the Turkish Empire, to which I promptly replied that we did not want to disturb the status quo, but that the Sheikh was not a free agent ” At the same time his Excellency informed Tewfik Pasha that— “Her Majesty’s Government did not desire to inter fere with the status quo, or with the Sultan’s authority inIndia Office, April 21.

August 7. those parts, but that, in view of their great interests in the Persian Gulf, they could not view with indifference any action which would alter the existing condition of affairs or give another Power special rights or privi leges over territory belonging to the Sheikh, with whom Her Majesty’s Government had certain Agree ments.” Meanwhile, however, it was reported that the German Hailway Company had taken the matter into their own hands, and were already making arrangements for the construction of a pier. Sir N. O’Conor suggested the appointment of a British Secret Agent. The India Office, when consulted, replied that ££ until the question of policy was determined, the presence of a Secret Agent would be a mere waste of money.” At this juncture the Admiralty forwarded a report stating that two German steamers were expected to go to Koweit, and inquired what would he the jxdicy of Her Majesty’s Govern ment in the event of a collision between Germans and Arabs. The reply was that Lord Salisbury ££ scarcely thought that any definite instructions were neces sary until some confirmation was received of the reported intention of German ships to visit Koweit or until there was some indication of the methods of action they intended to pursue. If the con struction of a pier were attempted by private persons without a mandate from some recognized authority, the Sheikh would be within his rights in opposing such an attempt and, in this event, if any action was to be taken by Her Majesty’s' ships it should be in support of the Sheikh’s authority.’’ The India Office concurred while pointing out that the eventuality contemplated (in which alone action was to he taken) would in all probability never occur. After the summer of 1900 various incidents began to point to a renewal of Turkish interest in Koweit. In August the first of several attempts was made to induce the Sheikh to visit Bussorah, and Mubarak found some difficulty in avoiding direct communication with the Turkish authorities. In October the order of the Svetiaz was con ferred upon him as ££ Kaimakam ” of Koweit, and the ££ Ikdam” of the 10th November announced that at Mubarak’s request a mosque erected bv him was to be called after the name of the [929] d10 Sultan, the Sheikh again being given the full title of Mubarak-es-Sabah Pasha, Ka'imakam of Koweit. But an opportunity for more effective inter- Dispute between Koweit and Nejd. vention, of which the Turkish Government were now slow to avail themselves, was afforded by the growing dissension between Mubarak and the neighbouring Ruler of Nejd. The affair, which on its merits was little more than an intertribal squabble, led to political results of such importance that it is necessary to describe in some detail the course of the struggle. The quarrel arose from a raid by Sheikh Mr. de Bunsen, Abdur Bahman-bin-Faisal upon Nejd territory Telegraphic, with the connivance and assistance of Mubarak, October 3. tire movement being supported on the north by Sadtm Pasha, a Turkish subject, Chief of the Montefik Bedouins. At the first news of disturbances it was at once proposed to send Colonel Kemball to Koweit c&lt; to counsel Mubarak to avoid giving the Turks an excuse for interference,” and as the Agree- November 14. ment of 1899 had promised the good offices of Her Majesty’s Government the Resident was also to be instructed “ to endeavour to warn the the Amir that no attack on Koweit would be permitted.” Preliminary measures were to be taken to protect the Sheikh, but no force was to be landed without reference to the home authorities. Shortly afterwards, however, reports were received that the crisis was over, and at Colonel Kemball’s own request his visit was postponed. It appeared that Mubarak was able to hold his India Office, own, and the presence of a ship of war would December 10 - give him undue encouragement. A despatch from the Consul at Bussorah Mr. Wratislaw, summed up the situation. A conflict had been ^°' V g^’ ber 22 averted, though at the cost of a considerable increase of Turkish prestige. The Yali, Mohsin Pasha, having prevailed upon both sides to keep the peace, had induced Mubarak to accompany him to Bussorah, there to make solemn profes sions of allegiance to the Sultan, and to promise to cease “ coquetting with foreign Powers.” Mr. Lyle, in The result seemed to an independent observer M ; lckeHZie ’ s likely to “prove a considerable blow to any her 23, i!H)o. pretensions of Mubarak to being an independent Sheikh.” A declaration of some importance was made about this time with regard to the status of11 No. 59, February It), Sir N. O’Conor, No. 11, Telegraphic. Koweit. An Arab native of Koweit, concerned in a case of smuggling arms, had been claimed as a Turkish subject. The Resident was informed by the Foreign Office, in answer to his inquiry whether he should contest the claim, that— “ although Her Majesty’s Government had promised their good offices to the Sheikh of Koweit, the district has never been formally placed under British protection. Her Majesty’s Government cannot, therefore, claim natives of Koweit as British-protected persons.” Late in December Mubarak was reported to be making fresh preparations for an attack on Nejd, and the second phase of the quarrel begins. In February Sir N. O’Conor expressed his opinion on the general situation. An outbreak of hostilities, his Excellency observed, would scarcely fail to bring the Turks again into the field. “Her Majesty’s Government may thus be placed in a difficult position, and be forced either to raise an unpleasant question with the Ottoman Government, or to assert effective control over KoWeit, or else sacrifice the privileged position acquired by the Con vention of January 1899. It is hardly to be expected that the Sheikh of Koweit will respect an Agreement from which he derives no security and little material advantage.” His Excellency was strongly averse to doing anything which would “ encourage the Sultan’s anxiety in regard to British policy in the Persian Gulf,” and he suggested that the Amir of Aejd should be approached through his Bussorah Agent, while the Porte might be informed that Colonel Kembali would use every effort to restrain the Sheikh. On the 28th February the Viceroy telegraphed that the Resident’s advice had been already tendered to Mubarak (though, as afterwards appeared, not personally but through the news agent) and refused. The proposed visit, there fore, did not seem likely to have any result, while “ a second failure might even be em barrassing.” As in November hostilities were allowed to begin without any formal remonstrance on the part of the British authorities. On the 29th March the complete defeat of the Koweit forces was reported, and it was rumoured that the Sheikh had been killed in12 action. If the report was true it was obvious that Mubarak’s death would seriously endanger the Agreement of 1899, and a ship of Avar was placed under orders. Colonel Kemball visited Koweit (April 18). He found the Sheikh alive, hut was satisfied that he had been severely defeated. Nothing was said to the Amir. Mohsin Pasha had remained comparatively inactive since his diplomatic success of Novem ber, hut the defeat of Mubarak now brought on Turkish interference in a more acute form. A Turkish Pield-Marshal left Bagdad for Bussorah on the 19th April, followed on the next day by Turkish troops. It was generally believed that the Ottoman Government intended to make use of force AA’ith a view to the deposition of Mubarak. A British gun-boat was ordered to Koweit, and Sir N. O’Conor was definitely authorized, in the event of hostilities being resumed, to warn, the Porte “to refrain from any action against the Sheikh in view of our arrangement with him.” But the astute policy of Mohsin Pasha again prevented matters from coming to a head. The Turkish Pield-Marshal stopped short of KoAveit, and the Yali himself, with a small escort, paid a friendly visit to the Sheikh. He was unable to enforce proposals for the establishment of a Turkish garrison, but Mubarak accompanied him Mr. Wratislaw, to Pao, renewed his protestations to the Sultan, No ‘ 30, June 1 ‘ and returned to Koweit after a second act of apparently spontaneous loyalty.* On the 28th May the Amir of Nejd appealed for British protection, hut, after consultation with the Viceroy, the India Office expressed the opinion, in which the Poreign Office concurred, that it was not advisable to— “ incur the difficulties and embarrassments which must India Office, ensue from the declaration of a Protectorate over J une 14. either the territories of the Chiefs of Koweit and Nejd.” The Viceroy, however, pointed out that some answer must he given to the Chiefs, and Colonel Kemhall again visited Koweit Avith general in structions to find some modus vivendi between the * Molisin Pasha has since been dismissed (Sir N.

Slieikh and the Amir, while maintaining our hold upon the Sheikh. Early in August he saw Mubarak, who sug gested the Sheikh of Mohammerah as intermediary, and Mr. Wratislaw was subsequently authorized to assist communication between the latter and the agent of the Amir. But renewed rumours of Turkish concen tration again raised the larger diplomatic ques tion. In July Sir E. Lascelles had had a conversa tion with Dr. Bosen, of the German Eorei&lt;?n Office, upon the prospects of the Anatolian Railway and the general situation. An expression used by his Excellency describ ing the Sheikh as technically a subject of the Sultan but enjoying a considerable amount of independence ” which on a previous occasion had passed without comment (see Sir E. Lascelles’ No. 156 of the 15th June, 1900), now drew from the German Representative an assertion that the Sheikh was “ merely a subject of the Sultan.” To Sir F. Lascelles, No. 128, Telegraphic, August 10. To Sir N. O’Conor, No. 103, Telegraphic, August 10. It was therefore pointed out to Sir E. Lascelles that the German Government might take advan tage of his language to argue that the Sultan could dispose of the territory of the Sheikh. The view that the Sheikh was simply a subject of the Sultan was one that Her Majesty’s Government were totally unable to accept, and his Excellency was instructed to use language on the lines of Sir N. O’Conor’s despatch No. 130 of the 10th April, 1900 (see p. 8). Sir N. O’Conor was at the same time authorized to state, if occasion arose, that if Koweit were threatened, Her Majesty’s Government would use force to prevent attack. Important communications now took place at London and Constantinople. Considerable pressure was being exercised on Telegram* the Ottoman Government by the German and ;jyfos 92 93 ^ August 21. ’ Russian Embassies, and though a proposal of the Yali of Bussorah to use force against the Sheikh had been rejected by the Council of Ministers, Tewfik Pasha informed Sir N. O’Conor that Koweit was regarded as an integral part of the Ottoman Empire. A warning given by the Commander of the “ Perseus ” to the Captain of a Turkish corvette off Koweit that no troops would be permitted to [929] E14 land was largely magnified in transmission, and occasioned further protests. Tewfik Pasha inquired on the 29th August Telegram No. 102. whether Her Majesty’s Government intended to establish a Protectorate, and on the same day the To SirF.Laseeiies, German Embassy in [London received a pressing instruction to state that a British Protectorate would be contrary to the Treaty of Berlin, and that in view of her interest in Koweit as the future terminus of the Anatolian [Railway, Germany would he compelled to regard sucn a proceeding as an unfriendly act. The reply in each case was that His Majesty s Government had no such intention, Sir A. 0 Conor adding the reservation “ provided that Turkey did not force our hands by interfering with the Sheikh.” On the 3rd September Count Metternich called to say “that if by threats of force His Majesty’s Government prevented the Sultan from landing troops at Koweit, they were refusing to recognize tiie Sultan’s authority with which they had stated (in a Memorandum communicated by the King to the German Emperor, see p. 15) that they did not desire to interfere in those parts, and that the German Government con sidered that Koweit formed unquestionably part of the territories belonging to the Sultan.” Sir T. Sanderson promised to report his obser vations to Lord Lansdowne, and said he could at once state that His Majesty’s Government had no desire to disturb the status quo. Next day telegrams were communicated by the Turkish Ambassador protesting against the re ported intention to declare a British Protectorate and describing the Convention of 1899 as without validity, but the Sultan had meanwhile been advised by the German Government to be satis fied with the assurances given to Count Metter nich, and to ask for their repetition. On the 6th September Sir N. O’Conor was sent for by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The assurances given by his Excellency on this occasion were considered by the Ottoman Government “ of a nature to terminate the present controversy,” and Anthopoulo Pasha was instructed to ask for their confirmation. The following note was accordingly addressed to him :—15 “ Hie Marquess of Lansdowne to AntJiopoulo Pasha, “Foreign Office, “ Your Excellency, September 11 , 1901. “ I HAVE taken note with satisfaction of the telegram from the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, com municated by you on the 9th instant, in which his Excellency states that the Turkish Government will not send troops to Koweit, and will maintain the status quo there, on condition that His Majesty’s Government will abstain from occupying that place or establishing a British Protectorate there. “ I have pleasure in confirming the assurance which has been given to his Excellency by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that, provided the Turkish Government abstain from sending troops to Koweit and respect the status quo there, His Majesty’s Government will not occupy that place or establish a British Protectorate over it. “ I am, &amp;c. (Signed) “LANSDOWNE.”' In a Secret telegram dated the 7th September, Lord Lansdowne, while pointing out that “ the situation requires very careful handling as our arrangement with the Sheikh is not very precise, and it was entered into without the knowledge or concurrence of the Porte,” instructed Sir N. O’Conor that “we cannot recede from our posi tion, and if Porte should insist on raising question of their rights we may have to con vert into something much more precise the present indefinite Understanding with the Sheikh.” In view, however, of the assurances recorded in the note quoted above, his Excellency has not found occasion to communicate these instructions, and the controversy with the Porte rests for the moment on the basis of a mutual maintenance of the status quo. The Turkish Ambassador has expressed, himself well satisfied with the present state of affairs (October 1), and on the same day Sir IV. O’Conor was assured by the Minister for Foreign Affairs “ most positively that the Im perial Government had no intention whatsoever of occupying or attacking Koweit.” There is an understanding that the two Governments are to co-operate in maintaining the peace, Turkey endeavouring to restrain the Amir, while Her Majesty’s Government Avill do what they can to discourage the Sheikh from aggressive action. Mubarak has been told that the good offices of16 Her Majesty’s Government will be extended to him only if he follows their advice. On the 9th September a further communication was made to Count Metternich. A Memorandum upon various subjects, includ- ToSirF.Lascelles, , £ Nos. 304 and 312, ing Koweit, drawn up by Lord Lansdowne tor September 11 and the King’s personal use, and handed by His 12 - Majesty to the German Emperor at their recent meeting, had elicited a formal reply from the German Government which Count Metternich had left at the Eoreign Office on the 3rd. It was now explained to him that the Memo randum, which had been hastily prepared, was a purely informal and unofficial document. The statement referred to by Count Metternich on the 3rd was a repetition of Sir N. O’Conor’s language in 1900 which might be more correctly described as having stated that His Majesty’s Government have no desire to interfere with the Sultan’s authority as it exists in those parts. There could be no doubt that this authority was of a very limited description. The Sbeikh be longed to a class of native Chiefs enjoying a large measure of practical independence with whom His Majesty’s Government found it necessary to have direct relations for the sake of the main tenance of tranquillity and the protection of Eritish trade. Therefore, although ready to maintain the status quo, His Majesty’s Government had been unable to acquiesce in attempts recently made by Turkey to impose on the Sheikh conditions from which he had hitherto been free. They had considered it a matter for direct and friendly discussion with the Porte, who now regarded the incident as closed, and Count Metternich was informed of the assurances exchanged. Lord Lansdowne on his return to London said To Sir F. Lascelles, to Count Metternich. that it was necessary to g^g^er 28 bear in mind that where minor Eastern States were concerned it was not unusual to find that they owed a divided allegiance to more than one Power. The German Memorandum states that Koweit has an importance for Germany merely as the proposed terminus of the Bagdad Bailway and gives an undertaking that the Manager of the Bailway Company will be instructed to come to an understanding with the British Government when the time for purchasing land for a railway terminus and a landing-place at Koweit shallIf c&gt;cag) 17 have come. Count Metternicli has since con- To Sir F. Lascelles, firmed this assurance in conversation with Lord No. 3S7, October 16. Lansdowne, adding that the railway might be made five years or fifty years hence, or not at all, but that when it was made it was important for Germany to find a peaceful condition of things in that part of the Gulf. Defences of Koweit. With regard to the military defences of Koweit the following reports have heen received since the statement of Admiral Douglas in February 1899 that the navy alone could afford effective protec tion :— Commander-in-chief, East Indies, to Admiralty. — {Com municated by Admiralty, August 31.)

Wells are situated 3 miles outside town, which is thus rendered equally untenable for either side. Use of Turkish flag in Koweit. The declarations repeatedly made by His Majesty’s Government of non-interference with existing Turkish authority have involved some controversy with regard to the use by the Sheikh of the Turkish flag to which British officers in the Gulf are strongly averse. Mubarak has constantly flown the Turkish flag not only on his dhow while in the company of the Yali of Bussorah, but also at his house on the occasion of the British Besident’s visit. When asked the reason of this he replied that [929] E18 “ it was flown by his father and grandfather on such occasions as a Mahommedan flag and did not indicate that they were under any control or protection of the Turks.” On the 19th August the India Office forwarded a suggestion of the Resident that the use of the flag should be discontinued on the ground that it was inconsistent to allow the Turkish flag to be flown while Turkish troops were forbidden to land. The Foreign Office inquired what flag it was proposed that the Sheikh should fly, but it was pointed out that Lord Lansdowne was not pre pared to support any action which might seem inconsistent with the assurance given by Sir N. O’Conor that His Majesty’s Government would respect the status quo. The Resident has replied recommending the use of the ordinary red Arab flag, and intimating that the events of the past two-and-a-half years have so disturbed the status quo that a determi nation of the status of Kov r eit cannot be much longer postponed. The India Office made no comment on the suggestion, but it has been thought advisable to point out that the Sheikh has accepted the post of Kaimakam, that he holds property in Turkish territory, that the Turkish flag has been flown since 1871, and that Lord Lansdowne does not consider that there is anything in the events of the last two-and-a-half years to justify a depar ture from the status quo upon the maintenance of which His Majesty’s Government have always laid the greatest stress.

In July 1900 an attempt was made to establish a weekly call at Koweit of the British India Company’s steamers. Mr. Lyle, an agent of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Co., of Bussorah, was well received by the Sheikh, w r ho made, however, the important stipulation that the call of steamers should not bring with it the establishment of quarantine. The Turkish authorities who were paying much attention to Koweit w r ould almost office^Septem-^ certainly enforce at that place, as at Bussorah, a ber 5, 1900. ten days’ quarantine against arrivals from all ports other than Turkish.

Lieutenant-Colonel of call for\ See p. 5. 19 out that in the event of Her Majesty’s Govern ment making successful representations to the Porte against a quarantine for Kovveit the Sheikh would be subjected to a general system of reprisals and his town treated as a foreign port (a similar difficulty having already presented itself in connection with the Sheikh’s property in Turkish territory). The question was solved for the moment by the Sheikh withdrawing his consent to the scheme. The withdrawal was not, however, conveyed in very decided terms, the compulsion of extraneous influence was apparent, and it seemed to Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball that his objections would he removed at a future date. In June 1901 the Sheikh intimated that he was now favourable to the scheme. It was accordingly arranged that the mail-steamers should call at Koweit on the upward vovage from Bombay to Bussorah. The quarantine officials at first imposed certain restrictions, hut their objections were not of as serious a character as had been anticipated, and they were not maintained. Viewed solely from the com mercial point of view the enterprise does not seem likely to be lucrative, hut it is hoped that when the state of the country is less disturbed there will he a remunerative export of horses from Nejd through Koweit.

Historical. —Koweit (or Crane) is a large town of some 20..000 to 25,000 inhabitants (one authority, M. Stavrides, puts the population at 50,000), situated on the north-west shore of one of the best harbours in the Persian Gulf. It has for long been regarded as the possible terminus of a projected Euphrates Yalley Railway. When in 1871 a Turkish force was sent to the assistance of Abdullah bin Eeysul, Amir of Nejd, against his brother—an expedition which was under taken in spite of representations by Her Majesty’s Government, and which resulted m the establishment of Turkish suzerainty in El Hasa and Ivatif the Koweit Sheikh was an active ally of the Turks, who subsequently, accordino- to Colonel Telly’s report, established a custom house at Koweit. The suzerainty of the Sultan over the portion of the littoral of the Persian Gulf north of Ojair (a place opposite the island of Demam, just south of Katif) has never been formally acknowledged by Her Majesty’s Government. There are indications, however, that the British Government would have been ready to welcome Turkish authority on that part of the coast if effectually exerted in the interests of order. Tenacious, however, as they have shown themselves of their shadowy rights, the Turks have done nothing towards establishing their authority in any part of the western sea board of the Turkish Gulf; and have confined themselves to the location of small garrisons at Katif, and at El Bidaa (where the British Government has declined to recognise their authority), and to the grant of the titles of Kaimakam and Mutessarif to certain local chiefs. 1896. Attention was prominently drawn to Koweit in 1898 by a memorandum written by M. Stavrides, Legal Adviser to the British Embassy at Constan tinople, who represented that much excitement had been caused in the Sultan’s entourage by a report that Mubarak, a son of the late Sheikh of Koweit, had at the instigation of the British Resident* murdered his brother and usurped the chiefship. M. Stavrides described Koweit as an independent Arab State, but stated that, owing to the possession by the ruling family of landed property near Busrah, the Sultan had usually accorded his sanction to the succession of each Chief to the throne, and granted to him the title of Kaimakam. A visit of H.M.S. “ Sphinx” to Koweit in July 1896 con firmed the report of Mubarak’s usurpation. Commander Baker reported that Koweit, though nominally independent, was in reality greatly under Turkish influence, more especially since Mubarak’s accession, and that the Turkish flag was flying there. In December 1896 the Consul at Busrah reported that he was satisfied that Koweit subjects were concerned in a piratical attack on the British dhow “Haripasa.” It was at first proposed, and the Indian Government were inclined to favour the proposal, to hold the Turkish and Persian Governments responsible—a proposal which would, m the circumstances, ha\e involved a recognition of Turkish authority over Koweit; but it was eventually decided not to adopt this method of procedure on the ground of the improbability that any satisfaction would be obtained by it. 1897 . The Sheikh of Koweit was eventually seriously warned by the Resident that he would be held responsible for the misconduct of his subjects. In February 1897 a proposal was made by the Constantinople Sanitary Board to establish a Turkish quarantine station at Koweit. The Government of India had no objection, but nothing appears to have been done to carry out the proposal efiectively, though a so-called sanitary authority is stationed ■there.f * This was of course absolutely denied by the Resident.

On the 27th February the Government of India reported that Mubarak was. making overtures for an interview with the Resident, and permission was given for the interview to take place. Colonel Meade reported the result of the interviev/ in his letter of the 25th September 1897. It appeared that the Sheikh wished to place himself under British protection such as was enjoyed by Bahrein. He had previously endeavoured to secure recognition from the Turks, and it was doubtful whether his advances to us were bond fide or designed to put pressure on the Turks. On the whole, Colonel Meade was in favour of meeting the Sheikh’s wishes, but recognised that difficulties would arise from Turkish claims. In the meantime Captain Whyte, lately Consul at Busrah, had sent in a memorandum showing strong reasons against M. Stavrides’ assertion that Koweit Avas independent of Turkey. The Foreign Office had accordingly instructed Sir IST. O’Conor (with reference to a proposal that the British Consul should intervene in consequence of an attack which had been made on Koweit by Sheikhs Jassim of Katr and Yusuf Ibrahim) that, though we had never acknowledged .Koweit to be under Turkish protection, it seemed doubtful whether we could deny that in fact it was under Turkish influence. The Consul was accordingly instructed not to intervene unless the peace of the Gulf was threatened. This attitude was consistently maintained by Her Majesty’s Government^ notwithstanding rumours that the Turks intended to intervene and that a son of the murdered Sheikh had invoked British assistance and protection, and a representation by the Government of India that, whereas Koweit was at present a dangerous piratical centre and emporium for the slave trade, Sheikh Mubarak was anxious to accept our protection. The receipt of Colonel Meade’s report, and of a letter from the Admiral on the East India Station advocating the strengthening of our hold over Koweit, did not affect the attitude of Her Majesty’s Government, though it was laid down that there was nothing in the status of Koweit to hamper naval officers in bringing home to the Sheikh responsibility for piratical acts committed by his subjects (telegram to India, dated 4th December 1897). 1898. Late in 1897 and early in 1898 reports were received of movements of Turkish troops near Busrah, of an alleged Russian mission to Baghdad, and of an intention on the part of Russia to acquire a coaling station on the Persian Gulf, possibly Koweit. These reports induced the India Office to- ask the Foreign Office (11th February 1898) whether they were in possession of any information as to designs of Foreign Powers, which might make it desirable to modify the policy of non-intervention in Koweit. To this letter no reply was received till the 5th December 1898. In the interval Mr. (now Lord) Curzon had been inquiring into the subject, but officially the question had been allowed to rest; and nothing had occurred to bring it again into prominence until the receipt of Sir N. O’Conor’s Despatch of the 1st November 1898, which enclosed a Consular Report to the effect that the Yali of Busrah, by sanction of the Porte, had appointed a commis sion to settle the quarrels between Sheikh Mubarak and his nephews. The India Office then addressed a letter to the Foreign Office (dated 23rd November 1898) drawing attention to the issues raised in the letter of the 11th February. The Foreign Office in reply expressed their readiness to support the Government of India by diplomatic action, should that Government consider that a protectorate over Koweit might be asserted and undertaken by it on its sole responsibility without difficulty or inconvenient extension of police duties in the Gulf. It was added “ It does not appear that there is any foundation in fact for a Turkish claim of sovereignty or control over the district.” The substance of this letter was communicated to the G overnment of India, with a request for their views, by telegram, on the 24th December 1898. On the 27th December 1898 the Foreign Office received from Sir N. O’Conor a Despatch (dated 22nd December) pointing out the necessity for caution and the avoidance of any overt act, which would probably be regarded by Turkey as 1 sllort of a hostile act and provoke serious complications not only with lurkey but with Russia. J The substance of this warning was telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 5th January 1899.[In 1896 Sir P. Currie had reported that the Russian Embassy in Constantinople had been using very strong language at the Porte regarding England’s grasping policy vis a vis to Turkey, whether in Cyprus, Egypt, or the Persian Gulf.] 1899. About this time came news that Count Kapnist’s application for a concession to build a railway from Tripoli to Koweit was likely to prove successful; and, in order to take precautions against any territorial claims which Russia might possibly base upon that concession, it was decided (without waiting for the reply of the Government of India to the telegram of the 24th December) at the instance of the Foreign Odice (letter 4th January 1899) to instruct the Viceroy to procure an engagement from the Sheikh “ not to cede, lease, mortgage, or otherwise alienate or give for occupation “ any portion of his territories to the Government or subjects of any other “ Power without previously obtaining the consent of Her Majesty’s Govern- “ ment.’’ The consideration was to be a sum of 5,000/-. to be advanced by India, the question of the ultimate incidence of the charge being reserved (telegram to Viceroy, dated 6th January 1899). The Viceroy reported that he had instructed rhe Resident accordingly (telegram, 9th January 1899) ; and added “ Proposed negotiations, if successful, seem to involve ultimate protectorate.” After some discussion as to the form of the engagement, the Government of India were finally instructed (telegram, 17th January 1899) to adopt as a model the Muscat Agreement of 20th March 1891, and Colonel Meade was authorised to promise an annual subsidy of Rs. 3,000, if he considered it desirable, instead of a lump sum of 5,000/. as originally proposed. Colonel Meade reported his procedings in his letter of the 30th January 1899 (Enclosure in India Secret Letter, No. 7, 23rd February 1899). He met Sheikh Mubarak on the 23rd January, and showed him the draft agree ment,* in which (in excess of the Government of India’s instructions) a clause had been inserted binding the Sheikh not to receive the representatives of Foreign Powers. Before signing a document which might get him into trouble with Turkey, the Sheikh asked for some assurance of British pro tection and assistance, especially in regard to the family property situated in Turkish territory. Colonel Meade promised him a letter assuring him of “the good offices of Her Majesty’s Government” so long as he and his successors observed the conditions of the bond, and promising him a sum of Rs. 15,000. On receipt of this letter, the Sheikh signed the agreement. His brothers, however, refused to sign in the absence of a distinct undertaking that Her Majesty’s Government would protect the family estates. The conclusion of the Agreement was notified in the Viceroy’s telegram of the 30th January, and its terms were communicated in his further telegram of the 12th February. This latter telegram asked (1) whether, with a view to conciliate the Sheikh’s brothers, Colonel Meade should be instructed to give an assurance that their “ interests in regard to the Turkish estates will be looked after and receive consideration of Her Majesty’s Government;” (2) whether the Agreement should be ratified. The Foreign Office (14th February) agreed to Colonel Meade “ holding out a hope that Her Majesty’s “ Government will do what they can to protect the family estates of the Sheikh “ of Koweit at Fao,” and considered that the Agreement should be ratified. This decision was communicated to the Viceroy by telegraph on the 14th February. The Government of India were informed by Despatch of the 30th March 1899 that Colonel Meade’s action was approved; but it was observed that he had not been authorised to insert a proviso about the representatives of other Powers. As this proviso had been introduced, it might remain in force; but its operation, especially with reference to the Sheikh’s relations with the Turkish Government, would require careful attention. Meanwhile, on the 3rd February, the Government of India, having learned that there was a possibility of armed interference by the Turks, asked for permission to instruct the naval authorities to forbid it. This was granted; and the Admiral reported that, if time were given to collect ships, Koweit Kapnist concession. Political, 1657 nn 151/99. 155/99. 319,99.

(Political, 2292/99.) would be defensible by the Navy alone. Arrangements were made that Her Majesty's Government should have the earliest possible notice, in the event of preparatory measures being found necessary, in order to give a serious warning to Turkey before forcible measures were actually taken. It was also decided, contrary to the view of the Government of India, that the Admiral should take no steps to prevent Turkish transports leaving the Shat-ul-Arab without orders from the Admiralty, which would only be issued when the occasion arose. During the month of February further reports were received of visits of Russians to Koweit. Consular reports from Busrah also made it clear that the suspicions of the Turks had been excited by Colonel Meade s visit. A formal complaint was made by the Constantinople Board of Health that Colonel Meade had landed by force in defiance of sanitary regulations; the Nakib of Busrah proceeded to Koweit ostensibly on private business; Mubarak was reported to be distrusted ; and it appeared probable that the Yali of Busrah, might espouse the cause of Mubarak's nephews. Sir N. O’Conor considered that it might be desirable to warn the Porte that Her Majesty’s Government would view with displeasure any expedition against Mubarak; but further reports induced him to modify his opinion ('No. 292, dated 6th June), and it was decided merely to authorise the Consul at Busrah to warn the Yaii (to Sir IS 7 . O’Conor, dated 17th June), and to enjoin on the Sheikh of Koweit caution in his language (telegram to Yiceroy, dated 20th June 1899). Meanwhile the Government of India (No. 101, dated 1st June) had supported a suggestion of Colonel Meade, that diplomatic action should be taken with a view to an early understanding with the Porte in respect to the status of Koweit, in order to prevent local complications. Colonel Meade’s letter of the 14th May (Enclosure 5) reported an allegation that the Turks were inciting other Arab Sheikhs, especially the Sheikh of Nejd, to attack Koweit, so as to give them an excuse for interference. Further reports received from the Consul at Busrah induced Sir N. O'Conor (No. 328, dated 5th July 1899) to think it possible that the Sultan might himself broach the subject of Koweit; and he suggested, that in that case, while avoiding as far as possible a definite statement respecting the independence of Koweit, he might say that it would be a satisfactory arrangement for both England and Turkey if the Sultan would agree not to cede any of his rights in those parts to other Powers. This proposal was approved, subject to a limitation proposed by the India Office (18th July 1899) that nothing should be said which might hamper us in giving effect to our obligations under the Koweit Agreement (to Sir N. O’Conor, dated 25th July 1899). Before, however, this permission could be acted upon, reports were received from the Consul at Busrah, that the Turks had appointed a harbour master to Koweit; that the Sheikh had declined to receive him; that a renewed attempt to appoint a native of Koweit as harbour master had been ordered from Constantinople; and that the Turkish military authorities were advocating strong measures. It was also rumoured that the Turks proposed to establish a custom house at Koweit. The India Office (7th September 1899) in view of the embarrassment whifch might be caused by acquiescence in such an exercise of the rights of sovereignty by the Porte, recommended to the Foreign Office that the Turkish Government should be informed that Her Majesty’s Government had entered into engagements with the Sheikh of Koweit as an. independent ruler, and were not disposed to recognise any infringement of his iiidepenclence ; orrat least, that it should be intimated that the authority of no Turkish official at Koweit would be recognised. The Foreign Office thereupon instructed Sir N. O’Conor to warn the Porte at once that, while Her Majesty’s Government had them selves no designs on Koweit, they had friendly relations with the Sheikh ; and that a very inconvenient and disagreeable question would be raised if an attempt were made to establish Turkish authority or customs control at Koweit without previous agreement with Her Majesty’s Government. At the same time they requested the Admiralty to send a ship to Koweit to protect the Sheikh against overt acts of aggression by the Turkish authorities ; but, on receipt of a telegram from Sir N. O’Conor representing the inexpediency of1899 . 5 I this latter step in the existing circumstances, H.M.S. “ Sphinx ” was ordered merely to call at Koweit and proceed without making any stay. In his Despatch No. 440 of the 13th September 1899, Sir N. O’Conor reported that he had carried out his instructions, and had received an assurance from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that no further attempt would be made to insist upon the appointment of the harbour master; that the Ottoman Government had no intention of establishing a custom house at Koweit; and that the despatch of a military expedition was not in contem plation, as, though such an expedition had been proposed by the Yali, the Sultan did not consider it worth the risk or expense. In a Despatch written on the following day Sir N. O’Connor reported that it had been represented to him by Anthopoulo Pasha that the &gt;ultan was much disturbed by his (Sir ,N. 0.Conor’s language with regard to Koweit, which appeared to indicate a desire on the part of Her Majesty’s Government to interfere with Plis Majesty’s liberty of action in Turkish territory. Sir N. O’Conor replied that it would be better to leave no door open for mis understanding, and he repeated his language of the previous day, emphasising the points that Her Majesty’s Government had no aggressive intentions in those parts, and that it depended on the Ottoman Government not to raise an intricate and unpleasant question without necessity. He added that Her Majesty’s Government were in most friendly relations with the Sheikh of Koweit and could not pass without notice any hostile action taken against him ; but he avoided the direct issue of the territorial dependency of the Admiralty to Foreign Office, dated 14th Sept. 1899. Political, 2299/99. 2332-3/99. No. 442, dated 14th Sept. 1899. Sheikh. In a further Despatch Sir N. O’Conor reported that he had had a further conversation with Tewfik Pasha, in which he again impressed upon the Foreign Minister the desirability of not now raising a question about Koweit, reminding him that in 1883 Lord Granville had informed Rustem Pasha that the Turkish right of sovereignty over the El Katar Coast had never been admitted by Her Majesty’s Government. Tewfik Pasha agreed in considering it inexpedient to raise this awkward question. The language held by Sir N. O’Conor was approved by Her Majesty’s Government. In his Despatch No. 434 of the 13th September, Sir N. O’Conor reported the steps taken by the Consul at Busrah in fulfilment of the promise that Her Majesty’s Government would do what they could to protect the estates of the Koweit chiefs at Fao. Mr. Wratislaw had on the.26th July, in accordance with instructions conveyed to him by Sir N. O’Conor in July, expressed to the Yali a hope that an equitable settlement would scon be arrived at of the rival claims of Sheikh Mubarak and of the sons of the late Sheikh, it being a matter in regard to which Her Majesty’s Government were not indifferent. From the conversation which followed, it appeared that Mubarak had made totally inadequate proposals; and the Consul was of opinion that he had been treated by the Porte with “ surprising tenderness,” consideriug that he had declined to submit to the jurisdiction of the Turkish Courts, within which the estates in question undoubtedly lie, and had for three years appropriated the whole of the revenues. The Consul, notwith standing his instructions (see telegram to Sir N. O’Conor, dated 17th June), had not thought it opportune on this occasion to warn the Yali against taking hostile action against Mubarak till indications of the necessity of such a warning, which were not then apparent, should present themselves. The warning was subsequently delivered to the Yali on the 8th September 1899. Under the date of the 5th October (No. 474) Sir N. O’Conor reported that Sheikh Mubarak had unsuccessfully attempted to place himself under the protection of the Persian Government, and it appeared from a Despatch of the Consul at Busrah, subsequently (6th November) received, that the Sheikh had written to his friend, the British Agent at Bahrein, to the effect that he had no great confidence in British support, and that, knowing that the Tm’ks hostile to him, he had applied for Persian protection. Consul Wratislaw’s Despatch* of the 16th September 1899 indicated that Mubarak had then turned his attention to intrigues with the Nakib of Busrah and Mob sin Pasha, the military commander, against Hamdi Pasha, the Yali, which ultimately resulted in the dismissal of the latter, and the promotion of Mohsin to be Yali of Busrah.

This result appears, from Consul Wratislaw’s Despatch above referred to mo 46). to have been connected with a new development in the Koweit situation which was first reported by Sir N. O'Oonor in Ins telegram of the 5th January 1900, viz., that; a Commission (including the German Consul- General at Constantinople and the Chief Engineer of the Anatolian Eadway) in connection with the German scheme for a railway to Bagdad, which had i us t arrived at Busrah, intended to try for a concession ot a port at Koweit, and that it would start for Koweit in a few days with this view. _n a subsequent telegram* from Sir N. O’Conor it was reported that the German promoters appeared to intend to negotiate direct with the Forte, ignoring the Sheikh. A further report, however, was received through the Viceroy from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, who visited Koweit on the 13th January, to the effect that the Germans proposed to acquire three or four miles of land at Kathama Bay; that the Sheikh had been asked by Mohsin Pasha to befriend the German mission; and that Captain Denison had delivered to Sheikh Mubarak a message fiom the Resident, Persian Gulf (sent with the Viceroy’s permission!) to the effect that the Sheikh must inform him (the Resident) of any proposals made to him by the Germans and abide by the decision of the Government of India in the matter. To this message Mubarak had replied on the 21st January statinr lw ' woo nnnnr nrntnntirm anrl would do all that we desired. J5 that he was under our protection and would do all that we desired. Tip Sheikh’s account of his interview with the Commission, which took place on the 20th January, is given in Mr. Gaskin’s report of the 5th February. The Commission had stated that they held a concession from the Sultan, who was largely interested in the undertaking, to make a railway in Turkish territory, and that they desired to extend it to Kathama Bay, which they wished to buy, obtaining certain other lands on lease ; that their present visit was only preliminary in order to secure Mubarak’s co-operation and support with the Arab Sheikhs through whose territory the line would pass; that he would he handsomely paid for any land purchased or leased from him; that the trade and importance of Koweit would be greatly enhanced and that he would enjoy the protection of the German Government. Mubarak represented himself as having declared that he was territorially independent of the Sultan ; that the Arabs would not consent to alienate their land, and that he [j{ could not help the Germans with the Arab Chiefs. He said that the Com mission finally offered him presents, which he refused, and went away the same day promising further communications from the German Ambassador at Constantinople. The Germans, on the other hand, wrote to their friends at Busrah stating that they were well received by the Sheikh and would certainly take their line to Koweit. Meanwhile, on the 19th January, the Foreign Office had asked for Sir N. O’Conor’s opinion as to whether it would be preferable to warn the Porte against taking any decision in this matter without consulting Her Majesty’s Government, or to speak to his German colleague confidentially of our relations with Koweit. + Telegram Sir N. O’ConorJ was of opinion that the moment was not opportune for No. 24 , &amp; dated taking either of these courses. He suggested as a third course that a hint 22 nd Jan. should he conveyed privately by Sir E. Law to the concessionaires, that any 1900 . arrangement which would ignore British relations with Koweit would (Political, result in delaying the enterprise. This course was sanctioned by the Foreign. 1720/1900.) Qfp, ce j n tpeir telegram No. 27 of the 26th January. Nothing, however, came of it. On the 2nd March the Admiralty communicated to the Foreign Office 1856/1900 an ex * rac t fr° m a letter (dated 27th January) from the Senior Naval Officer ° ’ ' in the Persian Gulf, reporting the proceedings of the German Commission, and representing that it would be a great blow to our prestige in the Gulf were any other Power allowed to acquire the port of Koweit. 2048/1900. On the 12th March, in view of the visit of the Russian gunboat “ Gilyak,” with the Russian Consul at Bagdad on hoard, to Koweit, H.M.S. “ Sphinx” was ordered to proceed to Koweit and remain there for a few days. The “ Gilyak ” brought a present from the Russian Consul to the Sheikh.1900 . On the 20th March Sir N. O’Conor was authorised to inform the Turkish Political, Government and the German Ambassador how matters stood between the 18o6 / 190 °- British Government and the Sheikh. In his Despatch No. 130 of the 10th April, Sir N. O’Conor reported a 2027/1900. conversation he had had with Tewfik Pasha on the 9th April regarding the visit of the German Commission to Koweit, in which he again stated that Her Majesty’s Government would not regard with indifference any action which would alter the existing state of things or give to another Power special rights or privileges in Koweit. Tewfik Pasha evinced no desire to discuss the matter, and Sir Nicholas concluded that the Ottoman Government had already a fairly correct knowledge of our agreement with the Sheikh. On the same day Sir N. O’Conor informed the German Ambassador that Her Majesty’s Government had an agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit, which, wdiile leaving the status quo unimpaired, prevented the Sheikh from alienating his territories without the consent of the British (government. Baron von Marschall, who betrayed some dissatisfaction at this statement, said that he supposed such an agreement would not prevent the construction of the railway, hut that he was quite alive to the disadvantages of alienating British capital. Sir Nicholas replied that he thought there would he no difficulty in reconciling our interests with those of the Itailway Company, and referred to negotiations between the Anatolian Railway and the Euphrates, Tigris and British India Companies. Sir N. O’Conor’s action was approved in Lord Salisbury’s Despatch No. 89, of the 24th April. On the 21st April a report (dated 29th March 1900) was received from 2 056/1900. the Yice-Consul at Bahrein that the Anatolian Railway Company was already making preparations for the construction of a pier at Koweit, and this report received some confirmation from a naval report, dated 26th March, 2123 / 1900 . to the effect that the Sheikh had stated that the Germans had been 2048 1900 . surveying. Sir N. O’Conor was not prepared to address the Porte upon these rumours, 2 o56/1900. which he considered improbable, but he suggested the appointment of a British secret agent at Koweit to keep a watch upon the Sheikh and secure his fidelity. The rumours were ultimately reported not to have been 592 / 1900 . confirmed. (Viceroy’s telegram, 7th June.) The reports, however, of German activity were such as to cause special instructions to be proposed for ‘the guidance of Her Majesty’s ships in the event of collisions between 2123 / 1900 . the Germans and the Arabs. ■With regard to the proposal to send a secret agent to Koweit, the India India office Office were of opinion that, before this step should be taken, it would be to Foreign advisable to decide what attitude Her Majesty’s Government should adopt in Office, dated s-y, •it/ # # # T\/l I-* case the Turkish and German Governments combined in pressing tor the cession of a site forth© railway terminus at Koweit. They further suggested that it would be well to explain the position more precisely to the Porte and to consider whether some arrangement might not be arrived at with the German Government, under which the construction of the railway works at Koweit might be permitted, subject to a full reservation of the political position acquired by Her Majesty’s Government under the agreement. The proposal to send a secret agent was then dropped. At the end of May a proposal was made on behalf of the British India Steam Navigation Company that a weekly service of steamers to Koweit should be arranged. The I'oreign Office approved ; and on the 3rd July Mr. Lyle, a re presentative of the Company, proceeded to Koweit, and had an interview with the Sheikh, who agreed to the scheme, provided no quarantine difficulties were ^ involved. However, in the middle of August the Sheikh wrote to Mr. Lyle O’Conor, notifying his withdrawal from the scheme, probably owing to pressure put No. 291, upon him by Sved Ahmed, an influential member of the family of the Nakib dated 15th a _ i 1 Aug. 1900. ot Busrah. In the meantime a move of importance had been made at Berlin, when on (Political, the 15th June Sir E. Lascelles had mentioned the Koweit question to Count 232 4 iy()0 ) Bulow (much in the same terms as Sir N. O’Conor had done to Baron 2214/1900. Marschall but admitting the “technical” supremacy of the Porte), and had requested that Her Majesty’s Government might be furnished with early information if the idea of the Koweit terminus was to be entertained.

Bulow stated that no decision was probable for some time, but telegraphed to Baron Marschall to inform him of Sir F. Lascelles’ wishes. Sir E. Lascelles’' action was approved (No. 126, dated 22nd June). On the 18th June Sir N. O’Conor forwarded an extract from the report of the German Commission, which was in favour of the selection of Kathama Bay as a terminus. The report showed the impression left upon die minds of the Commissioners as to the status of the Sheikh. On the one hand, they stated that he had taken such an independent attitude that there could be no- question of Ottoman authority in the district. On the other, they said that Kathama Bay was undoubtedly Turkish territory, and that “it would not be difficult for the Turks to establish their sovereign rights.” They had seen no- sign of the Sheikh intending to place himself under the protection of a foreign Power, as had been rumoured. Under the new regime (that of Mohsin Pasha) at Busrah, Mubarak’s relations with the Turks improved. In Jane it was reported that he had been created a Pasha and had received a decoration from the Sultan, and the various projects which had been set on foot by Hamdi Pasha for establishing Turkish authority at Koweit, and which were so distasteful to Mubarak, had been dropped. Further, his promised visit to Busrah was not for the time insisted upon. It may be mentioned incidentally that the Resident reported early in May (telegram to India dated 10th May) a probability that certain arms which had been confiscated by the Chief of Bahrein, and which were about to be restored to Messrs. Fracis Times &amp; Co., would be disposed of at Koweit. The Resident was authorised to negotiate an agreement with Sheikh Mubarak to absolutely prohibit all importation and exportation of arms at Koweit. This agreement was readily accepted by the Sheikh on the 24th May, and he issued on the same day notifications to carry it out. Her Majesty’s. Government approved of these proceedings on the understanding that without special instructions no effect should be given to the powers granted to British ships by the Sheikh to search vessels in Koweit waters. Early in October a report wus received that raids had been made on Nejd territory by Sheikh Abdur Rahman bin Faisal, a member of the Sand dynasty of Riadh, which had been ousted in 1886 by its vassal, Mohammed bin Rashid, Sheikh of the Jebel Shammer tribe. Mohammed bin Rashid had established himself as de facto ruler of Nejd, and had been succeeded by his nephew Abdul Aziz bin Rashid in December 1897. On the 8th October 1900 the Viceroy reported that fighting seemed probable in the neighbourhood of Koweit, and proposed to send Colonel Kemball to|Koweit to report and to warn the Sheikh against action likely to cause interference by the Turks. Her Majesty’s Government approved ; and from Colonel Kemball’s report (dated 3rd November and received 10th December 1900) it appeared that Mubarak was absent from Koweit when he arrived, and that his son came off to meet Colonel Kemball in a boat flying the Turkish flag. Colonel Kemball was, therefore, unable to deliver the proposed warning, but he gleaned the following information. Abdur Rahman bin Faisal liad°been for some years (since 1891) living at Koweit under Mubarak’s protection. On the other hand Sheikh Abdul Aziz of Nejd had espoused the cause of Mubarak’s enemy, Yusuf bin Ibrahim, and of the sons of Mubarak’s murdered brothers. TV hen, therefore, Abdur Rahman appealed to Mubarak for assistance, the latter ordered the Bedouin tribes subject to Koweit to suppoit Abdur Rahman in his raids upon Nejd from the East. Simultaneously Sadun Pasha, a Turkish subject and chief of the Montefik Bedouins, had raided ISejd from the north, whether at Mubarak’s instigation, or not, it was not clear. A Despatch* from Consul Shipley carried the story somewhat further. It appeared that the Emir of Nejd with a large force appeared within tw r o and a half days inarch of Busrah and demanded satisfaction for Sadun Pasha s raid.. To this the Vali agreed, and the Emir retired, but his future intentions with regard to the Koweit raid were left in doubt. The main facts of Consul Shipley’s report were telegraphed by Mr. de Bunsen on the 1st November, with a recommendation that a gunboat should go to Koweit to watch events.. A previous telegramf from Consul Shipley had reported matters at Koweit to be quiet and hostilities suspended ; and a subsequent message (dated 2nd November) from Mr. de Bunsen withdrew his recom-1900 . 9 mendation on the ground that the situation had improved, and that the Emir had promised to remain quiet pending settlement of his claims by an Political, Imperial Commissioner. On the 9th November, therefore, the India Office 249o / 190 °- recommended to the Eoreign Office that no further action should be taken 2487/1900. for the present; but, a less reassuring account of the state of affairs having been received from the Admiralty on the following day (10th November) the India Office again addressed the Eoreign Office (14th November) suggesting that a British Agent should be sent in a ship of war to ascertain the 2517 / 1900 . true state of affairs and to endeavour to warn the Emir of Nejd that no attack on Koweit would be allowed. It was further suggested that should it prove 1213/1900. impossible to resist a land attack with the force available at the moment, the Sheikh should be offered a refuge and steps taken as soon as possible to repulse the invaders. Eurther news was received on the same day that an attack on Koweit by the Emir of Nejd was considered improbable, but 2528/1900. possible ; and that the Turks were reinforcing their garrison at Busrah. The * Dated Eoreign Office* agreed to the despatch of a gunboat, but added that no i 4t!l ^ov. active measures should be taken without further reference to Her Majesty’s 1900 ' Government. The Government of India were then instructed accordingly, YirtP’ and it was suggested that Colonel Kemball should again proceed to Koweit. Yoo On the 15th November a telegram (dated 14th November) from Consul p oljtica j Shipley was forwarded by Mr. de Bunsen reporting that Mubarak’s forces (2529 1900 .) had joined those of Sadun Pasha, and that the Turks were sending a force 2618/1900. to intervene and compel the combatants to return home. On the 16th November, the Admiral reported that he had taken steps to 2538/1900. strengthen the naval force available in the neighbourhood of Koweit. On the same day (in a telegram received from Constantinople, 17th), Consul Shipley reported that the crisis was over, both forces being on their 2543/1900 way home; and that Mubarak was to meet the Yali about 30 miles from Busrah on the following day, this being regarded as his promised visit. &gt; On the 19th November, Consul Shipley reported that Mubarak had returned to Busrah with the Yali, and that they had both been engaged for several hours communicating with Constantinople by telegraph. A report subsequently received (dated 13th November) showed that Mubarak was continuing his endeavours to ingratiate himself with the Porte, and was meeting with some success. On the same day (19th November), the Viceroy reported that he had 1256 / 1900 . instructed Colonel Kemball to go to Koweit and, if still necessary, to convey a warning to the Emir of Nejd. On the 26th November, the Viceroy further reported that Colonel Kemball n deprecated a visit to Koweit at present on the ground that it would probably encourage Mubarak to take further action against the Emir, who had real grievances against him. The Viceroy concurred ; and, the same view being taken by Her Majesty’s Government, instructions wer&amp; sent that the visit To v i cei ‘°y, should be postponed for the present. DecYgoo In this connection it should be mentioned that on the 13th October last (2595/1900.) the Erench Consul at Bagdad, M. Bouet, proceeded to Koweit in the Erench Government vessel “ Drome,” returning via Eao. The visit appears to have been arranged suddenly after an interview with the Vali, but the object of it has not as yet transpired. Here the matter stands at the present moment. The position of the Turks has been much improved in Koweit since Mohsin Pasha’s appointment as Vali, and it is clear that it was Turkish influence which averted the recent crisis. Moreover, by his recent visit to Busrah, Mubarak has to some extent recognised Turkish suzerainty, and is further stated (Consul Wratislaw’s No. 44, dated 22nd November 1900) to have given the Sultan an assurance of his fidelity, and to have promised to cease “ coquetting with foreign Powers.” S. 36. C10 From Foreign Office, dated 21st Nov. To ditto, dated 27th Nov. Political, (2566/1900.) It may be added that, a question having arisen out of the seizure of arms on the “ Hath or,” the shipper of which was said to be a merchant of Koweit, it was decided by Her Majesty’s Government that, “ as Koweit is not under “ formal British protection, natives of that country cannot be claimed as “ British protected persons or be justiciable to British Consular tribunals in “ Persia.” C.

Wednesday, 4th December 1901. —Arrived at Ormara, 130 miles, 9 a.m., anchored in the Eastern Bay, a mile and-a-half out, in 17 feet of water, and went ashore in 25 minutes in the steam launch. I was met on the shore by Abdul Aziz, the Naib of the Jam of Las Bela, who conducted us over the place. Ormara is the head-quarters of one of the eight Niabats of Las Bela and has a mixed population of Baluchis (500 families), Negroes (30), Khojahs (40) and Sinahi Banias (40), numbering in all some 600 houses. The Khojahs and Hindus have 10 or 12 shops each. The Khojahs do the export trade in shark’s fins, fish maws and salt fish. Each Khojah’s house has an enclosure at the back of it in which the fins and bladders and small fish are dried in the sun preparatory to export. The Hindus import piece goods and provisions and export ghi, dates and matting, also a little wool. The customs are let to a Khojah contractor for Us. 17,850 per annum. The imports amounted to about B^s. 1,55,000 and the exports to Rs. 1,92,000 for the last year, and the customs duty collected on these amounted to Its. 5,037 and Rs. 6,550, respectively. The customs duty levied is an uniform rate of 2| per cent, from local traders and 5 per cent, from foreigners, ad valorem, on both imports and exports. The Naib has power to try civil and 1043 F. D.I ' *v 2 criminal cases, but all liis judgments haye to be confirmed by the Wazir of Las Bela before they are executed. There is a camel dak to Bela. The telegraph station, consisting of one bungalow and one large office building and quarters and manned by a clerk in charge and three signallers, stands rather on the western side of the spit of sand forming the neck of the headland. It derives its water from wells and from tanks filled by rain water in winter. The village stands on the eastern shore of the spit immediately under the cliffs of the promontory. The Naib has his residence in a small stone building just outside the village called the Thana. A few of the leading Khojahshave stone houses, but all the local population live in matting huts. This matting, made from the pish palm, is the great manufacture of the place and is largely exported to India. The Musjids of the village are built of the local stone—a very soft sandstone that apparently soon wears away. There is no school, and the leading Khojahs and Hindus send their childern to Bombay and Sind for education. Las Bela territory was said to extend to, and to include, Giabar Heg to the west of the Basol lliver. Ormara is full of cats, and the dogs are covered with mange, said to be caused by living on fish. The beach is covered with sharks’ heads and refuse. The Is T aib at Ormara stated that no importation of arms was allowed at Ormara, and that if any arms were imported he would confiscate them. None, however, had been confiscated so far. There was only one Martini rifle said to be in the place. I sent for it, but could not get hold of it, the owner appar ently fearing that I would confiscate it. There were no apparent signs of any general trade in arms in the place. He-emharked and left Ormara at 2 P.M., arrived opposite Khulmat, 40 miles to the west, at 7-30 p.m., and anchored for the night. Thursday, 5th December 1901. —Started at 7 a.m. and an hour and a half’s steaming in the launch brought us up to Khulmat village. An Ormara Pilot took us in round to the east. The deeper channel marked in Commander Tindall’s survey lies to the west. At the entrance to the harbour we passed some fishermen’s huts on the east bank and a Buggalow moored in mid-channel. At the point on the west bank w'ere more fishermen's huts, and then at 8-30 we arrived at Khulmat village consisting of three huts belonging to Sind Banias trading here in matting and fish and a few Baluchis making the matting. About a mile to the south a few mat huts were the residence of Mir Bhaian, the Head of the Khulmat section of the Rind Baluchis. Mir Bhaian, Khulmati, according to his own account, was formerly the Chief of the Khulmats, numbering some 50 families scattered about on the west side of the harbour, and his boundary, in former days, he said, expended to the Basol River. Sir Robert Sandeman, however, he declared, fixed the Khulmat Harbour itself as the boundary between Las Bela and Kej of Makran, and the Sangur section of the Rakhshani Rinds now occupied the eastern shores of the Khulmat Harbour and were subjects of Las Bela. They numbered about 50 families under one Dost Muhammad, and the fisher’s huts we saw on the east bank at the entrance to the harbour were subjects of Las Bela. Ibis statement of Mir Bhaian’s does not seem to be correct, as Mr. Tate in his report of 14th April 1892, page 21, states that in March 1891 Sir Robert Sandeman, as a tentative measure, desired the Jam not to interfere east (west r) of the Basol River. Shinban Reg lies to west of the Basol River, and that apparently ought to be the dividing point. Mir Bhaian further said that he now owned allegiance to the Gitchki Sardars of Kej and he had no independent authority but acted as the agent of the Hindu customs con tractor of Pasni and Khulmat. This contract is let for Rs. 4,500 for the year and is paid to the Nazim of Makran. The taxes were levied at the following rates :— ^ On 100 bundles of pish leaves . . . . . ,8 annas. On 20 pieces of matting . . ..... 2r On fish, 2 per cent, ad valorem. I he dried fish were valued at the rate of Rs. 3 per hundred. They mostly seemed to be young sharks. Opposite the Khulmat village a Buggalow from? ( 55 ) 3 Each Mandoi was moored. It bad brought jawari and was taking away mat ting and fish. Another product of the place was fine lime made from burnt shells and used for whitewashing buildings and painting Bungalows. Xhulmat itself possesses no Buggalows of its own, only some Tonis or dugouts. There is no direct road from Khulmat to Kej, only round via Pasni. A road to Kolwa lies up the Basel River, Kolwa being five marches distant, the same as Kej. Drinking water is procured from wells under some palm trees in the distance. It was said to be sweet. The climate of Khulmat was said to be cooler than that of either Gvvadur or Ormara. There was no apparent sign of any importation of arms at the place or of any demand for arms. There were a good many pelicans, flamingoes and grebes in the harbour but no duck were seen. The distance from Khulmat to Pasni by sea is 19 miles. Left Khulmat at 9-55 and reached the ship again at 11-10 a.m*. Sailed at once and reached Astola Island, 19 miles out, at 1-15 p.m. Landed on a sand bank at the north-east side of the island and found it covered with shells and decaying carcases of huge turtles, climbed up the cliffs here some 200 feet in height and found the summit perfectly level. It is said to be the breeding place of numbers of Terns in May. We saw the dead bodies of some young lairds. The cliffs are mostly precipitous and can only be ascended at one or two places. The island is about half a mile broad and say 2 miles in length. Large brown eels were common in the pools amongst the rocks on the shore. Left Astola at 3-45 and reached Pasni at 6-30 p.m. Friday, the 6th December 1901 .—Left Pasni at 8 p.m. last night after landing a telegraph clerk and arrived at Gwadur, Bast Bay, at 6 a.m. Dis tance from Pasni 67 miles: distance from Karachi 251 miles. The horses and baggage were disembarked in three hours ; no conveniences exist for landing. The horses were slung from the ship into a country boat, and when that boat touched land the horses were thrown out, as best they could, into the water and waded ashore. In the case of baggage the heavy things were put into Tonis or canoes and so brought close in, lighter things were carried by men from the boats to the shore. No attempt has been made to erect a landing stage of any sort. The ship had to lie a mile out and could not get in closer. I went ashore in the steam launch accompanied by Kazi Fakir Ahmad, Native Assistant, Kalat, who had been sent ahead by the Political Agent to make the necessary arrangements for camels, and by Mir Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, who had been sent down by the Nazim of Makran to meet me. As I landed a salute of 13 guns was fired from the solitary gun possessed by the Wali, who had received orders by cable from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to receive me in person and fire a salute. An arch of welcome and strings of flags had been erected on the beach. Here I was met by His Highness the Sultan of Muscat’s Governor, locally known as the Wali of Gwadur, by name Saif-bin-Yuraf, and the Sultan’s Wazir, Shaikh Suliman, with his Arab sepoys and a crowd of Baluchis. The Indian Khojahs and Sind Banias were also present, headed by Munshi Abdul Karim, tbe Native Assistant to the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, also Mir Ashraf, Rind, and several other Rind Motabars who had come down from Kej with Mir Mehrab Khan. I gave the Wali leave at the telegraph office and after inspecting that I took up my quarters in the Agency bunga low which had been cleaned and furnished on purpose. The last occupant of the bungalow is said to have been Saiyid Timur, the son of the Sultan of Muscat, and he had left it in so dirty a state that it had all to be whitewashed afresh. The Arab population of Gwadur consists of only the Wali himself, and his garrison of 50 Arab sepovs. The present Wali speaks nothing but Arabic. H is pay is 70 dollars or Rs. 105 per mensem. Baluchi is the language of the place and the Baluchis number about 5,000 people. The foreign residents consist of 250 Khojahs and 200 Hindus including men, women and children. The Agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company is a Khojah, by name Muhammad BhaiRahmoo Maoji, and he is also the customs ontractor of the place. The customs contract for Gwadur and Pishukan, on the opposite shore of the Gwadur, Western Bay, which is the only source of revenue of theplace, is let by the Sultan of Muscat for 22,000 dollars a year, now equal to about Its. 33,000 at the rate of a dollar to Its. 1^. The imports amount to Rs. 6,00,000, of which 4-1 lakhs go to Kej Makran and consist of :— Piece goods, jowari, rice, wheat flour, tea, sugar, spices. The exports amount to Rs. 8,00,000, of which 6 lakhs are from Kej and consist of :— Wool, cotton, ghi, pulse, fish and dates. The customs duty levied on all these is a uniform rate of 4 per cent., od valorem. The telegraph staff at Gwadur, owing to the persistent malarious fever of the place, from which all foreigners suffer alike, has now been reduced to one man, who is both telegraph clerk and post master. A Parsi holds the post and a second was sent by the Director with me to assist him during my stay in Makran. A Baluch Munshi, by name Abdul Rahim, born at Gwadur, and a Muscat subject, known as the Native Assistant at Gwadur, and whose pay is Rs. 40 per mensem, is the representative of the Director of Persian Gulf lelegraphs in his capacity of Political Officer in charge of the Makran Coast. According to him Gwadur (Muscat) territory extends to the Karwat River on the east and Pishukan on the west. On the north the line of hills form the boundary. Pishukan is held by an Arab representative of the Wali of Gwadur with two Arab sepoys and contains some 20 families of Baluchis. The customs contract is included in that for Gwadur. Asked abcut the capabilities of the different Makran ports, Abdul Rahim stated that Gwadur was the best, Charbar second, Gwettar third, Jiwani, op posite Gwettar and near the mouth of the Dasht River in Kej territory, fourth, and Pasni fifth. Jiwani was said to possess 300 houses and 16 boats. Shimal Bandar to have only five or six families of Baluchis and no boats. I see no reason why Pasni, which is the nearest harbour to Kej, should not be developed, and why British Baluchistan should not have a harbour of its own. At present all trade seems to gravitate to Gwadur, a foreign port, but this might be altered were Pasni and Jiwani properly developed. Macgregor, at page 13 of his book “Wanderings in Baluchistan,” considers Pasni and Jiwani as the most suitable places for the landing of troops owing to the greater convenience of the routes from them leading into the interior. I hope to inspect both places later on. In the afternoon I inspected the town of Gwadur. There is one narrow street in which the Khojahs and Hindus have their shops. The centre of the town comprises a walled enclosure with two whitewashed round towers called the fort, in which the Wali resides with his men and in which the Khojahs and Hindus live with their families. The Wali’s Court-house is a long entrance passage with a stone ledge, as a seat, on either side. Inside the Khojahs have a fine building as a Musjid, from the roof of which a good view of the place can be obtained all round. The Musjid had all been freshly done up in the hopes of a visit from Agha Khan, and the flags put up in my honour were originally obtained in Agba Khan’s honour. I was joined at the fort by the Wali and his men and they took me to see the Jama Musjid, a grand stone building built by subscription with a Kanda- hari Moolla, curiously enough, in charge of it who is also the Kazi of the town and sits with the Wali for the settlement of cases in the entrance passage to the fort above described. All the rest of the town consisted of Baluch mat huts. To the south of the town lay some cemeteries, in one of which a stone domed mausoleum had an inscription on the eastern wall “ Built by Nakhuda, Bangi, Ismail, to the memory of Mirak, Bang! and Allahdad Bangi, dated 873 H.” or A.D. 1468. On the top of the headland is an ancient dam across a small ravine formed of large blocks of stone, all dovetailed one into the other. Saturday, the 7th December 1901 .—Gwadur to first Nagor wells, 5 miles. In the morning the Wali of Gwadur came to call. I had a talk with him about5 the importation of arms. He declared, that no arms were imported at present at Gwadur. He acknowledged that up till the last few months arms were imported without hindrance, but said that when he was appointed Wali a month ago and went to the Sultan of Muscat for his final audience the Sultan specially directed him to carry out the wishes of the English in the matter of arms and to prevent their importation and sale to Baluchis. The Mali stated that all packages arriving at the Custom-house were opened and examined in the presence of his men and any arms found would he confiscated. He acknowledged that none had been confiscated so far. So far as I was able to ascertain these assurances on the part of the Wali are, practically speaking, worthless. No proper examination is enforced and arms can still be purchased without difficulty. A check on the open import of aims has doubtless been established, hut that they are secretly imported there can be no doubt. About two months ago, according to Mir Mehrab Khan and Munshi Abdul Bahim, 10 Martini rifles sighted up to 1,200 yards were imported from Muscat, and Munshi Abdul Rahim bought one of these himself with 200 cartridges for Rs. 60. I saw this rifle. It had a short barrel only two or three inches longer than our cavalry carbine and a roughened grip to the stock, like a sporting rifle, but it had no mark on it to show where it was made. Another Martini rifle brought to me for inspection was marked Eield Rifle Company, Birmingham.” From all I could hear there is still no difficulty for a man to go across to Muscat, buy a rifle and bring it back to Gwadur. No one seems to stop a man carrying a rifle. About a year ago a party of Afridis aie said to have come to Gwadur through Kharan and Panjghur and to have gone to Muscat and to have bought rifles and to have returned the way they came. It is also said that there are some Afghan Refugees, formerly adherents to Sardar Ayub Khan, now living at Bahu Kalat, to the north of Gwettar, on the Persian side of the frontier, who carry on a regular trade in arms imported from Muscat. Ihere is also said to be another Afghan in Dizak who lives by trade in arms. These men, I hear, are trying to get registration certificates as British subjects as a protection against Persian officials. It is clear that the issue of these certificates requires to be carefully guarded. According to the Wali of Gwadur and Munshi Abdul Rahim the importation of arms and ammunition from Muscat to Persian territory at Charbar and Gwettar still continues and anybody can purchase arms at those places. So far as I could judge by the sight of the people in the town there is a large demand for arms at Gwadur. Armed men were going about on every side. The Wali possessed a Mauser pistol and the Wazir had a curious revolver with a barrel some nine or ten inches in length, excluding the chambers, and sighted up to 400 yards. This revolver was fitted with a removable skeleton stock of white metal, which could be screwed in or out at pleasure and was jointed to fold up flat. There was no mark to show where the revolver was made. These revolvers could be bought in Gwadur, with 200 cartridges, for Rs. 25 each. Mir Ashraf, Rind, and the other Rind Motabirs, who had come to Gwadur in connection with the collection of camels, were dismissed by me to their homes in Kulanj, Dasht and Tump. The total number of camels collected amounted to about 1,000. Of these, 985 were employed as follows at the rate of annas 8 a day per baggage camel and annas 12 per day per riding camel, viz .:— Camels. Commissariat rations for the troops for three months ... 635 Baggage of the troops, viz., 250 men of the 1st Baluchis, some sappers and followers, in all 320 men and five British officers under Major Tighe ........ 171 Gun ammunition and gun cotton ...... 22 Agent, Governor-Generafis camp, Sardars, sowars, etc. . . ,107 Total . 935 1013 F. D.f 6 About 500 of these camels were obtained from the Kalanch district imme- diately to the north of Gwadur, 300 from Dasht and 100 from Tump and the remainder from the Gwadur district of Nagor. No difficulty was experienced in collecting them and probably 2,000 could have been easily collected with one month’s notice. The only thing to be noted is that the camelmen have no ropes and the pack saddles are small and bad and unsuited to bulky loads and boxe|. Ihe saddles are intended to carry pish palm leaf bags with loads of dates or fish and the only ropes in the country are made also from pish—the dwart palm hbre. It is necessary to bring proper ropes, nets and salitas, etc., from India tor our loads, also saddles for riding camels. Grass for horses is scarce and expensive at Gwadur. No grain can be got on the road between Gwadur andTurbat and has to be carried with one. Leaving Gwadur at 3-15 p.m., we rode along the shore of the Eastern Bay and arrived at the first group of wells at 4-15. The water was muddy and brackish and hardly sufficient for the party. There were a few Baluch Nomads scattered about in the surrounding country, but no habitations near ; a Quarter of a mile to the eastward was a sand volcano close to a little mud mound The mud volcano itself is not on the mound but in the open plain and consists of a circular pit some 35 or 40 paces in circumference with steep sides some 3 or 4 feet in depth full of liquid mud. Every half minute or so the mud bubbled up. The volcano is called Chasma-i-Daria, or the eye of the sea, and the people all believe it is connected with the sea, and that it bubbles up with noise and force whenever a storm beats on the shore. Sunday the 8th December 1^2.—Menu, 10 miles.—Four miles out we passed the second group of Nagor wells, now nearly dry owing to want of rain durin- the past year. The road here ran through a mass of mud hillocks stretching to the foot of the Koh-i-Mahdi, a precipitous mud hill or rather skeleton of a hill worn into all sorts of wierd shapes and corners. Eor the next 6 miles the road ran across a sandy plain covered with shells in many places. We found the camp pitched to the west of a dry nullah called Sor, by 3 small wells some 10 feet in depth. Water muddy and brackish and limited in quantity to a party of 300 to 400 men. The place belongs to Gwadur and is the best stage for the first march out from Gwadur. Patches of cultivation exist where rain ivater can be held up by long bunds but no land revenue from this is taken by the Wali. Grass for horses obtain able, wood scarce, supplies nil. Monday, 9th December 29tM.—Kappar, 23 miles.—The road led eastwards across a couple of dry nullahs and came to the telegraph line some 6 miles out. At the 9th mile we crossed the Barambab nullah which Mir Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, claimed as the boundary between Kej and Gwadur. At the 11th mile we came to the Karwat nullah and Mir Mehrab Khan stated there was valuable fishing at the mouth of the Karwat wffiich made it a valuable asset, otherwise the land was all broken mud heaps utterly useless for anything. From here the road led east up a nullah bed till we finally emerged on the plain by the telegraph wire some 6 miles on. At about the 20th mile we reached the first Kappar huts by a small hill, but, as there was not sufficient water there, we had to go on another 2 or 3 miles to some 10 or 12 shallow wells about 6 feet deep out in the open plain to the south of a patch of cultiv able land sprinkled with babul and palm trees in which brown partridges and doves were to be found. Kappar belongs to the Kulanch district of Kej and is not a village but a sub-district of itself. Jowari stalks obtainable as fodder for horses, but no supplies. Tuesday, 10th December 29(92—Belar, 15 miles.—The road led north through better country than we had hitherto passed through. We crossed several dry nullahs and the land was bunded for cultivation in all directions and well sprinkled with babul and palm trees. At the 4th mile the Kappar district came to an end at the Ziarat of Sheh Chiragh, a platform surrounded by sticks and white flags, by the road side. Kappar is said to contain about 120 families of Baluchis called Kappari. At the Ziarat, Sheh Chiragh, we entered the Nalinth district. That extended for another 7 miles and contains about 100 families of Baluchis called Band. After rounding the* 'L o(&gt; xxT) 7 end of the Daram hills, which were said to he full of Ibex and Gad, we then passed through some low hillocks and entered the Belar district which is populated by 120 families of Baluchis called Ruzh. Belar is the name of the nullah and we are encamped on the banks of this nullah, in the bed of which there are four or five wells some 5 or 6 feet in depth. The water is sweet, and any number of wells could be dug apparently if required. Tamarisk wood is abundant. Dry jowari stalks were brought in for the horses, but no supplies were obtainable. Grass could be got in small quantities within a little distance. This grass is more properly a shrub. It grows like a small bush and is called Baramshu in the south of Makran and Barshu in Kharan and to the north. Camels do not eat it but horses feed on it readily. Wednesday, 11th December 1901. —Biri, 18 miles—Through barren country the whole way. Some 5 miles out we crossed the Chilian nullah, now dry, but in wet weather evidently liable to high floods. This joins the Belar lower down and its bed was full of tamarisk and babul trees. At the 8th mile we arrived at the pool and well in the Telar nullah at the foot of the gauge through the Telar range of hills. Water brackish but drinkable. The road here is rocky and bad. We had to dismount and it took 15 minutes to walk through the pass. The road beyond leads for the greater part of the -way through low hills known as Band-i-Talar. The watershed of this, known as the Usman Gul Darra, was crossed at the 14th mile and then there was a steady descent of 4 miles to Biri which consists of nothing but a well 75 feet in depth of muddy but fairly s^veet water near an old grave yard said to belong to the Zikris, a sect of Muhammadans said to have been started by one Pir Tarik of Peshawar. At first the Gitchkis and many others of Makran embraced this form of religion, but Khan Nasir Khan killed and perse cuted them and the numbers decreased. At piesent the sect is mostly confined to the Nomad Baluchis of Southern Makran, extending from the Jhallawan country on the east to Sirbaz, in Persian Baluchistan, on the west. The Pir Tarik is said to have abolished the Muhammadan prayers and to have instituted a new formula called “ Zikr ” or recitation of the Kulima and other verses in their place and to have established his own Mecca, or place of pilgrimage, at a hill near Turbat in Kej called Koh-i-Murad. The Zikris are credited by the Sunnis with offering up their women to their priest under the name of Zakat or religious charity and of orgies of sorts, but with what truth is not known. There are no habitations at Biri and no supplies and no fodder were procurable. Jawari stalks for the horses had to be brought from Kohak, a village on the Dasht River 6 miles to the west. Thursday, 12th December 1901. —Kani, 18 miles.—The road led over hard “ pat ” rough and broken in some places and level in others. At the 3rd mile we passed the Dadde nullah, a deep channel with banks some 40 feet in height, running west into the Dasht River. At the 8th mile we passed Kasar, where there is a patch of rain cultivation and of babul and palm trees and one well, said to be of the same depth as that at Biri, viz., 75 feet. Water also is collected here in rain. There is said to he the remains here of an old fort or Kasar (palace). At the 11th mile we passed the Nilag nullah, which runs down to Kunjati on the Dasht River, at which place the troops encamped instead of at Biri as water was plentiful there in pools in the bed of the Dasht River. At the 13th mile a patch of date and babul trees, known as Putwani, was passed and thence rounding the end of some low nullahs we reached Kani at the ISth mile. The water-supply at Kani consist of one well 15 feet in depth. The water is brackish. The supply in the well was not sufficient for the party. Three or four holes were dug in the sand of the nullah some 300 or 400 yards to the east where there is water close to the surface. There are no habitations at Kani and no supplies. Camel grazing is obtainable at the other stages, but the only fodder for the horses was some old dry baramshu grass from the hills around, which they would not eat. Friday, 13th December 2S01-—Turbat, the head quarters of the Kej dis trict, 18 miles.—The road led east up the nullah ; at the 5th mile the watershed was crossed ; at the 7th mile a road to Kalatuh led off to the north ; and at the 11th mile the hills were cleared and the open country of the Kej valley was8 reached. The Kej valley here presented the sight of one line of date palms stretching as far as the eye could see from east to west backed by the long range of the Euleda hills immediately to the north, of them. The Kalatak fort could be seen standing out in the midst of the palms down the valley and between that and Turbat the ruins of the ancient seat of Government in Kej, known as the Miri, which was deserted some 40 years ago owing to inundation from the river. At the village of Shaitum, at the 15th mile, I was met by Mir Bhai Khan, the son of Sardar Shell Umar, Gitchki, with Mulla Khudadadand other Motabirs of Turbat and Kusk Kalat, the village where the Gitchki Sardars live, who accompanied me to camp at Turbat. The Nazim and all the Sardars were unable to leave Nodiz, the fort seized by Muhammad Ali, the brother of Muhammad Umar, Naushirwani, which they are now besieging. Two men of the Nazim's have been killed and two men of Mir Shah Nawaz Khan, Naushirwani, have been wounded and sent into our camp for treatment, and the Nazim is afraid that if he were to leave the place the men shut up in the fort would he allowed to escape. At Turbat I was met by Major Tighe and the officers of the detachment of 250 men of the 1st Baluchis and 20 men of the sappers who had arrived frorn Gwadur two days before me. In the evening Sardar Sir Nauroz Khan of ^Kharan, Mir Mehrab Khan and Mir Bhai Khan, Gitchkis, and all the British and Native officers dined with me in camp. After dinner Mir Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, who did not smoke stated that none of the Gitchkis- smoked tobacco. This may be taken as evident proof of their Sikh descent. 1 Saturday, 14th December 1901. —Turbat. Halt.—I inspected the fort at Turbat, the seat of the Nazim’s Government. The Nazim himself lives outside and is building a bungalow as a Court-house. The fort is a dirty dilapidated looking place garrisoned by the Nazim’s Brahui levies and stands rather higher than the surrounding country. A good view can be obtained from the top over the village and the surrounding palm groves. The village contains about 300 families of Baluchis and two Banias’ and one Mussalman’s shop. Most of their dealings are carried on by barter for grain, etc. The Baluchis live mostly in mat huts, each family in its own compound surrounded by a hedge of plain leaves. The well-to-do men have large square houses ot sun-dried bricks built on a high plinth in addition to the mat huts and all have covered spaces supported by pillars for use in the hot weather. Grain and lucerne are grown in the date groves under the shade of the trees' Iheie seems to be little cultivation outside the date groves. Sunday, 15th December WM.-Turbat. Halt.-I sent a message on arriral to the Nazim, to report the present state of affairs, and a letter received from him tins morning reports that he and nine Sardars and Motabirs with about 1,000 men are besieging Muhammad Ali, Din Muhammad (half brothers of Muhammad Umar) with some 80 men in the Naudiz fort. Of these 80 men 20 are said to possess breech-loading rifles and they have supplies in the fort to last them a month. rr The Nazim expresses his inability to take the fort with the Mekranis but says he is doing his best to prevent the escape of those inside. He states that all the mischievous men in Kej, who are hostile to Government, with the exception of the two men, Muhammad Umar and Noushirwan, and their three or lour adherents are in the fort, and proposes that the Naudiz fort should be destroyed and the people inside it fully punished. , p 1 J iav( ; ^P lied telling the Nazim that lam awaiting the arrival of Lieuten- fort COl ° nel Sh ° WerS and that he 18 res P ons ible not to let the men out of the r r /V\ e foll °™£ ^ 1S ^ S sll0w ^ ie men who are aiding the Nazim.

He was accompanied by— Sardar Ghous Baksh, Raisani, and Khan Bahadur Muhammad Hassan Khan, Gitchki of Sami, Khan Bahadur Rasul Bakhsh, Raisani, Khan Bahadur Yusuf Khan, Kurd, Mir Rahim Khan, Kurd, Mir Rahim Khan, Mengal, Jamadar Ismail Khan, Kurd, Jamadar Bahawal Khan, Musiani, who all came to dinner with me in camp in the evening. In the afternoon we all marched to Kalatuk. The road led for 3 miles down the valley to the village of Kushtang and thence turning into the date groves, it passed at the 4th mile through Kush Kalat, the residence of Sardar Shell Umar, the Gitchki Chief, and of Mir Mehrab Khan and his other brothers, and thence across the bed of the Kejkur river, here nearly a mile in width with a good flow of water in it through the village of Gina down to Kalatuk, the residence of Mir Abdul Karim, Gitchki, and his brother Shaikh Kasim. The ruins of the ancient citadel of Kej, known as the “ Miri ” stands on the right bank of the river opposite Kosh Kalat. According to local tradi tion, this fort dates back to the time of Kai Khusru of the Kayani dynasty in Persia. The present ruins stand some 100 feet in height, and are said* to have been only deserted some 40 or 50 years ago, when inundations of the river destroyed all the cultivable land. There are the remains of a wall and buildings at the foot of the fort, and at one time the tower apparently extended some distance to the north and east. A letter was received by Colonel Showers this morning from Sartip Ali Hashim Khan, Satwat-ul-Mumalik, Deputy Governor of Bampur, dated the 4th December, stating that he had received no orders from either the Governor of Kirman, or the Persian Government, to meet Colonel Showers. This was immediately communicated to the Foreign Department with the request that the Persian Government might be requested to order the Sartip to meet Colonel Showers at Sarbaz on 1st January. So long ago as 14th September 1901, the Persian Government informed His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that orders had been sent to the Governor of Kirman to send troops with an official to co-operate with Colonel Showers in the recovery of the plundered property. On the 18th October they further stated that new guns had been despatched from Tehran which would reach the frontier during the latter half of December. On arrival here in the latter half of December, we find that no orders have been issued, and that no troops have come and no guns have arrived even at Kirman much less at the frontier. The Nazim of Makran, in reply to my letter of yesterday, writes to say that he had prevented the rebels from getting out of the Naudiz fort for the last 50 days, and that strict watch was being'kept on all four sides, and I mUht rest assured. n ]Uii Melnab Khan, Gitchki, reports that news has reached him that the Damanis of Sarhad and the Chief of Magas had refused to help Muhammad Umar. Tuesday, 17th. December 1501. —Kalatuk. Halt.—Lieutenant-Colonel Showers proceeded in the morning to see the Nazim at Naudiz accompanied by Major Tighe and Captain Hulsebery of the 1st Baluchis and Lieutenant Corry, Royal Engineer. On arrival they were at once fired upon from the fort and this fire on them was maintained throughout but without effect. The fort was found to be a stronger place than had been supposed. Mir Mehiab Khan had described it as some 30 yards by 15 in size, built upon11 a solid plinth about 9 feet in height with walls above that again 8 feet thick and loopholed all round, and with a tower on the northern side. They found it apparently considerably larger than this and the loopholed tower to be a high and strong structure giving a commanding fire all round. They were unable to approach within 350 yards of the fort. Major Tighe informed me that he considered it right to wait for the guns before attacking, as, in his opinion, the fort might be taken at once with a loss of 40 or 50 men, this heavy loss might be avoided where the battlements of the tower knocked down first by artillery fire. Lieutenant-Colonel Showers stated that the guns were expected to arrive at Sami to-morrow, which would bring them to Turbat on the 19th and Naudiz the 20th, and subsequently gave me the following note: — “I went out to Naudiz this morning accompanied by Major Tighe, Captain Hulsebery and Lieutenant Corry. The place is 8| miles from here. I was met on arrival by the Nazim and all his Sardars. His camp is located about 600 yards from the Naudiz fort by a big Karez the embankment of which screens them from the fort’s fire. * This Karez runs right down to the fort and an advance could be made along it. The Sangars mentioned by the Nazim in his reports are all quite close to the fort, say 50 or 60 yards from it. They are only occupied at night, as during the day time the Nazira thinks they would be untenable. They, or the approaches to them, must certainly be very exposed and we did not visit them, so it is not easy to say exactly whether the arrangements for preventing Muhammad All’s escape are efficient or not. Viewing the fort and surrounding country by daylight it would seem difficult to block every avenue of escape. I think, therefore, that the troops should move up to Naudiz to supplement the Nazim’s arrangements. The more men we have arround the place the better, and the presence of the troops will lend heart to such of the Nazim’s people who are loyal to him and at the same time discourage any attempt at treachery on the part of those who are not. Once there we can decide whether the place should be blown up and taken by assault, or whether we should await the arrival of the guns on the 20th or 21st. *• There is an outlying Sangar placed about 400 yards from the fort and about 200 yards further along the Karez than the Nazim’s camp. This we visited and obtained a good view of tbe north side of the fort and of the tower. The latter looks strong and solid and should not be approached until breached either by gun-cotton or the guns. “ The Nazim has not blocked up the passes by wbich Muhammad Ali could escape if once out of the fort. He thinks it unnecessary as Muhammad Ali’s party are not mounted while he has himself a lot of horses and camels which he keeps ready saddled all night. With these he could soon overtake the fugitives and even, he thinks, arrive at the pass they were making for before them and thus intercept them. “ I may mention that a good many shots (about 50) were fired at us from tbe fort, both while we were examining the place and as we were riding away from Naudiz to return here. They did no harm, but it seems to show that Muhammad Ali means continuing his resistance even against ourselves, for I think he must have been aware that we were not just an ordinary party of the Nazim’s men.” In the evening I inspected tbe Kalatuk fort belonging to Mir Abdul Karim, Gitchki, and his brother Shaikh Kasim. Abdul Karim being absent on duty with the Nazim at Naudiz and Shaikh Kasim away at Nal, I was shown over the fort by Fatteh Khan, the young son of Abdul Karim. The fort consists of a high tower and citadel on the north with the residencies of the two brothers in the lower portion to the south. A sketch of the fort made by Surveyor Gopal Singh is attached. The whole place is more or less surrounded by mat huts of Baluchis and palm trees.15 Tuesday, 18th December 1901.—Nodiz, 9 miles.—A sowar arrived at 10 P.M. last night from the Nazim, asking for the immediate despatch to him at Nodiz of some Makran sowars with Lieutenant-Colonel Showers. Sardar Ghaus Bakhsh, Raisani, with his men, Mir Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, and Khan Bahadur Muhammad Hassan Khan, Gitchki of Sami, who were in camp with me, also went off at once to help the Nazim in case of an attempt by Muham mad Ali to break out of the fort during the night. The infantry and sappers under Major Tighe marched for Nodiz at day break this morning. Lieutenant-Colonel Showers and I followed in the after noon. The road led along the north side of the valley through broken sandy ground covered with babul trees and bushes. We found our camp pitched to the east of the karez some distance to the north of the fort. The Nazim met me on arrival at my tents with his Sardars. In the evening the Nazim and all the Sardars not on duty in the sangars and the officers of the escort came to dinner with me in camp. At the con clusion the Nazim got up and made a short and well-worded speech thanking me in the name of those present for my hospitality, and remarking that by thus sitting down and dining with them I gave them the opportunity of exchanging views and of opening out their hearts for which they were very grateful. Thursday, 19th December WL—Nodiz. Halt.—Major Tighe yesterday evening found the Nazim’s men in the sangars round the fort so much afraid of an attempt on the part of the rebels to get out during the night and so very undependable altogether that he sent out a picket of his own men to assist in holding the most important points, telling off five men to each of the more exposed sangars. The night, however, passed quietly. The rebels simply continually shouting and apparently working hard strengthening their defences. At dawn the fort was again reconnoitred, and Major Tighe informs me that the fort is so well commanded by the tower and a square bastion at the south west corner, and is so strong generally, that he is confirmed in his opinion that it would not be right to attack it without waiting for the guns. The Nazim’s system of investment consists of a cordon of sangars all round at a distance of about 350 yards from the fort, which are held at night. By day these sangars are evacuated, and nothing much is done; the investors keep ing at a distance. All the Nazim’s men are fasting rigorously as it is the month of Ramzan. The heat is great, over SO in the tents. The sangars are held by local Makranis, but the Nazim has divided up his 80 Brahuis, armed with Sniders, who are the only men he can really rely upon, amongst the sangars and at night these keep watch 100 yards or so ahead of the sangars. It is upon these^ Brahuis that the brunt of keeping watch really falls, but even they do it so carelessly that two of them were cut up and killed by a party who surprised them from the fort one night. The rebels are hus banding their Martini ammunition and rarely fire their rifles ; all the shots so continually fired are apparently fired from matchlocks, etc., for which they have a large supply of powder. In the evening I rode over to Nasirabad, 4 miles to the west.. The fort there has been built up on the ruins of the former fort. It is now simply a walled enclosure, some 40 yards square, commanded by a strong and solid tower some 25 feet in height on the western side. The village consists of the Baluch mat huts scattered around below. The fort is garrisoned by a Duffadar and nine men of the Nazim’s Brahui levies. Friday, 20th December The cavalry of Lieutenant-Colonel Showers’ escort consisting of 50 sabres of the Sind Horse, under Lieutenant Mansell, came in at 8-30 p.m. last night, having marched the 23 miles from bami to Turbat in the morning, and the 21 miles from Turbat on to Nodiz m the afternoon,—total 44 miles in 18 hours. Lieutenant Orton, 26th Bombay Infantry, the Intelligence office^ his escort, arrived with them, and the infantry, under Jamadar bhakar Khan, marched in early in the morning. The two guns of the Murree Mountain Battery, under Lieutenant Hart, R.A., arrived at 8-30 a.m. Considering that this portion of the escort 1043 F. D.had been marching an average of 17 miles a day for the last ten days, without a single halt, the quick way they came in does them all much credit. Major Tighe issued his orders for attack at once. I summoned the Nazim and explained the plan to him with Major Tighe. Briefly it was that the Nazim was to collect all his men investing the fort into three bodies—on the north, west, and south—to prevent confusion and permit of them being recognised as friends by the sepoys. The Nazim’s mounted men to guard the country to the north-west and north-east of the fort. The Sind Horse were sent round to hold the open country by the river bed to the south. A small party of infantry, under Lieutenant Orton, 26th Baluchistan Regiment, were told off to keep the fire from the eastern walls of the fort in check. The guns were moved round by the east to take up a position about 500 yards to the south east of the fort, whence they were to knock down first the battlements of the south-west bastion and, secondly, of the redoubt on the west face. Finally they were to turn their fire on the tower and when they did this the infantry, who were sent round to the west to take up a position in the nullah at the south-west angle, would then advance and storm the fort; if necessary, the sappers blowing in the wall with gun-cotton in advance of them. All moved off at 10-30 a.m. The first gun was fired at 11-20 a.m. Lieutenant-Colonel Showers and the Nazim proceeded with Major Tighe to the west of the fort. I took up a position with my mounted police and levies on the karez near the Nazim’s main picket to the north. The bullets at first flew thick here, but we were covered by the karez banks. I left the picket when the guns moved forward and moved along the east face and round to the south, passing the cavalry and moving in to join the guns which were then breaching the fort at close range. On getting up near the fort I first passed the Nazim (who was busy saying his prayers), and I learned that Colonel Showers had left him and gone in with the troops. Under some trees close to tbe fort I found Captain Stewart at work and two British officers and several sepoys wounded. Lieutenant Corry, It.E., in right wrist and shoulder and Lieutenant P. G. Grant, 27th Baluchis, in left shoulder and neck. Pressing on 1 was just in time to enter the fort with the final rush as the guns ceased firing. Time about 1-30 p.m. Muhammad Ali, Noushirwani, lay dead in front, and Murad, Baluch, the owner of Naudiz, who had let Muhammad Ali in, was also dead. Three or four other bodies lay around, but the killed were mostly buried in the debris. Fourteen wounded men and 63 prisoners were taken alive.I found that, as soon as the south-west bastion had been silenced by the guns, the sappers under Lieutenant Corry ran up to blow in the walls, hut find ing a hole in the wall already made the sappers and covering party made their way in. Lieutenant Corry was first man in and he was followed by Lieutenant Grant and also by Lieutenant-Colonel Shower's, who joined the party. When they got inside they found themselves under fire from a round tower behind them, in the underground passage of which were men firing on them from one side, while a mud building in the centre of the fort, the existence of which had not been known before, gave shelter to others in front Here it was that Lieutenant Grant was first shot through the shoulder. His men were hanging back a bit behind, and while urging them to come on a band of men rushed at them from the building in front. At this moment just as one man was cutting at him, Lieutenant Grant was shot through the neck from the tower behind, and fell. Lieutenant Corry was fired at by a man as he was firing his revolver and the bullet passed through both his wrist and his right shoulder. The man came on with his sword, and Lieutenant Corry guarded hmself with his sword in his left hand, with the loss of one of the fingers of his right hand and a cut on his left shoulder till he drove his sword into the man’s face, and his sapper havildar coming up drove his bayonet into him and finished him. Lieutenant-Colonel Showers disposed of his assailant with his revolver, and he was tinisbed off with the bayonet also. The men seeing the two British officers fall drew back, and there was a temporary check. Colonel Showers walked out alone the last to leave and marvellously to say came out unhurt. His coolness and courage was the admiration of all. Major Tighe withdrew the infantry and ordered up the guns to close range. Firing through the walls they smashed in the mud hut in the centre. It was during this interval that many of the prisoners taken crept out and gave themselves up. The remainder in the fort, when the final rush came, begged for mercy which was given them. This accounts for the small number killed. Had a second charge taken place at once hardly a man would have been left alive. There was a great rush for the arms and ammunition. All the sepoys brought out were collected in a heap, but in the crowd and confusion many were carried away, notably some fine silver mounted rifles which, though seen, were never found again. The total number collected are Martinis 11, Sniders 8, muzzle-loading rifles 6, smooth-bore carbines 6, double barrel muzzle-loading guns 2, match locks 17, swords 21. The total casualties amounted to— Two British officers severely wounded; Three men, 3rd Baluchis, killed ; Three men, 3rd Baluchis, one gunner and one sapper severely wounded. Of the enemy, in addition to Muhammad Ali and Murad, the leader’s, Muhammad Ali’s, brother and cousin Din Muhammad and Bahadur Khan were among the wounded. One of the wounded men died, and the total number found and buried is reported by the Nazim to be 14. Four men are missing, according to the prisoners, and they must either have escaped, which is unlikely, or else are buried in the debris as is supposed. Saturday, 21st December 1901. —Nodiz. Halt.—The prisoners have now been sorted, and it is found that 30 are Persian subjects, residents of Sib and Dizak in Persian territory. The remainder, it is said, are mostly Makran out laws, who came from Persia with Muhammad Ali. I decided that the prisoners should be tried and punished by the Khan, and the Nazim lost no time in convening a Jirga of the Sardars and Motabars, in accordance with the custom of the country. The Jirga have recommended that one man should he hung, and that the others should be given various terms of imprisonment, varying from 20 years to 3. The award of the Jirga is to be forwarded to His Highness the Khan for confirmation. Sunday, 22nd December 1901. —Turbat, 21 miles.—The troops marched to Kalatak. Colonel Showers and I going straight through to Turbat. The wounded are all doing well. Lieutenants Corry and Grant were carried in 1043 F. D.Jrv — 20 camel kajawnhs, but Captain Stewart hopes that in a few days they will be able to move about a little. The most serious case is a sepoy with a broken thigh bone. Monday, 23rd December 1901. —Turbat Kej. Halt.—The troops and prisoners from Nodiz marched in in the morning. I held a Darbar in the af ternoon. The Nazim made a speech giving particulars regarding Nodiz and bringing to notice the services of various Sardars and Motabars who gave him assistance. The award of the Jirga detailing the sentences passed on the prisoners was then read out, and after that I addressed the assembly, my speech being read in Persian, Urdu and Baluchi. I conferred khillats on the Nazim, Sardars and Motabars recommended by him for good service. In the evening I gave a dinner to all. A total of 73 sat down including the Nazim and all Sardars and Motabars present and the Native officers of the troops. The British officers were all present with me. Tuesday, 24th December 1901. —Basulkan, 17 miles.—The road led south through low hills and broken stony ground the whole way. Three miles out we passed a little water and the road here wants clearing of stones and also in other places further on. The watershed was crossed about the 12th mile and a little beyond we came to a little water in the nullah called Gokpharosh, a Baluch word meaning cow-breaker, where there is a nasty bit of rock for laden animals. At the 13th mile, where the nullah emerges into open ground, are to be seen the remains of the sangars erected along the crest of the low outer hills by Baluch Khan, Noushirwani, and his men when they were so signally defeated by the force under Colonel Mayne, of the 30th Baluchis, in 1898 and fled leaving 180 dead on the field. They held a strong position on either side of the mouth of the pass and the shell fire, it is said, did not kill a man there. It was only when their left was turned that they were forced to retire and then it was they suffered their loss. Basulkan consists of nothing but a small pool of water in the nullah bed. It has no habitations and no supplies. There is another road to Pasni leading through Pidarak to the east, but that is said to be rocky and not so good for laden animals. Mir Kustam Khan, the younger brother of Sardar Sheh Umar and of Mir Mehrab Khan, Gitchkis, has been told off by the Nazim to escort me to Pasni. Khan Bahadur Muhammad Hasan of Sami and Khan Sahib Hurra Khan, Gitchki of Turbat, also accompanied me to the first stage out. On arrival at Basulkan I was met by Mir Kamal Khan, Bezango of Pidarak, who accom panies me on. The prisoners taken at Nodiz have been brought on with me, and the example thus made of them ought to have a good effect in deterring others from doing what they did for some time to come. The Nazim has sent the prisoners under a guard of a jamadar and 40 men, but I found they were in a sad plight on arrival. The wounded are carried on charpoys by the other prisoners, but they had nothing to cover them. I collected all the tent salitas and gave them to cover the prisoners at night. It gets very cold here now ]ust before dawn. The prisoners get nothing but dry dates to eat and I had to send my bhisti to give them water. The Nazim had made no arrangements for them whatever. Pidarak village is said to contain some 120 families. The fort belonging to Mir Kamal Khan, Bazengo, is one of the three now left standing in Kej not in possession of the Nazim. Wednesday, 25th December 1901. —Surap, 16 miles.—The road led the whole way through barren stony country without a sign of life. Not a bird even was to be seen, and the only thing that grew was the “ Pish” or dwarf palm in the nullah beds from which the people seem to make almost every thing they have from houses to shoes. The rocks all run across the country in parallel ridges east and west with strata of rock from half an inch to three inches in thickness sticking upon edge. The last five miles ran down a nullah bed to the camp pitched by a pool of brackish water in the nullah. No habitations and no supplies. Grass and wood was collected locally, everything else was brought from Pidarak.Zit 21 Thursday, 26th December 1901. —Ghulamani Bet, 18 miles.—All the way through desolate broken country. For the first five miles the road led down the nullah bed through low tamarisk trees. Then across open stony ground past Ziarat-i-Sheh Ramzan at about the 12 th mile and for the last four miles down a nullah bed again to three pools of water by which the camp was pitched. No habitations and no supplies. Grass and wood were collected locally. All else came from Pidarak. Mir Kamal Khan of Pidarak returned from here to meet the Political Agent at Pidarak. Friday, 27th December 1501.—Thaloi Sunth, 11 miles, a Baluch word meaning the end of the mud hills. The road led on down the nullah bed for five miles and then crossed through low mud hills for another four miles, and emerged into the Shadikaur nullah in which the camp was pitched. No habit ations and no supplies. Water from a pool in the river bed. Supplies were brought out from Pasni, grass and wood brought in locally. The road to Khulmat is said to branch off from here and goes via Kundi Shor. The guides here say though that there is no water at Kundi Shor and that it is necessary to camp at Baranguli where there is a pool of water and at Guzdan where there is a well. Saturday, 28th December 1901. —Pasni, 12 miles.—The road followed the course of the Shadikaur nullah all the way, passing pools of water at intervals. The river here is evidently liable to very high floods, and travelling is probably impossible in bad weather. Some three miles out we came to salt water, where the tides run up to and a mile beyond that sand hills commenced. The Telegraph bungalow is about quarter of a mile to the north of the village, and is entirely surrounded by land. Sunday, 29th December 1901. —Pasni. Halt.—Distance from Karachi, 195 miles. The village contains 222 mat huts with a population of 873 persons, of 'which there are— Baluchis, etc. Sidis . . Khojahs Hindus 0 552 . 301 4 . 16 Total . . 873 There are 8 Hindu traders’ shops, 2 Khojahs and 1 Sidi. The Hindus trade in piece goods, grain and groceries. The Khojahs and Sidis in fish and matting. The chief articles imported from India are rice, flour, sugar, spices, piece goods and twine for nets. The exports are mats and raw pish, dates, ghi, wool, cotton, dried fish and sharks’ fins. The following note by Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh gives the customs rates and trade returns in detail:— Seth Basra Mai and Lalu Mai (originally of Karachi, but now of Gwadur) hold the contract for taxes and customs duty levied at Pasni, Khulmat, Shumal Bandar and Giaban Reg for Rs. 9,000 for two years from 1st April 1900 to 31st March 1902. The rates and taxes and duty to be levied by the contractor are as follows :— Taxes.

The thermometer registers from 90 to 98 in the shade in summer, hut there is generally a cool breeze and the heat is only oppressive for a few days at the end of October. The winter is pleasant. There is no local cultivation. The people are^all fishermen and live by fish except during the monsoon, from 15th June to 15th September, when their boats are laid up. The water is sweet and good. . It is procured from wells, and any amount of water can be procured by simply digging wells three or four feet deep. In the afternoon I inspected the village which consists entirely of mat huts. The only building is the Musjid built lately by Mulla Jagardin, the head of the boatmen, at a cost of Rs. 900. I presented him with a Khillat as some recognition of his good work and sent his bill of charges to the Nazim for reduction of rates. The ruins of the house of Mir Suba, Kbulmati, are still extant. He joined the 1898 rebellion, and his house was blown up in conse quence. His brother Mir Muhammad is now the local Baluch Chief and gets part of the telegraph subsidy. We saw several boats come in from their fishing. They had about 100 £&lt; Mushka ” fish, weighing about 3 or 4 lbs. a piece, all caught with a hook and line. The contractor has the right to 10 per cent, of all catches. The fish were sold to our men at two pice or a half penny a piece. The contractor complains that he cannot get his dues from the fishermen at Khulmat, as whenever he demands payment they cross over to the other side and say they are Las Bela subjects. I doubt if Las Bela has any right to a share of khulmat. The contractor gets nothing either from Shumal Bandar, though that place is also included in his contract. The Telegraph bungalow at Pasni is a good building with three large rooms, the centre one being the office. All that is required is to enclose the two end verandahs to form dress ing rooms with a door into a big room and another into the bathroom. A new store is required, and that could be built up against the back of the kitchen. There would then be one good set of quarters for the telegraph clerK and a spare set of quarters for travellers. Monday, 30th December 1501.—Embarked on the Datrich Stewart, which arrived from Karachi at 9-30 a.m. With it came Lieutenant-Colonel Fullerton, I.M.S., Agency Surgeon, and Captain Ramsay, 3rd Assistant Agent to the Governor-General, and Mrs. Yate. The tents and baggage was embarked in a couple of the local fishing boats. The horses, sowars and khalassis, etc., were all left at Pasni to be called for on our return. Lieutenant-Colonel Eullerton examined the wounded prisoners and we sailed at 1-30 p.m. for Sheinal Bandar which was reached at 5 P-M. Inis consists of a long low circular bank facing eastwards ending in a high mud hill which forms the promontory on the south. There was no village visible, but we saw some men on the shore. There were no boats. 700 900 1,000 300 800 2,000 2,500 2,000 10,00024 \ We called in at Gwadur at ]1 p.m. for the post, and went on again at once. Tuesday, 31st December 1901. —Jiwani, 47 miles from Gwadur, 293 miles from Karachi. British territory thus extends to almost exactly £00 miles west of Karachi. Arrived at 7-30 A.H., and anchored about a mile out and went on shore, accompanied by Colonel Pullerton, Khan Bahadur Moula Bakhsh, Sardar Sir Nauroz Khan and Mir Kustam Khan, Gitchki. We were met on the beach by Mir Lalla and Sher Muhammad, the headmen of the local tribe, termed Shehzada or Shaikhzada. These people are said to have ori ginally come from Bannu, some seven or eight generations ago. There were about 40 families of these Shehzadas at Jiwani and out of these they provided eight sowars for the Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs’ guard. Another 3 5 of the same tribe are enlisted for the guard from Gabad in Dasht. Jiwani, they said, belonged to the Tump district, and paid revenue at the rate of Rs. 100 per annum through Mir Murad, Gitchki. There was a population of some 60 families of &lt;? Med ” or fishermen belonging to the Rais Baluchis and of Darzadas. These Darzadas seem to be of the Gypsy class similar to the Sharibzadas of Persia, and were originally of Indian origin. The fishermen own ten Batels and also several yekdars or surf boats,fbut pay no taxes. There is no customs contract for Jiwani. The fish caught are taken to Gwadur for sale. Water is procured from some shallow wells in a nullah bed. A hillock above these wells was said to be the site of an ancient fort. On this same hillock were the ruins of what appeared to have been a Musjid. These were formed of two upright slabs of rock some eight feet in height above the ground and two feet thick and two feet deep. Other slabs lay prone, but how these heavy masses of rock were put in position is not known. One part of the village stood on a ridge of conglomerate rock formed entirely of masses of cockle shells and from this these slabs had been cut. .Jiwani had no cultivation, and the village depends for supplies on Gwadur and Kej. It was three stages for laden camels, they said, to Gwadur and nine to Kalatuk in Kej. After leaving Jiwani Gudtar . M ' e crossec ^ over ^ ie to Guettar on the western shore. Here we entered Persian territory, and the first thing was the arrival of a boat to put us under quaran tine and to forbid us to land. We w r ent ashore in the steam launch and found a Mirza Ibrahim, the Persian Customs official with Persian Tufangchis and Mir Barkat Khan, son of Mir Abdul Nabi Khan, Noushirwani of Jask, who met us on the shore. Mirza Ragu Midi Khan, who has charge of all customs from Bundar Abbas to Guettar, is a son of the Naib-ul-Wazarat, formerly Karguzar of Mashhad. He has 25 Tufangchis and 15 Jask levies at Guettar and these are posted at Balm Kalat and other places on the frontier to prevent Kafilahs going to Gwadur. Guettar possesses nine Buggalows and 15 Batels, and the popu lation consists of about J00 families of Baluchis. There are three Banias’ and four Khojahs’ shops. The annual imports are estimated at Rs. 20,000, and the exports at Ils. 22,000, and they expect to increase receipts by closing the road to Gwadur. Wednesday, 1st January 1902. —Charbar. Left Guettar at 2 p.m., and arrived at Charbar at 11 p.m. and anchored for the night. Charbar consists of a village of mat huts around the ruins of a fort built by the Persians. There are 12 Khojahs’and 11 Banias’ shops, and a population of about 300 families of Baluchis. The imports and exports are estimated to value about 1^ lakhs of rupees each. It possesses 14 Buggalows and 7 Batels and exports a good deal of cotton. The Telegraph bungalow consists of a stone building with the office and three sets of quarters on the ground floor and married quarters above. A guard of 50 men of the 5th Bombay Infantry are quartered here. Troops were sent here at the time of Mr. Greaves’ murder in 1898, and have been retained here and at Jask ever since. Leaving Charbar at 10 a.m. we steamed up to Tiz, six or eight miles to the north, and landed there. Tiz consists of a Persian fort built on the top of the hill commanding the entrance to a valley which is now in ruins. Inside up the valley exist the remains of an ancient city. The ground is strewn with stones, broken pottery and glass and these are to be found, it is said, some miles up the valley. The feature of the place is the ancient cemeteries where the graves are cut out of25 z-iy sandstone roclc. These graves are clearly Muhammadan for the reason that they lie north and south, and the body is laid on the western side in a nick covered over by the layer of stones called by Muhammadans &lt;c lahad M . The present village contains about 20 families of “Hot ” Baluchis, who live by making matting. With reference to the importation of arms, it appears that the Persian customs officials are only posted at Task, Charbar and Guettar, and that no watch whatever is kept on the little ports and creeks along the coast between those places, such as Galag, Sadech, Rabseh, Bir, Kir, Sirgan and Tank. Native crafts can run across from, Muscat and land arms and ammunition at any of those places and do do so. The officers of the Indo-European Telegraph Department tell me that from Jask to Gwadur the yearly increase in the number of Martini rifles and car bines owned by the Baluchis is surprising, and that some of the Chiefs possess Lee-Metford magazine rifles. These Chiefs and Headmen all tell you that these arms were obtained from Muscat and brought across by Native craft, and that there was no difficulty whatever in purchasing arms at Muscat. One officer personally saw a lot of 20 rifles and 10 boxes of ammunition, apparently landed at a small coast port called Tunk, being conveyed upcountry by the Chiefs of Gaih and Kasirkand, and the men conveying these arms made no secret of the matter. It is difficult to estimate the number of rifles brought into Makran each year, but the fact that the followers of the Chiefs and Head men are now armed chiefly with rifles where formerly matchlocks were only used, shows that the number must be pretty considerable. Thursday, 2nd January 1002 .— Muscat, 150 miles from Charbar. Arrived at 10-30 a.m. Captain Cox, the Political Agent, came off and took us ashore to the Consulate. Not being within the limits of my own jurisdiction, my flag was not flown on the Patrick Stewart. No salute was fired by the Sultan, and no visits were interchanged. The Sultan was invited by Captain Cox to come to tea to meet me, but asked to he excused owing to the Bamzan fast. On enquiring into the arms and ammunition import question I found that, according to the treaties with England of 1891 and France of 1844, no articles whatever are prohibited from importation into Muscat, and the dealers in arms can and do send orders to Europe for any amount of arms and ammunition. These arms are shipped from England and France by the regular monthly steamers of the Strick Line trading with the Persian Gulf. The Muscat dealers have a license from the Sultan, but they pay no fees beyond the customs import duty of 6 per cent, ad valorem and half a dollar on each arm in addition. The value of the annual customs dues on arms and ammuni tion to the Sultan is valued by Captain Cox at 40,000 dollars or Rs. 60,000 per annum. In the Muscat Trade Report for 1901, the total value of arms and ammuni tion imported into Muscat during 1900-1901 is given at dollars 9,97,730 or, at Rs. 1^ to the dollar, Ks. 14,96,595, or in round figures 15 lakhs of rupees. No arms are shown in the returns as exported to foreign countries, but it is mentioned in paragraph 15 of the Muscat Report for 1900-1901, that, out of 25,000 arms taken out of Muscat during the year, the greater part have gone to markets in the Gulf. These arms are cleared at Muscat for ports on the Batina Coast and once outside the Muscat harbour there is nothing whatever to prevent them running across to harbours on the Makran Coast. The only restriction against the export of arms to foreign countries is a notice posted up in the Muscat Custom- liouse announcing the fact that the import of arms is prohibited in Persia, Baluchistan, etc., and dealers are prohibited from selling arms to buyers from those places. The latter easily evade this order by getting local men to make their purchases for them. I inspected a dealer’s shop and found it supplied, not only with Martinis, but with Lee-Metfords, which were selling at Rs. 137 each with a 100 rounds of ammunition. Martini-Henri rifles are now imported by the French trader Guguyer, for the Arab dealers, at a cost of only Rs. 33 each. 1043 F D.V 26 Friday, 3rd January 1902—On board the Indian Government Telegraph Ship Patrick Steicart. We left Muscat a little before midnight on route to Pasni. Saturday, 4th January Pasni, 250 miles from Muscat.— Arrived at Pasni at 4 p.m. and at once commenced to embark the horses. This was not completed till 7 p.m owing to the difficulty of getting the animals into the country boats. We only had two of these boats, and each boat could only take nine horses at a trip. The horses had to be led out into the sea and then up a staging (which theA; Stexcart had brought out on purpose from Kara chi) out of the water on to the top of the side of the boat, and from this they had to jump down into the bottom of the boat. Each boat had to make two trips for the horses and sowars, and then return for the prisoners, wounded and baggage, consequently all were not on board till after midnight. The total number of men embarked amounted to— Prisonevs taken at Nodiz 75 liuards to prisoners taken at Nodiz . . . » • 20 Military, sick and wounded under Lieutenant Corry, R.E. . . 18 Total . 113 In addition to all tbe kbalassis and others who came with the camp and were here re-embarked. Sunday, the 5th January 1902. —We left Pasni at 1 a.m. and at 8 p.m. anchored off Pur to disembark Telegraph stores. Mr. Thoy, the Telegraph signaller, located at Pasni, during my stay in Kej, was brought on with us to open out a Telegraph office at Sonmiani during my stay in Las Bela. Monday, the 6th January 1902. —Sonmiani. Arrived at sunrise. Tbe horses and baggage were out of the ship into the Batels, or country fishing boats, by 10 a.m., but the wind failed, and none of these boats got to shore till 4 p.m. We, ourselves, started in the steam launch at 10-15 and did not get to shore till 12-30, so far out had the ship to lie. We landed some three miles to tbe west of the village of Sonmiani, where the present harbour is, and there found tbe Jam of Las Bela and Captain Winter, the Political Agent, waiting to receive us. The launch was brought up near enough to the bank to permit of our walking ashore on a plank. At all other places there was no plank, and we had to be carried ashore. The Jam was accompanied by his younger brother Sardar Mir Abdul Karim Khan, and the following officials, headmen, etc.:— Officials. Haji Ishak, wakil of the Las Bela State. Shaikh Ghulam Husain, Mir Munshi to the Jam. Mir Jangi Khan, Naib of. Sonmiani. Munshi iiahim Bakhsh, Head Naib of Liari. Ileidmen, etc. Shaikh Jumman, Paria Mans of the Shaikh tribe with his son. Choger Khan, Paria Muns of the Jamot tribe with 3 Motabars. Haji Dosu, guardian of Pavia Muns of the Runja tribe with 5 Motabars. Daria Khan, Paria Muns of Angaria tribe with 2 Motabars. Daria Khan, Paria Muns of Burra tribe with 4 Motabars. Pini Ladha, Paria Muns of Gunga tribe with 2 Motabars. Faizu, Paria Muns of Sabra tribe with 1 Motabar. Manthar, Faria Muns of Achra tribe.

Pir Nabi Baksh of Uthal. Saiyad Ibrahim Shah and four other Saiyad Motabars of Welpat.27 T/( f Tho azir, Khan Bahadur Ahmad A'ar Khan, was unable to be present owing to illness. We ro( le from the landing place at Dam to the bungalow, which had been prepared for us. Here the escort of 100 men of the 12t,h Infantry from Pislun were drawn took leave. up, men ot the Bombay and after inspecting them the Jam Tuesday, 7th^ January 7P02.—Sonmiani. Halt.—The population of Sonmiam vdlage is said to be about 300 families, of which 150 are Banias, 15 Khojahs and the remainder Koli ftshermen. The houses are all of mud wi win s a s acmg the sea on the roof. Scindi is the language spoken. Water is procured from shallow wells. It is sweet but muddy. The sea traffic as diminished owing to the silting up of the former harbour, and most of the communication with Karachi is now by land. The Banias say that the imports and exports still amount to the value of something like eight and four lakhs respectively. The village possesses one JJangi, or sea-going boat, and 40 Batels, or fishing boats. The customs dues are collected by the State officials direct, so what they amount to is unknown, but the rates levied are said to vary from 6 to 11 per cent, ad valorem, different articles being charged for at different rates. ^ Wednesday , 8th January 1902. —Shaikh Raj, 19 miles by the road following the telegraph to the east of the Siranda Lake—7 miles out are some tombs. They lie north and south and are presumably Muhammadan. They are built in two or three layers of carved sandstone, but there is no inscription on them, and Moula Bakhsh, who visited them, is of opinion that they are not above ground tombs. He thinks that the body was buried in the ground, and the superstructure was puiely ornamental. The lower layer has perforated stone sides and could not so, Moula Bakhsh thinks, have been built to contain the body. The two upper layers now open at the ends are filled with sand, but were not meant, he thinks, for coffins. W e struck off the main road and went across country to the west of the Siranda Lake where some boats, called “oris,” had been sent out for us. The lake was very shallow and full of pelicans, flamingoes and wild fowl, but it was impossible to take up places and get the birds driven. The extent was too vast. The water was very shallow and full of creeks and backwaters hidden in tama risk jungle, and the boats were of comparatively little use. 9th January 1902. —Shaikh Raj. Halt.—Shaikh Raj contains only five or six houses ; of these only two are at present occupied by a Khojah and his dependants. . The people apparently all live scattered about in huts built of tamarisk twiggs. Water procurable from shallow wells in the bed of a nullah; the 'water is muddy and brackish. Friday, 10th January 1902. —Uthal, 12 miles.-—The road for the first half passes through sandy barren country, after that there is a good deal of cultiva tion all in fields surrounded by embankments to catch rain water. At the 10th mile is the shrine of Tajanturel, JPir of the Khojahs of Las Bela. The building consists of a room containing a bedstead and a picture of Hayrafc Abbas and is. surrounded by houses occupied only at the annual festival. Uthal contains some 210 houses, of which half belong to Hindus, 25 to Khoja.hs and the remainder to other Muhammadans. The Hindus here gave us a display of fireworks, the same as the Hindus did at Sonmiani. Water good from wells. Saturday, 11th January -ZP&lt;9£.—Wayara, 19 miles.—Cultivation extended for some five miles out. At the 2nd mile some old mud ruins mark the site of an ancient fort called Kalikot. The road ran through sandy cactus covered country all the way till the Sukkan nullah was crossed at the 18th mile. Wayara contains eight or nine huts inhabited by Shaikhs. Water good from wells about 75 feet in depth. All the cultivators live in huts in their fields. 12lh January 1902. —Pir Tihara, 9 miles.—Road through jungle of kangar trees and cactus bushes all the way from the Wayara nullah close to camp till we came to the large cemetery known as Tihara Pir. There are hundreds of graves which have been covered with small round stones and in28 plnces surrounded by a round stone wall. There are only two buildings—one the walls of a mausoleum said to have been that of the Chief of the Banja tribe who formerly ruled at Las Bela, and from whom the present Jamots took the country ; the other is the fallen debris of a building comprised of light-coloured sandstone pillars. This is said to have covered the grave of Ibraham Gunga, the tribe who ruled Las Bela before the Runjas: an inscribed stone is said to be buried in the fallen debris. The village consists of 20 huts of Gadras and Jamots, who came out to meet us accompanied by the Jam’s Naib. Water good from one well; supply plentiful. Mondayi ISth January 1902.—1.^ Bela, 10 miles.—The road ran through cultivation for the first three miles, then through Karrir thorn bush jungle to the village of Gudar and thence along sandy lanes through cultivation till within a mile of Bela where the ground was much cut up by water courses. About two miles from the town of Las Bela I was met by the Jam’s younger brother Mir Abdul Karim Khan, Hafiz.Saifulla Khan, the Tahsildar, and Saiyad Juman Shah and Haji Umar and seven other R.unja Motabirs. The Jam, Kamal Khan, rode in with me, haying met me at Sonmiani and accompanied me throughout. I was also accompanied by Sardar Sir Nauwroz Khan of Kharan who has been with me throughout the tour. On arrival at the Bela bungalow a guard-of-honour of 100 men of the Las Bela Military Police and 21 men of the Lasi Irregular Infantry presented arms and a salute of 13 guns was fired by the Jam’s artillery. The Jam’s son Mir Gbulam Muhammad Khan, aged 5|, accompanied by 6 of the leading priests and Saiyads, 7 Motabirs and 26 officials were present at the bungalow to meet me. Arches were erected, the roads were decorated wdth flags and at night the town was illuminated. As soon as the Jam and bis followers had taken their departure, I and the officers with me paid a visit to the tomb of Sir Robert Sandeman. We found the small garden around the tomb in excellent order and well kept. The trees are now growing up and the place is both quiet and pretty. The solid granite tombstone is perfect and is kept clean and covered by a cloth. The dome erected by the late Jam of Las Bela over the tomb is in good order and the inscriptions, both on the tombstone itself and on the dome above, are in perfect order. 14th January 1902. —Bela. Halt.—Jam Kamal Khan paid me a formal visit at 9 a.m. accompanied by his brother Sardar Mir Abdul Karim Khan and the Wazir, Khan Bahadur Ahmad Yar Khan, an escort of 1 Rasildar and d sowars of the Head-Quarter Levies met the Jam at his palace and accompanied him to the camp. On the Jam’s arrival Captain Ramsay, the 3rd Assistant, met him at the door of the tent, and I received him at the edge of the carpet. Captain Winter, Political Agent, Southern Baluchistan, and Khan Bahadur Moula Bakhsh, Personal Assistant, were also present. A guard-of-honour of 50 rank and file of the 12th Bombay Infantry under a Native officer presented arms on the Jam’s arrival and departure. In the afternoon I visited the “Bet” or mound near Karia Pir to the north-east of the town. This mound is some 300 yards in diameter and is full of broken pottery, glass, bones and ashes. No one knows the history of it. There is another low mound to the south of the town in which a pot full of thin silver coins, about the size of an 8-anna piece, was found some years ago. The Jam showed me some of these coins. They have an inscription' in Kufie characters on both sides. On one coin on the face is the “ Kalima” in a square in the centre. (La ilaha illallahu Muhammad-ur-Rasul-allah) and the names of Muhammad’s successors Abu Bakr, Umar, Usman and Ali in the four corners. On the reverse is Zarb-i-as-Sultan, Abu Sa’id Bahadur Khan Khalla- dullahu Mulkuhu and round the rim is the year in Arabic words 728 A.H. = A.D. 1327. In others of these coins the dies are different, but all appear to belong to the time of Sultan Abu Sa’id of Persia. According to the Jam Persian coins were the current coin in Bela up to the time of the British occu pation. Sind and Persian coins are still to be found in the bazar. In the evening I gave a dinner party to Jam Kamal Khan and his brother Mir Abdul Karim Khan, Sardar Sir Nauwroz Khan of Kharan, the Wazir, Khanx/ r 29 Bahadur Ahmad Yar Khan, Mir Ihrahim Khan and Mir Wali Muhammad Khan, Mengals of Wad, Sardar Gul Muhammad Khan, Muaammadzai of Quetta and some 20 others. After dinner the Jam gave a display of fireworks. Wednesday, 15th January 1902 .—At 9 a.m. I paid a return visit to the Jam accompanied hy Captain Winter, the Political Agent, Lieutenant-Colonel Fullerton, Agency Surgeon, Captain Ramsay, 3rd Assistant, and Khan Bahadur ALoula Bakhsli, Personal Assistant, and escorted hy the Head-Quarter Levies. Khan Bahadur Ahmad Yar Khan, 'Wazir, met meat the camp and escorted me to the town which was decorated with flags and arches. On arrival at the Jam’s palace, Jam Kamal Khan and his brother Mir Abdul Karim Khan met me as I dismounted below the staircase leading up to the reception room : a guard-of-honour of Las Bela Military Police presented arms and a salute of 13 guns was fired by the Las Bela Artil lery on my arrival and departure. At the conclusion of the visit, L inspected the Topkhana,* State offices, Jama Musjid, bazar and school accompanied by the Jam. * One large and three small muzzle loaders manufactured in Bela. One ship’s gun, 2-pounder, belonging to a vessel wrecked near Sonmiani during Jam All Khan’s time. 15th January 1902. —Gundrani, 14 miles.—In the afternoon I marched to Gundrani. About five miles out from the town we passed the Jam’s garden in which the members of the ruling family of the Las Bela State are buried. The most conspicuous among the tombs are those built on raised masonry platforms. On one platform there are three large and one small tombs built up with ornamental yellow sandstone slabs in three or four layers, and surmounted by an upright stone with what was said to be a crown on the top. The stone layers did not contain the body and though looking like above ground tombs they are not so in reality. I mention this as tombs of this pattern have been noted to be above ground tombs and these might be taken to he the same. The names given on the two larger tombs are Jam 'Ali and Jangi Khan. The names on the other two are illegible and no dates are given. Two other tombs built on a platform under a covered building have inscriptions containing the names of Ghulam Shah, Jamot and Bibi Batti Mai Jam Ghulam Shah with Hijra year 1190 (A.D. 1770)- Prom this garden the road cresses the Purali river bed and a rich belt of cultivation on the western bank irrigated from this river known as Welpat. Beyond that lay a tract covered with small stones and a couple of low mounds, evidently the site of some ancient town, were passed. 16th January 1902 .—During the day I inspected the caves situated in the conglomerate cliffs bordering a side ravine on the right hank of the Kud River which here emerges from the hills. All the caves were of the same pattern, consisting of an open verandah in front and a door at the back opening into a room beyond some six or seven feet in height and eight or ten feet square. One verandah had two doorways leading into two separate rooms behind. Some of these rooms had the remains in them of bins of mud and stones apparently built to contain grain. In many cases the verandahs and part of the rooms had gone owing to the wearing away of the face of the cliff, and though the rooms, as a rule, were at no great height, access was difficult and sometimes impossible. There is nothing whatever to show who these dwellings were constructed hy. The name Gundrani is derived from the tomb of a woman of that name higher up the river. 'We returned to Las Bela in the evening. 17th January 1902 .—Las Bela. Halt.—The town of Las Bela contains about 700 houses with a population of about 4,000 souls. The bazar contains 50 or 60 shops, all of which except one belong to Hindu Banias. The imports and exports are said to value about three lakhs a year. The total population of the Las Bela State is estimated at 56,109 hy the Census of 1901, and the revenue at Rs. 2,22,050, but should rise to three lakhs in good years. 18th January 1902 .—Las Bela. Halt.—I held a Darbar in the Resi dency Camp at the bungalow at 3 p.m. to invest Jam Kamal Khan of Las Bela with full powers, subject to certain conditions laid down by the Government of India which the Jam had formally accepted. The Jam30 ■was seated in a chair on my right hand, with Captain Winter, Political Agent, on his right again. Lieutenant-Colonel Fullerton, Agency Surgeon, and Captain Ramsay, Third Assistant, occupied seats of my left. Sardar Sir Nauwroz Khan of Kharan, the Jam’s son Mir Ghulam Muham mad and brother Mir Abdul Karim Khan, Sardar Gul Muhammad, Muham- madzai, Mir Wali Muhammad Khan, Mengal, the AVazir, Khan Bahadur Ahmad Yar Khan and the officials, headmen of tribes, Pir, Saiyads and Motabars of the State to the number of about 100 men were seated on carpets on the floor in the shamiana. All others stood outside. The Wazir opened the proceedings by reading a report on the result of his five years’ management of the State. I then made a speech investing the Jam with full powers, subject to the conditions imposed, and concluded by conferring khillats on the Jam, his brother and son, the Wazir, Tashildar, Mir Munshi and Vakil. The Jam at the conclusion spoke a few words of thanks and this brought the proceedings to a close. The escort of the 12th Bombay Infantry presented arms on my arrival and departure. Later on I inspected the Miltary Police lines and the gaol, accompanied by Captain Winter, Political Agent, Lieutenant-Colonel Fullerton, Agency Surgeon, and Khan Bahadur Ahmad Yar Khan, the Wazir. In the evening I gave a dinner to the Jam and all the headmen of his State. Sardar Sir Nauroz Khan of Kharan, Mir Wali Muhammad Khan, Mengal, and some 70 odd officials and headmen of the State sat down. At the conclusion the Jam made a short speech returning thanks for the entertain ment. 19lh January 1902. —Mangia, 10 miles.—We left Las Bela at 3 p.m. The Jam and the Wazir accompanied me. A salute of 13 guns was fired by the Jam’s artillery. The road ran through waste ground the latter half of the way. Water is obtained from the Purali River about half a mile Lorn the camp. The stream is about 35 feet in width and a foot in depth. The water is good and the bed is full of tamarisk jungle. Mangia village contains only eight huts of the Mangia tribe. 20th January 1502—Sheh, 18 miles.—The road crossed to the right bank of the Purali River and ran through “pat” and waste land ail the way till within two miles of Shell. At the 10th mile I left the road and turned. off. to a pool in the river where the water had been bunded up for irrigation and from there I followed the irrigation channel through cultivation all the way into camp. Shell consists of a thana and two shops and the quarters of the Naib for the district. The zamindars all live out in their fields; water is brought from the Purali River.

At three places along this road at the 6th, 10th and 14th mile we came across the carved sandstone tombs that are such a peculiar feature of this country. The first consisted of only four or five tombs, the second had eight or ten, but the third is a large cemetery full of these tombs and different varieties are to be seen. That they are Muhammadan tombs is clear as they lie north and south and some of them have Musalman names, such as Haji Ishak, Malagh Jaru, Ramzan Rangu, Jassi Setu, Toku Setu, Isa Dazu. There are no dates and no inscriptions, nothing but the bare names, and this only on some. The general feature of these tombs is the carved slabs of sandstones alternately laid flat and on edge, thus forming hollow spaces which look like sarcophagi and give the idea that these spaces were meant to contain bodies, but so far as I could judge this was not the case. The lowest tier on the ground is often open, formed of carved slabs, say four to six inches thick, set on edge and cut out into arches. Above this is a flat horizontal slab. Then came four more slabs set on edge forming the sides and ends of what looks like a sarcophagus, but the space inside is so narrow that nobody could have been laid in it, at any rate not flat on its back. In some a corpse might have been put in on its side, but there were no bones or anything to be found to suggest this. Above the second layer sometimes came a third and sometimes simply a succession of slabs, one on the top of the other, each smaller than the last and culminating by an upright stone to the north surmounted by what apparently was intended to represent a crown. Mr. Vogel, Archseological Surveyor for the Punjab Circle, wrote to me on 22nd June 1901, describing his inspection of certain tombs of this description at a place called Hinidan, four marches up the Hab River from Karachi. These tombs are described by him as follows : — “ They consist of sandstone slabs plainly carved, built up so as to form sarcophagi placed one above the other. Now the above ground form of burial is, as far as I have been able to ascei’tain, quite unknown in any other part of India. Another curious feature of these tombs is the top slab on which, in many cases, the figure of a horseman armed with lance, sword and shield is carved. Yet there can be no doubt that the tombs are Muhammadan. ’* The Las Bela Vakil, Haji Ishak, stated that he had visited these tombs at Hinidan and that he had himself seen the bones and skull of a man in them. I myself could find no such bones in the present case. The names on the tombs are badly engraved and not in keeping with the rest of the carving, but the spelling of the word Malagh would give the idea of Arab origin. It is curious that these tombs are all on the side of the road and away from any traces of former habitation. 25th January 1902. —Karachi, 17 miles.—The road crossed the bed of the Hab River and ran through sandy waste country all the way in.

My Lord, Tehran, November 26, 1896. SINCE the sudden removal of the Sadr Azam from office on the 24th November I have been so constantly occupied with visits to the Shah and others that I have had no time to write a despatch on the situation. I therefore asked Captain Sykes, who was acquainted with the state of affairs and with the persons chiefly concerned, to let me have a Memorandum on the subject for transmission to your Lordship. I have now the honour to inclose this Memorandum, which gives a substantially correct account of what has occurred. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. DUKAND. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum on the Change of Ministry in Persia. BEEOBE proceeding to describe the actual facts that are now taking place, a short reference to the causes which have led up to this apparently sudden crisis may not be out of place. At the time of the Shah’s death, aided by the unanimity of both the Russian and English Legations, the Sadr Azam was able, not only to forestall any pretender to the Throne, but also to prevent any serious disorders in the provinces adjacent to the capital. In consequence the new Shah, upon his arrival at Tehran, leaned so entirely upon his Premier’s advice, that that official became more and more arrogant, and conse quently unpopular, as, instead of gaining adherents among the Shah’s retinue, he refused to distribute any of the important offices among them, insisting upon the paramount necessity of keeping everything in his own hands, no one else being, in his opinion, sufficiently capable or trustworthy. The foremost personage who came under this category was his Highness the Earman Earma, who is, at once, the son-in-law and the brother-in-law of the Shah. He happened to be at Kerman when the news of the assassination was received; and, although his province was quiet, the Sadr Azam tried every expedient to keep him away from Tehran, and when he finally arrived, treated him very coldly and removed him from his Governorship, which was given to the Na'ib-i-Sultaneh. These acts provoked the Earman Earma, who aspired to the post of War Minister, which high office is generally held by a member of the Royal Family; so that, from being an adherent of the Sadr Azam’s party, he threw in his lot with the other malcontents, whose leader he became. During the summer and autumn the Shah’s mind was constantly being poisoned against his Chief Minister, even the depreciation of silver being laid to his charge. The latter did not realize his position, and, although most seriously warned on more than one occasion by Her Britannic Majesty’s Minister, he declared that, even if he resigned, he would return to office with greater power than before. Secure in his fancied inassailable position, he insisted that the Shah should sign all State papers put before him without demur; while, as for his enemies, he declared even a few days before his fall that they were utterly weak and beneath contempt. [1626 r—3]2 It should be mentioned that the Russian Minister supported the Sadr Azam m this high-handed attitude, and, consequently, the warnings given by Her .Britannic Maiesty’s Representative were not taken in good part, or not altogether so. On the morning of the 24th November the bolt fell, and the Sadr Azam informed that he was dismissed from office, and must remain in Ins garden until tne further pleasure of the Shah should be made known. , , w ^ He replied that he was only too anxious to be relieved of his ofhce, and that would not “stir hand or foot” so long as his safety and property were At the same time, he immediately informed Her Britannic Majesty s Minister of what had occurred, while deprecating any action on the part of either Legation to reinstate him, as any such attempt would, he was convinced, cost him his Inn. Her Britannic Majesty’s Minister, upon receipt of the news telegraphed it to the •several Consular Offices, and sent the Nawab to visit the fallen Minister _ His next care was to inform the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia of what had occurred, and to request him to be prepared, should the Shah require a large This Mr. Rabino expressed himself as both able and willing to furnish, while he had alreadv notified his branches not to draw bills on Tehran for the present. The Nawab returned about 2 p.m., with the information that the Sadr Azam ha been required to surrender his official insignia, and had been offered the Governors ip of Hamadan or Kermanshah. m m/uw arm Upon his refusal, he was ordered to quit Tehran with the least possible delay, and Being ^unable to trust any member of his own retinue, he asked that a Legation, &lt;c a-holam,” might be placed at his disposal, which was immediately done. In addition, he requested that Her Britannic Majesty’s Minister should concert, with Russia’s Representative, some measures to insure his safety, in accordance with, which request, Sir Mortimer Durand called upon M. de Butzow, and agreed that both Ministers should approach the Shah for that purpose. _ , In the evening I received a visit from his Highness the Barman Farina s Confidential Secretary, who, after narrating the various incidents of the day requested that Sir Mortimer Durand should call upon the new Minister tor Foreign Affairs, the Mushir-i-Dowleh, as soon as possible. • ^ He urged that by adopting this course, the Legation would naturally gam the credit of being the first to recognize the new order, while the Farman Farma and his party would derive considerable benefit from so prompt a recognition. To this Sir Mortimer Durand agreed, and, after sending his congratulations, expressed his strongest desire that the Sadr Azam should be generously treated, which was met by the fullest assurances that such was the intention of all parties. _ At the same time, it was requested that the Farman Farma should be mforme that the two Ministers only requested an audience of the Shah, in order to insure good treatment to the fallen Minister, and that no attempt would be made to urge that His Majesty’s decision should be reconsidered. ^ , At an early hour on the morning of the 25 th November, the Far man Farma s Secretary again visited me with the request that Her Britannic Majesty s Minis er should visit the Mushir-i-Dowleh before being received in audience by the Shah. This, he explained, was advisable, as otherwise it would be supposed that the new Ministry was only accepted after the audience, which fact would lower its 1 He left with the promise that the Minister would accede to his request, and, at the same time, he repeated his assurances as to the safety of the Sadr Azam. Her Britannic Majesty’s Minister, accordingly, called upon the Mushir-i-Dowleh, who was much gratified at his visit, and even more so upon receiving the assurance that, owing to his great experience of European Courts and perfect knowledge of French, his appointment was considered most appropriate by all the Members of the Corps Diplomatique who had expressed their views on the subject. The Shah received both the British and Russian Ministers together m the afternoon, and, in reply to M. de Butzow’s expression of regret at the fall of a Minister, who had maintained such good relations between Persia and the Powers, His Majesty, with great dignity, said that it was the Shah who. was the friend of foreign Powers, and that all his servants were but instruments of his will, who did not affect the Imperial policy. , . 5 Acceding to a last request of the Sadr Azam, Her Britannic Majesty s Minister3 ■2/ 8 allowed Dr. Scully, Acting Physician to the Legation, who is shortly leaving for Isfahan, to commence his jonrney a few days earlier, and accompany the ex-Premier to Kum, which is to be his retreat in exile. Any forecast as to how the new Ministry will succeed in their difficult task would he premature, so I will conclude by giving a list of the chief appointments: His Highness the Farman Parma, Minister of War, and also probably Governor of Tehran and of Kerman. His Excellency the Mukber-i-Dowleh, Minister of Pinance, of the Interior, and Master of the Mint. He also nominally retains the telegraphs. His Highness the Mulk Ara, Minister of Commerce. It is stated that the Amin-i-Dowleh, who is at present Governor of Azerbaijan, is returning to Tehran, where he will probably fill some important office. (Signed) P.

ASIA. CONFIDENTIAL. 2627 Sir M. Durand to the Marquess of Salisbury.—(Received December 28.) (No. 65.) My Lord, Tehran, November 25, 1896. I HAVE the honour to forward, for your Lordship’s information, a letter addressed to me by Captain Sykes, Consul in Kerman, regarding the services rendered to Her Majesty’s Government by His Koyal Highness the Firman Farma. There is, I think, no doubt that the Firman Farma is at present thoroughly friendly to us, and under our influence. This is mainly due to the remarkable personal ascen dancy gained over him by Captain Sykes, who deserves much credit for the manner in which he has made His Royal Highness trust him and follow his advice. Now that the Sadr Azam has been deprived of office, the Firman Farma is probably the most powerful man iu Persia, and the value of his friendship and support is very great. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. DURAND. Inclosure in No. 1. Captain Sykes to Sir M. Durand. (No. 5.) ^ Tehran, November 20, 1896. IN accordance with your instructions, I have the honour to lay before you the following information respecting the services rendered to Her Britannic Majesty’s Government by His Highness Abdul Hossein Mirza, commonly known as the Firman Farma. It is now nearly four years since His Highness was appointed Governor of Kerman, and shortly after his arrival in the district I had the good fortune to make his acquaintance. Being much struck with his courtesy and unmistakable friendliness, I was very glad to accept an invitation to be his guest, and to travel with him. After being treated with the greatest kindness for more than a week, I left His Highness, but received a most pressing invitation to renew my experiences in Beluchistan during the following winter. After my return to India, this invitation was repeated by every post, and such was the tenor of it that the Government of India deputed me to proceed to Beluchistan with instructions to strengthen my influence over His Highness, and at the same time to inquire into and arrange some cases affecting British Indian subjects. Upon meeting the Firman Farma at Bampur, I was treated with courtesy so marked that it was evident to all the assembled Beluchi Chiefs that His Highness was the well-wisher of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government. Furthermore, every Notable and local Governor was sent to me with instructions to furnish all the information I required, and, in consequence, I was enabled to fill in the large lacunas that still existed in our knowledge of that remote country—such an opportunity having never occurred before. I travelled with the Firman Farma for the entire distance to Kerman, where, after satisfactorily arranging the cases affecting British subjects, we temporarily parted, as His Highness was recalled to Tehran. Upon reaching the Legation some weeks later, I found that Her Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was most favourably impressed by the Firman Farma, who was equally emphatic in his assurances of devotion to Her Britannic Majesty’s Government as he had been in the wilds of Beluchistan. [1626 r—2]2 Upon returning to Tehran at the end of 1894, I was presented to His Majesty the Shah, then the Yali Ahd, who was most cordial in his reception, owing to the Firman Farma’s influence. . During the summer of the following year His Highness was reappointed to Kerman, and thenceforward my position as Consul was most enviable, as 1 merely had to express my wishes for them to be carried out, while so evident was the friendship of His Highness for Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, that all the district officials and local Chiefs invariably came to see me when they visited Kerman, and told me that such were their instructions. _ Furthermore, the fact that His Highness has invested a considerable sum ot money in British securities means that he is hound to our side, as he cannot believe but that Her Britannic Majesty’s Government would confiscate his property in England, were ne to play us false. . I will pass over the institution of bread tickets for the poor at Kerman, and move on to the events connected with the recant Perso-Beluch Commission. _ . Upon the presentation by Her Britannic Majesty’s Legation of a note summaiizmg the previous correspondence on the subject and demanding a Commission, the Sadi Azam wrote to the Firman Farma attaching a copy of the note, and asked toi infor mation. This and all subsequent letters His Highness showed me requesting my assistance m framing the replies. In consequence, the Shah finally grasped the true facts of the case, which had been grossly misrepresented, but yet His Majesty was not inclined to disburse the necessary funds for a Commission, so that it appeared as if matters were at a deadlock. Fortunately, however, at this juncture, a rumour was heard at Kerman to the effect that the Mashkel date groves and even Talk was being raided by the Koasherwanis, and of this the Firman Farma took full advantage. He wrote me a stiff official letter requesting me to stop these raids, that caused so much loss to the subjects of His Imperial Majesty. In reply, while deploring the facts, I pointed out that the sole remedy lay in having n Commission. Both letters were forwarded to Tehran, and produced such an effect upon the Shah that he immediately agreed to the proposals of Her Britannic Majesty’s Legation. Upon my appointment to the Commission some days after the Persian Representative had left Kerman for the frontier, His Highness, at considerable inconvenience to himself, provided me with all my transport, for which he declined to accept any payment. At the same time he dispatched messengers to every stage along my route, so that I found provisions and forage awaiting my arrival, and, as a result, the distance to Kohuk of between 500 and 600 miles, was accomplished in forty days. During the progress of the Commission, both the Representative of Persia, his assistant, and the Governor of Beluchistan received frequent letters to the effect that they should avoid showing any hostility to the proposals of the British Commissioner, and, as a consequence, the demarcation was concluded in less than a month. A reference to the pages of the Scistan Mission will show with what difficulty, and at what cost, other sections of this frontier were defined, whereas in the present case objections were only raised pro formd in order to satisfy the Governor of Beluchistan. In conclusion, His Highness is now at Tehran, where, owing to the fact that he is at once the son-indaw and the brother-in-law of the reigning Shah, his position is but little inferior to that of the Sadr Azam. In consequence, moreover, of his attachment to Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, the Legation can obtain much useful information, together with that personal support that is of the highest importance in the case of the present Shah. His Highness’ greatest ambition is to receive an English decoration, and I venture to hope that the foregoing account of his services may prove that he has merited some such special mark of Her Majesty’s favour.

I HAVE the honour to transmit a Persian news’ diary from the 23rd October to the 23rd November, which has been drawn up by Lieutenant-Colonel Picot. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M DURAND. Inclosure in No. 1. Summary of News from October 23 to November 23, 1896. REFERRING to the diary of the 16th March to the 16th April, where mention is made of the depreciation of the copper money; the measures taken by His Majesty the Shah have resulted in the withdrawal from circulation of copper coin to the value of 80,000/. The Imperial Bank of Persia has received instructions to continue the purchase till a fair working value has been established between that metal and silver, and it is expected that a total expenditure of 120.000/. will effect this purpose. Silver money continues very scarce, though the wdhte metal is being coined as rapidly as the indifferent machinery at the mint will allow. The Imperial Bank of Persia is being solely employed for the import of the bar silver. The position of this bank has much improved of late. Its ability to raise large sums of money at short notice, and its readiness of resource, came as a surprise to the Persian Government, and has greatly added to its prestige throughout the country. The Government finds itself more and more dependent on the bank, whilst the people are showing their confidence by dealing largely in its notes, which hitherto have been a drug in the market. In Teheran, all interest during the last month has been centered on the position of the Sadr Azam and the intrigues of the Court. The Firman Firma, it would appear, was much disappointed at the distrust shown towards him by the Sadr Azam, and the refusal of the latter to give him the post of Minister of War in the place of the N alb- es-Sultaneh. This developed into active hostility when the Prime Minister appointed his son-in-law, the Sardar Akram, a man of no special merit or ability, to the executive command of the army, retaining the portfolio of the Ministry in his own hands. The near relationship existing between the Firman Firma and the Shah gave him great personal influence, and enabled him to unite the two most important parties of the State then intriguing for office. The Sadr Azam had unfortunately alienated the Tabreez Court officials, who had not met with that recognition at his hands which their long service in Azerbaijan with the Valiahd had led them to expect, and had been long in direct opposition to a strong faction in Teheran amongst which, were to loe found the brothers of the late Shah, the Amin-ed-Dowleh, and many of the chief Ministers. To add to his difficulties, financial troubles had supervened consequent on the refusal of the provincial Governors to forward the year’s revenue to Teheran, whilst the want of confidence always shown towards him by the Shah had gone on steadilv increasing since his accession, A deadlock naturally occurred, and when the Sadr Azam presented the Shah with an ultimatum demanding the unconditional support of His Majesty, the latter seems to have had no alternative but to remove him from office [1626 r—1]2 The Sadr Azam received Ms dismissal on the 23rd November, and the various Ministries wMchlm then Tad been solely directed by him, were conferred on members of the Tabreez and Teheran parties aforementioned. The following appointments have already been made public : Mushir-nd-Dowleh, Foreign Affairs. Mukber-ud-Dowleh, Interior with Treasury and Mint. Firman Firma, War. Mulk Ara, Justice and Commerce. The combination may prove satisfactory in so far as British interests arc con cerned the Firman Firma kd the Mukher-ud-Dowleh probably being om two best friends in Persia. The Firman Firma is thought to be the strongest member of the Cabinet. Whether the Tabreez officials will be satisfied with chen . c distribution of place seems doubtful. Certain of the higher officials have been omitted altogether, and as their accord with those of Teheran seems to have had no stronger basis than determination to upset the Prime Minister, fmthei intrigue and comphoationsjnay^anse.has received of fighting between revolutionary Armenian parties at Van and the Turkish troops, to whom a determined resistance was odei - The Armenians finally escaped to Persian territory, where they will swell the already large number of their countrymen who have taken refuge at Salmas and the neigh ^r Aarim.—The w hich, for the past year have prevailed at Shuster and Ahwaz have been followed by the removal of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh and the Saad-ul-Mulk, Governors of Luristan and Arahistan.

The Sadr Azam has no powerful friends and many enemies. He is popular among the poorer classes and the Mullahs, and is doing his best to prevent any rising among them. His immediate execution would probably follow any such movement. I have arranged to see the Shah to-day, with the TLussian Minister, to try and secure honourable treatment for the Sadr Azam. I think that the new Government is very satisfactorily constituted. The Firman Farma is War Minister, and the Mukhber-ed-Dowleh is Minister of the Interior with charge of the Treasury. They are our best friends in Persia, and have both considerable administrative capacity. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh, who was formerly Ambassador at Constantinople, is the new Foreign Minister. The change gives some possibility of reforms, and increases our influence, and unless disturbances occur, our reasons for regretting it will, I think, be purely personal. The Firma Farma is at present the most powerful member of the party, and he is, I believe, entirely with us. [1626 p—1][This Document is the Property of Her Britannic Majesty's Government.] NO. 7 .

His fall may very possibly occur, and this might cause very great excite ment and some disorder. The combination is formed of some of the most important officials in Tehran, some Princes of the Kajar family, and the officials who followed the Shah from Tabriz. The Shah is very much under their influence. The Sadr Azam complains to me that he no longer enjoys the confidence of the Shah, who thwarts him, and that he has no officials in whom he can trust. He now proposes to ask that the Shah should entirely abstain from interference in public affairs, and should give him full executive powers. I have warned the Sadr Azam against pressing humiliating conditions on the Shah, and have urged him to be careful, but he seems certain that the Shah will yield to his wishes. No. 2. Sir M.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith a Persian diary, from the 27th September to the 23rd October, which has been drawn up by Mr. Wyndham. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. DURAND. Inclosure in No. 1. Diary of Persian Affairs from September 27 to October 23, 1896, by Mr. Wyndham. DURING the past month no particular events of importance have occurred. Indeed, the Central Government appears too weak and timid to take any action, although from nearly every part of the country accounts of misrule, or rather of no rule at all, are received. The discontent is very general, and in the capital it is increased by the presence of the Shah’s suite from Tabriz, who came here expecting office, and have for the most part been disappointed. But no connected action is taken on the part of-the people, partly because the strength of the tribal leaders was thoroughly broken by the late Shah, partly because—and this is scarcely an exaggeration—there are no Persians who thoroughly trust each other. It is for this reason, to a great extent, that Government organization is so weak, and that the Sadr Azam has to bear, with the necessary results, nearly the whole burden of administration on his own shoulders. The Shah himself is feeble in health and ignorant, and does not command, as his father did, the respect of the people. Popular songs are sung in the streets of Tehran, describing him as a nurserymaid, and as “Sister Muzaffar,” and an appeal to the people, said to be by the pen of Malkum Khan, formerly Minister in London, and now living in Paris, in favour of a more liberal Government, is being disseminated throughout the country. From Khorassan, from Kerman, from Ears and Luristan, come the same reports of anarchy. The Governor-General of Meshed is reported helpless in the hands of the priests; the tribes on the Beluch frontier are refusing to pay taxes, saying that they do not believe the Shah has been enthroned, and the nomads are still pillaging near Shiraz, instigated, it is hinted, by the Deputy-Governor of the Province. When the new Governor of Fars arrived on the frontier, he was met, it is said, by an influential deputation, who told him he had better return; if he had come to govern, they had had enough of Governorship under the Rukm-ed-Dowleh ; if he had come for taxes, they had no money. The assailant of Mr. Tanfield is now confined in the Shah’s prison in Tehran, but it is characteristic of the weakness of the Government that they dare not let the fact of his imprisonment be made public for fear of disturbances on the part of the Mullahs. An officer of the Japanese army, Colonel Fukushima, who has studied and travelled in Europe, has lately passed through Persia and Transcaspia. He did [1626 /—l]2 not appear at all impressed with the organization of the Russians in Central Asia. He said that the officers were bad, and that the discipline was lax, and that the towns were unhealthy and decimated with fever. He reported that the bridge over the Oxus was in a very bad condition, and would be practically useless in time of war, and that little work was being done on the line to prolong it beyond Samar kand, ' the Russians apparently concentrating their efforts on the Siberian Railway.

WITH reference to your Lordship’s telegram No. 46 and to Mr. Wyndham’s answer, I have the honour to report that in compliance with your Lordship’s instructions I have not pressed the claim for compensation in the Tanfield case. I had an interview with the Sadr Azam before I left Tehran a fortnight ago. He described at length his difficulties with the Shah and with Persian officials, and I told him he could rely on the support and sympathy of the Legation. The Sadr Azam informed me he had received from the Persian Minister an account of his interview with your Lordship regarding the Tanfield case. He said he wished to delay removing the Governors in the Karun for a month, and to this I agreed. The Sadr Azam credited himself with having imprisoned Sadik on the complaint of the Legation without an inquiry. I objected to this statement, and said that I had throughout urged that the offender should only be punished after conviction. He replied that he had no doubt that Sadik was guilty. He told me that as regards the question of compensation, if it were necessary he would pay the money himself, or compel the Governors to pay it after their arrival in Tehran. He begged me to relieve him of this payment, and I told him I would see what could be done in the matter. After the removal of the Governors, provided that the removal is serious, and that assurances are given that they will not be employed during the remainder of their term of Governorship, I propose to tell the Sadr Azam that your Lordship will remit the payment as a special personal favour. The matter may be regarded as settled if the Sadr Azam fulfils his engagements, but I fear that British merchants will not look upon the settlement as satisfactory. Sykes, who is staying here, tells me that the situation on the Karun is very serious. While he was at Shuster a volley w r as fired at the steamer, and Englishmen are constantly threatened. He thinks there is likely to be further trouble, as, in consequence of the outrages on the “ Malamir ” and on Mr. Tanfield, there is now a general belief that Englishmen can be maltreated with impunity.

Meshed .—Five natives of the Tabas and Turbat-i-Haidai’i districts who were accused of being Babis were recently imprisoned by the Governor of the latter place. They were denounced as infidels by some Mujtaheds who were passing through Turbat-i-Haidari and were dragged out of prison and stoned to death by a mob which had collected. The Governor-General of Khorassan has not taken any steps to punish the perpetrators of this deed, notwithstanding a peremptory order for their punishment sent by the fcfadr Azam at the command of the Shah. The Karguzar at Meshed is constantly complaining to the Central Government of the Governor-General’s weakness and apathy, and declares that he is powerless to settle cases between the foreign Consulates-General and the Persian authorities. Mr. Elias is of opinion that the Governor-General’s object is to discredit his Government by allowing the affairs of the province to fall into the greatest possible disorder until he is removed or until the Government accepts his terms. An epidemic disease is said to be prevalent in Merv, and Russians and Turkomans, especially the latter, are dying of it in large numbers. Astrabad .—There appears to be great disorder in Shahrud and Astrabad, where the Turkomans have began raiding, and lives and property are unsafe. Karun .—It is common talk in Shuster that the English Government wis h Mr. Tanfield’s assailant to be taken to Ahwaz as they are unable to have him executed in Shuster. The Shusteris declare that they would not permit such an execution. Mohammerah .—The Acting British Vice-Consul, writing on the 13th August, says that he hears that everything is quiet at Ahwaz and also in Shuster, and in the province generally. The Shah seems to have telegraphed to the Muez-es-Sultaneh to compliment him on his good government and on the quiet prevailing in his district. (Signed) HORACE RUM BOLD. Gulhek, September 26, 1896.

THE Persian Minister called at tins office, and submitted proposals to me which, as far as I was able to judge, were identical with those upon which you and the Sadr Azam have already come to an agreement. I informed the Persian Minister that the matter must be arranged in Persia, and that I could not therefore negotiate here with him ; but the general spirit of his proposals appeared to me to be acceptable, although I could not undertake to pledge myself on matters of detail. I added, however, that some questions of compensation still remained to be settled. The Persian Minister then requested that you might be instructed to agree with the Sadr Azam. I replied that I was unable to send instructions, but that I felt sure that, in negotiating with the Sadr Azam, you would display a just and conciliatory spirit. The Persian Minister complained greatly of the manner in which the natives were treated by Messrs. Lynch and their employes.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith a Summary of Frontier News which has been prepared by Mr. Wyndham. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) II. M. DURAND. Inclosure in No. 2. Summary of Frontier News. THE two points which at present chiefly occupy the attention of the Legation are the Karun district and Meshed. But, as the questions at issue on the Karun have been fully dealt with in telegrams and despatches, it will be only necessary in this summary to touch upon the situation at Meshed. From Mr. Elias’ accounts, the weak and desultory nature of government in Khorassan is producing its natural results, and a crisis, of which advantage may he taken by the Russians, is likely to occur unless strong measures be taken to secure order. But, unfortunately, the Persian Govern ment are in no position and seem to have no inclination to take strong measures. The province has long been in a bankrupt condition, and the present Governor, the Asif-ed-Dowleh, is not only in debt to the Government for the taxes due from himself, but has also inherited heavy liabilities from his predecessor. He has applied, through Mr. Elias and this Legation, either to be confirmed in his office or to be replaced. Of the. two he would prefer to be replaced, and to leave his debts and his province. But this the Government declare themselves unable to allow, and say they can find no strong Governor to replace him. Indeed, the absolute lack of any officials possessed of the slightest administrative training is very remarkable. The Sadr-i-Azam stood almost entirely alone during the crisis succeeding the Shah’s death. In Ears, where a strong and just Governor is at present urgently required, the Government [1626 c—1]2 have only been able to send the Nazim-ed-Dowleh, an old gentleman of pleasant manners and some civilization, but apparently lacking in both energy and prestige. In the meanwhile, the Governor-General of Khorassan is said to have practically abdicated. The priests and the fanatical students have been getting out of hand since the death of the Chief Mujtahed, which occurred a few months ago, and, under the turbulent leadership of one Zain-ul-Abedin, they are interfering in the affairs of the Agency, and bringing its business as much as possible to a standstill. The Karguzar, or Foreign Agent, has apparently tried to keep matters straight and conduct his work decently, but his efforts are now rendered useless by the inactivity of the Governor- General, and his conduct has only incurred the enmity of the Russian Consulate- General, who are reported to be intriguing against him, as they have intrigued against other foreign Agents who have not fallen in exactly with their views. The Governor has now been confirmed in his office, and it is to be hoped that this action may bring about some improvement in the condition of Khorassan. (Signed) PERCY C. WYNDHAM.

A claim for such compensation on account of an attack made on a man in his own house by his servant is, as far as I am aware, without precedent.

Gulhek, September 25, 1896. 1 HAVE the honour to reply to your Lordship’s telegram No. 41 of the 22nd September. The Sadr Azam’s threat of resignation need not, in my opinion, be taken as seriously meant. His Highness constantly threatened to resign during the reign of the late Shah, but he never did. If, however, Mr. Tanfield’s assailant is adequately punished by the Persian Government, we can dispense with his execution in view of the fact that Mr. Tanfield is likely to live. The Persian Government have unfortunately only suggested mutilating Saduck. There is no such thing as penal servitude in Persia, and there are no means of carrying out the sentence suggested by the Sadr Azam. When I asked His Highness three weeks ago how lie could guarantee that the culprit remained in prison and was punished, he said that he would devise a plan and inform me of it. But he has not done so as yet. With reference to the other arguments used by the Persian Minister to your Lordship, such a thing as a regular criminal trial in Persia does not exist. Saduck does not deny his guilt, but I was nevertheless careful to make his punishment depend on his being convicted. There need be no fear of a rising at Ahwaz nor of a violent anti- foreign feeling being aroused in the country unless the Persian Government deliberately foments both. No notice has been attracted by the case in Tehran or anywhere else except on the Karun. The demand for compensation is a fair one because Saduck’s crime was probably in great measure the result of the inactivity displayed by the local authorities in the Malamir case and of the dangerous feeling aroused thereby. I will deal with the question as your Lordship has directed me to do, but though I was very reluctant to bring matters to a point for the reasons given in my despatch No. 51 of the 14th ultimo, I think it necessary that the case should now be seriously pressed in the interests of our trade and influence. I have received the Sadr Azam’s promise that he will make proposals in a day or two. The matter is still by way of being dealt with privately, and I have delayed sending in the demands officially on the ground that I did not wish to embarrass His Highness.

P. . _ Foreign Office, September 22, 1896. THE Persian Minister called upon me yesterday at Walmer Castle, havino’ inten upted his cure at Horn burg for the purpose, in obedience to pressing instructions from the Sadr Azam. He read to me long telegrams which he had received from the Sadr Azam complaining of the attitude of Her Majesty’s Government in connection with the attack on Mr. lanfield. His Highness pointed out that the assailant had not been tried, and that, until the trial had taken place, the Persian Government could not give any positive assurance as to the punishment that would be inflicted. The execution of the prisoner at the place where the outrage was committed would have the effect of causing a popular rising for the repression of which sanguinary measures would he necessary. It would create a violent feeling of hostility to foreigners, and would also encourage other Powers to put forward excessive demands upon the Persian Government. The Sadr Azam contended that the demand for compensation was altogether unjustified, became the prisoner was Mr. Tanfield’s servant, and was living in that gentleman’s house when he made the attack on him. His Highness maintained that no Government was held to be liable to give compensation for crimes of this nature. Finally, the Sadr Azam declared that, if the execution was insisted on, it would so completely destroy all possibility of the maintenance of good relations between Great Britain and Persia that he would be compelled to retire from office. I am not in a position to judge how much likelihood there is of this threat beim&gt;’ carried into effect, but, if there is any reality in it, it should be borne in mind that it is much more important in the interest of this country that the Sadr Azam thould remain in office than that Mr. Tanfield’s assailant should be executed. I pressed on the Persian Minister your suggestion that the prisoner should be sent to an Indian penal settlement. He promised to communicate it to his Government, but did not speak encouragingly of the prospect of its being accepted. He stated that the Sadr Azam was prepared to engage that the prisoner should be made to undergo a lono- term ol penal servitude in Persia. You had informed me in your telegram No. 68 of the 7 th instant that a sentence of imprisonment in Persia would' be practically no punish ment at all, but you did not give your reasons for this statement, and 1 was therefore unable to make use of the argument with much effect, and was obliged to confine myself to pointing out that the continuance of the man’s imprisonment would depend on the life of the Sadr Azam and on his remaining in office. It will be desirable that in dealing with this question you should be guided not so much by general principles as by the consideration of the relative advantage to English policy and interests of the several courses which are open to you.

WITH reference to your Lordship’s telegram No. 40, I have the honour to report that I informed the Sadr-i-Azam privately that I should he obliged to send in the official demands of Her Majesty’s Government unless he conld settle the Tanfield case on the lines proposed. His Highness has sent instructions to the Persian Minister in London to appeal to your Lordship against these demands, and especially against the execution of Mr. Tanfield’s assailant, should the former survive. In addition to the necessity of making an example, a strong reason for executing Sadik is that it does not seem possible to punish him effectively in any other way. Her Majesty’s Govern ment could not consent to allow Sadik to be mutilated, and it would be a mere farce to sentence him to be imprisoned. The Sadr-i-Azam admits that Sadik should have been executed in the first instance; but says that he dare not order his execution now, as he fears trouble on the Karun. A dislike of becoming personally unpopular is, I believe, his real reason for this. I informed his Highness that we might possibly waive our demand for Sadik’s execution if he would hand him over to us to be confined in an Indian penal settlement; but that we could not possibly consent to allow him practically to remain unpunished. The Persian Government protest against the humiliation to which they will be subjected if the Governor of Arabistan pays com pensation for the assault on Mr. Tanfield to a British officer at Shuster. I think this is very important. Captain Sykes has been ordered to leave the Karun on account of illness, and I must send some one else to take his place. I should be glad if your Lordship could impress on the Persian Minister how extremely grave the case is.■^3 7 [This Document is the Property of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government,] NO. 7 . PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY. ASIA. CONFIDENTIAL, [September 7.] Section 2. 2499 No. 1 . Sir M. Durand to the Marquess of Salisbury .— {Received September 7.) (No. 51. Confidential.) My Lord, Gulhek, August 14, 1896. I HAVE the honour to submit the following report upon the present condition of affairs in Persia. In the north of Persia the state of affairs since the new Shah’s arrival in Tehran has from our point of view continued to be fairly satisfactory. There has been, and is, some anxiety about the behaviour of the Kurds on the north-west frontier, but hitherto no anti-Christian outbreaks have occurred among the Persian Kurds, and I hope that the prevailing excitement may pass away without trouble. Elsewhere in the north all has been quiet, and the Shah, though somewhat weak and timid, has done passably well. He has paid up the whole of his unsecured debt to the Imperial Bank, and has made some arrangements for the coinage of silver, and for the gradual calling in of the excessive copper currency which has caused so much distress. He does not appear to be under Russian influence to the extent that was predicted by some who knew him. He has, for example, resisted all attempts to dislodge his English doctor, who has now been formally installed as chief physician to the Shah on a salary of 7,000 tomans a-year (1,400/.). He has most resolutely insisted upon appointing as Valiahd, his eldest son, now at Tabriz, instead of the second son, w r ho had the support of the Russians, and was generally expected to succeed. This incident has done some thing to strengthen British influence in the country, for it is generally believed that we pressed the claims of the eldest son. The belief is shared by the new Yaliahd himself, and we are on very friendly terms with him and his mother. This lady, though she insisted some years ago upon being divorced from the Shah, and has since marries] again, still retains much influence over His Majesty, and carries considerable weight in Tehran, Finally the Shah has nominated to a minor Governorship, the Ain-ed-Dowleh, who was leader of the Russian party in Tabriz, and had come here with the full intention of supplanting the Sadr-i-Azam. His great rival, the Farman-Earrna, our most open and fearless adherent in Persia, has been appointed Governor of Tehran, with the command of six regiments. It is somewhat characteristic, both of the Shah and the Farman- Farma, that the latter was forbidden to come to Tehran, lest there should be trouble between him and the Ain-ed-Dowleh, and that he replied by throwing up the Kerman Governorship, and starting at once for the capital, where, so far, he has carried all before him. This state of affairs is promising from our point of view, but unfortunately the state of affairs in the south of Persia is very much less satisfactory. In the province of Ears, which has been scandalously misruled by the late Shah’s brother, the Rukn- ud-Dowleh, there has been considerable disorder. Large quantities of British goods have been plundered, and several Englishmen have been more or less seriously maltreated. One, an Assistant Surgeon in the Telegraph Department, was deliberately waylaid and wounded by a musket shot. Another, a Telegraph Inspector, was stripped of all his clothing and severely beaten. In neither case has anything been done to punish the offenders, though they are known. The Bukn-ud-Dowdeh has now been removed, after many complaints from this Legation and from the people of Shiraz, but a great deal of harm has been done. On the Karun the state of affairs is even worse. I have at last induced the Persian Government to insist upon the payment of com pensation for the Malamir affray, which occurred several months ago, but the soldiers who assaulted our people have been allowed to abscond practically without any punish ment, and the Persian Government now inform me plainly that they dare not do any thing at Shuster, where the mob is a very bad one, and where they have no troops whom they can trust. In consequence, I fear, of the inactivity of the local authorities in this [1512 c—2]2 ease, there has been another attack upon an Englishman, Mr. Tanfield, of Lynch and Co., who has been dreadfully wounded and disfigured. I have the honour to inclose copies of certain papers bearing on this case :— Copy of a Report from Messrs. Lynch.* Copy of Mr. Tan field’s statement. Copy of Dr. Scott’s certificate.* I have tried in vain to get the would-be murderer punished. He has been carried off—nominally in chains for punishment in Tehran—and nothing whatever has been done in Shuster, where the mob hooted and stoned Mr. Tanfield as he was carried down wounded to the river. Not only have the local authorities taken no notice of this brutal demonstration, but when Captain Sykes arrived to inquire into the matter the Governor treated him with marked discourtesy, and refused to return his call. Mr. Sykes is of opinion that an Englishman’s life is no longer safe in Shuster, and Messrs. Lynch and Co. have decided not to send an assistant to replace Mr. Tanfield. I am very reluctant to make any proposals which might be inconvenient to your Lordship, and, when everything is going so well for us in Tehran, I am very reluctant to advocate measures which will be unpalatable to the Persian Government. But our merchants and officials have evidently some reason to urge that the state of affairs described above is such as w r e ought not to tolerate, and that it is incumbent upon us to insist both upon some reparation for the way we have been treated and upon the introduction of such arrangements as will guarantee the safety of our people for the future. Shuster is the natural centre for our trade, and it is just there that fanaticism and hostility to Englishmen have been most conspicuously shown. On the Bushire road order and security will, I think, be restored before long, but I see no chance of this on the Karun under present conditions. I am therefore telegraphing to your Lordship suggesting that Her Majesty’s Government should authorize me to demand the payment of a large indemnity to Mr. Tanfield, the execution of his assailant in Tehran or elsewhere, and an ample apology to be made by the Governor in person to Captain Sykes, at Shuster, for all the misconduct of the Shuster people and the local authorities. I think that these demands, if made, should be pressed upon the Persian Government in such a manner as to insure their being accepted. I have not suggested sending the “ Lawrence ” and f ‘ Sphinx ” to Muhammera, as advocated by Colonel Wilson, Her Majesty’s Consul-General in Ears, because the heat in the Upper Gulf is at this season too great to be faced without urgent necessity, and also because I hope that the Persian Government will not force us to enter upon a naval demonstration for the enforcement of our terms, but such a demonstration may become necessary hereafter. If the Persian Government accept our demands and carry them out the present incident may be regarded as closed, but there will remain the question of our future position on the Karun. At present our merchants naturally consider that an Englishman’s life is not safe at Shuster, and Captain Sykes reports that the Persian Government is really powerless to execute at that place the murderer of an Englishman. The only way, so far as I can see, to establish security for the future, and let our trade develop from this natural centre, is to appoint a resident Vice-Consul under the protection of a trustworthy armed force. That force might take the form of an escort of Indian troops, but it would, in my opinion, be much better on all accounts to raise at the expense of the Persian Government a body of Bakhtiaris and Arabs under British officers. It will be remembered that the Russians have an armed force under Russian officers in Tehran itself. They could not logically object to our having a similar force in the south, and the Persian Government if resolutely pressed would, I believe, agree. They fully understand how hopeless they are against coercion from the side of Muhammera where the powerful Sheikh Mizal, who controls the Karun up to Ahwaz, only awaits a signal from us to throw off his allegiance to the Shah. They are also, 1 think, beginning to understand that if they declare their inability to protect Englishmen from murderous attacks they must expect unpleasant consequences. Moreover, the consequences would not be wholly unpleasant to them. The Persian Government would not like paying for the corps, and they would not like the trouble of overcoming possible Russian opposition; but, on the other hand, they could make some reduction in their existing force, and they know that a body of trustworthy troops under British officers would give the Central Government a firm hold on the province where it * Already received.was quartered. Nothing is more surprising than the small number of armed men required to dominate a Persian town or district. A force equivalent to a single regiment would, I believe, amply suffice for Shuster and the neighbourhood—say 400 or 500 infantry, two squadrons of cavalry, and a couple of guns. Such a force would further be a nucleus for the extension of our influence among the Bakhtiaris and Arabs. Our officers w r ould soon get some knowledge of the surrounding tribes from which their recruits would be drawn, and if we ever desired to extend the system the foundation would have been laid. A similar corps could at any time be raised in Ispahan, where the Zil-es-Sultan would, I feel sure, be delighted to see it. I fully realize the objections to this proposal, and I have not put it forward without long and serious consideration. It means pressure brought to bear upon the Persian Government at a time w'hen in many ways we are getting on very well with them; it also means some trouble hereafter in securing regular payments; it probably means some expense to ourselves: and it may mean that w r e shall alarm Russia and provoke her to some vigorous countermove. She is at present believed to be seriously con templating the establishment of Consulates in Ispahan and Shiraz and Bushire, and any such step as I have proposed might accelerate her movements. Nevertheless, from the point of view of this Legation, I think that we should gain more by it than we could lose. It would be by no means an unmixed evil if we were to show the Persian Govern ment that there are some limits to our forbearance, which they are inclined to doubt. The expense to ourselves would at the worst be inconsiderable. And though I think our proper course with regard to the Russians in Persia is to avoid all sensational and provocative measures, I believe this measure could be carried out without grave con sequences, more especially as there is some talk of augmenting the numbers of the Cossack Brigade in Tehran. I would not, however, advocate that we should insist at all hazards upon raising such a force as I have suggested. I should like to see it raised, for I believe nothing else would so effectually strengthen our influence in the south of Persia; but if the Persians agreed in preference to the establishment of a considerable Indian escort in Shuster, or if they made prompt and effective arrangements on their orra account for the dispatch to Shuster of thoroughly trustworthy troops from elsewhere, then we might suspend the proposal. In fact, while trying to secure our object, I think we might avoid presenting a formal demand. What we really want in the first place is to secure the safety of our traders and their property, and possibly we may find that this can be secured without raising a force under British officers. If so, perhaps we need not press for anything more. I should he glad to be favoured with an expression of your Lordship’s views upon this proposal. I can imagine that it may at first sight seem a somewhat dangerous one, but the present state of Shuster is exceedingly had, and if our trade is to be developed something must he done to maintain order and security there for the future. As to the troubles on the Shiraz road, I presume I am right in insisting upon the right of our traders to receive from the Persian Government either the goods which have been stolen, with compensation for any damage done, or the full value of those goods. The Persian Government practically admit that they are bound by this principle. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. DURAND. Inclosure in No. 1 . Statement of Mr. Taiifield. AT the time I came down to Bussorah, last August, with the small-pox, while on the “ Malamir,” off Muhammera, I put my watch and chain under my pillow. It was stolen during the night. I suspected Saduk, my butler, and when I got back to Shuster I discharged him. About two months later I took him back into my service, not being’ able to get another servant at Shuster. When Mr. Richards left for London I went to Ahwaz and took over charge. After making up my cash account at the end of the month following that in which I took over charge, I found it over 1,018 krans short. I asked Saduk whether any one had been about the office while the money was out of the safe. He replied, nobody except himself. About the same time I also missed 12 rupees and 2 krans of my private money. I taxed him with having stolen the missing money.o 1 . and he declared that he had not seen it, Just afterwards the Shah’s death occurred, and a few days later I proceeded to Shuster, intending to go on to Dizful. When at Shuster Saduk came to me and said that his brother had arrived from Ispahan and wished to enter my service as syce. As I had just discharged my two syces I engaged him, and sent him to Ahwaz, where my horses were. Saduk asked me for 80 krans on account of his own and of his brother’s salary—an advance—as he said that neither of them had any money. We (Saduk and I) left for Dizful. Saduk, who accompanied my caravan, reported on reaching Dizful that he had been stopped on the road and had been forced to pay 50 krans. Domio, my cook, denies the truth of this statement, but says that Saduk told him he had 50 krans stolen from him. When at Dizful, one evening I found my only remaining two-and-a-half bottles of whisky missing. I dined with Agha Ali the same evening, and on my return to my house I found Saduk all of a heap on a shalif of wool. I tried to awaken him, but was unsuccessful. I found that my bed was not ready upstairs, and I eventually made my bed with the assistance of my clerk. The next morning Saduk came to me and said, “ Your watch, together with 50 krans of mine, were stolen last night.” I replied that I did not believe it, and added, “ I believe you have either stolen them yourself, or lost them when drunk,” JS'o more was said about it until rve arrived at Shuster, when, on the 17th, he asked me to make up his account, and whatever he owed me for the watch lie was willing to pay me. I would mention that previous to this, and after my return from Dizful, I had a quiet talk with my clerk. The clerk told me that he was keeping Saduk’s accounts, and that he (the clerk) had 600 krans belonging to Saduk, and also 300 krans in bonds. Saduk had paid him (the clerk) 600 krans immediately after his arrival from Ahwaz. We made up his (Saduk’s) account, and it was found that he owed me 110 krans taking his and his brother’s salary to the end of June and charging him with 85 krans for the cost of the watch (the 1,000 krans which he was suspected of stealing at Ahwaz were not included in this account). This 110 krans balance due to me he drew' from the clerk Yusuf, and paid me, remarking to the clerk at the time that he would make Mulla Mahomed, Lynch’s agent at Dizful, swear that he or his people knew nothing about the robbery, and if he could not get the money out of Mulla Mahomed he knew' how to get it. When I heard this I decided to discharge him the next day. About 9 o’clock that night, although there were twm koojahs full of water on the roof, he came up and put another one there and went down again, I noticed this and thought nothing of it. BeLveen me and Yusuf, the clerk—we both were sleeping on the roof—there is an empty bed. I went to bed about 9. About 10 I found myself out of the bed on the ground and stunned. I saw Saduk lifting up a sword to strike me on the head, and I immediately put up my left hand to save my head. The blow descended and severed the left hand, inflicting a wound on my head. He then made repeated cuts elsewhere and I became unconscious. I knew nothing more until I came to my senses in Yusufs arms. While I was being- carried from the house to the river bank at Shuster a large crowd of people follow'ed us rejoicing that I had been killed, stone-throwing also began, and a stone passed close to the bed on which I was being carried. When I was put on the raft they lined the Shuster bank of the river and continued shouting abuse and throwing stones. Four ferrashes were sent by the Nizam to carry me to the river, but their presence did not appear to have any effect on the crowd. Declared before me: (Signed) J. F.

DURING the past month the country has remained quiet, and the situation on the whole appears to he more favourable, with the exception of the Karun district, where the authorities seem unable to check disorder and to restrain the Arab tribes. Pars .—Towards the end of July matters in Ears came to a crisis. The landowners, merchants, and Ulema had grown thoroughly weary and discontented at the incompetence and misgovernment of the Prince Governor,, the Rukn-ed-Dowleh, brother to the late Shah. Petitions to the Central Government had been disregarded, and the Shah had even sent the Governor a robe of honour. Finally, the leading Notables of Shiraz petitioned the British Minister through Colonel Wilson, who is spending the summer at Shiraz. They threatened, unless their request were granted, to form a camp outside Colonel Wilson’s garden, and, should matters be pushed to extremes, to leave the country. The Petition, which was duly forwarded to the Sadr-i-Azam, was granted. The Rukn-ed-Dowleh Avas recalled, and the Nazim-ed-Dowleh appointed in his place. The new Governor has held important posts. He was Ambassador at Constantinople, and Minister at St. Petersburgh. He has pleasant manners, and speaks French fluently. Tehran .-—The Farman-Farma, late Governor of Kerman, has arrived in Tehran, and has been appointed Governor of the town, and given the command of six regiments. He is English in his sympathies, has a strong aauII and energy, and is likely greatly to strengthen the hands of the Sadr-i-Azam. The Ain-ed-Dowleh, ayIio avus all poAverful at the kalihad’s Court at Tabriz, and was credited with being a friend of Russia, and looked upon as a dangerous rival to the Farman-Farma, and possibly to the Sadr-i-Azam, has been given the governorship of Mazanderan, Avhich Avill remove him from the capital. Kerman .—Disorders are reported on the Beluch frontier, which may become serious if the uoav Governor of Kerman, the Naib-us-Sultaneh, delays much longer in proceeding to his province. Kurdish Frontier .—No fresh massacres have occurred on the Kurdish frontier, and it may be hoped that the arrival of the new Governor, the Amin-ed-Dowleh, aaRI prevent another outbreak. Meshed .—The eastern frontier is quiet, though at Meshed a band of students under cue Zain-ul-Abedin have been attempting to foment disturbances against Europeans, and the Governor is too weak or indolent to put them down. Astrabad .—The Asfrabad agent reports that the price of bread is high, and that there is discontent in consequence. He adds that though the Governor has mutilated a baker the price remains unaffected. (Signed) PERCY C. WYNDHAM.3 ^3( Transport Animals available for Hire.

The figures given under the head “ Annual Revenue ” have been obtained from the official revenue papers for the year 1889-90, since when there has been no change in the revenue. , r, &gt;&gt; 3 The figures given under the head “ Annual Out-turn ” are based on figures given under the head Annual Revenue, wmcn (Annual Revenue) represents one-eighth of the total out-turn in all districts, with the exception of a few, when the proportion is different The number ofploughs generally forms the basis of the assessment of revenue in Khorassan. The out-turn of one plough, though varying at different places, is, on the average, 20 kharwars per annum, and the average rate of revenue levied by Government annually on each plough is 41 tomans in cash, 21 kharwars of chopped straw, and 2) kharwars of grain m kind. The total out-turn is therefore eight times the revenue grain in all districts in Khorassan, except Deregez, Kam, Khusf, and Tabas ; where the whole revenue is levied in cash • Sarakhs, where the revenue is remitted; and Jowain, Bam, and Safiabad, where the rate is different, the greater part ot the revenue there also being received in cash. In Seistan the whole of the land revenue is levied in kind, and represents one-third ot the t ° tal T °^ t ^™ e “ f g ? r g“ under the heads u R equ i r ed for Consumption of People ” and “ Excess for Export” are approximate, native sources of information having mainly to be relied upon. The excess is probably under, not over, the true figures. 5 Th° quantity of grain exported to Russian territory (Trans-Caspia) is estimated at 40,000 kharwars, or 317,0/0 Indian maunds, il, 4,000 kharwars from Bujnurd, 30,000 from Kuchan, 5,000 from Deregez, and 1,000 from Sarakhs. , 6. The best season for procuring supplies is the end of summer. In January less than half the quantity is procurable. Kuc a and Shirwan are the main depots for exports to Trans-Caspia, the business being systematically conducted by Armenians employed by capitalists in Russia. The agents advance money to the peasants, collect their gram after the harvest, store it at the depots, and export when the Trans-Caspian market is favourable. The GrainTraffic of iiAorassnn.—The long-distance carriage of gram m Khorassan depends mainly— (a.) On the demands made by Trans-Caspia; (S.) The requirements of Meshed; (c.)

Supplies necessarUy radiate therefrom to the surrounding less favoured districts, producing thereby several great currents of graia traffic, one north to Trans-Caspia, another east to Meshed, a third south to the pilgrim route, a fourth south-west to Shahrud, with its two branches to Semnan and Yezd. _ ... • t ,i,„ „ Trans-Caspia takes the largest share of the surplus, and its steady demand for cereals has given an enormous impetus to the gram production of Khorassan. At present the surplus of Kuchan, Bujnurd, Isferain, Chinaran, Radkan, &amp;c., is competed for by Trans- Caspia and those districts in or adjoining Khorassan, where the out-turn of grain is insufficient for local requirements, but there is little doubt Russia could obtain a much larger proportion of the surplus if she were prepared to pay the price. The introduction of cotton has not yet materially affected the cultivation of gram. In Kuchan and Bujnurd the climate has been found unsuitable, and in those districts where its cultivation is regarded more favourably, in Deregez and Nishabur for instance, th development has not progressed at the expense of the grain crop. It would seem, indeed, that a greater area of land has been placed under the plough, not that cotton has ousted the wheat and barley. September 4i, 1896. (Signed) H. P.

I HAVE the honour to report the payment, with reference to your Lordship’s telegram No. 39 of the 6 th August, of the compensation demanded in the Malamir case. The criminals in both cases have, however, been practically left unpunished. On the day following Captain Sykes’ arrival at Shuster the Governor of Arabistan left that place, and Captain Sykes reports that the Governor’s brother, who succeeded him in the Government, showed him great discourtesy, and refused to return his call. After a nominal imprisonment, the offenders in the Malamir case absconded, and Mr. Tanfield’s assailant Sadik was ostensibly sent away to Tehran. On leaving Shuster Mr. Tanfield was hooted and stoned by the mob. An. Englishman can no longer live in safety at Shuster. The Sadr-i-Azam declares his inability to control the mob, owing to there being no trustworthy troops in Arabistan. This statement is indorsed by Captain Sykes, who says that it would be dangerous to execute Sadik at Shuster, but that he might be safely executed at Ahwaz. Colonel Wilson urges the dispatch of gun-boats to lie off Muhammera, in order to re-establish British influence on the Karun, and he points out that the Persian Government is very sensitive to pressure at this point, as the Arab Governor of Muhammera, who controls the Lower Karim, would throw off his allegiance with a little encouragement. It would not, in my opinion, be advisable to send gun-boats at present. We are on very friendly terms just now with the Persian Government, though that Government is weak and dilatory, and the situation in Tehran is exceptionally favourable to English interests. Our merchants, however, have serious grounds for complaint, and I would ask your Lordship’s authorization for the following demands:— 1 . That the Governor of Arabistan should pay a visit to Captain Sykes at Shuster, and apologize fully for the misconduct of the local authorities in the Malamir and Tanfield cases. 2. That Sadik, who assaulted Mr, Tanfield, should be executed at Shuster or Ahwaz. 3. That the Persian Government should pay 4,000^. compensation to Mr. Tanfield for the loss of his left arm and terrible wounds. We might also hold the Persian Government responsible for the loss which our merchants have suffered owing to the stoppage of trade at Shuster. I am addressing your Lordship on the advisability of establishing a Vice- Consulate at Shuster, properly protected, in order to give security in future to our traders there.

DURAND. Inclosure in No. 1 . Summary of Fontier News, June 10 to July 10, 1896. WITH the exception of Pars, Arabistan, and the Kurdish frontier, the country is remaining very fairly quiet. But should disturbances arise the central Government would probably have difficulty in coping with them. Through the peculation and mismanage ment of the Naib-es-Sultaneh, continued through a number of years, the army has become untrustworthy, the troops have been, for the most part, long unpaid, and have, in the provinces, shown signs of mutiny. Kasvin. There has been a disturbance at Kasvin, directed against the Governor, who was generally considered both able and popular. The mob paraded a supposed corpse, a man who had been beaten by the Governor’s servants, and carried him through the streets to the Governor’s house. The Governor happened to be calling on the Belgian Minister who was passing through Kasvin, and remained with him till the disturbance had subsided and the supposed corpse had come to life again. Astrabad .—In Astrabad the troops are reported to have revolted, and the Governor was obliged to borrow 3,000 tomans in order to pay them. Tehran —An infantry regiment broke into mutiny a few days ago on the parade- ground in Tehran itself. The men drove away their officers at the point of the bayonet and took “ bast in the main square opposite the bank. There they remained until they received their arrears of pay, nearly 2 , 000 /. Shiraz.' - In Shiraz a large number of merchants and landowners have taken “bast ” in the principal mosque and declare they will not leave it until they have an assurance that their looted property will be restored and that they will be released from taxes. 1 hese disturbances are doubtless chiefly due to the shock which Government has met in the death of the Shah, out evils dating from an earlier date have much to do with them. The depreciated copper currency has caused misery and deep-rooted discontent among the poorer classes. A determined attempt is now being made to remedy this evil. The Imperial Bank, at all its branches, is buying up copper on behalf of the Persian Government, and a contract has been concluded by which it shall import at least 100,000 lbs. of silver to restore the currency. Ur mi. The disorders in Turkey are spreading to the Persian frontier, and reports from Tabriz announce that a holy war is being preached among the Kurds. They have murdered the Nestorian Bishop of Urmi on his way back from visiting the Nestorian Archbishop at Nochea, across the Turkish frontier. [1512 «—1J2 Salmas .—Many Armenians are taking refuge in Persia, and an incursion of the Kurds into the plain of Salmas, where are the British, American, and French Missions, is feared. The Amin-ud-Dowleh, former President of the Council, has been appointed Acting Governor of Tabriz. The Kaib-es-Sultaneh has been given the Province of Kerman, and it is said the Ferman Ferma, the present Governor, is coming to Tehran, where he hopes to receive the office of Commander-in-chief. Khorassan .—The Khorassan frontier is reported to be quite quiet, and the rumoured raids of the Yamuts are said to be an invention of the Chief of Bujnurd in order to bring the notice of the Government on himself and his familv.

Section 1. 2488 No. 1, Consul Sykes to the Marquess of Salisbury.—(Received July 13.) (No. 2.) My Lord, Panjshur, April 2, 1896. DURING- the course of an extended journey in 1893-94 on deputation from the Indian Foreign Department, I enjoyed exceptional facilities in the way of collecting information about Persian Beluchistau, and, as my present connection with the Perso- Kalat Frontier Commission lias included a second journey across the entire country, I propose to summarize the result of my observations. The decade immediately following the Boundary Commission of 1870-72 was spent in consolidating the newly gained territory. General Goldsmid’s Award having confirmed the Persian Government in its possession of Jalk, Kalagan, and other frontier districts, while Kolmk was quietly added to the Shah’s possessions during the process. In spite of isolated outbreaks, Sarhad was the sole district not under control by 1884, which date marks an epoch in Beluchistan history, as the Agent to the Governor-General, for the first time, at the commencement of that year, marched through British Beluchistan to Panjgur in great state, thus demonstrating that the period of more or less shadowy suzerainty on our part was about to end. In the following year, Captain Jennings, who had been deputed to explore Sarhad, reported that rumours of an invasion were everywhere rife, although no actual expedition had ever been made by the Persian authorities. The late Prince Governor indeed visited Pahra, the capital of Beluchistan, on more than one occasion, but never ventured upon a Sarhad campaign, attempting to quiet the country without having recourse to extreme measures. Finding, however, that matters were steadily drifting from bad to worse, in 1887 he appointed Abul Path Khan, his Cossack cavalry officer, to the post of Governor of Beluchistan, letting him clearly understand that the tribesmen of Sarhad must be crushed at all costs. For a time matters ran smoothly, as the internal feuds of the Sarhaddis were used to excellent purpose. Abul Fath Khan marched through Sa.rhad, and by means of his artillery easily defeated the confederacy of Damanis, who 'were not even united among themselves. Pic then began to display a most savage disposition, not only butchering his prisoners, but also destroying all the irrigation channels and gardens wherever he passed, none of which have ever been repaired, from fear of extortion should villages again be built. Upon Ms return to Pahra, Abul Fath Khan was visited by the Kurds of Sarhad, who offered to exterminate the scattered remnant of the Damani tribe. He, however, in return, seized all their Chiefs, seven in number, and ruthlessly put them to death. Not content with this, ho handed over their wives to the tender mercies of his soldiery, an outrage without parallel in Beluchi warfare. When news of this leaked out, universal horror was felt by the now united Beluchis, who sprang to arms under the leadership of the Dizak Chief, and besieged Abul Fath Khan in Pahra, Meanwhile, the Prince Governor of Kerman hastened to the rescue with a large force, upon the approach of which the Beluchis raised the siege and fled. fJpon the arrival of the relieving force Abul Fath Khan was thrown into chains, and an amnesty was proclaimed. After considerable hesitation the Beluchi Chiefs trusted to an oath sworn on the Koran, only to find themselves loaded with chains, and sent to Kerman, where they languished until 1894. Since 1889, the Zain-el-Abidin, now known as the Assad-i-Dowleh, has been Governor of Persian Beluchistan, which he has kept in very fair order, no Chiefs of any influence being left to oppose him. [1366 m— 1 ]2 This brings Beluehistan history down to 1893, the date of my first tour, when the Persian side was perfectly quiet, although such was by no means the case in portions of British Beluchistan. , , p , The policy of the Government of India, which led to the withdrawal or troops m 1894, was entirely misunderstood by the Persian authorities, and .encouraged the local Governor to hope for extension of his jurisdiction. To effect this he immediately set on foot numerous intrigues, while the Binds of Maud augmented the general con fusion by making numerous raids in every direction. . The tour of Captain Kemball in 1895 did much to restore our prestige, which was certainly lowered by the supposed evacuation of the country, while the recent demarcation of the frontier will, more than anything else, prevent the raiding and counter-raiding that was caused by Persian attempts to seize the Mashkel date groves. ^ Nor does the political effect stop at this point, for only last year by the Shah’s express order Mashkel was declared to be a part of the Persian Bmpiio, and the Governor of Dizak visited it in force. The absolute and final blow to this policy oi aggrandizement that w'as caused by the erection of the boundary pillai between Talk and Ladgasht can hardly be imagined. As Kohuk has been Persian for nearly a quarter of a century, every one expected it to remain so, but the fact that w r e have finally taken Mashkel, in the teeth of the Shah’s orders of last year, lias impressed Beluchistan with an overwhelming sense of our power, which should bear good fruit. Second only to political benefits are the great material advantages that may fairly be expected to spring from such a successful settlement, accomplished so smoothly and so speedily. In the first place, by waiving our claim to the date groves of Gorani, Muksotag, and Kindi, not only have w r e gratified the Barman Parma at a nil cost, but also, as the owners of the aforesaid groves are Damanis, the Shah’s Government has no longer any pretext by which to avoid responsibility for the most turbulent of raiding tribesmen. To make the case still more plain, a special clause has been inscribed in the agreement, to the effect that the date groves have been given to Persia on that understanding. It is scarcely necessary to mention the large increase of material wealth that a feeling of tranquillity invariably produces in savage districts, as the whole of our connection with the East is but a series of illustrations to the point, so I will conclude by making a passing reference to the sentiments entertained towards us throughout the country. With the ruling class w T e are distinctly popular, owing to the justice with wdiich all claims connected with property owned on our side are treated, while the Persian or “ Gajjar ” Government generally, and the Kerman prison in particular, is regarded with intense hatred. The lower classes, who are held as serfs by the ruling caste, are still more in our favour, hoping for some amelioration of their lot through our intervention. Both while alone, and as a member of the Prontier Commission, nothing could have exceeded the friendly demeanour of all classes—a fact which it is 'extremely gratifying to record. I have, &amp;c.

VKy / V 7 // No. L Sir M. Durand to the Marquess of Salisbury.—[Deceived July 13.) (No. 42.) My Lord, Gulhek. June 11, 1896. AS I informed your Lordship in my telegram No. 50, His Majesty the Shah arrived in Tehran on the morning of Sunday, the 7 th June. It had been given out that His Majesty would halt a day at 1 aftahad, 4 or 5 miles from the town, and make a public entry on Monday ; hut on arrival at Yaftabad he drove straight on, entering Tehran by a gate not ordinarily used, which enabled him to reach the Palace unnoticed. Directly it was known in the camp at Yaftabad that His Majesty had gone on a stampede set in, every one trying to follow him as closely as possible, and I am told that the scene was one of the wildest confusion, thousands of people on foot, on horse back, and in carriages forcing their way along the Kasvin road and through the narrow gate of the town. The whole performance was to my mind exceedingly contemptible, and I am surprised that the Sadr-i-Azam should have advocated, as he did, so undignified a course. It is defended on the ground that the Persian Government had certain information of an impending attempt upon the Shah’s life, which was to be made at Yaftabad. This, however, I do not believe; and there is no doubt that the Shah’s furtive entry into his capital has had a bad effect on the people, who express their feelings on the subject very freely. I inclose a letter from Mr. Wood, who accompanied His Majesty from Tabreez, regarding the Shah’s journey towards Tehran. Here also some unfortunate incidents occurred owing to the excessive timidity of the Shah or those about him. On the day following His Majesty’s arrival he received the Corps Diplomatique in public audience. His Majesty on this occasion acquitted himself well. He seemed to be in much better health than when he visited Tehran a year ago. He had a healthy colour in his face, and his carriage was firm and upright. In reply to a congratulatory speech made by the French Minister, His Majesty spoke in a suitable and dignified manner, announcing that he intended to follow^ in the footsteps of his father, to draw closer the bonds of friendship between Persia and the allied Powers, and to improve the condition of his country. He also thanked the Ministers present for their co-operation in the maintenance of order after his father’s murder. Altogether, His Majesty created a not unfavourable impression. It was noticed that he made a perceptible, though barely perceptible, return to the salutations of the Corps Diplomatique, which his hither had never done. He was well dressed, and wore great quantities of diamonds. He is not, however, nearly as fine a man as his father was—his figure more sunken and his face less striking. His Majesty leaves Tehran for one of his country gardens to-morrow,*and will remain there for the summer. The new reign may now be considered to have fairly begun, and everything is quiet, except in the province of Fars, the state of which is decidedly bad. This, however, seems to be due entirely to the weakness and avarice of the Prince Governor, the Rukn-ud-Dowleh, and I have no doubt that order will be restored when he is replaced by a stronger man. Prices are high throughout the country owing to the excessive output of copper, and there are other disturbing influences at work; but on the whole the prospect is by no means unsatisfactory, and in some respects I think there is reason to hope for an improvement upon the condition of affairs existing before the late Shah’s death. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. DURAND, [1366 m—2]2 Inclosure in No. 1 . Consul-General Wood to Sir M. Durand. Sir, Tehran, June 10, 1896. HAVING duly carried out my instructions and in company with Prince Dabija, the Acting Kussian Consul-General, brought His Imperial Majesty Muzaffar-ed-Dinn Shah to Tehran, I have now the honour to submit to your Excellency a short account of the journey, its beginning and end. For some days previous to His Imperial Majesty’s departure, the better classes of the native community, as well as the foreigners in Tabreez, were all in an exceedingly anxious state of mind, owing to the threatening reports which were rife in the bazaars as to the resolve of the populace to prevent His Majesty, by main force if necessary, leaving the town until the price of bread, and the question of the copper currency should have been definitively settled, as well as guarantees obtained for the plentiful introduction of grain. So persistent and outspoken was the talk of the bazaars as to the extremes to which the populace would be prepared to proceed in order to obtain the accomplishment of their wishes, that I was forced to the conclusion that it would be more prudent for me to remain in town until I obtained certain news of the arrival of His Imperial Majesty at a safe distance from Tabreez than to follow as I had at first intended to do in his wake. The most careful dispositions having been taken to preclude the possibility of any untoward incident occurring to mar His Majesty’s first steps on the road to Tehran, he was enabled to leave Tabreez with a certain amount of state. A few hours after His Majesty’s exit I followed and found to my surprise the people in the bazaars through which I had to pass, going about their avocations in their usual manner. Once away from Tabreez, however, every one seemed to feel relieved of some great responsibility, and everything from that time proceeded well, and this, notwithstanding the multitude of people the Shah had gathered together to accompany him on his journey. Most of the Chiefs of the Persian Kurds and their followers had been called away from their districts, whilst numerous contingents of horsemen came from all parts to meet and escort His Majesty. The number of people on the road could have hardly amounted to less than 7,000, whilst that of the baggage animals must have been much greater, yet there was not the confusion in the distribution of camping ground, food, and forage which every one had anticipated would occur. The infantry and cavalry, of which latter arm 1,500 were with us, the crowds of horsemen, the drivers of baggage—animals and vehicles were all directed to their allotted quarters, to which they proceeded in remarkably good order, although not without much noise, at the end of every stage. Casualties amongst the baggage and other animals occurred frequently in the first stages of the journey owing to the difficulties of the tracks in some parts, especially in the mountainous country extending from Tabreez to Jamalabad. But few accidents to human beings, I am glad to say, can be recorded. Weather and other considerations retarded our progress somewhat, but this allowed me and my Russian colleague to look about and observe many things, such as the infinite care taken by the Shah or by the Court officials to guard every approach to His Majesty’s quarters. Sentinels were daily to be seen, wearied by their recent march in heavy rain, patiently wending their way to the hill-tops in the vicinity which in any way commanded the Imperial tents, or, when resting in villages, climbing to the roofs of the houses around the building inhabited by the Shah. It was even patent to us that our camp formed part of the dispositions daily taken to prevent all approach to His Imperial Majesty. Peasants who had come from a distance simply to make their bow to their Euler as he passed on his way, as well as the villagers at places he stayed in were warned off by mounted officials armed with long wands, who charged in among them at intervals, long before the arrival of the Shah even. The bad impression created by such precautions and proceedings was most evident. three field pieces, each drawn by eight horses, and coming from the capital, met our camp at Turkomanchai, and these guns, attended by a small mountain battery, accompanied and returned with us to Tehran.3 Great credit is due to General Wagner for the manner in which he brought those batteries over the terrible ground and rushing torrents they had to traverse, especially with the exhausted and badly cared for horses at his disposal. In the worst parts of the roads, 200 or more men, at Wagner’s bidding, used to replace the quadrupeds. Nearing Zinjaan the roads became better and the difficulties of transport of all kinds were much lessened. At Zinjaan and Kasvin the Shah and his Court were royally received and entertained by the respective Governors of these towns, who also paid us visits of courtesy and congratulation. But once on the road did His Majesty ask to see Prince Dabija and me, although he frequently sent us complimentary messages and showed great kindness on hearing of the accident which had occurred to me; but during the few minutes we passed in the Presence, the conversation turned wholly upon sport—at every stage His Majesty, a few minutes after his arrival, would begin shooting at a mark or at passing birds. We reached Tehran, as your Excellency is aware, on the 7 th instant, but the Shah’s entry was not such as every one had anticipated. In reply to our inquiries, the preceding day, as to the ceremonial to be observed on this occasion, we had been informed that we should be made acquainted with the details in writing, and so, on the morning of the 7th, we left camp prepared to stop at Yaftabad, a garden belonging to the Shah, about 6 miles from Tehran, and on this side of the postal station of Shahabad. On our arrival at this place, w T e were somewhat astonished to hear from General Wagner that His Majesty had ordered him to remain behind and inform us that the Shah was actually about to enter Tehran. We lost no time in following His Majesty, whose carriage we soon caught up, but now followed a scene which it is difficult to describe. On the Shah’s sudden decision becoming known all previous order ceased. Every body, even the mule drivers, seemed to be animated with but one insane desire, and that was to enter Tehran with His Imperial Majesty. The cavalry actually charged along the road with loose reins, and the rush of empty carriages, which had been abandoned by their owners for the greater freedom and safety of the saddle, became appalling. From all sides of the level country hundreds of horsemen could be seen converging at full speed upon us, whenever the clouds of thick black dust which now enveloped us like a pall, lifted for a moment, or was dispelled for a few seconds by the currents of air produced by the rush of densely-packed horsemen. My Russian colleague’s carriage and mine were soon separated by struggling com panies, which the Ain-ed-Dowleh and the Hakim-ul-Mulk, both on horseback and abandoned by their attendants, vainly endeavoured to hold back. Apprehending danger to life and limb, almost gasping for breath, and somewhat annoyed by the trick which had been played upon us, I managed to have my con veyance turned away from the road and stopped. From where I was 1 watched the passage of men and animals in a manner which could only be compared to the flight of a panic-stricken and broken army, whose wounded had been left to the enemy’s mercy. I eventually came back to the road, and avoiding the still advancing multitudes, entered Tehran, with my personal escort, through the custom-house gate. On the 8 th instant I had the honour to accompany your Excellency to the sallamlik, at which His Imperial Majesty alluded to the pleasure it had given him to have had us with him on the journey, and thus came to an end my personal connection with Muzaffar- ed-Dinn Mirza, now the occupant of the Persian Throne.

Summary of Frontier News from April 16 to May 14, 1896. IN spite of the assassination of the Shah, the country has been surprisingly quiet, and there have been no disturbances of a serious nature. Prices have risen considerably in the large centres owing to the insecurity of the roads and the consequent reluctance of the peasants to bring provisions in from the country. But this was to be expected. Looting has taken place on the Shiraz road, and some villages have been destroyed by nomadic Kashgais, but energetic measures were at once taken for the suppression of the marauders. Tabriz., —In Azerbijan, where danger was to be feared owing to possible Kurdish incursions and consequent complications, nothing serious has occurred, and the resolve of the new Shah to march to Tehran with only two regiments instead of denuding the province of nearly its whole garrison, as at first reported, will materially conduce to the peace of the district. Meshed. —From reports from Mr. Ney Elias very considerable interest has been excited in the minds of the Bussian officials at Meshed regarding our Afghan-Beluch and Beluch-Persian Boundary Commissions. Mr. Elias describes an interview with the Russian Consul-General. M. Vlassow called and expressed great anxiety about the insanitary state of Sistan. He had information that yellow fever had appeared there, and was afraid he should have to send his Russian doctor to inquire into the matter on the spot. Mr. Elias reminded him that he had already fished for cholera, typhus, and plague in Sistan without success, and recommended that the investigating doctor should be sent rather to South America or the West Indies if he wished to study yellow fever. M. Vlassow urged that it was really a serious matter, that his Government were in earnest, and he seemed suprised that Mr. Elias had not heard of the epidemic. Mr. Elias replied that the only epidemic of which he had heard was the fever that had broken out among the Russian troops in trans-Caspia, and finally suggested that it was late in the season for travelling in Sistau, and that both the Boundary Commissions were expected to finish their work by the end of April. This, M. Vlassow seemed hardly able to believe, and thought they must last a year at least, if not two years, but on returning to the subject of the yellow fever, he said that he must really try and save his doctor from the dangerous duty of visiting Sistan in the hot season. From reports from Meshed the proposed Russian railway from Merv to the Afghan frontier appears to be still in a very elementary stage. Mohammerah. —It is reported from Mobammerab that crops are looking very promising. Messrs. Hotz and Co. appear to have obtained permission to ship more grain; natives are also shipping.

PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY. No. 1. Section 1. [June 15.] (No. 35. Confidential.) My Lord, Tehran, May 14, 1896. I INFORMED your Lordship by telegram on the 1 st May that the Shah had been assassinated, and my later telegrams will have kept your Lordship acquainted with the general course of affairs since that date. I have now' the honour to supplement my telegrams by a fuller account of recent occurrences, and of the existing situation in Persia. About 2 o’clock on the afternoon of the 1st May I w'as in the Legation garden sketching w'hen a servant came out to say that a messenger from the Sadr-i-Azam wished to see me. I went in and found a man I did not know standing in the hall, apparently somew'hat excited. 1 took him into my drawing room, and, after looking to make sure that the door w'as closed, he told me that an hour before, w'hen the Shah was in the shrine at Shah Abdul Azins, to tbe south of the city, a wandering beggar had drawn a pistol and shot at His Majesty but without serious results. The Sadr-i-Azam, he said, wished me to be informed in advance of what had really happened, so that if 1 heard any exaggerated rumours 1 might not attach importance to them. There w'as no cause whatever for alarm on the Shah’s account. This was all I could get out of the messenger, who probably knew r little himself. Immediately after he had gone, General Houtum Schindler, a British subject in Persian employ, came to the Legation breathless with fast walking, and greatly agitated. He said that the Mukhbar-ed-Dowleh, the Persian Minister of Telegraphs, had told him that the Shah was dead, and he felt sure something very serious had happened. With Genera] Schindler came Nawab Hassan Ali Khan, Acting Oriental Secretary, who had seen him enter the Legation. I did not at the time believe the report of the Shah’s death, but I thought it quite possible that the Sadr-i-Azam might have made light of the matter in the hope of preventing excitement and disorder, and I. felt that it was necessary to find out at once the real facts. Doctor Scully, Acting Surgeon of Her Majesty’s Legation, was in the grounds, and 1 therefore directed him to drive with Nawab Hassan Ali Khan to Shah Abdul Azim, where they were to obtain full information, and render any help which might be needed. The Nawab and Dr. Scully returned an hour afterwards with the news that the Shah was dead, and that his body had been brought back to the Palace. Dr. Scully had examined the wound, and said that death must have been almost instantaneous, a revolver bullet having penetrated between the fifth and sixth ribs, and passed upwards through the heart. I afterwards learnt from the Sadr-i-Azam that the shot was fired by a man who was kneeling on the floor of the shrine among some women. The Sadr-i-Azam wished to clear the shrine when the Shah entered, but His Majesty said, “No, let them be,” and walked forward to a railing where he intended to say his prayers. As he stopped, as man who was at his feet drew a revolver and fired. The Shah staggered a few paces and fell, calling to the Sadr-i-Azam, who was close by. The Sadr-i-Azam had not seen that the Shah was seriously wounded, and was engaged in securing the murderer, whom the crowd seemed likely to kill on the spot. Hearing himself called, he went and leant over the Shah, who was lying on the ground supported by those about him. The Sadr-i-Azam opened the Shah’s coat and then saw the wound, from which blood was pouring. He says the Shah looked at him and made an effort to speak but could not, and with a long sigh fell back dead, the effusion of blood stopping suddenly as he did so. According to his own account, the Sadr-i-Azam dashed his heaa-dress on the ground and began to wail aloud, but recollecting himself immediately, he gathered a number of attendants round the Shah’s body and had it borne to his carriage, which was at the gate of the shrine. Seating himself by the side of the body, which was propped up with cushions, the Sadr-i-Azam fanned the Shah’s face as if he were stiff alive, and sent off a [1360 d —1] B2 number of reassuring messages to the Legations and chief officials. He then drove into Tehran, a distance of about 6 miles, holding the dead Shah in his place. When the Nawab and Dr. Scully returned with the news that all was over, they brought with them a message from the Sadr-i-Azam to myself. His Highness told me that the Shah was dead, and requested me to inform the Valiahd through Her Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz. His Highness further requested that I would “ beg the Valiahd to come here at once.” When I received this message 1 felt that the position was somewhat serious; for compliance with the Sadr-i-Azam’s request practically involved the recognition of the Valiahd as Shah, which might commit Her Majesty’s Government to a course they would have wished to avoid, I therefore thought over the question for some little time before deciding. It soon, however, became clear to me that my proper course was to do what the Sadr-i-Azam wished, and to throw all the weight of this Legation at once upon the Valiahd’s side. Any appearance of hesitation would have done much harm. It would have raised the hopes of others and encouraged them to put forward their claims, thereby endangering the peace of the country, and perhaps making the Vaiiabd our enemy for life. It would also have forced the Sadr-i-Azam to turn to the Russians, who were known to be in favour of the Valiahd. I should, in fact, have been playing straight into their hands. If I had known that Her Majesty’s Government or the Government of India held any strong views as to the claims of any other candidate, the question would have been more difficult; but 1 had reason to believe that this was not the case, and as the Valiahd was, in my opinion, the rightful heir, whom we could hardly oppose with any semblance of justice, I did not think there was much room for doubt. 1 therefore sent a telegram to Mr. Wood, as desired by the Sadr-i-Azam, and instructed him, if possible, to make the Valiahd act energetically and lose no time. I also informed your Lordship by telegram of what I had done. After these telegrams had been dispatched; 1 made such arrangements as were possible for the maintenance of order in the Legation, warning the guards and servants that every one must remain at his post, and that there must be no sign of alarm or excitement. There was, in fact, nothing of the kind. The gates were kept open, and the Legation servants went on with their work as usual. It will be understood that the news of the Shah’s death was not generally known outside, and the Sadr-i-Azam was anxious to gain' time in order to take measures for the preservation of orders. I am glad to say that during a rather trying afternoon, while the bad news was spreading, and an outbreak among the unruly population of the bazaars might have occurred at any moment, the English people scattered throughout Tehran all behaved well. While the Russian bank closed at once “forten days.” the English bank remained open, and the telegraph employes did not leave their offices. Nothing was done to bring discredit on the country. About 4 o’clock an Italian officer in the Persian service, General Maletta, who is an Aide-de-camp to His Royal Highness the Naib-es-Sultaneh, came to see me on His Royal Highness’ behalf. He said the Prince was much distressed and agitated by what had happened, and most anxious for my advice. I had before the Shah’s death arranged to go and see Plis Royal Highness that day, and my carriage was ready, so I drove over at once, taking General Maletta with me. The Prince had left the Palace when he found his father was dead, and had come to his walled garden of Amerieh, a mile or so from the Legation and in a comparatively open part of Tehran. As I passed along- the streets I saw no signs of excitement among the people. The news had evidently not reached them. Your Lordship is aware that the Naib-es-Sultaneh is the third son of the late Shah, and was during his father’s lifetime a person of great importance. He was Commander-in- chief of the Persian army and Governor of Tehran. In common with his elder brother the Zil-es-Sultan, now at Ispahan, he was regarded as an enemy of the Valiahd, and a candidate foi the Thione. On the conduct of these two sons of the Shah depended the chances oi a peaceful succession, for either had it in his power to raise serious trouble. I felt therefore that the interview to which I was going was important, and that it would oe well to spctUv as decidedly as possible in order to keep Plis Royal Highness from com- micting himself to an^ undesiiahle action. I also felt that to avoid misunderstanding X had better let the Sadr-i-Azam know where I was going and what I meant to say, for the Naib-es-Sultaneh had always been hostile to him. Accordingly, before starting 1 instructed Nawab Hassan Ali Khan to inform the Sadr-i-Azam that I had been asked to see the Naib-es-Sultaneh, and to advise him in his difficulties. I said the advice I intended to give was that the Naib-es-Sultaneh should at once telegraph to Tabriz and assure the Valiahd he was the Valiahd s loyal brother and subject. The Nawab went to the Palace with this message and I started for Amerieh. On arriving at Amerieh I found the gates shut and surrounded by soldiers. I was?&gt; admitted by the east entrance, and led up the straight gravel drive towards the front door of the Prince’s house. The house also was swarming with soldiers in red coats. The Prince was seated on the ground in the middle of the drive. As I approached he got up from the ground and shook hands with me, and we were left alone. He looked shaken and disordered, his face pale, and his blue uniform trousers and pointed patent-leather boots covered with dust. I offered my sincere condolences, for though a man of no character, he had been his father’s favourite son, and it was evident that the Shah’s death had been a great shock to him. After a short time, however, I found that grief for the loss of his father was not his strongest feeling. He was thoroughly frightened on his own account, and apprehensive of ill-treatment at the hands of the Yaliahd if the latter came into power. I tried to reassure him, urging him to put himself right with his brother at once, promising to help him, and expressing my conviction that if he would loyally accept the situation, his life and property would be safe; but it was all to no purpose. Once be had fully realized the fact that he had no chance of succeeding to the Throne, regarding which he had evidently entertained some hopes, he broke down completely, declared that he was in fear of his life, and implored me to protect him. It was not, he said, the Valiahd that he feared personally, but those about the Valiahd, and some of the officials here, meaning, I suppose, the Sadr-i-Azam. Finally, he asked whether he could become a British subject. He was talking Persian, but he knows a little French and, to make sure that I understood his exact meaning, the Persian word being rather vague, he said “ Sujet Anglais—peut-on devenir sujet ?Anglais ?” I told him this was not possible for any Persian subject in Persia, and did all I could to put some heart into him, but his answer was, that if he could not become an English subject he must become a R ussian. I told him that on that point he must decide for himself and, again urging him to put himself right with the Valiahd at once, I took my leave. I had spoken throughout on my own account, telling the Prince that I had no instructions to give him advice; but I had added that I felt perfectly certain Her Majesty’s Government would support the Valiahd, whom he himself and all Persia had recognized as Heir Apparent for many years past. During our interview a man shouted outside the gateway by which I had entered. The Prince at once called out to his attendants: “ What is the matter ? Are there plenty of soldiers at the gate ? Let no one come in.” It was evident that his nerves were thoroughly shaken. As I was leaving the Prince’s garden with General Maletta, who told me he had been advising the Prince in the same sense as myself, a Legation gholam came up with a note from Nawab Hassan Ali Khan, saying he had delivered my message to the Sadr-i-Azam, that His Highness entirely approved of my advice to the Prince, and that he would be glad if I would come to him in the Shah’s Palace. I drove down, accordingly, through the main square of Tehran, where the troops were assembling rapidly, and the artillery men falling in about the guns. It was evident that the news was now getting out, but troops and people were quiet enough, and there were no signs of disorder. I was driving myself in an open carriage, and was recognized, but far from being treated with any rudeness, I thought the attitude of the soldiery was more than usually respectful. The various guards saluted carefully, and in the narrow street leading to the Palace way was cleared for me at once. When I arrived at the Palace I was shown into the great Inner Court, where I found assembled the Shah’s brothers and other relatives, with the Sadr-i-Azam and the principal officials. The Russian Charge d’Affaires, M. Stcheglow, had arrived just before me. After Qtpgj’jj^g my condolences to the Shah s family, I joined the Sadr-i-Azam, who was standing close by in conversation with M. Stcheglow, and we sat down by the edge of the fine sheet of water which occupies a large part of the court. We had hardly begun to discuss the situation, w r hen a man came up and informed the Sadr-i-Azam that the Valiahd was in the telegraph station at Tabriz, and wished to speak to him. The Sadr-i-Azam put an end to the conversation at once, and asked us whether we would accompany him to the telegraph office in the Palace. We agreed to do so, and, walking up in a narrow stair, were shown by the Sadr-i-Azam into a small room, where a Persian telegraph clerk was seated at his instrument. With us were our interpreters, Nawab Hassan Ali Khan and M. Grigorovitch. There was no one else in the room. After we had found some seats the Sadr-i-Azam told the telegraph clerk to inform the Valiahd he was present, and in dictating the message he made use, after a moment’s hesitation, of the form of address used to the Shah. He had been showing signs of suppressed agitation before this, and the use of the familiar words seemed. suddenly to overcome his self-control. He got up from his seat and burst into a passion of tears, hiding his face against the wall and sobbing wildly, until at last he completely lost his breath as a small child does. I thought he was going to break down altogether, for his [1366 d—l] B 24 sobbing fit was followed by an attack of pain about the heart, and he looked very ill. However, we induced him to go back to a small couch in the corner of the room where he had been sitting, and after some time his sobs grew quieter, and the pain left him. He then set to work again. From that time, although occasionally overcome for a moment, he dictated orders and telegrams with remarkable promptitude and ability, never losing his head, or seeming to be in doubt as to what he should do. The first telegram sent by the Valiahd after the Sadr-i-Azam had reported himself present, was an inquiry as to what persons were in the Palace. The Sadr-i-Azam replied, giving a list of nobles and officials, and adding that the British Minister and the Russian Charge d’Affaires were also present. The Valiahd then inquired whether the iNaib-es- Sultaneh was there, and the Sadr-i-Azam said, &lt;£ No, that he was attending to the troops,” which was more charitable than true. There was a short pause, and then the Valiahd sent back a well-worded and dignified message, in which he nominated the Sadr-i-Azam permanent “ Prime Minister,” and called upon all the Persian nobles and officials to support him. His Royal Highness took up at once the position of Shah, and his message created a great impression. Suitable answers were sent bv the Sadr-i-Azam and the crowd of nobles and officials who were gathered outside, and finally the Russian Charge d’Affaires and I telegraphed our condolences, to which the Valiahd replied in satisfactory terms. During this time it had got dark, and candles with glass shades had been brought into the room and placed in a row along the floor. It was an interesting, and in some respects, a touching sight. The Sadr-i-Azam reclined on his couch in the corner, dictating or listening to the telegrams, and at times breaking into a sudden lament. 'The old telegraph clerk, who had been much with the Shah, sat clicking at his instrument, with the tears pouring down his face. The Russian Charge d’Affaires, when the Sadr-i-Azam was not consulting us about some point on which he wanted advice, walked restlessly about the room, smoking innumerable cigarettes and conferring in whispers with his interpreter. On the walls, dimly seen by the feeble light of the candles, were pictures of the Shah on horseback, hunting leopards and antelope. There was also a picture of Alexander I of Russia, in uniform. At the door was an attendant with a samowar and a china teapot, and the Sadr-i-Azam’s “ kalian.” Throughout the evening the Sadr-i-Azam, who is a great tea-drinker, was taking long draughts from the spout of the teapot, and smoking. In the intervals of the telegraphing, military officers came with reports and inquiries, for the Commander-in-chief having shut himself up at Amerieh, the arrangements for the protec tion of the town devolved on the Sadr-i-Azam and his supporters. All these arrangements were made without flurry or loss of time, and when I left the Palace, a little before 10 o’clock, the town had been divided into sections, with strong- infantry pickets at important points, and the so-called Cossack cavalry, which is under Russian officers, was patrolling the streets in all directions. The infantry were mostly Turks, and fairly trustworthy. They had all received an instalment of pay, of which they were much in need, for the Naib-es-Sultaneh had left them months in arrears. Ammuni tion had also been served out to them, and many had even received new uniforms. The prompt and efficient manner in wdiich all this was done seemed to me to speak well for those concerned. A good deal of the credit was, I think, due to the Russian Colonel of Cossacks, a soldierly looking man of great size and pleasant manners, who made himself very useful. During the time that I was at the Palace a shot was fired close by, and caused some excitement. Officers were sent out to make inquiries, but the affair proved to be of no importance. A soldier had dropped the butt of his rifle on the ground, and it had gone off by accident. The last point which came up for discussion w T as the position of the Naib-es-Suitaneh. Before sunset it had been ascertained that the bulk of the troops could be trusted to obey the orders of the Sadr-i-Azam, and that two regiments would only remain with the Prince. It was now decided that these regiments, being composed chiefly of Persians proper, might safely be disregarded, and that the Prince should be left to do as he pleased. His timidity was felt to be a safeguard for his inaction ; and the Persians could be trusted to desert him as it became apparent that his day was over. The result has proved that the decision was correct. As I drove back to the Legation I found the streets were well lighted and in good order; the artillerymen were at their guns in the main square, and the important buildings along the route were all guarded by detachments of infantry. One could not drive 50 yards without passing or meeting a Cossack patrol. In the course ot the evening I received a message from the Zil-es-Sullan, the Shah’s eldest son and Governor of Ispahan, asking me for advice, and saying that if the Shah was dead he would rely on our protection. I answered him as I had answered the Naib-5 es-Sultaneh, advising him to telegraph at once and put himself right with the Valiahd. I am happy to say that His Royal Highness accepted this advice without delay, and that he has s JRce acted sensibly and well. There has been no sign of trouble at Ispahan. Ihemght passed quietly, and the next morning all was in thoroughly good order. ' ^ went d° wn to the Palace, later in the day, I found the Sadr-i-Azam cool and confident, much the better, as he told me, for having been able to give free vent to his griei during the night. He said he had cried till sunrise, and that this had relieved him greatly. It was the necessity for restraining his tears and controlling himself that had tried him so much the day before. In spite of all their falseness there is something cuiiously simple and emotional in the character of the Persians generally, and many besides the Sadr*i-Azam were openly and unaffectedly overcome by the Shah’s death. The Sadr-i-Azam went on to inform me that the Russian Charge d’iVffaires had come back in the small hours of the night with the news that he had taken the Naib-es-Sultaneh under Russian protection, getting His Royal Highness to sign in return a paper renouncing all claims to the Throne. This unnecessary and injudicious proceeding has aroused the suspicion and resentment of both Shah and Sadr-i-Azarn, and as M. Stcheglow, though clever, lias in other ways shown himself somewhat officious and meddlesome, the Persian Government has telegraphed to St. Petersburgh in such terms that M. de Biitzow is returning at once. The unhappy Prince, meanwhile, has brought upon himself the contempt of the Sadr-i-Azam and the Russian Legation, by informing them both that whenever he acted against their interests in the past it was by the direct order of his father, whose autograph letters he offers to produce. At noon on the day after the Shah’s assassination the Valiahd, Muzafar-ud-Din, was formally enthroned at Tabriz, and the ceremony was attended by the Consular Repre- sentatives. I had instructed Mr. Wood to be present and to offer my cordial congratula tions, which he did. _ murderer of the late Shah, Myrza Mahomed Reza, cloak-maker, of Kerman, is a disciple of one Jemal-ud-Din, a Persian refugee residing in Constantinople. The murderer regards Jemal-ud-Din as the last and greatest of the Prophets, sent down from Heaven to regenerate the world. He seems to be a hopeless enthusiast, with no regard for his own life, or that of others, where Jemal-ud-Din is concerned. He says he killed the Shah at Shah Abdul Azim because Jemal-ud-Din was torn from sanctuary there to be exiled. The Shah’s body has been placed in a temporary tomb or coffin pending final burial at Shah Abdul Azim, and is lying upon the raised platform which the Shah used to occupy in the “takia” or amphitheatre where sacred plays are acted. The steps below it are draped with rich cloths and carpets, and the coffin is surrounded by a tall frame work festooned with white flowers. On the 8 th May, the last day of mourning throughout Persia, I went down to the Palace to lay upon the temporary grave a wreath which Her Majesty the Queen had expressed a wish to send. I had previously ascertained that this would be in accordance with the wishes of the family, and in no way contrary to Mahomrnedan religious feeling. I was, however, somewhat surprised at the reception whiclr we met on arrival. The Sadr-i-Azam had sent me a message asking me to come with the Legation staff, and I had accordingly taken with me Mr. Wyndharn and Mr. Rumbold of the Diplomatic Service, and Nawab Hassan Ali Khan. When we entered the Palace we were met by a great number of the Shah’s relatives and principal officials, who formed a procession and walked before us to the amphitheatre. 1 carried the Queen’s wreath, and Mr. Wyndham another wreath offered by the Legation. In the amphitheatre the Sadr-i-Azam received us on behalf of the Shah. I told him in a few words that it was our custom to send wreaths of flowers to a grave as a last tribute of respect to the dead, and that the Queen had desired me to send a wreath on her behalf in remembrance of her sincere personal friendship for the late Shah. The Sadr-i-Azam answered that the family were deeply touched by this mark of friendship for their dead King and father, and that it would never be forgotten, We were then led across the amphitheatre to the foot of the steps upon which the body was lying, and there handed the wreaths to the Shah’s relatives, two of whom mounted the steps and laid the wreaths on the head and foot of the tomb. The ceremony was solemn and affecting, and seems to have produced a great impression. I do not know that it is necessary for me to say much regarding the course of affairs since the accession of the new Shah. In Tehran and most of the important centres all lias remained ‘quiet, but there has been some disorder and robbery in Shiraz and the neighbourhood. This, however, is largely due to the fact that the Nomads are just now migrating to their summer quarters, and the roads about Shiraz, over which the Dus hire trade passes, are covered with hungry tribesmen. They could not be expected to forego such an opportunity of carrying off a little plunder. Order is now being restored, and6 o much of the stolen property is being recovered. Not a single European has lost his life throughout, though a few have been robbed and maltreated. The central Government is being carried on by the Sadr-i-Azam, and one cannot but be struck by the capacity he shows now that his hands are free. Tehran is under thorough control, and the attitude of the population towards Europeans is unquestionably much more respectful than it was before. The troops and police have evidently got their orders on this point, and the difference is marked. The perpetual salutes as one passes along the streets are in fact somewhat embarrassing. Not a single affray or robbery has occurred since the Shah died. The Imperial Bank has remained open throughout in spite of a serious run upon it the day after the Shah’s death, and has been of great service to the new 7 Government by freely supplying silver for the payment of troops and other purposes. In so doing it has incurred some risk, but it has enabled the Sadr-i-Azam to avoid opening the late Shah’s treasure, and he hopes to hand this over intact on His Majesty’s arrival, which is to him a subject of much self congratulation. The Sadr-i-Azam has also received from the various provincial authorities effusive protestations of attach ment, and the Shah consults him on every detail. He is, in fact, at this moment much stronger than before—too strong he tells me—for there will be many to play on the Shah’s jealousy of so powerful a Minister. The Shah himself still lingers at Tabriz. This does not matter so much now that the Zil-es-Sultan has given in his adhesion, and the Naib-es-Sultaneh has effaced himself, but it is a pity nevertheless. There is, however, some ground for His Majesty’s hesitation. Though there are now no dangers in his front, his own province is not in good order, and I can understand his reluctance to leave it behind him while bread is dear, and the Kurds are threatening to raid the frontier, and the R-ussians are ready to “help him in case of need,” as they have informed him they are. This is the worst feature of the situation. If order can be kept in Azerbaijan, and no pretext be given to the Russians for pushing troops forward, all will now go well, and the Shah will begin his reign in peace with excellent prospects. It is too early to form any confident opinion as to the course which the Shah will pursue when once he becomes firmly settled on his throne. He is no doubt weak, and he is said to be somewhat superstitious. But I see no reason w 7 hy we should anticipate that he will be a very bad ruler; and it is more than possible that he may prove a fairly good one. If he keeps the Sadr-i-Azam in Office, and abides by the Sadr-i-Azam’s advice, he will probably be stronger than his father was. He mas possibly be under some embarrassing pledges to Russia, and if not, the Russians will no doubt make a strong effort at first to establish an influence over him. But he has shown that he can be obstinate enough at times in his dealings with them, and there is, I think, no doubt that the Sadr-i-Azam will teach him to rely upon us for help and support against Russian encroachments. So far it seems to me the Russians have lost rather than gained ground since the Shah’s death, in spite of the great advantage accruing to them from their having military officers in evidence at Tehran. 1 do not think, therefore, that we need look forward to the future of Persia, and of our influence in Persia, with any feeling of despondency. We may not see the many reforms of which the Sadr-i-Azam is already beginning to talk, but I believe we shall see an improvement in some respects, and at all events we have escaped the general break up which so many people expected to occur whenever the late Shah should come to die. Owing largely, I believe, to the suddeness of his death, which gave no time for preparation, and to the strong felling of horror it called forth, we have succeeded in establishing the precedent of an undisputed succession. That precedent will, I hope, be followed in future, and if the Persians are prudent and careful in their attitude towards Russia, there is no reason why the country should not retain its independence for many years to come.

Inclosure in No. 1 . Summary of Frontier News from May to June. Tehran .—The country on the whole is remaining very quiet, and the entrance of the Shah into Tehran will tend to restore confidence and revive trade, which had been almost at a standstill since the death of the late Shah. Shiraz .—The worst cases of pillaging have occurred on the southern road between Shiraz and Bushire, and the losses of the larger firms, though detailed claims have not yet been received, is put down at over 10,000/., while the destruction to Persian property and the robbery to flocks and herds has been very considerable. The chief offenders are apparently the Kashgais and Arabs; the behaviour of the Bachtiaris has been good, and not a single case of pillaging on their part has been reported. Kanin. — Reports from Arabistan show that the Nizam as Sultaneh is incapable of administering his province or preserving order. A state of anarchy prevails amongst the Arabs on the Karim, though a temporary truce has been concluded amongst them to allow of the harvest, which is said to be particularly good this year, being carried. Ispahan. —The Zil-es-Sultan has preserved perfect order at Ispahan. He was nervous at first as to his own prospects, but has now been reassured by receiving complimentary messages and a sword of honour from the Shah. Meshed. —Meshed and the Province of Khorassan appear to be quite quiet. Mr. Elias received the news of the Shah’s death on 2nd May, and communicated it to the Governor-General, who received at the same time a telegram from Tehran saying that the Shah had been wounded. In fact, throughout r the country much greater confidence has been placed by the local authorities in the news communi cated by the British Agents than in that received from their own Government. Mr. Elias advised the Governor-General to place himself at once and unreservedly under the orders of the Sadr-i-Azam, and these directions appear to have been loyally followed. Tehran, June 10, 1896.

I HAVE the honour to inclose, for your Lordship’s information, the copy of a despatch I have addressed to Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, giving details of the general state of affairs and of the occurrences which have taken place at Tabriz since the accession of Muzzaffar Eddin Mirza to the Throne of Persia. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL G. WOO!). Inclosure in No. 1 . Consul-General Wood to Sir M. Durand. Sir, Tabriz, May 14, 1896. IN continuation of my despatch to your Excellency of the 7th instant, in which I reported the events which had occurred on and after the death of the late Shah, I have the honour to submit the following. Eor one or two days after the accession of Muzzafiar Eddin Mirza to the Throne of Iran the lamentable state of affairs which I have brought to your Excellency’s notice as prevailing in Tabriz, i.e., the disturbed state of the public mind, owing to the late Shah’s intervention in the matter of the copper currency value of the kran and the extraordinary prices to which the commonest necessaries of life had attained, a result due partly to the above intervention as well as to the negligence and apathy of our highest authorities in everything affecting the public welfare, had improved somewhat. Such improvement, however, became intermittent, and things had at last reached a serious phase. The resignation of the Beglerlegyship by the Emir Toman’s brother brought matters almost to a crisis in the Bazaars. The quality of the little bread exposed for sale at once deteriorated, and the public mind became much disturbed. The Emir Toman being induced, however, by the Shah, to accept the post vacated by his brother, matters have again somewhat improved, for wheat has been ordered from B/ussia and the surrounding districts, and is coming in, though slowly. Ere long, it is to be hoped, things will return to their normal state. 1 have urged upon the Beglerbegy the importance of calming the public mind by the publishing of Notices showing the efforts which are being hurriedly made by the authorities to bring, if not plenty, at least a sufficiency of the necessaries of life to Tabriz. I have likewise suggested that some declaration should be promulgated by the Shah, speaking of his affection for the province in which he has passed the best years of his life, and of His Imperial Majesty’s firm intention to depart from Tabriz only after he has seen it thoroughly supplied and contented. Erom what I have heard since, my suggestions have been found good and are likely to be carried out, with the exception of a hint which I had put forward that the Shah should, in person, see to the distribution broadcast of a few thousands of tomans to the populace. This, it seems, would not he a correct proceeding, but the money will be distributed by specially appointed officials, f1366 a—1]2 My friendly offices, in fact my attitude towards the higher authorities since the death of the late Shah, seems to have much aided in convincing them of the kindly feelings entertained for this Empire by Her Majesty’s Government, for I have been made a great deal of, and have been visited by those occupying the highest posts near His Imperial Majesty’s person, who have actually begged my goo;l offices with the Shah. On the other hand, I have failed in making His Imperial Majesty understand the necessity of an early start for Tehran, accompanied by as small a retinue as his dignity would allow; hut circumstances are against him in this matter, as every member of his past Court, together with their followers and parasites, have made up their minds to accompany him to Tehran, in order, as they believe, to ne present at the immediate distribution of honours. To the numbers of these, amounting to hundreds, must he added the numerous militarv escorts which His Imperial Majesty considers it necessary to take with him on the road. When this is taken into consideration much time must be employed in gathering together the necessary means of transport and sufficiency of food supplies for, perhaps, some 8,000 people. There seems, judging from the many persons ol high standing around the bhah who have endeavoured to obtain my opinion and that of my Hussian colleague as to whom we considered the rightful heir to the Heir-Apparentship, that some doubt must have arisen in the matter at the Palace. The Shah is, we are told, in favour of appointing the Ettisaad Essultaneh as Yali, and notwithstanding the fact that according to custom his younger brother Shoah Essultaneh* has the better right to that position, as being of unalloyed Iloyal blood on both sides of his parentage, whilst the mother of the Ettisaad is said to have been of plebeian origin. Both 1 and my Hussian colleague have refrained from expressing an opinion on the subject, and have limited ourselves to replying to our persistent interviewers that we would he bound to accept as Yali Ahd any member of the imperial family who should be favoured by the laws and customs of the country and by the foreign Powers. The Ettisaad Essultaneh has not been, unfortunately for him, much favoured by Ho is uot prepossessing in appearance, and seems to he of less than ordinary I vivacity of comprehension and intelligence. He has been some five years endeavouring to master a few sentences in Trench, ; and has not quite succeeded. Whilst, on the other hand, the Shoah Essultaneh, although much younger, has •, impressed me much more favourably. He can converse currently in Erench, has exceedingly nice manners, and is animated, as every one who has come into contact with him soon discovers, by an ardent desire for information on all and every subject. Where the competition between these young Princes may lead them I cannot say ; but I much fear that the elder, whom I fancy possesses a cold-blooded nature, may ; succeed in clearing the way at any cost. On the other hand, the chances of both these Princes may he extinguished by the appearance of male issue by the favourite consort of the Shah,f the sister of the firman Eirma. I have had a long interview with the Ettisaad Essultaneh on the morning of the 13th instant, His Imperial Highness, contrary to his usage in the past, offered me a seat close to his person. He informed me that he was remaining at Tabriz and in charge of this province, and in my turn I pointed out the officials whom experience had taught me were the most fitted by their intelligence and honesty to afford His Imperial Highness the best support in the important position he was to occupy, and also impressed upon h’s mind the absolute necessity of making every effort to satisfy and calm the public mind, and avoid thereby adding to the difficulties of the situation and the troubles which may yet have to he faced by the Shah. Eor the first time since my arrival here have I seen His Imperial Highness look cheerful and able to converse freely. * This Prince, Colonel Picot told me, is best qualified to succeed the Shah, and his nomination as Heir- Apparent would be most popular among the Persians.—F. H. V. j- A son was born to this Princess since 1 began this despatch.—C. G. W.3 The conversation was carried on with the help of Mr. Vardon, my English clerk, as His Imperial Highness did not feel that his knowledge of Erench was sufficiently up to date. Muzzafar Eddin Shah is a man whose kindness of heart and amiability amount to positive weakness. Brought up as he has been for so many years by an interested crowd of sycophants and servants, he can only see things through their eyes. His attention on the most serious matters cannot he engaged for long, and he will suddenly turn the conversation, with some allusion to the good qualities of a gun or the pleasure of the chase. The advice of the last comer, be he one of the Palace dwarfs, a scribe in temporary favour, or a groom, has the best of the arguments. This weakness has been the stumbling block in my path whenever I have endeavoured to call his attention to his responsibilities as a Prince. His Imperial Majesty’s character may change as he awakens gradually to a knowledge of the power in his hands and the responsibilities now resting upon his shoulders. Such sudden turns are not uncommon among Eastern Princes, but I fear he lias been too long detained in leading strings to think, judge, or act for himself. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL G-.

The Ameer of Afghanistan to the Viceroy of India. (Translation.) (After compliments.) 26/A of Ramzan, 1313 II (March 11, 1896). I HAVE the honour to inform your Excellency that, for purposes of the mercan tile transactions of the people of Afghanistan, which from years past up to the present time were carried on in Persia, where the Afghans used to so for trade, an official of [1237 n — 1 ]this Government, under the designation of “ Yakil-un-Tijarah,” was always stationed at Meshed; and whenever, during their mercantile transactions, any question arose which had to he referred to the Persian authorities in Khorassan, or to other Persian officials, all correspondence and negotiation connected with it used to he canied on through the ahove-mentioned official. Thus, up to last year, Mirza Yusuf, a native of Herat, who was appointed by me for this purpose, carried on the work. But, finding him dishonest, I dismissed him, and deputed to Meshed another person, by name Abdulla Khan’ head of the merchants (Tajerbashi) of Herat, to take charge of the work and to attend to the mercantile affairs of Afghan merchants. After he had reached Meshed and had been some time there, some of the Persian officials, at the instigation of the discharged Mirza Yuzuf, told the Tajerbashi that they could not recognize his appointment to the post at Meshed, without Royal firman from their own Government. On this he reported the circumstance to me, and £ wrote to Sir M. Durand, the British Minister at Tehran, stating that, as Afghans have large •business dealings in Persia, there was always a Commercial Agent of this Government stationed at Meshed, and no one said anything to him; and that as _ the Persian •officials in Khorassan now raise these objections, he (the British Minister) should obtain a Royal firman from the Persian Government and send it to the officials of Khorassan, so that they might desist from such irregular and unusual representations; that if it be decided that no Afghan Commercial Agent should reside as before in Meshed, then it would be necessary for the Afghan merchants also to cease all commercial business in Persia and never more visit that country. I have now received a reply from Sir M. Durand, a copy of which I inclose for your Excellency’s information, and I write that if the high officials of the Persian Government, acting contrary to the former usage, do not permit the Afghan Com mercial Agent to reside in Meshed, then it will be necessary for me also to give decisive orders to the Afghan merchants that they must not in future visit Persia, and must terminate all the business which they have in Persia; as some Afghan merchants used to trade in Askabad, Merv, Panjdeh, and other localities in that direction, all of them must put a stop to all their business in Persia, and carry on their commercial dealings in Askabad, Merv, and other places there. Therefore, as the Naoroz is near at hand, and I have postponed this matter pending receipt of your Excellency’s reply, if the Ministers of the Persian Government have, as before, nonobjection to the appointment of an Afghan Commercial Agent at Meshed, then the Afghan merchants will carry on their business as usual. Otherwise your Excellency will kindly inform me, so that I may instruct the Afghan merchants to close all their business in Persia after the Naoroz, and carry it on at Askabad, Merv, and Panjdeh.

Inclosure in No. 1. Summary of Frontier News from March 16 to April 15, 1896. Meshed.—Mr. Ney Elias reports that the affairs of Khorassan are once more in a deplorable condition, and that trouble may be the result. Religious students are attempting to stir up hostility against the Russians, and, should they succeed in their object, the Russian Consul-General would have a pretext of sending to Ashkabad for Cossacks and infantry soldiers. When once these soldiers were in Meshed, it would be very difficult to turn them out. Rut the hostility of the lower classes of Meshed is not only directed against the Russians. A certain Haji Mirza Zain-ul-Abidin has put himself at the head of an ignorant rabble, and is inciting them against the British Agency. He was the ringleader of the agitation against the Tobacco Regie, and was expelled from the town for attempting to create a disturbance. Mr. Elias states that he has taken steps to check Zain-ul-Abidin, but says that there is, without doubt, much anti-British feeling in Meshed just now. Bokhara. —It is rumoured that the Ameer of Bokhara is in correspondence with the Ameer of Afghanistan in the hopes of obtaining his assistance, in which case a serious revolt against the Russians might take place in the Khanates. Mohammerah .—Reports from the Karun state that there has been a heavy rainfall, more than sufficient to insure a large grain crop. The corn embargo is stated to be practically removed. In Tehran, in Meshed, in Tabriz, in Ispahan, and, indeed, in all the large towns of Persia, great discontent has been caused by the continued increase in the coining of copper and the consequent depreciation in the value of the “ Pul-i-Siah,” or black money. Large quantities of copper have recently been imported into the country, and considerable plunder has doubtless been carried off by the Mintmaster and other high officials. The evil is especially felt by the poorer classes, whose dealings are almost exclusively carried on in copper money. At the end of last month the kran was fixed at 30 shahis instead of 20, which had been its nominal value. The order was after wards revoked, and the kran fixed at 25 shahis. The Government has now authorized the Imperial Bank to buy in 100,000 tomans, or 20,000/. of copper money, at 25 shahis to the kran. The corporation of merchants have also undertaken to buy in 30,000 tomans of copper money, and the Mint has been refarmed at a rent of 36,000 tomans a-year, with the condition that no copper should be coined for five years.

He called to express to me his fear that, in consequence of the weakness of the new Shah’s character and the Hussian proclivities of his entourage, the influence of Itussia may become supreme in Persia. It appears, from what he told me, that a letter was written at the instigation of the late Yahia Khan hy the late Shah, with his own hand, to Prince Dolgorouki, which letter was almost tantamount to a recognition of the Protectorate of Russia over Persia. Yahia Khan’s downfall was brought about hy this, and the Sadr Azam, by authority of the Shah, declared that if Russia attempted in any way to make use of the document the Shah’s dethronement would ensue. The Russian Government may now, in the opinion of the Persian Minister, make use of this document in. oidei to influence the new Shah, and he hopes that Her Majesty’s Government, in their own as well as in Persia’s interests (which he regards as identical), will make an energetic use of their influence in order to prevent Russia from obtaining complete control oier Peisia, winch would he equally detrimental to Persia and Great Britain.

In return they have both protested their loyalty. I have instructed the Consul-General at Tabriz to recognize the Yaliahd, and to offer him my congratulations. No telegram has been received from India, and the Consul-General had to act without delay. I gave the same advice to the Zil-es-Sultan as I had given to the Naib, and in reply he has assured me of his resolve to keep his province in good order, and that he will loyally recognize his brother’s succession. It would have a very good effect were the Queen or your Lordship to send a direct personal telegram of condolence and recog nition to the Valiahd, and I think it would be well were some reference made to his action in keeping the Sadr-i-Azam as Prime Minister.

IN order that the safety of Europeans in Shiraz, Tabriz, and other places should not be endangered ready money is wanted to pay the troops and to meet other expenses. The loan of 20,000/. which has been advanced by the Directors of the Imperial Bank is not enough for the purpose. As dangerous consequences may be the result of delay I have sanctioned the advance of further loans by the Manager of the Bank. I hope this action will meet with your Lordship’s approval. I will be careful that the sums expended are not unduly large, and it would not be right to allow disturbances to take place which could be prevented by the expenditure of a moderate sum. No, 3.

The Consular Corps were present, and Mr. Wood offered the Shah cordial congratula tions on my behalf. The Sadr-i-Azam is doing very well. I found him confident and quiet when I discussed the situation with him to-day. It is unfortunate that the Shah delays his departure.

I found him in his garden near the outskirts of the town, in a pitiful state of fear and anxious for my advice. . 1 told him I could only give him personal advice, from myself, but I recommended him to telegraph at once to the Valiahd, assuring the latter of his loyalty and asking for orders. I also advised him to keep the town quiet.. The Naib seemed inclined to listen to my advice, but he is quite useless through fear. While still with the Naib I received a message from the Sadr-i-Azam asking me to come to the Shah’s Palace. The Russian Charge d Affaires came at the same time as I did, and we found the Sadr-i-Azam, the Shah’s brothers, and the Chief Officers of State assembled there. We were asked to come to the telegraph . office m the Palace in order to communicate with the Valiahd at Tabriz. The Valiahd, after he had been informed of the names of the persons present, sent a dignified and suitable message, calling upon the Princes, Ministers, and officials to support him, and desiring the Sadr-i-Azam to remain permanently as Prime Minister.

In closure in No. 1. Summary of Frontier News, February 19 to March 16, 1896. Tabriz. —Mr. Wood reports from Tabriz that several Turkish subjects have lately been sent across the border to the neighbourhood of Tabriz with a view of fomenting disturbances between the Persians and Armenians. Persons have also come from Tehran disguised as pedlars with the same object, but both missions are reported to have been fruitless. The Kurds on the frontier are said to be meditating a descent in force upon Persian territory in the spring. Res A/.—The Rcsht road is making but little progress. The Russian Consul appears very jealous of any intercourse between the engineers employed on it and Mr. Churchili, and has forbidden M. Bostellman, the engineer, to visit him. He has, moreover, set a spy in Mr. Churchill’s house. Meshed. —Mr. Elias reports that the present Governor of Khorassan, the A.sif-ud- Dowleh, is likely to be retained in office for another year. He was lately summoned to the Telegraph Office by the Sadri Azam, and requested to pay 50,000 tomans into the Imperial Treasury as a condition for his continuation in office. He appears to be reduced to great financial straits, judging from his correspondence with the Central Government. He lately telegraphed that he could dispose of two titles of General, one Shah’s portrait, and a few titles and commissions of Colonel for 2,000/. He was authorized to raise the money as suggested, but was informed that only a cheque payable at sight, and no promissory note, would be accepted. Sheikh Juneid .—It is reported that the Russians propose making a line from Merv to Penjdeh and thence to Sheikh Juneid, and that operations are to be commenced in the spring. Bokhara .—A concentration of Russian troops at Bokhara is reported, owing, it is said, to a disturbance which has taken place at Shahr-i-Sabz, a place in the neighbour hood. The Ameer is reported to have been fined 100,000 roubles, and to have been ordered to remain for a year at Shahr-i-Sabz. Afghanistan .—Considerable discontent with the Ameer’s Government is reported amongst the Afghan frontier tribes. Several obnoxious taxes have been imposed, amongst which may be mentioned a differential marriage tax, amounting to 12 krans on widows and to 24 khrans on spinsters, and a bachelor tax incident upon all bachelors from the age of 7.

Durand to the Marquess of Salisbury.—{Received March 23.) (No. 14.) My Lord, Tehran, February 12, 189G. I HAVE reported by telegram the progress and conclusion of the late disturbances in Ispahan, and I have little more to say on the subject. The facts of the case seem quite clear. On the evening of the 17th January two Persians, who were employed as night watchmen on the premises occupied by Messrs. Hotz, shut themselves into a small room warmed by a charcoal fire. They were found next day dead from asphyxia. Such occurrences are common enough in Persia, but on this occasion the friends of the deceased chose to represent that they had been murdered by Mr. Collignon, Messrs. Hotz' manager in Ispahan. The cry was taken up by the populace, and encouraged by the Mullas, and at one time there was some danger that Mr. Coliignon’s house might be forced. If this had happened, the Europeans who had assembled there would have been roughly bandied, and there might have been loss of life. The Zil-es- Sultan, however, succeeded in restraining the mob, and eventually the European firms, whose business had been interrupted for several days, were able to reopen their offices. It was a rather curious feature of the case that the British and Russian Legations were throughout acting in concert. The firm of Hotz is, as your Lordship knows, under British protection ; but the employes of the firm, being Dutchmen, are, in the absence of the Dutch Charge d’Affaires, under the protection of the Russians. In these circumstances, though I did not like the idea of Russian intervention in the affairs of Ispahan, I had no resource but to associate the Russian Charge dAffaires with myself, and to concert with him the action to be taken by the two Legations. He seemed inclined at first to argue that Her Majesty’s Legation had nothing to do with the matter, but soon abandoned this position, and was afterwards friendly and helpful. The two Legations jointly refused to entertain the demands of the Mullas, forwarded to me by the Shah, that Mr. Collignon should be expelled from Ispahan, that blood-money should be paid to the heirs of the deceased, and that Mr. Collignon’s Armenian servants should be surrendered for punishment. J believe the complete accord between the two Legations made a considerable impression upon the Shah, who is not accustomed to see them acting together, and very much dislikes it. I am not sure what the Zil-es-Sultan’s action in the matter has been. The Sadr-i- Azam says he got up the whole thing in order to induce the Shah to give him more troops. Mr. Preece, on the other hand, while admitting that the Prince turned the incident to his advantage in this respect, as he does everything else, is firmly convinced that he exerted himself in the most active way to put down the disturbance, and that he was very determined in his attitude towards the Muilas. Certainly his attitude towards us has of late been very much more cordial, and I think it quite possible that he was acting properly throughout. There can be no doubt that he or his subordinates restrained the mob from forcing Mr. Collignon's house. The Shah acted in his usual timid way; and when we refused to pay blood-money, he authorized the Zil-es-Sultan to pay it on his behalf; about 600/. was accordingly distributed to the Mullas. I need hardly say that a very small portion of this sum, if any, reached the heirs of the deceased. It is reported that the Ispahan Mullas are now trying to stir up the Mullas of Tehran, and to bring about a general combination against the Europeans. This Hll probably fail, but there may be further disturbances in Ispahan. I would add that Mr. Preece showed himself cool and steady throughout the recent troubles. If he had been timid or excitable, matters might have ended differently ; and I think he deserves credit for setting a good example to the European community, almost all of whom seem to have behaved well. r ft-p (Signed) ’ li. M. DURAND. [1018 x—X]2 ]No. 2. Consul Churchill to the Marquess of Salisbury.—(Received March 23.) (No. 1.) My Lord, Resht, February 22, 1896. NEARLY three months have elapsed since the date of my despatch No. 3 of the 30th November, 1895, when 1 reported that the Russian Company constructing the Enzelli-Tehran road had begun operations. Mr. Bostelman’s expectations of rapid progress in repairing the existing road from Peri Bazar to Imamzadeh Hashem have been disappointed. This piece of road is some 30 to 35 miles in length, and has been used for wheeled traffic during the last twenty- years. It was in a bad state of disrepair it is true, but all that the Company have apparently done so far is to clear away the mud and flatten the surface preparatory to its being macadamized ; the latter operation will be undertaken as soon as the machinery on its way arrives, and when stone can be brought from the foot of the hills some 30 miles from here. Work has been delayed by torrential rains in November, and by snow in February, that lay to the extent of over 4 feet on the road for over ten days. Operations on the most difficult part of the road, where blasting will enter largely into the programme, will be commenced in spring. I am informed that, till the beginning of this month, the expenses of the road came to about 3,000Z., or an average of 100/. per verst, for clearing and repairing in a perfunctory manner the existing road. Some 10 miles of this kind of work still remains to be done. I understand that the greater part of the machinery, such as steam-rollers, steam- saw, and others, as well as labourers’ implements, have been ordered in England. The steam-dredgers for Enzelli were ordered in Holland. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) HARRY L. CHURCHILL.[This Document is the Property of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government.] NO. 7.

My Lord, ^ ^ _ Tehran, January 22, 18S6. I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith a Report by Mr. Consul Churchill on his visit to Astrabad in October 1895. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. DURAND. Inclosure in No. 1. Report on a Visit to Astrabad by Consul Churchill in October 1895. I LETT Resht on the 5th October, learning that a trading steamer was starting from Enzeli the same day for Mazanderan. His Excellency the Beglerbegee, the Farmer of the Customs, was visiting the Mazanderan ports by that opportunity. Leaving Enzeli at 7'30 p.m., we arrived at Meshedi Ser the next evening, and landed at 10 o’clock. The wind rising, I deemed it advisable to land all my baggage for fear of not being able to re-embark the next day. The Beglerbegee, whose guest I had been on board, remained at Meshedi Ser. The wind having died out in the night, 1 was able to go on board the next morning. This vessel, the 4&lt; Mikhail/’ belonging to Mussulmans, is the smallest and filthiest and most crowded vessel it has ever been my fortune to travel on. She had on board over 100 souls, including the crew. She is British built, J. and W. Dudgeon, of London, being the builders, and she is 21 years old. She is of about 150 tons burden, and her speed is said to be 7 knots. Her captain is a Tatar, who knows his work more or less by long practice. One of his strong points is apparently the use of the steam-whistle. Me at length arrived at Bander-i-Gez about midnight, and landed without any mishap, for which the passengers, including some seventy pilgrims, had to be thankful, for there were but two miserable skiffs to resort to in case of accidents. I was agreeably surprised at Bander-i-Gez by the sight of a new pier on piles, which has lately been constructed; it is some 300 yards in length. The firm of Paniantz have built a fine house at the end of the pier, also on piles. This was because the Persian Government refused to permit them to purchase land to build on ; they have therefore built their house on the sea, over which presumably the Persians have no control. The firm is under Russian protection. A couple of steamers were in harbour as well as several schooners. A Russian gun-boat was also riding at anchor close to the shore. She had been at Gez some three weeks. This vessel is usually at Ashurada, the well-known Russian military station at the entrance of the bay. Trade at Bander-i-Gez is in a generally flourishing condition, raw cotton and dried fruit being the principal items of export; sugar, piece-goods, crockery, and petroleum those of import. 1 learned at Gez that since the arrival of the new Governor, the Prince Ameer Tehan Serdar, the road between Gez and Astrabad was quite safe, and that there was no fear of Turkomans, and that it was unnecessary for me to be attended by a special escort, as heretofore. I consequently only took a couple of men with me as guides, and the road being dry, I did the'8 farsakhs (32 miles) in five and a-half hours. On my arrival at Astrabad T exchanged visits with the authorities and my Russian colleague. The town of Astrabad is tranquil, and there seems to be no more fear of Turkoman raids, reprisals, or fights in the neighbourhood of the town. [1018 m—1]9 The villagers cultivate their lands in peace, and all the way up one’s eye met numerous crops of cotton, fruit, and rice; one saw villagers going about in groups of two and three, and quite unarmed. Three years ago this was impossible. There are some 150 people at Astrabad, natives of Kurrum and Tur, who claim British protection. They are of a very low class, and very poor; some have inhabited the neighbourhood for fifteen and twenty years, and have been generally oppressed by the local authorities. Colonel Stewart, C.B., while Consul at Astrabad, protected some of these people, and since the Protectorate extended to the Kurrum Valley, the British Agent has been instructed by Her Majesty’s Legation to protect all natives of that place. It would perhaps be advisable to issue certificates of registration to these people, such as those issued to all British subjects residing in Persia, and it is with a view to consulting your Excellency on the subject that 1 have, with your sanction, caused the British Agent to accompany me to Tehran. A number of these persons came originally as pilgrims to Kerbela and Meshed, and, their funds being exhausted, would have remained at Meshed, but the numbers of mendicants in that city being enormous and the winters cold, they wandered down to the milder clime of Astrabad, where they have elected to stay. They hire themselves out as outdoor labourers, and, when they can afford it, purchase an ass, load it with wood in the jungle, and sell it in the town, and thus earn wherewith to feed themselves and their families, whom many have brought with them. Numbers of these persons would return to their homes had they the means to do so. The Russian Consul is building a new Consulate to the south-west of the town close to the wall, and not far from the Government Palace. The house is not yet complete, but it promises to be an imposing building, with fine large rooms and ample space for the reception of a numerous staff and guests. It is situated in vast grounds, with a fine uninterrupted view ot the Elburz mountains, which are quite close to Astrabad. The water supply is on the Kabriz or Kanat system, and reaches this spot first hand. A Russian architect was employed to plan and superintend the buildings. The property belongs to the Saad-ed-Dowleh, the father of the Nasr-es-Sultaneh, and over 10,000 tomans have already been expended. It is estimated that it will cost 5,000 tomans more before the work will be completed. The rent to be paid is 80 imperials, or, at the present rate of exchange, 320 tomans per annum. This sum does not satisfy the proprietor, who seems indisposed to furnish any further funds to proceed with the work, and, as the roof is not yet on, it is evident that there are difficulties before them. Since the Prince Governor’s arrival at Astrabad some seven months ago, it is reported that he has levied some 20,000 tomans from the different Turkoman tribes on account of the property raided or stolen by them during the late adminis tration of the Amid-ed-Dowleh. A Turkoman named Kara-kul, a notorious robber of the Jaafer-bai tribe, who had refused to comply with the Serdar’s orders, was chased by men of his own tribe, and after several skirmishes, not without some bloodshed, was caught; he was brought before the Serdar at Ak-Kaleh, who ordered his immediate execution in his presence; he was forthwith decapitated, and the body was thrown into the Gurgan. The tribe was permitted to carry away the body, which was buried with much ceremony, it is said, and they consider him a martyr, placing offerings on the tomb, and treat it with much respect. Another Turkoman, Adina Mohamed, had killed an Astrabadi, named Esa, not far outside the town on the very day of the Serdar’s State entry into Astrabad. The man fled into Russian territory ; he was captured by the Russian authorities, and handed over to the Prince, with the understanding that he would be delivered to his people under certain pecuniary conditions. He was placed in prison, together with several other Turkomans. Adina Mohamed, it is averred, died a natural death in prison. The man’s relatives suspected that he had been poisoned, but I learn from both my Russian colleague and other excellent authority that he died of dysentery, several of the other prisoners having had the same disease. The Russian post of Kari-kala till recently was garrisoned by about 200 troops, composed of cavalry and infantry. During the last month this force has been increased to 700 or 800 men. It is supposed that the object is to punish the Charvai of the Kujuk and Kan Yakhmaz tribes, who are Persian subjects, but are continually crossing the frontier, and robbing travellers and merchants and stealing- cattle. The Russians have, it is stated, applied time after time to the Persianfrontier authorities to put a stop to these incursions, with the only result of copious promises never fulfilled. The general impression now prevailing in Astrabad is that the Russians are awaiting an opportunity to fall upon these Turkomans, and inflict exemplary punishment themselves. The Prince Governor has recently prohibited the export of rice from the Astrabad Province. Purchasers had already arrived to obtain this year’s crop, but it is presumed that they will not succeed to any considerable extent. fhe Serdar had previously prohibited the sale and export of grain by the Turkomans to Russia, and had added that all they possessed for sale was to be brought and sold at Astrabad, where there was a scarcity. Most of the grain is now brought to that city, to the pecuniary loss of the producers, who obtain a lower price in Astrabad than they would in Russia. The following troops are in camp at present at Astrabad : — The Tehran regiment, under Mahmoud Khan Mir Panj (800 men). 200 of these are at Ak-Kaleh. Of the 600 remaining, perhaps 400 are in camp. 200 Cossack cavalry, under Sefer Ali Khan Mir Panj. Irregular cavalry— 200 Shahsavend Kurtbegloo. 100 Karachuloo. Some 150 Nana-kelle horsemen are with the Serdar at Bastam. Besides the above, Ameer Khan Serdar arrived with the Semnan Damghan regiment of infantry and 100 sowars of Gowdaree-i-Bastam ; these have since been dismissed to their homes. The local irregular cavalry is, of course, available in case of necessity, but they area’ll dispersed all over the province. The Arab Ajem regiment of Shahrood and Bastam has been disbanded in con sequence of their recent misconduct in Khorassan, when they refused to proceed to Kelat-i-Nadiri. The Serdar, who also holds the appointment of Governor of Shah rood and Bastam, is now enlisting men to form a new regiment. Deeming it necessary to visit the Prince Governor, l decided to proceed to Tehran via Shahrood. The Prince telegraphed orders that an escort and some of his own attendants should accompany me to Shahrood. I therefore had a guard of four Persian Cossacks and a couple of the Prince’s Peeshkhedmets. At Tash I was forcibly delayed by a storm on the 17th October. The altitude of this place is some 7,500 feet. The whole village of 150 houses was completely destroyed by an earth quake five years ago, when over 100 women were killed in the village bath alone, besides many persons who lost their lives in the houses.' The village has been rebuilt on the same spot and in the same manner as before, i.e., mud. On my arrival near Bastam 1 was met by the Serdar’s Secretary with a guard of honour of some thirty horsemen, and a led horse with gold trappings. The Serdar’s carriage was sent out to this spot, and I drove into Bastam in State. The Serdar, whom I have known during the last sixteen years, was most cordial, and placed his house, in a large garden outside the town, at my disposal, and himself took up his residence with his Moonshee Bashi. The Serdar’s version of the Kari-kala movement is different to the one I have already reported above, and is worth recording, as showing the official view of it. He tells me that the Charvai, who cross from Persian to Russian territory, have repeatedly been requested to swear allegiance to the Emperor; but this they have invariably refused to do: this action would seem, indeed, to have produced the contrary effect, for the Serdar affirms that some 600 or more families of Russian Turkomans have recently migrated to Persian territory. The Russians have conse quently strengthened their force at Kari-kala. Surmises of the motives for this increase of troops on the frontier are fruitful; some imagine that it is in order to put a stop to further migration, and others that it is to prevent Persian Charvais from crossing the frontier unless they make allegiance to Russia. To resume the whole position of affairs in Astrabad, it is, in my opinion, absolutely necessary to strengthen the Governor’s hand by supplying the necessary troops, i.e., some 4,000 men, half being infantry and half cavalry ; that these troops be regularly paid, drilled, and supplied with uniforms, arms, and ammunition in sufficient quantities. In Europe such details would not require to be mentioned, and would go without saying, but in this country it is far from the case. Unless this is done, it is much to be feared that Astrabad will again fall into its pristine state of lawlessness, and will be overrun by Turkoman hordes.4 o I would here add that, by his energetic action and strong sense of justice, Ameer Khan Serdar has succeeded where others, and even he himself in former years, had failed. It would be unwise in the Persian Government if they removed him before the expiration of at least two years, and even then if he were to insist on being relieved of his appointment, for it is known that he was sent to Astrabad against his will, he should be replaced by an equally conscientious, strong, and painstaking official, qualities which I must admit are somewhat rare among the present candidates for the post. I must here add that the suggested dam, already much spoken of, which should be constructed at the spot where the Gurgan separates into two, should be begun, and FI is Majesty the Shah should be urged to supply the necessary funds to cause the works to be commenced without delay : the supply of fresh water to Gumush Tepe is a most important matter, the want of which might be the cause of the loss of many useful Yemoot Turkoman families, who would necessarily migrate to Russian territory, where there is a plentiful supply of water for their flocks and crops.

It is unfortunate that no British capitalists seem disposed to take up the question of the southern roads, for it seems probable that Russian and German enterprise in the north may, if not counteracted by British enterprise in the south, tend to push back our commercial frontier, and to exclude us from large tracts where we might reasonably have hoped to open up fresh markets.

HIS Most august Majesty, Ruler and Shahin Shah of all Persia, has consented to give the Company of the Enzeli-Kasvin Chaussee road the right of cleaning the Strait of Enzeli on the conditions set out in the following Articles :— Article 1. The works which are to be carried out by the Company are : cleaning and deepening the Strait of Enzeli and drawing a wall across the sea for the protection and defence of the entrance against the sea waves and building a light house on the wall for facilitating the entrance of ships at night. A line drawn from the Strait to the west of the Custom-house will serve as the extreme limit for the Company’s works. The construction of harbour buildings, such as depots, wharves, and everything that may be necessary, and which is now wanting is at the charge of the Persian Government and has nothing to do with the Company! Art. 2. The Company at the completion of the works will levy, for its own benefit, a money toll from. ships, on a scale fixed by a Commission composed of Representatives of the Persian Government, of the Russian Legation at Tehran, and of the Enzeli and Kasvin Road Company. In any case the amount of this toll must be calculated in such a Avay that the net profits of the Company do not exceed 10 per cent, per annum. Payment of these dues, with the exception of the lighthouse toll, Avill not of course be demanded from ships remaining in the open roadstead. The Company Avill enjoy the right of levying the above-mentioned dues for a period of seventy-five years, provided the works carried out by them are maintained in proper order. At the expiration of this period all the works carried out by the Company will be taken (sequestered) by the Persian Government. [1018 m—2]2 Art. 3. The “ kerezis ” (boats) belonging to the local inhabitants along the banks of the Gulf of Enzeli will be afforded a free passage along the sea road made by the Company, provided they observe the rules laid down by the Company for the use of this road. Art. 4. By order of the Persian Government the Company will be exempted from the payment of customs duties on machines and all kinds of material imported from Europe and necessary for carrying out the work of improving the Enzeli Harbour, and also on material brought for the same purpose from various parts of Persia. The Custom-house officials Avill have the right of examining loads, to the end that there may be no articles of commerce among them. Art. 5. The Company may like others keep “ barhases ” (lighters) and cargo- boats (“ caiques ”), both steam and not steam, necessary for the transport of goods and passengers, but these may not go outside the limits of the Enzeli Harbour. ]st Jemaddinsoani, 1313 {November 17, 1895).

THE Herat Agent gives a very unsatisfactory account of the state of feeling in the northern part of the Herat Province. It appears there is much discontent among the troops, who, though all Cabulis, have been stationed at Herat for some twelve years continuously, and are unable to obtain their relief. The Sipah Salar is thought to be thoroughly loyal to the Ameer, hut has little control over his own men. On the northern frontier the Agent regards the general feeling as very pro- Russian, the local officials being in constant communication with the Russians at Panjdeh, whilst the nomad tribesmen of Kalla Naw, Jamshidis, Timuris, Firozkuhis, and Hazaras are saturated with Russian ideas. Discontent with the Ameer’s rule along this frontier is said to have never been so intense as at present. The Agent regards the tension now as very great, and compares the situation to that of 1887, when Ayub Khan was at large in Persia. Sarakhs.

I HAVE the honour to forward to your Lordship herewith a Report which I have received from Mr. Preece, Her Majesty’s Consul at Ispahan, on a journey through the Bakhtiari. country to Shuster. T have (Signed) ’ H. M. DURAND. Inclosure in No. 1. Extracts from Consul Preece's Report on his Journey through the Bakhtiari Country to Shuster. (Secret.) THE Bakhtiaris are now governed by Hajji Imam Kuli Khan as Eel Khaneh. He is a brother of the late Eel Khaneh Houssein Kuli Khan, who was murdered by the Zil-es-Sultan in 1882. He is an old man, over 70, bent with years, and very feeble. The real man of affairs, who practically governs the tribes, is Isfcndiar Khan, known as Samsam-es-Sultaneh, son of the late Houssein Kuli Khan. He treats Hajji Imam Kuli Khan with much respect, and consults with him on all tribal matters, but it is easy to see that his is the dominant mind. Isfendiar Khan is a man of medium height, of clear, open countenance, and pleasing, gentlemanly address, somewhat staid and deliberate in manner, at times, however, breaking out into a frank, open way of talking, mixed with a good deal of humour. His extreme staidness is to be accounted for by his having passed a large portion of his life more or less a prisoner, first in Tehran as a hostage for the good conduct of his father, and then, after his murder, for seven years as a prisoner. He is extremely well thought of by the Bakhtiaris as a just Chief, and at present they all acknowledge him as their leader. Should Isfendiar Khan disappear, the tribes w'ould break up again into their several divisions, and return to the state of anarchy usual except when he is at their head. Reza Kuli Khan, another brother of the late Houssein Kuli Khan, and his son, the Zergham-es-Sultaneh, who were up to about a year ago in power, are a pair of rapacious, cruel men. They greatly oppressed the tribes, were the instruments of the Zil-es- Sultan in dealing with the sons of the late Eel Khaneh ; all were glad to see their backs when they lately bolted to Tehran. The majority of their followers have given in their adhesion to Isfendiar Khan. They have, however, left some twenty men behind them at Paradamba purely for purposes of robbery, and these men now keep the road from here to Shiraz in a state of ferment. The Zil-es-Sultan always says it is the men of Ispendiar Khan who are robbing. On my return from Chichakhor I made searching inquiries wherever I could, and found that beyond doubt it was the men of the Zergham-es- Sultaneh who were in fault. I saw two sons of Hajji Imam Kuli Khan, Sultan Mohammed Khan and Mahmud Khan, both extremely nice, frank, outspoken young fellows, full of talk and very pleasant. Of Isfendiar Khan’s brothers, I met Nejef Kuli Khan, Hajji Ali Kuli Khan, Amir Kuli Khan, and Yusuf Khan. Nejef Kuli Khan is a very fine man, the image of his late father. He is reputed to be very brave and a good leader. Hajji Ali Kuli Khan is the clever man of the family. He is interested in the antiquities of the country, and is anxious to trace back the Bakhtiari to their origin. He reads French. As a ruler of the tribesmen, I should judge that he is not far inferior to his brother Isfendiar Khan. Hajji Khosroes Khan I [1018 2] B2 did not see. He is in Tehran with the Bakhtiari Horse. Hajji AH Kuli Khan goes there shortly to relieve him. _ . The Chaab-es-Sultaneh, Hajji Imam Kuli Khan’s son, I did not see eithei, as ne is now in Arabistan in command of the contingent ot Bakhtiari Horse there, and also in assisting the Nizam-es-Sultaneh in his duties. He is far and away the most capaile oi the Eel Khaneh’s sons. In speaking to various Bakhtiaris I met, they, in reply to my questions, seemed to think that of all these Khans there were only three worthy ot consideiation, i.e., Isfendiar, Nejef, and Hajji Ali Kuli. The former was described as the good political man, able to deal with the Government in Tehran, Ispahan, 01 Aiabistan. In a word, that he was the man for government par excellence. Kejef Kuli Khan was the man for the Bakhtiari, That is to say, he was the man for leading a raid, and would bring loot into the camp. Hajji Ali Kuli Khan was the learned or educated man. His knowledge and digging propen ities seemed to have gained him great respect. I was for three days their guest in their camp, and was treated quite like a friend, and in true Bakhtiari spirit, they used to come into my tents together or separately and sit and chatter lor hours, all in the most friendly way, utterly sans gene. Among themselves they seemed more like ourselves, friendly to a degree, addressing each other by name, joking and laughing, quite without the formal manner customary among Persians. It was altogether a pleasant revelation, I had one or two private talks with Isfendiar Khan together with Hajji Ali Kuli Khan; there was apparently no reserve in their behaviour towards each other, they seemed to be of one mind, and spoke on perfect equality. In the first case the conversation tamed on the question of making the road practical from Ispahan to Shuster. They said that they were quite willing and anxious to do anything that they could to facilitate such an end, it was what they all wanted. They quite saw how it would open up their country and improve the prospects of the tribes, and generally help to the much wished-for end of taking the tribesmen out of their wild state and civilize them. This was a traditional idea with the Khans. The little things I pointed out could be easily done, they said, the only one difficult question was the bridge, that to them was the stumbling-block. Although Hajji Ali Kuli Khan had taken this on himself, and for the tribe’s sake was anxious to do something, yet he did not see what he could do. If they built a bridge, got from England, the Govern ment would immediately assume that they were in an opulent state, and would increase their taxes. This was a question in which they wanted help. (A present of such a bridge as was necessary would be good policy, I think, if Her Majesty’s Government are willing to help the Bakhtiaris. Such a present, while adding to our prestige with them, would greatly assist our commercial interests, and would be of use in the future should occasion call on us to occupy this country. But if it was not thought advisable to give and build such a bridge, I believe I could, with the assistance of one of my old telegraph staff, now in Ispahan, Mr. McIntyre, build them a suspension bridge, on the lines of a military one, which would not cost very much; all that we should require would be some MO yards of 3^-inch steel wire rope, together with shackles, blocks, and tackles, &amp;c.; with native workmen and material we could, in a month or so, build them such a bridge as would very materially assist them and ourselves, and which, with ordinary care, would last many years.) The Bakhtiaris are ready to give any guarantees for the safety of all mer chandize, &amp;c., passing through their country ; they would build caravanserais, make the roads good wherever necessary, they would put on their own muleteers and mules, against all which they only would require a right to levy a regular tax, as is done in other parts of the country. It would have to be done in order, and a regular contract would have to be drawn out with them covering all these points. Hajji Ali Kuli Khan was going to Tehran in a few weeks to take over charge of the Bakhtiari Horse, and he would take a letter from Isfendiar Khan to the Minister, giving him authority to act in every way in this affair. Thus he would be an accredited agent of the Bakhtiari Chiefs with the Minister. They then went on to refer to some conversations they had had with Major Sawyer and General Gordon, in which reference had been made to the probability of our having use for them, that we might make a base of their country for military operations in the north, annex the Province of Arabistan, &amp;c. I gave them to understand that I had no knowledge of any such questions, and had no instructions to speak about them. As Hajji Ali Kuli Khan was going to Tehran he could say all that was necessary on the subject to the Minister.3 Nevertheless, they assured me of their allegiance to our interests, and their hope that we should find use for them in the not far distant future; the word had only to be given, and they would, with their whole tribe, be ready at once to throw themselves into our arms and do anything that was required of them. They were quite strong enough enough to take Ispahan at any moment, and would do so if we only said the word, and would hold it till we were ready to take it. They had no loyalty due to the Kajar family. The Shah only took such money as he could from them, and did nothing in exchange. Between them and the Zil-es-Sultan there was blood, and they owed him a bitter revenge for what he had done in wantonly killing their father, and ever since in sucking their life’s blood. While he had been in any ways acting as Governor over them his rule was one continual course of oppression, their villages and their own homes had all been ruined by him or by his orders. In the last year, the lax due to the Government, which was 35,000 tomans, i.e., 15,000 for the Bakhtiaris, and 20,000 for Chehar Mahal, he had taken a paper from them for 00,000 tomans, that is to say, 25,000 tomans in excess. It had not been been paid, nor would it be, as the Sadr Azam had pronounced it null and void. They had at the time told him it would be impossible to pay this extra tax, but he insisted, and tried to get them to give over to him their villages in Chehar Mahal. He also asserted, what was a lie, that they had 500,000 tomans stored up, and he wanted some of that. (I can quite credit this, as the Zil-es-Sultan’s rapacity at the present time is beyond bounds. He does anything and everything to acquire land and villages in these districts. I could fill sheets with tales of his oppression and extortion.) _ . They stated that they dreaded the idea, and looked forward with fear to the time when it was possible that the Zil-es-Sultan would again have them in charge. ^ He was at the present time doing all he could to discredit them, causing robberies on the main road by the Zergham-es-Sultaneh’s people, and accusing them of being the culprits; whilst even his own men, the Gholams, wdio are put as road guards, only lately robbed some Bakhtiaris, who had been to Tehran to sell their sheep, of some 1,700 tomans odd; they had complained to the Zil-es-Sultan, but could not get any redress; if he once got money into his hands, there w-as no getting it out again. (This story is true, I heard it before I left for Chichakhor.) Should the Zil-es-Sultan get the Bakhtiari country again, they would have no remedy but to go elsewhere, it would be impossible for them to remain under him. I made out that in case of its being necessary they could bring to the front, some 1,200 men, well mounted and armed. This number is made up of 200 of their own personal attendants, 500 Khaneh Zadeh (house-born), or their own tribesmen, and 500 men consisting of Chiefs of clans and their attendants. These 1,200 men could be ready at any spot in a fortnight. Beyond these they could collect a following from the tribes of at least 10,000 men, who would be partially horsemen and partially footmen. Their arms were somewhat heterogeneous. Also, if it were necessary, they could get a large following of Arabs and Lurs who acknowledged their supremacy. Altogether they could be reckoned on for something like 15,000 men. . .... I noticed that although most of the men I saw were armed with Martini rifles of English and Turkish manufacture, yet in some cases the mechanism was out of order and the guns of very ancient date. The ammunition was not good,, the cases had been used over and over again, and the powder was of Persian manufacture of very low ballisticity. , Kfl , Of the Bakhtiari Horse now outside their own country there were at present ol) at Tehran and 50 in Arabistan. These are horsed, armed, and clothed by the Bakhtiari At Shuster, Dizful, Khorremabad, and Burujird I did not find out anything of impor tance worth noting. All these Governments had only just been taken over by the new Governors, and were in a general state of chaos. . At Khorremabad some 100 soldiers were starting for a place in Luristan; the} weie armed with Werndl rifles, but from a conversation I heard between the Deputy Governor and the Colonel it was evident that the ammunition served out to them would not fit the o’UHS. &amp; There was nothing as far as I could see from Shuster to Khorremabad to prevent a wood road or even a railway being made. . . . The country is in no way difficult, certainly nothing to compare with various other countries I have seen which are served with railways. . But what struck me most was the capabilities of this line to carry an electric railway. Where rivers are available, there is no means more adapted for the economic transmission4 of power to drive railways; in this country this is pre-eminently the case. From iShuster, and therefore from Mohammerah to Sultanabad, this wai-r power was present at recurring points well within the range cf the limits of economic distribution. Thus at Shuster and below is the Karim ; then, at Diziul, the Diz ; beyond, the At-i-Zal; between this and Khorremabad the stream at Maklibarabad, the A hi sard, the Afrina, the Chames, and Shorab. Then the rivers of Khorremabad and the .Diz would be amply sufficient for the distance from Khorremabad to Burujird, thence to Sultanabad there is no lack of water, but at this last place, and thence to Tehran on the one side and Ispahan on the other the motive power would have to be steam, except at Ispahan. Such a scheme I am sure would be taken up in England at a moment’s notice, and I believe that in this case a light electric railway is the only one which would pay until the country was more fully developed. For such development there is ample room, whether it be by the natives or by colonization. The well-watered valleys of the Bakhtiari country and Luristan, even up to Irak, are eminently adapted for the latter, and would make splendid farm parcels ; they all lie high and are cool, and would be pleasant locations, so that our people could easily live and settle in them. The low lands of Arabistan only want a little interest shown in them, and some money spent on proper tillage, and intelligent repairs of the Band of Shuster, to have it returned a hundred-fold in a very short space of time. The country would soon return to its bygone prosperity, and once again would be one of the richest provinces in Persia. Against the development of the roads to Tehran and Ispahan, one of the main obstacles is the vis inertia or conservatism of the European merchants. Although they are perpetually crying out about the stagnation of trade, the increase of freight, and the want of carriage from the seaboard to the trade centres, yet nothing I can do or say will induce them to give these routes a trial; they really are like children, and want every thing done for them. It seems to me that the old class of merchants, pushing and progressive, such as one knew in the country some twenty years, no longer exists. They now object that they have no control over their goods, that postal and telegraphic com munication between Shuster or Ahwaz and here is doubtful and uncertain, the post takes weeks, and telegrams sometimes are undelivered, or only delivered after advice by post arrives. That carriage is uncertain, the flow would all practically be one way. That against robberies or pilfering there are no guarantees as on the main lines. That to supervise their goods they would have to have agents at Ahwaz or Shuster, the point of departure, to see that the goods were not sea-damaged, and so on, with any and every excuse they can think of. In bright contrast to this conduct is the go-ahead policy of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, who seem determined to do all they can to push these roads, and with this end in view I understand are about to open a house here for forwarding business. With all due respect, I would submit that, to attain the permanent opening up of these roads, and to maintain the stability of our trade in the country, it becomes imperative on us to uphold Isfendiar Khan and his brothers in power in the Bakbtiari country and Chehar Mahal, and on no account to suffer the Zil-es-Sultan again to get a footing there. The Zil-es-Sultan got the Bakhtiaris added to his Govern ment by Sir I rank Lascelles, and signalized his term of power by oppressing them and sucking every kran he could from them. I cannot but admit that in the old days the whole of the south of the country when in the hands of this Prince was kept in splendid order, and that travelling along the roads or in his country was everywhere safe; but the Zil-es-Sultan of those days and the Zil-es-Sultan of to-day are tw r o different individuals. Then he was a great man with large ideas, although at times spoilt by Persian ways ; now he has developed all the worst Kajar traits, and has become avaricious and grasping to a degree; his only r idea is to get money, and he does not care how he gets it. But I venture to go somewhat beyond this point of preventing the Zil-es- Sultan having anything to do with the Bakhtiari country'. I think we should have a hand in the nomination of all Governorships in the south, certainly of such as are in any' way concerned in our trade routes, such as, for instance, Arabistan and Luristan, bars and Ispahan, Kerman and Yezd. These Governors should be our friends, and they should understand that only so long as they assist us in our trade will they be tolerated as Governors, and that no one who was known to be in any way inimical to our interests would have a chance of any one of these Governments. If this was followed out we should soon see what an effect it would have on our interests in many ways. Only' so long as w r e arc supported in such a vny can we hope to combat the Russian advance in Persian markets. English trade, as far as I can estimate here, is almost daily declining in Persia, and unless some radical measures are taken to stop this decline it will reach a vanishing point.-in~&gt; (5o) 5 I do not know if there are any stringent political reasons why the Vice-Consul should be stationed at Mohammerah; as far as I could judge he does not, commercially speaking, appear to he of much use there. I should feel inclined to move him to Shuster or Dizful, where he would find some useful work to do. Another point where a Vice-Consul would be most advantageous is Sultanabad, with powers over Khorremabad and Burujird, even it might be extending to Kermanshah and Hamadan. But he should not be a stay-at-home man, but one who would itinerate, and remain a month or two at a time at the above spots. There is plenty of room for good work at all these places. In conclusion, I am led to believe that there are openings for us in the country, and much good and valuable work is to be done, but that the whole question is in our own hands, and it lies with the Government to say whether these openings shall be utilized and trade pushed. (Signed) J. ft. PR EEC E. Summary. — Roads. It now only remains for me to summarize and submit for consideration such deduc tions and ideas as I have arrived at on this journey as will lead to or assist in arriving at a conclusion whereby these roads can be made suitable to carry British trade, and so induce the trader to utilize them. Between Ispahan and Shuster there are three points on the road which will have to altered before it can be considered a proper caravan one, open to the transit of British mercantile goods. The first is the Pul-i-Amarat. This bridge should certainly be made a permanent and effective one on the higher level, and not open to being carried away, as it is now, by any flooding of the river. Secondly, the Pass of Mawarid, immediately after leaving the above bridge, should be put into better order by means of properly constructed zigzags, and the dangerous bit at the ladder, described in my Report, should be blasted and made thoroughly foot- sure for heavily laden animals ; at the present time it is quite the reverse, although it must be observed that this pass is only used for some six months in the year, the road in summer and autumn being by Rudbar, as followed by Colonel Wells. He, however, describes the drop from the plateau to the river as being very difficult and dangerous. If this Pass of Marawid was once made good, it is possible that the traffic would always keep to it. Thirdly, the Godar-i-Balutak. Here a bridge, or some more efficient mode of crossing than the present ferry, is imperatively necessary. Mercantile goods of a perishable nature would certainly be liable to damage, as very often the platform of the ferry is awash. The solution, without doubt, is a well-constructed bridge at the point where the Khans are now trying to make a sort of suspension bridge. Hajji Ali Kuli Khan is most anxious to build a bridge if he can possibly do it, as he says this ferry is most dangerous, and annually costs the Bakhtiaris from 50 to 200 lives and some 20,000 tomans’ worth of property. This is doubtless an exaggeration, but, nevertheless, the crossing now is made in a most primitive fashion, and has its dangers. In the long run a bridge of this kind would not only be the cheapest, but would be as effective as any other kind. There are other points of the road where a little clearing away of trees, boulders, and some modification of the gradients would largely add to its efficiency. But, taken on the whole, it is by no means a bad road; and if only the work indicated at the three points above was carried out, there is no reason why it should not be used for nine months in the year. In winter, during the other three months, this way is blocked; but that is, however, as a rule, only at one point, although in severe winters there are two other places which may be temporarily stopped by snow. The bad point is the Pass of Zirreh, together with the valley of Siligun, between Chichakhor and Hagun. This portion of the road is invariably impassable in winter; the pass would have to be turned, and the Tang-i Darkash-Warkash, to the north-east of Ardal, which carries off’ the drainage of Chehar Mahal to the Karun, would have to be used. At present it is a very rough road, only fit in winter for foot passengers; but a good and efficient road could be made along it at a small expense, the distance requiring making being only about 4 miles. [1018 6—2] C6 The other points sometimes closed by snow are the Godar-i-Barreh Mordeh and the Shikeft-i-Diz. These, I am told, could easily be opened again without much delay. Neither point is so high as several places on the road from Bushire to Tehran, and it is rarely that this portion of the road is blocked for more than a few days. Use would soon develop it here and at other points, and delays would become merely nominal. To facilitate the use of the road and to render supplies procurable, it would be necessary to build some few caravanserais. At Dopulan, Hilisat, and Pul-i-Amarat they would be absolutely necessary, not only for the above reason, but for shelter for the animals in winter. Shelters would also be necessary at points on the passes of the Barreh Mordeh and about the Shikett-i-Diz. At the other various stages the present occupants of the villages would build for their own profit as soon as they saw the road was being used to any extent. Beyond Mai Amir there is nothing to remark upon. The caravans now being sent by Messrs. Lynch no longer have Shuster as a starting-point, but are dispatched from Ahwaz, going via Ram Hormuz and thence to Kal’ah Tul and Mai Amir, thus obviating the extra trouble entailed in transhipment to the boat for the Upper Karun, &amp;c., with out materially increasing the land carriage. In making any arrangement for the opening of the road from Ispahan across the Bakhtiari country, guarantees would have to be given either by the Bakhtiari Chiefs or the Persian Government that due compensation for robberies would be given as is now done on the Bushire-Tehran road. Against this, and for the expense entailed in making the road practical, permission to charge a road tax would have to be given. From Shuster to Tehran there is but little to be done to make the road a really good one. As I have shown, the bad places have at their worst points been ameliorated, a little clearance of boulders and improvement of the road from the Balarud to the commence ment of the newly-made portion of the Kialan Pass and the last part of the descent to the Takht-i-Chun is all that is necessary, always excepting the restoration of the bridge at Shuster to facilitate caravan traffic, as in times of flood the river there is for some days impassable. Caravanserais have been made along the line at such points as are requisite; all that is now wanted is to place in them caretakers and the necessary supplies. The main deterrent to the use of this road is the robbing Lurs, who hitherto have kept it in a disturbed state. The remedy for this is in the hands of the Central Government. Strong, just, and liberal-minded Governors in Arabistan and Luristan would do all that is needful to this end. Under such conditions there is no reason, that I can see, why this road, should not become as much used and as well known as the present one between Bushire and Tehran. Restoration of the telegraph line from Dizful to Khorremabad and a renewal of post-horses would also be effective, but the first consideration is to keep the Lurs in proper subjection. Pilfering there may continually be, that is always going on, even on the main road, but absolute stoppage and looting of caravans, which up to the last few months was practically unknown on the Bushire-Tehran road, should be put a stop to ; then merchants will gain confidence, and will be glad to use the road, especially as now the main one has acquired an unenviable notoriety in that respect, also as owing to a murrain among the carrying animals in the south of Persia, hire has become very high, and so put the British quite out of the running in the competition with the Russian merchant in the northern m q fir (Signed) J.

[January 17.] Section 2. v Sir M. Durand to the Marquess of Salisbury.—(Received January 17, 1896.) (No. 102.) My Lord, Tehran, December 20, 1895. I HAVE the honour to forward to your Lordship herewith a Report which I have received from Mr. Preece, Her Majesty’s Consul at Ispahan, on a journey through the Bakhtiari country to Shuster. 1 n v tw c (Signed)' ’ H. M. DURAND. Inclosure in No. 1. Extracts from Consul Preece’s Report on his Journey through the Bakhtiari Country to Shuster. (Secret.) THE Bakhtiaris are now governed by Hajji Imam Kuli Khan as Eel Khaneh. He is a brother of the late Eel Khaneh Houssein Kuli Khan, who was murdered by r the Zil-es-Sultan in 1882. He is an old man, over 70, bent with years, and very feeble. The real man of affairs, who practically governs the tribes, is Isfendiar Khan, known as Samsam-es-Sulfaneh, son of the late Houssein Kuli Khan. He treats Hajji Imam Kuli Khan with much respect, and consults with him on all tribal matters, but it is easy to see that his is the dominant mind. Isfendiar Khan is a man of medium height, of clear, open countenance, and pleasing, gentlemanly address, somewhat staid and deliberate in manner, at times, however, breaking out into a frank, open way of talking, mixed with a good deal of humour. His extreme staidness is to be accounted for by his having passed a large portion of his life more or less a prisoner, first in Tehran as a hostage for the good conduct of his father, and then, after his murder, for seven years as a prisoner. He is extremely well thought of by the Bakhtiaris as a just Chief) and at present they all acknowledge him as their leader. Should Isfendiar Khan disappear, the tribes w r ould break up again into their several divisions, and return to the state of anarchy' usual except when he is at their head. Reza Kuli Khan, another brother of the late Houssein Kuli Khan, and his son, the Zergham-es-Sultaneh, who were up to about a year ago in power, are a pair of rapacious, cruel men. They greatly oppressed the tribes, were the instruments of the Zil-es- Sultan in dealing with the sons of the late Eel Khaneh ; all were glad to see their backs w'hen they lately bolted to Tehran. The majority of their followers have given in their adhesion to Isfendiar Khan. They have, however, left some twenty' men behind them at Paradamba purely for purposes of robbery, and these men now keep the road from here to Shiraz in a state of ferment. The Zil-es-Sultan always says it is the men of Ispendiar Khan who are robbing. On my return from Chichakhor I made searching inquiries wherever I could, and found that beyond doubt it was the men of the Zergham-es- Sultaneh who were in fault. I saw two sons of Hajji Imam Kuli Khan, Sultan Mohammed Khan and Mahmud Khan, both extremely nice, frank, outspoken young fellows, full of talk and very pleasant. Of Isfendiar Khan’s brothers, I met Nejef Kuli Khan, Hajji Ali Kuli Khan, Amir Kuli Khan, and Yusuf Khan. Nejef Kuli Khan is a very fine man, the image of his late father. He is reputed to be very brave and a good leader. Hajji Ali Kuli Khan is the clever man of the family. He is interested in the antiquities of the country, and is anxious to trace back the Bakhtiari to their origin. He reads French. As a ruler of the tribesmen, I should judge that he is not far inferior to his brother Isfendiar Khan. Hajji Khosroes Khan 1 [1018 b—2] Bo did not see. He is in Tehran with the Bakhtiari Horse. Hajji Ali Kuli Khan goes there shortly to relieve him. # . The Chaab-es^Sultaneh, Hajji Imam Kuli Khan’s son, I did not see either, as he is now in Arabistan in command of the conting’ent ot Bakhtiari Horse there, and also in assisting the Nizam-es-Sultaneh in his duties. He is far and away the most capable of the Eel Khaneh’s sons. In speaking to various Bakhtiaris I met, they, in reply to my questions, seemed to think that of all these Khans there were only three worthy ot consideration, i.e., Isfendiar, Nejef, and Hajji Ali Kuli. The former was described as the good political man, able to deal with the Government in Tehran, Ispahan, 01 Arabistan. In a word, that he was the man for government par excellence. Kejef Kuli Khan was the man for the Bakhtiari. That is to say, he was the man for leading a raid, and would bring loot into the camp. Hajji Ali Kuli Khan was the learned or educated man. His knowledge and digging propen ities seemed to have gained him great respect. I was for three days their guest in their camp, and was treated quite like a friend, and in true Bakhtiaii spiiit. Iliey used to come into my tents together or separately and sit and chatter for hours, all in the most friendly way, utterly sans gene. Among themselves they seemed more like ourselves, friendly to a degree, addressing each other by name, joking and laughing, quite without the formal manner customary among Persians. It was altogether a pleasant revelation. I had one or two private talks with Isfendiar Khan together with Hajji Ali Kuli Khan; there was apparently no reserve in their behaviour towards each other, they seemed to be of one mind, and spoke on perfect equality. In the first case the conversation turned on the question of making the road practical from Ispahan to Shuster. They said that they were quite willing and anxious to do anything that they could to facilitate such an end, it was what they all wanted. They quite saw how it would open up their country and improve the prospects of the tribes, and generally help to the much wished-for end of taking the tribesmen out of their wild state and civilize them. This was a traditional idea with the Khans. The little things I pointed out could be easily done, they said, the only one difficult question was the. bridge, that to them was the stumbling-block. Although Hajji Ali Kuli Khan had taken this on himself, and for the tribe’s sake was anxious to do something, yet he did not see what he could do. If they built a bridge, got from England, the Govern ment would immediately assume that they were in an opulent state, and would increase their taxes. This was a question in which they wanted help. (A present of such a bridge as was necessary would be good policy, I think, if Her Majesty’s Government are willing to help the Bakhtiaris. Such a present, while adding to our prestige with them, would greatly assist our commercial interests, and would be of use in the future should occasion call on us to occupy this country. But if it was not thought advisable to give and build such a bridge, I believe I could, with the assistance of one of my old telegraph staff, now in Ispahan, Mr. McIntyre, build them a suspension bridge, on the lines of a military one, which would not cost very much; all that we should require would be some 340 yards of 3Ainch steel wire rope, together with shackles, blocks, and tackles, &amp;c.; with native workmen and material we could, in a month or so, build thorn such a bridge as would very materially assist them and ourselves, and which, with ordinary care, would last many years.) The Bakhtiaris are ready to give any guarantees for the safety of all mer chandize, &amp;c., passing through their country ; they would build caravanserais, make the roads good wherever necessary, they would put on their own muleteers and mules, against all which they only would require a right to levy a regular tax, as is done in other parts of the country. It would have to be done in order, and a regular contract would have to be drawn out with them covering all these points. Hajji Ali Kuli Khan was going to Tehran in a few weeks to take over charge of the Bakhtiari Horse, and he would take a letter from Isfendiar Khan to the Minister, giving him authority to act in every way in this affair. Thus he would be an accredited agent ot the Bakhtiari Chiefs with the Minister. They then went on to refer to some conversations they had had with Major Sawyer and General Gordon, in which reference had been made to the probability of our having use for them, that we might make a base of their country for military operations in the north, annex the Province of Arabistan, &amp;c. I gave them to understand that I had no knowledge of any such questions, and had no instructions to speak about them. As Hajji Ali Kuli Khan was going to Tehran he could say all that was necessary on the subject to the Minister.3 z. &amp;o Nevertheless, they assured me of their allegiance to our interests, and their hope that we should find use for them in the not far distant future; the word had only to be given, and they would, with their whole tribe, be ready at once to throw themselves into our arms and do anything that was required of them. They were quite strong enough enough to take Ispahan at any moment, and would do so if we only said the word, and would hold it till we were ready to take it. They had no loyalty due to the Kajar family. The Shah only took such money as he could from them, and did nothing in exchange. Between them and the Zil-es-Sultan there was blood, and they owed him a bitter revenge for what he had done in wantonly killing their father, and ever since in sucking their life’s blood. While he had been in any ways acting as Governor over them bis rule was one continual course of oppression, their villages and their own homes had all been ruined by him or by his orders. In the last year, the tax due to the Government, which was 35,000 tomans, i.e., 15,000 for the Bakhtiaris, and 20,000 for Chehar Mahal, he had taken a paper from them for 60,000 tomans, that is to say, 25,000 tomans in excess. It had not been been paid, nor would it be, as the Sadr Azam had pronounced it null and void. They had at the time told him it would be impossible to pay this extra tax, but he insisted, and tried to get them to give over to him their villages in Chehar Mahal. He also asserted, what was a lie, that they had 500,000 tomans stored up, and he wanted some of that. (I can quite credit this, as the Zil-es-Sultan’s rapacity at the present time is beyond bounds. He does anything and everything to acquire land and villages in these districts. I could fill sheets with tales of his oppression and extortion.) _ . They stated that they dreaded the idea, and looked forward with fear to the time when it was possible that the Zil-es-Sultan would again have them in charge. ^ He was at the present time doing all he could to discredit them, causing robberies on the main road by the Zergham-es-Sultaneh’s people, and accusing them of being the culprits; whilst even his own men, the Gholams, who are put as road guards, only lately robbed some Bakhtiaris, who had been to Tehran to sell their sheep, of some 1,700 tomans odd; they had complained to the Zil-es-Sultan, but could not get any redress ; if he once got money into his hands, there was no getting it out again. (This story is true, I heard it before I left for Chichakhor.) Should the Zil-es-Sultan get the Bakhtiari country again, they would have no remedy but to go elsewhere, it would he impossible for them to remain under him. I made out that in case of its being necessary they could bring to the front, some 1,200 men, well mounted and armed. This number is made up of 200 of their own personal attendants, 500 Khaneh Zadeh (house-born), or their own tribesmen, and 500 men consisting of Chiefs of clans and their attendants, these 1,200 men coulu be ready at any spot in a fortnight. Beyond these they could collect a following from the tribes of at least 10,000 men, who would be partially horsemen and partially footmen. Their arms were somewhat heterogeneous. Also, if it were necessary, they could get a large following of Arabs and Lurs who acknowledged their supremacy. Altogether they could be reckoned on for something like 15,000 men. I noticed that although most of the men I saw were armed with Martini rifles of English and Turkish manufacture, yet in some cases the mechanism was out of order an d the guns of very ancient date.

All these Governments had only just been taken over oy the new Governors, and were in a general state of chaos. At Khorremabad some 100 soldiers were starting for a place in Luristan; they were armed with Werndl rifles, but from a conversation I heard between the Deputy Governor and the Colonel it was evident that the ammunition served out to them would not fit the &amp; There was nothing as far as I could see from Shuster to Khorremabad to prevent a good road or even a railway being made. . . .

From Shuster, and therefore from Mohammerah to Sultanabad, this water power was present at recurring points well within the range cf the limits of economic distribution. Thus at Shuster and below is the Karun ; then, at Diztul, the Diz; beyond, the At-i-Zal; between this and Khorremabad the stream at Makhbarabad, the Abisard, the Afrina, the Chames, and Shorab. Then the rivers of Khorremabad and the Diz would be amply sufficient for the distance from Khorremabad to Burujird, thence to Sultanabad there is no lack of water, but at this last place, and thence to Tehran on the one side and Ispahan on the other the motive power would have to be steam, except at Ispahan. Such a scheme T am sure would be taken up in England at a moment’s notice, and I believe that in this case a light electric railway is the only one which would pay until the country was more fully developed. For such development there is ample room, whether it be by the natives or by colonization.

English trade, as far as I can estimate here, is almost daily declining in Persia, and unless some radical measures are taken to stop this decline it will reach a vanishing point.5 'Z-f’r f I do not know if there are any stringent political reasons why the Vice-Consul should he stationed at Mohammerah; as far as I could judge he does not, commercially speaking, appear to be of much use there. I should feel inclined to move him to Shuster or Dizful, where he would find some useful work to do. Another point where a Vice-Consul would be most advantageous is Sultanabad, with powers over Khorremabad and Burujird, even it might he extending to Kermanshah and Hamadan. But he should not he a stay-at-home man, but one who would itinerate, and remain a month or two at a time at the above spots. There is plenty of room for good work at all these places. In conclusion, I am led to believe that there are openings for us in the country, and much good and valuable work is to he done, but that the whole question is in our own hands, and it lies with the Government to say whether these openings shall be utilized and trade pushed. (Signed) J. B. PREECE. Summary. — Roads. It now only remains for me to summarize and submit for consideration such deduc tions and ideas as I have arrived at on this journey as will lead to or assist in arriving at a conclusion whereby these roads can be made suitable to carry British trade, and so induce the trader to utilize them. Between Ispahan and Shuster there are three points on the road which will have to altered before it can be considered a proper caravan one, open to the transit of British mercantile goods. The first is the Pul-i-Amarat. This bridge should certainly be made a permanent and effective one on the higher level, and not open to being carried away, as it is now, by any flooding of the river. Secondly, the Pass of Mawarid, immediately after leaving the above bridge, should be put into better order by means of properly constructed zigzags, and the dangerous hit at the ladder, described in my Report, should be blasted and made thoroughly foot- sure for heavily laden animals ; at the present time it is quite the reverse, although it must be observed that this pass is only used for some six months in the year, the road in summer and autumn being by Rudbar, as followed by Colonel Wells. He, however, describes the drop from the plateau'to the river as being very difficult and dangerous. If this Pass of Marawid was once made good, it is possible that the traffic would always keep to it. Thirdly, the Godar-i-Balutak. Here a bridge, or some more efficient mode of crossing than the present ferry, is imperatively necessary. Mercantile goods of a perishable nature would certainly be liable to damage, as very often the platform of the ferry is awash. The solution, without doubt, is a well-constructed bridge at the point where the Khans are now trying to make a sort of suspension bridge. Hajji Ali Kuli Khan is most anxious to build a bridge if he can possibly do it, as he says this ferry is most dangerous, and annually costs the Bakhtiaris from 50 to 200 lives and some 20,000 tomans’ worth of property. This is doubtless an exaggeration, but, nevertheless, the crossing now is made in a most primitive fashion, and has its dangers. In the long run a bridge of this kind would not only be the cheapest^but would be as effective as any other kind. There are other points of the road where a little clearing away of trees, boulders, and some modification of the gradients would largely add to its efficiency. But, taken on the whole, it is by no means a bad road ; and if only the work indicated at the three points above was carried out, there is no reason why it should not be used for nine months in the year. In winter, during the other three months, this way is blocked; but that is, however, as a rule, only at one point, although in severe winters there are two other places which may be temporarily stopped by snow. The bad point is the Pass of Zirreh, together with the valley of Siligun, between Chichakhor and Kagun. This portion of the road is invariably impassable in winter; the pass would have to be turned, and the Tang-i Darkash-Warkash, to the north-east of Ardal, which carries off the drainage of Chehar Mahal to the Karun, would have to be used. At present it is a very rough road, only fit in winter for foot passengers; but a good and efficient road could be made along it at a small expense, the distance requiring making being only about 4 miles. [1018 6—2] C6 The other points sometimes closed by snow are the Godar-i-Barreh Mordeh and the Shikeft-i-Diz. These, I am told, could easily be opened again without much delay. Neither point is so high as several places on the road from Bushire to Fehran, and it is rarely that this portion of the road is blocked for more than a few days. Use would soon develop it here and at other points, and delays would become merely nominal. To facilitate the use of the road and to render supplies procurable, it would be necessary to build some few caravanserais. At Dopulan, Hilisat, and Pul-i-Amarat they would be absolutely necessary, not only for the above reason, but for shelter for the animals in winter. Shelters would also be necessary at points on the passes of the Barreh Mordeh and about the Shikett-i-Diz. At the other various stages the present occupants of the villages would build for their own profit as soon as they saw the road was being used to any extent. Beyond Mai Amir there is nothing to remark upon. The caravans now being sent by Messrs. Lynch no longer have Shuster as a starting-point, but are dispatched from Ahwaz, going via Ram Hormuz and thence to Kal’ah Tul and Mai Amir, thus obviating the extra trouble entailed in transhipment to the boat for the Upper Karun, &amp;c., with out materially increasing the land carriage. In making any arrangement for the opening of the road from Ispahan across the Bakhtiari country, guarantees would have to be given either by the Bakhtiari Chiefs or the Persian Government that due compensation for robberies would be given as is now done on the Bushire-Tehran road. Against this, and for the expense entailed in making the road practical, permission to charge a road tax would have to be given. From Shuster to Tehran there is but little to be done to make the road a really good one. _ , As I have shown, the bad places have at their worst points been ameliorated, a little clearance of boulders and improvement of the road from the Balarud to the commence ment of the newly-made portion of the Kialan Pass and the last part of the descent to the Takht-i-Chun is all that is necessary, always excepting the restoration of the bridge at Shuster to facilitate caravan traffic, as in times of flood the river there is for some days impassable. . . Caravanserais have been made along the line at such points as are requisite ; all that is now wanted is to place in them caretakers and the necessary supplies. The main deterrent to the use of this road is the robbing Lurs, who hitherto have kept it in a disturbed state. The remedy for this is in the hands of the Central Government. Strong, just, and liberal-minded Governors in Arabistan and Luristan would do all that is needful to this end. Under such conditions there is no reason, that I can see, why this road should not become as much used and as well known as the present one between Bushire and Tehran. Restoration of the telegraph line from Dizful to Khorremabad and a renewal of post-horses would also be effective, but the first consideration is to keep the Lurs in proper subjection. Pilfering there may continually be, that is always going on, even on the main road, but absolute stoppage and looting of caravans, which up to the last few months was practically unknown on the Bushire-Tehran road, should be put a stop to ; then merchants will gain confidence, and will be glad to use the road, especially as now the main one has acquired an unenviable notoriety in that respect, also as owing to a murrain among, the carrying animals in the south of Persia, hire has become very high, and so. put the British quite out of the running in the competition with the Russian merchant in the northern markets. _____ fSianedf J.

I inclose a Memorandum by Nawab Hasan Ali Khan respecting the proposed chausse'e from Astara to Tabreez. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. DURAND. Inclosure in No. 1.

I INQUIRED verbally from His Highness the Sadr-i-Azam regarding the construction of the chausse'e (road) from Astara to Tabreez via Ardebil, and whether a Concession had been given to a Russian Company for this purpose. His Highness said that a Concession had been given to the Eirman'Eirma about three years ago for the construction of a chausse'e (road) from Astara to Ardebil, and that this Concession had been granted exclusively to Persian subjects. Last year, when the Eirman Eirma was here, he requested that his Concession might be made transferable to any foreign subject, but the Shah refused his request. The Valiahd recently informed the Shah that there were some foreign Companies anxious to construct a road from Astara to Tabreez, and asked that a Concession might be granted them. His Majesty replied that he must have time for reflection before he could grant such a Concession. No. 2. Sir M. Durand to the Marquess of Salisbury.—(Received December 23.) (No. 97.) My Lord, Tehran, November 26, 1895. WITH reference to my telegram No. 46 of the 7th November, I have the honour to forward, for your Lordship’s information, a translation of the Concession granted by the Persian Government for the construction of a road between Tehran and Khanikin. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. DURAND. Inclosure in No. 2. Concession for the Construction of a Carriage-road between Tehran and Khanakin, for improving Communication between Tehran and Bagdad, and for establishing a Carriage- transport for Merchandize. (Translation.) [AS this road Avill be constructed merely for pilgrimage to Korbola, it will be called the Zawar, or Pilgrims’ road.] Article 1. The Persian Government will grant this Concession to M. Eelix Morel, [1679 m —1] BFinancial Manager of the German Mining and Machine Companies, for the period of seventy-five years (solar) from the date of the issue of this Concession. Art. 2. The concessionnaire has the right to take into partnership other persons, or to transfer this Concession to such Companies as ma y he created by himself.' Art. 3. The concessionnaire has the right to construct a road between Tehran and Khanakin. He further has the right to construct buildings, such as stations, bridges, and guard-houses, &amp;c., to the extent that he may consider necessary and desirable. Further, lie has the right to appoint a definite time, and establish regulations for the passage of merchandize, travellers, and horsemen. He is, moreover, permitted to charge a toll on animals, muleteers, and travellers. This toll is to be applied to the expenses of constructing and keeping the road in good repair. The rate of this toll must be previously fixed with the sanction of the Persian Government. The tolls shall, however, be fixed at such a rate that the whole income of the enterprise, both from the toll-tax and the gains made on transport, shall pay at least 12 per cent, on the capital. Art. 4. Should the land on the line of the road belong to the Persian Government, it will be given gratuitously as may be required for the construction of the above- mentioned buildings. If the land be owned by private persons, the concessionnaire shall either lease or purchase the land. Art. 5. The road and such buildings as may be constructed in every district, all the implements, machines, and purchased lands will be under the protection of the Persian Government. For the sake of increasing commerce, and for the security of merchandize, and of travellers on the road, the concessionnaire will be entitled to the support of the Persian Government, who will issue strict orders to the Governors and officers of the towns through which the road passes, to render their support and protection to the persons employed on the road, in order that the concessionnaires may carry out their undertaking. The Persian Government will not stint their support in protecting and guarding the road, the buildings, and the employes. Art. 6. The actual works must begin one and a-half year after the issue of this Concession, otherwise the Concession will be considered null and void. Art. 7. After one year from the time the transport service has been established for the conveyance of pilgrims, merchandize, and travellers, the concessionnaire will have to pay every year 15 per cent, on the profits to the Government Treasury, and, in exchange for this, the Government will not demand, under any name or custom, any taxes, tolls, or other duties from the road administration. All the fixed plant and rolling-stock, whether fixed or movable, throughout the whole road will be entirely exempt from taxation. All machinery and carriages required for the road will be exempt from customs duty; but the Customs officials have the right to examine the articles imported, in order that they may not be deceived as to their nature. Art. 8. The concessionnaire is bound to convey Government post at half- cost. He is also bound not to give any preference in the matter of the transport of goods, nor to give special attention or preference to one person over another. He is in this matter to treat people with equality, in order that no one may be vexed. Art. 9. In order to secure the 15 per cent, on the profits mentioned above, the Persian Government has the right to inspect the books of the Company through a special official every six months. Art. 10. As an assurance to the Persian Government that this road will be com pleted without fail, the concessionnaire shall deposit 100,000 marks as a guarantee, in a bank selected by the Persian Government, and shall submit the receipt of the bank to the Persian Government. The sum shall be a guarantee for the completion of the road in four years from the date of the issue of this Concession. No part of this 100,000 marks, deposited as a guarantee, shall be repaid to the concessionnaire until one-fifth of the road is completed; when one-fifth of the sum will be refunded. The remainder of the money shall in like manner be refunded in fifths as the road advances. If the road be not completed in four whole years, whatever sum of the deposit money remains shall belong to the Persian Government. The commencement of the construction of the road mentioned above shall be held io mean the actual commencement of work on the road, and not the preliminary works, such as surveying, drawing up estimates, and map making on the part of the engineers. .Art. 11. On the expiration of seventy-five years, which is the period of this Con cession, should the Concession not be renewed, all the fixed plant, machines, and/ 3 landed property will belong to the Persian Government. If required, the movable property will be purchased by the Persian Government. Art. 12. Should any difficulty arise between the Road Company and the Persian Government, a Committee consisting of three persons must be formed. One person on behalf of the Persian Government, one from the German Legation, and another person chosen by these two. This Committee shall arbitrate decisively for both parties. Art. 13. The Persian Government shall not grant any Concession for the con struction of another carriage road between Tehran and Khanakin to other persons. In case the Government should desire to grant a Concession for the construction of a steam or electric railway between Tehran and Khanakin, preference will be given, with equal rights, to the persons holding the present Concession. Art. 14. The Company must employ Persian subjects for constructing and administering the road, and may only engage such foreigners as are required on account of their experience in the work. The number of these foreigners, both overseers and workmen, should not exceed thirty ; but should thirty persons be insufficient, by special permission of the Persian Government their number may be possibly increased. Art. 15. This Concession in Persian text in two copies will be signed by His Sublime Majesty and exchanged. Jamadi-ul-Awal, 1313 (November 1895). No. 3. Sir M. Durand to the Marquess of Salisbury.—(Received December 23.) (No. 98.) My Lord, Tehran, November 28, 1895. I HAVE the honour to forward to your Lordship herewith a summary of frontier news, from the 14th September to the 26th October. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. DURAND. Inclosure in No. 3. Summary of Frontier News from September 14 to October 26, 1895. Astrabad.—Mr. Consul Churchill reports an unusual state of quiet along the Astrabad frontier, where the Turkomans are kept well in hand by the Governor, Amir Khan Sardar. The Russian port of Kari Kala has been increased from 200 to 700 men, two squadrons of the Turkoman militia now forming part of the garrison. According to information given to Lieutenant-Colonel Picot by General Kuropatkin, the military authorities in Transcaspia are determined on making an example of any parties of Persian Yamuts found raiding across the Atrek, and have increased the garrison accordingly. Meshed.—Some excitement was caused in Meshed during the month of October by the imprisonment of the Nusrat-ul-Mulk, Chief of the Taimuris, and one of the most influential men of the eastern frontier. The Governor-General, the Shabah-ul-Mulk, is said to have been driven to this step by the intrigue and opposition of the Chief, and, acting under orders from Tehran, deported him to one of the stations on the Khorassan Road. The Nusrat-ul- Mulk has always been looked upon as a staunch supporter of the British Government. Her Majesty’s Minister, therefore, interested himself in the case, and has induced His Majesty the Shah to order him to Tehran, where he will have an opportunity of representing his grievances. This action of the Govern or-General will go far towards strengthening his position, and give him an opportunity of instituting much-needed reforms in the internal affairs of the province. The export of grain from Kuchan, Sebsewar, &amp;c., which was becoming a public scandal, has ceased temporarily, owing to the imposition of certain customs duties at the Russian frontier posts. [1679 m—1] ‘ £ 24 Armenian exporters are now holding their stocks in the hopes of a withdrawn of the duties. No steps have yet been taken towards prolonging the Persian system of tele graphs to Bajgirha on the Russian frontier. For the present, at least, the Minister of Posts has no intention of constructing beyond Kuchan. On the Russian side there are no signs of work. Bashire. —An unprovoked and brutal attack was lately made at Ahvvaz by a party of soldiers on certain Englishmen employed by Messrs. Lynch and Co. on the Karun. The embargo on wheat and cereals is still maintained in the Persian Gulf ports. Azerbijan. —Turkish Kurds are reported to have attacked Armenians of the village of Kotur, but were driven back and pursued into Turkey. Troubles having arisen between the Mussulmans and Armenians of Bayazid, 400 families of Christians have fled into Maku. The Persian Government is feeling some uneasiness lest religious feeling against Christians should spread to Persia. Tehran.—The Russian Government has given a guarantee of 5 per cent, on the capital raised for the construction of the Reskt-Kazvin road. The Syndicate have agreed to build a 28-feet road, narrowing to 21 feet on the rocky sections. Two years have been fixed as the limit of time for the construction. A Concession has lately been granted to a German firm for the construction of the Khanikin-Tehran road. The minting of copper at Tehran has at last been put a stop to. The depreciation in Tehran amounts to 12 per cent., and in Shiraz to 25 per cent. (Signed) H. PICOT, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache'. Tehran, November 28, 1895. No. 4. Sir M. Durand to the Marquess of Salisbury.—{Received December 23.) (No. 99.) My Lord, Tehran, November 28, 1895. I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith a Memorandum by Lieutenant-Colonel Picot regarding a conversation with M. Bostelmann, managing engineer in charge of the Resht-Kazvin road, on the subject of details of the work in connection with that road. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. DURAND. Inclosure in No. 4. Lieutenant-Colonel Picot to Sir M. Durand. Sir, Tehran, November 22, 1895. I HAVE the honour to inform you that M. Bostelmann, managing engineer in charge of the Resht-Kazvin road, lately furnished me with some details of the work which he is about to undertake. He stated that his Government had given a guarantee of 5 per cent, on the capital of 2,500,000 roubles raised for the construction. In consideration of this guarantee, the Syndicate had engaged itself to complete the road in two years and to construct a 28-feet way, narrowing to 21 feet only along the rocky sections. M. Bostelmann questioned the possibility of carrying out these conditions on the present capital—the original estimate being framed for a less pretentious road—but added that his Government would in any case see the road through, and extend the guarantee to any fresh outlay of capital. He had received orders to economize in every way, and for the present had decided on commencing work at Peri Bazaar on the Resht side of the lagoon. Later, if the conditions of trade proved favourable, an extension would be made to Enzeli. The alignment would follow the present track as far as Rudbar, and then, with a view to saving the rocky section between that point and Menzil, be carried by a bridge of two spans to the right bank of the Safid Rud. No great difficulty or expense waso 5 anticipated in bridging as the river narrows at Xtudbar, and a rocky outcrop in midstream lends itself naturally to the purpose. Thence the road will follow the old track to Paichenar, and then be taken by the Baikendi or the Kharezan Pass to the southern side of the Elburz. The exact line has not yet been decided on, but M. Bostelmann hopes the experience of this winter will show him the best route. Traffic is to be conducted by means of carts which the Syndicate will place on the road, selling the same on easy terms to private individuals. Mules and camels will work as heretofore. Nothing was mentioned in my inter view of the Meshed-i-Sar-Eirozeh-Tehran road as a possible competitor to the new line, but I gathered that no steps had been taken to buy out the present conces- sionnaire (a Persian) of the former road. M. Bostelmann hesitated to estimate the profits of the Besht-Kazvin road, but mentioned a possible 10 per cent. He did not seem over hopeful of pecuniary benefits. While on the subject of this road, I may further call attention to the traffic between Tehran and Kom, where carts have been working fitfully during the last twelve months, chiefly in the interests of the Persian Postal Department. A contract has now been taken by Messrs. Eischer and Ballogh, the former an Englishman lately employed by the Imperial Road Company, the latter an Austrian and coach builder, who have engaged to conduct a cart service between Tehran and Pasangan, one station beyond Korn, for a period of five years. In two years’ time therefore, provided failure does not attend the efforts of these above-mentioned speculators, we may expect a through passenger and goods service between Resht and Kom, a distance of 260 miles, roughly speaking.

Consul Churchill to the Marquess of Salisbury.—{Received December 23.) { * w o O • J Oita* My Lord, Resht, November 30, 1895. ON my return from my recent visit to Astrabad I found that the Russian Com pany that had obtained a Concession for the construction of a carriage road from Enzelli to Cazveen some years ago had at length commenced operations^ The intention of M. Bostelmann, the chief manager, is to repair the existing road from Peri Bazar to within a few hundred yards of the town of Resht, when the road will deflect to the left and skirt the town. It is to join the existing road a few yards beyond the Chappar Khaneh and the Octroi Station. _ , . The-new road will avoid the antiquated and dilapidated brick bridge which, owing to its steep ascent on one side and its equally steep descent on the other, is both unpleasant and dangerous to cross. _ . Some 700 men are now, I am informed, employed on the construction of this new portion of the road and the repair of the section between Peri Bazar and Resht. The work is not progressing as fast as M. Bostelmann would wish owing to the non-arrival of carts and implements which are daily expected. The delay is due mainly to storms prevailing in this season in the Caspian. The Company promise to dredge the bar at Enzelli, also in the lagoon where it is shallow, and so widen and dredge the Peri Bazar River as to enable steam-launches to ply between Enzelli and Peri Bazar itself. This, it will be seen from my last Com mercial Report, cannot be done at present. (No. 1564, Annual Series.) I will not fail to keep your Lordship informed of the progress of the work.

Summary of Frontier Neivs. Kuchan. —It is reported that, in spite of the embargo, grain is still being exported from Kuchan to Askabad in large quantities, and that prices have risen there in consequence. Pul-i-Khatun. —Thirty Cossacks arrived from Sarakhs on the 19th September and left for Sheikh Juneid on. the following day. All the Cossacks belonging to the Pul-i- Khatun garrison who had gone to Sarakhs have returned. Sarakhs. —Mr. Elias reports that Sartip Mirza Husain Khan, who has been rein stated as Karguzar of Persian Sarakhs, called upon him before leaving to resume his duties. He said that the new canal opened by the Persian Governor for carrying water from the dividing point above Bund-i-Kizilkaya, near Dowletabad, being too shallow and narrow, very little water would reach Persian Sarakhs between the middle of May and middle of February of each year, when all other canals, except the one mentioned, have to be closed according to the Protocol of the late Eusso-Persian Sarakhs Boundary Commission, Thus the Persians will have # to depend chiefly on wells for their water supply, as they will not even receive one-sixth of the water to which they are entitled according to the recent agreement, and the improvement of Persian Sarakhs, to which the Shah seems to attach so much importance, is very doubtful. The greater part of the money intended for the work appears to have been appropriated by the Governor. Samarcand, September 16.—About 200 iron rails, together with a large quantity of telegraph wire, were received by train to-day. September 17.—The work on the Tashkand railway line is progressing, but the line has not yet reached Afrasiab. Meshed. —On the evening of the 30th September the Nusrat-ul-Mulk (the Timuri Chief and Commander-in-chief of Khorassan) was enticed by the Governor-General to the Ark under the pretence of being required to join a conference. The conference appears to have taken place, but on leaving the Govern or-General’s room the Nusrat- ul-Mulk was made prisoner by the Fawashes and other servants of the Ark, was very roughly handled, and robbed of all he had about him. He was then put into his carriage, together with the Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari (one Shahzada Hasan Khan), who had also been arrested, and the two, chained together, were driven oft under a strong guard towards Tehran. The reason given for this sudden arrest of the Nusrat-ul-Mulk is that he and his followers were responsible for several disturbances that have taken place in the town lately, but this is only a pretence. The real reason is that the Nusrat-ul-Mulk, since his return from Tehran, has only partially submitted to the Governor-General’s [1679 e—l]2 V authority, and has allowed it to become known that he thought himself too strong and oo highly placed to be subordinated to the Governor-General. It appears, also° that the latter owes the Nusrat-ul-Mulk a grudge for having ad vised the Shah not to appoint him Governor-General here. It may be mentioned here that, as Governor of the districts adjoining the Herat frontier, the Nusrat-ul-]Vfulk was most useful to this Agency. He was always a friend of the English, and badly disposed towards the Itussians. His fall, therefore, must be regarded as a blow to our interests in Khorassan. (Signed) PEHCY C. WYNHHAM.

I HAVE tlie honour to report my return from an eight days’ tour to the south- south-east of Kerman. The reason for the journey was that his Highness the Earman Earma invited me to visit him at his Mahun garden, which invitation I accepted, as it gave me the opportunity of making the acquaintance of the priestly guardians of the famous shrine, and, at the same time, prevented me from losing touch with himself. After two days spent at Mahun I travelled to Arababad, near which village runs a route to Earn, hitherto unexplored. Three days were spent in mapping the country, after which Mahun was again stopped at, my visit to the shrine having been deferred until the return journey. In Sir E. Gfoldsmid’s “ Eastern Persia ” (vol. i, p. 193), it will be seen that no members of the Mission were allowed to enter the shrine, whereas, in my case, I was invited to enter everywhere without removing my boots. In the main gateway I had a long interview with the assembled priests, who were extremely polite and evidently most anxious to be friendly. Upon my departure, the chief guardian of the shrine thanked me for my visit, and the following morning sent me a present of fruit with complimentary messages, thus ending an entirely amicable meeting with the most influential “ Mollahs ” of the district. In a previous despatch No. 6, I mentioned that the Earman Earma had only just reached Kerman, and that I would defer any report as to his actions until he was settled in the post. He has now been in office for more than two months, during which period our relations could not have been more cordial. It must be remembered that, on two previous occasions, I have been his guest, travelling in Beluchistan with him, during the spring of 1894, for more than two months. I paid my official call the evening of his arrival, which he returned on the third day, thereby offending the chief “ Mollahs,” as, strictly speaking, it is not laid down that the Governor should return the Consul’s call, which places Her Britannic Majesty’s Representative in an utterly false position. Upon the occasion of His Majesty the Shah’s birthday, which occurred a few days later, in proposing my health, the Earman Earma stated that he was devoted to Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, and would forfeit possessions and life to serve it. I have persuaded his Highness to invest money in India, a first instalment of 100,0G0 rupees having been dispatched to Bombay during the past few weeks. In the Mashkhel question, which is connected with the settlement of the Perso- Kharan frontier from Kuh-i-Malik-Siah to Jalk, the Earman Earma has not only shown me the letters of the Shah and Sadr Azam, or Prime Minister, but also has read me his reply, which, upon information supplied by me, proved that Mashkhel at present belongs to neither State, that Her Britannic Majesty’s Government has no aggressive desires, and that, to avoid friction and expense, the question should be settled once for all by a Commission. The Shah’s previous ideas on the subject were extremely fantastic, as he not only believed Mashkhel to be of immense value, but also was convinced that it was owned by Persian subjects. My 1893-94 journey, close to the line in question, has stood me in good stead, as giving me a thorough local knowledge. Added to these palpable proofs of adhesion to Her Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment, I would mention that his Highness sent the Governor of Beluchistan to see me [1588 i—1]2 the day of his departure, telling him to regard anything I might mention as equivalent to an order from himself. To sum up, I have known the Earman Earma for more than two years, and since that date he has steadily become more Anglophile, as previously all his information respecting our rank among the nations was derived from Erench sources, which cannot invariably be described as unbiassed. My Consular position, as may be imagined, is a very easy one, all the Sub-Governors realizing that the slightest misconduct towards British subjects will bring swift retri bution upon them, while the resident Hindus are, at last, able to hold up their heads as their debtors hasten to meet their claims, very few, if any, fresh cases having been brought before me since the Earman Earma’s return. Einally, I would mention that his Highness invariably takes part in my weekly &lt;( Gymkhanas,” that he is studying English daily, and that he proposes to educnte his sons in England. I have, &amp;c.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 41 of the 2lst instant and to your Lordship’s reply, I have the honour to forward to your Lordship herewith a copy of the proposed Concession for the opening out of Enzeli Harbour, with the Shah’s remarks thereon. Before receiving your Lordship’s telegram, I advised the Sadr-i-Azam, who pressed for an answer, not to communicate these remarks to the Russian Minister as they stood, [1588 d—1] B /but to say the Shah would never consent to any scheme involving the grant of land for buildings or the transfer to a Russian Company of the navigation of the Lagoon. His Highness has, I understand, succeeded in staving off the project for the time at least, and if it is pressed, I hope we may succeed in getting rid of its most objectionable features. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. DURAND. Inclosure 1 in No. 2. Project put forward by M. de Butzow to His Majesty the Shah for improving the Harbou of Enzeli. (Translation.) (Secret and Confidential.) ARTICLE 1. In accordance with this Concession, His Majesty the Shah grants to the Enseli-Kazvin Road Company the right of improving the mouth of the port of Enzeli. Art. 2. The works that the Company have to perform are as follows:— 1. The Company must deepen the mouth of the Gulf of Enzeli in such a manner that at no place the depth should be less than 12 feet, in order that ships may easily enter. 2. To construct a breakwater of stone. 3. To construct a lighthouse. 4. To provide necessary apparatus for unloading cargo from ships. 5. To prepare store-houses for storing merchandize. 6. To construct a place to facilitate embarkation. Also, the Company have to construct bridges from the eastern side of the Enzeli Lagoon to the point where it joins the Enzeli-Kazvin “ chaussee ” road, in order to give passage to water, fish, and boats. Art. 3. The Company must always have machines for dredging and other works, in order that the depth of the place should always be kept up. Art. 4. The Company have the right to anchor buoys on both sides of the passage for ships, and the authorities must prevent the destruction of these buoys. Art. o. The Company will put into force Regulations for the safety and advantage of the passage from the anchorage. These Regulations must necessarily be accepted by all the ships. * J Art. 6. The Company, after completing the works of the harbour, will charge certain harbour dues from the ships for the right of passing up and for the advantages which they enjoy. But the amount of these dues will be fixed by a Commission consisting of Persian officials, the Russian Legation, and the agents of the Company. However, the amount of charges will not exceed 10 per cent, per annum on the expenditure. The ships which do not enter this harbour are, of course, exempt from such dues except from lighthouse dues. 5 T he Company have the right to charge dues for ninety-nine years, on condition that all the buildings, &amp;c., for this work remain in good repair, as built at the beginning, and that, after the expiration of the above-mentioned period, all the works belong exclusivelv to the Persian Government. Art. 7. Boats belonging to the residents of the neighbourhood of Enzeli are free from the payment of dues in passing through this course, but they must not violate the Regulations. Art. 8. The Persian Government shall not demand customs duty on machines and other necessary apparatus which are imported for the purpose of improving the Enzeli Harbour. The Company is also to be exempted from the payment of customs duty and road tolls on machines and other necessary implements which may be brought from any other parts of Persia. J r&lt; ir Al f -£• A suitable piece of land shall be granted to the Company on the shore of the Lrult ot Rnzeli, Ben Bazaar, or any other place connected with the Enzeli-Kazvin chaussee road, for storage of merchandize, of materials and apparatus, for erecting a brick-kiln, houses for staff and labourers, and a work-house for repairing implements.Art. 10. The Company shall select, according to their wish, places for providing stone, pebbles, &amp;c., which are required for the buildings on the shore of the gulf. The use of such places shall be granted gratuitously to the Company. Art. 11. The Company has the right to possess special steam-launches and boats for conveying passengers and cargo on the Gulf of Enzeli. September 8, 1895. Inclosure 2 in No. 2. The Shah's Remarks on some of the Articles of the preceding Project. (Translation.) (Secret and Confidential.) IN the first place, with regard to the breakwater, that they are to construct of stone; its length and breadth must be explained. Secondly, the tower that they wish to build, which is called “ phart ” by Europeans, has already been constructed by the Persian Government. Should that tower be ineffective it may be improved. If it cannot be improved, or if its place is to be changed, the Persian Government will themselves, on the plan of the engineers, build it, in which case the Persian Government have to charge lighthouse dues. Fourthly (paragraph 4, Article 2). It must be explained in detail what is the neces sary apparatus for unloading cargo from the ships. Fifthly (paragraph 5, Article 2). “To prepare store-houses for storing merchandize.” Provision on this question has been made in the Commercial Treaty. What need is there of mentioning it in this ? Sixthly (paragraph 6, Article 2). With regard to a place for embarking. It must be clearly explained how they wish to build it, and it must be limited, and the limits clearly known. A vague question cannot be sanctioned. Also with regard to the wording of “ to construct bridges from the eastern side of the Enzeli Lagoon to the point where it joins the Enzeli-Kazvin “ chaussee ” road in order to give passage to water, fish, and boats.” This cannot be understood. What is the meaning of arched bridges for water and fish. The intention is not clear. With regard to the 4th Article. The Regulations must be put forward independently of this project. They will be sanctioned if it is not injurious to consent to them. With reference to the 6th Article which they have inserted regarding the rights of charging lighthouse dues. This charge is the right of the Persian Government, who will also construct the lighthouse. The period of the Concession is to be seventy-five years. Regarding the Customs, it should be inserted in Article 8, that the Customs officials should have the right to examine the things that nothing else should be imported except machines and apparatus. With regard to the 9th Article, the place they ask for has no relative connection with the work of dredging. It appertains to the construction of the road. What ought to have been written in the Turkmanchai Treaty is written, and also what bad to be inserted in the road Concession is written. Whatever refers to the works of dredging should be written in this. It must be made clear what is the intention of writing this Article. With regard to the 10th Article. It should be made clear what sort of a building they want to construct. If the building is for their own residence, in accordance with the Treaty they have either to hire or purchase as many buildings as are necessary. AY hat is the use of constructing a house about which they write. With regard to the 11th Article. There are as many steam-launches and boats as are required on the Enzeli Lagoon belonging to Beglar Begi and the natives of Enzeli; nevertheless, should these be insufficient, the Persian Government will purchase some from the Russian Government for work in order that the Company may not suffer on account of their deficiency.4 No. 3. Sir M. Durand to the Marquess of Salisbury.—[Received October 21.) (No. 80. Confidential.) My Lord, Gulhek, September 27, 1895. I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith a summary of frontier news received during the month of September. 1 have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. DURAND. Inclosure in No. 3. Summary of Frontier News. (Confidential.) Meshed. — On the arrival of the new Governor - General of Khorassan some correspondence took place between the Afghan Agent, Abdullah Khan, and the Karguzar. Abdullah Khan tried to persuade the Karguzar to present him to the Governor-General, but he refused to have any official dealings with him, and suggested his paying his visit in a private capacity. The Governor of Herat has not relaxed his efforts to get Abdullah Khan recognized as Afghan Agent at Meshed. It is reported that the Russians are urging the Persian postal authorities to open a Post Office at Persian Bujgirha, and to establish a postal and carriage service for the conveyance of mails and passengers between Askabad and Meshed. The passport officer continues to levy passport fees from Afghans arriving in Meshed. Colonel Picot on his journey to Meshed saw the Bujnurd Chief, the Sabam-i- Dowleh, who was starting shortly on a tour to the Goklam territory. The Chief’s journey is reported to be for purely pacific purposes, and the condition of the frontier to be quite quiet. Colonel Picot also reports that the crops from Veramine to Meshed are excellent, and that the supplies are plentiful; but in spite of the Shah’s prohibition the Russian Armenians are exporting corn to a large extent, and should this continue, insufficient store for the year’s consumption will be brought to Meshed. All reports from the frontier point to the fact that the Provincial Government is bankrupt. Kerman .—The postal service recently established between Meshed and Kerman via Tabaz and Yezd has been discontinued. A post had been waylaid, and the bag made away with, as also the camel rider who was with it. The route was found too dangerous, as well as too expensive. Herat .—The Herat Agent states that there is no truth in the report that the Afghans are building a fort at Chakhausur and populating Taraku, or that they intend to reopen the old Taraku Canal. Mohammerah .—An officer has arrived at Nassery, specially sent by the Nizam-es- Sultaneh, to enforce the embargo on grain. The Mues-es-Sultaneh has also received orders from the Nizam-es-Sultaneh to enforce the embargo strictly. The Persian Post Office is open at Mohammerah, and a regular service with Shuster has been organized. Busreh .—Two or three boats of Karun wheat have lately gone to Busreh in spite of the embargo.

I HAVE the honour to inform your Lordship that a few days ago the Shah sent for me and told me, confidentially, that M. de Butzow had lately put forward a proposition for deepening the harbour of Enzeli, and opening it up for trade. The Shah promised to send me a copy of the scheme when he received it, and he requested me to give my careful consideration to the conditions, and to let him know if I thought any of them dacgerous or injurious. The Shah has now sent me a copy of the proposals. A Concession for ninety-nine years for dredging the harbour is to be granted to a Russian Company. The Conces sion provides for the construction of a lighthouse and a breakwater by the Company, and for the navigation ot the lagoons. Power of raising harbour dues is to he vested in the Company, and a grant for the erection of warehouses and other buildings is to he made to them. The Shah has proposed several alterations. If these were agreed to and observed, the length of the Concession would he shortened to seventy-five years, the Company would be only allowed to hire or buy buildings which are already standing, and Persians would have control of the navigation. Rut these conditions would not he observed, and though, when taken in connection with the Resht-Kasvin Road scheme, the project offeis considerable commercial advantages, yet it would finally reduce Enzeli to a Russian port, and must intensify the feelirg of Russian neighbourhood, which already weighs heavily on the Shah and his Ministers. 1 cannot suggest limitations to the scheme which would remove these dangers. The Russian Minister starts for Europe next week, and is anxious to obtain an immediate answer from the Shah. It would probably be possible to induce His Majesty to postpone his consent till the subject has been fully considered. Should I press the above considerations upon him ?[This Document is the Property of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government.] NO. 7. PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY. ASIA. [September 23.] CONFIDENTIAL. 2404 No. 1. Consul Sykes to the Marquess of Salisbury.—(Received September 23.) (No. 6.) My Lord, . Kerman, July 20, 1895. I HAVE the honour to report my return from a journey to the south of Kerman. The object I had in view was fourfold : to explore and survey the large tracts of country shown blank on the map, to accept two invitations given by Persian noblemen, to increase my knowledge of the nomad population, and, finally, to try and trace the route by which the famous traveller, Marco Polo, journeyed from Kerman to Jiruft. During my tour I accomplished a distance of over 200 miles, some 80 per cent, being previously unexplored. I was, furthermore, enabled to renew acquaintance with two friends made on former journeys—Mahomed Khan, a nomad Chief, and Pustum Khan, the Governor of Rahbur, at which latter place my presence also insured the settlement of more than one debt due to British Indian subjects. In addition, by visiting Sardu, I travelled through the summer quarters of the Mehnis, who are nomadic tribesmen, and was enabled to effect my purpose with regard to Marco Polo. My route lay through Jupa, Kariat-el-Arab, to Lalazar, which range I exhaustively explored, scaling the Kuh-i-Shah, the height of which was computed to be 13,700 feet. Continuing south, Rahbur was the next village of importance. From this halting-place, the route lay a little to the south of east through Sardu to the Dilfard Pass, which is some 20 miles from the “ Camadi ” of the illustrious Marco, which ruined site was visited during my third journey. In order to “ connect,” as far as possible, the Dilfard range was climbed with excellent results. This was the most southerly point reached, as, hearing that the new Governor—the Farman Farma—was due to reach the city in less than a week, I returned home by forced marches, passing through Rayin, from which little town I followed a route falling to the west of that shown on the map, where the evidence of ruined caravanserais, coupled with Marco Polo’s description, points to its being the very route used by him. The whole of the uplands visited, and especially Sardu, are extremely fertile, growing- wheat for most of the lower villages of the district, where nothing but barley appears to be cultivated. The climate is superb, the great plain averaging 7,000 feet to 9,000 feet. It is naturally well watered, and, were science brought into the field, the whole country would become a huge granary. The inhabitants are entirely nomads, mostly of the Mehni tribe, but with a good sprinkling of Beluchis. They migrate to Jiruft for the winter, where some of them recollected having seen me in 1894. Their sole industry is carpet weaving, but, unfortunately, the introduction of European patterns has greatly lessened the value of their products from an artistic point of view. To conclude, the harvest is everywhere spoken of as a “ bumper ” crop, the late frosts having almost entirely destroyed the young locusts, so that their ravages have been insignificant. Added to this, the rain has fallen opportunely both for the upland, lowland, and hot country cultivators. Everywhere I was treated with the greatest cordiality as Her Britannic Majesty’s Representative, constant communication with India having accentuated the contrast between Persian misgovernment and the British Raj. Upon returning to Kerman I sent out my Secretary to meet the Farman Farma, calling upon him the day of his arrival. —2] B2 He received me as an old friend, and in every way showed his pleasure at my appointment. ,, ,, , . , It is loo soon to form an opinion upon the results that may ensue from his letum.

My Lord Gulhek, August 26, 1895. WITH reference to Sir F. Lascelles’ despatch No. 91 of the 30th May, 1893, I have the honour to report that the term of the Concession for the Resht-Kazvin carriage road has been extended for a further period of two and a-half years, and there seems to be a probability that this road may before long be set in hand. General Kouropatkine seemed interested in the project, and it is not unlikely that the extension of the Concession is due to him. . TJ . . I submit a copy of the additional Agreement which has been signed. It is m some respects slightly less favourable to the concessionnaires than the original, but it empowers them to levy inordinately high tolls, and this will, I think, be the cause of trouble in future. I hear that the Russians are also in hopes of obtaining before long a Concession for the navigation of Lake Urumiah. This is a matter of some importance. I do not think there are any sufficient grounds for objection on our part, but the Concession may have an unfavourable effect on our Trebizond trade. M. Poliakoff, the main concessionnaire in the Resht-Kazvin road project, has now taken over the administration of the affairs of the Tehran Rail and Tramways Company, and the head-quarters of the Company will henceforth be at Moscow.

In the 3rd paragraph of the 1st Article it is agreed that the road shall be in the exclusive possession of the Company and its partners for seventy-five years to 1970. 2. In Article 2 it is agreed that during the seventy-five years, he., to 1970, the Persian Government will not in any way whatever, and under any name or custom, demand taxation from the above-mentioned Company. 3.

Inclosure 2 in No. 3. Memorandum, by Lieutenant-Colonel Picot respecting Russian Enterprise in Northern Persia. THE renewal of the Concession for the Resht-Kazvin road, and the formation of a Company by M. Lazare Poliakoff, with a capital of 2,500,000 roubles, 1,000,000 of which has already been paid up, seem to indicate the commencement of active work. The promoters of the Company are apparently sanguine of the success of their enterprize, but I find it difficult to conceive how a road loaded with a debt of nearly 250,000/. can be made to pay its way. , The high rates of toll which they propose levying will also not improbably defeat the purpose of the concessionnaires by driving the traffic to other routes, such for instance as the Meshed-i-Sir, Firozekoh-Tehran road, which remains practically open all the year round, and is by no means difficult for native transport. 2. In my letter, dated the 3rd September, 1894, I called attention to the financial interest of M. Poliakoff in the affairs of the Rail and Tramway Company of Tehran, and mentioned the possibility of his acquiring a preponderating influence in the management. . , . . , . Information has lately been received of the transfer of the Administration from Brussels to Moscow, whence direct control will be exercised in future. 4 he business still remains under Belgian protection in Tehran, but as the Legation seems anxious to wash its hands of the Company, a transference to the Russian Legation is not improbable. ^ Messrs.

I HAVE the honour to report at length on the occurrences to which 1 have alluded in my recent telegrams to your Excellency, Nos. 17, 18, and 19. As your Excellency will have observed, we are having serious troubles in Tabriz, which have been preparing for some time past, owing to the apathy of the native authorities who have for months seemingly given up interesting themselves in the pressing needs of a large population, or even in the general welfare—an attitude which eventually led to my putting the matter before your Excellency on the 2nd of last May. Half of the population of Tabriz being actually reduced to starvation, it has at last determined to call attention to its wants by forcible means On the day of the Valiahd’s return to Tabriz from Tehran, a slight demonstration was made by the poorer classes in the bazaars, but was at once quieted by promises made by the Kaimakam on the Valiahd’s part. (Note.—On Monday the 29th July a number of women went to the Kaimakam to expose their necessities, and they then threatened the present riots in the event of their complaints being ignored.) Tired of vain promises, and pushed by need, the women of Tabriz came to the fore last Saturday. At 3 A.M. a few calls along the streets emptied some hundred of Anderoons, a mob was collected, and a march was made to the Kaimakam’s residence, which they found surrounded and defended by about 100 cavalrymen and by his own followers. An assault was made by the wmmen and some lower class men against the entrances, hut was met by a discharge of fire-arms. Five men were killed immediately before the said residence, and three others on a bridge in the vicinity. Seeing that it could not make an impression upon the military, part of the mob turned its attention to the bazaar which it paraded, obliging all traders to close their shops, and looting all the bakeries of their contents, whether in kind or cash, whilst the remainder made a demonstration against the Valiahd’s town Palace. Here they also encountered military, and were repulsed with the loss of two lives. They then rushed through the bazaars in the vicinity of the Christian quarters where they eventually separated, some taking refuge at a mosque, and others at the Hussian Consulate-General, carrying two of their dead bodies with them. Here they declared their intention of staying, until the Russian Consul-General should come in from the country and extend to them Russian protection, as they stated they were utterly sick and tired of the corruption and misgovernment of their own officials, and were ready to accept any foreign protection. On Prince Dabija, the Acting Russian Consul-General, coming in late in the evening, and on his promising to see the Valiahd and arrange about the rate of the first necessities of life being reduced to reasonable prices, matters were quieted down temporarily. Prince Dabija having obtained the Valiahd’s word of honour to bring an immediate remedy to matters, left again for the country. (Note.—The Valiahd, on learning that Prince Drdbija was coming to town, sent an officer to beg of him not to risk himself among the “savages.” His Imperial Highness did not show the same solicitude in my case, although he knew that I w 7 as at the time staying at the Russian summer residence. His Imperial Highness likewise begged Dabija, after the interview, to return at once to the country.) On Sunday morning, 4th instant, the mob of women finding that nothing had been gained by their previous action (the wrecked bakeries being unable to provide bread except of a vile quality and at a high price) again collected together, and, reinforced by great numbers of all classes, made for the Kaimakam’s residence, crying out that they would not rest until they had made aw T ay with this functionary and all his relatives, who occupy the most important posts around the Valiahd. This time, finding the place undefended (the Valiahd despairing evidently of resisting the wishes of the people, had ordered that the military should be hidden in a neighbouring mosque), they broke through the main entrance, sacked the house of what had been left in it, and destroyed the garden around it. After thus venting their fury they proceeded to the Nizam-el-Ulema’s residence, where they were received with a fire which killed a woman and a man, and wounded many other people. In the meantime someSeyeds, in company with the son of the Mushtehid, obtained an interview with the Valiahd, who gave them a paper signed by him promising a speedy [1536 n —2] ^ C6 remedy to the ills complained of (hfote.—Bread 12 shehis a batman, mutton at 2 krans 16 sbahis a batman), and also fixing the amount of blood-money be was willing to give to the relatives of such people as had been shot down. (Note.—200 tomans per bead.) At about 3 o’clock in the afternoon it was rumoured that the Ka'iniakam had placed his resignation in the Valiahd’s hands. Previously to this, His Imperial Highness had dismissed his son-in-law, Lotf Ali Khan, from his functions of Beglar Begy, replacing him by the Nusret Essultana. (Note.—The Beglar Begy’s farash. bashi, Naib Kerim, a notorious blackguard, whom the mob accused of many of their ills, has been imprisoned. Yesterday the Kargusar told me he thought this man ought to have been shot out of hand, but I suggested that he should be previously given a trial, as many of his superiors were as guilty as he.) There seems to be little hope of much good coming from the Valiahd’s promises, and disorders may still be expected. So far the mob has behaved exceedingly well to all foreign and Christian inhabi tants, but there is no saying how long they will maintain their attitude, as bad characters are coming in from the neighbourhood, who cannot fail to stir up all evil feelings in order to profit in the general confusion. Had not General Wagner been here, matters might have gone to any extremes (Note.—General Wagner came into town on Friday with what companies he had at his disposal under canvas. He is at present in the principal barracks, which he cannot leave without fear of wholesale desertion on the part of his unpaid and uncared-for soldiery), for the few regiments we possess, having the utmost contempt and hatred of their native officers, whose sole endeavours, the men say openly, are alone directed to robbing them of their miserable pay, will only obey his orders. Such has been and is the state of affairs here that I and my colleagues have deter mined to write a collective letter to the Valiahd on the gravity of the situation, and the measures most likely to allay the existing excitement, a copy of which I hope I shall be able to forward to your Excellency by next post. In conclusion, I may state that the Shereef-ed-Dowleh called upon us separately yesterday, and we have reason to believe that the language which I, my Turkish and French colleagues held on the occasion, must have urged the Valiahd to bring about and accept the resignation of the Kaimakam.

Inclosure 2 in No. 4. Consul-General Wood to Sir M. Durand. Sir, Tabriz, August 8, 1895. IN continuation of my despatch of the 5th instant, with regard to the riots which have taken place here, I have now the honour to forward to your Excellency a copy of the collective letter (in French and Persian) which I, my French and Turkish colleagues, thought it our duty to address to the Valiahd. Prince Dabija, the Acting Russian Consul-General, excused himself from joining us on the ground of our not having addressed the said letter in the proper form, and of our alluding to the state of the roads. As the manner of address which Prince Dabija favoured was that used in general by native petitioners presenting an humble Petition to their Rulers, and opposed, therefore, to our idea of what is due to our character of foreign Representatives, we had nothing left but to act without his co-operation, the necessities of the situation not admitting of any delay. The spirit of the Nizam-el-Ulema’s faction, of which the Kaimakam, the Vakil-el- Mulk, and the Dabir Essultaneh were the principal representatives around the Valiahd, seems to have been broken by the determined attitude of the populace against its members, for the Kaimakam has taken refuge in the Prince’s town residence, and the latter have left town for their villages some 20 or -30 miles away.8 pains, exposes a la devanture des boulangeries, en vous cachant le fait qu’ils les ont envojds eux-memes avant votre passage.

Consul-General Wood to Sir M* Durand. Sir, Tabriz, August 12, 1895. WITH reference to my despatch of the 8th August, I have the honour to give your Excellency the latest information which has come to hand re the recent riots here, and the measures taken to accede to the just demands of the populace for the necessaries of life at a fair price. It would seem that the Valiahd had a meeting yesterday of the principal functionaries of his Court, where it was arranged that each of those present should contribute a certain sum of money in order to buy wheat at the market price and retail it at 12 shahis, the price to which it had been lowered on the riots taking place, to the different bakeries in town until the arrival on the markets of Government and other cereals some forty days hence. The above contributions amounting to 18,000 tomans are divided as follows :— Tomans. His Imperial Highness .. .. .. .. .. .. 7,000 Members of his Court .. .. .. .. 10.000 The Mushtehid .. .. .. .. .. .. 1,000 The Nasseret-es-Sultaneh, who has replaced the Beglar Begy, has been intrusted with the carrying out of the arrangement. This way of endeavouring to turn the difficulty proves that the Valiahd has not had the courage to oblige his wealthy courtiers to open their stores where thousands of khalvars are simply rotting away. So incensed are the merchants at these proceedings that they have deliberately refrained from coming forward to the help of the authorities in their difficulties, and I must say, knowing how disgracefully the people’s requirements in general have been treated for months past, I cannot blame them for their attitude. I take the liberty of inclosing a sample of wheat taken haphazard from a native store which will show how far possessors of this prime article are willing to keep it whilst awaiting the opportunity to sell at famine prices. It is currently stated that the Kaimakam is to be reinstated, notwithstanding the evident and just objections of the population. Many Proclamations against the Kaimakam and his partisans or relatives are daily placarded in the bazaars, and I feel certain from all I can gather, that if the Government seeks to impose the former upon the people there will be fresh disorders, but this time of a graver nature, as many of the male population are now armed, and will be aided and abetted by outside “lootis,” who are already proving their presence by assaults and robberies at night. We are relying on your Excellency’s influence with the Shah to prevent disturbances which may have the most serious consequences for us, for the Valiahd has lost the9 confidence and good-will of the people owing to his weakness, and the few troops at present at his disposal would sooner join the rioters than oppose them. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL Gr. WOOD. P.S.—~So far J beg to inform that we have no acknowledgment of our collective letter. C. Gr. W. Inclosure 5 in Ho. 4. Consul-General Wood to Sir M. Durand. Sir, Tabriz, August 19, 1895. WITH reference to my despatches on the subject of the recent disturbances at Tabriz, I have the honour to report that a certain amount of uneasiness still prevails in town owing to the continued bad quality and light weight of the bread, and also to the sympathetic attitude preserved by the Valiahd towards the late Kaimakam and his party. I hear to-day that the Valeil-el-Mulk and the Dabir-es-Sultaneh have been induced by the Yaliahd to come back from their villages to which they retired after the second outbreak of popular feeling, and that His Imperial Highness went so far as to express his regret at the way he had treated them on that occasion. The Beglar Begy, who had suffered the most, as the Yaliahd is said to have broken his cane on his back, abandoning his wife and family in Tabriz, has continued his flight, and is now on his way to Khorassan vifi Askabad, provided with a Russian visa to his passport, on the 15th instant. The Yaliahd is said to have taken upon himself the cost of the repairs to the Kaimakam’s residence. He has induced this personage to return to it, and has already paid him a formal visit there. From current report it is said that the Yaliahd has been advised to call to Tabriz a certain Hadgee Mirza Kiassim, Vehil or Prefect of Dekhargan (neighbouring parts of Tabriz), and a strong partisan of the Kaimakam faction, and give him the Governor- Generalship of Tabriz on the excuse that such an appointment, being apparently a change, would appease the people. These, however, will not be taken in by such a flimsy proceeding. The day before yesterday a crowd of women paraded the bazaars asking to be informed as to what had become of the blood-money which had been promised to the relatives of the victims of the riots. Their proceedings induced the Yaliahd to order the payment of 750 tomans on that account, but as tw T elve people were killed during the riots this amount is still some 2,250 tomans short. With regard to the various quantities of grain which I had stated as being stored and kept back for their own purposes by certain officials of the Yaliahd’s Court, the accompanying list will show the names of the different detentors and the quantities currently known to be at present in their possession in town. In conclusion, I beg to state that I feel convinced that we are not yet at the end of our troubles, for the people will only be satisfied by the appointment of a perfectly new man as Governor-General, and the production of a better quality of bread for the present price. It is fully time that the superior native authorities should awaken to the responsibilities they are incurring by their procrastination in bringing a remedy to the woeful state of things in this part of the Empire. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL G. WOOD. Summary of Inclosure. Mr. Wood enumerates the principal store-holders in the Yaliahd’s circle, amongst the clergy class and merchants, and estimates the least quantities they at present possess in their town stores at 73,700 khalvars.10 o Xnclosure 6 in No. 4.

Meshed. It is reported from Pul-i-Khatun the Russians are constructing a cart- road between Sarakhs and Sheikh Junaid, via Garmab, Agar Chashma, Chakmakli, and south of Kayun. About 100 families of Seistan settlers deserted Daulatabad on the 5th July, taking refuge in Russian Sarakhs. Correspondence is now taking place with a view to the recall of these families. A telegraph line is in course of construction between Askabad and the Persian frontier at Bajgirha. It is proposed to connect with the Persian line by an extension from Kuchan to the frontier. The effect of this line will be to divert a great part of the Khorassan traffic from the Tehran-Tabriz-Tiflis line to that of Trans-Caspia. Much of the telegraphic traffic from Tehran to Russia will also be taken over the Russian line in preference to the English. Tabriz .—Her Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports the occurrence of a serious riot on the 3rd August, when the mob attacked the house of the Kaim-Makam (the chief official of the province). The house was defended, five of the rioters being killed. Failing in this attempt a demonstration was made against the Palace of the Vali Ahd and two men were killed. During the disturbances the bazaars were rushed and many shops looted. On the 4th August a second assault was directed against the Kaim-Makam, his residence being partially destroyed. On this day one man and one woman were killed. Order was restored through the intervention of the Russian Consul-General, to whom the people appealed. The Kaim-Makam was removed from office, and the Vali Ahd made promises as regards the cheapening of food supplies. The riots were entirely directed against the official classes, and the behaviour of the crowd towards all foreign and Christian inhabitants was exceedingly good. Shiraz .—Great scarcity prevails.

My Lord, Batoum, August 20, 1895. ACCOEDIIS G to the newspaper “ Novoe Obozrenie” of the 6th (18th) instant, the Trans-Caucasian Section of the Administration of Ways and Communications has decided to construct a macadamized road from Astara, a seaport town on the Caspian Sea, through Ardahil to Tabriz. It would appear that the principal reasons, in addition to local considerations, which induced the engineers of that Administration to select the above-mentioned route, in preference to the alternative Lenkoran-Ardabil-Tabriz road, were that the distance between the terminal points was two-thirds less, besides which the cost of construction will be reduced by 1,000,000 roubles. This road will pass almost exclusively through Persian territory, and is to run at some considerable distance inland parallel to the frontier. It is likewise proposed to build a branch road along the coast of the Caspian Sea, between Astara and the Island of Sara, near Lenkoran, in order that vessels desirous of effecting landing operations may take advantage of the spacious accommodation, and, comparatively speaking, safe anchorage afforded to shipping in the waters lying between the mainland and this island.
