Dated the 17th January, 19^0 To The deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, b u B h i r E • memorandum I beg to forward herewith the attached three letters, n A' from myself to Shaikh Isa regarding the con vening of the Majlis al Urfi, and 'C n from Shaikh Isa to myself in answer to W A', also some notes on a convers ation I had on the subject with Shaikh Abdullah. j&gt; , (' )., If you recollect, I consulted you on the sub- Lt/O a £ jea't^when you were last here, and my letter 'A' was writ ten more or lees on the lines you suggested it should take. Actually the Majlis came to a bad end just before Captain Bray,M»C. went home with Shaikh Abdullah, it appears that Shaikh Isa dismissed a prominent member^ without consulting * the Political Agent. As this was contrary to the clause on the appointment etc. of Majlis al Orfl as laid down In Order In Council'' Captain Bray.M.C. took objection and refused to recognise the existing Majlis until Shaikh Isa gave an explanation of his action. This Shaikh Isa never did, and the iviajlls disolved of itself. Captain Brav^M.G.j I understand would have taken the matter further, had he not suddenly left Bahrain. (3) My letter 'A' as you will see, is an endeavour to get the Kajlis going again. Shaikh Isa evades the point and brings up the subject of Shaikh Abdullah's visit to London and his petition to Sir Hertzel. He further Bay. that he is sending his son Abdullah to talk to me about the matter.(s) » (4) The day following that on which Shaikh Isa wrote his letter n B w Shaikh Abdullah and I had a four hours con versation which covered a wide range of subjects. I will endeavour to give a short precis of what took place, as it will better convey the situation to you as I see it here. The talk was quite friendly and carried on without the slightest show of restraint. I may state for a start that I have of course not divulged to Shaik^ Isa the fact that I knew of his petition in London sometime back. (a) B'ipstly, Abdullah stated his father had not given an answer about the Majlis al Urfi as he was anxious to get an answer to his proposal 11 as put forward in London. I answered that Shaikh Isa need not allow the delay to Govt's reply to effect the immediate appointment of the Majlis as ordered under Para^(W^&lt;) Order in Council. I emphasised that until an answer came from His Majesty's Government, Shaikh Isa was expected to abide by existing orders. Later on, if a change was approved of the necessary alteration in the appointment of the Majlis could easily be made. Abdullah saw my point and promised to get Shaikh Isa to appoint the Majlis atonce. (This at the time of writing has . • , ■ - not taken place) (b)/W/Abdullah asked me boldly m^t opinion on Shaikh Isa f s letter to Sir Arthur Hertzel and especially my ideas on the four proposals put up. He stated Shaikh Isa was anxious for an answer from Government, yet at the same time was nervous as to the nature of the reply he would get^ He feared Government might be angry. The actual proposals did not matter much so long as His Majesty's Governmet were not annoyed with him. I asked Abdullah if he wanted my opinion as a friend or as Political Officer. He hastened to say as a friend'. I told him I thought the letter to Sir Arthur ft-' Hertzel had much better A never been written, it was an un wise document and raised certain awkward questions, the(3) answering of which might only result in a rebuff to Shaikh Isa- (c) Re^ardin^; proposal 1 . I said things had been working satisfactorily up-to-date* It was a mistake to get a defi nite ruling from Government. The proposal would certainly bring forth a ruling in the matter. Shaikh Isa^ proposal actually meant that he wished to have jurisdiction over the subjects of the Chiefs of Nejd, Koweit, Oman, Zanzibar, Hadramaut, Yeman, Hejaz, when they were in Bahrain. Govern ment could never agree to this and might possibly turn roundp and grant him no rights whatsoever over foreign Arab subjects Here Abdullah hastened to inform me that Shaikh Isa refer red only to the inhabitants of Hassa, Qatif and Qatar proper' not further afield. I pointed out that bp unofficial arranger© nt he was already allowed control over the people of these places, therefore why raise the quefetion at all. Abdullah had nothing to say to this but shake his head. The net result of my talk over proposal 1 showed me that Shaikh Isa would be quite satisfied if he definitely were given control of the inhabitants of Qatif, Qatar and Hasea (not Nejd) who visited Bahrain. I personally see no great harm in conceeding this much, but I consider it would be greatest mistake in the world to put the subjects of Koweit, Oman, Hadarmaut, yeman, Hejaz, Zanzibar etc. under hie control. We should only lay up for ourselves much trouble with the rulers themselves and theWj&amp;ubjects, the latter even now most vigorously insist that they come under the protection of the British Agency. Definite orders on the subject I think should be given Shaikh Isa early. (d) Regarding proposalll . I pointed out the sole object of the authorities who drew up the 'Order in Council' was that the foreign element should be fairly represented on the Majlis al Urfi. That the -^ajlis al Urfi was intended to try Mercantile Oases chiefly, of which the majority con cerned foreign merchants, that we should only get overwhelm ed by appeals from the Indian Foreign Community, should a(4) purely Bahrain Majlis sit. In fact, it would be impossible to send Indians and Persians to such Majlis, they would straight away refuse to go there. I think Shaikh Abdullah saw my point. He appeared in the end to be quite willing to let things remain as at present and as regulated by 'Order in Council'. He appeared to dread such a thing as an appeal of an Indian MerchanCto India against the deci sion of hie father^ Bahrain Majlis. I suggested this as a possible contingency* (©) Regarding proposal 111 . 'ZUBARAH', I pointed out the unlikelihood of His Majesty's Government**/ ever, even Abdullah considering such a question. I showed stajajs® how such a course would atonce result in trouble with the ruler of tiatar and Nejd, and would not only be looked upon as a piece of great injustice by those two rulers, but would be most vigorously opposed on the score of justice, treaty and trade. To my surprise Abdullah admitted the entire force of my remarks, and then calmly turned round and said ' 'Ve dcjnot really want ZUBARAH so very much, but we do want to statTe our claim on the mainland, and get a port there in order that should Bin Saud open a port at A1 Jubaij (north of Qatif) we may not be entirely ruined!! He further explain ed that Shaikh was very nervous on this point and feared th t Bin Saud had something of this sort in mind for A1 Jubail was an ideal place for a port, there being good deep water at all tides close in to the shore. That should such port be opened then Bahrain was doomed, for all its present trade with the mainland would go direct by steamer to the new port and leave Bahrain out. If, on the other hand ZUBAHAH were in Shaikh Isa^ hands this could not happen? Shaikh Isa would gladly never mention ZUBARAH again, if His Majefety^s Government promised not to allow Bin Saud to open a port at A1 Jubail. This statement of the case came as a surprise to me. Abdullah clearly showed that Zubarah was not after all so very much sought after(•5) (g) by luiaikh isa, but was only asked for as a means of bar gaining with Bin Saud, should the latter attempt to develop A1 Jubail. The point is very interesting and gives us a reasonably powerfiil weapon, should we ever want to bring pressure on to the Ruler of Bahrain, (f) Proposal IV , I told Abdullah was a rediculous one to have made# Bahrain existed because of our protecting hand over her, we prevented outside enemies from seizing and devouring her. Her external relations were entirely in our hands, and as such all matters concerning herself and Government must go through the ordinary channels. X ex plained in detail the meaning o^ the term 'Chain of res ponsibility', and further pointed out that Turkey failed because her rulers had always listened to complaints of people over the heads of proper constituted local authority. Abdullah said ' How can we, for instance, complain against a harsh Political Agent? 1 * I showed how easily this could be done, 'Veil' he said 'that is all my father was thinking about when he asked me to make my fourth proposal in London' The meeting ended with Abdullah requesting me to write and ask that an early answer be obtained from His Majefety's Government to the four proposals made. He also asked that I would write and put before higher autho rities the conversation I had had with him, and the real meaning underlying each request. In other words I gathered Shaikh Isa was rather anxious to back out of what he had said. He thinks he has made a mistake and is afraid of getting into hot water. I dc^iot for a moment think that Shaikh Isa will mind if not a single point is conceeded him In fact, knowing Shaikh Isa's and Abdullah's attitude now, I strongly advise that proposals 11, 111,IV,V be rejected and that proposal 1 only be considered in modified form. I tfyJL. should suggest that/people of Hassa proper , Qatif and Qatar only, when present on the Island be put under his con trol, no one el 3e. I suggest that early orders passed to this effect.(S) After saying good-bye to me, Abdullah sent me a very friendly message, saying that now he kne?/ I was a true friend and advisor, because I had spoken straight and frankly and that is what Shaikh isa wanted all along, even in London he himself has believed it to be an unwise move to put forward the proposals made, but he had been -(vO/cC- advised, as also^his father, by w Ah al gharadh^ (i.e people who had an axe to grind).

Persian ^hilf on his recent visit to Bahrain asked me how the work of the ^ajlis al Urfi was getting on. Your friend had to express regret and to inform him that the sitting of the ^ajlis had not taken place from the day that Shaikh Your Excellency's son left for England with Captain Bray M.C., The Resident requested me to communicate with Your Excellency with a view to arranging for the said Majlis to again take place in Manamah as had formerly been arranged between Your Exce llency and my predecessor. Indeed the fact that the ^ajlis al Urfi has not been sitting for so long has caused much extra work to be thrown on the Joint Court, consisting of Your BxcellencyVs representative and myself, and on each occasion it has sat, the court has with great difficulty settled the number of cases which would normally have been sent to the ^ajlis al Urfi. Under the circumstances and acting under the instructions of the D.P.R, and I am now to write to Your iixcellency and requefet that you may see fit to order the ^ajlis al Urfi to again sit as before. The place of assembly to be Customs ^ouse as before. I further beg to inform Your Excellency that the following five people have been selected by me to represent the foreign community in the ^-ajlis :- ( 1) Muhammad Sharif, K.S. (5*) Abdul Aziz Qusaibi. (S) Seth MaharaJ. (4) Hafiz Khanbai Muhammad Ali. (5) Seth Buddha al Banyan. I hope ^our Excellency will approve of their selection. Should you not do so, I will be obliged if you will inform me.^ Similarly I would like you to inform your friend of(S) the five names of members from your Excellency's subjects whom Your Excellency would like to represent you. Your Excellency having approved of the ten names I trust will inform me the date of the first sitting. i myself suggest Thursday the 14th January(gS&gt;nd Rabi al Thani) at ID A.M. as suitable for the first day^ sitting, and thereafter on each successive Thursday. Your friend will always send a ^aib to be present with the Majlis al Urfi when it sits, and doubts whether Your Excellency will do the same.

As, however, he was engaged in your service yesterday at Badiya I have no doubt this excuse will be acceptable to your Excellency As regards attendance of members of the Majlis generally, I think it would be a good thing and will help to keep the members keen and up to the mark if Your Excellency wrote them a circular letter informing them that you expected them not to absent them selves from the Majlis except for reasons of sickness, also that should any one of them be sick and desire to absent himaelf, he should inform Your Excellency in writing the previous day, at the same time writing and expressing his apologies to his fellow rnem- bex^s• I think after receiving such letter from Your Excellency each member will do his level best to always be present on Thurs- j# days, the time appointed by Your Excellency in conjunction withT hav® the honour to he, Your Excellency^ Most Obedient Servant, /?

I iiixve tho honour to rSfer to your letter to Sir Arthur Hirtzel, dated the 4th September 19 19, in which you requested ~ (l). that your father may have equality with the Arab Rulers in his neighbourhood in the exercise of authority over all Arab subjects residing in his territory; that the selection of the members of the Majlis al Urfi may be one of his rights like the Shara and Saliiffah Courtsj that His Majesty's Government will allow him to open the port of 'Zubarah which he alleges is the territory of his forefathers; and that he ma^ be given the privilege of reference'to the seat of Government in London whenever (2) (S) (4) necessary. 2. I am directed to inform you that the Government of India have given these requests their most careful consider ation and I am to make the following reply.- I am to express regret that it is impossible for the Government of India to accede to the request that ybur father should exereise jurisdiction over the subjects of other Arab Rulers residing in Bahrain unless the r:ua.erB concerned themselves make formal agreements with your father to this effect. As to the second request I am to point out that the procedure for the selection of members of the Majlis al Urfif «r\ &amp;) is laid down in the Bahrain Order-in-Council which was promulgated by order of His Majesty the King^Emperor and it is not within the competence of the Government of India to alter this procedure. But it is understood that the Arab representatives in the ^ajlis are in practice always appointed by your father and though this appointment ir subject to the approval of the Political Agent as representative of the protecting Power, you may rest assured that the Political Agent will never disapprove of any proper selection and will not interfere without just cause. With regard to the opening of a port at Zubarah, you are aware'that this question is an old one and nas in the past received much consideration. It has again been career# fully examined, and I am to express regret that in view of the many difficulties which exist, the Government of India do not see their way to permit and assist your father to carry out this project. Your fourth request is to be given the privilege of direct reference to His Majesty's Government in London. It is known to you that the political relations of Bahrain are conducted with the Government of India and it is there fore appropriate that the Government of India and not Hi® Majesty's Government should be addressed by your father. It is unnecessary to add that any commumications he may make will receive the most careful consideration and will, if necessary, be forwarded to His Majesty's Government.

The principal correspondents in the file are the Bahrain Political Agent Major Harold Dickson, the Deputy Political Resident Major Arthur Trevor, the ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah, and Sheikh Isa’s son, Shaikh ‘Abdullāh.The file begins with correspondence relating to the Majlis al-Urfi, with reports that a member of the Majlis had resigned (folios 2-3). In a draft letter to Shaikh ‘Īsá, dated 5 June 1919, Dickson made clear that any changes to the membership of the Majlis had to be agreed with the Political Agent (folio 6-8). A further letter from Dickson to Shaikh ‘Īsá, dated January 1920, asked the ruler why the sessions of the Majlis had stopped, in the wake of Shaikh ‘Abdullāh's visit to London (folio 13). In a letter to Sir Arthur Hertzel of the India Office, Shaikh ‘Abdullāh made four demands on behalf of his father Shaikh ‘Īsá: 1) jurisdiction over foreign nationals from neighbouring states in Bahrain; 2) the right to elect members to the Majlis al-Urfi court; 3) permission to open a port at Zubarah on the Qatar peninsula; 4) the privilege of reference to higher authorities. (folio 18).Much of the remainder of the file is correspondence related to the first of Shaikh ‘Abdullāh's demands, namely, jurisdiction over foreign nationals in Bahrain, and the extent to which this was permissible, given that the British authorities in Bahrain wanted to administer such jurisdiction. A draft letter from Dickson to Ibn Sa‘ūd and Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Thānī of Qatar, dated 14 July 1920, confirmed that their subjects would come under the jurisdiction of His Majesty's Government when in Bahrain (folio 40). Correspondence at the end of the file relates to complaints from Ibn Sa‘ūd over discrimination against Nejdi traders in Bahrain (folio 58), and the running of the Bahrain customs house (folio 55).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002eb#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
