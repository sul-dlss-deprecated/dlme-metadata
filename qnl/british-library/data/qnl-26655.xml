This would have indicated formally that the Hadramaut extended inland to the “violet' line', but in their letter of Foreign Office replied that the time was not opportune to approach the Italian Government in the matter. I am sending a copy of this letter to Blaxter.My dear Baggallay, In Cowell’s absence I am writing in answer to your letter to him No.4967/10/91 of the 26th of august. There is not very much, I am afraid, which we can add to the information which you have already collected, but there are a few points upon which we should like to comment. with reference to the action which was taken in 1932-63 to which you refer in paragraph 4 of your letter, all that we did in that correspondence was to correct the erroneous impression which had previously existed that the Hadhramaut was a distinct area outside the *.den Protectorate. The treaties with the Chiefs of the hadhramaut area are in all respects similar to those concluded with the Chiefs in h.L.B^GQALLAY, ESQ.V 7 in other parte of the Protectorate. There is no reason so far as we can see, why a distinction was ever drawn between tne eastern part of the Protectorate and the western. Nevertheless, it is true that certain action which has been taken in the past has rather given the impression that there was a distinction. The old Colonial Office lists gave the area of the Protectorate as about 9,QOO square miles, and it is only in recent editions of the List that the correct area has been given, viz., 42,000 square miles. Again, it was the distinction drawn in Consular Instructions between the Protectorate and the Hadhramaut which gave rise to the correspondence in 1932-32. The reason for the distinction is probably just an accident. The Uadhramaut was always rather a distinctive area, and it was never thought necessary until recently to apply the terra *den Protectorate to the whole area, though, of course, the position in the Hadhramaut is precisely the same as in the areas nearer to Aden. / .i \ V AsAs regards the questions vrhich you set out in paragraph 7 of yo\n* letter:- (i) is answered fey the enclosure to Warner’s letter to me of the 31st of August, and (iii) will presumnfely fee answered fey Uie India Office. As regards (ii) most of the information which we have on this matter is to fee found in Ingram's Report on the Hadhramaut (Colonial Ho.123)• There is a good tieal of information in this Report about the trifees who are dependent upon the main Hadhramaut trifees and the areas which they cover. This information shows how the .rlbes who come under our influence extend up to the 'ty uarter*’. As regards the boundary between the Aden Protectorate and Muscat, this was tine sib;) ct of corres-&gt;&gt; ence with den in 1935; see the acting Resident’s despatch Ho.146 of the 17th June, 1936, a copy of which wa sent to you on the 24th June, 1935, and connected correa xmdenee. The boundary between uisha and Muscat is at Eaa Dliarbnt All. (iv) We know of no official statement made at any time which might lead the Italian Government to suppose1 suppose that the area under British influence did not extend as far as the daudi AX’ahian and Muscat borders* {v) Though it would be very useful to our case, it sees* unlikely that any official map has been published which shows clearly that there is no such thing as a rt No Man's hand* in the centre of Arabia. The maps of this part of the world usually show no frontiers, but merely the areas of the various tribes. That is what one would expect since the boundaries have been so little known. You will no doubt keep us in touch with developments, and if any explanation in writing is sent to the Italians, we shall be obliged if we may have an opportunity of concurring in the draft.

As Baggallay^ letter (and the Foreign Office memorandum which formed the enclosure) relate in part to the period before 1927, Blaxter has suggested we should enlist your assistance for the period which falls outside the scope of the Colonial Office. We should be grateful for your cooperation. 3. I also enclose a copy of a letter to Blaxter, supplementary to Baggallay^ letter to Cowell of the 13th August. ■ -j ■ Bh:FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1 26th August, 1937 g?.2 y (E 4967/10/91) •'^amediate. lly dear Cowell, Under cover of our letter E 4721/10/91 of the 13th August, we sent you a record of a conversation between the Italian Charg£ d f Affaires and myself about the interpretation of the Rome Understanding of 1927, 2. The task v/hich confronts us now is to construct a case which will make it impossible for the Italian Government to go on maintaining that they were entitled to suppose, when signing the Rome Understanding, that a large area of 'no man f s 'land' existed between the territories of Ibn Saud, the Aden Protectorate and the territories of the Persian Gulf States, and that, in consequence, any steps taken by His Majesty's Government since that date to extend their effective control up to the limits of territory under Saudi Arabian control are a breach of that Understanding. 3. At first sight, the Italian attitude may seem so absurd that it is difficult to take it seriously. But on closer examination it unfortunately appears that, owing to certain things said and done in the past, the construction of our case is not so easy as it might seem. 4. For a start. Signor Crolla is quite right about the maps. Even official War Office maps have sometimes shown a distinction between the Aden Protectorate and the Hadramaut. In addition, semi-official publications like the Colonial Office list have, I think I am right in saying, included descriptions/ H.R. Cowell, Esq., C.M.G. Colonial Office.descriptions of the area of the Aden protectorate which would make it guite possible to suppose at time that it did not extend anything like as far as the confines of Muscat or Saudi Arabia. Philby is fond of pointing to these apparent defects in our title (see e.g. the 'Near East' of the 29th April of this year) and he has been followed by the 'Daily Herald', one of whose articles, dated the 10th June of this year, is worth looking at and has, we know, been largely instrumental in putting their present ideas into the heads of the Italian Government. Furthermore, it was only in 1932 or 1933 (i.e. since the Rome Understanding) that steps were taken to assimilate the position of the Hadramaut Chiefs with that of the Protectorate as at that time defined. Finally, the Rome Understanding unquestionably uses the phrase 'Southern Arabia' without qualification, and, although this was no doubt meant by us in 1927 to refer to the country bordering the Red Sea to the north of the Aden Protectorate, a legal tribunal would be likely to say it meant the whole of the southern part of the Arabian peninsula. 5. To help us in the construction of our case, the Foreign Office Library have prepared a memorandum, of which I enclose a copy, describing the origin and development of our position at Aden. This memorandum in its turn draws attention to two earlier memoranda ('Memorandum respecting the Hadramaut: 'Its extent and relations with His Majesty f s Government' of the 11th November, 1932, and 'Memorandum respecting the boundaries 'in Arabia: Anglo Turkish arrangements' of the ^bth April, 1934), both of vihich were, I think, sent to the Colonial Office at the time. For convenience of reference, however, I enclose further copies herewith. 6. We should be very glad to have observations on this memorandum, and also upon the whole question of the case which/a which must be constructed. 7. It seems to me that, from the present memorandum ^ and earlier memoranda, we can show that the whole of the coast between Aden and Dhofar (i.e. Muscat territory) was under the control of chiefs in treaty relations with His Majesty*s Government from a period well before 1927, and even before 1913. But this still leaves further questions to be answered, some of which can be set out as follows: (i) Were these treaties available to the Italian Government? They all appear in the latest 1933 edition of Aitchison , s Treaties, but it vail be necessary to ascertain also whatvas the earliest edition of these Treaties in which they appear. Or failing Aitchison, were they published in any other form available to the Italian Government? (ii) . Did the territories of the chiefs with whom these treaties were concluded extend inland as far as the Turkish amd Muscat boundary? (iii) Assuming that they did so, was any official pronouncement ever made by us before 1927 (or any official statement issued) which made or should have made it apparent to the Italian Government that they did so? (iv) Conversely, has any official pronouncement or statement ever been made which might have led the Italian Government to suppose that the area under British influence did not extend as far as the Turkish (3audi Arabian) and Muscat borders, or, alternatively, that it only extended as far as a line which could clearly not be made or meant to correspond with what we now say are the Turkish (Saudi Arabian) or Muscat borders? (v) Has any official map ever been published which clearly/% |5) clearly showed that no such thing as 'no man’s land' existed in the centre of Arabia? 3. I also enclose a note made of an interesting point connected with a certain Italian prize decision during the war of 1912 with Turkey, v/hich has a bearing on this question. In addition to the potential ammunition contained in this note, the fact that the Kaiti and Mahri tribes are mentioned in the Order-in-Council of the 14th October, 1913, about the Slave Trade Act is a useful point. 9. I may say that we are inclined to think here that the Italian G-overnment are labouring under a genuine sense of grievance, and that in any case, v/hether they are or not, our proper course is to act as though they were and furnish them with a reply explaining fully and patiently with chapter and verse why we think they are wrong. It is for this reason that we shall welcome your cooperation in the construction of our case, 10► I ought also to explain that Signor Crolla has told me since our conversation that he had prepared the draft of a private letter, but had on reflexion decided that he had better have its terms approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Unless and until he sends this letter, I do not think we shall offer the Italians any explanation in writing. But whether he writes or not, the question may be raised during the Anglo- Italian discussions to take place at Rome next month. The matter is therefore fairly urgent. Yours sincerely, (Signed) Lacy Baggaliay.I 'V Q &lt;opy (F. 4967/10/91) c toxAjg. Although It im not intended that thie memorandum anould deal with evente prior to the Britieh occupation, it may fee said that the Government of Bombay iaaued instructions in 183? for endeavours to fee made to obtain Aden by purchaae in order that British Commerce in the fced iea might fee placed on a safer footing for the future and that a secure coal depot for tne vesaela engaged in the overland transit might fee established. On January 23, 1838 a written bond was obtained from the iultan at Lahel stating that he would cede the peninsula to the Britieh in the following March in consideration of an annual pension of 8,700 dollars. Following the committal of further outrages against British shipping and the failure of the Cultan to honour his agreement of 1838, Aden was bombarded and occupied fey British troops on January 16, 1839. (2) fthlle it seems unnecessary to go into details it may fee stated that information concerning the measures tajcen for the pacification of the tribes of the hinterland and of the various rebellions etc. during the period 1839 - 1872 is contained in Captain Playfair’s ’History *of Arabia Felix or Yemen* (8vo. 4972) and in S^ajor General Tremenheere* s * Report on the Various Arab ’♦Tribes in the neighbourhood of Aden...' (8vo. 5556). The texts of the various treaties concluded by the Britieh Government (The East India Co.) at Aden and the neighbouring chiefs//“N chief® during this same period art contained in Michigan, Volume XI of 1933. (3) It ia to be observed tnat on April 2nd, 1S69, the Ptnlfiaula of Jebel ihaan, or Little Aden, eat purchased for the sum of / 30,000 the stipend of /AO per month paid to the hhmlKh of the Afcrabees. (4) ^hen in 1873 the TurJct, who had evacuated the Yemen in 1&amp;33, reoccupied that province, there were nine tribes in the Hinterland of Aden with whom Her Majesty's Government had direct relatione, and whom they considered to be more or less under their protection. These tribes were the 4bdali, the ^adhli, the Akrabi, and the Lubaihi, which were the nearest to Aden; the Hauahabi, the Alawi, the Amiri (i.e., the subjects of the Amir of 1 thali), the faffai, and the Aulaki. These two last-named tribes were divided into two sections, the vpper and Lower Yaffai and the Upper and Lower Aulaki. (5) The Turkish Government contended that the ult&amp;n*s sovereignty extended over those tribes in virtue of the former occupation of Yemen. &amp;e, on the other hand, always maintained that they were independent. In addition to the Turkish claim of sovereignty, there have, ever since 1873, been constant disputes in regard to the frontiers between these tribes and the territory under the direct administration of the Turkish authorities. Both subjects have from time to time given rise to discussions, sometimes of an acute nature, with the Porte. (b) In 1873 it wss proposed that the nine tribes above named should be ta*en under British protection. The proposal was not sanctioned; but while the question was/was undwr conftidwration at hom« 9 the Keuident at Aden had* under Inatrueticm* from India* nent a Britlfth force to ftupport the Chief of LaheJ (in the territor/ of the Abdali tribe) against the Turka, who were giving military aaelstance to a rebel against the Chief. The Turkish Government endeavoured to make a bargain that, ae they had disclaimed any intention to interfere, the British force should be withdrawn from LaheJ. Thle waft declined, % ; i it was not until the Turkish troops had evacuated hahej that the British force returned to Aden. The right of the Porte to request the withdrawal of the British troops was at the same time expressly denied by the Secretary of 5. tate for India, ’’since the relations of the f *Britleh Government with the tribes round Aden are ' Independent of Turkey, whom we do not admit to have any ■'locus standi in that region. ' (7) In the same year (1873) Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople informed the Porte that Her Majesty*a overnment would not tolerate the interference of the Ottoman authorities in the territory of the nine tribes. The Intrigues and interference of the Turkish officials nevertheless continued in the following years, and in 1885 culminated in a more decided forward movement, resulting in the occupation of Jalela, in the heart of the Amiri country, and several other villages belonging to the Amir of othali. (8) Her Majesty*• Government protested against this occupation, though Jalela was not mentioned, but the Turks were in strong force at the time, and nothing more was said than that Her Majesty's Government could not/not •cquieec® in the indefinite occupation of the ^mir** villages. In the autumn of 1888 the whole subject of our relatione with the Aden tribee wee discussed, and certain proposals were made which were referred to the Government of India. These proposals were to the effect that, of the nine tribes, the four nearest to Aden (the Ab&amp;eli, Lubaihi, krabi, and Fadhll) concluded with the Chiefs} that Agreements should be concluded with the haushabi and Alawi and with the Lower Yaffai, binding them not to sell their territories, or accept the domination of any ether Fower; that the Ipper Taffai and the Aulsfcl should be left independent; and that as regards the remaining tribe - the Amiri - we should quietly desist from our present attitude of opposition to the Turks, allowing the absorption by them of the hamlets on the uplands, and possibly pensioning off the Amir and his immediate successors. should be placed under British protection by Agreements themselves in favour of these proposals, but (i) In 1886 the Oovermaent of India expressednine tribes. km regards the substitution of s rotectorste form of Treaty for one binding tne chiefs not to sell their territories or accept the interference of any other Power* Lord Salisbury expressed the opinion that ’the responsibility incurred by the British Government in either case is much the seme* while s ’Treaty of Protectorate gives a more complete control and ‘is more efficient to counteract interference by foreign “Powers than the less definite Agreement previously H suggee ted. w (10) In 1890 Protectorate Treaties were ratified with the Fadhli, Akrabi* Lower Aulski* and certain Atifi and Bashaml sections of the lubaihi* and also with the principal Chiefs* along the coast* east of the Aulaki* as far as the Muscat frontier; in 1895, with the Haushabi, Alawi* and Lower Yaffai; in and 1904* in consequence ol the difficulties experienced by our Commissioners during the work of delimitation with Multan Ihstan of the Upper faffal* and with three sections* of that tribe, with two Sheikhs representing the Upper Aulaki,^ and with the Chief of Behao-el—Kasab; and in 1905 (after the completion of the delimitation) with the .miri. As regard# the Abdali* the fact that the territories of the cultan were already under British protection was recognised in an Agreement of 1888. (11) In 1900 a Turkish subject erected a fort at Ad Dareja/ a Could these 'principal chiefs' be indicated? The point la rather important. « Dthali, $aueatta* and Muflahai. &amp; Yeshbum and Hikb.Ad iJareja, in the heufihabi territory. Diplomatic repreaentatione proved unavailing, and a force had to he sent fron Aden in *fuly 1^01 to expel the intruder®, who were aealeted in their reelttance by Ottoman troops. Further encroachments in Amiri territory were reported, and in October 1901 the Government of India suggested a delimitation of the frontier, an independent proposal to the same effect being made almost at the same time by the Ottoman Government. (i8) The proposal i*as accepted, and the Commissioners met at hthali, the chief village of the Amiri, in February, 1902. (Id) It transpired, however, that the Turks had utilized the interval before the Consfissioners met to occupy with regular troops and artillery a number of points in Amiri territory which had hitherto been in the possession of the fcheifch, among other Jaleia, which they had previously occupied in 18a5. They also established irregular Arab levies over s great part of the Amiri territory, terrorising the natives and making them believe that Turkish rule was to be established. (14) The Turkish troops and levies had orders to prevent any British party from moving about for purposes of survey or inquiry, and persons attached to the CMmlssien were actually fired on. His Majesty’s Government protested against these enoroactimenta withou %/without reault, and eventually, to ease the situation. It *r*a proooaed in June that the dalimitation of the Amiri country should ba postponed, and that the delimitation of tfca country of tha faffal (anotuer of the nine tribes), lying to the north-aaet of the Amiri, should be proceeded with. This led to no reault, as, though the Turkish Government professed to accept tne proposal, the Commissioners on the spot received instructions not to recognise the Yaffal as one of the nine tribes. A complete deadlock ensued, tha Turkish Government being unable or unwilling to control their local authorities, (15) in these circumstances, it was decided, on tha recommendation of ir K. O’t oner* that Ur. ntsmaurice, second dragoman of tha 1 mbaaay at Constantinople, should be appointed to the Demarcation Cooiimiesion aa Joint Conmisaioner and he joined the Commission at Dthali at the and of November. (16) In December 1902, His majesty’s Goverivnent reluctantly decided that it was neceasary to aend up troops to support the Commission at hthali and to reinforce the Aden garrison from India. Four hundred men and four guna were accordingly sent early in January 1*K&gt;3 to Btftail, and reinforeamenta were sent from Indie to Aden. In order to prevent the arrival of Turkish reinforcements at hodeida, Hia Majesty*a ahipa “Hermione'and Intrepid” were eent to Aden from the Mediterranean. May the force on the DthaXl plateau and on the eommunscat ions had been increased to about i 9 &amp;00. (IT) These proceedings had a good result. rdere # were sent frow Constantinople in February which caused the local authorities to modify their attitude, but it was not till towards the end of &amp;arch 1903 that the levies were finally disbanded, and the Turkish forces withdrawn behind the line which His Majesty*s Government had claimed provisionally for the Chief of Lthali, leaving Jalela in his possession. With this withdrawal of the Tur&amp;iah troops the preliminary difficulties disappeared, and delimitation, in the proper gene# of the word, may be said to have begun - thirteen months after the meeting of the Coinmiasions. Though organised obstruction ceased with the withdrawal from yalela, it w©?&gt; some time before the excitement created in the tribal country ceaaed, and progress was at first slow. However, in May 1903 it was possible to withdraw the ahipa. In June a proper survey of the Amiri border was completed, and the British proposals as to the general line to be followed by the demarcation were referred to Constantinople. in September and October the nhalbi country up to the uadi Bana was surveyed by the Joint (oromiaaloners, and a line agreed to and demarcated* in October the actual demarcation of the Amiri country was begun by the/tif Joint Cot*il&amp; ioru re, tm doubtful points as they arose being settled by negotiations at Constantinople 9 and it was completed towards the end of Xmtoibmr 1905* The Haushabl territory was dealt with by the Commission in January and February 1904* (19) The delimitation of the Subalhl border involved considerable delay (Sq) ?he proposals of is ajeaty's Ovr&amp;m sent for the mttle mnt of the outstanding portion of the frontier beyond mdarlba (up to whioh point there was no difference of opinion between the two Governments) were embodied in a hemorandu^ presented to the fortm by Sir H. C’Conor on the 11th August, 1904. (21) There was considerable controversy about the districts of J&gt;sbiani f hawa f Jubast f and Hubeaten 9 which the Ottoman Government claimed as part of their district of Had a, but they were considered by His Majesty's Government, on satisfactory evidence, to be connected with th# Yaffai, and thus to fall within the British irotectorate. ( 22) On the £3rd September Sir H« O r Jonor* reported that, at a farewell audience before h* left Constantinople, the Sultan 'opened the conversation by as uring me that he 'would give his formal consent to the Aden frontier ''delimitation next d*y% This undertaking, however, was not observed. (23) On the 25th October Lord hansdoens found it naees ary to instruct Mr* Townley to inform the itirte that Bis Majesty's Government proposed to send a ship of war to the coast to watch over British Interests, aM the Admiralty gave orders to the GowmnAor~ln-&lt;Xiiot on the ast indies Station to send a ship. (24) On the 28th setob^r Mr* Townley reported that the Minister/Minister for Foreign Affairs begged that the dispatch of the ahip night be delayed, and promised an anaeer by the 8rd pow^bttr* (^8) On the 4th November hr* Townley telegraphed that the aulta» # a reply had been handed to him in the ah npm of a telegram to the Turkish ambassador for oomminloatton to Lord 1 ansdoane, but that, having regard to the terns, he had refused to act on it* on the mm day the Turkish ambassador presented the reply to Lord L&amp;nsdovne. It spoke of the line proposed for the &amp;ub&amp;lhl border as a ** narked M enoroa«linfent w f olai^ed , ablani, nma, * uban, and aubeaten as 'belonging incontestably to the Rase of kada”, and begged for a reopening of the question* Lord ,.ansdowne replied by reciting the &amp;ulten's promise of the S5rd September and the failure to give effect to it. He said it was 'outrageous that at tha last moment an attempt should be 'made to reopen the joeation;* and that the arrangements for sending a ship of war to the coast, which had been suspended at the A^asaador’s special request, would certainly now be carried out. (86) On the 60th Bneewibsr jsr. Toenlsy reported that an Irade had bern issued instructing the Turkish Com 1scloners to draw the boundary outside Bab~el~ *ndeb to Kudam (the Vilayet of the Yemen retaining Turba and the sells, as also the territory bounded by a line terminating at Sheikh Mirad). The wording of this Iradl betrayed complete ignorance of the question, and also stated that neither Government was to be allowed to seind troops into the Mine Cantons. Fo mention was mde of the delimitation of the boundary north-east to the desert, but a promise was given that no portion of the territory/2 ? territory would he ceded to a third i over* (2T) Hie MaJ^aty f e Ooverr^nt decided that the stipulation as tt&gt; the dispatch of troops to the Mne Clantons was Inadmissible f snd Ur* Townley was inctructcd to press for compliance with the original desands 9 including ths recognition of the north-eastern frontier.

On this understanding Hi© majesty *8 Govern nt were ready to demarcate the line fro® ^udariba to sheikh s ursd, but should fresh difficulties be raised by the Port* , His Majesty's Government ould be obliged to decline all further negotiations, and would take their own measures for defining the line they considered it necessary to claim, *nd for maintaining their rights over territory included in it.

In his reply of 5th November, 1913, Hakki Pasha intimated that his Government were of opinion that the opportunity should be taken to ratify, not only the protocol of 1905, but also that of 1903. Following further investigation in the Foreign Office it was decided that to complete the records of the boundary settlement it would be necessary to ratify the protocols of 1903, 1904, and 1905.

A somewhat similar but shorter statement was made in ansv/er to a question in the House of Commons on June 29, 1903 (Parliamentaiy; Debates Volume 124, pages 791-792). In response to a motion from Lord Reay on July 11, 1905 the Secretary of State for India made the following reply:) 'As to the Aden Hinterland, a line has been demarcated 'from Sheikh Hurahad, on the coast opposite Perim, to the River 'Sana, embracing the Subaihi, the Haushabi, and the Amiri 'tribes. From the Bana it is agreed that the line should go 'in a north-easterly direction as far as the desert, but it has 'not been considered necessary by the two Governments (the 'British and Turkish) actually to demarcate this line. In this 'demarcation we have followed the representations made as far 'back as 1873 by Lord Granville to the Turkish Government. No 'tribes have been transferred from one sphere of influence to 'another on either side, and our liabilities and responsibilities 'remain unaltered. Direct British administration has never 'been established over these tribes, and is not established 'now. They are under a protectorate, and the policy of the 'Government always has been to refrain from intervention in 'their tribal affairs. '¥e have, hov/ever, recognised that there are certain duties 'which the tribes ought to perform. The representations of '1873 were based upon treaties with sections of the tribes. 'Arrangements have been made with other sections of the same 'tribes on the same lines as formerly, with the exception of 'one in the case of the Amir of Dthala. We on our side give 'protection and a small subsidy to the tribes. On their side 'they permit no foreign interference, undertake that there will 'be/no alienation of territory except with the consent of the 'British Government, and maintain the trade routes. The 'county of the Amir of Dthala was that in which we had trouble 'some time ago, and the tv/o Governments have now been able to 'come to an agreement with regard to delimitation, but it has 'always been exposed to difficulties from the Turkish side of 'the frontier. In his treaty, therefore, special provision has 'been added that he should protect the boundary pillars, keep 'order within his own boundary, and keep a small force of not 'more than fifty men to enforce his authority. His subsidy 'has been increased for that purpose, yhile we have not in 'in any way extended our liabilities, we have reduced the chance 'of trouble by having a clear and definite understanding as to 'the boundary and the obligations of the tribes on each side of 'the frontier'.

Memorandum respecting the Boundaries in Arabia: Anglo-Turkish A rrangements. [With Map.] Aden Protectorate. IN 1873 the Ottoman Government advanced a claim to sovereignty over the whole of the area that had at one time been in possession of the Imams of the Yemen, including tribal areas in South-West Arabia, with the rulers of which the British Government were in special treaty relations. The British Government, in reply, maintained that the rulers of these tribes were independent. There followed a period of frequent encroachments by Turkish authorities into the protectorate, of British representations and Turkish assurances, and of British measures to protect the tribes, until, in 1901, the Government of India and the Ottoman Government both proposed that the frontier should be demarcated. In 1902 frontier commissioners met and carried out demarcation on the ground. The results were embodied in three protocols of 1903, 1904 and 1905 respectively. Formal ratification was delayed until 1914, the agreement arrived at in 1905 being completed and ratified in the Anglo- Turkish Convention of the 9th March, 1914. The text will be found in C.P. 10517. Ratifications of this convention were exchanged at London on the 3rd June, 1914. 2. After the war, the Imam of the Yemen refused to recognise the frontier agreed upon in the 1914 convention, and revived the ancient claims of his predecessors. A situation similar to that in the last part of the 19th century subsequently prevailed, until a treaty was concluded with the Imam at Sanaa on the 11th February, 1934, which included a mutual undertaking providing for the maintenance of the situation in regard to the frontier as it existed on the date of signature of the treaty^ 1 ) and for the prevention of any violation of this frontier pending negotiations for its final settlement. These negotiations are to be initiated before the expiration of the present treaty, which is to remain in force for forty years. This treaty has not yet been ratified. Persian Gulf Principalities. 3. In March 1911 the Ottoman Government formally intimated to His Majesty’s Government their wish that a precise definition might be reached as to the respective position of the two countries, commercially and politically, in the Persian Gulf, His Majesty’s Government being concerned in view of their special treaty relations with the Arab rulers on the Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf. The ensuing negotiations resulted in the signature at London of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913 (see C.P. 10515). This convention, inter alia, recognised Koweit as an autonomous Kaza of the Ottoman Empire, and established its boundaries, and contained Turkish renunciation of rights in Qatar. The boundary of the Ottoman Sanjak of Nejd was not delimited in detail, apart from where it marched with that of Koweit, but was described generally in the convention as a line commencing at a point on the Persian Gulf a little to the south of Uqair, opposite the Island of Zakhnuniyah* running due south into the Ruba-al-Khali desert, until it met parallel 20° N. r after which it turned and continued in a south-westerly direction in a straight line to meet Lakmat-esh-Shub, the most easterly point reached in the delimitation of the Aden Protectorate boundary. ( x ) One of the conditions attached by His Majesty’s Government to their consent to the conclusion of the treaty was that certain portions of the territory of the Aden Protectorate which were still in Yemeni occupation should be evacuated. The British Resident at Aden reported that prior to signature of the treaty this condition had been fulfilled. His Majesty’s Government have reserved their right to claim the district of Rubeiatein, which at present remains in the Imam’s possession. 7435 [81 gg 2] B EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL.'1 4. This convention was not ratified, but, with the exclusion of Turkey frcan the Arabian peninsula, His Majesty’s Government have maintained that the frontiers of Turkey’s successors, Ibn Saud and the Imam of the \emen, should be confined within the limits of the former Ottoman hmpire as defined m the conventions of 1913 and 1914. The question of the extent to which these conventions could be invoked was. examined in 1928, in connexion with the^ concession of the Turkish (now Iraq) Petroleum Company. In a Library memorandum of the 24th January, 1928 [ E 330/94/65], it is stated : “ It may be objected that, as the convention of the 29th July, 1913, was never ratified, and that, as the ratifications of the convention of the 9th March, 1914, were not exchanged until the 3rd June, 1914, neither of these documents can be invoked as evidence of the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire on the 19th March, 1914. “ An answer to that, so far as the Persian Gulf is concerned, would be that the negotiations of 1913 were instituted in order to provide for the maintenance of the territorial status quo and for the regularisation of a condition of affairs which had, in view of His Majesty’s Government, already existed for many years. “ The attitude of successive British Governments had been that, prior to Midhat Pasha’s expedition of 1871, there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction, effective or ineffective, south or east of Ojeir.f 2 ) There was nothing in the history of Muscat, of the Trucial Coast, of Bahrein, or of El Katr, which reflected Ottoman predominance. On the other hand, Great Britain had repudiated Turkish claims to sovereignty over Bahrein eighteen times, and had frequently informed the Porte that the Ottoman claim to sovereignty over El Katr could not be, and never had been, recognised by Great Britain. “ The answer as regards the Aden Convention would seem to be that, although it was not ratified until the 3rd June, 1914, an arrangement was made for its enforcement pending ratification. Apart from this, however, for many years the attitude of His Majesty’s Government had been that they did not acknowledge the title of the Porte to the country lying at or beyond the mouth of the Red Sea. “ As regards the Hadramaut, all the tribes had long been under British protection, and the leading sheikhs stipendiaries of the British Government. “ It is to be noted that, although Koweit was regarded by His Majesty’s Government as an autonomous Kaza of the Turkish Empire, the Sheikh of Koweit had undertaken to grant an oil concession in his territory only to a nominee of the British Government. Koweit may therefore for present purposes be regarded as outside Turkish territory.” 5. Since the war, with the exception of the frontier between Nejd and Koweit, which was defined in the Nejd-Koweit Agreement of the 2nd December, 1922, no definition has been reached in agreement with Ibn Saud of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Nejd. Library memorandum of the 17th October, 1927 [E 4330/104/65/1927], dealing with the frontier between Nejd and Qatar, contains the following paragraphs :— “ By article 11 of the (unratified) Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, the boundary between El Katr and Nejd was described as a line running from the extreme end of the gulf opposite the Island of Zakhnuniyah due south to Ruba-al-Khali (see blue line on map 2 attached to the convention of 1913). “ By article 6 of the treaty of the 26th December, 1915, between Great Britain and the Sultan of Nejd, the latter promised to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of El Katr. “ During a visit which Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner at Bagdad, paid to Ibn Saud in November and December 1922, the question of the status of El Katr came under notice in connexion with~a project for the grant of an oil concession for a tract of Nejd territory. Sir P. Cox, who found that in his discussions with the engineer representing the aspirant concessionnaires Ibn Saud had apparently included the Katr peninsula within the area for which he was prepared to negotiate a concession, at once took Ibn Saud to task, reminded him that he had nothing to do with ( 2 ) That is south or east of the line dividing Nejd and El Katr.3 El Katr except to respect it under the terms of the treaty of 1915, and insisted on the limitation of his discussions to the country west of the longitude of the head of Salwah Bay, i.e., the line laid down in the Anglo- Turkish Convention, 1913, and marked in blue on map 2 annexed thereto. “ As Ibn Saud accepted this injunction without argument and nothing , later appears to have transpired, it may reasonably be held that the line of 1913 still constitutes the frontier between El Katr and Nejd.” 6. In February 1934 a despatch was received from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora [E 1206/1206/91/1934] reporting the receipt of a request from the United States Embassy for a copy of the “ Anglo-Turkish Treaty of the 29th July, 1913, which delimited the frontiers between Aden and the Ottoman dominions and between Muscat and the Ottoman dominions.” It was assumed in the Foreign Office that this request was connected with the operation of the Hasa Oil Concession by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, and it was held to be desirable that the position of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the boundaries mentioned should be made clear to the United States Government, and that the United States Embassy at Angora should be put in possession of all the relevant treaty texts. After consultation with the India Office, a despatch was sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora on the 22nd March, 1934 [E 1839/1206/91/1934]’ instructing Sir P. Loraine to com municate a copy of the 1913 convention to the United States Embassy, and to show them a copy of the 1914 convention, which, unlike the 1913 convention, had been published. In this despatch the view was definitely taken that the fact that certain territories on the Ottoman side of the 1913-14 line had now become independent States, could not be regarded in the view of His Majesty’s Govern ment as in any way affecting the status of the territories on the other side of that line, which His Majesty’s Government regarded as forming the boundary between the Ottoman Succession State of Saudi Arabia and the territories of South- Eastern Arabia with which they were in special relations. Sir P. Loraine was instructed to call the attention of the United States Embassy to the fact that the 1913 convention was not ratified, but to point out to them, in support of the view taken by His Majesty’s Government of the validity of the line laid down therein, that that line was mentioned, adequately defined and definitely adopted in article 3 of the 1914 convention, which had been ratified. 7. One point arising out of the question of the 1913-14 frontier line is whether that line should be regarded as merely establishing the limits of Saudi Arabian territory or whether it also lays down the boundaries of the territories of Arab rulers with whom His Majesty’s Government are in special treaty relations. After Mr. Philby’s expedition into the Ruba-al-Khali in 1932, the Saudi Arabian paper, the Umm-al-Qura, in publishing an account of the expedition, advanced a claim to Saudi Arabian sovereignty over the districts visited. The Foreign Office then decided not to take the initiative in examining questions of territorial claims in the Ruba-al-Khali. The question of the territorial limits of Qatar has, how ever, arisen in connexion with the operation of the Hasa Oil Concession (see paragraph 6 above). Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson, Political Agent at Koweit, who was present with Sir Percy Cox at the Uqair negotiations with Ibn Saud in November and December of 1922 already referred to, has furnished a report 'E 279/279/91/1934] on the discussions which then took place regarding the Nejd-Qatar boundary. According to this report, Ibn Saud produced Hunter’s map of Arabia 1-inch to 32 miles, on which was marked in blue pencil the area which he proposed to grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate for their con cession. This area included the whole of the Hasa Province and the Qatar peninsula, the south-western and southern boundary of the concession being marked by a line drawn down the Wadi Faruq as far as Jaw-ad-Dukhan and then turning east from there to Khor-adh-Dhuwaihin on the coast. Sir Percy Cox marked in red pencil on the map a line from Jaw-ad-Dukhan to Dohat Salwa, saying to Ibn Saud : “ That is the line,” and crossed out the incorrect line marked in blue. It will be noticed that the line marked by Sir P. Cox was not in accordance with that laid down in the 1913 convention. As it was not clear whether Sir P. Cox intended to indicate the frontier between Nejd and Qatar or whether he was merely warning Ibn Saud against assuming sovereignty east of the red line on the map, and as Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson’s report (written more than ten years after the event) contained nothing to show that mention was [81 gg—2] B 2made of the 1913 convention line, it was considered desirable to consult Sir P. Cox on the sub ject. In a discussion held at the India Office on the 20th February, 1934 ; E 1302/279/91/1934], Sir P. Cox expressed his conviction that the 1913 con vention line was never mentioned during the 1922 discussions with Ibn baud, and expressed the opinion that any view then expressed by him incidentally and extempore could not reasonably be regarded as an official pronouncement of the Hasa-Qatar boundary; he added that in any case he had informed Ibn baud His Majesty’s Government should be consulted before any concession was granted. 8. ' No decision has yet been reached regarding the status of the territory immediately to the east of the 1913 convention line, but the despatch to Sir P. Loraine mentioned in paragraph 6 above contained a warning as to the position, and instructed him, should it be found necessary to give the United States Embassy any oral explanations on the matter, to avoid referring to tnis territory as specifically forming part of the State of Qatar itself, but to refer to it merely as being under British influence. 9 In a despatch of the 11th April, Sir P. Loraine reported that he had spoken to the United States Ambassador on the 2nd April in the sense of the instructions summarised in paragraph 6 of this memorandum [E 2435/1206/91/ 1934], but that he had not found it necessary to refer to Qatar. The United States Embassy in London were also similarly informed on the 24th April of the position as regards the frontiers laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914, copies of which were sent to them [E 2481/279/91/1934]; here again no specific reference was made to Qatar, the phrase used being “ the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the British spheres of influence in South-Eastern Arabia.” This action was taken in order that the position might be made clear to the Standard Oil Company of California, who were carrying out aerial surveys which His Majesty’s Government feared might otherwise be extended over the frontier laid down in the convention of 1913. In addition, instructions were sent to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda on the 21st April [E 2481/279/91/1934] to address a formal note to the Saudi Arabian Government, informing them of the request of the United States Embassy at Angora, and of the action taken, enclosing copies of the conventions of 1913 and 1914, and explaining the view of His Majesty’s Government as to the validity of the frontiers laid down therein. This explana tion was to be on the lines laid down in the despatch to bir P. Loraine summarised in paragraph 6 of this memorandum, Sir A. Ryan’s attention also being called to the position as regards Qatar. Sir A. Ryan addressed a note accordingly to the Saudi Arabian Government on the 28th April [E 2662/279/91/1934]. In^ this note, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, he used the expression ‘ ‘ for convenience of reference ” in communicating copies of the conventions of 1913 and 1914, in order to indicate the assumption that the Saudi Arabian Government already had knowledge of both. 10.
