Pr - P f nel 4-S jLii]4^a Office on M onday. 9th Q ctobex^JjO^M^MeiL^ question of foreign consular repres ej^too^in the Persian Gulf. There were present Mr. Laithwaite (in the Chair), Lieutenant Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.n., Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf, and Mr. K.R.Johnstone, Foreign Office. Mr. Laithwaite said that the meeting arose ^ P c ) out of Bushire despatch Mo.847 S oi 20tn July uo the Government of India on the subject of foreign consular representation in BaJnrein. 3he Government ^ P u of India had since intimated that they saw no objection to the discussion of the points in issue by the Political Resident during his leave in this country, but that they wished to be informed of what took place at the discussion and consulted before any decision was taken. 2. The question had arisen in connection with the possibility of an American request to be allowed consular representation in Bahrein; out it seemed desirable not merely to deal with this specific point, but also so far as possible to endeavour to reach agreement on certain broad principles as regards foreign consular representation in the Gulf States. The question was probably a live one in Bahrein and Koweit only, (the position of Muscat being of course special) though it might arise in Qatar in the event of oil being developed in that principality/' 2 . 0 •v\ x principality. There was no likelihood at this stage of the question of foreign consular representation arising in the frucial area. 3, The meeting first discussed the question of the action to be taken in the event of the American Vice-Consul at Bushire repeating his visit to Bahrein/showing signs of consular activity or raising the question whether there would be any objection to his performing consular acts in that Principality. The Acting Political Resident had suggested that it might be sufficient on the first occasion, if the Consul were to show signs of such activity, for the political Agent to draw his attention to the Exclusive Agreement of 1892, between the Sheikh of Bahrein and H.M.G* If the question were then, to arise of the Consul performing some specific act at Bahrein, such as the solemnisation of marriage, which was not within the powers of the Political Agent, the political Agent nugdit reply that as a matter of courtesy he would raise no objection on that particular occasion provided that a. request for the art war made by the person concerned through the Political Agent. The Political Agent might add, should circumstances appear to necessitate this, that the question of future procedure would be referred to H.M.G. 4. The general sense of the meeting was in favour of action on the lines suggested by the Acting Political Resident, with the modification however that it would be undesirable that the American Consul should be allowed to perform in his consular ,. capacity any special act even as a matter of courtesy. 5 ./ I3 . 5. The meeting then turned to consider the possi bility of laying down general principles applicable in the case of Koweit and Bahrein and possibly Qatar, The India Office suggested these might be as follows:- (a) that we should oppose any attempt to establish foreign consular representatives;. (b) that we should if necessary arrange for the ruler concerned to inform us that he was strongly opposed to t heirest ablishment; (c) that if any foreign Power were to raise thepoint we should explain our special Treaty relation with the States in question, and the objections of the local ruler, adding that we were not prepared to bring pressure to bear upon the ruler in the matter, but that we would gladly give our fullest good offices to any of the citizens of the interested Foreign Powders who might find themselves in the Sheikhdoms concerned and would instruct our representative to look after their interests; (d) that, in the events referred to in (c) above it might be possible by friendly arrangement with the foreign Power concerned to agree, should that Power consider a mere offer of good offices in general that insufficient„/4cts which are normally consular acts such as the solemnisation of marriage should be performed as a matter of couttes}^ (but not as Consular Acts) by the Political Agent, whose action in the matter would be recognised by the interested foreign Powers. 6. Mr, hajthwaite referred to the previous history of this question. The position of Muscat was special. It was an independent State with foreign treaties of its own and it would not be possible for us to take exception to a request by an interested foreign Power to establish a consulate at Muscat. The meeting agreed. 7. The Sheikh of Koweit was precluded by his Treaty engagements from receiving the representatives of any foreign power save with the-approval of There had been considerable correspondence between 1924/4 . 1924 and 1932 as to the possibility of appointing Persian, Iraqi, or Saudi consular representatives in the Sheikhdom. The Sheikh im o. taken the strongest exception to any such proposal and it had been necessary to overrule him before we could undertake even to offer our gooa offices to Persian subjects in Koweit. (We had in this connection informed the Persian Government in 1924 that the appointment of a Persian representative even in an honorary capacity would be contrary to the Agreement of 1899 between the sheikh and H.M.G. and that any departure from this agreement in favour of Persia would create a precedent which would prove embarrassing in the event of any other Powers proposing to appoint representatives.) When a suggestion was made at the beginning of 1930 that an Iraqi Vice Consul should be appointed at Koweit, Sir Francis Humphrys was similarly instructed to reply that were not prepared, having regard to the Agreement of 1899, to sanction the appointment of foreign consular representatives and the natter was not pursued by the Iraqi Government. The Saudi Government had raised the question ~~~ in 1932 with sir Hugh Biscoe, but had dropped it on their attention being drawn to the fact that the' grant of consular status/5. status to their representatives would make it difficult for us to refuse a consular concession to the Persians. 8. In tlie case of Bahrein the political Resident and the Government of India had been definitely opposed in 1928 to a proposal, made with the object of reconciling Persia to the abandonment of her claims to the Islands, to establish a Persian Agent in the island for face-saving purposes and had reported that such a proposal would have to be forced on the Sheikh with bad reactions a long the Arab littoral. The appointment of any foreign consular representative would make it difficult to refuse a similar concession to the Persians and the Saudi Government and it seemed probable that the objections of the sheikh of Bahrein to any such proposal would be no less definite than those of the sheikh of Koweit. 9. Colonel Powle expressed his general agreement with the suggested principles and with the course of action outlined above. He said that the Sheikh of Koweit had on the past and would still be very strongly opposed to any foreign representation in his State. The same was true of the Sheikh of Bahrein. Apart from any general political objections to the establishment of foreign representation such representation would have to be forced on the/6 . W the sheikh. If tiie Sheikh was definitely obstinate, while we might overrule him as we had in Koweit, as regards the grant of good offices to foreign subjects, it would be most difficult, if not impossible, for us to oblige him to accept foreign repre sentative s. 10* Mro Johnstone said that he thought the Foreign Office would not, in the light of the HesidenVs remarks, be disposed to dissent from the principles under discussion. It could not, however, be overlooked that while we might shelter behind the Sheikhs in refusing to accept foreign representatives, we should he quite unable to convince foreign Powers that the sheikh was not in fact acting under our instructions. This might lead to some difficulties. 11. Colonel Fowle admitted that this might he the case. But e ven so it made no difference to the facts. Tide objection of the local rulers was real and sincere. In any event foreign Powers could not get behind our statement. 12. As:regards principle (d) above Mr. Johnstone stated that there appeared to he three particular consular acts in regard to which difficulty was most likely to arise between the Political Agents at Bahrein or Koweit and foreign nationals, namely the solemnisation of marriages, the/* . 0 r q tne registration of births and deaths and the granting of extensions to visas. As regards the first and second - apart from any exceptions which foreign Governments might be inclined to make in the case of marriages, similar to the recognition accorded in English common law to marriages in uncivilised countries contracted in any solemn form - it would in any case be necessary to obtain the consent of the foreign Government concerned to the opening of registers of marriages, births and deaths recognised by them. And as regards the e xtension of visas, this function also coula clearly only be delegated to British Political Officers with the consent of the foreign Government concerned. 13. The general sense of the meeting was that it would be best, subject to acceptance of the general principles suggested above ' by higher authority in the departments concerned and oy tne Government of India, to aeal with specific incidents as they might arise.

Johnstone, enclosing the provisional minutes of s meeting held et the Indie Of iice on Monday, the 9th October, to consider the question of foreign consulsr representation in the Persian Gulf, T em directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request yon to inform Secretary Sir Samuel !fo*re, that, with the reservations set out below, he concurs both in the particular course of action which is recommended in paragraph 4 of those minutes in the event of a visit of the United States Vice-Consul at Bushire to Bahrain, and also in the general principles to be followed in dealing with the question of foreign consular representation in this region, which are enumerated in paragraph r of the minutes. ' 2, There are, however, two points to which T am to request you to invite Sir Samuel Hoare’s attention. While concurring in the view' expressed in paragraph 4 of the minutes that the United States Vice-Consul should not be allowed, even as a matter of courtesy, to perform any special acts in. his consular capacity, Sir J. Simon considers that in practice, even if the Vice-consul if allowed to oerform such acts on the express understanding that they are not to be regarded as done in his consular capacity, it may subsequently be found difficult to refute the The Under Secretary of State, India Office6. 3 ^ the contention thet they were in fact consular acts. It will, therefore, he better not to allow him to carry on any official activity whatever in Bahrain or ffoweit* 3, Secondly, in connexion with conclusion (d' in paragraph 5 of the minutes of the meeting, consideration has been given in this department to the question what measures would have to be taken in order to establish on a proner legal basis the services to be performed by British political officers for foreigners in the Arab States of the Persian &amp;ulf, supposing that, as postulated in conclusion (&amp;;, any foreign Power were not content with a general offer of the good offices of His Majesty’s Government and it became necessary to make some detailed arrangement on that subject with the Power in question* 4, Taking the different classes of consular services In order; the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction in so far as B- brain is concerned Ir already sufficiently provided for, in principle, by Article 8 (2) of the Bahrain Or der~in-Counci1• The position will be the same in Foweit, if and when the proposed revised Koweit Order-in-Council is issued. 5, As regards ordinary consular assistance and protection, the legalisation of documents and the registration of births, deaths and marriages, it will be sufficient if instructions are issued by the Secretary of State to the officers concerned empowering them to perform the services in question. The recognition, however, by foreign courts or authorities of any registers which may be opened under these instructions must of course depend upon the local law of the foreign country concerned*6* There remains the question of the celebration of marriages. Sir John Simon considers it undesirable that the Political Agents at Bahrein and rowsit should perform marriages between foreigners. The celebration of marriages by British officers is under the Foreign Marriage let and that Act only applies where one of the parties is a British subject. Although it may be legally possible to provide, by Order^in-Oouncil under the foreign Jurisdiction 'ct, for formalities of marriage for foreigners subject to British jurisdiction, Sir John Simon does not consider it necessary or desirable to endeavour to legislate specially for the purpose of marriages by these officers between foreigners, to whom the Bahrain (or Koweit) Order-in-Council applies. Xn the first place, it is doubtful whether, for instance, such s marriage celebrated by the Political Agent at Bahrain between two United States citizens would possess increased validity in United States law owing to provisions for such marriages having been made by Order-in-Counci1. Again, United States law, and indeed the laws of most countries, contain principles similar to the English common law marriage, under which marriages celebrated by a minister of religion or per verba de praesenti in countries where there is no local form available are recognised as valid. Since, therefore, in all probability no special legal provision by His Majesty’s Oovernment for such marriages would increase their validity in the eyes of foreign governments, it seems best to leave them to be celebrated in one of the forms referred to above. 7, Finally, as regards the registration of marriages, the3X{ the Secretary of State sees no objection to the Political Agent keeping a register for the marriage© of foreigners in Bahrein* in which he will record the particulars of marriages reported by the parties to have been celebrated between them and the manner of their celebration. Registration of this kind is merely a record of whet has taken place and is in no way a celebration of marriage. For* as stated in paragraph 4 above, would such a register add any validity to the marriage or purport to do so, but it might assist in the proof of a marriage if the question whether it had been celebrated arose at a later drte.

Sir, I have the honour to report that a rumour is current at Baghdad, and has been produced in the local press, includ ing the British owned 'Iraq Times 1 ’, to the effect that the ’Iraqi Government are intending to establish a Consulate for the Persian Gulf with headquarters at Bahrain. 2. I mentioned this rumour recently to the Director- General of the ’Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs and drew his attention to the special Treaty relations in which the Rulers of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf stand towards His Majesty's Government. I pointed out that one of the provisions in the Treaties in question was an undertaking on the part of the local Ruler that he would not consent to any other foreign Government establishing diplomatic or consular representation within his territory without the previous consent of His Majesty's Government. 3. The Director-General assured me that there was no foundation in the rumour and that the 'Iraqi Government had no intention of appointing a Consul for the Persian Gulf. 4 . i am sending a copy of this despatch to the political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire.

At the sarae time, the circunu tfuices in Bahrein are exceptional and before the United States Government decide fomally to approach us, we shall be glad if you will represent the following considerations to the state Department* '' ' : ^ Bahrein, like a number of other Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Oulf, is a British-protected State in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. In these Arab states the local ,a-ab ruler exercises jurisdiction oyer ids ovm subjects, and in some cases over other Arabs in Ids territory, but all other jurisell etion is exercised by His ‘Majesty*a Government through the British political Resident and. uue British Political Agent. fhe local Arab ruler, moreover, does not enter into relations with any foreign Power, We have hitherto mot permitted any foreign Consuls or other Government Agents to reside -in these /sxab States, and for many reasons we should not wish now to alter the attitude which we have consistently maintained on tide point. For instance, it is evident that, once a Consul irom one Power was admitted, claims by other Powers on most-favoured-nation grounds or otherwise would almost inevitably follow* It would be vexy difficult thereafter to refuse such requests from other Powers, in particular neighbouring .rab States, whose representatives could not be relied upon not to indulge jJH activities of a nature that idght be prejudicial to the interests/ Mr. H* Freeman Hatthe^vs, Chtirge d* Affaires, United States Babassy.I 2 ( I'V v:\. : 2 . interests of the oheikhs. Again, it would of course 'be necessary to make it clear, if a foreign consul, were appointed to reside in Bahrein, that he should deal exclusively with the British authorities and not with the Arab ruler, but there would always be a tendency on the pari; of the Arab ruler, *if a foreign Consul were to reside in his territory, to have dealings with him, especially if he were the consular representative of another Moslem or Arab State, Further, if a foreign consul were to be appointed, difficulties might arise over the question of jurisdiction, end it would be necessary to make it clear that he would not be entitled to exercise extra territorial jurisdiction over his nationals, and thus to remove them from the jurisdiction of the British Courts in the territory; we should not wish to give ary scope on the part of foreign Powers for advancing such claims. Quite apart therefore from the attitude of the Sheikh himself', (and we do not Inpw what view he would take on the question of principle,) His Majesty's Government would greatly prefer that there should for the present be no change in the existing arrangements ^whereby _ no representatives of other Governments reside in Bahrein* Phis system, we are convinced, has in the past greatly contributed to the maintenance of peace and good order. It has enabled the British representatives in tMs area to exercise their influence to the fullest extent, to compose internal and inter-state disputes, to ensure reasonably goocl Government, and to put down piracy and the slave trade. And the growth of American interests in Bahrein, to which you refer in your letter, entitles us, I tliink, to claim that the system has not in fact, any more than in intention, adversely affected the United jtates, fe therefore hope that the United States Government will be content not to press for an alteration in the existing arrangements, and you may be assured that we, for our part, will do our utmost to ensure that American interests, and the welfare of United States Nationals in Bahrein, shall not thereby be in any way prejudiced* (BIOSED) MAUilCE PETEHSdi, f .1/A-20 Telegram From India Office, London.

No comments (b) Are there any considerations^other than those advanced in the Foreign Office letter, which could be used to justify a refusal to meet the wishes of the Americans in this matter. tr EXPRESS LETTER The State Department ostensibly wish to open a Consulate at Bahrain because of the expected tf substantial increase in Aeimrican personnel as well as shipping at Bahrain.” If this increase takes place, it is not likely to be on a scale larger than occurred in 1936-37 when the Refinery was built. The following figures are taken from the quarterly statements prepared by BAPCO showing the nationality of their employeesx- 1-1-34 - 20 American citizens 1-1-35 - 24 h n 1-1-36 - 49 n 1-10-36 - 121 « tt (Statements between 1-10-36 and 1-10-37 cannot 1-10-37 traced) 146 American citizens 1-1-38 — 128 tt 1-1-39 — 91 tt « 1-1-40 - 67 it 1-1-41 — 55 « tt 1-1-42 — 34 n tt 1-1-43 - 32 ?t tt be I am not -sere that American interests suffered owing to ladk of consular representation in 1936-38. Moreover, the increase in American personnel now expected will be temporary, as it was in 1936-38. For construction work American engineers are admittedly necessary. But when the additions to the Refinery are completed^ the American construction gangs will leave Bahrain and only a f ew American citizens will be left - the minimum necessary to the efficdWA conduct of the Company* s operations (vide the Com pany* s obligation under Article XVII of the Lease Deed of 29th December 1934 - an obligation which has- 2 - been consistently honoured in recent years as the figures noted above testify). It would be most unfortunate if our interests and those of the Shai&amp;h were to be permanently injured in order to secure the temporary convenience of a handful of Americans employed by vfoat is, after all, a British Company (vide Article XIV of the Lease Deed of 29th December 1934)* A further point is that American economic interests in Bahrain will inevitably suffer if political stability is impaired. Political stability cannot be maintained if Iraq, Persia and Saudi Arabia are allowed diplomatic or consular r presentation in Bahrain. The 1941 census showed that, out of Bahrain’s total population of 89,970^ 15,930 were foreigner's. Of uhese foreigners less than 100 were Americans, It will be impossible to refuse to coun tries with so many of their nationals resident in Bahrain a privilege which is granted to the TJ.S.A. with only one or two hundred of its citizens resident here. As to American economic interests, they would be far better served by a continuance of the present politi cal stability than they would be by a consul who, in association with the British Political Agent, would be continually striving to counter the intrigues of agents of other powers. (c) (i) to what extent do the practical requirements of the situation justify the U.S. Government in putting for ward t is proposal, and (ii) is there any other way by which these requirements could be met. (i) An American Consul would have no functions to per form in respect of shipping. The issue of Navicerts and Certificates of Origin, approval of lists of passengers, approval of Manifests, the grant of Export Licences and other similar duties would continue to be performed by the Politi cal Agent. In r egard to American personnel on ships visit ing Bahrain, difficulty most commonly arises (a) if an American citizen commits a criminal offence and (b) if an American citizen falls sick. In respect of (a), no advantage would derive from the presence of n American Consul in | Bahrain as jurisdiction would, in any case, be exercised by the British Political Agent. In regard to (b) assistance is always given by BAPCO, and would continue to be given by the Company whether or not there wer s an American Consul l on the island. In regard to American citizens resident on the island difficulty arises respect of (a) solemnization of marria ges, (b) registration of births and deaths and (c) extension of visas or renewal of passports. (ii) The best method of meeting these requirements without compromising British interests 1m Bahrain is the appointment of an American Consul at Dhahran on the mainland of Saudi Arabia. Dhahran is the headquarters of a wholly American oil company and the number of Americans employed there is far greater than the number employed in Bahrain. There is a daily launch service between Bahrain and Al Khobar (only a few miles from Dhahran) and American citizens in Bahrain could be in constant touch with their Consul on the mainland. In case of emergency the existing radio tele phone service could be utilised if existing restrict ons on the use to which it is put were somewhat relaxed. If this via media does not satisfy the State Depart ment and if it becomes unavoidably necessary to make a3 s / further concession I suggest that there would be less objection to the appointment of n American employee of BAPCO as Honorary Consul with restricted consular powers than there would be to the appointment of a whole time consul with full consular powers. [ b: I : | (d) If the appointment of an American Consul is to be conceded* would it be possible to ensure in practice that his dealings should be exclusively with the British autho rities and not with the Kuler. Temporarily* and with the present Buler, Shaikh Salman, it would probably be possible to ensure t at the American Consul’s relations were exclu sively with the British authorities. It would be impossible, however, to ensure that this state of affairs continued in definitely, and a Buler^ would always be tempted to play off the American Consul against the British Political Agent. (e) What would the Shaikh's probable attitude be towards such an appointment. I cannot speak with certainty but I think that the Shaikh would rega d the appointment with approval as tending to emphasise the importance of Bahrain vis-a-vis other Arab Sheikhdoms. Though this would probably be his first reaction his attitude could no doubt be influen ced by other counsels. (f) Should the exequatur be issued by His Majesty's Government,which would obviously be preferable^ or by the Government of Bahrain. The extracts from the Bahrain Agree ments of 1880 and 1892 quoted in paragraph! 1 of Colonel Loch's letter to the Political Resident No. C/237 dated the 1st July 1933 seem to imply that, subject to the assent of the British Government, it is for thr Ruler of Bahrain to give his consent to the appointment of a foreign consul in Bahrain. I do not think,^however, the Shaikh would object to the exequatur being issued by His Majesty's Government provided, of course, that he were first consulted. p 4. In India Office telegram No. 7878 dated the 20th April 1943 reference is made to the embarrassment said to have been caused to the U.^.A. authorities by 'repeated severe criticism for not providing consular facilities'. It would be of value in answering the U. a .A. xds demand if we knew by whom the 'severe criticism' had been made and what particular consular facilities had Been found lacking. If this information were available it might well be found that the appointment of an American Consul or v ice Consul on the mainland would solve all difficulties. I should per haps add that the only criticisms I have heardfrom Americans about consular representation felate to the neces sity of permission being obtained f rom India for American employees of oil cdmpanies to take passages from Bahrain by air or by sea. This restriction is resented and Americans regard with disapproval the delay necessarily incurred in obtaining permission from India.

U.S. consulate at Bahrain. 2. Following are our views on points raised in India office demi-official letter Ho.KXT. 1468/43 dated 27th March. (a) .Ve agree with Prior that opposition to U.8. proposal should he pressed to utmost. For reasons v^hich will appear below we surmise that U.3. Government have other objectives in view beyond those which they have so far disclosed including possibly visions of oil and air hegemony along entire length of ^rab coast. (b) and (c). U.S. economic interests in Bahrain are represented exclusively by Bahrain Petroleum lomp&amp;ny• whatever may be ultimate origin of its resources by terms of Company’s lease as also of political agreement between Jompany and His Majesty*s Government this is a British company and its interests in Bahrain a&gt;re a British charge. (As practical point political ^ f !D9/ M-it /;/ agreement contemplated possibility of His Majesty*s Government taking over whole of works* plant and premises of Company in Bahrain). It would be impossible to countenance any attempt to displace British authority in respect of Company*s interests in / -5Ciingam ■MVHMHHMHIil Bahrain and indeed ?/e are not aware of any complaint that those interests have not hitherto been adequately safeguarded* (The outcome of negotiations for Bahrain Additional ^rea is itself sufficient evidence on this point}# as for personal interests of U*S. nationals figures supplied by Prior are illuminating end while we are not anxious to see establishment of U#S. consulate at Dhahran on Saudi mainland His Majesty’s Government will no doubt consider possibility oi attempting to divert U.B# attention to existence of purely American oil company there employing in normal times ten times as many U.B• nationals as there are in Bahrain. (d) Though it might, as Prior believes, be possible to ensure this with present duler there would obviously be room for constant friction and considerable temptation to present or future Shaikh to play off American CJonsul against iolitioal Agent. (e) We agree with Prior that Shaikh would be pleased at tribute in respect of importance but fuller under standing of implications would quickly bring him into opposition to proposal. (t) The appointment or reception of Goneul is not exclusively a function of full sovereignty but does we presume connote a standard of competence in external affaire to which Bahrain in view of the 1880 and 1892 Treaties, cannot aspire. In spite therefore of phrasing of second condition in latter Treaty we are of opinion that exequatur could only be issued by His Majesty’s Government. 3. With further reference to (b) above and to U*S. Embassy’s reference to their merchant vessels visiting Bahrain, we suggest that it be more fully emphasised that agrement to receive Gonaul of one nation in Bahrain would preclude refusal to other nations. It is relevant that in the three pre-war years German and Japanese shipping visiting Bahrain /3. » Bahrain greatly outnumbered American (77 German, 70 Japanese, 20 American}* It is not ? inconeeivable that proportion of other foreign shipping might be against U.S#A* after war and it is essential in our own interests (which in this respect are not dissimilar from those of U*S*A.) that nothing should be done which would leave Bahrain open to establishment of other foreign representation in post-war period. I.or, in view of British responsibility for protection of Shaikh's interests, can U.S.A. be permitted lightly to ignore argument that Middle Sast countries would equally claim consular representation if U.S. consulate were established. Figures quoted by Prior of ratio of American and other foreign residents in Bahrain provide valuable ammunition even though great majority are Persian and presumably Persia would not prejudice her claim by appointment of Consul. U.S. mobilisation of Shaikh's opposition to proposal may be of no great value, we suggest it is important that he should be informed of this proposal and be made to understand its implications by Resident or Political Agent immediately. U.S. Government have presumably not taken this initiative without prompting from oil interests concerned and it would ' ' • \ be unfortunate if Shaikh were to hear of it from\latter and express unguarded opinion without having fully understood all that is involved. \ \ \ with reference to Residency Printed Letter Bo.SBC-S dated 28th April 194 3. 4.

(E 1580/796/91) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 5th April, 1943. Dear Rumhold, In the last sentence (f) of your better of the 27th March to Caroe, about the proposal put forward by the State Department for the establishment of a United States Consul at Bahrain, you raised the question whether the exequatur should be issued by His Majesty’s Government or by the Government of Bahrain. Un this point, we are advised that when Consuls are appointed to Colonies, the formal exequatur is signed hy The King; the same applies to mandated territories, e.g. Palestine, and to Protected States like to Malay States, which are generally included in the districts of consular officers at Singapore i.e, a Colony. On the other hand, in the case of Transjordan there are two exequaturs, one signed by the King and the other by the Anir, In Zanzibar foreign consuls get (or used to get) an exequatur from The King and a be rat from the Sultan. If the United States Consul is to deal exclusively in Bahrain with the British Political authorities, it would be logical that he should only have one exequatur from The King. But the Transjordan and Zanzibar precedents may be useful if there is any difficulty about this and there is this also to be said for following these precedents, that the from the local ruler is an indication to the local subject that this consul must be regarded with respect because he enjoys the light of the local ruler's countenance. lours sincerely, H.M, Eyres. &lt;?- Ho•366-S• 3a. for H.A.Caccia.

Without knowing exact likelihood of appointment being made it is difficult to reply to your telegram. If there is any imminent danger that appointment may be made then I think Shaikh should certainly be warned of it. 2. I am not exaggerating when I say that such an appointment would almost inevitably lead to protect orate and it would not be honest to keep this from Shaikh who trusts us implicitly. Apart from Nejdi and Iraqi consuls (who would create an infinity of trouble) Persians would not be deterred by their claims from demanding a spokesman c.f. — (P- f Foreign telegram 3180-S of 22nd October 1929.

Ibn Saud later caused the United States Minister to be informed that he had no objection to the United States Government appointing a commercial agent, a firm or person comparable to the local British firm of Gellatly, Han key and Company but that he was not prepared to agree to consular representation at any place in his territories other than Jedda. 3. His Majesty' also stipulated that a commercial agent if appointed by the United States Government would have no authority to intervene in the relations between the Saudi Government and the California ;sxab ian Standard Oil Company. 4i .-x copy of this despatch has been sent to the Minister of State resident in Cairo.

American Consul for BAPCO * Question has been discussed with Wallace Murray during his visit here and he was persuaded with some difficulty to be content with visits from Consul at Dhahran. I must assume there would be no difficulty about arranging for an office to be placed at his disposal by Bahrain Oil Company on their premises and any necessary clerical assistance. It will no doubt be necessary to arrange for him to have radio-telephone facilities. 2. Immediate cause for State Department* s pressure in this matter lies in presence in Bapco of large number of American workers engaged in refinery construction and Wallace Murray is concerned that there should be (a) satisfactory police arrangements and (b) some arrangement for American participation on judicial side. 3. As to (a) it seems doubtful whether control by American Military Police will have been acceptable to U.S.A. War Depart ment and Murray suggested Oil Company might be able to furnish small number of civilian police. If not the State Department would wish to introduce some from elsewhere. While agreeing that assistance of American personnel would be desirable (as police officers under Regulation No.2 of 1939) I do not think we should accept position under which Political Agent would depend entirely on American personnel as his executive agents. /It2 It would presumably be equally unwise to depend on existing native police force for control of oxiotring American personnel and it would therefore appear desirable to bring in some British police personnel, say a superintendent and about half a dozen others, in order to maintain our position, I should be prepared to ask War Office to move PAIC to release personnel for this purpose in civilian capacity if no other source of supply, e.g. India, is available. 4, As to (b) Murray^ suggestion was that as a temporary expedient American Consul should be appointed to act jointly with Political Agent in his court for hearing of American cases. This could not be done under existing Bahrain Order- in-Council and further would imply American consular juris diction unless U.S.A. Consul sat on bench as a judge appointed by His Majesty’s Government and not os Consul. Presumably if American Consul chose to attend court ( mut. ) as observer and without any judicial functions there would be no objection to this though it probably would not fully meet Wallace Murray’s needs. Alternatively would it be practicable under Code of Civil Procedure as it is present applied for Political Agent to try such cases as Senior Judge with aid of American assess ors who might include the U.S.A. Consul if desired or suitable 4 members of the Oil Company. I should also like to be assured that Americans charged with offences will hove legal advise readily accessible to them. 5. I should be glad to have your views and those of the Government of India on these suggestions or any alternative suggestions for meeting of American desiderata. You will appreciate that as we hove gained our point over Consul it is important that we should go as far as possible to mod. wishes of Americans on these other points. Please treat matter as immediate os Wallace Murray has asked to be given our further views on it before his departure before the end of next w eek. RETAXANDUM*■*( f- H I ~ O'lio *■ Telegram S From To Political Agent, Bahrain Political Resident, Bushire No, cg- Dated 21st April 1944 IMMEDIATE / India Office telegram No,9211 dated April 21st, 2. Police arrangements. Eight special constables were appointed by me under Regulation No,2 of 1939 on February 8th (see my Printed letter No.0/302 February 9th) of whom four are British subjects and four Americans. These appointments were made after consultation with Chief Local Representative of Bapco and the Station Com mander specifically for the control of Bapco and B.M.P. employees, Station Commander has four British military policemen whose services are always available in case of trouble with Oil Company employees. 3, # Native police must not be relied upon and I 7 SfebiMxMi the idea of welcome/American military police unless they are picked men. Colonel Y/arburton Provost Marshal PAIC was recently here and after discussing the position with him I gather PAIC could increase their provost personnel and this would in my opinion be the best course. Provost personnel could if necessary be appointed special constables under Regulation 2 of 1939. Judicial . 4. Murray’s suggestion that American consul should be appoints* to act jointly with the Political Agent iu hearing American cases ■■' f • . \ \ is objectionable from both political and legal points of view. ,/ ^ Vi Political Agent’s lost of prestige would be very considerable / \ 't ■ \ ■ and in no time he would be sharing the bench with a Persian colleague. American consul can attend judicial proceeding here I / as he can anywhere else in the Empire and also act as juryman do not now or assessor /5&lt;1 £if 2, 5. Arrangements can be made for all cases in which Americans are accused to be investigated by a European magistrate as long as there is an Assistant Political Agent. Section 275 of the Criminal Procedure Code already allows for an American ffljagis&amp;xsi&amp;E majority on a jury and Section 284-A for American assessors and the Political Agent could be instructed not to invoke his section 30 powers in American cases. 6. There are no legal practitioners in Bahrain but such advice as I and my subordinates are able to give has never been and will never be withheld from British or American subjects. 7. In my opinion Murray’s concern over the presence of the refinery construction men is only an excuse. They will probably have completed their work by the end of the year. 8. I anticipate that Bapco can provide accommodation and clerical staff for the Consul but I cannot verify this without mentioning the subject to the Chief Local Representative which I have so far refrained from doing.

SUBJ; CT a American Vice-Consul, Dhahran. Sir, ^ 1 have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your endorsement No. Q/222 dated September 2nd 19^14. 2* Tfhen the question of the establishment of an American Consulate at Bahrain was opened in 1945 the United States / Government stated that their desire for the establishment x of a consulate was due firstly to their substantial economic interests at Bahrain and secondly to the severe criticism to which they had been subjected for net providing consular faci lities for their nationals in Bahrain and American ships calling at these Islands. In -April of this year the matter was still under discussion and the India Office stated in their telegram I 0 V'' No*9211 of the 21st of April that the immediate cause of th© State Department 1 s desire to extend their consular jurisdiction to Bahrain was the presence in the Bahrain Petroleum Company of a large nuxaber of American workmen engaged in the Refinery construction. Eventually it waa decided that an American Consulate should be opened at Dhahran in Saudi Arabia and that the consul should be permitted to visit Bahrain vdiich would be included within his jurisdiction on an informal basis. Thus i It will be seen that the clearly stated intention of the United States Government was to prevent inconvenience to their own citizens 5n Bahrain arising from difficulties alleged to be experienced in obtaining passport and other consular facilities, and to safeguard United States economic interests.\ 2. 3, Sine© the opening of the American Consulate at Phahran on the 2nd of September this year I have had several visits from Mr. Parker T. Hart the American Vice-Consul in charge.. Ho has from time to time raised with certain questions with regard to the grant of visas and travel facilities generally, and recently took up with me the question of Trade Marks and the safeguarding of patent rights in these Islands. Mi'. Hart on his more recent visits has shown a tendency to extend his interests and some days ago brought up the question of our refusal to sponsor an application from a Persian merchant resident in Bahrain for shipping space to import Anorloan ciga rettes. Mr* Hart’s attitude when raising this question was that ho was inter as tod in what appeared to amount to our dis couraging trade with the United States although ho m* de no speci fic statement to this effect* The papers on this subject,which consist of Mr, Hart’s latter No.610*1 dated the 8th October 1944 and my reply No. c/1522 dated the 29th October 1944, are enclosed as a perusal of these documents will explain the position* 4. On the 31st of October Mr* Hart called upon me and Informed ms that he had been instructed by the Ctate Department to enquire from me what objections there were to the importation into Bahrain of from seven hundred to one thousand Italian sub jects for artisan labour with the Bahrain Petroleum company and Messrs* Berchtel McCone Parsons Corporation Limited* On my expressing surprise at being so directly questioned on a subject which did not appear to me to lie within his purview Mr* Hart then informed me that he h-c already obtained a certain amount of information relating to this matter from the management of the Bahrain Petroleum Company* It seems that he had seen my letter No.C/1342 dated the 13th September 1914 in which, on your instructions, I had conveyed to the Chief Local Representative the information that His Highness was opposed to the importation of Italian labour for political reasons and that you were not prepared to press His Highness to change his view* Mr. Hart /asked3 * asked me point blank what the Shaikh’s political objections were. I explained to him that the question was under refer ence to yourself and to His Majesty’s Government and that I did not feel justified in imparting information to him with regard to a matter of this nature which had already passed out of my hands, but 1 could say that generally speaking he must realize that the people of Bahrain, and His Highness was no exception, like most Arabs had a deep-rooted objection to the Italians which probably had its origin in the Italian invasion of Libya prior to the Great War, that His Highness had a pair of Italian guns in front of his palace presented to him by His Ko/&lt;il Highness the Duke of Gloucester, and that the Italians had raided Bahrain dir ing the holy month of Ramadhan. Mr.Hart said that he regretted having caused me inconvenience but his instructions had been quite clear and the Department of st^te* was naturally interested in the work being done by the Oil Company with regard to 100 octane spirit anfl were anxious to accelerate the progress being made towards completion. I informed him that the Department of State were not alone in their interest in the production of 100 octane spirit and that His Majesty’s Government were also deeply concerned in this project and I felt sure were equally desirous of seeing it couple ted and in operation. 5* Later in the day I had some further conversation with Mr. Hart on this matter and he stated that he felt quite certaii that the Bahrain Petroleum Company were not really at alj anxious to bring Italian labour to Bahrain and that he himself considered that the difficulties which would have to be solved would by no means be compensated for by the problematical savin* of fifteen days in the time of completion of the project and that he was prepared to so report to his Government. Revertin* once more to our previous conversation he said that he hoped that I had not conceived the opinion that he was endeavouring /to\ to interfere In natters which did not concern him# I replied that my previous experience of foreign consuls was confined to Aden where both his own country and Italy were represented by consuls 'de carriere” and a number of other countries by the heads of local business houses and that cur dealings had been exclusively with regard to commercial matters, passport facilitbs, and certain legal considerations regarding nationality and questions arising between foreign shipping companies and the Aden Government# Never to my knowledge had the Aden Government been asked to explain its actions or to give reasons for any decision by the Consular representative of a foreign country, though it was not unusual for Consular representatives to be asked by their respective Governments to make discrete and confidential enquiries regarding subjects of interest# I suggested that as you were expected to return from India that very day he should MMBktake the opportunity of calling upon you and raising any question he might consider appropriate# Mr# Hart welcomed the idea but your delayed return has not so far made it practicable for him to see you* 6 # I find myself in some difficulta^rith regard to my manner of dealing with the American Vice-consul as I am bound on one side by the directions! received in India Office tele- gram No#13171 dated the 10th of June this year to do all in my power to ensure a smooth working of this somewhat peculiar system and on the other hand it would obviously be wrong of me to discuss with a representative, and a very junior repre sentative at that, of a foreign Government political matters which had already been referred to a considerably higher level. I feel that in this instance Mr# Hart was probably exceeding his instructions but whether that be so or not I would like to be informed regarding what attitude I should adopt should I again be subjected to an examination with regard to internal or external political subjects concerning our dealings with&lt;#♦. * HI. l/o. / Pw/cjrn S»-£a£a 3 i ga..SMylot sL &amp;&amp;?nUod gtataa ?f Awrlca. American Consulate, Dhahran. Saudi Arabia, 8th October, 1944* The Honorable Major Thomas Hickinbothaa, His Britannic Majesty^ Political Agent, Manama, Bahrein Is* Sir, Pursuant to the request which you made during our conversation of October 3rd, 1944, I am outlin ing the general terms of an inquiry received from the Department of State at Washington regarding applications for Essentiality Certificates allegedly filed by Mr. All H* Reza of Bahrein on behalf of the American firm Martin Brothers Tobacco Company, Incorporated* It is reported that applications for Release Certificates v/er® filed by Martin Brothers with the India Supply Mission at Washington, D.C. on .March 9th, April 4th, April lOtli and April 17th, 1944 In * order to obtain clearance for export to Mr. All R. Rasa, agent, of a shipment of twelve million American cigarettes, together with monthly orders of an additional ten million. The India Supply Mission’s reference numbers were IKD 14442, 14442-A, 15843, and 16211. The India Supply Mission acknowledged the applications, but informed Martin Brothers that the approval of tho Political Agent at Bahrein would be required, and that the applications liad accordingly been referred to India. This appeared to Martin Brothers to constitute a new requirement, as previously they had obtained Release Certificates without difficulty from the India Supply Mission for some five million cigarettes sent to Mr. Reza. Eventually Mr. Beza cabled his / principles ,principles that th© Essentiality Certificates would not ha granted* Martin Brothers has reported that steamship companies hi the llnited states have infomed then of the availability of sMpping space for a limited quantity of cigarettes, to be stowed in odd places on board after the loading of urgently needed bulk cargo. To verify the facts in the case and enable ae to reply to the Department’s inquiry, I would be grateful if you could indicate to :ae whether the afore-j&amp;ontlonad applications for Essentiality Certificates were referred to the Agency, as alleged, and if referred the reasons why Essentiality Certificates could not, in this in stance, be granted* Your assistance in tills matter will be much appreciated* Very truly yours, Sd./ Parser T* Hart American Vice Consul.Confidential . No. C/1522. n l O Political Agency, Bahrain, the 29th October, f 44. From: Tos The Political Agent, Bahrain . The American Vice-Consul, Bj^hrcuu Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No.SlO.I PTH/ cjijpi dated October 8th, 1944. 2. Up till October of this year Bahrain was allotted by the Government of India a total annual tonnage for imports from North America of 400 tons. Since October of this year an ad ditional 50 tons have been allotted making our total tonnage quota from North America 450 tons per annum. The procedure which has been laid down by the Government of India for the allotment of shipping space in the U.S.A. is as follows:- Local merchants make applications to the Political Agent who decided whether or not the import is justified and if he decides that it is justified the application is forwarded to the Hobble the Political Resident with the request that an allotment of shipping space be recommended. These recommendations are sent to the Government of India who in turn pass them to the India Purchasing Mission in the United States who presumably communicate with the proper local authorities with a view to obtaining the necessary shipping space. 3. In Bahrain it has been found that the applications received are invariably in excess of the tonnage quota and each application must therefore be carefully considered by the Director of Customs and the Political Agent with a view to ensuring that only the most necessary goods are imported. Special consideration is always given to whether or not the person making the / application ■■■■- 2 - application is an established importer of that particular line or not. * It should be noted that the Bahrain quota is for internal consumption and not for re-export. 4. Mr. Ali R. Reza applied on the 27th of April for an allot ment of tonnage for the import of twelve million cigarettes from the U.S.A. This application was carefully considered and in view of the fact that we had already recommended a previous applicatior for tonnage to cover a shipment of American cigarettes sufficient for our internal requirements and that tr. Ali R. Reza was not an established shipper of cigarettes he was told that his applicatioi could not be recommended. It is worthy of note at this stage that this individual had previously obtained cigarettes from the U.S.A. which arrived here marked r, R.E. ,f or re-export and there was reason to believe that he proposed to aiopt the same procedure with this present consignment and did not intend it to be imported into Bahrain for internal consumption* A further application lias been received from the individ ual concerned which will be considered with applications from othea local merchants who have previously not dealt in cigarettes from ■ the U.S.A. and should it be decided to alter the present procedure his application will receive due consideration.

In his inquiry regarding the importation of American cigarettes the American /ice Consul seems to have had some locus standi ; in that relating to the importation of Italian artisans he appears to have had none. 3. It is naturally not possible in the circumstances to lay down hard and fast instructions. While every endeavour should be made to ensure the smooth working of the system, reference to higher authority should be made in instances in which the American Consul appears to be exceeding his province, and if necessary, he should be informed that this is being done.

Hurt has lost little time in entering the political arena, and it is obvious that if his activities are not confined to natters strictly within his purview our whole position along this coast will be rapidly undermined, more especially as he has expressed . ^ P the desire vide my telegram No.T/884 of 22nd November to tour to Qatar, the Trucial Coast and Muscat* 3* We are extremely fortunate in that Mr* Hart has no knowledge of the Arab world, and he appears to have already antagonised Mr. Lloyd Hamilton, a Director of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, who regretted to Major Hlckinbotham that a more experienced and less uncouth person had not been selected to open the post • When he called on me (which he did in a shirt and trousers) IJr* Hart showed a desire to discuss the employment of Italian artisans by the Bahrain Petroleum Company, but said that he felt certain that the project would be abandoned* 4* So long as the United States are content to employ officers with these qualifications, the danger to our interests is minimised, though an intelligent man could secure very full details of local politics from the members of the Arabian Mission who are extremely well informed. His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, When The India Office, mm .-v fku - 2 - When, however, they are able to post officers with experience of the Middle East and a fluent knowledge of Arabic the position will become entirely different, 5, I have found it difficult to lay down more definite instructions for the guidance of the Political Agent as much depends on the method of approach adopted by the American Vice Consul. It seems, however, should he again attempt to intervene in questions of policy affecting the Bahrain Petroleum Company, that he should be informed that it is a British Company, and that their channel for dealing with local politics lies through the Chief Local Representative to the Political Agent. I should be glad to know whether you see any objection to this being done# I am sending a copy of this letter to the Government of India.

Telegram just received from Bahrain shows Shaikh has become more amenable and if Political Agent sees no objection I will instruct him as desired by you. 2 , No foreigners whether European or American have hitherto been allowed to visit Trucial Coast except missionary doctors. Only American subjects there are soldiers with whom Consul has no concern and their commercial interests are negligible. Moreover if we permit this visit it will be diffic ult to refuse Persian Consul in Basra who has over 10,000 ressirtissamts on Trucial Coast and might very well claim similar facilities. His Majesty*s Government may wish to consider this point before passing final orders. 3.

As Bahrein is informally within the jurisdiction of the vice-consul it must be expected that he will wish to fulfil the functions ordinarily carried out by Consular Officers, including the protection-of American nationals and commercial interests. The Vice-Consul should, of course, deal direct with H.M&lt;,Political Agent and not with the Sheikh, in view of the fact that act oh behalf ,of the Sheikh in regard to his foreign relations and since all foreigners are under British jurisdiction. Brlma facie , the Vice-Consul - to in the 3rd paragraph of the Political Agent's letter of the 2nd November. ■ - \ V perhaps natural that the State Department should wish to. inform itself of the difficulties in accelerating work of common importance to the war effort by asking their Vice- Consul to discuss the question at issue informally with the Political Agent, and in. a similar case K.il.G. would see no harm in his doing so again. Nevertheless, while the Political Agent need not refuse to allow the Vice-Consul to discuss would appear to have acted correctly in the matters referred 3. As regards the Bahrein Petroleum Company, it was unofficially with him questions affecting the Bahrein Petroleum The HOn'ble the Political Resident in the. Persian Gulf, The Residency, Bushire. ■/Company;■aaimm -2- Company , the Vice-Consul should not allowed to fur get .the three points: (a) that the Bahrein Petroleum Company .'is a •' -..British company? ’ (h) that under Clause 4 of the Political Agreement of June 29th 1940 between H.M.G. and the Company, a specific procedure is laid down regarding the Company's dealings with the Bahrein Coverrment . in connection with their lease -and regarding any ; other matters of direct concern to H.M.G,, and (c) that in all cases the Consul must never take up any. matter direct with the Sheikh but only .with the'Political Agent. L ' L; ' ... , 4 . ' E au.G. consider that all this might be’ explained •to the vice Consul in a frank and friendly manner, in order to ensure that he really understands the-position.

In general .K ,M.G.

The American Vice-Consul, Dhahran, Mr. William Sands, called on me on the 30th of April. He said that he had instructions from the state Department to re-iterate to me the statement made by his predecessor to my'predecessor viz. that -the state Department considered the Oil Company (Bapec) an American interest. Mr. Sands added that he assumed my ' reply would be the same as that given by my predecessor viz. that there vras also British interest in the Company since it ¥/as registered in Canada. I said that my reply v/as the same. i added that I thought it rather peculiar that it should be necessary for these statements to be exchanged between the local representatives of the two Governments. Mr. Sands said that he was merely making the re-iteration formally in order to comply with the instructions of the State Department. He did not tie up his statement with anything that was given before and indeed did not seem to*know it tied up or what was the necessity for making it. I remarked that it seemed rather like a formality being complied with 'in vacuo'. ■V&lt; LTelegram From To Repeated y la/20 &amp; 18/6. 8 (Pad). India Office, London. Government of India, New Delhi.

In virtue cf cur treaties with tiie rulers of Qatar and the Trucial Coast States, as well as with the Sheikh of Bahrain, the conduct of the forei^yi relations of those States is vested in us, and the Vice-Consul, therefore, should take all his official troubles to the Bolitlcal Agent or his representative and not to the local Rulers. We are asking the olitical Agent to provide such | travel facilities as may be possible, but the extent to I which he may be able to assist is somewhat limited in | the present circurastances and we hope, therefore, that ^ /theX ,''U ,6': Vice-CoRGuI Till ru t Q3Cpeot too ir.uch in this time, vi-ill gl&amp;dly do cur best for him. The United States interest in the Bahrain Oil Ccmoany is fully recognised. It is, however, a British caspsjrr and it is for us to 'protect* it.

I asked him if he had been pro moted to which he proudly replied that that was so. I congratulated him. He also gave me a P.P.G. card from Hr. Clarence Mclntoch, a Vice-Consul at Dhahran who, though I had not met him, I understand occasionally did visit Bahrein. 3. personally I had always been under the impression that His Majesty’s Government’s agreement had only been extended to a vice-consul’s functioning in Bahrein but on examination this does not appear to be the case. In fact, no definite statement seems to have been made, and the terms routine nature only which could be performed satisfactorily by a vice-consul. But I feel I cannot do so firstly for the above red son, and secondly because to do so would be bound to embitter our relations with the Americans in this area. 2. Parker T.

I enclose a packet of American propaganda material which I have obtained from the addressee, Sheikh Khalifah, the Superintendent of Bahrain police. I have not, made enquiries regarding other recipients, but in all probability similar packets have been addressed to the leading sheikhs of Bahrein and possibly also to merchants. There seeras no need to do so as the required action would appear to be to stop such distribution. 3. As regards the material itself it is in the usual American self-boosting style except in one instance in which the British Isles are shown on the same scale as the U.8.A. The result of this on the local mind is a belittlement of the British. To bring this about is, from the Bahrein angle, offensive, over and above which the distribution of American propaganda material in Bahrein does not come within the scope of the Consul's duties. Of course, we cannot stop the sending of literature through postal channels but these papers are brought either in the Consul's pouch and distributed for him by ARAMCO messengers, or they come in the ARAMCO bag and are distributed by ARAMCO. They cer tainly came in ARAMCO launches. 4. Hart may not have closely considered the matter and it may be that the distribution is made by his office without his knowledge. However that may be, I should endeavour to put an end to the distribution of this propaganda material and I think the best course for me is to speak to Hart and see what he has to say. I am absolutely sure that the general management of ARAMCO would not be willing partners to any act likely adversely to affect their communications between the mainland and Bahrein. if Hart's reactions are unfavourable I would again report to you. 5. I should be grateful for early instructions. Yours sincerely Sir Geoffrey prior, K.C.I.E leal Resident in the Persian Gulf B U SHIR E. mmmSECRET D.Q.No.109-S .

Dear Wilton, I enclose herewith a letter I have received from the American Consulate General in Dhahran for Shaikh Ali. 2, You will notice that the style highness* is used and not our customary Excellency* . I am taking up this point of* protocol. 3. You should make it clear that any reply should be sent through you. Yours sincerely, H.G. Jakins A.J.

Do you think it worth while pointing out to the American Con sulate General that the Shaikh of Qatar is an Excellency and not a Highness? p . # 3.

After Compliments, Your esteemed letter of September 15, 1949 has been to hand. We were pleased to hear that it had been decided that the name of you office should be M Consulate-General' as from September 7, 1949, for which information we thank you. Ysual Ending,Political Agency, Bahrain, October 9, 1949. Dear Wilton, The enclosure to your letter No.18/41/49 of October 4 arrived sealed, 2. I do not know if it was delivered to you sealed but if so would you note for future guidance that as under the treaty the foreign relations of Qatar are in our hands we cannot allow sealed let ters to pass between the Ruler and foreign repre sentatives . 3. It will also I think do no harm for Qataris to learn that it is impolite to seal a letter when forwarding it for delivery to a third person, 4. Actually of course the contents of this letter were quite innocuous. Yours sincerely, K.G. J&amp;kins No.C/Q-79. A.J. Wilton, Esq., Political Officer, Qatar, Doha,'SC.

G.L. b/2 P.A. \ -i n • Wr , The following action is to be taken in the event of an American Consular official visiting Bahrain and showing signs of consular activity. 1) . His attention should be drawn to the Exclusive Agreement of 1892 between the Shaikh of Bahrain and His Majesty’s Government. 2) . He should not be allowed to perform in his consular capacity any special act even as a matter of courtesy V C i N*; /&gt; 'M/L; rMonsieur Cassin came to say good-bye on the evening of the 27th May 1934. I mentioned his requests made through the Assistant Political Agent and said that no Proclamation had been issued in the case of the Gil Concession out it was merely an ordinary Agreement. Monsieur Cassin said that Mr.Davies said that he thought that there was a Proclamation. I said that there had not been one end that probably Mr. Davies did not know because he had only been out a short time. 2) . Similarly, according to Monsieur Cassin Mr. Davies had said that there would be no objection to his having a map, provideu that I had no objection* I to'U iionsieur Cassin that I had mentioned the thing to Mr. Skinner and that he had absolutely refused to give one of his maps. I \ n . IrC added that I rather surprised that they should/as oil companies were very strict in tne matter of their maps* Monsieur Gass in did not press the point and said, that tney had given him figures about the length of the pipe line and so on, and that he would have liked to have rounded off his report with a mao. 3) . I gave him the figures in the attached statement and said that I was afraid that they were not of very much use and that the bulk of the trade of Bahrain passed through India as a transit trade and that it would take a great deal of labour to separate out the various countries concerned. 4) . I understand that this is the last visit that Monsieur Cassin will pay before leaving his post, except that there is a chance that he may pay a flying visit for '12 hours' short! before he leaves. 5) . I think that it is necessary to go into this question of the French Consul at Bushire coming here as it is evidentl becoming more and more consular in effect.

In the case of every ship going out of the Gulf from here we have to approve^both^in quadrupli cate) ’(a) the list of passengers embarking h^^^am (b) the manifest of cargo loaded here; we are also in certain cases a. asked to give u Certificates of origin'* Also, if Bahrain is the ship’s last port of call (other than Dubai or Sharjah) before leaving the Gulf, we have to give it a Ship’s Navicert ’which involves in addition to (a) and (b) above, the scrutiny of lists of cargo loaded elsewhere and also all the previous passenger lists and certain other papers; if these are found in order, a Ship’s Navicert is then issued on the Ship’s manifest. (We have a rubber stamp for this). In addition, (1) a telegram is sent to the India Office informing them of the issue of every Ship’s Navicert and (2) a cor&gt;y of the manifest of every ship to which a Navicert has been issued is1 . ' is sent*to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. 2. iitirther formalities are necessary when oil or petroleum products are exported from Bahrain, as these cannot be exported without an export licence from us. Th4^% we give auto matically for Empire destinations; if for Egypt or for Portugese East Africa en route to South Africa, we have to inform the India Office by Express Letter; if for other non- Empire destinations, we have to obtain prior permission from the India Office by wire. 3. It is not so much the volume of labour— which except in the case of exports of oil is not considerable,— but the fact that ships seem to arrive here and require their TTavi- certs with uncanny regularity on Fridays that is troublesome. Apart from the above, our Consular functions in the case of American ships calling here are not likely to cause much work. Occasionally seamen are discharged here and are required to be sent home as ’’distressed seamen”, but in the case of American ships it is doubtful whether such cases would be referred to us. Other such items as the issue of Notes of Protests are likely to be rare U 7'^' // ■cr&gt; The American Vice-Consul Mr. William Sands called on h me on the 30th of April. He said that he ha^instructions from the State Department to re-iterate to me the statement made by his predecessor to my predecessor that the state / Department considered the Oil Company (Bapco) an American interest. Mr. Sands added that he assumed my reply would be the same as that given by my predecessor a**#- that there was also British interest in the Company since it was regis tered in Canada. I said that my reply was the same. I added that I thought it rather peculiar that it should be necessary for these statements to be exchanged between the local repre sentatives of the two Governments. Mr. Sands said that he was merely making,the re-iteration formally in order to comply with the instructions of the State Department. He did*not tie up his statement with anything that was given before and indeed did not seem to know how it tied up a***? what was the necessity- for making it. I remarked that it seemed rather &lt;v ' like formality being complied with 'in vacua'. /v 2* I should like to see the papers concerning this matter. C.C. I'llL (■ CK^XO - A 1.5.'45. V. O ’ h-. I have again been through these two files and can find no record that my predecessor received any communication, verbal pr otherwise, from the American Vice-Consul to the effect that the Bahrain Petroleum Company was an American interest. The previous C.C. reported to the same effect. Could C.C. please confirm or correct? ; .5. »45. Please see overleaf.. — - f-w- I can find no record of Mr. Hart’s alleged statement or Lajpi* Hickinbotham's alleged reply. Mr. Hart did however say that the State Department had a natural interest in Bahrain Petroleum Company's work on 100 octane spirit (see p.IBM and Major Hickinbotham'replied so had H.M.-G. The State Department were talking in 1943 of 'a substantial economic interest' in Bahrain (see p.35) and it is possible that Mr. O Hart, who seems to have been a rough and ready sort of person age, did not make his statement in the precise terms it was conveyed to him by the State Department. P.R's. suggestion (at p.140) that Mr. Hart be told 3APC0 was a British company was later endorsed by 1.0. (See p.156). 6/5/45. O c /db*t/0 • On a second reading of S.64 (p.168) it seems to me that the reason for Mr. Sands' 'reiteration' of Mr. Hart's alleged statement about BAPCO is the very evident doubt of the State Department that Mr. Hart ever delivered it. They only 'understand' that it was communicated to the P.A., and they do not go on to speak of the P.A.'s reply but that 'no indication has been received' of an understanding on this roint. The American interest in' BAPCO is trie primary issue in 3.64 where it is emphasised that H•M.a. recognised this interest as far back as June, 1944. Mr. Sands' visiu would seem to iiave been intended by the State Department ' to obviate misunderstanding between British and American officials 0 in the Persian Gulf area'.
