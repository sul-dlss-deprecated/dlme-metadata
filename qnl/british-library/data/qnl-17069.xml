He orders them to: (a) report the building of forts on the Arabian Coast, but not to interfere or investigate them and (b) to carry out examinations of vessels promptly and avoid delays, so that vessels do not have to be detained. He also authorises them to grant passes to those who apply and keep a register, but to refuse applicants who have clearly fitted out their boats for piratical purposes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024196567.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
