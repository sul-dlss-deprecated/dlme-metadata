It further mentions a threat the Customs Master has made in an attempt to prevent the Banian Luddoo from sending a representative to Muscat; it notes that the Resident should be able to sort out the situation in the event that the bugla carrying his representative is detained at Muscat.4 - Translated substance of a letter from Mehjee, a Hindu to Khojeh Hiskael, Agent at Muscat, dated 9 April 1851.The enclosure is stating that the goods belonging to Damordur ben Ludda have not been released by the Customs Master at Bunder Abbass, as promised by the Khojeh Hiskael.
