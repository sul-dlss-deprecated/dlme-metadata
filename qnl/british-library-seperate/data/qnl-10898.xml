The concession was granted in April 1898 by Sheikh Salim bin Sultan [Sālim bin Sulṭān Āl Qāsimī] while acting as Regent. On his return the ruling Sheikh, Sagar bin Khalid [Ṣaqr bin Khālid Āl Qasimī], saw nothing objectionable it. The concession was made to Hassan Samaiyah, his son Abdullah and Isa bin Adul Latif [‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Laṭīf], son of the Residency Agent at Sharjah. The concessionaires were described as British subjects and the interest in the concession of Herr Wonckhaus [Robert Wonckhaus] and Frank Clarke Strick is detailed. The memorandum also describes the claim of the Persian Government to Abu Musa and notes that the concession granted for five years to Frank Clarke Strick in January 1923 expired at the beginning of 1928 but there is nothing to show that any application was made for a renewal.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Frank C Strick and Company Limited, shipping company</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Robert Wönckhaus and Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight John Gilbert Laithwaite</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Hassan bin Samaiyeh</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Saqr bin Khālid Āl Qasimī</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sālim bin Sulṭān Āl Qasimī</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Abu Musa Island</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Mineral resources</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, red oxide, Abu Musa</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000035#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
