Here, as we ended the Old Year, fo we began the New with a defire of profecuting our intended .Voyage: But a South-Weft Wind prevented our Courfe, and held us there Three Weeks; when an Eaft Wind made a general delivery and a clear/&gt;uw. Being at Sea, we made eafy Sail, that our Ships might have the liberty that Night to finglexhemfelvesfrom the Crowd of the other Ships; notwithstanding which Provifd, we had a fhrewd Sufpicion; for Night haftening on (and in fuch a fwarm of Veflcls of greater bulk, not fo readily manageable as fmaller) w 7 e beheld three Lights out of the Poop of a goodly Ship, the fame unfortunate (igns our Diredions bound us to take notice of; which made us conclude the Damage on our fide, as indeed it proved by the next Morning- fong; for having caft our Eyes abroad to look what Ships we had in company, running over a great many (that had fhrowded them- felves under our Protection and of Six Men of War more, Captain Commander in chief (whereof Two were Firefhips) fent for to meet the Eaft India Fleet at Sanfta Helena , for their better Defence homeward-bound, and to prevent their falling into the Ene mies Hands, who had lately poflefled themfelves of that Ifland) we at length miffed the Majftnherg, on whom (it feems} a fmall Pink falling foul, had carried away her Head and Boltfprit, and 'tis to be feared has difabled her this Voyage; we law her afterwards make for Portfmuth. Off the Land's End we met with Four Englifh Merchant Ships, Two French Men of War their Convoys, laden from Cales. bound for London. In Four Days, from the Downs, we were lofing* England on our Backs, reckoning the Lizzard the moft extreme part South to bear North and By Ea(t 14 Leagues 5 from whence hereafter we were to retch our Meridian Dijlance : It lies in the Latitude of co deg. 10 mm.

We flill directed . our Courfe South, and in Twenty four Hours ran One hundred and feventeen Miles by our Log-board for fome days together, the Wca- Little credit ther not allowing us to obferve with the Quadrant; but as foon as tobe 8 iv ento we could take the Suns Altitude, we found our felves to be in the inrefp^of 1 Latitude of 36 deg. 2 rain.

Weft ^ theShipsway. an hundred Miles in four Days more than we judged our felves to be j which futficiently proves the little credit to be given to the for mer way ot reckoning. The following day maintaining the fame Courfe, we pad by the Mouth of the Streights of Gihrgltar, one of Hercules $ Pillars^ the Hercule s \ Pfi- fartheft Point South of zWEurope, ^ Jar - Here we began to drop the refl: of our Company, fome (biking Weioft our Eafi for the StreightSy others Weft for the Canaries^ Firginia, &amp;c.

An hour more being hardly run, we in like manner made the Madera Ifland, the largefl of the whole The ifland of Atlantkk , being South-Baft fome twelve Leagues, too great a di- Madera^ the fiance to take a perfed Landfchap, it being only difcernible to Ire ^hntldoZ Land , and confirmed to be fo by this days Obfervation, which an. ' ' ce ' was 3 ] deg. 17 min. to the Northward of the Equator , in Latitude and Longitude from the Lizzard as before, we having neither raifed nor deprefled it. Where the Trade-winds begin to offer themfelves, the Mariner relaxes his anxious care of Sailing, and is at more lei- fure to Repofe; he not being fo often called upon to fhift his Courfe, or hand his Sails; vfrhich has yet this inconvenience, giving him leave now to fall into thofe Diftempers Idlenefs contracts, viz, the Scurvy , and other ill Habits; unlefs rouzed by an Adive Com mander, either to Sports, or more ufeful Employments : Although the perfed: knowledge of thefe Trade-winds (which are more con- flant within the Tropicks) are of fuch importance as to make our Modern Navigators perform that in fix Months, which took up the Pains and Travels of as many Years from the firfl Difcoverers^ they keeping all along the Shore, whereupon they became not only liable to unaccountable Changes, as they met with Landbriezes, The adnn- Head-lands, or Contrary Winds; but were many times difappointed tageofunder- either to go on, or return, by the feveral Accidents they encountered Trad^wbds thereupon; which thefe more, experienced and bold Adventurers sndthe^si- by (landing off to Sea, and fludy of their Compafs by a more accu- mut^l • rate Computation of their Way by the Quadrant and Azimuth, and a flrid enquiry of the commencing and terminating of thefe Winds, avoid. In this fhort fpace we have almofl outran the Northern Winters Blafts, and begin to be fenfible of a more vigorous Clime, whofe temperate Warmth adds Spirits to our frozen Limbs: Yet in this forward Spring ( for fuch it feemeql to us) we cannot efcape fome Lafhes of that cold Nemejis; for Night being come, ihe fends a Storm of Rain and Hail with an high and bleak Wind, in which B 2 appeared4 A Twelve MonVyage , T fhp Sailors Deities, Ca/ltr and Po/Zux, or the fame it may ^ Kve light to thole Fables, they boding lair Weather to Seamen, T^or h never feen but in Storms looking like a Candle in a dark caftor and pti- i u orn 0 f which there were divers here and there above the Sails and Shrowds, being the of the Watery Element, by the Pormals chrianed Querpo Santos, the Bodies of Saints, which by thf-m are efteemed Ominous.

We holding on flill South, the frequent Noife of Thunder, the fultry Rains, quiet Seas in refpedt of what we had before, were aflured tokens of our drawing nigher to that Fountain of Heat, the Sun, By reafon whereof it was familiar to behold, the fportful Fidies greedy of their Prey raife whole Flocks of that Scaly Nation.

The Mouth of one of them extended, is two Spans wide, armed within with three Tire of lharp pointed Teeth on both Jaws, fo piercing that Needles exceed them not, and of fuch flrength that a Leg or an Arm, Bone and all, is but an eafy Morfel; wherefore called Sharks by the Seamen, on whom they are bold enough to faften, and difmember if not fhunned when they wafh themfelves: They are of a rank fmell, and not good to eat but by flout Stomachs; of Length they are ten, fometimes fourteen Feet.

Before us in a Valley was a moft llately Grove of Cocoes and ^ r ^ ely Oranges (through which ran the Scream our Men filled their Casks rov * with Water) furrounded with a Wall. The firft of which Trees, fo much celebrated for its ufefulnefs, deferves as much for the pleafure it affords the Sight. It grows with an upright, tall, and (lender Body, the Bark of an Afli colour, lori- cated; not fending any Branches forth till it come to its chiefeft Summit, where it fpreads its fhady Branches with fome refemblance to our Ofmond Ro) al Fern, but more like the Palm; and under thefe ^ e ^ e ,^ ocoe protects its weighty Fruit; which hang very thick round about the beautyVnd Tree,to which it y ields but one Stalk, but that fit to fupport its ponde- ufefulnefs, roufnefs ; every Moon produces a frelh Harveft both of Fruit and Boughs; the firft being gathered, the others being thruft off when faplefs by the young ones: If the Juicy ones be wounded, there diftills an heady Liquor, which they preferve in Earthen Pots fitted to re ceive it, but that fpoils their bearing Nuts. Next to the Stalk it be llows a CaliX, not differing (only in bignefs, and that it is fmoother) from that of our Acorn; from which proceeds the Rind of a lighter Green, under which a fibrous fubftance prefents its felf, which might fupply them with Utenfils, for Roaps and Sails; beneath which ap pears a fpacious brown Shell; proper for many Neceflaries, big enough for a Drinking Cup, a Ladle, and many more; ferving them for the chief part of their Houflioldftuff: Enclofed in this is a deli cious Meat, white in Colour, cloathed with a pithy matter, as our Hafle -nuts, and notinferiour to them in Tafte ; this they chufe for their ordinary Nourifliment. Nor does it afford them a lefs grateful emulfion, contained in the Nut to the quantity of a Pint, or Pint and half; in colour like Whey, and of that confiftency, but in re- liih far excelling. When the Meat of the Nut grows rancid, they exprefs an Oyl ferviceable for their Lamps. Thus abundantly has Providence furnifhed them from this one Root. The figure of the Fruit, take it intire, is oval, and as big as the largeft Melons.

This toffing Condition lafted long, and w^as taken kindly too, as long as we fpooned before the Sea, and kept from running foul of one the other ; but when a Fret of Wind rowled the Waves athwart our Quarters, it made our Ship fhake, proving the found- nefs of her Sides, where had fhe given way never fo little, we muft have funk without Bail or Mainprize. Still theTempeft encreafes, and brings with it Gufts of Rain and difmal darkfome Weather, whereby we were feparated from the reft of our Fleet: For all, we put our Lights abroad as did they, yet in the badnefs of the Night we loft them, and were left alone to fliift with the boifterous Winds.. ^ t • At laft the Morn appears, but with the Symptoms of a blowing Day. She had not wafted many Hours, but on the advantage of a rifing Wave, we fpied a Sail to Leeward with her Fore-top-maft by theBor.rd, which at Neon we knew to be the Cafar crowding under all its Sails. In this Encounter we fliipped many a perilous Sea, ( not with out -being well-drenched our felves): Such was the force of this Nights Storm, that our Boat, and fome of our Men, were not without difficulty reftrained from being carried over-board. In this pickle we reeled out this Day, and out-ftretching the Ctefar, we made what Sail wedurft, and by the next Light had fight of our Fleef, who Ihortning Sail, we came up with them, to whom we declared the misfortune of the C&amp;far, and that it bore South' IVefi; wherefore they lay by, (the Wind llackning) and in half an hour wefaw the Hull, and prefently after it made up our Company compleat again. , Near the middle of this Month we could have made that known Cape, the Cape of Good Hope, being in the Latitude of 36deg. 14 min.

The firft care then was to fend the Sick Men afhore, which it is incredible to relate how ftrangely they revived in fo ftiort a time, by feeding on Oranges and Frefii Limes, and the very fmell of the Earth; for thofe that were carried from the Ships in Cradles, and Jooked upon as defperate, in a days time could take up their Beds and walk; only minding to fetch them anights, that the Mifty Vapours might not hinder the kind Operation begun on their tainted Mafsof Blood, by thefe Specifick Medicines of Nature's own preparing. We had Leifure now joined to Security of the Dutch, for thit no Ships from Indii can readily return this way into Europe at this time of the Year; and Hollander after having touched at the Cape, ufually go firft to Batavia, before they coail India; which gave us free leave to dedicate our felves to all the Pleafure this Place could afford; which for its Excellencies may deferve to be called Happy, as well as any the Ancients beftowed the Name of For tunate, Macariaox Fxlix on.

Towns fome few they are Mafters of, but for Sumptuous Fabricks none will be found here. Their Chiefeft Town bears the Name of the Ifland, which is feated Town along the Strand, under an high Hill; on one fide refrefhed with a aridBuildln g s ' gentle gliding Stream &gt; on the other fide recreated with a fine Plain, prodigal of its Fertility. The Town it felf is to look on, an heap of Ruins, nothing remaining but the Marks of former Induftry (pro bably the Portugals ) here being left Walls of an huge thicknefs, compofed of Stone, and cemented with Lime :• To every Houfe a Portal, but miferably defaced with Age; the Planks of their Doors fewed together, their Buildings not exceeding one Story ; againft thefe, Lazinefs has fuggefted them to lean their Flaggy Manfions : Flags efpecially in their Villages (by them called Cajans, being Co- Coe-tree Branches) upheld with fome few Sticks, fupplying both Sides and Covering to their Cottages. They commonly order their Model fo, as to make a Quadrangle with only one Entrance, all the reft being clofed outwards without any Windows ; in which every Houfe of Note on the Right-hand has a fhady Contrivance, like the Walks to our Tennis-Courts, but not fo long; on the upper end of which fits the Mafter of the Family on a Bed of Rattans, a, kind of - Cane: Here he, with the Steward of his Houfe, are obferved by his Slaves (who ftand aloof) to fpend the heat of the day. Among thefe, but at fome remotenefs from any of their Dwel- Two Mofyuti, lings, are two Mofques, or places for Devotion, built after the manner of our Churches (but for Magnificence much like their other Strudures) with Ifles and Naves walled up to the very top; within 1 them only a place left for entrance at the Weft end. They are de cently Matted on the Floor, though not hung fomuch as with a Cobweb on the Walls; which they keep (and in that to be com mended ) very clean. In the Piatzos ( for fuch their Porches had ) ftands on the Right-hand a fquare Stone Ciftern, full of Water j and the whole without any Doors always open. The Nobler of the Two has at the Weft-end a round Tower , not very high 5 to this like- wife belongs a more fpacious Yard, filled with Tombs reared Mans heighth, covering them with a falling Ledge atop, leaving open a D Port* .,g A Twel Letter I.

The King's Having given you the Description thus far, I muft crave leave Cciut. f or Error, in not giving it the Style of Regal before now : For it proves to be the Seat of one of their Kings, which I had almoft forgot, had not my greedy Eye efpied a Houfe more eminently feated, and more decently covered than the reft, but the Materials not much different; only they have allotted him a little more Air ' to breath forth his fwelling Title, King of Johannah Town, Where fore after a fmall Enquiry, it was manifeft it was the Palace Royal; nor did I much doiibt it, after we had gained admitfion ; where did fit the King in (late, at the upper end of fuch a Place as before was taken notice of, on a Cott, or Bed, ftrewed with a Quilt. On a Bench at each Elbow were placed two of his Nobles by him: We being introduced, inftead of Killing his Majefty's Hand, he took us . one after another mod gracioufly by the Fift, and by the Mouth of his Interpreter pronounced us heartily welcome, and bad us take our Seats according to our Qaalities; whichjafter we had put our Hats on, we did ,• and the Interpreter with great Refpe&lt;5i: took his on the Floor crouching in the midft of us. In this manner, without Ihew of dread or fear of being mifconftrued, we talked freely of matters re lating to both our States; as he firft examining if we had any Gun powder or Compafs-Glafles to fpare him ? We feconded his Demands with what regarded Provifions for our Voyage; for whichLicenfe our Captains are obliged to make him Prefehts of Scarlet-cloth, and other Europe Rarities, that they may unmolefted buy the Bullocks, Cows, Goats and Hens of his Subjedfo. Both being at length out of Difcourfe, or not very well underftanding one another, hefpeaking Arahkk, we as good Englijh as w 7 e could ; we had liberty in this in terval to furyey the Gorgeoufnefs of his Attire. On his Head he wore a large White Turbat, and had as good a White Shirt on his Back; from his Girdle halt way his Legs, a Blue Silk Veft fringed with Purple, without Shooes or Stockins to his Feet, which he often puHing up into his Cott or Couch, would fmilingly crofs them, and with his Nails claw ofT the Dirt.

What Towns they have of Note we could not learn; but Towns they have , if not Cities , within the Country. And certain it is, their Chief Governour is an Aralian Lord. •This Johanna Town is about Three quarters of a Mile in length, and may contain Two hundred Houfes; their Streets being no broader than our Allies. Villages are very thick, and Cottages difperft in every place. Every Valley makes a delightful Grove, one of which exceeding all the reft , was cooled with two dainty Currents, decked with a continual Spring, charming the Senfes with the real Sweets of any the moft exquifitely feigned Paradifes; to fee Limes grow on Shrubs, Leafed and Thorned like our Crabs, Oranges, (ot which there is a pleafing fort, though fmall, not giving place to our China ones ) tempting the Sight from a more exalted, and lefs fufpicious Tree. Over which the lofty Cocoes with unparallei'd ftraitnefs ftretch forth their Boughs, difpofed in Ranks, as if ordered by the Skilful- left Planter. Lower than thefe, but with a Leaf far broader, ftands the Curi ous Plantan, loading its tender Body with a Fruit, whofe Clufters emulate the Grapes of CanaanjMhich burthened two Mens Shoulders; below which, an odoriferous Plant feizes the Smell 5 and winding through its fubtile Meanders, revives the Faculties of the Brain: Here the flourilliing Papaw (in Tafte like our Melons, and as big^ but growing on a Tree leafed like our Fig-tree), Citrons, Limons, and many more, contend to indulge the Tafte; the warbling Birds the Ear; and all things, as if that general Curfe were exempted, ftrive to gratify the Life of Man. Neither has Nature fo played the Wanton here, as to be unmind ful of the Afcending Hills, which in other places by chance are pro ductive, but here they abound, and liberally beftow on the humble Valleys: Notwithftanding the Clime it is fituate under,.bears the reproach of that uninhabitable Zone; yet that Afperfion is blown off by thofe admirably tempered Breizes of the Mountains. The Inhabitants are black, though not fo black as at St. /ago, as well Limb'd, and as well Featured ; neither fo tall, nor fo proud as they, but more honeft : Whether out of fear of Punifliment, or na tural Integrit) 7 , may be left to conjedure ; For our Fleet lying as now at an Anchor, fome years pafled, they filched fome flight things from the Eng///fr ; as likewife fome Sailers from them ; the Grievances on both fides known, and the Parties detected.

Thus had they raifed it to the capacity of Thirty Tuns: When it will be finilhed, at the rate they work, will be hard to guefs. They are Owners of feveral fmall Provoes, of the fame make, and Canoofes, cut out of one intire piece of Wood; poifed with Booms to keep them from over-fetting ; in thefe they paddle with broad Sticks, not row as we with Oars. They are very adive at Climbing, Running like Jackanapes up their Cocoe-nut Trees, which they do by twitting a Band to keep clofe their Feet, as they raife their Bodies by their Arms grafped about the Trees. They are not folicitous for much to cover them, only a Clout to hide their fhame, truft with a String round about their Waifls, in which they ftick their Knives, in a readinefs to cut down their Food from the Trees. Their Slaves have a dejeded Countenance, diftinguiflied by bore- ing their Ears: They fit on Stones, or low Seats, their Arms folded like Monkies. However, they are not fo abjed, but that they have the ufe of Letters, and fome fcience in Aftrology, by what I can teftify: For walking the Country, and almoft tired, I«ftept into an Houfe, where I faw a Man writing with a Pen made of a Cane, in the bottom of a Bowl befmeared over with black; confidering a-while, at length I obferved he made Arabian Charaders, and aimed to draw a Scheme, which when he had done, he poured Water upon, and ftirring it round with his Finger, wiped it out again, and as he did this, mut tered ferioufly tohimfelf, doing fo thrice.

With fourteen Sail of Ships they roved on the Coafis of Malahar and ar lafl: came to the Iflind Ce'tlon, fetting upon the Dutch at Trin- comala't, and forced it; but being deftirute of Provifions forfook it, alter the iofs of abundance of their Men, and four of thdr Ships.

IT is a City that formerly for Riches, Pride, and Luxury, was fe- Hiftotyof cond to none in India; but fince, by the mutability of Fortune, ^ it has abated much of its adored Excellencies. The Sea on one fide greets its Marble Wails, on the other a Chain of Hills intercepts the Violence of the inflaming Heat; one of which, called St. Thomas his Mount, is famous for his Sepulture, (in Honour of whom a Chappel is dedicated, the Head Prieft of which was once the Metropolitan Bifhop of India') , and for a Tree called Arhor Triftis, which withers in the Day, and bloflbms in the Night. About this Mount live a Caft of People, one of whofe Legs are as St. Umas big as an Elephant's ; which gives occafion for the divulging it to L n lans ' be a Judgment on them, as the Generation of the Aflaflins and Mur- therers of the Blefled Apoflle Si. Thomas, one of whom I faw at Fort St. George. Within the Walls feven Churches anfwer to as many Gates; the Rubbifhof whofe (lupendious Heaps do juftify the truth of what is predicated in relation to its prifline State. The Builders of it were the Portugals. The Confounders the Moors, who furprized them wallowing in their Wealth and Wantonnefs. The prefent Competitors are the French, who are very unlikely to keep it (not for want of Valour, but for that few and unprovided, are not able long to refift multitudes) the Moors, and thirdly, the Hollanders, whofe Interefts are to deftroy the French in India ; Which the French forefeeing, had wifely folicited a Truce with Gulconda, and had hopes of that King's complying, till the Arrival of the Dutch) when they could not be heard. For confidering a Kindnefs extorted not lb obliging as that freely offered, and his Honour at tainted by their Swords being ftill in their hands, he clofed with the Hatred of the Hollanders, for their final Extirpation. Before which be accomplifhed, he may chance to find it an hard Task, efpecially had the French any hopes of Succours* For now they are 6co ftrong in the Fort and Ships, all flout Fellows, every Soldier fit to be a Commander. Their greatefl: fcarcity will be of Food, with w hie If 'had not the Englt[h privately befriended them, they could not have fubfifted hitherto. Though the Englijh, fhould they have War with France, would find them to be an Annoyance to their Trade : So that were the City again in the hands of ths Moors, or even with the Ground, it were better for us. Here it may be queried. Why Gulconda being a Potent Prince, KJng of g«/- fliould permit Garifons to be in the hands of Aliens ? To this may be weak at anfwered, That this of Sr. Thomas was founded when the Indians were naked ,and unarm'd. But this fatisfies not the Queftion, fince that the Moors having conquered it, they again offered it the FortU' gals, who flighted the Propofitions, unlefs they would.reftore them ' their Guns which they carried away with them. The true reafon then is this, That Gulconda, as all the Indian Princes are, is weak at G % Sea; - 1 ;aaA Twelve Mon Sea • therefore it is a Maxim among them to commit their Strong holds on the Sea -Coafts to thofe they can call their Friends, for not only preventing Invafions at the Charge and Courage of Foreigners; but' they (not being Abfolute, but fubjcd: to the Authority of the Great Mogul) upon any Defeat, have thefe Places as fure Afylums of Retreat. ^ _ Amidft thefe Scenes of Atturs, what next otters to our View, is odd in it felf, To find an Aptnefs in thefe People to improve all Gain ful Arts, anc ^ not t0 ^ ave a d v a ncc d one footftep from the falie Ru-. diments 'either of Religion or Culloms of the Old World ; for they do in my mind more than imitate, pertinacioufly holding their Anti quities of Pan, Ceres, and Flora; as may appear by this and other following Farces. Towards the latter end of Augufl, when their Corn was in the Blade, and they uere expedlring a plentiful Crop, ihzGentuesuiMa- deras held a Feaftin Memory of fome of their Saints of the Devil's canonizing. Their Ceremonies were ufher'd in with Tumult; in the middle of them were carried their Gods inState, garnifhed with the Richesof the Orient ; they were cut in horrid Shapes; thereafon of which, Divina affimulatio eft caufa diver fit at is in rehus ; though Uhould al- low the diverfity of Creatures in all Orders of the World, hath no other aim but to reprefent the Divinity , by whatfoever Image, yet I cannot imagine fuch Deformities could ever be invented tor that end. Before them went the Brachmins % making a Noifewith their loud Mufick; after them their dancing Wenches ( who always Morning and Evening tumble afore their Gods, which vvithfome Mimical Gefture is all their Dancing ) with Ephods of Silk and Gold upon their Breads: With thefe in a Ring hand in hand, were the dancing Boys, all naked but a Clout about their Privities, like the Bacchanalian Youths that ufed to revel it with Floras Sirura- pets through the Streets of Rome. Thus wenp they in Proceffion, till they came tea Pageant, where on was pictured their Gods ; from whence, over a crofs Piece of Timber, hung a Cocoa Nat, which the Hinds.in Yellow Caps, and Clouts about their Wafles, driving to hit with a great Club, are waflied by a Shower ot Water, by tlie Brachmins placed on purpofe; aher a long Xrialof their Patience, they luffer one.to bear it away in Triumph. ■ | •&lt; All the, time of their Sport, Beetle and Cccoa*£Iuts are fcatcered among the People, for which they Icramble as earneflly as if they were Medals at Coronations.

Then fetting open the Gates of the Pagod, they received all the unfandiified Crew, and Ihut them in; where how they conclude their Rites, is not to be divulged, Ignorance with them being the Mother of Devotion. .

At the end of Augufl one of the Portugal Junks, we found in the Road, fet Sail for Achein ; where is Gold, and the Ifland thought by fbme to be Solomons Ophir; and the Queen thereof, by whom it is conflantly governed, confidently reported to be the Queen of the South, Achein being on the Ifland Sumatra in the South Seas. The firft of September only Seven of our Ten Ships returned from Mechlapatan , with their wounded Men and torn Hulks, who had. met the Hollanders, and tried their Force ; two days after they were difpatched from Mechlapatan, in Petti poke Bay, where as foon as Day began to peep, a Thicket of Twenty^ail of our Enemies were difcovered (lemming the flowing Tide at an' Anchor. Our Fleet might have pafled them without giving Battel; but that the un daunted Britains fcorned to fly, chufing rather to lye a Battery for them, than cowardly to flinch : Whereiore they braced their Sails to the Mafls,and being to Leeward,flayed for the Wind which favoured the Hollanders \ who coming up with our Fleet, made as if they would have gone by them *, but were intercepted by the headmoft of ours: Which perceived by the forwardefl: of theirs, they fenr their Shallops aboard their Admiral for Orders, for vis conjilii expers mole ruit /4Strength void ot Counfel finks with its proper weight; which was but too truly the fault of our Commanders, over-confident'of their own Condud:, and lightly regarding the Authority of their Ge neral.

Therefore on thefe Coafls the South Winds blow for Eight Months, fonr of which are May, June, July , Augufl. Then the Sun is fo llrong, that it would be uninhabitable, did not there fall at Night thofe Vapours which the Sun draws up in the Day; and by decli ning of his exorbitant Heat, leaves them to be condenlated at Night; when the Air is more grofsj, and the Earth is cooled either by thick Mills, or a more palpable Moifture (which you may call pouring Showres} arid thereby made fertile, which otherwife would be in- fupportable and barren. That which makes this the more plaufible is, That the Afiatick India intrafiangem, is a Pene hjfula i and the Seas lie near round the Land. But about the Sun's retiring to his Southern Tropick, the Winds take their Northern Courfe, the Rains do ceafe, and the Sea alters its Current ;:o the South, when by the innate coldnefs of thefe Blafts the Clime becomes more habitable, unlefs where the Sands caufe a reflexion of heat, as at Mechlapatan; where they keep clofe all Day for three or four Months together, (though then the North Wind begins to abate its impetuouty, and the South Winds prevail) repel ling the Heat by a courfe wet Cloath, continually hanging before their Chamber-windows; which not only refids the Ambient Air, but by'the afflux of Nitrous Particles from within, does caft a Chil* nefs over rm Room ; without which, the Walls, that for that in tent are plaftered, would be fo hot, yoir could not abide your Hand on them ; the fame way they have of cooling their Liquors, fcy .a wet Cloth wrapped about their Gurgulets and Jars, which are Vef- fels made of a porous kind of Earth ; th^beft of Mtecha, reafonable good from wa, which are carried with them in this' nature where- everthey travel. Before we difmifs this Difcourfe, it may be noted. That the Rains on this Con ft are more intermitting than on the Malabar .Coaft, fo that they can loofe hence their Ships for Perfia, Macha and Juddah, and to the South Sean in thpfe Months they are Wind-bound on the other Coaft: for having the Land-Breezes to carry them off to Sea, the Mofoons are more tavourable.

And here one thing may be worthy our Curiofity, That after the Seafons of the Heats and Rains, the Rivers Indus and Gauges are (aid to fwell their Banks, and thereby abundantly to encreafe the Border ing Countries, where thefe Rains are lefs frequent: Whence, it may be, fome in fight may be had for the Overflows of Egypt, which has fet fo many Wits on the Tenterhooks, where it is reported it never rains :• The Rains more inter mitting on the Coaft of Corommdel, The Caule of the Majfoons inquired into. ♦Water-Snakes.

Carwar was the Chief Port of Vifiapour on this Coaft, but a Grand Tray tor to that King Seva Gi, is now Mafter of it, and the adjacent Countrey as far as Guzerat ; having well nigh forced our Fadory, and done other Outrages on us, which would ask our Fleet a longer time to require Satisfadtion, if they were able, than they could ftay; unlefs they would lofe their Paflage round the Cape of Good Hope, and content themfelves to winter at the Mauritius, which all Ships that outftay their time are forced to. For the Sun being almoft at his Southern Solftice, at his return he leaves a fharp Winter ( which we proved ), and adverfe Winds in thofe Seas, they lying without the Tropick, which fpurs them on for expedition. What this Sew Gi is, and the reafon of his Ufurped Power, a longer Duration in the Countrey muft declare, who is every where named with Terror, he carrying all before him like a mighty Torrent. The Shore is Hilly, and indifferent Woody ; near it Iflets are Mat tered to and again. The People partly Moors, partly Gentues, under the King of Viftt- pour, who was, till this turbulent Seva Gt drove all into a Cotnmo- • tion, a per fed* Monarch, hardly paying the Mogul Tribute, when D hcl in and Vifiapour were united into one Kingdom.

Of thefe, one among another, may be reckoned 6ooco Souls; more by 5C005 than the Portugals ever could. For which Number this IHand is notable to find Provifions, it being mod of it a Rock above Water, and of that which is overflowed, little hopes to recover it.

The Government here now is Englijh ; the Soldiers have Martial Law: The Freemen, Common \ the chief Arbitrator whereof is the Prefident, with his Council at Surat ^ under him is a Jufliciary, and Court of Pleas, with a Committee for Regulation of Affairs, and prefenting all Complaints. The Prefident has a large CommifTion, and is Vice-Regis' y he has a Council here alfo, and a Guard when he w alks or rides abroad, ac companied with a Party of Horfe, which are conftantly kept in the Stables, either for Pleafure or Service. He has his Chaplains, Phy- fician, Chyrurgeons, and Domefticks; his Linguifl:, and Mint- Mafter : At Meals he has his Trumpets ufher in his Courfes, and Soft Mufick at the Table: If he move out of his Chamber, the Sil ver Staves wait on him ; if downStairs, the Guard receive him; if ne go abroad, the Bandarines and Moors under two Standards march betore him : He goes fometimes in his Coach, drawn by large Milk- White Oxen, fometimes on Horfeback, other times in Palenkeens, carried hy Cohors, MuJJlKmen Porters; Always having a Sumhrero of State carried over him: And thofe ct the Englijh inferior to him, have a fuitable Train.

But I believe rather we are here, as Exotick Plants brought home to us, not agreeable to the Soil: For to the Luftier and Frelher, and oftentimes the Tem pera tcft, the Ciime more unkind; but to Old Men and Women it ieems to be more fuitable. Happy certainly then are thofe, and only thofe, brought hither Few returri in their Nonage, before they have a Guft of our Alhion 5 or next to hom ®' them, fuch as intoxicate themfelves with and remember not their former Condition: When it isexpoftulated, Is this the Reward of an harfh and fevere Pupilage ? Is this the Elyfium after a tedious Waftage? For this, will any thirft, will any contend, will any for- fake the Pleafures of his Native Soil, in his Vigorous Age, to bury himfelf alive here ? Were it not more charitable at the firft Bubbles of hislnTant-Sorrows, tomaketHe next Stream over-fwell him? Or elfe if he muilbe full grown for Mifery, how much more compaffio- nate were it to expofe him to an open Combat with the fierceft Duel- Ms in Nature, tofpend at once his Spirits, than to wait a piece- ineai'd Confumption? Yet this abroad and unknown, is the ready Choice of thofe to whom Poverty threatens Contempt at home ; What elfe could urge this wretchecl Remedy ? For thefe are untrodden Paths for Knowledge, little Improvement being to be expe&lt;2:ed from Barbarity. Cuftom and Tradition are only Venerable here; and it is Herefy to be wifer than their Forefathers; which Opinion is both bred and hatched by an innate Sloth ; fo that though we feem near er the Heavens, yet Bodies here are more Earthy, and the Mind wants that adive Fire that always mounts, as if it were extinguifh'd by lis Antipariftafis: Whereby Society and Communication, the Charadfceriftick of Man is wholly loft. What then is to be expeded here, where fordid Thrift is the only Science ? After which, not- withftanding there is fo general an Inqueft, few there be acquire it; For in Five hundred. One hundred furvive not; of that One hun dred, one Qiiarter get not Eftates ; of thofe that do, it has not been recorded above One in Ten Years has feen his Country: And in this difficulty it would hardly be worth a Sober Man's while, much lefs an Ingenuous Man who fliould not defile his purer Thoughts, to be^ ' yo An Hijlorical Account of Letter II. be wholly taken up with fuch mean ( not to fay indired ) Contem- plations j however, a neceflary Adjund, Wealth, may prove to buoy him up on the Surface of Repute, left the Vulgar ferve him as Frogs did their firft rever'd Deity. What Credit jhuj much being premifed for what concerns the Ifland itsfelf, it « b ' h remains to fpeak of it with relation to the Credit it bears among its bours. Neighbours: The Dutch czft an envious Eye on it, and were it in their hands, would doubtlefs make it render all it is capable; and in refped of Commerce it feems to offer many C onveniences; the Bi- nyans liking it better than Surat, living freer, and under milder Taxa tions, which they put the prefent Prefident in fome hopes of com plying with, could he open the way from hence up the Country: but that depending on fo many Intricacies, muft be not only a work of Time, but Power to bring to pafs; as afterwards may fall more properly in our way to make appear. Our prefent Concern then is w ith the Portugal,Seva G /,and the Mo* gul: From the firft is defired no more than a murual Friendlhip; from thefecond', an Appearance only ; from thelaft, a nearer Commerce: The firft and fecond become necellary for Provifions for the Belly, and Building; the third for the Grofs of our Trade: Wherefore Offices of Civility muft be performed to each of thefe, but they fometimes interfering, are the occafion of Jealoufies; thefe three being fo diametrically oppoftte one to another : For while the Mogul brings his Fleet either to Winter or Recruit in this Bay, Seva takes Offence; on the other hand, the Mogul would foon put a ftop to all Buftnefs, fhould he be denied : The Portugal, as in League with nei ther, thinks it a mean compliance in us to allow either of them Coun tenance, efpecially tofurniffi them with Guns and Weapons to turn upon Chriftians, which they wifely make an Inquifition Crime.

Curiofity led me a fecond time to vifit the Ifland Canorein, having obtained leave for a longer Stay; nor went I alone, fome of the beft Qpality on the Ifland being led by the fame defire, joining themfelves with me: We carried a Train of Servants, Horfes, and Palenkeens, which were ferried over before us ,♦ and we coming foon after, were met by the Fraternity, and conduced to the Fathers, who detained us till Afternoon by a (lately Banquet, (hewing us the Civility of the Church and College, diverting us both with Inftrumental and Vocal Mufick, and very good Wine.

From hence, when we had baited, the fame Night we travelled eafily to Magatana, ufing our Fowling-Pieces all the way, being here prefented with Rich Game, as Peacocks, Doves, and Pigeons, Chitrels, or Spotted Deer. When we came to the Town, two feveral Churches drove to re ceive us; but having fome Acquaintance with the Father of the one, and not with the other, we excufed our felves to the latter, and took up with our Friend. As foon as we came in, the Servitors fetch'd us warm Water to wafh our Feet, which was very refrefliing; it put me in mind of Lot's Courtefy to the Angels. After this, as a piece of extraordinary Civility, they fliewed us the Neceflary Houfe; and it is fo in a Countrey where Fluxes are fo common ; and for that rea- fon it is kept as neat as their Lodging Rooms, having Water to wafh after you have ufed a clean Towel hung there for that purpofe. This Night we fared very well. Next Morn before Break of Day we directed our Steps to the anciently fam'd, but now ruin'd City of Canorein ; the way to it is fo delightfome, I thought I bad been in England; fine Arable, Pafture, and Coppices; thus we paded Five Mile to the Foot of the Hill on which the City dands, and had pafled half a Mile through a thick Wood, peopled by Apes, Tygers, wild Buffolo's, and Jackalls; here were fome Flocks of Parockets: When Chap.

The Suhidar of this Town being a Perfon of Quality, who com mands the Countries oppofite to Bomhaim , as Magatan, Penn, and TuU, he thought good to give him a Vifit, and to preferlt him with a couple of Pamerins ; and the rather, becaufe he underftood by the Linguift Mar an Sinaij, he had fome Averfion to our Nation, and might hinder our Proceedings at Coujrt; from which he was willing to take him off by all fair means: He received the Vifit kindly, and promifed all Courtefy that lay in his Power to perform ; and after ibme immaterial Difcourfe they returned to their Tents. The Day following they took Boat, and failed up Choul River, to Proceed on a Town called Eflhemy, fix Leagues diftance from Choul, where they their Journey ftaid till next day ; and fet forth about fix in the Morn from EJlhemy, and aboqt Sun-fee pitched their Tent in a Plain, fix Miles fhort'of Ntfoampore, where they flayed about an hour to refrefti their Coolies, and How the Suhi' dar is created.

In the interim, underftanding they could not be admitted into the Caftle till Seva Gts return, they pitched their Tent in the Plain; and in order to their more fpeedv difpatch, make xheir Bufinefs known to their Procurator Narun Gi Pundit (whofc reception was very kind) and delivered him his Honour's Letters; Ifowing him the feveral Prefents they brought for the Rajah, and Mimilers of State; of which he highly approved, and promifed them to help them to the Rajitis prefence, as foon as Conveniently he could after his return from Pil grimage to Purtaahgur: And bad them reft content, that his Endea vours fhould be totally employed in the Honourable Company's In- tereft, and procuring them a fpeedy difpatch: For which having ren dered him Thanks, he pre fen ted him with the Articles which they brought for the Rajah to fign, tranflated into Mo ratty Language; which he faid he would perufe, and then give his judgment of them. He then took occafion to difcourfe with him concerning the Conclu* fion of a Peace betwixt the Rajah and the Syddy of Banda Rajapore ; urging many Arguments to create in him a belief it would be for the Rajah's advantage, but he would not be perfuaded it was for his Ma iler's Intereft to raife a Siege which had coft him fo much Blood and Treafure; efpecially now he hath fuch hopes of gaining the Place: And therefore told them, it would be in vain to move it to the Raj t ab t who was refolved to take in theCaftle, let it coft him what it will: And to that effed: was daily fending down more Ordnance, Ammu nition, Men and Money. Our AmbalTador replied, The Prefident had no other Dcfign in making this motion, than that of a good Neighbour ; havingob- ferved the Miferieseach Party endured, and the general obftrudion 01 Trade, occafioned by the War; but fince he defired him to defift mentioning it to the Rajah, he fhould not trouble him therewith ; but w hat u as more confiftent with our own and his Intereft ; which was the encouraging Trade and Merchandife in his Country, and opening the ways to Ba/igaot, that Merchants might with fafety bring down their Goods to Port • which would be much to the Rajah's Profit, an encreafe of his Treafury: And this he recommended to his Pru- ence to perfuade the Rajah thereto; who being a Soldier from his Infancy, its poftible minded not fuch concerns. f U ^ C / l a . n ^ werec '&gt; That he doubted not but it would be ef- ^ u / &gt; ^ or t ^ at the King of Fifiapour, who is Owner o thole Countries (from whence moft forts of Wares come) being eary 0 Wars witn his Mailer, had fent feveral Embaffies to con- elude-MiSs 0 theCk, 'ftheHJl ^ t0 'S m ^l ^ Oro nation. u; ^ ^ Pagod, L1 , not be admitted a their TentiDt^. m ^ e Buio^ ' 0 ic reception^^ rs; fcwingjiiiD^ MimilersotS^,^. ito help them to (kt uid alter his rctn ! e reft content, tktil itch: Forwliiciitijti;! ith the Articles A; :ed into Mmttj if; i give his judgmtK; him concerning tkCi he SjddjiOiEdk la beliefitwooldb perfuaded itwsfei lopes of gaining tkl /aintomoveitroi et it colt liim nmore nt had no odNeighboor; nee hec trouble U--. nd histof^i flteOwBtry.* mtcbtotbc^ e recoflJine^^y •'ffiS Who procu red their pafs up to the Ca- ftle.

This is the Subftance of his Difcourfe with ManmGi Pundit, who feemed to him to' be a Man of Prudence and Efteem with hisMafter: So after a lit tle fitting he took his leave of him, having firfl: prefented him with a Diamond Ring, for which he exprelTed a liking; and his Eidell: Son a Couple of Pamerins, which are fine Mantles. They continuing under their Tent, found it very hot and incom modious; wherefore they were glad when they heard the Rajah was returned from Purtaah^ur , when the Ambafladour follicited Narun Gi Pundit to procure his leave to pafs up the Hill into Rairee Caille: The next day they received order to afcend the Hill into the Caftle, the Rajah having appointed an Houfe for them; which they did ; leaving Pmcharra about Three in the Afternoon, they arrived at the top of that ftrong Mountain, forfaking the humble Clouds about Sun«fet. ft is fortified by Nature more than Art, being of very difficult accefs, there being but one Avenue to it, which is guarded by two narrow Gates, and fortified by a ftrong Wall exceeding high, and Baftions thereto: All the other part of the Mountain is a dired: Pre cipice; fo that it's impregnable, except the Treachery of fome in it betray it. .On the Mounrain are many ftrong Buildings, asthe/fo- jah's Court, and HoufesoF other Minifters, to the number of about ^oo. It is in length about two Miles and an half, but no pleafant Trees/ or any fort of Grain grows thereon. Their Houfe was about a Mile from the Rajatfs Palace, into which they retired with no lit-, tie content. Four days after their afcent, by the follicitation of JSfarun Gi Pun- Jit, the Rajah gave them Audience, though bufily imployed by ma ny other great Affairs, relating to his Coronation and Marriage. Our Ambaflador prefented him, and his Son Samha Gt Rajzh, with the Particulars appointed for them; which they took well fatisfied with them; -and the Rajah aftuted them we might trade fecurely in all his Countries without the leaft apprehenfion of 111 from him, for that the Peace was concluded. Our AmbafTadour replied, that was our Intent; and to that intent the Prefident had fent him to this Court to procure the fame Articles and Privileges we enjoyed in Indojtan and Perfia, where we traded. He anfwered, it is well, and referred our Bufitiefs to Moro Pundit his Pejhua, or Chancellour, to examine our Articles, and give an account what they were. He and his Son withdrew into their private Apartments, to confult with the Brach- mines about the Ceremonies preparatory to his Enftalment; which chiefly confided in Abftinence and Purifying; till which be over, he will hear no farther of Bufinefs. They likewife departed to their Lodgings. A day or two after our AmbafTador went to Narun Gi Pundit^ and took his Advice concerning the prcfenting of the reft ; who told him he The Etjglijh have Audi ence of Seva Gi.

But fince thefe Sores are fortunately bound up in that Con jugal Tye betwixt our Sacred King and the Sifler of Portugal, laying all foul Words and Blows afide, let us fee how the Affairs ftand be twixt them and the Dutch, who followed our Steps, and got in at the Breach we made.

Wherefore our Ships almoft alone, were it not for a little the French of late, lade Calicutsfor Europe: The Dutch have a Fadory here, that vend the Spices they bring from Batavia, and invert part of the Money in courfe Cloath, to be difpofed among their Planters, or fold to the Malayans, and fend the reft back in Rupees: So that we fingly have the Credit of thePort, andareof moft advantage to the Inhabitants, and fill the Cuftom-Houfe with the fubftantialefl In- CO u m r S V ^ Ut rt0t ! 0 ckfra ' d , the Fre ' cb of their M Conimendations, whole Fadtory is better ftor'd with Monfieurs than with Cafh they hve well, borrow Money, and make a Shew: Here are French Capuchins, who have a Convent, and live in Efteem.

Here is one that has vowed to hang by the Heels, till he get Money enough to build a Mofch to Mahomet, that he may be held a Saint. Another fhall travel the Country with an Horn blowed afore him, and an Ox it may be to carry him and his Baggage, befides one to wait on him with a Peacock's Tail; whilft he rattles a great Iron Chain fettered to his Foot, as big as thofe Ele- phants are Foot-locked with, fome two yards in length, every Link thicker than a Man's Thumb, and a Palm in length ; his fhaking this fpeaks his Necelfity, which the poor Gentiles dare not deny to relieve ; for if they do, he accufes them to the Cazy, who defires no better opportunity to fleece them : Fpr they will not ftick to fwear they blafphemed Mahomet, for which there is no evafion but to de- pofit, or be cut, and made a Moor, Moft of thefe are Vagabonds^ and are the Peft of the Nation they livfe in; fome of them live in Gardens and retired Places in the Fields, in the fame manner as the Seers of old, and the Children of the Pro phets did : Their Habit is the main thing that fignalizes them more than their Virtue; they profefs Poverty, but make all things their own where they come; all the heat of the Day they idle it under fome fhady Tree, at night they come in Troops, armed with a great Pole, a Mirchal or Peacock's Tail, and a Wallet; more like Plun derers than Beggers; they go into the Market, or to the Shop keepers, and force an Alms, none of them returning without his fhare ; Some of them pafs the bounds of a modeft Requeft, and bawl out in the open Streets for an Hundred Rupees, and nothing lefs will fatisfy thefe. They are cloathed with a ragged Mantle, which ferves them alfo for a Matrafs, for which purpole fome have Lyons, Tygres or Leo pards Skins to lay under them : The Civilefl of them wear Flefti-co- loured Vefts, fome what like our Brick-makers Frocks, and almoft of that Colour. The Merchants, as their Adventures return, are bountiful towards them, by which means fome of them thrive upon it. ' Thefe Field Conventiclers at the hours of Devotion beat a Drum, from them called the Fakiers Drum; here are of thefe Strolers about this City enough to make an Army, that they are almoft become for midable to the Citizens; nor is the Governour powerful enough to correct their Infolencies.

For all the Governor comes to his beat attended every Morning with 300 Foot with Fire-Arms, Three Elephants in their Cloathins (which is here alfo a principal Mark of the Greatnefs of thefe Men in place, the more Elephants they keep, they are looked on as more Honourable) Forty Horfes mounted. Four and twenty Banners of State; befides a large Retinue of the Cazy's, who is always prefent to aflift him in Law Points. Moreover he has Loud Trumpets made as big, and like our Stentoro Phcnica, or fpeaking Trumpet, with Thundring Kettle-Drums; yet neither the Formality of this Ap pearance, nor regard due to hisOiEce, is terrible enough to prevail with thefe to fubmit to refign the Caitiff and hardly is his whole Force able to keep them from bare-faced Rebellion. But though thefe Outlaws (for as fuch they ought to belook'd on, while they difown all Subjection ) behave themfelves thus, the poor Inhabitants that work for their Bread, are under feverer Re- flraints^ for the Governor's Servants being upheld by as uncon- trouled Licentioufnefs, on pretence of preifing the Craftfmen from their daily Labour into the Governor's Service, extort continued Fees from them, or elfe they are fure to be fet on work, without any thing for their Pains: Which was but even nowrfnade a Publick Grievance, by the Refiftance of a flurdy Pat an, ( who is fprungfrom a Warlike People , of whom it is faid, They never draw their Swords, but Blood muft follow ): And thus it happen'd ; Theftata* having emploj'd a Taylor at his houfe, one of the Governor's Men feized him for his Matter's Service; but the Patan ruftiing in tore- leafe him, the Soldier ran a young Brother of the Patans through, naked and unconcerned in the Scuffle; which fo enraged the/W, that forcing the Sword cut of the hand of this inhuman Butcher, he kiird him and two more that came to his Refcue ; and going in to his houfe, flew his own Wife, and Sifitr, and a little Son of his own, that they might not fall a Sacrifice to the Governor's Rage: The wretched Taylor, animated by the Example of the Patan (tho but coolly }, had murder'd his Wife had Ihe not fled ; but laying hold on his Old Father and Mother, he difpatched them ; and bolt ing forth into the Street, fet upon what Governor's Men he and the Patan could meet: Tidings whereof flriking the Governors Ears, Re came with all his Power to befet the exafperated and defperateMenj but though a Thoufand Men were up in Arms, and gazing upon the Patan flanding with his Sword in his hand at the Entrance of the Houfe, none durft venture to apprehend him; till his Fury abating, and Promifes given by a Great Man, of Favour if he refigned; he attending to his Parley, in the mean while two Men with Guns from atop of the Houfe dilcharged on him, and wounded him and the Taylor mortally, but not before they had carried this falfe Great Man \vith lome of his Attendants along with them out of the World ; So that thefe Curs fet to keep the Sheep, are the firft that worry them. , * u 1 f ( a: ^hew of Juftice ihould be banifhed, now and t len, when they have not Mony to buy it off, or the Emperor be inform-' : V1»;. .'JW 1 ^.

The one was of an Armenian^ Chawhucked through the City for fel ling of Wine. The other was of a Goldfmith who had coined Copper Rupees; firfl: they fliaved his Head and Beard, as our Countrymen do Bayliffs when they prefiime to Arreft in Priviledg'd Places ; then putting a Fool's Cap on his Head, they fet him on an Afs, with his Face to the Tail, which is led by an Holenccre, and one of their Drums is beat before him, which is an Affront of the higheil degree; thus they lead him up and down the City, where the Boys and Sol diers treat him but fcurvily, pelting him all the way he pafles : Being brought back toPrifon, they cut off his Hand, and let him lye du ring the Governor's Pleafure. The Third was of a Pack of Thieves 'that had infefted the Roads a longtime, and after fome whiles Impri- fonment the Banyans proffered Money for their Redemption ; but the Great Mogul fending an Exprefs, they were led to Execution; They were Fifteen, all of a Gang, who ufed to lurk under Hedges in nar row Lanes, and as they found opportunity, by a Device of a Weight tied to a Cotton Bowftring made of Guts, (with which they tew Cot ton ) of fome length, they ufed to throw it upon Paflengers fo, that winding it about their Necks, they pulled them from their Beads, and dragging them upon the Ground ftrangled them, and pofieffed them- felves of what they had: One of thefe was an Old Man with his two Sons, the youngeft not fourteen. This being their Practice, they were fentenced, according to Lex Talionis , to be hang'd ; wherefore being delivered to the Catvoal , or Sheriff's Men, they led them two Miles with Ropes about their Necks to fome wild Date- Trees : In their way thither they were chearful, and went Tinging, and fmoaking Tobacco, the giving them Sweetmeats, they being as jolly as if going to a Wedding; and the Young Lad now ready to be tied up, boafled. That though he were not Fourteen Years of Age, he had killed his Fifteen Men ; wherefore the Old Man, as he had been a Leader of thefe Two, was firfl; made an Exam ple for his Villany, and then the two Striplings were advanced, as all the reft were, half a Foot from the Ground; and then cutting their Legs off that the Blood might flow from them, they left them miferable Spectacles, hanging till they dropped of their own accord. The following Delinquents being of another kind, we fhall fee how they fare: The one was of a Rich Merchant of the Moors kil-^ ling his Wife, and a Child he had by her of Three Years old, upon taking her with her Paramour in Adultery; for which Crime a Pe cuniary Muld excufed him : The other was a Boy's flicking a So- domit 'ifh Moor to the Heart with his own Catarre , while he attempt ed upon his Body; which Fad: was fo far from being accufed as a Fault, that the Boy came off with Commendation; though there is nothing more frequently committed among them, than the unna tural Sin of Buggery. There is another thing above all the reft an unpardonable Oflence ; for a Banyan or Rich Broker to grow Wealthy without Protection of fome Great Perfon ; for it is fo mighty a Difquiet to the Governor, O that Chap.

The next in the Executive Power is the Catwal, the Governor of the Night, as the other two Great Officers rule the Day ; or nearer our Conftitution, the Sheriff of the City: For after the Keys are carried to the Governor, it is the Catwals Bufinefs with a Guard of near Two hundred Menjto fcower the Streets and Brothels of Idle Companions; to take an account of all People late out, to difcover Fires and Houfe-' breakers, and to carry all lewd Perfons to Prifon, which isfolely committed to his Charge: So that all Night long he is heard by his Drums and Trumpets, Ihouting and hallowing of his Crew in their Perambulation through all Parts of the City; with Lights and Flam beaus, with fome few of his Companions in Coaches or Palenkeens ; Moreover he feifes all Debtors, and fecures them, and hasthecareof Punifhing and Executing all Offenders. This is a Place of great Trufl, but neither fo Honourable or Pro fitable as the ShawhundeSs is j who is King of the Port, or Chief Cuftomer, though fomething abated by the Mogul's too fondly in a Religious Vanity granting Immunity to the Musjlemen lately, which is no fmall detriment. The Cuflom-houfe has a good Front, where the Chief Cuflomer appears certain hours to chop, that is, to mark Goods outward- bound, and clear thofe received in : Upon any fufpicion of default he has a Black-Guard that by a Chawhuck, a great Whip, extorts Con- ieflion : There is another hangs up at the daily Waiters, or Meerhars Choultry, by the Landing-place, as a terror to make them pay Ctf/dr his due; the Puniihment, if detected , being only Corporal, not Confifcation ot Goods: This Place is filled with Publicans, Waiters and Porters, who are always at the Receipt of Cuflom, but are a lit tle too tardy fometimes in the delivery of Goods, making the Mer chant dance attendance, till a right underftanding be created be twixt the Shaivhunder and them, which commonly follows when the Fifl is mollified.

Up and down the City are Remains of Seva G/'s Fury, the Ruins being not yet repaired ; of whom they ftand in hourly fear, having their Sores dill frelh in their Memory: To prevent whofe Rage, they are collecting an Hundred thoufand Rupees till their Walls be finifhed, when we fhall fee how they will defend them; having 700 Men allotted for that Office, befides Europe Gunners at every Gate, which are Six in number, befide 36 Baftions with half a dozen great Guns apiece: Upon the top they have piled fpiked Timber to annoy the Scalers. Every Gate is barbed with Iron Spikes to break the rufhing in of the Elephants; thefealfo are under a diflind: Command. The Governor pf the Town has an Army of 1500 Men in pay, with Matchlocks, Swords and Javelins; Two hundred Horfe with Quivers full of Arrows at the Bow of their Saddles, Lances at their Right Stirrup, and Swords of an unweildy bulk, with Bucklers hang ing over their Shoulders; their Bows are curioufly and flrongly made with Horn,* and for that reafon better in Dry than Wet Weather. Among the many Mofchs to and again, only two are famous with Their Mofchi Jong Spires by the Wall, where is a {lately Dwelling for the Xeriff. They have Three other Places for Strangers called Caravan-Se- rawes y or Inns, intended by the Donors gratis, but fince perverted, and let out to Foreigners. Near the Governor's Stables were Forty Camels houfed, ready for War, and half a dozen Elephants. Thefe Stables arc rather Sheds, or Booths of Hair-cloath, to re move on occafion, than any Building fixed for that purpofe ; and were it not for the manner of treating their Horfes, not worth the mentioning: They have no Racks, but feed as Nature intended them^ from the Ground, if they get Hay; for their Corn, it is ufually Ga- ravance, a fort of Peafe which they put into an Hair Bag, and by a String (clapping their Mouths into it) faftned behind their Ears, is kept from the Ground ; out of this they have their daily Allowance; befide Butter, Sugar and Jaggaree or Mulafio s made into Pad, with the Meal of Garavance, which fattens all their Beafls of War, and makes them flick and fine; they cover them very warm with a kind of Felt or Flock-work, two or three double, and tye them by all their Feet ftretched out at length; in which pofture they always fland : When they make their Beds, they fift the Dung they make^ after it is dried in the Sun, and make a foft lying for them of it; they court them with all the gentlenefs and kind Speeches imagi- O % nable, Caravans, Stables,lOO mmm^^rnrn A Defcription Surat, Letter nr nable, feldom or never fpeaking to, or ufing them harlhly; every 'W Horfe has one Man wholly imployed abont his Service, and pretends The Gover nor quarrels with the Dutch.

HAving obtained Leave of the Governor, we went out of the Walls by Broach Gzte (they taking Names from the chief Pla ces they lead to ), where, as at every Gate, (lands a Chocky, or Watch to receive Toll for the Emperor; and which is a fliame, a Rafpoot alfo for the Rafpoots, otherwife they would infeft the Villa- ges adjacent, and drive away the Cattel ; for all which it is unfafe to be far out of the Town late ar Night, unlefs well guarded. This way was all ftrewed with Moor-men s Tombs, and one of efpecial Note of a Ferfian Ambaffidor, who returning from England with Sir Anthony Shirley, is reported to poyfon himfelf here, rather than anfwer fome ill Management of his Office to his Mailer: Not far from whence, on a fmall Hill on the left hand of the Road, lies Tom Coriat, our Engli[h Fakier ( as they name him ), together with an Armenian Chriftizn, known by their Graves lying Eaft znd Wefl : He was fo confident of his Perfection in the Indo/ianTongue, that he ventured to play the Orator in it before the Great Mogul, In his re turn from him he was killed with Kindnefs by the Englijh Merchants, which laid his rambling Brains at Reft.

Another Devote had made a Vow not to lye down in Sixteen Years, but to keep on his Feet all that while ; this came accompa nied with two others under the fame Oath, the one had pafled Five, the other Three Years; all Three of them had their Legs fwoln as big as their Bodies, with filthy running Ulcers, expofed to view for the^ greater Applaufe: Standing, they leaned on Pillows hung in a String from the Banyan Tree, and had a Pompous Attendance of fuch ragged Fakiers their Admirers, with Mufick, Flags, and Mir~ chals: The Eldefl having undergone the compleat Term, to trown all, was intombed in the fame Handing Pofture Nine Days without any fort of Food; and left any Pretext of that kind might leffen his Undertaking, he caufed a Bank of Earth to be heaped on the Mouth of his Cave, whereon was to be fown a certain Grain which ears in Nine Days, which accordingly being done, eared before his being taken thence. I faw him prefently after his Refurred:ion, in great State raifed on a Throne under a Canopy, before which was a Fire made in the Pit he had been, where he put his Hands, being anointed with Oyl, untouch'd by the Flames: Which whether this may dif- cover the Cheat of both this and the other, that fuch an Undhon may be to refift Fire, Naturalifts have not agreed in ; and therefore I judge this rather a Delufion, I having not been prefent at this Ex periment : But that this is none I am aflured.

In their great Solemnities it is ufual for them to fetit around, with Lamps to the Number of two or three Lecgues, which is fo many Hundred thou- fand in our Account. The Citizens by the King's Favour have good ftore of Gardens neighbouring ; the biggefl; of all is the Queen's, though fome Private Men have neater, where we often go to take the Air, and feaft in pleafant or Summer-Houfes, fpread after the manner with Carpets, refrefhed with various Figures of the Rifing Water, out of feveral Spouts from fquare Tanks Pargetted. All the time of our durance here Water is fprinkled, to mitigate theFierinefs of the Sun- Here are Grottoes defcending alfo under Ground by huge Arches and Stone Steps fliaded by Trees on each hand, till it come to the deep Well at bottom, from whence by Leathern Bags drawn upon Wheels by Oxen, the Water is carried up, and in Gutters flreams about the Gardens. In thefe by the help of a Erachmin skilled in Simples, I have found the Silk Cotton-tree, diftinguifhed by us from the Vulgar beneficial one, by its being a Tree, the other a Shrub ; it is moft like a Maple in Leat and Branch, only the Bark is not furrowed; it brings forth between three Leaves, firfl a Bud or Button,then a white Flower, laft of all Seed about which the Cotton grows, in three diftind: Cells an- fwering the three Leaves.

But for all thefe great Preparations, as yet they dare not ventnre out without Europe Paffes, or Pilots; though fome of their Ships carry 50 or 40 Pieces of Cannon, more for Shew than Service. Be fides thefe Merchant-Men , here are Three or Four Men of War as big as Third Rate Ships: The other are Frigats fit to Row or Sail, made with Prows inftead of Beaks, more ufeful in Rivers and Creeks, than in the Main. The Emperor alfo has four great Ships in Pay al ways, to carry Pilgrims to M&amp;cha on free Coft, and bring them back from HoJge, where they prove a Crew of fandified Varlets. The Heir of Bantam is now here to take his PafTage thither in one of them, with his Retinue, which are fome of the Pengrim or Lords of the Country, his Unkle and others, which were about Twenty, with their Wives: He was firft at Bomhaim^ where he was entertain ed like a Prince, for the Obligation the Company have to their Trade there, he having been difobedient to the King his Father, and has not yet Ihewed any kindnefs to the Englifh^ fiding rather with the Dutch Intcreft to undermine the Old King, and lettle them in the Pepper-trade, which afterwards will not be in his Power to redeem out of their hands: Here little notice is taken of him, they all being in miferable poor Habits, and he of little Credit, being a Giddyhead, were it not for the Captain that brought him, a Confident of the Old King's, who furnifhes him with Money but fparingly, he being indifcreet in his Expences.

At this time the Walls of the City, and Towers of the Caitle, wanted not their Adornments, being beftuck with bloody Enfigns, and fmoking with Guns of jubilee, as well as tooting with their Trumpets, and beating with their Drums; as the Jews on their Sabbaths, or their folemn Feaft days were wont.

This is done through the Streets, where if two Compa* nies encounter, they feJdom part without bloody Nofes ; which Oc- cafion being given like £/au's Intentions on the Day of his Father s Lamentation, to revenge himfelf on his Brother Jacoh, has been the Caufe why the Mogul has reftrained it for the prevention of Out rages; but yet his Mandate is notfo valid to make them forfake it here; After Sun-fet they eat, and fall to fmging the Pfalms of Doud, or David, in the moft confonant Tone I have heard. The laft Day they prepare a couple of Coffins, and have a Man or two on Horfeback all beftuck like our Man in the Almanack, with Arrows; thefe ride reeling, and ready to dropoff their Horfes for Faintnefs, till they come to the River, where they put the Coffins afloat with a loud Cry, and then returning, repeat with great Vene ration their Names, and after this trim their Beards, wafti and fhift their Cloaths, (all this while worn negligently, as Mourners) and re turn to their morebeaflly Vomit of Luxury, than this of more than Manly Fury.

On an Eclipfe of the Sun or Moon , the Moots are in a lamentable How they be- Plight, making a great Noife with Pots and Pans, and other noify have them- Inftruments; not omitting their Prayers, fancying them prevalent ciipfes' 1 ^ to deliver them from their Travel. When the Heathens, inftrudled by their Bracirmnsy by a better Philofophy, declare to them the Day before the two great Luminaries are obicured by the Interpofition of the Moon's, or Earth's Globe, that they may Fafl, Wafh, and Purify themfelves for Twenty four Hours before the Eclipfe happens, and all the time of its lading &gt; after which is paft, they feaft and beftow their Benevolence freely on the Brachmins^ holding them for this their profound Knowledge, in mighty Admiration. And though the Jollity and Pomp of the Heathens is much al layed by the Puritanifm and unlimited Power of the Moors, info- much that they are wholly forbidden to Burn their Wives with the Hu£- » A Defcripion of Surat Husbands ,• yet muft not the Indians be totally denied their Feafls and chiefly that of their publick Nuptials, which comes in twice a Year; as the At ticks in their yzfJ^Xiuv in January and Oftoher, fo thefe in the Months Fulgannau and Fuxu, in January and March; to enjoy which times of Feftivity, the Governor cxpeds large Gratui. ties, which they colled as every one can afford ; All which times they make Procefiions, and appear, (efpecially the Children and young Folks) in rich Drefles of Gold and Silver, Mitres on their Heads, and weighty Safhes about their Middles, bedawbed and ftained all over with Saffron Colour; the Married Folks riding on Horfeback, Palenkeens, and Coaches, fplendidly adorned, drawn by Oxen, Goats, and Elks, Painted over with Saffron, their Horns tipped with Silver.; Mufick, Streamers, and Banners going before them, the Women Singing Epithalamiums, the Men following, and a great Attendance with Pageants, Mirchals, and Kitfols ^ giving Tavon and Coco-Nuts frankly, as they pafs. The Ceremonies after Wafhing and Cleanfing, conclude by their Sitting Two Hours Tied by the Neck, while the Prieft Prays, the W man being then Manacled with Gold or Silver Shackles about her Wnftsand Ankles, a white Sheet being held over them Unvailed, a Coco Nut exchanged to confirm the Bargain, and Corn fcattered upon them; all Emblems of the Matrimonial Bands, Chaftity and a firm refolution to comply with one anothers Fortunes; and then difmif- fes them, by fprinkling Water on the Married Couple, that they may Increafe and Multiply. The Women are never Married more than once, the Men are under no fuch Obligation. 1 he firfl New Moon in Oftoher, is the Banyans Dually, a great Day of Celebration to their Pagan Deities, when they are very kind- hearted , prefenting their Makers with Gifts, as knowing they fliall be no Lofers, and Entertain one another with mutual Mirth and Banquetting. The next Moon their Women flock to the Sacred Wells; where, they fay, it is not difficult to perfuade them to be kind, fuppofing their Pollutions not to remain after their Waftiing in thefe Holy Waters. March begins with a Licentious Week of Sports and Rejoycing, wherein they are not wanting for Lafcivious Difcourle, nor are they to be offended at any Jeft or Waggery. And to fhew their Benefi- cence at the beginning of the Rains, they Treat the Ants and Flies with Sweatmeats and Wafers, fludioufly fetting Hony, Syrups, or any thing that may entice them to their own death, out of their way; allowing them Sugar, or any other dried Contecls for their Repair, inftead of them. They are conftant Benefactors fo the Dogs, which are many, the itches littering in the Streets; but avoid touching them, as they would zn Holencore, whom if their Garments chance to brufh, they hie them home, Shift, and Wafh. And now we enter upon the Ago firft of the Moors : They love to outdo one another m Peats of A&amp;ivity, as Riding full fpeed, and to ftop with a Jerk, or motion of the Body, their Horfes be- i-g well managed ; Tilting and Gereeding , that is, Cafting of Darts,and Journy into Duccan. 11 i h Darts, both for Utility and Recreation 5 Shooting with Bows and Chap. lit Arrows, which is near at hand, not far off, as we at Rovers; Running on Foot, which belongs to the Pattamars, the only Foot-polls of this Country, who Run fo many Courfes every Morning, or elfe Dance fo many hours to a Tune called the Patamars Tune, when they labour as much as a Lancajhire Man does at Roger of Coverly, or the Taran tula of their Hornpipe; thefe wear Feathers in their Turbats. The Wreftlers Anoint with Oil, and are Naked, only a Belt about Wreftliag. their Waftes, in which they weary one another only by pure Strength and Luxation, not by Skill or Circumvention; thefe two laft ufe Opium to make them perform things beyond their ftrength ; and it is incredible to think how far thefe will Travel before the vir tue of it be worked off. ' Hunting-of Tigers is fometimes a Paflime, at others a Tragy-Co- Hunting, medy; for befetting a Wood where Tigers lurk, with Men and Hor- fes, and putting a Set of their loud Mufick to ftrike up in the middle of it; they rouze at the unaccuftomed Noize, and rulhing forth feize the firft in their way, if not Shot or Launced, to prevent them: Wild Bulls and Buff olds are as dangerous, nor is the Boar lefs fierce than any of them. Antilopes are fet upon by Leopards on this wife; they carry the Leo pards on Hackeries froth for lefs fufpicion, and to give them the advan tage of their Spring; which if they Iofe,they follownot their Preyjbe- ing for a furprize; wherefore the Hackeries wheel about at a diftance, till they come near enough to apprehend them, they feeding fearlefs of the Hackeries ; then with three or four Leaps, after a fmall Chace, feize them, and eafily become their Matters. The Great Men have Perfian Greyhounds, which they Cloathe in Cold Weather, and fome few Hawks \ a Colum may be Hunted with a Greyhound, as we do Buftards, being a great Fowl and long in Rifing. Bufolds animated by their Keepers, fight with great fury; their Bufotfs and Horns, being reverfed,-areufelefs; but they knock Foreheads with a 0 force adequate to fuch great Engines, till they are all of a gore, and follow their blow with fuch vigour, that the ftrength of their Backs exert themfelves into their Natural Parts, which they brandilh as if ftimulated to Venery; the ftronger will hardly permit the weaker to go back to return with his force, but prefling on him, endeavours to bear him down ; thus foiling one another, they are a long time before they will yield. Perfian Rams fet together in this manner, are not parted without a bloody Cataftrophe, which are kept on purpofe for the fport of their Great Men ; as like wife are Elephants, who engage at the Will of their Matters. Here are no Gladiators, but at Cudgels they will play as at Back- fword, till they warm one another. The chief Pleafure of the Gentiles^ or Banyans, is to Cheat one T^ e ^ f a ^ r ' another, conceiving therein the higheft Felicity, though it be ^Inyam, * 8 Cuckolding, which they are expert at.

For whofe Trial, after a long endeavour to bring him to acknow- Captain shax- ledgment, was erected a feledt Court of Judicature,* and an Attorny ? »« renthome - ordered to impeach him, who with fome borrowed Rhetorick en deavoured to make him appear a Second Catiline ; but he cleared himfelf fo handfomely of all Objedions (being Tick at that time the Stirs were, and having no reference to him, their Complaints being of another nature, as the taking Money for more than could be paf- fed current again, and other like pretended Exadtions) that they had no more to anfwer, than that it fhould be referred to the Company; before whom he muft perfonally appear, and therefore was ordered home, but was prevented by Death at the end of his Voyage: Other- R wifeI 22 A Defcription of Surat, A Sea-Tortoife taken.

By this Mans Misfortune might have been feen the diflike that the Company's Servants bear towards any of equal poife with themfelves, and not of that Rank ; for thereby they count they are injured, having others put over their heads, as 'tis termed; but if by chance they convince them of their Folly, it becomes a Crime un- pardonable: The firft ground of this Quarrel being upon unnece&amp;y Appendices to the Fort, as Pallifadoes in Mud, fo contrived, that they were rather a means to take than defend it, which afterwards were all wafhed away by the Rains; to thefe fome Defpight being added (he being a Man fharp in his Jefls, and blunt in Counfel) it never ended, till it proved as fatal as Remuts leaping over his Bro ther Romulus his Ditch, call for a Trench about Old Rome. Few days had been fpent afore a Sea Tortoife was brought to the Fort, in Length Six Feet, the content of his Hut near two Bulhels, reckoning only that part with which his Back is fliielded, being an huge Shell of a brown Colour; never to be made tranfparent as tbofe come from the South-Seas are, nor eafily to be crackt by any weight ; for Experiment, I and two more got upon it, and the Tortoife un concerned carried us: Its Head is loricated with Scales, the Neck reaching as far as the Hut, foft and undefenfible5 the Fins are four, placed inftead of Legs, by which it crawls as wellasfwims} the Belly is covered with a Breaft-plate called the Callapee, foft and whitifh in refped of the Back-piece or Callipet ; its Tail is Ihort and wreathed like a Serpent's; altogether it is as lovely as a Toad: It fighs like a Woman, and weeps like a Child; being taken and turned on its back, it is fhiftlefs. I caufed it to be opened, and examined its Heart, which (con trary to the Opinion of the Vulgar) is but One, they affirming it to be Three, grounded on this Miftake; the Auricles being larger than in other Creatures, equalling almoft the Ventricles and whole Body of the Heart, which is bigger in proportion than belongs to fuch an Animal, being as large as an Ox's; which might be the reafon of itsPufilanimity; The Veins and Arteries were filled with Currents of cold black Blood : It participates more of Fkfli than Fifli, of a vi viparous than oviparous Offspring, yet lays imperfed: Eggs without aCruft (only covered with a Membrane, being moft Yolk) buried by it in the Sands, to receive from the Sun's heat the perfedion of their Hatching (as the Eggs of Egypt from Furnaces, or others from Dunghills): It fpavvns them as Filh do, in huge quantities, as much at one time as will more than fill a Seaman's Bonnet (every one being as big as an Hen's Egg). By them aboard Ship they are or dered like buttered Eggs of a Fowl, though nearer akin to a Ser pent s, hanging together as thofe do. For this end they come alhore, and when purfued, caft up with their Claws a Cloud of Sand to blind their Enemies; when overtaken lome are fo big, tour men can hardly turn them.

One of the Mogul's Generals over Seventeen thoufand Horfe, and Three thoufand Foot,and Governor otjeneah (the Chief City of that Kingdom ) having occafion for one of my Function', on St. George's Day I was commanded by the Honourable Aungier, with only Oral Inftrudions, toembarque on a Bomhaim Boat of Twelve Oars and a SteerVman, waited on by two of the Governor's Servants, four Moor Peons, a Portuguez, my own Servants, a Brachmin for Lin- guilt, an Horfe-keeper, eight Coolies to my Faknkeen , a dozen Frajfes for Lumber, and one Horfe. Thus equipped, I left Bomhaim about Three in the Afternoon, Take Boat for and the fame Night about Nine Anchored on this fide Tanaw, where in our paflage were vifible a great way off, on the tops of the Moun tains, feveral Fortrefles of Seva Gis , only defenfible by Nature, needing no other Artillery but Stones, which they tumble down up on their Foes, carrying as certain deftrudion with them as Bullets where they alight: The next Morning, with only fending my Ser vant afhore to acquaint the Rendero, I quitted the Pafs; and a Mile beyond the City deferted Ba^ein River on the left, and took our Courfe up a fpacious Navigable River, which makes the Ifland of Ba~ yin, the Banks of which are low and fruitful; on both fides are placed (lately Aldeas, and Dwellings of the Portugal Fidqlgos &gt; till on the Right, within a Mile or more of Guile an, they yield pofleflion to the Neigbouring Seva G/,at which City (the Key this way into that Rebels Country) Wind and Tide favouring us, we landed at about Nine in the Morning, and were civilly treated by the Cuftomer in his Choultry, till the Havaldar could be acquainted of my arrival; who immediatly ordered me a great Mofch for my reception, whence I fent the Brachmin to complement him, and deliver the Prefidents Letter.

The Houfes the prefent Inhabitants kennel in are mean, the Peo ple beggarly, by reafon of thefe Hoftile Incurfions. By Twelve at Noon having journey'd over Rocky, Barren, and Parched Ways, I came to Intwally, Three Courfe, or Seven Mile and an half; the Seafon of the Year (the Heats being now motlvio lent} as well as the Time of the Day not permitting us any longer to endure their Extremity, I never ftaid for Licenfe, but fkded my felf under a Wooden Mofque, the only Structure (landing in the Town, it fuffering the fame Fate with GuQeanpnA was then reakingirt itsAfheSjthe Mogulskxvny laying wafte all in their RoadjbothViilages, Fodder, and Corn; and for their Cattel they drive them along with them, and take them, their Wives and Children for Slaves; fothat none efcape, except thofe that can fly fafteft,or hide themfelvesinthe Woods, which they alfo fet on fire, to leave them deftitute of thefe Recefles.

They have no publick Fagod, or Place of Worlhip, befides thefeT^b, where they wafh and burn their Dead, giving me a Nofegay of one of their Carkafes, before I got my Break- fad , as I lay to repofe under a Tree; which made me range for Game, and difperfe my Servants for Provant, being otherwife likely to go without; they living upon Batty, or Seeds of Grafs, eating neither Filh nor Flefh, neither indeed have they any, unlefs by chance; for after my Purveyors had made diligent fearch, with much ado they purchafed one Hen, tho feveral Villages were in fight, and all of them greedy enough to take Money, had they had Provi- fions. It is all Plowed Land hereabouts, but Seva Gi commonly reaps the Harved, leaving hardly fo much to the Tillers as will keep Life and Soul together.

We found them all in Arms, not fuffering their Women to ftir out of the Town Unguarded to fetch Water, being accuftomed to continual Alarms; which cautioufnefs obliged them to ufher me into the Market-place, by a fmall Party which lighted on me in their Rounds ; when I fent my Gttlleon Peon, one of our Guides, with' his Mailers Chitty^ or Pafs, to the Governor, who received it kindly, and gave me leave to be my own Qnartermafter (little Complements being expected from Soldiers My Company, as welLas my felf, being Tired, and now ftiff with a little Reft allowed them till the return of the ?eon, we were not wil ling to be at more pains to feekfor a better Inn, than what a fakkr had taken up before us; but we rouzed a Lion, who had juft been lain afleep with Bang, who opened with fuch a Clamour, that I was afraid it would have brought all the Watch ajbout us, had they not been in the fame tune, calling on one another, as Children when the Light is out, do for fear ; beating their Drums, and founding their Trumpets ( Shriller than the Mw.f, and more Tuneable) all Night long; by which means, and my Quarrelfome Inmate, I could compofe my felf to no Quiet; though for the latter, at length I thought of an Expedient, plying him vt'ixhArack till his Tongue re- folved its felf in Silence, which was much more grateful than his Bawling. The next Morning when Day had cleared our Eyefight, I faw the Idol, this Drunken Prieft Adored, hard by me, it was thick and ^ort. Carved in Stone, of a Monftrous Vifage, whisking his Tail ©ver his Head; ^the upper Parts to the Wafte,were Painted with Red j it infulted over another ugly Creature it trod on ; it was of a Sooty Colour, and Swam in flreamsof Oil; yet it called in a great many Devotes, who came to pay their Salams. I fent to the HavaUar, to know when he would Pafs us up the Gaot ; word was brought he was not awake, having been up all Night; in the interim therefore, I Walked about the Town, which is Crowded with People, but miferably Poor, and of no Note, were it not that Seva Gi Stables his choiceft Horfes here, for theconveni- ency of this Plain to fupply them with Hay and Corn, which cau- fes them to have the greater Force, and makes it the Refidence of an Havaldar, who is a kind of petty General: Changing the Town for the open Fields, I was led to a Grove of Mangoes and Thamarindsy at the end ot which, was a Mofque, and a great many Tombs of ex cellent Stone, Demolifhed; one of which they remember with Re - fpedi, by the Name of Melech-Bury y a great Warrior 5 however, that which pleafed me moft of all, wasafuddenfurprize, when they brought me to the wrong ilde of a pretty Square Tank, or Well, with a Wall ot Stone, Breaft high; where expediting to find it cove- red with Water, looking down five Fathom deep, I faw a clutter of Women, very Handfome, waiting the diftilling of the Water from its dewy fides; which they catch in Jarrs, and conftantly carrying u away, leave it only weeping: It is cut out of a firm Black Marble Rock up almoll to the Top, with broad Steps to go down.

When I came before the Governor, I found him in State, though under an Hovel; where were many Brachmlns with Accompt Books, writing at fome diftance; nearer, his Privy-Council, with whom he feemed to Advife: I was placed on his Left hand, and defired my Interpreter to acquaint him my Errand, withal intreating his Fa vour for my fecure pafTing the HUI: He made it a piece of difficulty, and .told me I muft return to Bimly for Orders, to whofe Havaldar he was accountable, not to him otGulleon; which was within half a days Journy from whence I fet forth. Hearing this I bore my felf as fedately as I could, having been informed of the advantage they take of a difturbed Countenance ; and fweetned him with his own Au thority being fufficient, telling him of his Mailer's Kindnefs to the Englijh, and their Friendfhip towards him; which worked him to a yielding Temper; yet he fcrupled my Canijier, or Trunk, might be lined with Pearl, my Horfe fold to the Enemy, hoping tofuckfome- what out of me; I replying, What I had brought were at his liberty to fearch, and that I went only on an amicable account to Cure a Sick Perfon, and fhould be as ready to ferve him, if required, his Fury was quite pawled 5 but perceiving an hungry look to hang on them all, and fufpediing left they fhould ferve me fome Dog-trick, I made a fmall Prefent, and he figning the Pafs, difmifled me with a Bundle of Fawn, the ufual Ceremony at Parting.

And now our mighty Task began to try our Feet, as well as weary our Eyes: I not caring to hazard my felf longer in my Palenkeen, alighted, and though I thought it a work impoflible to conquer, I put the beft face on it I could, tarrying till they were all together, the better to chear them.

A good Day coming, the Governor fent for me to Vifit his Lady in the Haram, which was oppofite to a Chamber he fate in, Accom panied only with one pretty Wanton Boy, his Only Son by this Woman; upon which account he had the greater kindnefs for her: An Old Gentlewoman with a Tiffany Vail, made many trips, being, I fuppofe, the Governant of the Womens Quarters; at laft I was called a.nd admitted with my Linguift. At our being ready to enter, Hie Clapped with her Hands to give Notice; when we were led through a long dark Entry, with Dor mitories on both fides, the Doors of which Creeked in our paflage ( but I was cautious of being too Circumfped: } till we came to a» aiery Choultry ; where was placed a Bed hung with Silk Curtains; to which being brought,! was Commanded to place my felf clofe by it, from whence I might conveniently Difcourfe and Feel her Pulfe, putting my Hand under the Curtains. It was agreed among them to impofe upon me; wherefore at firft they gave me a Slaves Hand, whom I declared to be Sound and Free from any Difeafe, nothing contradiding the true Tenor and Rythme of Puliation 5 when they began to be more ingenuous, telling me, it was done to try me: Then was given me another Hand, which demonftrated a weak languid Conftitution; and colledfcing the Signs and Symptoms, I feared not to giv.e Sentence \ which met with their Approbation, and fo I was fent back the fame way I came. The Caun had been acquainted with what had pafled, and feemed pleafed ; whereupon I mud vifit the Haram again the next day to Bleed another of his Wives, he being tolerated Four, though he keeps more than Three hundred Concubines.

If the latter was not feafible, it was i vain to propofeany thing in relation to the former, for that all Ac- cefs was flopped if the Low Lands were not cleared 5 the Havaldars being unconfcionable irt their Cuftoms, and without doubt would interrupt what might be ferviceable to their Enemies, or brine pre. judice to their Prince ; whereas were the Ways free, it would enrich tiisjageah beyond )the Bunder at Surat , and tie the Englijh to a per petual Truce, who were known in thefe Parts addided to Traffick and Friends to Peace: He asked further. How far we defired to ex tend this Liberty ?

This being the fubftance of our Difcourfe, after he had related the Bufineft to his Council (he replied ) he would intimate what might be effeded in ir, to the Prefident, in anfwer to his Letter.

Having tarried now till the Rains had made their firft onfet Four- Dungenefs ano- teen days together, with horrid Thunder ; at the end thereof I fet ^ Heathen apart a day to take notice of the adjacent Rarities ; among which is ane ' a City called Dmgenefs, of like Antiquity and Workmanfhip, as Canorein, cut out of a Mountanous Rock, with a Temple and other fpacious Halls, by no means inferior to it both for Water and other Refrefhments, and much more entire; Time having not dealt fo cruelly with it, but the Lines of its ruined Beauty are ftill legible, though in old Charadiers; however it is left a defolate Habitation for Batts and Wafps; to difturb which it is dangerous, being over grown and defperately revengeful, following their Aggreflors till they have Whealed them into Contrition for their unadvifed Provo cation : To be out of the Noife of thefe buzzing Hornets, and to fe- cure our felves from the furprize of any difturbed Idolater, who might bellow the report of our being here, we hafted to the fafer Plain, and ended the reft of the day in a pleafant Garden, on the brink of the River which glides hence to Surat. The Governor of the Gur hearing T was preparing for to return The Requefi to Bomhaim, requefted before my departue to accept of my choice, of the Govet- either to afcend the Gur^ or elfe to meet him at his Garden below, ^ being theprefcribed Limits of his Walk: I fignified my readinefs to Afcent!'^ comply with the former, wherefore he fent Four VaknkeenSy his Kinfman, an Ingenuous Mogul, and his Brother to attend me. We Travelled Two Miles before we came to the Foot of it, where The Suburbs is a Garifon, or Fortified Townj walled with ftrong Chockies, or aflidcer tothe Watches, and a Troop of Five hundred Horfe, and as many Camels Caftle, of War; here are great Stacks of Hay and Corn, all their Droves of Beafts being ftieltered here anights. Seva Gi has diftrefled this often, and put them to the rout; but that, whofe Top we are endeavouring to gain, is inacceflible, unlefs by Seven winding Gates, which are ve ry ftrong, and able to clear one another as they rife, the Way being lined with Murtherers, and they themfelves defended with good Pieces of Ordnance: The laft is a Piece of excellent Work and Strength, and the place filled with Soldiers. Hence it is painful Riding, and requires a ftrong Back to keep The Hill i*n r State in a Palenkeen, it being carried almoft bolt upright, over ^Seven buC ilippery Marble fteps, cut out of the fhining Rock, as Imooth as Gates! 6 Glafs, and refleding the Sun-beams as much; After we had mounted near an Hundred Stairs, we were received into the Neck of the Caftle, which is collared about with a Wall, rather to keep them from falling down, than needful to prevent Aflailants; from whence an eafy Afcent leads to a Level, which is the Circus to train the In fantry ; where are confpicuous Tombs of their former Kings, being firmly Built, and a Mofque of poliihed Marble, which on Feftivals only they repair unto: No Houfes here are able to refift the Storms of Wind, or the Suns Heat, for which conveniency they have made the Eaftern fide of the Hill moft Inhabited, it ferving inftead136 A Defcripion of Surat Letter HI. of a Bank ; where they live in little low Huts, the Governor's not exceeding in height, (though a pretty neat Dwelling, fenced with Trees, no where elfe to be found ) who had expeded me Two whole Hours; but being impatient of delayjand the Sun growing too hot, he betook himfelf to his Haram^ having ordered his Kinfman ( whofe Civil Deportment met with his Commands) to Entertain me; heij but Poor ( fo that he threatens the Nahoh to turn Fakier ) yet Ge nerous, of a free open Temper, neither Jealous nor Lazy, as the Moors moft are; but applying himfelf to feveral HandicraftSjWhich he has learned of the Europeans ; he is learned too in the Perfian and Ara- lick Languages, though not to Vain-glory ; being fo Humble, Face tious, and Merry, that nothing but Spight and Envy can difagree with him : His Name is Nijhamheak ; fuch another I have not met with, fo general a lover of Franks ; which he fpecified in an efpe- cial manner to me, receiving me in an Airy Banquetting-houfe^ Embelliflied and Adorned on purpofe; and notwithftanding the Go vernor's Son was to pay his Compliments, would not fuffer me to give him Place, but diverted me with feveral Interludes of Morifct Dancing.

Wherefore the 22 d of May I left them, and took my Way by Nunny Gaot, or the Little Hill in refpeA of the other, which we faw mounted a prodigious height above us: Hither I came by twelve a Clock at Noon, a far fhorter and eafier Way than the other : It is ten Courfe from feneah l wherein we travelled between a Couple of Seva Gis Caftles; and overlooking the Gaot, is a third very like 7^ neahGur , which hailed us; I fent one to anfwer them, but kept on my Courfe till I came to the Gaot, where I was conftrained to bellow more time than I was willing, 500 Oxen laden with Salt ( which is fo precious up the Country, as to be.proverbially preferred to Bread, they faying, Whofe Salt they eat, as we, Whofe Bread^) flopping the Gap ; but with a little Intreaty, after an hour's (landing ftill in the Sun, I got them, by fending my Peons, to defift below, till we had widen'd the Pais above; after which it is feafible,'being-fup- plied at fit diftances with charitable Citterns of good Water, and to wards the bottom adorned with beautiful Woods, delighting as well as refreming us with the Shade : By Sunfdt I was in the Plain, where an honeft Sulidar that took ofThis Liquor, let me pafs without tr6u- bld, being more like a Scout tharra Sfet-W$tch. Nor do I believe the Mogul's Army dare venture.to advance be tween thefe Streights, which are fo well maintain'd; but farther North the Hills feem to (loop more to the Plain, and it may be that Way they may pafs; though this Way be tolerable for Caphalas and Merchants who have their Pafsports. We reckon to have meafured this Day Fifteen Courfe, moft in 'the Heat of the Day, to the fide of a poor Village called Wefmre, where we refted under a Tree, the Coo/ifj being unprovided for; iior could they # purchafe any thing here, the Inhabitants being hared out of their Wits, miftrufting even their own Countrymen as well as Strangers, living as it were wildly, betaking themfelves to the Thick ets and Wildernefles among the Hills, upon the approach of any new Face ; for my Horfe by chance breaking loofe, fet a whole Gom or Town upon the hoof, they^thinking^rdv^e^s Lufcarry at hand; thus unhappily live thefe, a Prey to every one. The Clouds had fpread ^hemfelves over the Tops of the Hills, that they feemed to make a Neplus ultra, or the World's-End. The next Day at Twelve a Clock at Noon we ftruck into our old Road' at Moorhar, from whence before we were mifguided ; we packed hence by Five in the Afternoon, and left our Burnt Wood on the Right-hand, but entred another made us better Sport, deluding us with falfe Flafhes, that you would have thought the Trees on a Flame, and prefently, as if untouch'd by Fire, they retained their wonted Verdure.

Carmr, what remains of it, is under the New Conqueft of Sevn G 'ty being lately, with Anchola^ Pundit } Cuderah and Semipr, brought under (though all of them very Strong Places): At which time the Envjijh were moulding a Fortification, dr Houfe of Defence, for their own fafety, when by the Afliftance of a Small Pink they defended themfelves from all Hoftile Mifchances; and though their Town was wholly laid in Alhes, yet they built this their ftately Manfion Four-fquare, guarded by Two Bulwarks at the Commanding Corners of the Houfe: In the mean while Seva Gi made himfelf Mafterof Carwar Caftle, together with the reft, the Inhabitants flying to the Woods and Hills for fhelter: Thus it continues not without daily difturbance from thefe SyIvans and Mountaineers, the commiferated Subjeds of Vifiapour, who often make an Head and fall upon them; by which means the Government is unfetled, and the Governors fhift from Place to Place.

Seva in his Government imitates the Moors in this, appointing a diftind: Governor here for Town and Caftle, and over all thefe a Commander with a Flying Army, who is Superintendent: Into Places of Truft and Authority he puts only Brachmns, or their Sub- ftitutes, viz.

At Night we were alarmed by a paultry.Fellow that took our Houfe for his Sanctuary, being forced to it for his own Security; the Soldiers afliiming great licenfe for want of Pay, and the Cofferies for want of Visuals, fo that every one walks the City with his naked Sword in his Hand for his own defence at Evening ; and now within Doors, and in a Private Houfe, we were forced to make our Arms our Pillows. The next day we pafled the Bar for Fingula; half way we put In our going afhore to refrefh our Men, and at Ten in the Morn fet out again; by J? we Twelve we came clofe up with a Malabar that had feifed a 6roh, but /^pLate^ , we foon.made him yield his Prize to engage with us; which they did briskly for Two hours, driving to board us, cafting Stink-pots among us, which broke without any.Execution, but fo frighted our Rowers, that we were forced to befevere to reftrain them; they plied their Chambers and fmall Shot, and flung Stones, flounfliing their Targets and Darting Long Lances; they were well Manned in a Boat ten times as big as our Barge, and at leaft Sixty fighting Men befides Rowers j we had none to manage our fmall Gun, the Gunner runningThey carefs us afhore at Vin- gula.

The Spectators of this Encounter were the Dutch Chief and Go. vernor on the Shore, and a Ship of a dozen Guns in the Road; by Three we came a-(hore with flight Hurts, but cried up mightily by the People, who are continually infefted by thefe Pirats without any Refiftance : The Dutch received us at their Factory very kindly, whofe Houfe is handfomely feated a Mile up a Shallow River, (except at Spring Tides, when lufty Ships may come up) ; it is built upon Ar ches Geometrically,by the prefent Chief,in the Figure of a Roman T, all of Solid Stone; it is Trenched with a Square Trench, and de fended by a Platform of Two Great Guns on every fidCjandTwo Great Bulwarks, bearing Smaller Guns at the Two Corners of the Houfe; the Front is Italian Fafhion, pafling to it over a Draw-Bridge; at Night we walked into the Town, part of it lately deAroyed by the Syddy; where was a Buzzar, and a neat Choultry of the Dutch's, and beyond a Garden watered by a Frefh Stream, where we bathed; After Supper they treated us with the Dancing Wenches, and good Scops of Brandy and Delps Beer till it was late enough. We went next day to the Governor,who Complimented us highly; he is under the Tyrannical Government of SevaGi, where all Bar barous Cuftoms areexercifed ; and here it is permitted the Women not only to burn with their dead Husbands, but here are many Mo numents raifed in honour of them.

We were carried by the Tide of the People that bore that way out of this place, to a large oblong flone Tank, with Defcents to go down all about it; in the ijiiddle a neat Pagod fupported on Four Marble Pillars; here during this Feftival at Evenings, are blazing a Lecque of Lamps.

By which, Bullul Caun forefeeing the approaching Storms, was too wary to ftay the breaking of them over his Head, but fairly fieps forth to prevent them: Wherefore furprizing Sergi Caun and Tim Naig, as they were moving to join with fome of the forwardeft of the Duccaneesy the firft fled, not without lofs, the other was environ'd by Bullul Caun^s Army, and compelled to (land it out, till the Ca mels of War, who carry fmall Petareroes, flew the greateft part of them, and timi Naig himfelf was trodden to Death under his Ele phants Feet, whereupon an eafy Vidiory enfued, the reft yielding when their General was flain; who is not much lamented by the Nobles of Canora, whofe Greatnefs he diminifhed by cutting them off upon fmall Sufpicions, and advancing in.their (leads inferior Per- fons to great Employments; confining the Princefs-Mother with her Son to a Penfion, and that but ordinary.

The Boy Shot it in the Night from a Choufepr Eftarzo^s it came to Drink, fuppofing it to h|ve been a Deer; the firft Shot was that under the Shoulder, which made her Spring Three times an incredible Height^at the laft of which fhe fell into the Choufe from whence Ihefaw the Flafh, where with the Englifh Boy were a Comly, and a Cmly Boy of Eight Year old, afleep a little on one fide; fhe pawed the Straw with her Feet, while all but the Child afleep fled ; but being wrung by her Pain, fhe foon left the place with an horrible Noife that made the Woods tremble, all which awaked not the Lad, nor had it any Harm. In this interval, the Englifh Youth Charged again with a couple of Slugs, and tracing the Blood, as fhe was making at him, difcharged through the Brain-pan, at which fhe was quiet; but to make fure, he made another fhot at her, which he believed was that in the Leg: All this time the Moon was Obfcured and Cloudy ; the Comhy that had left him and his Son, at length came with a many-more, calling Fringi, the Term, they have for Europe-Mm and Franks ; the Boy was walking about, fearingto venture within reach, till at laft laying afide his well-advifed Suipicion, he approaching, found the Terror of the Wood Slain, Difrobedcl its Royal Hide, Two Bones of the Bignefs and Figure of aLevator, prefented themfelvesto our vieW, that had no Connexi on with the other Bones, but wholly immerfed in the Flefh per fy- Jarcafin &gt; in the ends of each Peroral , and the Three circumducing Mulcles, towards the joining of the Shoulder-blades, and the'upper Bones of the Fore-feet, commonly called Shoulder-bones; of thefe there goes a Story handed by Tradition, as that Licking the Right Shoulder it appeafes Hunger, the Left it whets it where thefe Bones he; ^but probable enough it is, that Nature added thefe for its greater Strength; Ihe Entrails were little variable, but the Heart was nighty, and the Liver (they fay } had as many Lobes as that was Years old, which were Six and an half, like to a Foxes. The Chief, to encourage the Lad, told him, That though he were a Boy, he had done a Manly Adfaon, and therefore according to the Cuuom of the Country, in prefence of all his Admirers, he plucked off his own Coat, which was Venetian Cloath of Silk and Silver, and gave it him. The Great Omhrahs always do the like upon any hazardous Atchievracnts,: Monkies the common Re* pafl: of the Tigre. iP A Relation of the Cmm 177 Atchievments, and if Wounded, throw them their Sallies and Pa- Chap.

It is memorable what is attefted, by thefe Woodmen, of the Tigre, that when he intends to Prey on the Monkies ( with which thefe Woods abound) he ufes this Artifice or Stratagem; the Monkies at his firft approach give warning by their confufed Chattering, and im mediately betake themfelves to the higheft and fmallefl Twigs of the Trees; when the Tigre feeing them out of his reach, and fenfible of their fright, lies Couchant under the Tree'and then falls a Roar ing, at which they trembling let go their hold, and tumbling down he at leifure picks them up to fatisfy his Hunger : They are his ac- cuftomed Repaft, feldom making Man his Meal, and they are judged ( as St. Paul's Barhartans did him ) guilty of fome horrid Crime that fuch Vengeance overtakes; the Woods and Mountains yielding them variety of other Food. The Tigre is dull Scented, and not long Nimble, Three Leaps Tiring him, otherwife it's probable he would make morehavock than he does. The She brings forth but once in Twelve Years, and then but a Tingle Cub ; they are Ingend- ring Three Months, in which time their Fury as well as Luft rages upon one another; thus has Providence fuppreffed the Growth of this mafterlefs Creature: Befides, if the Proverb be true, the Bitch brings forth but once in her life, or very rarely more ; Iteratus baud partus leance contigit, notwithflanding /Elian fays otherwife in his 4 lih. de H'tflorih Animalium. The moft frequent in thefe Woods are the leflef fort of Tigres fpotted like a Leopard ; thefe are Cruel and Ravenous, but more Fearful than the others are; that Monkies are their Food, the very Ordure declares fcattered up and down, where is vifible the fhagged Coats or Hair of thefe Creatures. Many of thefe Apes fell by our hands, either for being noify and impertinent fpoiling our Game, or provoking us by their conftant purfuingus, being of the largeft fize, upon which account many came under my Knife ; opening them I found and obferved their fe- minary Veflels turgid, their Virge White and Nervous. To Kill one of thefe the Natives hold Piacular, calling them Half Men, faying 1 , once they were Men, but for their Lazinefs had Tails given them and Hair to cover them: Towards Zeilon they are Deified; at the Straits of Baligaot they pay them Tribute. Bamboos make the grofs of the Woods, which are High, Taper ing, Thorny Trees, incumbred from the Roots with abundance of fhrubby ones, the Bark Green and jointed with the Wood, the Branches are Tapering and inclining, fending from every Joint fprouts of the fame form, leafed like long Five-fingered Grafs, the Body is thick and ftrait; their ufe is for Staffs, Poles, or Rafters for Houfes, and Fences; being flit they are hollow and ferve for Laths.

Et Lohel S'tluiuay aut Caffia purgatrix Arahm Carohis fim'tlis. In the Groves about Carwar grows Caffia Lignum, Xyld-Cafia, or Baftard Cinamon ; the Trees are large as a Pear-Tree, a Leaf of the like bignefs, but ribbed like our Plantain, the main Bark and Body like other Trees, of no different Smell or Tafle till dried, when it bites, and fmells Spicy; the Leaf bruifed and chewed fmellslike ftrong Cinamon, and upon the Tongue is as hot as a Clove; the Bark of the fmall Branches alfo when Green alters nothing in Tafle from Cinamon, but dried is more flimy, and is very good Caffia Lh- mm: It bears little longWhitifli Flowers, of no Smell nor Tafte but the Leafs of the Branch that bear them have a more Aromatick Tafle. The Thamarhd Tree hath a fmall Leaf like a Vetch, bears the Fruit in a Cod like a /rmr^ Bean, wherein is the Pulp, inclofing the Stones and Fibres; it is a great fpreading Tree,' the Body thick, the Bark rough and brownifh, bears its Fruit in March ; the IntlmsM on it, and grow Fat with it; they have not the Art to preferveit with Sugar, but Salt it up : This is Siliqua Arahica too, but not Ni gra, as the Caffia Fiflula is. Teke by the Portugucze, Sogwan by .the Moors, is the firmed Wood they have for Building, and on the account it refills Worms and Pu- trefadion, the bed for that purpofe in the World; in Height the Lofty Pine exceeds it not, nor the. Sturdy Oak in Bulk and Sub- ftance; the knotty Branches which it bears aloft, fend forth Green Boughs more pliant, in Form Quadrangular, fed within by a Spongy Marrow or Pith, on which at the Joints hang broad, thin, and po rous Leafs, fending from the main Rib fome Fibres, winding and fpreading like a Fan. This Prince of the Indian Foreft was not fo attradive, though mightily glorious, but that at the fame time I was forced to take notice of the creeping Cow-Itch, raifing its felf upon the Shrubs and Under-woods, there fpending in lafcivious Tv\ ines its Verdure, leaving nothing but withered Stalks to be the Props of its brindled Offspring, which is a fmall Cod covered with a ight and tickling Down; within, it includes in four Cavities, four 1 peeked Beans; the fallen Leafs make fome appearance of a Nobler Stock, having a Countenance like thofe of Lawrel; the Root is dif ficult to find, being mixed among other Trees, like our White Briony. , Here grows Mux Vomka on a Tree of indifferent bignefs, in a round Shell as big as an Orange, filled with White Pulp, wherethe Nuts are lodged. .

Ginger comes up like our Gentian; they pickle it well, but cannot preferve k with Sugar. Potatoes are their ufual Banquet. And to give the Soil its due Praife, it obeys in all things the fir ft Commandment, Increafe and Multiply. For thefe Bleffings, as if Men were to lofe their Reafons, and fink A Feaft of below Brutes by a bafe Superftition, they are ready to acknowledge a Stock for a Deity, rather than to go without, infatuated by the Delufions of the Devil, being captivated at his Will; for wiiich caufe they not only make Oblations to him, but give up their Souls and Bodies to his Devotion: As might about this time have been be held at an Idol Worlhipof Priapm, (where the Women proflitute themfelves to him, and receive the Pleafure of Copulation, all that while being as it were pofTefled ) at Semiffar, on the other fide of the Water from our Houfe, where he lay with Two and twenty, who reckon it a great Honour, and the Husband thinks himfelf happy in his Cornucopia. There are a fort of Jougies, Priefts fit for fuch a God, among the Linguits of this Country, who pradlife this daily; the Husbands entertain them courteoufly, walh their Feet, and the whole Family is at his Beck, as long as he (lays to do the Wife a Rindnefs. Others flalh themfelves with fharp Knives, and fuffer themfelves to be hooked by the Mufcles of the Back, and hang fo fome Hours • upon a Vow. Under the Banyan Tree, an Altar with a Dildo in the middle being ered:ed, they offer Rice and Cocoe-Nuts to the Devil, and joining fome fmalI Ladders together made of Ofiers, do the like; when the Gomcaror BaylifF of the Town takes a falched Knifp for Sacrifice in one Hand, and a Dunghil-Cock in the other, and cutting off its Head, fixes it at top of the Ladder, and fprinkling the Blood they all dance, and beat Brafs Pots with a great Shout, faying, The Devil wufl he pacified with Blood, God with Prayers. Some of thefe fell themfelves to Wickednefs, and thefe muft be The Dregs of endued with the Spirit of Fafcination, always nouriftiing a Familiar ckfmvor^ in their Families, which they keep moftly in the forms of Snakes or think they do Serpents, appearing to them upon their Command; and undergo fiery Afflictions to have the molt hurtful Devil; and as they wreak their Malice more powerfully , efteem themfelves more in favour with their Grand Mafter: Thefe are the Dregs of the People, who are full of Envy and 111 Defigns, who glory in their Shame of In cantations and Charms: Such as thefe are thofe that out of Fear pray to the Devil and Evil Spirits, faying, God mil do them no harm.

In their Hooly, which is at their other Seed-time, I obferved they cut a whole Tree down to the Roots, and lopped off the under- Branches till it became ftrait, when leaving the upper Boughs, they fhoulder'd it with great Clamours, the Brachmin beginning a Note which they all followed: Thus they brought it into the Pale of their Pagods, before which, eafing it down at one end, the foremoft made a Salam y and hoifted it vv ith the fame Noife again, and about they went three or four times repeating the fame; which being finiflied, the Arch-Brachmin digs an hole, and baptizes it with Holy Water, where in they fix the Tree, crowning it with Flags aloft, and about the Bo dy up to the Green Boughs they bind Wifps of Straw, to which they put Fire, and look earneftly on the Flame, according to the Afcentof which the Brachmin pronounces his Auguries^ then they offer Rice and Flowers, painting their Bodies with the Arties, depart ing with a Mace of Flowers carried before them, beating of Drums and a great Noife.

But to be clear, fe* ut Fama ad liquid urn producatur, let us confider, Wretche^dcj 16 that thefe Underlings of the People that do thefe Services to the work by the Devil, or are faid fo to do, may be afperfed : For the Brachmins, and Devil, or no. other the Purer Sort, as they account themfelves, may defame them only, becaufe ihedding of Blood is horrible to t(iem, and therefore Diabolical: Befides, thofe Difeafes that are faid to be Devils put into one another, ( which as many as I have met with, I have been cu- rioufly inquilitive of) their Phcenomenaes or Energies are difcufled by Natural Caufes, and as often cured by Natural Means; but on the contray, it is allowed where they refift them, it is fufpicious: And the Devil without doubt cannot eafier work on any, than the Weak and Simple, (wherefore he chofe the Woman, not the Man ) and upon that account may probably delude and overawe thefe People, that give themfelves up to him wholly out of Fear, having not fo much Virtue, Fortitude, and Cunning, to refift and check their own Lufts, as the Wifer fort. As for the vifible appearance of a Devil or Daemon (which they fay is common among them, by thofe that fee it) I am convinced it may be credible; but in the mean while. Rage and Melancholy Madnefs, aflifted by the Infernal Pow er, may create great Illufions to a Fancy fitted for fuch an Opera tion, and they may think they fee things which in reality are not fo.

Elocution, Phyfick, Metaphyficks, are not out oi their Element: Their Philofophers maintain an Ari~ ftotelian Vacuity ; nor sre they quite ignorant of Medicks, though Anatomy is not approved, wherein they lean too much on Traditi on, being able to give a very (lender account Of the Rational Part thereof. In what Perfe&lt;9:ion Mufick (lands ( as I am no competent Judge ) I could never give my Ears the trouble to examine, it Teem ing loud and barbarous; yet they obferve Time and Meafure in their Singing and Dancing, and are mightily delighted with their Tum bling and Noife. They as much diflike our fliriller Mufick, hardly allowing our Wayts fit to play to Bears, and our Stringed Inftruments Urike not their hard-to*be-raifed Fancies; but our Organs are the Mufick of the Spheres with them, charming them to liften as long • as they play. Arithmetick being the mod profitable Science, is the beft underftood by them; to which they have a Natural Propenfity, and will in a trice, without the help of Pen or Ink call up the dif- ficulteft Sums, and never paufe upon it. In fome Places they write on Cocoe-Leafs dried, and then ufe an Write on Iron Style; or elfe on Paper, when they ufe a Pen made with a Reed, for which they have a Brafs Cafe, which holds them and the Ink too' always fluck at the Girdles of their Scrivans, Among thefe are enrolled the Muttames, louries , or Pilgrims, who lead a Beaftly Life, having all things common, and are courted jngtT™ wherever they come, nor do they ever depart, without leaving a Stain to their Profeffiort; When they eafe Nature they fcrape an Hole, as Dogs or Cats do, to bury their Excrements, to prevent breeding ot Infects. Thefe are covered, the fird with a White Sheet, andA Special Chorog Letter IV. and carry Perfuming Pots, and Blefsallasthey pafs; the others have a Snapfack, a Mirchal , and a patch'd Goat, rambling up and down as the Fakiers ; the firft are buried with their Heels upwards and Heads downwards; the others fometimes buried, fometimes burnt. At the Heel of thefe may be reckoned the Bengal Juglers, Moun tebanks, and Conjurers, as a)To the Dancing People ,• thefe are Va grants, that travel to delude the Mobile by their Hocus Pocus Tricks ( living promifcuoufly like our Gypfies*) ; among whom I faw one who fwallowed a Chain, fuchas our Jacks have, and made it clink in his Stomach; but pulling it out, it was not fo pleafant to the Spectators (being moftly Ladies, for whofe Diverfion he was brought) they puking when it was accompanied with a filthy roapy Slaver.

I was promifed to fee a Fellow that caft up his Tripes by his Mouth, Stomach and all, (hewing them to the Beholders ; but he was excu- fed, having fome time allowed him to prepare himfelf for it: In his ftead were brought me two; the firft of which, by Sudion or draw ing of his Breath, fo contracted his lower Belly, that it had nothing lefttofupport it, but fell flat to.his Loins, theMidnfT being forced into the Thorax, and the Mufcles of the Abdomen as clearly marked out by the ftifF Tendons of the Linea Alha, as by the moft accurate Diflc&amp;ion could be made apparent, he moving each Row like living Columns by turns. The ^Etiology whereof I think to be this; that while all the Contents of the Belly are moved upwards,all Refpiratidn is expelled, only the voluntary Motion of the Animal Spirits ads upon the Nerves (the Mind or Soul commanding them ) while the Vital or Natural are compelled to the contrary. After this I faw another Fellow of a good Habit of Body, that had taught himfelf by ufe to deprefs his Sternum, with the Serratus Tofiicus Inferior, Sacro lumhus, and Triangular Mufcles, fo that the Cartilaginous Subftanceof the Ribs, which Anatomifts feparate for Difledion of the Thorax, and throw it back over the Face, by this means was crowded in, that it made a notable Cavity as deep as the Spine would fuffer; in the mean while the Man was almoft ftrangled, as if prcfled to death ; for under this Conftraint neither he nor the tormer could take their Breath, yet remained' fo fome time: Which may be a vifible fnftance that divers Urinators may continue a long Ipace, being inured from their Infancy to keep under Water.

For vending, Stones of fix Grains and under, to one and a half, are beft. ^ ' ' ' ' ' For Trial of a Diamond, take a Pointed Diamond, fuch as Glaziers life, try it on any Stone but a Diamond, and it will cut the fame.

A Foil to be fct under a thick Table Diamond, is to be made with Black Ivory and MafHck, picked and made very clear, with a very little Oyl of Maftick to incorporate them. Black Ivory and Turpentine heated on the Fire is good, but the former is better. For a thin Table, Black Ivory fcraped very fine is good; or take a lit tle of the'faid Ivory with a little Oyl of Maftick, and dry the fame; or Ivory with a little Gum ; fair Water is alfo very good. If you fell a thin Diamond that hath high Bifalls, then you may fet it upon full fcraped Ivory, which graceth the Play of the Stone. A Rofe Diamond that is very thick, it's good to fet it clofe upon the Ivory, and it will play very well; or Black Velvet is good under a thin Table-Diamond, fcraped as you do Lint. The R V B r. There are four forts of Oriental Rubies ; that which is the hardeft, the beft, and faireft Colour, if it be very fair and cut Diamond-Cut, is no lefs efteemed than a Diamond for the Weight, ( or of the fame Weight), but it is rare to fee fuch an one. The fecond fort of Ruhy is White, Oriental, and Hard, which alfo is of good efteem, if cut of a Diamond-Cut, but not of fo high Price as the perfect Red Ruby; but yet if it be in Perfedion, 'tis very rare, be- eaufe there are but few of this fort.

The Goloomy Shaw ftaid at the Garden without the City fome days at the Expence of theCaun, till things could be provided for his Re ception, which was thus ; Early in the Morning the loud Trumpets and Drums gave notice that the Caun and all his Troops were ready to take Horfe, and waited the Attendance of all Ranks to the chief Moftfue?thence to the Garden; where coming and feeing theMef- fenger with the King's Letter advanced on the Top of hisTurbat, with his Back towards the Caun, he alights, and after Three Obey- fances and Thrice kiffing the Ground, he approaches and takes it in his Hand, fealed up in a Sarhaff Bag, or Cloth of Gold , and firft kifling it, gives it to the Mullah, or Chief Prieft, when he retires to Prayers, ancfVeftshimfelf with the Robe of Honour; in which time all feat themfelves in a decent Pofture, and at his appearance rife till the Mullah have read the Emperor s Pleafure, when every otie pays him their Congratulations, and after a Difh of Coho or Tea, mount ing, accompany him to his Palace; the Ships in the Road on this Occafion difcharging their great Guns, and the feveral Forts and Blockhoufes faluting him as he pafles: Where alighting , a Noble Banquet, and truly Perfian, wasufliered in, to which the fly were invited with the reft; who durft not but be prefent, though on ly to make their Honours, and return; for they will not eat with any but their own Tribe, left they ftiould be defiled: Yet here they live not fo exactly up to their Pythagorean Rule, as they of Guzerat do, though the very next Neighbours to them, coming from the Pro vince of Sinda; for thefe indulge themfelves in Goats-Flefli, Sheep, Pullen, and almoft every thing but Cows-Flefh, for which they wil- lingly pay j50T/wwWf Yearly, to fpare them alive; and for this reafon is it the Shambles have none; but of every thing elfe, both Flefli and Fifli, here is as great Plenty as the World has befides.

The Fury of thefe were not over at our Arrival; to avoid which I was forced in the beginning of May to betake my felf to Ajfeen, a Country Village Three Miles from Gomhroon, than which it is not much better, only remoter from the Sea, wherefore it labours under the Incommodity of a ftifling Air, it being fo near the Hills that the free Blafts are thereby intercepted ; only it enjoys a greater benefit of limpid Water, for which it is highly valuable; and by the In- dudry of the Hinds fome things do fprout here, and the Date-Trees are nourifhed by the unwearied drawing of Water, which flourifli the better for their Pains.

Beginning to fet forward, neither Trad: nor Road was followed all being covered with Sand ; but our Guides fleered by their own Experience; this was not fo comfortable, to behold nothing but a Sea of Sand; for now we began to turn our back upon the Gulf, and deer a more Northern Courfe,from whence to reflect whatSudenance this barren Earth could produce, that, Ihould our Stores fail, we might want; yet even for this Jealoufy we had not the leadfliadowof Reafon, for had we been lefs provided we might have met with Plenty, every one driving to Vend us Nccedaries, to the no fmall encreafe of my amazement how they came by them. After we had waded through Two Pharfangs of this Defolate Way, we began to Clamber up thofe Hills, which feem hanging over the Road of Qomlroon^ now beating the Hoof on more folid Rocks: In this Paflage we could here and there defcry fome Groves of Palms whofe Fruit were tindured with a Cherry Red, the condant fore runner of their full Maturity; at which time they look for the fame Unhealthinefs we do in our Autumn; though I find them not fo fu- perditioudy adduced to Symbols, as the Egyptians to their Hiero- glyphicks, yet they exprefs the Year by this Tree; becaufe this Tree, fay they, of all others alone ( which I before noted of the Coco-Nut Tree, and therefore I think it a kind of Palm) at every appearance of the New Moon procreates a frefli Branch, by which Twelve Produdions the whole Year is refembled and compleated ; the Trees are Tall and Slender, bearing their Boughs all atop, like a fhady Tuft, fome danding bolt upright, and others fpread abroad, with others flagging and ready to give way to the Birth of more; when they are Young and in their Infancy, they no fooner fprouc up but the prickly Leafs guard its tender Head, which is of a pithy fubdance, and when Wounded fpoils the Trees Growth, fo that it Dies; but while it efcapes that danger, it rifes by degrees after the former Order, the under Branches bowing Archwifeto their upflart Youngders; the Leafs are fet in Rows like Ribs to a great Spine, aridng from a Circular Ba(e, till it end in a iharp Point; under thefe Boughs the mighty Branches hang full of Dates in Cluders, and which is more than fay fo, The more they r Burthened better do they Thrive^ Like deprefsd Virtue better kept alive.

Of thefe Trees there are Male and Female,and which is worthy our Notice, the Female Palms ( which only Bear) will not Bring forth before they are Impregnated at the Roots with the Seed of the Male, firft pounded into Meal and fprinkled about them; which how true Idifpute not; but certainly Tradition has confirmed the Practice, and they are not to be perfuaded to negled the Cuftom. u « Inthemidftof this Days A/«»/^/, among the Mountains we palled 'eiiGate. by the Mouth of an horrid Cave; where they entertain Travellers with Tragick Stories, and a Legend of Fables, as that it is the Road to Hell ; for, fay they, whoever Enters never Returns; as if thence had arofe the Proverb, No Redemption from the Shades ; or that of the Poet, Facilis defienfus Ave mi; Sed revocare gradus, hie labor, hoc opus eft Eafy the Defcent'sto Hell, but back again » Our Heps to call, this is the Work, the Paid.

The next Morn we were waited on by the Country Women bringing us Cheefe, and Butter made before our Eyes, with no other Churn than a Goatskin, in which they fhook the Milk till Butter came; Fi(h, Roots, and Herbs, with all forts of Pullen: In thefe Two Munfels we only meet with thefe Servitors, in other PJa- ces Men appear alone, not allowing their Women that Freedom i but were they no more tempting than thefe Swains, they'd have fmall caufe for the Reftri&amp;ion; for they are Strapping Sunburnt Lafles, with little more Cloaths on than a dark coloured Smock, or Frock ; and for their Meen it is not enticingthefe bring us Water to Drink out of their Tanks , newly filled , which was Thick, Troubled, and Slimyj for which reafon the Vapours, or rather Fumes from the Sun's violence, were very Offenfive, and the more irkfome, becaufe we were conflrained to tarry here another Night, for that the River Ruie Conna Shure, or Salt-Water, was now over- flown by the Waters falling from the Mountains beyond the Banks to that excefs, that it could not be Forded by Travellers, and the Streani ran with that Rapidnefs, that it was unfafe to venture over till the defcending Catarads had left off pouring on the overfwell'd Brinks, and emptied themfelves into the wider Gulf, not many Leagues diftant hence. The Day after, as foon as we heard the Waters were abated, we fet forward, and found it true what had been reported ( Three Ca- fhalas not daring to pafs the Lake, where they had lain fome Days, till we had led the way ). It was fultry Hot when we aflayed to go, but Delays in this cafe were dangerous; befides, we were uncertain whether it would hold uplbould we tarry, which made us confide on our Guides, who gave us aflurance, that the Madhes were palTa- ble ; we were more troubled with Waves of Sand than Water, both which, by Rain, or Wind, keep on their Courfe with fome noifetill filenced in the Perfian Gulf.

Nor do the Publick Roads deny the Calamity of thofe Munfels, j ehmt which are frequently ftrewed with Bones of labouring Beafls, expi ring under their Burthens, many of which were frefh Examples of this Truth, lying reeking Carkafles in our Way from Goor Bazergum to Jehm, which is but Twelve Miles, where we were forced to ftay to get more Camels, for Three had failed us in this ConflicSt; and af» terwards with much Pain we meafured fix Miles more to Tangedelon % where we eafed our felves at a Caravan Ser Raw, near a Stream of li ving Water fweetly gliding through the middle of it, and walh'd H h x the '' I mm ■ 1 ; -11 1Shm Zwgee.

In this Plain the Heats increafed upon us fo, that we could not touch the Walls but they were like Fire, the Winds that fhould re- frefli us were ready to inflame us, nor was any thing cool but the Water, which they had kept in Earthen VefTels dipped in their Wells or Tanks, where being drowned they cameuplhivering cold, which was all the Comfort we received here; wherefore at Sun fet we made for Lhor, choaked withDuft and Heat; half-way, at a new Caravan Ser Raw, we encountred three Caphalaes laden with Dry Fruit for the Port: This was founded by the Overfeerof the Building of the Long-Bridge over the Lake leading to the Gulph, who raifed him- felf thereby, and begins (though covetous in other things ) to be- ftow his Mony on thefe Works, having laid the Foundation for ano ther at Sham Zangee. From this Place to Lhor the Ground is more Even, and fit for Cul tivation, the Husbandmen having planted their Cottages along the Valley, on each fide of a gliding Brook, here and there befet with Tamerhk Trees. About Nine in the Morning we came to Lhor, near Forty Mile from Sham TLangee. The Hollanders have here a neat, but fmall Dwelling, whither their Commodore comes fometimes: In this we defigned to have worn fome days away, but neither the Heat nor Musquitoes would let us reft long in this City ; wherefore defiring to fly from thefe, we changed our Camels for Mules, that we might make better fpeed than thefe flow Animals would endure; for thefe intemperate Seats were too^hot for us, fo that the fame Afternoon we mounted, and on Horfeback faw the remaining part of the City leading us on our Way.

Po is interpreted the Bafis, Xutal of the Hill j this Inn was a new flrong, fquare, large Inn ; the firft we ftabled, or rather fhut our Doors in a-Nights, it being Built after the bed Form, and Capacious of a great Number, both in the outward Square and inner Stables • to this belonged Three ftately Tanks with a deep Well, feme an Hundred Fathoms down to the Bottom, with a Pond, either to Wa ter or Walh the Qttel in, hard by it; the perfed proof of our be ing pafled the Sands, which hold not digging fuchadepth, this being White Marble; and the whole Plain promifed a more fruitful Clay. Hence to Bury metes out Twelve Miles more, where the beft Caravan Ser Raw is on all the Road, it being not only well Adorned with White facing Stone, but is both a Large and Convenient, as well as Stately Fabrick. Hard by this is a Peor, or Burying-place of one of their Pro phets, being a goodly Monument, with an School Founded in his Honour, and Endowed with a good Penfion for to maintain the Devotion of their Priefts. The next Mmfel we hardly Went, but Crept onward to, through almoft impaflable and dangerous Precipices, with all the heed imagi nable, lor a Trip here could not have been retrieved without the lofs of our Lives; but by the Divine Providence we came to Eonaru^ an Eight Cornered Eighteen Miles from Bury ; thereon an Hill are the remains of a regular Fortification, with a fupplimentof Outworks on every lide, without any Avenue, unlefs on one fide; between this Village and Bury, the Inhabitants reckon a many Ca- llles on the Mountains with large Tanks of Water, and Store-houfes for Provifions oi Corn, Cut out of the main Rocks with indefari- gable Co ft and Induftry, which Works were they to be begun now ( fay*they ) could not be Finiflied by the Experteft Artifts in Fifty Y ears.

Horns, fet up as the Trophies of their Skill in Shooting them ; and as a farther Argument of the cruel flaughter made among their Fore fathers, for more than Three Days Journy together, the Fields are every where filled with Graves. And now we began to be acquainted with the (hift they make for Water in thefe dry Countries, where there is little Rain, and no Rivu lets; they Dig for Springs, and when they have found one, they fol low the Water-Courfe which way it diredb under Ground, Hollow ing the Ground, and at every Thirty or Forty Yards, caft up a Mole-Hill, where they make a Pit to Ventilate and let in the Air to Purify the Water, as wellastoCleanfe the Channel, and this Courfe holds on many Tharfangs together for the advantage of the Vallies; and this I look upon to be as much the caufe of the Generation of the Bezoar-Stont in the Animals aforefaid, as the reaforts alledged thereby Bontiusht their Produdlion; for by the confent of all Phy- ficians, nothing contributes more to the Breeding of the Stone in Men, than fuch things as are Undigefted and create Obftrudi- nor can any thing be more Obftrudting than fuch Water as is ons drawn from Wells and deep Caverns, where the Sun has little influ ence, as we may have occafion to manifeft afterwards; and there fore we may probably Conjedture, thefe Unconcodted Waters to be a main inftrument of their production, fince where thefe are in ufe, this Accident is more general than in other places. From Bomru to Moufar, another Eight-fquare Caravan, are Fif teen Miles, fine, plain, and eafy way; near the Caravan Ser Raw \ks a pleafant Garden, theutmoft extent of the Caun of LhoSs Dominions on this Road. And as a Boundary thereto, is oppofed the fteepeft Hill we have yet met with, infomuch that we found it a notable Task to gain the Top by the Morning of the following Day, contenting our felves to fit down at Chawtalk, but Nine Miles from Bonaru , being advifed of a more troublefome Day's Journy ihzMunfel after this 5 not fo diffi cult for Accefs as this, but a more continued Labour by the multi tude of Mountains we were to Matter, and on that account it was highly neceflary to Feed our Caphalas well before we undertake fo great a Work. Chawtalhy • ( by themoft valuable Munificence of the Benefactor, yet living to Overfee this good Deed compleated ) is a noble new Caravan, an Ample and Princely Building; Near to it was, not long fince, only a Well of Bitter Water, which gives Name to the Place; but by the Coft and Inqueft of this Pious Benefactor, Sweeter Waters are at this time produced, fomething more remote, for Men to Drink, though the Cattel refufe not generally the other. On thefe Mountains the Mafiich Tree brings forth plenty of that Gum, of which the Country People make good Profit: Nor does lefs benefit accrue by the Mellifluous Dew a-Nights turned into Manna, from the Leafs and Shrubs, as well as Plants, upon the fides of thefe Mountains, which are not altogether fo Barren.as thofe we have hitherto palled; this Manna is White and Granulated, and, what I have found my felf, I think not inferior to the Calalr 'tan, li As Moufar the lit- moft extent of the Province of Lhor-t Charetalk. *■ S; Manna'242 T raveh into P R.

A Mile from the Town had been a Colofs, now half ruined by Age, bearing ftill fome Marks of its priftine Majefty, it being more than Sixty Foot high, and Thirty in Circumference, raifed in Me mory of fome departed Saint; it overlooks a great many more hum ble Tombs, not liable therefore to fuch Dilapidation.

What wanting is tofillthe place, Ndt from Band Maimer is, but the Cheefe. Band Vvas the Epithet to the Prophet, which fignifies Abftemicus, a Virtue mdre admired than followed, and Haimero his Proper Name, wherefore both the Bridge and Plain, as well as River, by Boterus is corruptly called Bindamire, as appears by this ridicmojisTravels into P E R S I, A. 251 Tale;, which I mention for this end, that the true Appellation the Ferfiam now give them, and their Reafon for it may be recovered. The Bridge over the River is very old, raifed high by four Arches, in the middle a Watch-Tower for the Rhadars to look out on, to ap prehend fuch as fhall by By-ways attempt to deprive them of their Cuftoms, as alfo to be at hand to fecure thofe that Travel the Road. Unlefs fometimes they connive at Excurfions for their own Booty, as this Day we had caufe to fufped:; for this Evening the Rear of our Gaphala we had taken with us, being only Servants with Arms C the other coming more leifurely, kept the diredRoad), were fet upon twice; but finding them in a condition to receive them, they wheeled off in the Dusk, but with an intention to take us napping when we were in our Lodgings at Meergofcoon, Twelve Mile off the Bridge, fmooth Way, full of Farms and Country Towns; among which Plain dealing feems moft an end to be their only Guard ; for they being alarmed by the Rogues that dogged us, rofe immediately in our defence, and gave us notice of our Danger, after one of the Villains, on pretence to light his Pipe, had rudely broke in upon us, to difcover in what Poflure we were, who perceiving their Pains would be only Blows, gave us no farther difturbance. However we were the more willing on this account to get up by the crowing of the Cock, to purfue our Journy to whofe Ruins we had reached by Break of Day; when having compafled its Marble Foundations ( being above, an Area of a large Extent, on the Plain an high Wall, giving fome Pains to the attollent Mufcles of the Neck, to give the Eyes leave to reach its Height), weclambred a fpacious Staircafe united fome part of the Way up, when on each hand it led to the feveral Apartments two different Ways; at top were the Portals, and the Heads of the Columns worn with Age {damnofa entrn quid non tmminmt dies ) which confumes every thing; whofe Bodies were Corinthian, but the Pedeftals and Capitals of Do- rick Order, as might be gained from what had refifted the corroding Jaws of Time, hardly lifting up their Reverend Crowns, though of moft durable Stone. Being entred the Fcmcerium of Cambyfes Hall ( if Faith be to be given to the moft Learned of thefe Relators ), at the Hall Gates we encountred two horrid Shapes both for Grandeur and Unwbntednels, being all in Armour, or Coat of Mail, ftriking a Terror on thofe about to intrude; their Countenances were of the fierceft Lions, and might pafs for fuch, had not huge Wings made them flying Gryf- fons, and their Bulk and Hinder-Parts exceeded the largeft Ele phants. In this Auguft Place only Eighteen Pillars of Forty remain, about Fifty Foot high, and half an Ell Diameter, of the diftance of eight Paces one from another, though we ^ould count the Twenty two Bafes *, which agree with the Perfian Memoirs, who therefore ftill call it Chulminor, The Palace of Forty Pillars: Thefe may be feen on the Plain a great way, and at prefent are the Refidence only of the Tyrants of the Lakes and Fens, Storks only keeping their Court here, every Pillar having a Neft of them.

Which may ferve to contradict the received Opinion, of Storks abiding only where Commonwealths are ; this always having been an Empire, and at this time is the mod Abfolute in all the Earth. Beyond thefe, many Pieces and Scraps of Antiquity offer us a View, and great CoUJfus's fupporting vaft Giants, as if they had been Yeomen of the Guard in the Anti-room to the Prefence-Cham- ber, which was Eighty Foot Square, where on the Fragments of Walls {landing, and over the Porticoes efpecially, were moftcuri- oufly cut out of delicate White Shining Marble, Men in Military Habit, like the Old Grecian Phalanx (if there be leave for Con- jedhire) encompafling a Monarch reprefented fitting on his Throne, with a Moving Canopy, fuch as the Eaflern Kings have carried over them : On other parts Bucephalus, or if that pleafe not, fome Per- fian Steed priding himfelf to carry an Emperor, or fome Demi-god. Becaufe neither Quintus Curtius , nor after him Plutarch y mention the reedifying this Palace either by Alexander or any of his Cap tains , yet I cannot let it pafs without this Remark, That they are habited more like the Ancient Grecians, than Ferfians now are; be- fides, the Hair of their Heads is hanging down, and not tied up, which is different from the Modern Fafhion of this Country. In this Apartment Eight Doors feem to anfwer each other, Two on each fide of every Square; which Conformity is attended with extraordinary Elegance and Workmanfhip; the Roof feems never to have had any intervening Pillars, and whether the Beams were of Cedar, it is not fo fortunate as to have a Voucher of its own Nation. Many other Parts declared Coft and Pains enough, but nothing more worthy Study than the Characters fairly imprefled and engra ven, which would unfold the Truth of the Founders of this Build ing, t were they as Intelligible as Legible; for they remain like the Hand-writing on the Wall {Mene Tekel}, till fome Divine Expo- fitor interpret them; yet I muft needs fay, many of the Charaders may be found in the Greek Alphabet. I his vafl Fabrick is made bigger, by being joined to a great Mountain, out of whofe Entrails were worn, rather than digged, Noble Caverns with Stately Sculptures, and wide Ponds of living Water conftantly diftilling from the Marble Rocks, either for bath ing or neceflary ufes: It is an admirable Piece, overlooking all the Piain, where we took this day's Repaft, and over Head faw the Corniih of the Frontifpiece embellifhed with the Royal Arms of the Verfun Emperor, immediately on the Union of the Medes and ?tr- pans into one Empire, whicliwas a Ram's Head delineated as far as the Cheft.

The following Day drove us, out of the fame Curiofity, over fe- veral Branches of Bindam'tre River, to enquire for other Strud:ures of the like Nature, of which thefe Mountains afford plenty, bating the great Area of Terfepolis, which diftinguiflies it from thefe ; but we did not alight for thefe, fatisfying our felves to flare on them from beneath, they being fit only for Atlafes, or for Winged Folk to look into, there being no paffageto them, appearing like Dens or open Holes on the fides of the Rocks, from their very Mouths per pendicular to the Ground: Only one above the reft attracted our Sight and Animadverfion, reported and ilill averred to be of old the Court of Ruftam, an Ancient King of the Gaurs or Gahers ( the true OriginalRace), whofe Statue Was of a Gigantine Sta ture, on asl^rge a fized Horfe, triumphing over his Foes at the Front of his Cave, with many Attendants clad down to the Heels, with Caps on their Heads ( not Turbats) and their Hair loofe about their Shoulders. From whence obferving frequent Numbers of thefe, T was apt to colled 1 , that even what goes now for the Terfepolis whkh Alexander gave leave in a Drunken Fit to be fet on Fire at the Requeft of the Coftly Thais, may be the Ruins of fome Heathen Temple, having feen of the fame Recedes among the Idolatrous Indians, which they ftill pay Adoration to, and own to be the Temples of their Gods. But that that City might (land in this Plain, not only the recei ved Tradition among all European Travellers, but the concurrent Opinion of undoubted Hiftorians, certify with all the probable Con jectures. From hence under thefe high Hills we kept our Courfe, proving it to be a Wealthy Plain, ftored with all Cattel, Corn, and Wild Fowl, by the plentiful Afflux of Water to the River from the Mountains, and Cuts from the River into the Plain, whereby it might be a fit Situation for the mighty ferfepolisy as it now is for ftore of Country Towns, befides whole Armies of Nomades, or wandring Shepherds, who pitch their Tents with all their Families, wherever they find a Soil fuitable to their Employment. Not far from whom were mulr titudes of fuch Tombs as we met with at Bonaru Level, which perhaps may give fome furer Account than that more Romantick one in ap pearance we met with there, of their being the dying Trophies of former Battels; though here wants not matter to countenance fuch Tales to thofe of eafy Faith.

That thefe Burial- Places took their beginning fo long ago, as it would favour of fmall Judgment in the Affirmative, yet it may leave ibme ground to the credulous, that it is poffible fome as notable Fights might fucceed, for the gaining fuch a Key to fo Rich and Spacious a Valley, as well from time to time after Alexander, as that not a Century fmce, this Part remained almoft unfubdued, till Shaw Ahas the Great brought ittoperfed: Obedience, when there might be occafion for fuch In terments, if their Piety extended to fuch a Care of the Dead. But thefe Field-Inhabitants incline me to think it their Work, being far from any Town; though the common Fame give it to the other Report, as well to aggrandize their foregoing Anceftry, as to caft a Luftre on the prefent Pofterity. This may ferve alfo to prove their Scythian Antiquity ; for as the Worthy Mr. Sheringham obferves, Sac a opiliones Afiam incolentes ; that the Sacce were wandring Shep herds ; whofe Names, to (hew their Original, he derives from the Hebrew f-DD, i. e. Tahernaculum^ or Tent in EngliP) ; from whence came theG^, as well as prefent ?erfians x from their frequent dif- burthening themfelves by Colonies difperfed both into Scythla, fo to Europe as well as Afia, where they firft inhabited. From Meergoftoon to this Strait is # meafured Twenty Mile, which finilhes not this Stage, for now we were encompafled .again with Rocks and Stones among the Mountains, (which we know whofe In- {ligation it was to command they Ihould be made Bread ), ourProvi- (ions being fpent which we had taken for this Deviation; wherefore we wgre forced to march Twenty Miles farther, to Maijm, before either we or our Cattel baited ; where we arriv'd before our Capha- la we had left at Siras, they pretending they had loft their Way, but more truly lingred, not having us to fpur them on; wherefore we were obliged this Night to make the Earth our Lodging, our Arms our Bolflers, and the uneven Stones our Feather-beds ,* which though we Travellers often do in this Journey out of choife, yet we found it difagreeable, becaufe the Nights now were as intenfely Cold, as the Days were Hot. In the Forenoon to the next Day the Caphak came, which created us this Day's Stay at Ma'tjm, * Town where grows the beft Walnuts, of the fame bignels with theSpamJh, and the choiceft Tobacco Perfia affords. After a.fweet Nights Repofe, early in the Morn between the Straits of the Mountains, we traced the Source of the River Araxes, purling under flippery Pebbles, which no fooner removed, than the Cryftal Water bubbles forth, by which means, though a little fup- preiled at firft, in Half a Mile s {pace it emits a Stream able to drive i hree Mills, which notwithftanding were not forcible enough to reftrain the impetuous Blafts of Heat pent in between the Hills: Although Maijm.'fflhencejli!,!

The Sweet Almond grows on a taller Tree, whofe Leafs are like Afh, and ripen about the fame time. The Piflacia fends forth its Branches on high, and renders its Nuts edible \n Autumn, whofe Leafs are as big as a Walnut's, covered un derneath with a foft Grey Down; all thefe are covered with a fuccu* lent Green Shell like a Walnut without, which includes an harder within, in the Shape and Subftance we have them brought: Though I find them differently defcribed both by Gerard and Lolelius, The Ca/&gt;/&gt;^-Shrub accompanies us in the Valleys from C^//er hi ther, and is encompafs'd with Prickles fomething emulating our Goosberries ; the Leaf is (baped like Purflain; the Seeds or Fruit, which we call Cappers, have a Cod not different from the Cod of the Major Cardamom, in which they are inclofed : In May the Flower is white and open, like a Sweet-Briar's. The lofty Pine, the Top of the Woods, as well as of thofe float ing on the Main, is not fo Tall in Afta as in Europe, though ftrdt up to the very Top, and is not bunched till the Boughs aloft thrufl out the Leafs to embrace the Woody Subftance of its Cone-like Ap ple ; the Body is (baled like the Palm-Tree.

As we drew nigher Spahauft, the Dovecots were more thick and Dovecots for more (lately, they being covered ove? with a white Plaifter, and SaIt ' Pwre - neater than thofe we firft faw : Of fuch concern is it to the King to preferve thefe.

In the Afternoon therefore, w^e went to Mirge, Eight Miles more, Mirge,- to an old lonely Inn, where was the laft place we rufticated. The Morning following being met by the Citizens of Spahaun beyond ihtVrchin Hills, Three Miles from Mirgf, who Congratulating our Arrival, fpread in the Highway a noble Table on Carpets furniflied with the Delicacies of this Country, which is enough to commend it both for Cold Treat, Fruit, and Wine.

Which River was Fifty Ells wide, but not Navigable; this Summers drought having made it Fordable in many places, efpecially now the Emperor fills this place with his Court and confluence of Mili tary Men ; the great Commanders and Minifters of State diverting the Channel to their own private Commodity, and for want of this Years Rains, it is hardly fufficient, (they Watering their Gardens therewith) by reafon of which unkindly Nurture, both the Beauty and Goodnefsof the Fruit and Trees do Flag this Autumn. Here at the Foot of the Bridge waited to bid us Welcome the felfeline Chriftians, with the feveral Europe Refidents, as Dutch, French* Portugal, and Ruffian, with their refpedive Trains, Trum' peters with their Enfigns, and Led Horfes richly Trapped, with Shotters and Pages, befides thofe of our own, appearing in their greateft Glory; thus Attended we were brought over a moft Mag nificent Bridge with Arches over our Heads, and on both fides Rails and Galleries to view the River, the Cloyfters whereof were Paved with broad Marble, in which were feveral Niches and open Portals; the uppefc* part was all Brick, the Foundations Black Marble with gradations to the bottom.

Yet to let you know I am notfofoppifh an Admirer of Foreign Splendour, as to forget to give the due Reverence to my own Nation ,* they, as they exceed anything of that kind with us, the extremity of Heat and Cold which this Country is fubjed: to, obliging them to this Contrivance, for their Cuftomers fake as well as their own, to defend them from the Injury of the Weather; fo it would be vain to our Countrymen to attempt it, who enjoy better Houfes than thefe dare feem to Ered; and have a Warehoufe in every Shop, when thefe, at beft, have no more tofhew than their Stalls, however fpecious Fabricks they are fhrowded under ,• admitting Lights by Lanthorns a-top, or open Holes, not on the fides, the better to Illuftrate their Goods, and caft Falfe Lights on them. Through thefe we were direded to the Midan, or Hypodrme, an Oblong Square Court, where the Horfes are Exercifed before the King's Palace, and where are upper and lower Walks, with open Archfs tor Spedators; not Inferior, though of different Shape, to the old Amphitheatres.

Having undergone the Pompous Fatigues of Saluting, and being thereby taught the Formalities of Compliments, more than truly acquainted with the Current of Affairs here ; I found it true, That an exalted Pitch of State is more tirefome than a meaner Condition, it being only a more confpicuous Confinement j for not to move abroad without a Retinue, is to have a Supervifor to every Motion, and a Man is lefs free either to obferve or act: Wherefore being tutored before-hand what, a Difrepute it was to the Nation whofe Title we bore, to appear to its Difgrace, I refolved to avoid that In decency, and change my European Cloaths for a Perfian Veft and Turbat, that I might walk about undifcovered , without any Re- fled ion to the Publick Minifterof my Country, and give my Eyes that Satisfaction my Ears were not capable of receiving ; by which Expedient my View was lefs tranfient, and I had time to dwell lon ger on any Objedt. The firft whereof that attraded my Stay, was to examine the Druggifls, whom I found to be all Jews, who are very numerous, and live apart, though their Shops are in common with the Natives in the Buzzars, mixed among a Crowd of other Tradefmen; who fell by Retail, and pafs without any Brand, having their Synagogues open every Sabbath day. Thefe are the greateft Brokers, and as cunning, it not exceeding the Banyans, who alfo are in every Cor ner, lurking to make a Prize. The Fruiterers placefhemfelves at the Entry, and in the wide open Fruiterers. Places under the Chief Cupuloes of Buzzars, vending, befides Fruit, Sherbets of Pomgranats, Prunellaes, Limes and Oranges, with Ice and Snow to cool them. Ice diflblved in their Liquors, is as prevalent here as at Sir as, fo that the Poor, have they but a Penny in the World, the one half will go for Bread, and dried Grapes, or Butter-milk, and the other for Snow and Tobacco. Befides thefe common Buzzars, there are others fet apart f9r choice Silk Buzzars, Commodities, as Silks and Velvets, Sarhaff, that is, Gold and Silver Cloth, Embroidery, Perfian Carpets, both Woollen and Silk, inter mixed with Gold and Silver very coftly, which are the peculiar Ma nufacture of the Country: In thefe we meet with Merchants of all Nations and Languages, brought hither for the fake of TraiBck, who furnifli this City with all Foreign Wares, and in exchange car ry the Product of this Land into the utmoft Parts of the World. On which account it is, the Armenians being skill'dinall the In- tUe Armm* tricacies and Subtilties of Trade at home, and travelling with thefe ans fubtle into the remoteft Kingdoms, become by their own Induftry, and by DeaIets • being Fadors of their own Kindreds Honefty, the Wealthieft Men, being expert at Bargains wherever they come, evading thereby Brokeridge; and fludying all the Arts of Thrift, will Travel for Fifty Shillings, where we cannot for Fifty Thomands; fetting out with a ftock of Hard Eggs and a Metarrah of Wine, which will laft them from Spahaun to the Port; riding on a mean Beaft, which they fell or fhipofF for Advance, their only Expence being Horfe-meat ; travelling with no Attendance, their Matrafs ferving at once for ' Horfe-264 Travels into PERSIA.

And from thefe expatiating the Terreftrial Globe, together with the mix'd Concourfe of other Merchants from all Parts it is, that the Commodities of all the Earth are feen in diftindt Buzzars in this one City, as cheap as in their feparate Homes. For beholding the Sack cloth Buzzar, for fo they call Engtifb Cloth, I thought it exceeded B/arfwe/l HaW , or any Cloth-Fair in England, being piled in huge Quantities both in their Shops around the Buzzar, and Heaps amidd thereof, of all Sorts, Colours, and Conditions; where I bought a Coat of Broad-Cloth to line with Furrs againfl: the Winter, for Fourteen Shillings ihzCohit, almoft equal with our Yard, for what lamfurel have paid Twenty Shillings the Yard at home. Whereby it was eafy to guefs, that the Company's Broad -Cloth came to a Bad Market, the Merchants bringing it in Truck for their Goods cheaper from the Mediterranean, than the Company could fend it, of which at prefent there is a great Glut: Nor will their Tin fare much better, for that Tuthinage brought from the South- Seas anfwers in all refpedfo, if not furpafles the fined of that Metal. From hence T went to the Caravan Ser Raws, flateJy huge Fabricks of Brick and Stone, bigger than our Inns^of Court, but far more uniform, being Three or Four Stories high, with Walks and Galleries; every Country has a feparateone, where they lodge whole Capbalaes for Sale of Indian (Z\oi\\, furkifo, Arahian, European, and all manner of Goods from the Four Quarters of the Univerle. Here they Rent the Warehoufesand Apartments, not Let them out at free-coft, as up on the Roads: The King and Queen, as they have built Royal Ones, receive from them a great Annuity: Some of thefe Caravan Ser Rm with th^ir Goods and Chapmen, refemble moftour LeadenhallUu- ket and Market-houfe ( not for the Shambles there, which is be yond any other, but) for Hides and Leather from Bulgaria, turky, and of their own drefling, which excels that we call Spanijh, or the bed Cordevan for Finenefs, and Shagreen for Durablenefs; for Bri dles, Harnelles, Boots, and Shooes, here are beyond compare. The next great Buildings are the Balneos, to which they go with as much Devotion as to their Temples, not permitting any Hetero dox to their Opinion, to Bathe with tl\em. Their Coffee-houfes, as they are more publick, are finfe Rooms, mining with Lamps in all their Buzzars. Nor can we forget another fort of Black Traders, burning Light at Noon day, which are the Necromancers, whofe Shops are beftuck with Candles lighted in every Hole, who pretend to unravel the Secrets ot Nature, to difcover Things loft, help the fooli/hly-inqui- jitive to the Sight of their Abfent Lovers, and by their Art can command Fate, and prophefy all things to wheedle their Admirers; which is fo general, that they have Profelytes of all Qualities and Degrees. * In N^'UdofPn. vSi uhci; '»:r i&lt;5 L m^ M'tionsi »b t |C 'i with ontYrit ne \ ard at lio^ : | le Company's y r,n g ln g it in Trod tr great Glut: l e bought froniti' fethe iineliofik Rm, (lately t|[; ins^of Court, luri: i, with Walks ai they lodge raltk », Eurofean, audi Univerfe.

Of the Armenian Chriftians here are more than Six thoufand ^000 Families Families, befides an innumerable Company of difperfed Husband- ilj^ enians men in the Villages, following their Patriarch in the fame Faithi The French are all Calvinifis. The Gahers, or Gaures, are the true Perfian Race, the undoubted T he n ?f^^ ,, Heirs both of their Gentilijm and Succeffion, attributing Divine 1 e ' Honour to the Fire, maintaining it always alive in their Deltihriums, or Places fet apart for their Worlhip; and if by GhanCe they fhould let it go out, they muft take a Pilgrimage to Carmania, where their moft Sacred Fire was never extinguiftied, as if it were a Piacular Wickednefs to attempt the renewing of it elfewhere, that being preferved by a more than Veftal Care, from the firft time the Sun, their Chief Deity, was pleafed to enlighten it with Sparks from its own Rays. The Men and Women are clad with long Veils and Breeches to their Heels, the Hair of the Men appearing under their Caps or Bonnets; the Women have a long Mantle, and are bound about the Head with an Hair-lace, like the Defcription Curtius gives of thofe conquered after the Ruin of Ferfepelis, who bound their Heads with the Slings they ufed to flay the Venifon they fed on, ftraggling on the Mountains, and kept in Dens and Caverns of the Earth, which made it a matter of great difficulty to overcome them.

This Solemnity has been fo Splendid, that the Emperors and the Court were wont to honour it with their Prefence, when they were entertained with Interludes, and Reprefentations of the Birth the Morning being ufhered in. with Vocal and Inftrumental Mufick with Millions of Flambeaus, and fhewing the Angels and Shepherds' with the Heavenly Hoft, Singing frames toGodonhkh, and aoodmil towards Men, When this was performed, the Rich Merchants ftrove to exprefs their Senfeof thefe Favours, by inviting them to extraordinary Ban queting and Feafting; and after ExpenfiVe Repafts, the River being confecrated for the purpofe, the Ceremonies of Baptifm were per formed, when notwithftanding it is extreamly cold, thofe of Riper Years were baptized, and fwam about for the Diverfion of the Court • concluding all with a Night of Jollity.

The great 0ver tIie PortaI are curioufly painted Men and Women in European Garden at the Drefles: From the Entrance up to the Mountains, Marble Steps make cww e th . e A{cent whic : h Nature had framed difficult enough other- wife ; up which the Limpid Streams are forced to fend their Currents through Five feveral Channels laid with Marble, two at the feet of the Sycamores, which railed in two Foot-pads, and ran immediately to the River; the other three emptied themfelves into the Tanks, to which two Stone Cauleways gave an Even Walk to Foot-men, by the middle Channel parting them, and at every Tank afcended or delcended by Marble Grades, while the Horfe-way was floped for their Paflage, entringon one fide, and coming back the other; and eve.^ 7 Two hundred Paces, Bathing-places of a large Circumfe rence receive great plenty of Water from the three Channels in the middle, into which the Marble Steps go down to the Bottom, which is paved with a cleanly Floor of the fame Polifhed Stones; and this is begun from the beginning of the Chaur&amp;augy whence it defcendi to the River, and thence rifes the fame height to the End of the Gar den: In the Garden its felf, variety of Green Trees flourifhing, yiweet Odors fmelling, clear Fountains and Rivers flowing, charm all the Senfes; nor is there lefs furprizal at the ravifhing Sight of the delicate Summer-houfes by each Pond's fide, built with all the Advantages for Recreation and Delight.

Lions, belonging to the Emperor : And from this place up to the Palace Gate, are feen every Evening all the Gentry of the Qty Riding to and fro with Hawks on their Fifts ; managing their Steeds, making of Matches for Shooting, Hunting, Courfing, or Hawk ing ; fliewing their Gallantry in Apparel and Retinue, as well as difpofition to Sport; being as much frequented as our Hide ?ark y and for as little purpofe, only to fee and be feen, though the whole pretence be to take the Air. Near thefe Ponds, or Tanks, are Coffee-Houfes, which furnifli them when they difmount, with Coho, Tea, or Sherbets ; while they fit in State, and fmoak Tobacco with their Attendance about them. The adjacent Houfes, Orchards, and Gardens, may be truly faid to be in the Virge of the Court, many of them ferving only for the Emperor to fhifc with his Seraglio, while the other Apartments are Aired ; though the great Divan, or Council be always held in that place refpeding the Midm, or Tomcsrium, in the heart of the City; and the reft are but given during Pleafure, to the chief Officers at Court; Wherefore reckoning all thefe Dwellings as Appendices ( which indeed they are ) few Monarchs will appear to have a larger extent to hold their Court in, it being above a Third part of the whole City; which being granted, it will not be hard to imagine fo Great and Abfolute a Potentate fhould be Courted by all the Worlds and from all the parts' of the Earth the wonderful Works of the Creation (hould be brought as Honorary Prefents ; nor can it be fup^ pofed that fo wide and fpacious a Palace fhould not afford room for more than the ancient Ark, though not freight with Pairs of all the Species, yet more of feveraL Whence it is, that here is to be feen more readily, and withlefs hazard, the OfTfpringof mofl Soils, except Human, and the Creatures of every Nation, rather than the Women of this Court, which are at lefs liberty than the Beafls, being Cooped up in their Sties, more flridlly than thefe are kept in their Dens; many of the fierceft and untamedfl of thefe being allowed only to breath in the open Air as Nature Ordained them: But not to tire my felf, nor you with Parti culars, 1 (hall bnly mention what were ftrange to me. The firfl whereof was the Rhinoceros, who is a Cruel Beaft, of a large Size, there coming from his Nofe an Horn a Cubit long, (Brown towards the Bottom, Whiter near the Point) and Six Inches Diameter, whence the derivation of his Name from Pty, NafuSy a Nofe, and K«^, Cornu, an Horn; between this Ani mal and the Elephant, is a mortal ftrife, for which Nature feems to have armed it on purpofe; it being a Four-footed BeafJ, with Three Partings of the Hoof, built on thick flrong Thighs, but fhort, con- fidering the great bulk of its Body which prefles them; it is Tall enough to regch the Bowels of its Antagonift with its Horn, with which it Gores him to Death ; nor has fhe given him lefs firm Bones to the Trunk, if by chance it fhould be crulhed by the Elephant, des- fending its very Hide with a Coat of Mail; wherefore before on the Neck and Shoulders, and behind in the Quarters, the Skin lies ill Folds, like Fidi Scales, over one another; the Face bears much of art TheRhuwcdi ros, not th6 Indian Onager, It |iHHU 288 Travels- into PERSIA.

Whether the Rhinoceros be the Unicorn, I fufpend my belief fince I have feen an Horn turned with Furrows and Ridges from the Bafis to the Point, and Tapering like that of our King's Arms: But what Petrus Angelius relates cpncerning the Onager^ or Indian Afs can have no congruity with this, unlefs in refped of the Virtues' for though his Verfes are mod Elegant in his 5'.

That this Opinion is taken up upon the account of the Rhino- ceros his Horn, I can certainly verify, and that great Prices are of fered for thofe that are inadulterate ; which they in India pretend to try by the Liquors prefently fermenting in them &gt; but notwithftand- ing that Experiment they are often deceived by falfe Horns made into drinking Cups; thus much is true of the Rhinoceros, but the other part ot it holds not Water; they come from Bengala, and are efteemed terrible and indomitable Creatures: And thefe muft be ^or none) what this Author calls Afles, there being no other Beads in thefe Parts with but one Horn; and I am afraid he ismifla- ken as to the African Afs alfo, fome Writers having called Africa India y u hich might have been urged in his excufe, whofe Skin I having formerly admired when in India, you will eafily be convinced it is no fuch Creature, it having never an Horn ; Two Live ones were fent hither from the Ahajfin Emperor, as an Expreffion of Re- fped: to this Court; which, with other valuable Rarities brought by his Ambafladors, were lately gracioufly received.

What Family to mix this Kind with, I am at a lofs, unlefs they be a-kin to the Onager, or Wild Afs, mentioned by Xenophon in the Expedition of the Lefler Cyrus; the fame we read in Pliny in his 8.

Now nothing can be Tamer than thefe before us, and therefore un likely to be the Wild ones of Xenophon in Arabia y but are moft allu red ly the Breed of Africa; however Petrus Angelius Bargaus comes pretty near the Mark in this, though not the other; however he is miftaken in the Place, as well as the Race of both: ;i 'Ml ■ i' - ' *&gt;■'■*■ ' ' .

' Night drawing on, we unwillingly left thefe Spedades, and fell into a lovely one between thefe Grbves; for now all the Pride of Spahaun was met in the Chaurhaigy and the Grandees were Airing themfelves, prancing^about with their numerous Trains, ftrivingto outvie each other in Pomp and Generofky ; but comefhort of thofe Incentives to Chivalry that fpur on our Gallants; the Graces Adorn our Parks and Malls Crowned with Virgin-Garlands, whofe loofe Garments wave with the flowing'Wind, and provoke the Amorous Spark to lift himfelf a Volunteer under thofe Banners; whofe Maiden Faces bear the frefh Colour of the blooming Rofes on the Lilly White of their natural Complexion, bein^ wonderfully taking both in their Shape and Meen ; Chearfuland Free in their Difcourfe, but with an awful Combiners; Faceitou$ afid Pleafant, 4)ut with an un- fpotted Innocence ; enough to miUe Cato lhake off his Severity and reconcile himfelf to Good Nature: Such t)aphnes as thefe (worthy the greatalas? this Curled Soil knows not the Blefting of, nor dare rifey truft them out of Doors; for their fiery Spirits (like Water on Sea-Coal) by the Society of fuch Nymphs, would reflcfer their Heat more intenfe by intemperate Jealoufies. After the Armenians had treated us, the French Artifans thought themfelves concerned to do the like; that they might not be thought to live here inJlavery, but in a Condition to Entertain, not only their Friends, but to equal the higheft FligjHts the Armemm could pretend to; and-for*the Honour of their King and Nation, we were called on St. his Day, which they Solemnized v^ith frefli Devices of Fireworks, Illuminations, Interludes, and Farces; befides the Extravagances of Banquetting and Carowfing, Drink ing the Soph'is Health, and their Mafter's, after all the Eumm Monarchs.

Here are no Parks, Forefts, or Chaces for Sport, nor Meres* or Decoys for Game, nor indeed Medows yielding Hay for their Cat- tel, their Fodder being chopped Straw, and Barley their Provender all over the Empife; nor are here any Woods more than inclofed in Gardens, which is unfit for Building or Firing; yet of the tail Ma ple or Sycamore they have flit Boards for their Chefts for Wine and Fruit; neither is there any Turf or Coal , fo that Firing is more worth than Food, being forced to fend Camels to fetch it many days Journy hence, as has been faid at cur firft coming hither. In our Return we obferved feveral Tombs of the Ancient Gakrs, after thv fame manner as the Purjics in India^ and at top of the Mountains fuch Monuments as are on the fides of the Plain of Per- fcpolis, and one mo.^e eminent, in Honour of their great Champion, Ruflam ; but who this Ruflam was, both their Annals and Tradition give an unfatisfadory Account.

At the Foot of it is a large Coppice of Willows, reaching a great way by the Water-fide; here the Jelf alines met us with their ufual Noife of loud Mufick, and led us diredbly up to a Mountain, where the Emperors have digged a Grotto overlooking all the City, at their Retirements hither Ihading them from the Sun's Violence : This is fabled to be alfo Throne, as we remarked before in Duccan ; others pretend it was projed:ed by Darius, but for what end, unlefs for a Profped: of this large place hid in a Wood, I cannot guefs. Hence in two days we compailed the two Cities of IfpaJoaun and We were two Jelfa, taking more Ground by far than London and Soutbwark with days encom- their Suburbs, but then the moft part is filled with Gardens; how- ^ nfi ^ ever I believe them not to be fo populous: Yet the Frenchmen here avouch, Tnat more Melons, Cucumbers, and other Horary Fruits are confumed in this Place in a Month, than in Italy, France^ and Spain, in half a Year, eftimating by Balance of Six thoufand Afs or Mules Loads of them expended every day: For though they have good Butchers Meat and Poultry, their chiefeft Diet is on Fruit; anft if fuch vafl Quantities be brought out of the Country daily, befides what may be planted within their own Walls, it may be concluded fome Thoufands of Inhabitants contribute to the devouring of them; though it muft not be credited what is fpoken hyperbolically by thefe Citizens, That it is the biggeft City in the World, and therefore by way of Excellency called, The World. It is not fenced by Walls, nor has it more than one ftrong Tower with Mud Walls, fitter for Butts for Bows and Arrows, than to re- pulfe a Cannon-Bullet; only ferviceble at prefent to be the Exche quer of the Emperor, where are laid up great Treafures, the prefent Sophi being an intolerable Hoarder, beneath the Majefty of fo migh ty a Prince, repining even at mean Expences. But leaving him to his Covetous Humour , it remains only to changes of take notice of the Seafon at the end of this Month, inafmuch as the Weather, Bodies undergo herein the Autumnal Changes, which afflids them with Pleurifies, Catarrhs, Hoarfenefs, Conlumptions, Coughs, Ma« lignant, Putrid, Intermitting, as alfo continued Fevers, under this Fifth Climate: To which the Aphorifm of the Medical Divine has regard, when it fays, $ ooc&amp;y j Difpicere oportet regionem,tempus, &amp;c.

The 16 th of November put an end to their Faft, and began a Day of Jubilee; when the Leafs were all dropped off, and the Earth and Trees were naked; after which. Bodies indifpofed fue for a Writ of Eafe, and as the Winter is more piercing, they recover Health. December locks up all in Ice and Snow, and conftipates the Pores Sharp Winter of the Earth that it cannot be tilled ; the Tops of Mountains are here ' all capped, and the Sharp Winds and Serene Air make it lefs tolera ble than in Great Britain, it being ready to cut you through \ though then in the Sun it is fo warm, that the Poor are beholden to it tor their Stores: It feldom fnows above three or four days together, but . that is fufficient to load the Mountains, and to fill the Valleys for many days, before it be diflblved. And then it proves fatal to the Houfes built only of Mud 5 for whilft they feek to fecure the Roof, many times by fweeping it thence, the Snow melts at the bottom ,' and undermines their Foundations, that oftentimes they become mixt with the Dirt in the Streets.

And lad of all, for a final and undeniable Experiment of the Purenefs and Clearnefs of the Air here, let a Sword, never fo well Polifhed, (and they have the bed Damafcened Swords) lie un- fheathed a whole Night, or longer, in Snow, or Water; take it thence and never wipe it, and it lhall not Ruft: Befides, now at Chrijimas time the Grapes fold for Food in the Market are fo dry they may be powdered; Carry thefe individual Grapes down to Port and you fhall in Four or Five days ( fhort of the Bunder) fenfibly perceive them to imbibe the thicker Air, and contrad: a Clammi- nefs; which proceeds from the remotenefs of Spahaun from any Sea, Navigable River, Lake, or Fenn ; the Sea being the neareft, which is Five hundred Miles off; befides its being environed with dry barren Mountains, whence come fine, rare, and thin Blafts; infomuch that could Bodies ever be in an Equilibrium as to their Temperament, certainly it might be preferved here rather than in any other place; for whatfoever Stranger comes hither with an Healthy Conftitution, it is very lading; and the Natives who live Temperately* witnefs a good old Age, with a continued date of Health; the Endemial Difeafes of this Country being rather Acute than Chronical. We muft clofe up this Year with the fad News of the Death of our Prefident at Surat; He was a Mecosnas of Honed Studies; a great Cherilher of Ingenuity 5 of a Generous and Free Accefs; Mafculinely Candid; a Mader of all Languages and Sciences, as well as Skilled in Military Virtues; as if Mars had undertaken the Protedion of the Mufes; But fo envious are the Fates, that the beft things are fnatch'd away fird.

Wereturn'd thefame way, Travelling only in the Day time till Valleys filled we came to Ejfduchos, where becaufe the Snow had lliut up the WIth Snovf ' Valleys, we were forced to leave it on the right, and go about by the high Road, not frequented in Summer time fo much by light Horfemen, as now, there being no Paflage the other way ; w herefore our Entertainment this Journy is lefs Hofpitable, and the Caravan generally more rude, it being the ufual Trad: for Camels and their Drivers ( they moft an end providing only for themfelves) and better Guefts being feldom or never expected; fo that in all probability we might expedt to encounter Hardlhips; but the Silver Bait procu red all things that Man could furniflius with ; and we met with no other Difficulties than what the Weather created us.

From hence to Ohedah are Six Pharfangs ; it is a large Village abounding with Vineyards, which reach as far as Zermaw , Four Pharfangs farther; hitherto we Travelled Carpet-way , all the Ground being covered with Snow, andmoftanend theSunobfcured, and fometimes the Clouds falling in fleecy Whi^l Rain, as the poor Indians exprefs it, who w'ere alitioft ftarved to Death by the excef- five Cold, andftormy Blafts from the Mountains. klConacaraw, l ight Pharfa gs more, it began to clear up C though we feemed to carry the Winder with us, there having been little afore our Arrival and at Dehtd, Six Pharfangs more, we }eft the Plains on the Hills all along Planted with Vines, to afcend the pilednow covered with Snow, horribly bles r, and pe- riloufly cold with frofly.

AlConacurgu we found a Bridge necedary to pafs upon the diflbl- ving of the Snow from the Ridges of the Hills, and tracing the Mountains, we came in Eight Pharfangs to Mufhat; notable for the Sepulchre of one of their T\ Ive'Apoftles to their falfe Prophet| here we were glad to take up in a Farmers Houfe, in an Apartment whereof having caufed a Fire to be kindled, where I was to lie, my Servant, after I was in Bed and afleep, hulking about the Fire, fell with his Felt Coat, being Drowfy, upon the Embers ; which Burn ing made fuch a fmother, that I was almoft ftifled in the clofe Room before I could find the Way out; yet he lay Snoaring and unconcerned, when I could not get rid of the ftench in my Throat fome Days after. • i he Day following, we by Two Bridges crofled Two Rivers more, or it may be the fame that run to Bindamirc j and in a rainy wet Day took up our Lodgings at Zevan, but Five Pharfangs, and the next Day faw Perfepolls again ; entring the Plain by Two Pillars, upon whofe Cornifh was delineated double-headed Horfes as far is the Cheft j leaving thofe Ruins Quint us Curtius Co much Celebrated, defpoiled Covacurgu and Mujhat. /^ftanendthefev White Rain, j: lrv ed to Death by | Mountains. no re, it began us, there ki 'K SixFk/^!: 'laiHfid with Vine,!!:' ow, horribly i Thicker Air, tk- 'Skins whole;fci is Ikved witb )fedtothefcorcl !i: iPoniitum Mic': ) we had been in lis hulking aboattM- ;n the Emben; :i - s alfflod • ■ t; yet ^ i of' the § IjjSCBWf f pLifUnB? hilt fiVS ; ' ' ]&gt; rj Travels into PERSIA. 2 99 defpoiled of their Riches, we went through Meergofcoon, at the back- Chap.VIIL fide whereof the Plain was covered all along with Wild-Fowl, which Were fo Tame they would almoft permit us to knock them, on the head with our Sticks, not offering to ftir till we came on them, they „ being not ufed to bedifturbed. At Night we reached Zergoon, through flippery and flabby Way, and the Day after we brought with us the firft Snow to Siras. Here we reded Five Days, having loft Two Mules and One Pack- The Cold horfe out of Seven and twenty, and One Houfliold-Servant out of Sak^our /«- Ten that attended us; another we left behind at Moxutelegjgy, who dian SavantT was our Cook; and liad it not been for the French Chirurgeon, we ufeIefs . had been put toourfhifts, heboth ihooting and drefling moftof our Viduals after the moft exquifite French Way of Cookery: Nor muft any of us at this time take State upon him ; for our Servants, not ufed to fuch Weather, became rather an Impediment than Help to us; liftlefs, and loth to ftir, but always crowding in among us, cringing, and never at eafe but when about the Fire; not to be rowz'd on any occafion; rather looking for Seryice from us; by whofe Slothfulnefs we became as lowfy as Beggars, their huge Shags har bouring fuch Vermin, and they by no means being to be drove out out of our Company, but laid themfelves a-nights on the fame Floor with us. In this Ihort fpace the Sun began to recover Strength, diflblving the Snow as faft as it fell. Having fliifted our Lowzy Companions, they began to brisk up by degrees, as they felt the Warmth to increafe upon them : Here our Interpreter, a Soldier, zndz Carmelite Friar, joined us ; ( the French Chirurgeon being bound for Bunder Reek , left us ) : And the 19 th of January, fhaking off the hofpitable Impertinencies of fuch as followed us out of the City, we gained that Night Bohha- Hodge ; and the next Day travelled Falling, for the Execrable Death of the Martyr Charles the Firft; which (omething difcountenanced the Carmelite, feeing a Table fpread, as Cuftomary, at Noon, and not an Englifhman to eat a Bit, or drink a Drop; but being informed of the Reafon, he was more amazed, faying. He wonder'd at our StruStnefs, fince on their Fafting-days they were allowed a Buccado of Sweetmeats and a Glafs of Wine before Noon, and at Noon a fmall Repaft, and fo like wife in the Afternoon, but at Night a good plentiful Supper: With the latter part we promifed we would agree with him, but for the other we thought there was no great Reftraint put upon Nature. On the laft Day of the Month we found Caifar, a pleafant Village, bearing the firft Fruitful Palm this Way, where the Myrtle and the Orange-Tree is always Green, yielding Flowers in Bloflbms, Ripe and Green Fruit all at one and the fame time: Here fprings up the Bell-Flower, Violet, and Primrofe; fo that we may now fing with Horace; Solvit ur acris hyems grata vice veris &amp; Favoni, Ac neque jam flahulis gaudet pecus aut arator /£»/, &amp;c.

But the Checquer-work of this World prepared other Bufinefs for the fucceeding Day, bringing us over high Rocks, made plain by Coft and Pains: Here on the Tops of Mountains we only faw the Snow; however, the Winds blowing off thence, made us feel our quaking Joints ftruck through with horrid Numbnefs; by which means nothing more frequently happen'd, than one quarter of an hour to be feized with ihivering Blafts; and when they were over, the Sun by its powerful Heat another Quarter to fcorch our Skin, expofed to his Rays; by which fudden Alterations, not only our Hands and Faces were vexed, but our wholfi Bodies fuffered Lan- guilhment, as Ovid before us had tried in his Exile.

From whence the Air daily thicken'd in the Atmofphere, and the Sweat began to pour through our Pores, which in a more fubtle Air we could not perfpire, though Urine flowed there more plenti fully ; for a Thin Air gathers and contracts the Pores, forbidding the Efflux of Heat or Spirits, conftraining the Matter which otherwife would gently breathe forth, precipitating the Serum through the Urinary Conduits, and feparating it from the Blood, either by^Colla tion in the Reins, or by virtue of fome particular Ferment, accord ing to the Dodrine of the Learned VV'tUts. At Cormoot we met a Lion and a Spotted Deer carrying up as Pre- fents to the Sophi from the Mogul: The Lion ieemed rather a Cata- mountain, than fuch a Majeftick Creature as ours in Europe, being nigher a Dun Colour than* a Dark Red, without Beard, nor haired all from the Head down to the Creft and Thighs; about the Lips it had Briftles like a Cat, and when the Keeper ftroaked it, it would make a Noife much the fame as a Cat when Ihe purls: Thele are kept to fet upon Bulls before the Emperor, which they do fneaking- ly, coming behind them to leap upon their Quarters, which one of our right bred Englifh Maftiffs would fcorn to do; a true Bull dog being too hard a Match for one of thefe Lions, which has often been proved at the Court of Perfia , to the Commendation of their Courage.

But to let that pafs as not being much to the purpofe: All Waters, in general, participate of the Mixture and Nature of thofe Places through which they take their Current $ though all do not alike ftrike the Senfes, becaufe fome have a lefler Tindture than others; and Heterogeneous Particles confounded, or confufed, in a larger Vehicle, are not fo eafily perceived by the Tongue; which proves no more than this. That whatever Water has a fingular propriety from the common Water^ muft come under the denomination of Mineral Water. . i Which, with Varenius, we draw from a threefold Fountain, viz. Mineral Wa* from Corporeal, Spiritual, and a Mixture of either; thofe which guffhed'from run through Subterranean Meanders, in which the Metalline Earths Common, are not over denfe, they carry with them the Grains of thofe Mi nerals, and therewith beget the firfl Corporeal Waters. ff the Ores are lefs denfe, as Vitriol, Sulphur, and Salts, which diflolve of themfelves in Water, thefe create the fecond Clafs of Cor- poreals, or Mixed. And thofe in their paflage which are impregnated with the Fumes of thefe Minerals, are, as it were, rectified Spiritual Waters, and make the moll refined Order of them all. Out of thefe Three proceed Mineral Waters, which are either f Golden, Silver, Tin, Lead, or Iron, Waters; Waters of common Salt, Aluminous, Vitriolated, Bituminous, Sulphurious, or Anti- monial: Waters of feveral Earths, Stones, Lime, Chalk, and Ochre, Cinnabar, Marble, Alabafter, and laft of all, Mercurial Waters. The differences are to be referred to the individual Species of every TheJt differ- Water, as far as relates to their Eflence; but becaufe to inferior ence s. Capacities fuch do not fo readily occur, they are made more familiar by Sower, Bitter, and the like: The Explanation whereof, both as to their Caufes and Generation, is the Bufinefs in hand. Sea-Waters, Salt or Bitter (Bitternefs being only an exalted de gree of Saltnefs) come rather from the Pores through which they are drained, than from the grofler Particles remaining after the heat . of the Sun has Boiled off the Flegmy parts: Rain-Waters extra&lt;5ted by Rarefadion, are again Condenfed, and become Sweet in their falling: River-Waters vary according to their Colour and Tafte from the Qualities of thofe Conduits through which they take their Ccurfe, as do Spring-Waters, which have a double Origination,- R r either906 Travels into PERSIA.

Sower Waters have for their Progenitors Vitriol and Alum , ( not the Smoke of Sulphur) either of which are imbued with Acidity or Acerbity, whereas Sulphur enjoys neither; which is found true, however the Chymical Spirit of Sulphur drawn off, as alfo of Salt, become fo {harp. But to obviate that, If Sowernefe muft be beholden to the Sulphurious Vapours, how comes it to pafs that all Hot Baths have not that very Tafle ?

Befidcs thefe Baths, which are rare, there are more commonly Balneos to be hired at eafy Rates; of which I (hall fay no more than of the Benefits received by them ( not to note the Injundion of their Law ) ; when Bodies are parched by intolerable Heat, and the Duft galls and frets the Skin by Travel, then are they not only cleanfed, but highly refrefhed by bathing in fweet Water; fo that they are convenient both in Dry and Moifl Airs; for in Dry, without thefe they could no more breathe,than xhokArifiotle teftifies of,could with out Bags of Water on the Top of Olympus ; and in Moift, they are as necellary to wafh Dirt and Sand out of the Pores of their Bodies. As far the Medical Intent, many Diflempers caufed by Fulnefsof Humours, or ill-bred Chyme, are expelled by this Exorcifm ; but the Grand Expectation relating to Venereal Difeafes, is baffled and defeated by a groundlefs Fallacy.

The reafon to be ren- • dred for all this, may be, Becaufe the Strength of the Nerves con- fift in a Mediocrity of Heat; for what comes neareft: to Heat, agrees better with their Conftitution; but what brings Moifture is moft pre- judicial, according to the Mind of the great Author of Phyfick, Jpk 16. lih. 5'. Which notwithflanding, as every Nature is difpofed' fo it is affedred with this or that Difeafe: For the Fountain of all- Maladies, with their feveral kinds, (pring either from the Irregu larities of Air or of Diet, fince we are nouriihed by both, and can no longer live than while we breathe and fuck in Air, than we can fubfift without Food: Such therefore as the Air is, fuch are the Spi rits and Humours generated thereby; fuch as the Humours, fuch are the folid Parts of the Body, and in general the whole Microcofm. By Repletion therefore of the Brain, the Optick Nerves are debi litated and clouded by the Impurity of the Innate and Adventitious Air: The beginning of the Nerves being filled with Humidity, not only the forementioned Sicknefles, but Ulcerous and Foul Sores, by the aptnefs of the Air at this Jynfture combining with other con curring Accidents, make an open Way for their Procreation. Hence the Maritime Coafts, from the filthy Exhalations and nafty Vapours diffufing themfelves, imprefs a Dyfcrafy, or undue Mixture over the Mafs of Blood : to wit ; As if the Sulphurgus Saline Particles fhould be exalted, a Ranknefs of Temperament follows • by which means the Spirits are deprefs'd, and the Blood alterM into a fickly corroding Habit, for want of liberal Evacuation through the Emunftuaries, and fo are quite degenerated. As we fee, for inftance, now daily, the Clouds hovering about fhe bottom of the Mountains, fo the Hu mours profligated no other way, fettle in the extreme Parts, till they break out into ungovernable Ulcers, Scurvy, and the like. To avoid therefore the Stench of the Port, as well as Commu nication with the Cam, we often exchange Gombroon for Ajfeen, which now is perfumed with Jafmineof all forts, Rofes, Violets, andPrim- rofes, with other fragrant Flowers; here grow alfo the Black Hore- hound, Spurge, Catminth or Nepe, Liverwort, the lefler Centaury, Hedg Muftard, Wintercrefs, Grunfel, Field-Poppy, Broom, Goofe- foot, Arach, Cichory and Dill: The Barley growing here is now fit for the Scythe, being their firft Harvefl. In this Place as we rode to take the Air through Stony and Barren Places, we met a Channel of living Waters, brought from the Mountains ( whence it breaks forth ) by an Aquadud: , fometimes over little Bridges, fome- times piercing the very Mountains, at the Cofl: of the Dutch Banyan (the firft of this Tribe of Men that deferves Praife for his Contempt of Money, laviflied in many Places for the Publick Utility ), to the Duteh Garden, where it difembogues its felf into a great Stone Ci- ftern, for the ufe of the Farms on that fide of the Town.

Here are many Tombs of their Religious Men, who are wholly devoted to their Superftitions; and becaufe of the diverfity of in huming them, I (hall give you the manner as I received it; A round Pit, infafliion of a Well, being made, they place a ftone of Orms Salt for him to (land on, and another weighty one is put on his Head ; a Lamp being lighted, they lay Bread and a Jarr of Water by him, and give him a Staff in his Hand with fome Deneiros for his Journy; then they cover the Hole with Molds, and build a Turbi* nated Tomb, without any Hollow more than for a burning Lamp. Thus as this part bears the fruits of their Superftition, fo the Earth brings forth the Weeds of their Idolatrous Worfliip; the Arbor de Rah by the Portugals ; by the Banyans Kartgowii', for the Reverence paid by thenvto it, the Banyan-Trze : Befides this, this Soil yields good Mango's, Water Melons, and Sweet Onions, with that rank Poyfon Dutry, nigheft our Solanum Lethale.

Hence we came to Gerom, and by labouring in the Heat of the Day to get over the Mountains, we were perfecuted with Diary Fe vers : In this Munfel we found Avens Mother of Thime, Mullen^ Ro. man Wormwood with a Scarlet Flower, divers forts of Thiftles, efpe- cially the Holy Thiftle, a Remedy for the now raging Difeafes; as I am of Opinion, Nature has provided all Regions with Medicines peculiar for their Diftrefles. Coloquinta Apples grow like a fmall round Gourd on the Ground. Here in the Gardens were the firft true Beans and Peafe I faw fmce Wdt England. The old Caravan Ser Raw at Moccck Sugta is deferted by the Cara* van Dar t who has fhifted to a new one built by the fame Hand as that lately at Chawtalk, and abandoned the declining one to Serpents, Chameleons, and Tarantulaes ( which are not fo venomous as in the Straits), Centipedes, and Scorpions, it lying an open Receptacle for all Wild Beads. The North Winds about the middle of May raifed many a Whirl- Wind ; and before we came to Caifar, we found a fenfible Alteration from fcorching Heat to a fearching Cold; by which Change, our Garments that before hung loofe about us, are gathered together to wrap us clofe ; for all w hich, few efcaped without complaining of a fudden Pain in the Joints; and many were incident to putrid Fevers, who had indulged too largely on Raw Fruits. This fudden Mutation of the Air, brought not only on Mankind, but Beafts alfo, Catarrhs, and Defludions of all forts; to wit, from Hot and Moift (whereby we were bedew'd aH over with Sweat) into Hot and Dry in the Day, and at Night Cold and Dry, by rea- fon ot Impetuous Blafts from the North Eaft , by which the Pores being fhut, the inclofed Humours are put into a Fluor; there being not a Man among us, nor hardly an Horfe, but ran freely at the Nofe: Here, as the Air varied, we left off drinking Rain Water; which might have fome Influence upon us, it being preferred before all others, as having the Sun and Ocean for its Parents: The River- Water here is muddy, and is often carried under Ground by Pits, wherefore it pafles not, without leaving fome PutrefadHon behind j but the moft indigefted is Well-water, which is wholly deprived of the Sun.

From all which therefore to come home to what concerns us, who had undergone fome part of a Southern Winter ( if it may be fo called, at ), the Author of Salt Phlegm, the fubfequenc q Spring entring with the Winds, which are Dry, made us re tain that Phlegm; by which means we are followed by pertinacious and continued Fevers, as well as thofe that accompany Catarrhs, from the Intemperament of the Spirable Parts, whereby the Hu mour exprefled from the Brain, diftills upon the Lungs, by tranflati- on of Evacuation from the Habit of the Body, where it was wont to perfpire; but now thofe Channels being ftopt, it drops from the Head, to the difturbance of the whole Frame. This Comment relates only to us; for the Natives make light of fuch things as we call Colds, though they are aiieded with them this Seafon, but not to fo high a degree as we; for they eat and drink rather the more for them, and flight them at this time of the Year, but towards the Winter-Quarter they are more cautious. I muft confefsit was al ways my Opinion, Colds were not hurtful, fo long as they keep within the Bounds of a fimple Cold, but rather a means to rack off the Impurities from the Blood, as the Fermentation of Wines is of the like Advantage to them; but when inftead of clarifying it con founds the Humours, it is then to be taken care of, which daily Experience teaches it tranfgrefles often; as almoll all our Englijh being now down, can witnefs.

As con cerning their Original and Conception, there is fome difference among Authors, as betwixt Pliny and Anfelmus Boetius, and between them and Car dams : Pliny faith that they are conceived in Oyflers, by a certain Maritime Dew, which thefe Fifli (and fo likewife Scol lops ) do at a Set Time of the Year moft third after; and according as the Heavens are more Cloudy or Clear in the time of the taking in—— ' ■ I X. ldtlle Planks Mi,. ^ 20(1 the Mjio ;Jtl 1 of the Pirtiid JS to that Port, sfe to Mcckfa lel^ • 'wlrm, aodbti : ^nty Leagues oa: Tuit and all ijl ^ torefped thek, bringing fordr nmonFameafc moni infonmcltk }f any Value, w i Ketchrj, a &amp;: and Unequal, r them overlidnf v tkern Cods, fete .rchafe, I retord.

But this Opinion of Tliny concerning their Conception, is not, by Anfelmus thought confentaneous to Truth: For, faith he, I have ta ken out of thefe Shell-filh many Margarites, and they-are generated in the Body of the Creature, of the fame Humour of which the Shell is formed ; which Vifcous Humour is expelled fometimes ( not always) for the Fabrick of another Shell; for whenever this little Creature is ill, and hath not ftrength enough to belch up or expel this Humour which fticketh in the Body, it becometh the Rudi ments or beginning of the Pearls; to which, new Humour being ad ded and affimulated into the fame Nature, by concreting and con gealing begets a new Skin or Film for the former Rudiments; the continual Addition of which Humour generates an Vnzon, or Pearl; even as Stones are generated in the Gall or Bladder of a Man; and after the fame manner the Bezoar is generated in the Terjian Goat. Card anus, lih. 7.' de Lapidihus, faith, It is a Fabulous thing that the Pearl fhould be generated by the Dew of Heaven, feeing the Shell- fifhes in which they are conceived have their Refidence in the very bottom of the Deep. That which is reported of thejn, That they are foft in the Water, and grow hard, like .Coral, asfoonastheyare taken out, is not true, .faith Boetius, p. 84. For the firft, not only common Fame, but common Experience avouches; for the latter, I know not why it may not be as probable, as for an Egg newly laid, to have the Shell harden'd asfoon as dropped into the Air, when before in the Ovarium it participated of a Slippery, Tough, Glewy Sub- llance; not other wife to be fuppofed to come forth, than by endan gering the Fostus, ' ZJn 'tons are fo much the more efteemed, becaufe they cannot eafily its'Adultera* be adulterated. There are fi(^itious Jewels made of double Glafs, tion - which being fet in Gold, Jewellers cannot difcern from Pearl, except they take them out: Some will adulterate them with the Powder of the Shell of the Margarite, and others with Chalk covered with Leafs of Silver, and then anointed with the White of an Egg. Some adulterate them with the Powder of Pearl mix'd with the White of an Egg, and dried, and then poliftied; but thefe willeafily bedifco- vered from the True, by their Weight and Colour.

Which being confider'd, this Land is chiefly beholden to whole- fome Springs of Living Water, to quench the Third of Plants as well as living Creatures, which are to that End beftowed on them apart by a more Liberal Providence, than either of the former by a joint Confent. Notwithftanding the impending Clouds, they are moflly without . Rain; and though they lowre fome Weeks together, they rarely drop Moifture. The fudden Gufts and impetuous Blafts from the Mountains hin- dring them, oftner caufe near the Maritime Coafts, Hurricanes of Wind, and wonderful Tempefts of Sand, fo Thick and Black, that the Clouds raifed thereby benight the very Day, and while the Storm lafts (which is not long) induces a Darknefs to be felt; and the Fury over, it leaves the Effeds of a Fired Air: Unlefs when the Seven Stars arife on this Horizon at the beginning of Spring, when a mellifluous Dew lies not long on the Trees and the Plants, before it be concrete into the choiceft Manna. And although at Hated Times the Snow does furnifli them with Water, yet it fuffers in nothing more than in extreme Drought. Which is the reafon Eminent Cities and Market-Towns ftand not thick, but are at vaft diftances one from another; nor are the Villa ges lefs {haggling, twofcarcely falling under the Eye from the Tops of their higheft Mountains, excepting in fome few of their Wealthi- eft Plains.

The Palaces of the Potentates are built moftly after this manner : Towards the Street appears little or no Frontifpiece, more than the Porch, which makes a fquare (lately Building, arched at top, under which is a (lately Balcony, open on every fide, over the Haflle, which compaffes neat Apartments, and are defended from the Suns Heat by large Umbrelloes or Penthoufes, flretching themfelves wide to draw in the cool Air, the embowed parts whereof are fretted, and the out-parts fhine with Blue inlaid with Gold: The Cafements, or Folding-doors rather, fparkle with Glorious Panes of Glafs of feveral Colours, and declare the Workmanfhip of the Carvers; as does tha outfide Slates the Skill of the Tilers in Glazing and Painting, as well as the Marbfe Facing the Ingenious Defign of the Surveyor. From the Portal runs on each hand round the Garden a Mud-Wall very high, though not very thick, which another Wall thwarts juft in the middle, from the Porch to the main Building, thereby to part the Mens Quarters from the Womens; the latter whereof enclofes the Kitchen-Garden; the other is deftined for Fragrant Plants, Aro- matick Flowers, and outftretching Trees for Pleafure, as well as bearing Fruit for Ufe. The Houfes are fo contrived, that in the Summer they are open Banqueting-Houfes, refrelhed with Fountains as they fit in Frifco, which defcend thence to all the Quadrangles * by Water-Courfes. Since the greateft part of this Empire is not far off the Northern Tropick, it is therefore no wonder it fhould com plain of Heat, efpecially in the Summer, at which Seafon the Sun ftrikes the Earth more dired:ly with its Rays; for which caufe, amongft all of them, Aquadu&amp;s and Fountains in the very Rooms below Stairs, are mightily prized, with Water-works playing to cool the burning Particles of the incenfed Air; and the whole Structure is conftituted fo, that it may receive thefe Refrefhments every way it is capable: Wherefore they defend their Dwellings from the Sun, and are conftantly fprinkling Water around their Seats from thefe Currents ; and from their Tops have many Breathing-places to re ceive the Wind, which are fo fixed, that whatever Breezes (lir, they Ihall fuck them in, and tranfmit them to all the Rooms of the Houfe, as they lift. In Winter, if they be remote from the Sea, they fhut up their open Halls and Parlours, and make them clofe Apartments, by let ting down thofe Umbrelloes that fhaded them in Summer, to keep them warm in the cold Winter, till its Severity be pad, fpreading all the Floor with Quilts thick and warm, and kindling Stoves in all their Bedchambers : Thefe alfo are of a different Model from thofe nearer the Sea, They being moftly flat, Thefe arched : Their Roofs are il Hi556 The Prefent State PERSIA.

It is univerfally common to Spherical, Arched,or Plain Buildings, to lay vaft Loads of Mud at top; and what is more wonderful,only with Mud and Clay, they will rear mofi: fpacious Arches, without other matter of Afliftance; whereupon either againft Snows or Rains, fhould they continue ( which they never do long ) they would make but faint Refiftance; for being foaked thoroughly, they would re- folve into their firft Entity; Whence in great Snows, to defend and keep their Dwellings (landing, they fliovel it all from the Tops of their Houfes into the Lanes, and thereby obftrucSt the Paffagesof their mod Publick Streets, when the Snow has not fallen above two days, and alfo endanger the Foundations ; which the Rich bet ter fecure by Brick Bottoms, than the Poor, whofe Fabricks often totter on fuch occafions: However, they have a better Opportunity againft Fire, their Manfions affording little combuftible Subftance for that to feed on. The Citizens are not fo fumptuous as the Noblesand the Villages are content with Cottages, with either Plain or Arched Roofs, nei ther prefuming to exalt them to an unbecoming Height, in regard of either of their Stations: Their Cafements are latticed, not going to the Price of Glafs, which is Foreign, and for that reafon fcarce. Concluding then with thefe Tenements, we are brought to view on what Bafis their Government (lands: For the Welfare and Support of Cities, are the Obfervation of their Laws; Sains Civium in Legzhus conjiftit.

The Circumference of the Body of the City I guefs may meafure Seven Miles; but if the difperfed Gardens and Seats of the Great Men, with the Palace Royal be brought into that Computation, we muft allow it as many Pharfangs. 1 he Journy to it is difficult in Bands, Troops, or Companies, by reafon of the uneven Way encompafling every fide for many Miles together; therefore to attempt coming to it with an Army or Warlike Force, mufl: not be afcribed to Prudence of Condudror Valour, unlefs there Ihould arife another Alexander Q which muft- be imputed to his good Fortune, rather than Prowefs or Virtue } hairbrain'dly refolute to undergo no Repulfe, thothe Exterprize fur- pafs all human Probability : For it muft unavoidably fare With him literally, as it did hyperbolically only with Xerxes his Hoft, who are reported to have been fo numerous as to drink whole Rivers dry as they pafled ; what then would Cifterns of Rain-water do, or now and then a fmali Brook, to quench the Thirft even of an ordinary Detachment, not likely to put fo Populous a City in the leaft Con- flernation ? But to find Foodinfuch Bye and Defolate Paths for any confidcrable Force, would be paft poflibility, unlefs at the Expence of a Miracle. By thefe Bars, whereby the Pafles are eafily fecured (an Handful of Men being able to withftand an Hoft) and the Avenues inacceflible, the Hoftile Arms of the Turks have been put to a ftop, who other wife would have fet no Bounds to their Defires, could they have conquered thefe Obftacles, whereby they would at the fame time have carried the Empire too. The fmall Attendance we carried up to Spahaun, was demonftra- tion enough of this Truth ; for though we fared well, yet it was tirefome, and few elfe meet with the like Conveniences, they being aflured that we would more than reward their readinefs to provide for us, whereby we the better overcame thofe Straits, which prepa red an Entrance into the large Field where this invincible City lay open to us; deriving its Annual Nutriment from a clear River, which it beftows plentifully from its hollow Womb: But that which it bears the Bays away for, is its being feated in the very Heart of the Empire. For fake whereof, its Founder ( or at leaft, Adorner ) Sbaw Alas Shaw Alms the Great, advifedly chofe it for his Imperial Throne, that thence ^ adv ifc d he might more readily difperfe his Mandates, and be affifting by his of s^hmniot Auxiliaries, to any fuffering Part, aflaulted by the bold Incurfions of the imperial his Enemies ; irradiating like the Sun in the Firmament (by the In- fluence of his Power ) all within the Sphere of his Government: So that while the utmoft of his Dominions are feafonably fupplied with the comfortable Warmth of his Protection, hefafely refides within, invulnerable from Foreign Strokes,, and reigns in this his Capital City without Controul. And as the Founders of Old Rome promi- fed Eternity to their Empire as well as City, in digging up a Man's Skull, and thence, as from the beft Omen, were encouraged; as X x not m 4 * II558 The Prefent State of PERSIA.

This City has Cafar for its principal Patron ; under him the Cm y who is Prefident of the Province, or County-Sheriff, (who is ever one of the Prime Nobility, and of the higheft Rank among the Courtiers, always on Duty near the Emperor's Perfon, that he may be ready to give an account of his Charge upon demand, and at hand to introduce all Addrefles that concern hisO/Ece to reprefent j being as it were a Skreen between fo high a Majefty, and the meannefs of the Popularity under his Protection, left they fhould intrude too pro- phanely, or be ftruck blind by the too bright Rays of an Abfolute Power ) is interpofed as a fit Medium, to qualify by a fuitable Interceflion the neceflary diftance each Condition ought to be kept at, to maintain the mutual Benefit expected on both fides.

Subordinate to the forementioned Officers, is the Droger, or fheDroger, Mayor of the City, or Captain of the Watch or the Rounds: It is his Duty to prefide with the Main Guard a-nights before the Palace- Gates, and thence to make Excurfions through the City, to difperfe, fecure, and apprehend Idle and Vagrant Perfons, that can give no Account of themfelves, to punilh Offenders of that nature, and to keep the Peace. In all their Buzzars, which are locked up in the dead of the Night, there are Watches to prevent Thieves, at the common Expence of every Shopkeeper. The next in Office is the Que ft or Zygoftates, or Clerk of the Mar- Tht calenture, ket, known among them by the Title of Calenture j he fixes the Price of Corn, has the Overfightof all Bakers, Cooks, feV. and by his own Authority can not only confifcate their Goods to the Poor, but rnuld with lofs of Life fuch Offenders as are notorioufly irre claimable otherwife; many times throwing a Baker into his own Red-hot Furnace , that vends poyfonous Corn, or cheats in the Weight 5 and the Cook into his own Boiling Caldron, for impofing on the People Carrion, or ill-nourifhing Flelh, found in Highways or Ditches: Thus deals he with Malefadors of this Batch. Befides, he is Receiver of all the Rents of the City, and pays it into the King's Treafury.

But in the mean time we may obferve, That by fuch Cyclops as Spahaun the , thefe are formed the Thunderbolts of the Almighty Jove, whereby chief Empory. he both makes the whole Olympus fhake, and preferves the Laws of every private City as well as Country to which they belong. As all things by a Natural Tendency move from the Circumference to the Centre, fo from the Confluence of all Nations of the World hither, it becomes the Chief Empory, as well as an. Exemplar of their Go vernment; although it hath declined muchfince the Europeanshzve dilcovered the way by Sea to India ; For long before that it was the Storehoufe and general Market for Wares as well as its own; and by confequence, as it was the Staple of the Univerfe, it was the common Receptacle of all the Money ebbing and flowing from all Parts: But this Bofphorus being flopped, from a Sea it became a Xx 2.

However, as long as the bufy Merchant from the imermoft Coafts gapes after its Commodities to advance his Pelf, and for bis fake the Publick Buzzars are kept in better Repair than lefs-frequemed Buii- dings, it muft be allowed it is fo far from a Total Decay of Trade, that few Cities in the World furpafs it for Wealth, and none come near it for thofe (lately Buildings; which for that reafon are kept entire, while others made of Lime and Slate, belonging to private Perfons, hardly laft their Founders Lives, for want of timely Care For the Citizens rather chufe to dwellin a tottering Houfe, than appear laviih in Coflly Building or Apparel, for fear their Governors Ihould fufped they have too much Riches, when they are fure ne ver to be at reft till they have dived into the bottom of their Trea- furies ; which Extortion is returned by the King upon their Rulers, whereby the Emperors Treafure grows exuberantly great: Which is the caufe the Citizens fo often lay up their Talents in Napkins, fince it is a Crime to expofe their Wealth by fpecious or luxurious Shews, according to the accuftomed Pride of Wealthieft Corpoca- tions among us. Whence it proceeds that only Courtiers and Soldiers in this Coun try, who are maintained by Annual Penfions, are permitted to live gallantly; whofe regard of the Publick Utility is rarely fo much confidered, as to fpare any thing from their manner of enjoying themfelves, either to adorn or benefit the Cities in which they refide: On which ground it is, that their beft Cities feldom have fplendid Edifices to commend them, from mean or private Hands; though in the Suburbs of their Capital City Spahatm , there are many by the Rivers fide, both of the Nobles and the -Emperors ftately Palaces. But what celebrates it moft, are the covered Buzzars, or Market places, continued through the whole City; and the Inns of Stran gers, occupying them in the time of their Bufinefs 5 their Baths, Temples, and Convents, which have Stipends to fupport them from being an Eyefore and Blemifti in their principal Places; all which deferve a particular Defcription. And therefore I fhall begin with their Inns, or Caravan Ser Raws, which are divided into Three Species, both in refped: of their Site and Form, as well as Matter, through the whole Empire. Thofe near the Sea-lhore for SevenDays Journey or thereabouts, are com mon jy of this Figure ; they are reared Of unpoliflied Scones, on an Area Three Foot high, to keep out the Horfes, and leave an out ward Space for Servants to lye on, ^whereon are eredied Four Pillars, which fupport Four bowed Roofs, furrounding an Hemifpherical Arch in the middle, where at each fide over head are large open Windows ( or Doors rather ) to receive the Air, and at every Cor ner oi the Square, Forms within a feparate Apartment for their Men of Note, which are in open Cloyfters; and without, Four more, clofe, for thofe that connot endure the Air, or for their Women,- every Quarter has a wide Entrance or open Gate to add to its Airy- nefs; to which Inns are no Stables or fhady Places for the Beafts of Burthen, tinlefs there happen to be Trees, which is a great chance in fuch Their Cara vans.,ni a Total iv li| '' font, | ^ 3te » Won; iiV or want 4 : r for / ear fcG&gt;. ^whtlltyu: ^ N upogtbi ' abbetatb 1 All by fptci ffs and Soldiers in ti| nfions, are permj^: •k Utility isradjij ti their manWj; )f private Handiii? m ) there arewj le Emperors (li'l covered tet^sl City; and thetoii, their Bofinel^fci : Stipends to I Inns, or UrmU 30th in i the whole Emp^ ieyorthereal )fliM' ; rf uopoiidi^ ^Horfes,* reonareereif rrounding 30 ^ »over W 1 e the Air, e Air, or ^ ■eto The Prefent State of PERSIA. 5 41 uch Sandy, Wild, and Defert Places.

They modly ned in common, and obferve no didindfron among No Priority themfelves either at Church, in the Bath, or in the Caravan Ser Raw; at Church, he that comes fird, is fird ferved, none give way to another; where- by there is in the fame Inn a multitude of all forts. Footmen, Horfe- * ^ '*'&gt; men. Merchants, together with an hideous Confufion of People within, and the Noife of Beads, Packers, and Servants. Notwithdanding which, if»a Foreign Ambaifador with a great Retinue arrive, or any of their Nobles (whom they only refped as Men among them ) pitch his Tent, or take up his. Quarters with them, thefe will remove, and proffer him Room, feeking Lodgings on the Outward Lodge, or Advance-Border of the Caravan Ser Raw for themfelves; but then this mud be edeemed a great Mark of their Compliance, and indeed almod forced, they ufually domaching fuch a Didurbance with frowning Countenances, and fometimes open Revilings. This Form,after Seven Days travelling, is from an huddled Stack of Buildings expatiated into a large Square in the middle of the Area, where in the Summer-time both the Cattel and Packs are (hut in by Doors lock'd a-nights, and opened early in the Morn, to keep in the draying Troop together, and for the fafety of their Bundles, led any fhould be dollen ; In the heart of this Square is raifed a place as large as a Mountebank's Stage,where the Gelahdar, or Mader Muliteer,with his prime Paflengers or Servants, have an opportunity to view their whole Caphala. This Office in Turky is held a Place of Trud and Honour, he The GeUbd** being Captain of all the Troops going together, and hires Soldiers, notfo efteqn- and lids them in his Pay, being a ChurliftiNtfW toChridians; but the aS he is here of no other Account than to look after his Number of Bajha inTurty Mules, Camels, or Affes, and ^to fee they bring their Lading fafe where configned, and often becomes fubjed himfelf to Badinadoes on the Soles of the Feet: Whereas the other in his Journey takes upon him a kind of a Baffafhip, and never faik to lay any Mifcarri- age or Misfortune on the Bones of the Frtngi, or Franks: But it is otherwife here, becaufe of the Rhadary undertaking to fecure Tra vellers ; which is eafily done ip an entirely-fubjedled Empire, not liable to Treacherous Infults of Ravening Thieves in Companies, as they are to the Wild Arahs and other Outlaws. In Winter-time there are Stables capacious of holding Four hun dred Carriers Horfes together with their Burthens, on the backfide of little Chambers, fronting the Periflylium or Cloyder'd Entry, all black with Smoke when they retire into them in the Winter; lying elfe before them on open Cloyders, which are fo many Anticham» bers Si542 The Prefent State PERSIA. 1 Letter V. bers to every one of them, and at firfl: appearance make a Piatza were not every diftindt Arch on each fide feparated by a Party-Wall being all alike, and did not the Middle Arch of each fide make a diffe rence by a more fpacious and exalted diftindhon, each anfwering the Loftinefs of the Porch within, though that rifes higher into an afpiring fquare Tower, with lightfome Summer-Chambers aloft which makes a Magnificent Entry ; and thence the Covering of the Caravan runs on a plain Terras, convenient for the whole Number of Guefts to fpread their Carpets, Matrafles, Plads, or Beds, for lodg ing in the Night time.

There are Twenty or Thirty Fair Ones that have Incomfs, and many more whofe Mannors are devolved by a tacit Prefcript into Secular Hands. To every College there is a Prefident over the Stu dents, and another oyer the Fabrick, who lets out the Chambers, and receives the Rents, difpoftng them as he pleafes, and difplacing at pleafure: Every Chamber has One, Two, Three, or more Stu dents, where they fit and Jye; to this the ordinary Door ftancfs for a Window; there are no Forms or Benches, more than an old Moth-eaten Carpet, not fit for a Gypfy's Mantle, for to ufe, either for Repofe or other purpofe. Ihe Number of Scholars in each depends upon the Number of Chambers, and the Conftancy of the Revenues, there being in fome not above Forty, in others from an Hundred to an Hundred and fiiiy: He who is eledled into thefe, lives fparingly and iepa- rately, not eating in common Halls, having no more allowed than two or three Go sleeks a Day, which isabout'fo many Stivers or Far things, from the Prefident 5 if thefe are not enough, then he affigrfs the Tranfcription of fuch and fuch Books to his Aid, for which they are paid. There are alfo three, four, or more Servants in con- ftant Salary from the College, which any Student may of Right command to buy Fruit for their Food, and fetch them other Nece^- faries; who fometimes, Illiterate as they are, go away with fome ot the College Revenues, and are reckoned among the Students; being fitter to fhooe Horfes, or drive a Wain with Fefpafians Cha rioteer, than to (hare in that Charadjer. Their Balneos or Hummums are the moft fumptuous, which are Hummums/ in all their Cities, always hot; and it is lawful for every one of both or Sexes, on ftated times of the Day to bath for a fmall Price: The Prepofitor of each Houfe gives Notice to all Comers by blowing an Horn, when the Houies are ready to attend them ; of which there are innumerable deftined to thefe ufes, each flriving to outftiine the other ; infomuch that no time either of Day or Night pafles, but you lhall hear perpetual Noifes of Horns to irtvite you to them; for no fooner is the Fire kindled under them, but they let every one know by thofe loud Inftruments. In which Places the Treatment is alike to all; for as before was faid in the Church and Inns, fo in the Hot-Houfes all things are com mon to all: Wherefore if any one defire to be freed from the Vul gar■'1 544 The Prejent State 0/ P E R S I A. ii ■ Letter V. gar Rout, he muft hire an Houfe for a whole-Day; which maybe done, if he pay the ufual Expence and Income of that Day, which Chriftians are always obliged to, where they have not Balfteos of their own to refort to; for the Per/jaus prefume too Pharifaically orl thefeBaths, judging thereby all their Offences to be wafhed away; according to that of Laftantius , Flagitiis mnilus inquinati ven'mt &amp; femetfacrijicaffe opinantur, ft cut em laverint; tanquam lihidines iii tra peftus inclujas, ulla amnis ahluat aut maria ulla purificent: Xhey come polluted with the heinoufefl: Sins, and think when they have wafhed they have attoned by a fuflicient Sacrifice; as if any River or Sea could purify their Lufts included in their Hearts.

The Pavements are all Marble, on which, the more Hot Water is thrown, the more it increafesthe Heat, although at the fame time the Subterranean Fire be as Hot as it can be : On thefe Marble Floors they at laft extend themfelves, when they think they have tarried in long enough, that the Barbers, whofe bufinefs it is, ihould wind and turn every Limb and Joint of the Body, before, behind, and on every fide, with that Dexterity and Slight, that it is admirable to behold them perform it; whereby they leave no Mufcle, Nerve, or luperficial Joint, either unmov'd, ornotrubb'd: Then withacourfe Hair-cloth and Hot Water theyfcrape off all the Filth and Sweat; and lafl of all by a Depilatory they take clean away all manner of Hairs growing either in Secret Parts, or any Emunduary to caufe either nafty Smells, or troublefome chafing. When they retire to put on their Cioaths, ( this is to be only un- deruood of Great Men ) there waits them a Collation of Fruit Sweetmeats, and variety of Perfumes, as Rofewater, Rackbeet, and the like, with all befitting Attendants, befides the ufual Servitors to admimfter either Coho, Tea, Tobacco, or Brandy, if faint. When they are drels'd, they emplaifter their Feet and Hands with a Red Palte, which wondeffully helps fweaty and moift Palms, as alfo ninking Feet. Thefe things being premifed, the Benefits coming from theufeof thefe are, when the Body is inflamed and dried by immoderate Heat, ins finely refrefted by fweet Water, and the Pores become moiften'd; the farther profecution of which Advantages having been fpoken of &gt; before,The Prefent State of PERSIA. 545 before, I refer you thither, and proceed to the other Houfes of Re- Chap.

The Buzzars having been mentioned before, I fliall only add. That however Great all their other Buildings are, yet thefe carry away the Glory from them all; as much as the Halls of the Ci- tizens of London exceed Noblemens Houfes about the City, being the Work and Bufinefs of Joint-Stocks; and their Shews and Entertain ments are as Pompous as Princes, however fparingly they live at their own Homes: For thefe being the joint Advantage both of the Emperor and his Subjects, he encourages their forwardnefs in adorn ing thefe, though he fupprefles all their Extravagancy of Garb, or Exorbitancy in Building, if it bears not with it the becoming Defign of giving him the greateft Share of Honour in the Foundation. Their Bridges aramade either of Brick or Stone, and want neither for Skill or Ornament in their Contrivance ; and are chiefly built for Oftentation, or to preferve their Memories, as their other great Buildings are : They are of more Ufe to join divided Rocks for Paf* fengers, than to lay over Rivers; the former of which are more frequent in the Road to the Port than the otheu.

WV-w Such is the fatal neceflity of Tyrants, that leaft can credit thofe that are mod allied to them ; which addition to their Grimes they think is fomewhat extenuated by exoculating them only at this Court; whereby they are render'd uncapable of the Throne, (being to be' prefented to the Supreme Government, like the Levites in the Old Law, without Blemifh, being whole in every Member ): But cer tainly thofe are bound up in hard Circumftances, who to avoid Difputes of SuccefTion to the Crown, unmercifully butcher Tender Innocents, hurrying them to Execution as foon as they haveefcaped Imprifonment from their Mothers Womb: On this Bafis the Old Monarchy of the Perfians ms founded, as if no other Cement could fo firmly knit, as Blood. And at this Inftant their Jealoufy is fo fervent, that they keep their Sons like Captives, till the Father's Death enlarges the Eldeft; when the Younger Brothers, Uncles, and Nephews on both fides', on the Appearance of the Rifmg Sun, fee their laft: As if the Blood- Royal were prophan'd, unlefs they fled to the Hot Iron, as the only means to expiate for its Affinity; which being drawn over the mod fenfible Parts (their Eyes ), ftrikes from the Rays of their Rinfman's Diadem fuch a Sparkling Luftre, as for ever after makes them irre coverably blind ; to feek Recovery whereof, or any for them, is a Treafon unpardonable. So abhorrent are they of a Partner or a Ri val in Empire, that they endure not any to emulate or outdo them by an overforward Strain of Loyalty, whereby they might feem obliged to their Subjeds, or that they fhould outfhine them by a Popular Af- fedion, however meritorious their Deeds have been j whereby they teach their Children perfed Obedience, before they permit them to think of Command. But whether by this way it is beft;to be converfant with Toothlefs Old Women, Ignorant and Effeminate Eunuchs, a Tutor more ver- fed in Books than the Affairs of the World, and all thefe bound in the higheft Allegiance to their Liege , is a fitter Topick for the Machiavilians of our Age, than for me to handle. Although Plu tarch has delivered this as a Maxim to Pofterity, Thofe who are ge- neroufly and Princely inftruded, let them be compared with thefe, and the difference will prefently difcover itsfelf which is the more eligible Education: But for the Good of the Chief Minifters of State, it is more profitable, I confefs, to keep their Princes Judgments al ways in Minority, provided they can thereby make them more plia ble to their Ends and Defigns.

On this Account it is they have ample Lord- Ihips afligned them, which they poflefs by Inheritance and Lawful Right, with the fame Tenor as our Barons, who are before others in Wealth and Honour, but are fomething reftrained in their Power left they fhould take up Arms againft their King. The Emperor often rewards thefe with great Offices and high Employments, where he finds Defert meet with the Grandeur of their Birth ,• gracing them with his Commands the rather, becaufe (to their Eternal Renown be it fpoken ) they feldom defert their Sovereign , or prove unfaithful to the Throne: So innate a Sted- dinefs being ingrafted in their Souls, to conform themfelves to their Mafter s Wills, that they are always found obfequious; which if it be not altogether to be attributed to their Virtue, muft admit of the Dread the Anger of their Emperor imprelles ( being like the Roaring of a Lion ), which frights the trembling Herds among the Woods; for their Lives are immediately at his Difpofe, which keeps them in Awe, % .They efteem their Emperors not only as Lords Paramount, but reverence them as Sons of the Prophets , whofe Dominion therefore is grounded more on Hierarchy than bare Monarchy. For as of old the Ferfians adored the Sun as a Deity, and celebrated his rifing with Morning Hymns, and were daily employed in Sacred An thems to its Praife; fo now from Idolaters becoming Infidels, they Hill efpoufe the Divine Right as well as Lineage of their Sovereigns: From which fond Belief, the Potenteft General at the Head of a PuiHant Army, or the Provincial CaunSy though furrounded with Legions of Soldiers , upon the Arrival of a fingle Chuper ( that is, a Poft with Royal Order), attended with no other Warrant than being one of the Kings Creatures 9 and he pronouncing Death from the Emperor, they lay down their Heads without any Tumult, with an entire Refignation to their Mafter s Pleafure. And what is yet more ungrateful to men of their Jealoufy, (it being fo bafe and diihoneft, that no Reparation can be made among the Moors for an Indignity of that kind) if he commands them on the great Feftival ( begun by Ahafuerus^ and continued to this Day by the Pet pan Monarchs, a a Hundred and Fourfcore Days every \ ear ) to bring their own proper Wives to Court, to remain there all that time proftitute to his Luft j this fo hated a thing they are fo far from reruung, that they obey him in every thing, no lefs than an Immortal God.

Inthefe, as in their other Speculations, they cleave fopertinacioufly to their Books and undoubted Authors, as if it were piacular to de^ part from their Traditions. They fancy to themfelves a Chimerical Creation of the World by Ten Intelligencies, which by the fame inexpugnable Reafon paffes in to their Creed ; and being freight with this Notion, they fay, from one moll fimple Caufe can proceed no more than one Effed; and therefore God framed the firft Intelligence, and that mediating the Firft Heaven, and fo in their fubaltern order to the Tenth/ That the World was many Ages before Adam and Eve, (our firft Mctaphyfieks, Parents Edudion out of the Earth) Inhabited by Devils; and that the PoffefTion thereof wasfo longentrufted in their Hands, till they had extirminatecf the true Worfhip of God (which at fir ft they applied themfelves Rcligioufly to obferve) and gave themfelves up to Uncleannefs and Prophanenefs; when Man was Created in their room, and they caft out of any farther Pofleftion, and Men took their Places.

' They acknowledge Four kinds of Caufes, viz. Material, Formal, Efficient and Final; they allow not of an exemplary, but admit of a total Caufe ; by which they underftand fuch an one as no conditi on is defedive to put it into Ad; and on thefe Foundations they fuppofe the World's Creation from Eternity to be enough proved. The Books cf greateft vogue, are thole of Corge Nejir TuJ/r, of Books irs the City Tufs, in the Province of Korafam, wrote Five hundred eem, years ago; he, as it is credible, underftood the Greek Lan guage as well as others ; from whence he has explained fome Anci ent Authors, as Euclid^ Ptolomys Alguma and Opticks, and has re* duced them into a Compendium , as alfo the Works of Flato.

Who leaving Natural Caufes, declares thefe Secrets were Revealed to him: That The Winds were raifed by an Angel's moving his Wings. The Flux and Reflux of the Sea wascaufed by an Angel 's putting his Foot on the middle of the Ocean, and comprefiing the Waves, the Waters ran t;o the Shores, which being removed, they retired to their proper ftation. Falling Stars are the Firebrands wherewith the Good Angels drive away the Bad when they are too fawcily inquifitive, and ap proach too near the Empyreum (the Virge of the Heavens) to hearken to, and eves-drop the Secrets there. Thunder is nothing elfe but the Cracking, of an Angel's Whip, while he flafhes the dull Clouds to fuch and fuch a place, where Rains are wanting to make the Earth fertile and remedy its Drinefs. Eclipfes, he delivers, happen not by the mutual Interjedion of the Heavenly Bodies, but that the Sun and Moon are fliut in a Pipe (a Cupboard as well) and turned up and down, and that from each Pipe is a Window by which they enlighten the World; but when God is angry at the Inhabitants thereof for their Tranfgrefli- ons, he bids an Angel clap to the Window, and turn the Lights towards Heaven from the Earth; then the Light is taken away from the unworthy Mifcreants, and an Eclipfe is made; for which occafi- on he has left them Forms of Prayers to be ufed by the Mahometans-, that God would be pleafed to avert his Judgments and reftore Light to the World. In an Eclipfe of the Moon they beat Pots and Pa # ns, or any other brazen Inftrument, as in time of Idolatry it was a pre vailing Cuftom, even in Europe ( as well as here and in India ) which ftill fome ignorant Old Women, and the dregs of the People are ready enough to continue; for the Tradition was handed down to them, wherewith they were feduced of Yore, that the Moon might be Inchanted, and unlefs it were roufed up by this Noife would certainly fall down dead afleep upon the Earth from Heaven. .

But this is but a Story, however poiitive they are, fince it was a Cuftom all the World over fbrtg before. Their Thick-fcull'd Prophet has fet another Angel at work for Earthquakes, who is to hold fo many Ropes tied to every Quarter of the Globe; and at God's Command, he is, to pull and fo (hakes that' part of the Globe; and if a City, Mountain, or Tower, be to be overturned, then he tuggs harder at the Pulley, tijl the Rivers dance and the Valleys are filled with Rubbilh, and the Water fwallow.ed up in the Precipices. Such Stuff as this he has abundance of; and the mod impartial Interpreter of the Alcoran, as the Mahometans themfelves confefs, can afford no better: But for all that they hold that it contains profound meanings; for it has feveral degrees of Senfes, the fecond of which it is hardly' poflible for the greatefl: Dodor to apprehend ; wherein are couched Words of fuch efficacy, which if they were pronounced by Unpolluted Lips, and whoever fhould underftand them and Pray, might both Raife the Dead and work Miracles; and that of an unqueltioned truth this Book came from God, as both the Fcecundity of Sitile, and admirable Eloquence doth feftify. For they are not afraid prophanely to fay. That God accommodated his Miffion's to Place, Age, and the exigency of Times; in the Days of Chrift there w^fe excellent Phyficians, Irlenus, i. e. Galen, Vkhagor, Fcckate, Ajflaton, (prodigious Re concilers of Time! ) ail thefe Healed Difeafes by their Plants and Herbs; but God to outdo thefe, gaveChrift Power to Raife thofe from the Dead who had been Buried ; acknowledging withal, that this Prophet exceeded the degree of meer Man, When Mofes lived , many Magicians and Cunning Men were entertained by Pharaoh \ God therefore gave Mofes a more wonder ful Art, that his Serpent Ihould devour theirs, whereby they were compelled to own him fent from God. And now to nick Mahomet, when he had the Impudence to let up for a Prophet, Oratory was in its full perfedion; therefore Ma homet, by the Miniftration of the Angel brought forth the Chapters of his Alcoran ; which when he had propoied to the ^Wlleft Men of that Age to pronounce but Three or Four tbereoi , and they not being able, were forced to confefs, that 1 hat Work mufi be certainly of God, {Ince they knew Mahomet to be il.'iterate; which he relates in his Alcoran, and takes thence an opportunity to boaft, undervaluing the Ffalms of the mean while ( w ica are David's PCalms ) becaufe they know not with what Figures ot v Words and Sentences they are Illuminated, nor with what vehe- mency they incite a Devout Soul; that the Ferfian Interpreter, could he exprefs the Numbers and Elegancies of Speech contained ^^66 TheFrifent State PERSIA.

He denied the Trinity, affirming it to be ridiculous to believe Chrift to be God ,• wherefore with Socinus and Eumenius, he allowed him to be only a Creature, hut with Carpocrates, an Holy Prophet. He held with Cedren, that it was a thing impoffible that God Ihould Beget a Son who never had a Wife. With the Manachites he would not have Chrifl Crucified, but ano ther fo like him that he could not be diftinguiftied. With the Difciples of Origen, he held that after a Revolution of time the Devils might be Sav'd ;afcribing with the Anthropomorphites, Members and Human Shape to the Deity ; placing, with Cerinthus* all Felicity in Pleafure.

And this muft ever be the ftate of thofe Kingdoms where Goodnefs is baniQied, and Virtue muft give place to Vice; and this unavoidably happens where ever the Mahometan Religion takes place; which makes a voluptuous Life the only Benediction both on Earth and in their Heaven; and this fquares more peculiarly with the Climat and the Temper of the Perfians, than any other Nation un der the cope of Heaven : For fince Misfortunes are looked on as the moft grievous Gurfes, they all aim either to be, or to be thought Profperous; whence it is not only indecent, but unhappy to walk on Foot out of Neceflity; and he that comes abroad with the fineft Palfry, the richeft Accoutrements, the moft Followers, with Foot men with Bells at their Waftes, Feathers in their Turbats, Em broidered Horfe-Cloaths over their Shoulders, delicately wrought Saddles for War and Houfings, Golden Bridles, Breaft-Plates and Cruppers often befet with Precious Stones ^ has his Golden Headed Coleon behind him magnificently carried, with change of Vefts in rich Buy-Shoes or Portnaantles; he is the Favourite ot Heaven and the Darling of Fortune, is courted by all, and efteemed the chief care of Providence.

Their Diet. And therefore is it neceflary, that to the excellency of the Air, and difpofition of the Body, a requifite Diet, as well for Meat as Drink, fliould correfpond with both; and indeed Nature feems to have provided them with both, for thofe they defire arethefe: caM. CaMis Roftmeat on Skewers, cut in little round pieces no bigger than a Sixpence, and Ginger and Garlick put between each. Thus fparingly do they feed on Flefli alone, ordered after ^his manner; and if at any time they intend a Meal thereon, they have it well Boiled, Baked, Fried, or Stewed, or made into Pu//ow ; which is a general Mefs, as frequent with them as a good fubftantial piece of Beef is with us, and reckoned their {landing Difli ; which is made either of Flefh, Filh, or Fowl, as the Indian Moors do ; but the beft is made of the fatteft Meat, for which the pondrous Tails of Suet (which their Sheep bear) is mod coveted, in regard it faves Butter. phUow . To make Pullow, the Meat is firfl Boiled to Rags, and the Broth or Liquor being ftrained, it is left to drain, while they Boil the Rice in the fame ; which being tender, and the aqueous parts evaporating, the Juice and Gravy incorporates with the Rice, which is Boiled almoft dry ; then they put in the Meat again with Spice, and at laft as much Butter as is neceflary, fo that it becomes not too Greefy or Of- fenfive, either to the Sight or Tafle; and it is then Boiled enough when it i^fittobe made into Gobbets, not flabby, but each Corn of Rice isfwclledand filled, not burft into Pulp; and then with Mamo or other Achar, they will devour whole Handfuls (for Spoons are not in ufe, unlefs to drink Sherbet with, they mixing their Pottage with dry Rice, and cramming themfelves with their Fingers ) and never Surfeit; al ways taking tiiis for a Rule, never to Drink till they are fatisfied, it oadvag them otherwife to fwell too foon; and then they will Eat as much at a Meal, as an HorTe or Mule can of fiarly, Dumpoke.

Sherbets are made of almoft all Tart pleafing Fruits as the Juice of Pomegranets, Lemmons, Citrons, Oranges, Prunella s, which are to be bought in the Markets.

The day after the Sun was poflefled of the /kqui~ tiox, we made the Tropick of Capricorn, from whence the Platomfis feign the Souls defcend upon the Earth ; but more truly it decla red that we drew near the Coafts of Africa ; for having hitherto meafured a Southern Way almoft directly, we now incline towards the Weft, having not more Meridional diftance from Joanna than Nine Degrees ; but now we begin to bend our Courfe Weftward, which we fhould do in a ftrait Line, were it not for St. Lawrence, theoutfide whereof our Navigators always pafs by homeward bound, it lying Twelve Degrees South, to Six and Twenty and an half, which we fuppofe to be Three hundred Leagues Weft of us, though here being a ftrong Current to the Weft, it^makes our Judgment very unfteady ; however to make the Cape, it is neceffary to ele vate our Longitude more than our Latitude, which we did till we had made Fourteen Degrees Weft from our fuppofed Meridian of Joanna, whereby we reckon our felves clear of the Ifland Madagaf- car, or as the Portugals call it, Sr. Lawrence ; when the Eaft Wind failed us, and the Weft blew hard upon us, contrary to theafiertion of the forementioned Author; the Winds, as we formerly Noted, beyond the Tropicks being unaccountable, for that they obferve no Rule » and hereupon it happened we were fo long beating about the Cape, and had been much longer, had we not made for the Shore j which we did about the middle of Aprtlj when it is high Winter in thefe parts, wherein we tried all Weathers, the worft of which were Calms, according to our Englijh faying, Worfe is a Winters Calm, By far than Summers Storm. Which we fuffered till we got under the Shore, whence we were WeWe«t« affifled with fine Briezes , we falling firft in with Cape et Aguthas the low Land being bare and naked, the high Land, a Ridge ot Mountains only gaping in one place, from which the 0 Tl u ^ s gave it the name ^ Agutha, or of theNeedles: Fifteen Miles North ward of it lies the Promontory called Cape Falfa , which we wea thered in the Morning, and afore Night did thehketothe Cape of GW Hope, which in refped of the Heavenly Pofition is 34 Degrees and a half South Latitude, Longitude 47, in a r 1 from Joanna 1800 Leagues.

When going afhore, the Guns roared, and the Governor Mr. John Blackmore received us on the Beech, which was ftony and troublefome afcending; we palled through Rows of Soldiers, called to their Arms on this o^cafion, into a Valley furrounded with high Mountains, except towards the Sea, where flood the Fort and Platform for the great Cannon, which reach farther than there is any Anchor-hold, fo that no Ships can come in, or endure their Force, without their Leave. Notwithibnding which, it is yet frefli in memory, that the Dutch landing on the backfide of the Ifland, gained the Tops of the Hills, and invading the Ifland, drove the Englijh from their Fort, for all they had two Ships in the Road at the fame time, which did no n r /r/r F. 6 t * lan c . arr y the Inhabitants, leaving the Dutch in Ponenion, till Captain Munday by the King's Command was fentouc to retake it that very Year we came out for India ( which was the veryOur Return to ENGLAND. 423 very Fleet that fet out with us, and bore us company to St. lagoy, Chap.
