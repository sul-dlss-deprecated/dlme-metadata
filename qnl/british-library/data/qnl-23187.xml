Dated the § 7/i May 1929. The Adyicer, Bahrein Governnont, Bahrein. Meraorandun . I have recently been looking through the files of the Trust Funds that have been created for you, and Messrs Parke and deGrenier, and the following fact has attracted ny attention. i I notice thAt with apparently one exception, all the securities that have been purchased for these accounts have been of income tax free stock. Mr. Belgrave^ Trust on 3/5/28 free stock to the face value of He. 1300/- was purchased at a price of Rs.100/12/- % which amount was subsequently increased to Rs.4700/-. On 5/12/28 Rs.2300/- of the sane stock at ■ 'IP Rs.108/2/- was purchased. In Mr. deGrenier’s Trust an amount of Re. 1500/I s * worth of the same stock was bought and a price of Rs. 108/8/-J| % paid for it. On 10/4/29 however Rs.1400/- worth of stock was bought but there was no mention of*this having been Tax free, and the price was Rs.103/12/- ^ • My point in mentioning all this is that it appears to me that income tax free stock is not the best investment available for you, as you are not liable to Indian income tax and the extra premium that income tax freefree stock naturally connande,is^ln your case an absolute waste of noarly 5 ^ of your capital. You will goo from the cutting of tlio noct rooont Indian paper that I have received that you oan obtain *45 - ’55 stock paying the sane 5% for 102j and it would appear adviGable for you to coll out of the tax free ctock and invest in this, or say the 5^ 1935. If you would like to take the advico of your bank, perhaps you would Mtee^^tno consult Mr. doGrenier, and if he shares my views both your Trusts night be dealt with simul taneously. Captain Parke would be left over till his return. Captain, . t Political Agent, BahreinNo. IS 51/ of 1347 Office of /the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain, Dated, 25th Dil Haj 1347 T H. B. M T s Memorandum Political Bahrain. Mr. deGrenier and I are very much obliged to you for interesting yourself in the matter of our Provident Fund stock. I have discussed the matter with him and we both appreciate the soundness of your suggestion that as we in no case pay income tax there is no necessity to purchase free from income tax stock, which is at a higher price than ordinary stock. The only point which Mr. deGrenier questions is v/hether, if we transferred to ordinary stock, income tax would be deducted at source. Can you tell me whether is done in India, and if so would claims for repayment of the tax be made by the Hon’ble the Resident, as Trustee, or by ourselves as beneficial owners? If tax is not deducted at source, we both wish the stock to be changed to ordinary stock, liable to tax. We thank you very much for the suggestion. Adviser to the Government, Bahrain.No. Of 1929.

Si ir, 'Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain Financial Adviser’s Account' and 'Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain Assistant Adviser’s Account' With reference to your endorsement No. 1023 of 24th august 1929, I have the honour to inform you that while going through these two accounts, I notice that a sum of Rs 1,200/- (Six instalments) which ought to have been placed to the credit of Captain Parke’s Provident Fund account, has been wrongly credited to my account, and that the sum total has been invested in Government of India Securities. I have seen the relative covering letters, with which the cheques used to be sent, and find that they are all in order. Apparently, it is a clerical error on the part of the Bank, at the time of entering the items in the passbooks. R Lr\ Ik XCantsin Parke’s account shows a similar deficiency of Rs 1,200/-, whihh proves that the sum is mis-entered. The wrong items are.- Paymente for Shawaal, ’46, entered in the passbook, of my account, on . 24th May, 1926 Rs 200/- — do — D.Qad, entd on 8 th June 28 - 200/- — do — D.Haj, ' 7th July - 200/- — do — Mahram ” 16th Aug - 200/- — do — Safer ” 1st Septr - 200/- — do — J.Thany ,f 27th Deer. - 200/- Six instalments - Rs 1,200/-. The error could be easily rectified by a transfer from one account to the other, but for the question of interest. Perhaps the Bank will be able to calculate the appropriate amount of interest for the period and settle the affair. In this connection I would draw your attention to the fact that the various expen- ses in meking investments etc. incurred by the Bank and debited to the accounts exceed the whole compound interest on the capital. If this money, instead of being invested were placed on Fixed Deposit at 5^, which rate could probably be obtained, the fund would benefit yearly, and it would not have incurred the expenses amounting to hs 636/9/8, on commissions, etc., in my account.— c-/ I enclose herewith copies of worksheets, which explain the error referred to.
