I enclose herewith a oopy of his letter referred to above and revest that you will Vindly peruse the same and consider the position of the man so that no loss may result to him. The Government Inshallah will not do anything unjust because they are Just and merciful.

Four years ago we requested the late Shaikh Mubarak to obtain a letter from the British Consul at Kuwait (in the time of Colonel Crey) to the Commissioner in Sind informing that we were the Shaikh's agents. The letter was duly received 'by us and forwarded to the Commibssioner, and on the strength of this letter we received, and are still rec^ivinr, much assistance from the Commissioner in all matters. And now accord ing to your orders we are doing your business and that of your sub jects. I have to explain to Tour Excellency that since last 4 years the Government is taking from me a tax which in the first year was Rs.52/- second year ds.452/- and third year Rs.SSOO/-. I Had gone for a change and was not present in Karachi when these taxes were demanded and they were paid by my sons in mu absence, when I rtib urned I saw that payments had already been made and I did not therefore like to trouble Jrour Excellency and charged the amounts to my own account. I did not know that Government would claim this year a larger amount of income tax such as Hs.d375/- and super tax of Rs*6400/- Total Rs.15775 When I saw this demand I was greatly pepplexed and did not know why it was raised to this figure. I paid the tax for the last 3 years because it was small amounts but as the sum claimed now is a Mg one I cannot pay it without informing ^our Excellency so that you may know and make some arrangement with the Political Agent, Kuwait. 3uch tax is not taken from others in Karachi. Tour Excellency knows that the business I do is not min© only but also of other merchants from whom 1 I get the customary commission. \ 1 enquired of the Collector of Income Tax why the amount is claimed from me and told him that I was the Agent of the Ruler of Kuwait and of Kuwait merchants and that if he did not know this he' not Irnow anything and asfced what my intentiond were, I replied that I wanted one months time 30 that I could inform lour Excellency and this he granted me, I now request thatto Your Excellency will Vindly see into this matter and settle it with ths Political Apent # Fuwait, We are unable to pay the amount and us the grace days will shortly expire early orders may be issued so that we may not lose more by delay.1-7100 -h Note.

The loss ensuing therefrom “t Revenues and private incomes is a matter which for many years tto 1 itself unpleasantly to the notice of both Government and the /OwninjL -&gt;^ sses * ( While Government Officers have been alive to the importance of combat- jing the locust evil, no satisfactory means of checking the invasions of these hsects or of minimizing the damage done by them have hitherto been arrived it in this country while the failure of such measures as have been taken has only confirmed and strengthened the popular belief that locust plagues are sent by Providence and endeavours to combat them are both futile and sacrilegious. Not only has the co-operation of the people in such endeavours been half-hearted and ineffective, but zemindars have looked passively on at the destruction even in cases where it was easy to check or prevent it. The locust invasion of the Quetta-Peshin District in 1901 was one cf a '^lore than ordinary severity, and the opportunity was taken of once more endea- mring to find some means of satisfactorily dealing with the question. Ihe :iole energies of the district staff were devoted to a series of operations against these insect invaders and satisfactory to state these operations led to extremely ^ successful results. It has been suggested to me that 1 should place on record a detailed memorandum of the experiences gained, and this 1 now do in the hope that such a memorandum may be of some use to others who have to contend against locusts. 1 could find very little on record that was of any assistance. I found in my own and other offices in Quetta printed papers to show that in ^ some places in the Punjab large quantities of eggs had been dug up, and that in Cyprus locusts had been exterminated by an elaborate and somewhat expen sive scheme of screens lined with American oil cloth, and pits lined with polished zinc round the top. It was clearly impossible to carry out the Cyprus arrangements in a poor and sparsely populated country like Baluchistan, where there is no indigenous wood for strengthening and supporting screens, and where very high winds blow in the spring which would blow down anything but the strongest structure. To the Cyprus experiments, however, we are indebted for the proof of the efficacy of American cloth as a surface over which locusts cannot crawl. Value of oil cloth. J 2. Having ascertained by experience that a narrow strip of American oil cloth*forms an impassable obstacle to the crawling locust, 1 made a number of experiments to find out the cheapest and most effective way of using this material. 1 will try to describe what appear to me the uses to which the cloth can be put. Quetta-Peshin is-largely a fruit growing country, where the oil cloth was used no garden was damaged, but where no oil cloth was used, I believe that I am correct in saying that no garden which was attacked escaped. A comparison of the revenue remissions and suspensions in 1901 (a) with those O) Rs. i * ma( f e in iS97 (/;) when locusts last appeared in the district show conclusively (?,) r 3 . i that a great deal can be done to defeat crawling locusts. Melons are a very valuable crop, but in many places the people, with the experience of the pastbe .ore them, wlrld not take the tronble to sow melons because they they would be eaten up by locusts, as a unatter of fact I only heard of t\ patches of melons, being destroyed in 10')1 in the whole district. I these facts to show that the victory gained over the locusts was a ven tical one. There is a consensus of opinion that locusts were more numerous i. than in 18 ! J7, and the basis of revenue assessments in this district is one-si of the gross value of the crop. Of the Us. 3,'J01 suspended in 1807, I ha traced Us. 3,000 in one Sub-Division as having been subsequently remitte and no doubt some damage might have been done in many places for wkic neither remissions nor suspensions were given. Government gardens an&lt; Muafi property were also damaged, but these do not appear in the revenu accounts. It may therefore be calculated that at the lowest comj^iP’*^' property saved by the use of the oil cloth, amounted to Us. (&gt;2,244. 1897 Revenue remissions and suspensions Rs. 11,991 at g i of ^ produce :— , r ^ Damage to property ... Rs. 71,940. 1901 Revenue remissions and suspensions Rs. 1,617 at Jth of gross produce— Damage to property ... Rs. 9,702. Difference ••• ,, 62,214 3. I am not surprised that scarcely anyone could be found who would^. believe that locusts were not invincible, for no one had seen oil cloth used, a: 0 it is my firm conviction that without this little or nothing could have been doL ( to save crops and gardens. The Political Agent, Kalat, told me that the wholej the Kalat army had not been able to save Ihe Khan’s,garclen. An officer of the 23rd Bombay Rifles told me that it had been found impossible, even with the aid of regular troops to save a small garden at Port Sandeman, and the few trees that there are at Nushki were completely eaten, in spite of all efforts to save them. 4. Oil cloth to be effective should be practically perpendicular, or over hanging in the direction from which the locusts come. I generally used a strip) . five 'inches wide because this allowed a large margin for safety, which is needed when the person using the cloth is not moderately careful and intelligent. I, however, in some cases used strips only 2-| inches with complete success. 1 do not recommend the use of a narrower strip than 5 inches because a strong wind from behind will help locusts over a narrow strip, and at any re-entering angle it is an easy jump from below the cloth on one side of the angle to above the elotli on the other side of the angle. Another strong reason for having a margin of safety is that when the oil cloth is used with success it proves a most profit able investment, while if it is used without success, its cost is so much moneys thrown away. ,, Methods of using oil cloth. 5. Oil cloth can be used in three ways (1) on walls (2) round the tops of ditches or pits (3) on mat screens. Oil cloth on walls. C. On walled enclosures the oil cloth can be nailed along the walls but this damages the oil cloth for future use ; if the walls are rough and in bad repair it will be found that the locusts can find a way between the oil cloth and the wall, and oil cloth by itself cannot be used in ditches. For this reason it was found better to sew the oil cloth five inches wide along a stripof common country cloth about 17 inches wide, in such a way that on one side of the oil cloth there appeared 2 inches of country cloth and on the other side 10 inches. The object of leaving uneven widths of common cloth on either side of the oil cloth will be described later on. The oil cloth is made in lengths of 36 feet, and if a walled garden is protected on all sides by oil cloth it only requires a little care to see that the edges of adjoining pieces are accurately joined This however is an extravagant way of obtaining pro tection, for a garden is seldom attacked from all directions at once. It is also a method that I did not encourage, for a man who has fully protected himself will take no trouble to kill the locusts, and is apt to be content to see them turn from his garden to the unprotected property of someone else. It is far better to line only the side from which the attack comes, and to kill the locusts. This is easily done, for when the locusts find that they cannot advance up the wall they turn to the right or left and go along the w'all till they come to the corner. This is the place to kill them. All that is needed is a ditch (2' wide by 2' deep) dug at right angles to the walls, and lined all round the top with oil cloth: a couple of boys are quite sufficient to drive the locutsts into the ditch. Mat screens can be used instead of a ditch, and if used as described further on, one screen is sufficient for the two walls that form a corner. Where only one wall is lined with oil cloth vertical strips are required at the corners to prevent the locusts from crawling along the walls past the ditch. To ensure that the locusts shall not be able to jump from the wall over the ditch the vertical strip should he placed as shown in the attached drawings (No 2) at least IS' from the outer edge of the ditch. Oil cloth round ditches. 7. The oil cloth can also he used round the edges of ditches or pits. Ditches not so lined are of very little use. It has been recommended that the oil cloth should not be sewn in the middle of the cotton cloth, the reason is that a considerable width of cotton cloth is needed to enable the strips to be used in ditches. In ditches the cloth cannot be nailed up, but it can easily be kept in position by throwing the earth from the ditch on to the cotton cloth and allowing the oil cloth to remain hanging as near as possible vertical. A drawing* is attached to explain this. Along line might of course be defended by an equally long ditch edged with oil cloth, but this would require a great deal of labour and considerable expenditure. My experience is that locusts march in detachments and collect in considerable bodies in the evening, and that it is easier to attack each detach ment separately than to attempt any general line of defence. A ast numbers yTere destroyed in ditches edged with oil cloth, but it was found that the soil was sometimes too hard to allow of ditches being properly dug, and at all times the men digging the ditch took a considerable amount of valuable time over the work, while they frightened away the locusts by the noise they made. There was a double disadvantage in this, in the first place the locusts had to be drivenback a longer distance and in the second place they had to be driven in a direction in which they did not wish to go. Mat Screen. 8. To obviate these difficulties a mat screen was used (Figures 4 to 8). This was made of ordinary “ Chattai ” 15 or 18 inches wide, along one edge of which a strip of oil cloth was sewn so that it covered the top edge of the screen and also the edges at the two ends. These screens were made 36 feet in length as that is the greatest length in which the oil cloth can be bought, they were stiffened at intervals of nine feet by a split bamboo on either side of the screen, those on the plain side were as along as the screen was wide, and those on the lined side only reached up to the edge of the oil cloth. From the top of the larger bamboo was another short piece of split bamboo on a pivot so that it could be made to force the top of the screen to slightly over hang.( * ) The screen was also furnished with cords at the ends to enable two screens to be closely joined, or to enable one screen to be used in the form of a circle. The screens can be used as wings to a ditch, or as projection from a walled enclosure in place of a ditch. The former method requires no explanation beyond a remark that if the screens are to be used in this way they should be provided with strips of oil cloth at each end running the whole width of the screen ; without this the locusts will walk round the screen to the back of it and so avoid the ditch. The screen can be used as a substitute for a ditch most effectively. As I have said the locusts lie in patches or travel in detachments with the help of a couple of tent pegs the screen can be noise lessly and quietly put up in the form of a circle at any selected spot close to the locusts or in their line of march. It will be found that, the insects readily climb up the outside of the screen and jump into the circle from which they cannot climb out, they can also be assisted to get inside by placing a small stone under the screen at the point the locusts approach, a large number will be entrapped in this way before they attempt to use the space thus made as an exit and when they do so the stone can be removed in a moment. In the absence of walls this is the most effective means that I know of destroying locusts. It can be used on any soil, and no time is wasted either in digging ditches or driving the locusts a distance. To carry out any of these plans some men are of course required, but with the help of the screen half a dozen boys will be able to do more than could be done by ten times that number of men without oil cloth. Cost of oil cloth &amp; screens. 9. Owing to the want of previous knowledge, the oil cloth, cotton cloth, and matting had to be bought in haste, &amp; the oil cloth was brought from Bombay by passenger train. In spite of this the cost was as stated below :— A strip of oil cloth 36 feet long &amp; 5 inches wide ... Rs. Ill 0 A similar strip sewn on cotton cloth about 17 inches wide „ 2 7 0 A mat screen with oil cloth and bamboos ,, 5 0 0 These prices include sewing charges, and they gave a sufficient margin of profit to allow of nails for putting up the strips on walls being given free. At first two or three strips of oil cloth were given to the zemindars of the various circles free of cost, but when the people recognised the value of it they willingly bought it at the prices above named to the value of Rs. 1,700. % Running Water. 10. In some places water was used as a means of destroying locusts. My experience is that still water is of no use whatever, but this is not the case with running water, I doubt if running water in sandy soil would be of any use as it would not be possible to maintain perpendicular banks. In this district all the running water is found in artificial channels which are in soil that will stand perpendicular for an inch or two. This is sufficient. If the bank where it meets the water is cleared of every vestige of vegetation and dug with a spade so that an inch or two above the water are practically perpendicular it will be found that locusts cannot get up it. The reason is that the locust cannot jump from the water and when he tries to get a grip of the bank with his front legs his hind legs are carried away by the stream. At intervals down the stream a man should be posted to hold a basket or sieve in the water. The water will pass through and the locusts will remain in the basket, they can then be thrown in pits near where the man is standing, it will be found that they are not at all active after a few' moments’ immersion in the water, especially when during those few' moments they spend their energies in struggling with each other.If there are water mills actually at work on the stream there is no need to post men with baskets, except on sanitary grounds, for the locusts are killed when they go down the mill stream. In this case it must be remembered that the mill buildings and trees on the mill stream form convenient bridges which should be guarded. One day I noticed numbers of locusts jumping into a rather swift stream which ran over a rough stony bottom ; the pace of the stream, the ripples caused bv the rough bottom, and a wind that was blowing against the stream caused the surface of the water to be slightly ruffled. No locusts crossed the stream though it was little more than afoot wide, and they appeared very soon to be rendered absolutely helpless It has since occurred to me that a number of artificial falls made on a stream might be very useful. A fall of an inch or so could easily be arranged by placing boards across the stream, at each fall the locusts would be driven under water; there would be a tendency for the locusts to collect immediately below the fall and they are great adepts at drowning each other. If running water is being used a few men should be constantly employed to patrol the bank and see that there are no weak places in the line of defence at which the locusts can cross. Flying locusts (old). 11. A few remarks on locusts in their various stages of growth may perhaps be useful. Locusts first appeared in large flights of full grown insects. They stayed for some time and appeared to be doing no harm, so no efforts were made to destroy them or to drive them off. This was a great mistake, for the flying locusts remained long enough to deposit their eggs and then flew away. The Civil Surgeon took great interest in the preparation of the South African locust fungus, and a Hospital Assistant was put on special duty for this work, but as far as I could ascertain the fungus though freely used on locusts at all stages of their growth was a complete failure. 1 know of no effective remedy against the flying locust. In this climate large numbers can be killed in the early mornings when they are stiff on account of the cold, and in any climate the locusts must be quite helpless when they are laying their eggs, at this time the males and females are firmly coupled together. The best thing to do is to kill as many as possible and to drive off the rest. In the Hying stage they are easily driven on. The advantages of driving off flying locusts are (1) that they are got out of the crops (2) that if thoroughly harassed they may by a fortunate chance be disturbed just at the time that they want to lay their eggs, and these are said not to be fertile unless they are laid in suitable ground, and unless the female locust is able to bury them about an inch, and a half deep in the soil, (3) that if eggs are to be laid it is better to have them laid at distance from cultivation. In a sparsely cultivated country like this the young locusts may grow big enough to fly before they reach any crops. Destruction of Eggs. 12. If eggs have been laid they should be dug up. This remedy was adopted in Peshin with great success. Mahomed Rafiq Khan who was in charge of the operations in a portion of Peshin, tells me that the people soon get very expert at this work, and that in some villages where enormous quantities of eggs were dug up scarcely any young locusts appeared. At one place the land was ploughed up soon after the eggs had been laid. Unfortunately no accurate record was kept of the area ploughed and the exact spots in which the young locusts were hatched so it is impossible to express a decided opinion^ on the value of ploughing. I have consulted a number of people whose opinion should carry weight, and they mostly think that the ploughing did have an appreciable effect. The eggs hatch about three weeks after they are laid, and the young locusts fiist appear as tiny white insects unable to move. At this stage they aie veiy diffi cult to see and no attempts were made to kill them. It is just possible that a harrow run over the ground would effectually bury them.( « ) Black Crawling Locusts. 13. In a very few days these white helpless insects turn into blnck hopping creatures about the size of a large ant. In this stage they are difficult to manage, they cannot move in the early morning and as soon as the sun gets hot they are unwilling to move At any time of day it is almost impossible to drive them in any given direction. It will be found that black locusts, both in the early morning and m the heat of the day collect in swarms on and under the small bushes that afford them shelter. We first tried to kill them by beatiny them with brooms and bundles of thin sticks or the flat side of a spade. This entailed great labour and was not effective, as a large proportion of those in each swarm attacked contrived to escape. A number of cheap thm syringes were then made and kerosine oil was squirted on to the swarms. This was found so effective that some of the zemin dars employed this method at their own expense. lam inclined to think that a syringe and very cold water, which could, in Quetta, always be obtained in the early springt morninys, might so numb the black locusts that they could easily be killed If the hlack locusts actually get into standing crops the only thing we found of any use was to drive them with great patience into one corner of the field, scatter :ibout some ker* sine with a syringe, and set fire to that portion of the crop. Kerosine oil will kill the black locusts, but if fire is used a good deal of oil is saved. Black and Yellow Locusts. 14. After a few davs the blacky locusts become black and yellow. As they become yellow they become more active and more easy to drive. When they have passed the black stage, oil cloth and running water are the only remedies. Flying Locusts (young). 15. Some days after becoming almost yellow the young locusts turn a pinkish colour and obtain the use of their wings. They do nor. appear possible to attack at this stage, but fortunately they can be easily driven off. Orders recommended for issue when Locusts appear:— 16. Should locusts again appear in this district, I recommend to my suc cessors the adoption of the following measures, in the order in which they are noted below 1. Kill flying locusts (old) in the early mornings, and drive off what are not killed. 2. As an experimental measure plough land where eggs have been deposit ed, but where possible dig up the eggs and destroy them by burial or burning. 3. Keep an accurate record of laying grounds and dates of laying, 4. 'Fry cold water on the black locusts in the early morning and if that fails, use kerosine oil. 5. Knowing the localities where young locusts exist and where cultivation exists, if there is a stream between the two, have the banks close to the water abso lutely cleared of all vegetation and cut vertical and tell people to patrol the stream, and use baskets unless there are mills.( r ) 9. Use all your influence to make the people work together. 10. Discourage the people from contenting themselves with driving off crawling locusts and encourage them to kill them. 1 I. Issue a notice that claims for suspension of revenue will be very spar ingly granted as the people can save their crops if thev will take trouble, and that no claims will be considered unless the damage is reported at the very time that it is committed. 12. Get a special grant the moment that you know that locusts have laid eggs in the district, and immediately get screens and oil cloth. Remember that locusts on uncultivated land are easily killed, but that it is a most difficult thing to successfully attack them if they once get into crops. 13. As the zeminoars will certainly concentrate their energies on under fixed assessment, keep a specially sharp eye on crops under u batai.” Conclusions. crops 17. My experience is that unless American oil cloth is used, the crawling locusts will prove invincible, but if oil cloth is used the crawling locusts will be beaten at most, if not at all, points. Whenever possible put your greens and trenches in such a position that you will have to guide the locusts rather than to drive them. If quietly and slowly edged off in the direction required they will go quite willing ly, if they are frightened too much, or hurried, they are apt to scatter in all direc tions. Provided he has not the use of his wings, the larger the locust the easier he is to drive, and consequently to kill. 1 his is one of the chief reasons for p eventing eggs from being laid near the crops. 18. As noted in paragraph 2 above, the result of the Quetta-Peshin operations of 1901 has been to sa^e Government a large sum of revenue and to save the landowners from the loss of many thousands of rupees. It may also be said that the operations tended to reduce the danger of a serious epidemic in Quetta, for oil cloth was used to protect the reservoir where drinking water is stored. A much more important result than this was however attained and that was to prove conclusively to the people of the country that locust visitations can be met with success; and that whatever loss they incur from them is due to their own apathy and laziness The success of the Quetta- Keshia District operations has had a most satisfactory effect on the zemindars which will be fully demonstrated when locusts again attack the country. '1 he peo le are emboldened with success, and will require but little encouragement and guidance to themselves to initiate and carry out •■‘hiture operations. J.

I both sent the Sha ikh a copy of your note to me, and mentioned Uie matter privately to him. A translation of his reply to me is sent you herewith. 2. Verbally His Excellency asked me to say that he or his Secretary I cannot quite remember which had recently referred a petty case between a local woman and her husband who was in Zubair, to the Mudir there. He presuced this was what the Mutassarif had got hold of. He could not recollect he said any case of any importance being dealt# with like this. 3. Actually it had for long been customary here for his Secretary to communicate border oases of a trivial nature to Iraq frontier Officer^ both to get quick decisions and because it would be rather ridiculous for him to take them up to the Mutassarif by the usual official channels which meant his writing to me, and my passing on his lettet throu^i the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, His Excellency the Hi^i Commissioner for Ira^, the Minister of Interior, and finals down to him, the Mutassarif of Basrah. 4. It was in Glubb’s time that the arrangement really came into being, as Glubb protested that we were sending him cases of a very pet y and uninteresting nature in long round-about manner, which reached him after perhaps months of delay, and which really could have easily and quickly have been dealt with on the spot by one at his frontier chaoushes.

He offered as present s two she-camels to ourselves, and two to our son Subah an-Nasir, and we accepted his present and gave him a hand some gift in return.

My dear Dickson, Our people are quite agreeable to presenting H.E.The Sheikh with a small token of their regard in recognition of his assist ance in connection with the recent work which we have carried out in his territory. I have been given to understand that H.E.The Sheikh would very much like to obtain a Search-light for his yacht, and if this is still the case we would like to ask him to accept one which we would order from Home. Certain particulars are however necessary, and before placing the order I should require information in regard to the following:- (i) Is the search-light to be placed in the bows and manipulated by hand? (ii) Will the necessary current be generated by a dynamo coupled to the 75 H.P.Thomeycroft engine by means of a belt? (iii) if so how many revolutions per minute does the engine do? If you think it necessary, I could send an Engineer down to Kuwait to have a look at the Launch and Engine, so that there might be no mistake when placing our order. Yours sincerely. Lieut-Col.
