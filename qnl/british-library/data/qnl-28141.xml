Ext. 217A5 Whitehall, S.W. 1. / Y^J anuary, 1945. Dear Madam, In reply to your letter of 9th January, I write to say that we had already heard from Sir Geoffrey Prior on the subject of a passage for yourself and your children. Sir Geoffrey stated that he understood from your husband that application had been made by the Iraqi Government through the Iraqi Legation in London and the Crown Agents for the Colonies but on enquiry through the Foreign Office we have been informed that neither the Iraqi Legation nor the Crown Agents have, so far as it can be ascertained, received such an application. We would therefore suggest that you should inform your husband accordingly in order that he may approach the Iraqi Government again. Alternatively you might make enquiries yourself from the Iraqi Legation, whose address is 22, Queen's Gate, London, S.W.7. The Department of His Majesty's Government primarily concerned is the Foreign Office, to whom a copy of this letter and yours under reply is being sent. Yours faithfully, l • Mrs. J. N. Gordon, 24, Grampian Place, Aberdeen.■ Dear Harrison, With reference to your letters of the 31st October and the 1st December to Dundas, regarding the journey to Basra of Mrs. Goroon and her children, I write to confirm the telephone message that we have not received an application for a passage on Mrs. Gordon’s behalf. So far as we have been able to ascertain, neither the Iraqi Legation nor the Crown Agents for the Colonies have been requested to arrange facilities. F. Harrison, Esq. , India Office.0 ■ 6v /4./v» Sxt. 4325/1*4 3liJr Get Nuvuiber, 1944 * Pa i)«ar iJundas, I enclose herev/ith a ooyy of a personal letter froa the Political Resident asking whether we can assist in obtaining passages to Basrah for the wife and children of Capt. J .1!. Gordon of the Hearchos, who is, I assume, an eJi^lcye of the Iraqi Government. For the reasons indicated ty the Political Resident we should be glad to do southing possible to assist in obtaining passages for Capt. Gordon's faiaiiy, though I am afraid we have no particular locus standi in the matter. Can you advise us what the position is and what the prospects are of passages being obtainable. Yours sincerely.

Gordon the Commander of NEARCHUS asked me when I was coming over to Bahrain whether I could help him in getting permission for his wife and two children (4, 3,) to join him in Basrah. The Iraq Government have apparently agreed and have asked the Iraqi Legation in London and the Crown agents for the Colonies to facilitate it. As he has been much more helpful than his predecessor and as he is also Inspector of Gulf Lights, for which the Government of India are responsible, I think it would not be unreasonable for us to do what vie can and I would be grateful for any thing you can do to assist with the Passages Priority Board. He has only been three months at home in the last six years, I understand his home address is 24 Granpian Place, Torry (?), Aberdeen, Scotland. R. T.
