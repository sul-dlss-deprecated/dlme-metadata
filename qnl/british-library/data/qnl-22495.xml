Dear Sir, —^ $ It may become necessary, in the near future, to greatly Increase the surface equipment and works of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited and for that purpose it is requisite that the Company should control the surface rights of such area or areas as will en sure access to the sea and its navigable waters and provide space for the erection of additional equipment. I,therefore, on behalf of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited wish to inform you that I now propose to apply for permission to select an area or areas of the uncultivated lands belonging to The Bahrein Government. The places from which the selections are to be made are situated within the areas described below and delineated on the Map in Blue where the area is dry land, and in Red where the area is subject to tidal influence. The selection of the area or areas will require to be made with great care, because of the large amount of private property located within the boundaries of the marked areas. 2. s . © V Because the work of selecting the Company's full!require aents may be prolonged, the Company shall require at least a period )f two years to survey and map the areas required. &gt;f uncultivated land will be returned to The Bahrein Government, (1) The promentory known as Ummul-Hassam, bounded on the North by the Aerodrome, on the West by the gardens of Mahuz village, on the South by the seashore and on the East by the gardens of Charaifa and Jafair villages, (2) The foreshore adjacent to the abive (lfo,l) and extending to low water mark, and where necessary to deep navigable waters, (3) The foreshore adjoining the villages of Soihla, Belad al Zodim, Zinj and Mahuz, between Radmal Kiavari and foreshore No,2, and extending to low water mark, (4) The Eastern seashore of Manamah Island, bounded on the North by Radmal Kiavari Channel, on the East by the seashore, on the South by a line drawn a quarter of a mile North of Jau from the seashore due West 1^- miles in width and on the West by the line drawn from Radmal Kavari to the North Western corner of Jabal Hisai and from thence to the Western end of Southern boundary, (5) The Island of Sitra, (6) The foreshore from Tubli, around the Island of Sitra, up tp Jau, a mile in breadth or where necessary to deep navigable waters, v The attached map shows clearly the locations from which the selections are to be made.

Dear Sir, I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st Larch 193E and to say that the matter will be put up to the political Agent on his return from India, lours faithfully. Indian ssistant, In the absence of the Political Agent, Bahrain.© .If- The Bahrein petroleum company limited Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf , 22nd, April 1932. To. His B. Maj's Political Agent, 'R A H R B I Dear Sir, . The Bahrein Oil Concession (Dec,2-1925) I wish on behalf of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited to request an interpretation of the purport of Clause IX, Schedule 2, of The Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement. Until the exact meaning of this Clause is clarified, the difficulty is present of deciding how the value of a well as an oil producer is to be guaged. It can not mean that if a well yielded 3i tons of oil TDer day over a period of 30 days, in total over 100 tons, that The Company would be constrained to apply for a Mining Lease, covering territory that would be useless for the purpose of oil production ? Such an yield would not make a well commercially exploitable in fact it would prove it to be decidedly otherwise. My Company feel that this is not the intent or aim of Clause IX and is of the opinion that the meaning of the Clause would be much clarified and still retain the real intent of the Clause, if it were framed in different words to Miat it is at present. The Company considers that the aim of the Clause would be fully preserved and The Company is persuaded that full justice would be done to the object of the Clause, if the Clause were reframed in the following words:- - 2 - P.T.O.© Bahrein. 22-4-1932. - 2 - ' Clause IX . The right to win up to 100 (One hundred) tons of oil free of payment, and further quantities of oil on payment of the royalty per ton provided ■ in the Mining Lease. The privileges in this Clause may only 'be enjoyed 'by The Company during the perioS. for which the Prospecting Licence or its extensions are granted or until The Company declare that oil has been discovered in commercially exploitable quanti ties, whichever is the shorter. ' The above wording conveys clearly the interpre tation that The Company places upon the actual purpose of Clause IX. I may point out that the prospecting stage of the development of virgin oil territory is of the greatest import ance and anything that hinders The Company from acquiring the fullest information as regards the oil formation may be the cause of slowing up the advent of the actual production stage. It is important, so as not to retard the progress of The Company's programme of prospecting and development work, that the interpretation of Clause IX, be made without undue delay. May I therefore respectfully ask your early consideration of this request. I am, Sir. Your Obedient Servant. Chief Representative: The Bahrein Petroleum Co.Ltd.,&amp; Ko:C/47. io3.i ti or.!

On behalf of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, I request you to ask The Bahrein Government to change the reading of Clause 9, Schedule 2, so that the Clause will then read as follows;- [X. The right to win up to 100 (One tons of oil free of payment, and further quantities of oil on payment of the royalty per ton provided in the Mining Lease. The privileges in this Clause may only be enjoyed by The Company during the period for which the Prospecting Licence or its exten sions are granted or until The Company declare that oil has been discovered in Commercially exploitable quantities, whichever is the shorter.' Wording of Clause 9, at present is as follows ' Clause IX . The right to win up to 100 (One hundred) tons of oil free of payment and further quantities of oil on payment of the royalty per ton provided in the Mining Lease, but on condi tion that the Company shall apply for a Mining Lease in respect of each area in which work is proceeding as soon as more than 100 tons of oil are won from one single bore hole within it.

We have received copies of these two letters and after considering the matter we inform you of our opinion. With regard to the extension of the prospecting license for two years after the completion of the present time, which is in about seven months, we wish to see some result from the work of the oil company because they have now held the concession for many years. We think therefore that an extension of two years is very long but we are willing to grant an extension of one year. With regard to altering clause 9 of the prospecting license according to the letter of Major Holmes. As this alteration is not injurious to us, we are willing to allow this alteration, accordingly the Company will be able to obtain any amount more than 100 tons of oil but must pay the royalty on every ton after the first 100 tons.

Sir, ' v I hav 0 the hen our to forward for your information / a copy of a letter without number dated the 22nd April 1932 from the Chief Local Hepresentative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and my reply thereto. Upon my giving an interpretation of the clause,which I feel siare you will agree is the correct one,i:ajor Holmes immediately forwarded his letter dated the 24th April requesting the Bahrain Governmoit to change the readin of Giiuse 9,oohedule 2. rbe matter was discussed with ids excellency shaikh i'amadjand considerable difficulty was experienced in explaining the matter to him, 2. His Excellency was plainly bored by the details and observed that ! By God,the important thing was that some benefit should be found 5 . lie asked me what my advice was. I told him that if he adhered to the present wording the company could defeat his hopes of increased revenue by closing down each well as it approached the 100 ton limit, and that there was nothing to stop them doing this. I also pointed out that until oil was found Un comraercial quantities',the royalty would not rise above the Hs.10,000 rate now fixed and that it was not until 5 years had elapsed that the Government could force them to declare tuat oil had been so found or terminate the concession. \ tI(g) 3, His Excellency discussed the matter further with the Adviser and myself and finally gave the reply of which I enclose a copy# I had pointed out to him that the alter ation would require the concurrence of the Oolonial Office and I had suggested that since they had drafted this clause it would be advantageous to take their advice upon the matter# His Excellency agreed with me,and,as will be seem from his letter,specially asks for guidance in so technical a matter. 4. My personal opinion is that which I gave the Shaikh# The meaning of the clause is evidently to force the Company to take out a mining license at the earliest possible opportunity# This they have no intention of doing and to prevent this they will close down each well as it approaches hue 100 ion limit# rhe .itate has no recourse till 5 years have elapsed,and has no immediate financial gain,whereas by accepting the alteration they will gain something,though they mil have no means of checking their dues; nevertheless the Oolonial Office must have inserted this clause with some special meaning and the problem,which is strange to us,v/ill no doubt be familiar to them# I regret I can offer no useful opinion on the arguments advanced by Major Hoimes in his letters of the 22nd and 34th April for these are , technical matt^^ 0 4 ^ T 1 no experience. I have the honour to be Sir, lour Host Obedient Servant, Political Agent Bahrain.■•.-n - iw (B) I have reason to suppose that unless some modification of the 100 tons clause is made the Company propose, if possible, to win slightly less than 100 tons from the present bore hole after which they will close it down and sink another well and then close that down and sink another, and so on, until the period of the Prospecting Licence, and its possible extension, have come to an end* This, in ray opinion, is to the financial disadvantage of this Sovernment as it will postpone any payments from the Company to the Sovernment for a considerable time. The Company at present wish to avoid being compelled to take up the Mining Lease before they have finished prospecting, by sinking more wells in the neighbourhood of the present one,or before oil has been found in commercially exploitable quantities. The only way in which the Company can avoid being compelled to enter into the Mining lease under clause 9 of Schedule 2 is by closing each well after recovering slightly less than 100 tons. &amp; The Local Chief Representative of the Company assures me that rji® 8 v®. la3 ^ 1 course that the Company wishes to undertake.,he L? ? eS following words were deleted the Company 2 close the wells, the words are; but on condition that each v, appi ? f or a Minin g Lease in respect of eacn area in which work is proceeding as soon as more than 100 tons of oil are won from one bore hole within it.

During the 43 hours oil raised in the easing from a depth of 1080 feet to 745 feet which means that 8 terns of oil entered the hole in 2full days, or an averag© of 4 tons a day. There is not enough gas to flow the oil which means that production would only be obtained by pumping and the maximum amount obtainable per day would be about 4 tons. This is obviously practically nothing. So I am today recomending to my Principals that we continue drilling to see if there are more productive horizons below.

June 1932. sir, 1 With reference to your lett er,£lo. 93035/32 of June 11th, on the suoject of the Bahrain oil concession, I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to offer the following observations for the information of Secretary Sir Philip Gunliffe-Lister:, ■ (1) It will be recalled that under the terms of the \greensnt, a prospecting licence could be granted over 'areas to be selected by the Company with the approval of the Shaikh'» The Political Resident, in his despatch of J ily 22nd, 1931, said that the Shaikh had approved the grant of a licence and that he 'the Political Resident} had authorised the execution of an Agreement granting the licence,-!, copy of -rhich /ould be forwarded in due course. As no copy of this '.greeiaent -appe irs to have been received, the ■ Petroleum Department nre not aware of what area is covered 1 by the prospecting licence and would be glad if the Political I ? ; esid'int fcould be requested to furnish a copy without delai r • i (2) The terrris of the stern and General SyndicateVs conce~sioc of December 2nd,1^25, are in several respects j| unsatisfactory, and Clause IX of the second Schedule is an example of one of the unsatisfactory features. It is di'fficult at this sta^e to suggest a wholesale revision cf the Agreement, but it is considered that some improvement : could be effected and possibly one or two points covered, either during the revision of thia^Cla ae, or /hen the lease is f inally drawn up. i, (3) ... fnder Secretary of State, Colonial Office, Downing Street, i(3; The views expressed in the despatch of May 16th 2932, from the olitical Resident in the Persian Gulf, appear to be subject to modification in the light of hi a telegram oi June 4th, reporting that the Bahrain Petroieurc Company * - Uck oil ana that the well was making over 70 tons per a ay • a * this rate of output is conTiriaed, the Company v/iil probably shut in the well and proceed to drill further test v u.i.ls in order to prove the extent of the oil structure, with e. 'lew to selecting an area, for a, mining lease. 14) To enable the Pompuny to carry out further test drilling, some extension of the period of the Paoy t u.:tii.a Licence it- . av e, ,.ad tu.e Secretary f or t'ines aaaess tliat an exteiision of .one ys.j. .might be given, ahich could be reviewed later when it is seen vhat progress the Company. have been able to make. It should be recognised that the more prospecting drilling that is carried out, within the period allowed, the better, bat from the Shaikh's yoint of vieu, the most important consideration is how soon the Company can be induced to declare that 'oil has been discovered in commer cially exploitable quantities'. If the Company produce oil during tile period of their Prospecting Licence, this will ae to the advantage of the Shaikh in that it will enable him to counter anj suggestion from the Company that oil has not been found in 'commercially exploitable quantities'. (6) It is not unusual in prospecting licences to provide that a limited quantity of oil may be produced free * royalty for testing and experimental pnrposes. 'i'he provision contained in the latter part of Clause IX is, however, not satisfactory. It vjjight not be reasonable in all cases to sxyect a Company to apply for a mining lease ' 'acs soon as more than 100 tons of oil are won from one single borehole' or «.»-3- for it is possible that this oil might only be obt-une' I- baling ox yimping over a prolonged periou.. Tnder such conditions the well would be of little value exegpt as an indication of the occurrence of oil. Clause IX, as at present worded, states that the Company shall apply for a mining lease in respect of each area in which work i„ proceed ing as soon as more than 100 tons of oil are won from one •single borehole Uhin it. In the first place, it is not clear what is meant by the word 'area' in the above context, and secondly, th.a s if applied'literally, would have I the effect of limiting the n &gt;• ber of boreholes under prospect- lag licence to 3, since tinder the provisions of the Agreement the lease of 100,000 acres muet taken out in not more than c blocks. It would clearly not be to the advantage of the Shaikh to have the number of test boreholes thus limited. (7) The Secretary for Mines notes that the Agteement | oontaira; no provision, either in the prospecting licence or tne mining lease to compel the Company to furnish returns, 'or the purpose of royalty assessment, of the amount of oil produced, and it is suggested that in agreeing to an amendment cX' Clause IX the Shaikh should require the inclusion of such a provieion, and that facilities should be afforded either to the Shaikh or his representative to chech the returns. A suggested form of amendment to cover this point is enclosed herewith. It is presumably the absence of such a provision ich .the Political Agent at Bahrain had in mind in his des patch of May 3rd, 1932, when he stated that 'The State,.,, will have no means of checking their dues'. (-&gt; ' xe, of the above consideralions, the Secretary for Mines considers that the Company 's request for a modifica tion of Clause IX on the lines suggested is one which it may-4- be desirable to meet, and recommends that it should be r.jried to with the addition as to provision of returns --.d the right to check such returns referred to in the preceding paragraph, (9} Copies of this letter are be^ng sent to the Foreign Office, India Office, Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry, I an etc*, sd/- ¥, 0.

I am directed to invite your attention to Condition C sohedwled to the Assent given by tlie Shaikh of Bahrein to the assi.;nn-ent to the 1 ahrein Petrol em Coiapsny .Limited of the oil concession granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited on the 2nd of December 1925, Condition C of the schedule provides that the Bahrein Petroleum Company shall at all times maintain in Bahrein an official to he called the 'Chief Local Representative* of the Company,who shall he the sole representative ^f the Company empowered to deal direct with the local authorities and po'iulation, and stipulates that for the first five years eftr»r the Bahrein Petroleum Cnnpeny have started to operate In Bahrein, their Chief Local Representetive shall be or frank Holmes. She assignment of the concession to the Bahrein ietroleum Company MLLAMTrnM, ,Company was axecuted ©n the 1st of August 1930,and sine© then it has accordingly been incumbent upon that Company to maintain a Chief Local Representative at Bahrein, Ire® that date up to the present time Major Holmes is reported to have been in Bahrein for the following periods:- Arrived Bahrein 25th 1 ay 1931 ) 20 Left Bahrein for Ingland 13th June 1921) days.

It is moreover understood that he does not propose to return to Bahrein for three or four months. Thus, in a period of yefre K ajor Bolraee will have spent little wore than six months in all in Bahrein, In these eircumstancas, it can hardly be contended that the provieiona of Condition C are beiru fulfilled. If in realised that temporary absence for the purpose of relaxation, home leave and health, must be allowed but it is clearly desirable that the Company* a local representative should regain mora or less permanently in hrein. This point was brought to the notice of the fiastern and General Syndicate ^i«iited in paragraph 3 of this Uepertment 1 aDepertment*® letter Iso.79178/30 of the 15th of HoTeffiher, 1530,with a reqwest that Syndicate wo«14 agree that Major Holmes should reside at Bahrein for a minimum period of nine months in each year.

Mr. Ballantyne and iar♦ iiamilto® of the jaahram .petroleum Company called nvith reference to our two letters of the 8th August* With regard to the letter concerning the revision of Clause IX of the Concession Agreement t they wanted to knoK what had happened^ xtold them that the ne si dent had been informed that there waa no objection to the extension of their concession for one year, and, when they said that they did not think one year would be enough, pointed out that they were fully at liberty to apply for an additional extension, and suggested that they should do so stating the reasons fully, and that they should put up the application locally but send us a reasoned letter which we could consider here and send out to the nesident. i was careful to explain that x could not commit anybody as to whether the further extension would be granted, and in particular could not commit the ahaikh of uahram. Mr. Hamilton said that they had no objection what ever to the principle of the measurement of the oil, in fast they fully agreed that some ouch procedure was necessary, but they did not particularly like the form or words adopted. Me said that they were quite prepared to agree the that/oil should be measured in accordance with the general oilfield practice, and that the shaik^or his representative should have the right to check the measurements, but he foresaw that there might be some tech^cal difficulty in regard to the method to be adopted, in particular if somebody suggested the use of unreliable meters/meters or something of that £ind s which raigHt lead to considerable friition which he nas anxious to avoid, a suggested that they should fcut their views into writing and that we could then consider the whole business after referring to it to the jretroleum department g by whose advice we must of course be guided on such a technical matter. They saw this point of view and agreed to do so. ihey asked whether they were to understand that the addition of these provisions was to be a sort of quid pro qu o for the amendment of Clause aX # adding that they didn't really object to Clause iX as it stood though it was admittedly unsatisfactory# After looking at the x-etroleum Department letter of the 20th »iune, a said that our intention was to supply an admitted want in the concession which didn't contain any provision for measurement at all, and that we thought this would be a suitable opportunity. They agreed that this was only reasonable. The upshot then is that they will write giving ±h* their views as regards the draft clause and making such general comments as they think suitable, a Aave them to understand that other xiepartments wil^have to be consulted and that some d$lay is inevitable, and 'istoey in the end the thing will have to go to the shaikh* With regard to the other letter, they explained that it had cone upon them as rather a bolt from the blue. Our two previous letters had been sent, not to the uahrain Jfetroleum Comoany, but to the isastern and tieneral syndicate and the Syndicate had not passed them on to the Company, i gathered that the;/ were not wedded to major no lines but considered that he was persona grata with this office, and therefore they had not raised any question about his various/^ I n. n 1.1. various absencea from Bahrain or his appointing somebody else to act for him, thinking that this had all been arranged between Major holmes and the Colonial uffice vor so they said;, if Major nolmes is removed they asked who would be acceptable, to which a said that could not answer that question, that x thought it would be for them to put up names and, in any dase, the authorities in the Gulf would have to be consulted. i undertook to let x&amp;r. jjallantyne have copies of the previous letter about Major nolmes and have done so accordingly.

Downing St., 30th August 1932. Dear Mr.Ballantyne, With reference to your letter lo.3.1.1932, of the 18th of August, we are consulting the other Departments of State with regard to the r@Tision of Clause 9 of the second Schedule and the provisions required for measuring and checking the amount of oil. It seems to me that something will have to he added to the second Schedule anyhow. Under Clause 9 as it stands you are hound to apply for a mining lease in respect of each area (what the 'area 11 means is nowhere stated) as soon as 100 tons of oil has heen got out of a single hore hole. If the area is over the whole territory of Bahrein then your operations would he seriously handicapped hy strict insistence on the Clause as it stands. The provisions for measurement might very well, as you suggest, he put into the mining lease, but it would surely be 'best to amend Clause 9 so as to make it run something like 'the right to win up to 100 tons of oil free of payment, and further quantities of oil on payment of the royalty per ton provided for in Article 8 of the mining lease and calculated in the manner laid down in that Article*'. Tou will be hearing from us officially on the subject, but I think it best to send you this semi official acknowledgment of your letter.

The Company has then to delineate the area of lOOpOO acres over which the Mining Lease v/ill be granted. A Map clearly marking the areas comprised within the 100000 acres must be attached to the Company's application for the Mining Lease.

Under the present form of Clause IX the Shaikh had the right to require the Company to apply for ft Mining respect of an area as soon as 100 tons of oil hsd been won from one bore hole. While it is now sgreed that this provision is/ er Secretary of State, Gonial Office, Downing Street, S.f.lis not entirely satisfactory and an amendmant of the Article is desirable, the position under the revised Article will be that the Company might have an. appreciable production of oil without having at once to take out a Oning Lease. On this production they will pay royalty, but it is considered that it should be made clear that the payments in respect of royalty will be in addition to the annual payment of Ks« 10,000 provided for in Article of the main Agreeaent* The position would be met if at the beginning of the last fentence of that Article the following worde were inserted;- 'Except for payment in respect of royalty which shall boccKte payable under Article IX of Che Second Schedule to this Agreer&gt;!ent in respect of oil won in excess of 100 tons#' 1 A consequential siaendaent of the siining leas® in regard to thii point ought also to be carried out, becaat# until the Company make their declaration that oil is being produced in cofiiiiercisl quantities tne dOvui. rent payable under the mining lease, is the that payable tmder the prospecting licence, and. unlets the ainin^^ leeee and prospecting, licence are brought into line the position of the Shaikh might be worse in this respect under the mining, lease, than under the prospecting licence. One# the Company have declared that oil has been found in coranercial quantities they undertake, under Article I of the le^' e » that the amount received by the Shaikh in respect of royalty shall not be less than E^3G,000 per aonwu Xt will also be necessary to provide in the mining lease a clause for the measurement of oil similar to that now suggested for the prospectiiv licence# Certain other alterations may be necessary when the mining/mining leas© is actually granted, and I an to suggest that it would perhaps be eufficient if the Company were informed at this stage that Bin Majesty's Groverment concur in the proposed amendments (subject to the alterations suggerted aoove), on the underatending that it would be necessary to raake certain consequential amendmente to the mining lease when this is granted to the Compariy, As regards the proposal that the prospecting licence should be erbemed for a further year, i.e. to the 2nd December, 1934, it will be recalled that by the letter of the 20th June last from this Department, the Secretary for Mines agreed that an extension of one year might be given which could be reviewed later when it was seen what progress the Coropany had been able to make, Thie would give the Company until December 2nd, 1933, for their proapecting operations, and the Secretary for Mine# ie reluctant to agree to any further extension at present until it is seen what progress the Company has been able to make. The Company do not appear to have furnished any detailed report on their operations or indicated what future drilling programe they have in mind. The Secretary for ines consider®, therefore, that in view of the length of time which he a already elapsed since the Agreement was entered into, It would be preferable to inform the Company that any question of the further extension of the period of their prospecting licence must be reviewed a ain later in, ^ay, April, 1933, ami that then detailed information of the progress they h ve made, and of their ircriedi.rte drilling prograame should be supplied with any further application they may make..

His Majesty's Government will, however, be willing to reconsider the question at a later time, say in April 1933, should the Company still desire a further extension of their prospecting licences, but, in that case, detailed information of the progress made and of the Company's immediate drilling programme should accompany any any application of this nature that may be made.

Dear Sir, I wonder if you woixld kindly ask the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian fhilf a question in connection with cur Bahrein work? It is this: The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited apnlied for an extension of the Prospecting License (being Schedule II of the Concession Agreement) The Politi cal Agent Bahrein informed rae that a question had been raised - I think from Inai#~- that a map should be attached showing the area the Company desire#, xo prospect under the extension. It is only under Schedule III that a map is necessary or called for. Schedule III being the - Mining Lease section of the Agreement which is not reached until the area to be chosen - 100,000. acres - is delendated . The Company is still operating under Schedule II that is the Prospecting License, The Political Agent Bahrein was recently in communication with the Political Resident with a view of clearing up the map question - the only map we could give is one coverin? the whole of the Bahrein'Islands - I would be much obliged if you would ask the Political Resident if the matter has been cleared up. n he Prospecting license under which the Company is at present working ~ expires on December 2nd, 1952.190 Kuwait. 25-11-1932. The Oompany is most anxious about the position and and if the Political Resident could tell me how the question stands / if cleared/up I could go to-morroi7 to Bahrein and procure the Shaikh of Bahrein's signature to the extension. The extension has already heen passed by the Political Resident. I cim sorry to trouble you at this busy moment. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant. Prank Holmes. Chief Local Representative; The Bahrein Petroleum Co. Ltd;OiP Note. ( ^ 1 ^ Major Holmes came to see me at midday on tHe 30th November 1932 to enquire about the extensio r 'of the Prospecting License. He seemed satisfied with the letter of the Political Agenu inforra±ng him that the extension had been accepted in principle and that the maps question would be elucidated later. I told him that I had glanced at the file but had not had time oo read it properly and he gave me a rough outline of what had happened. As regards the maps he seemed to think that the clause about 'select areas' had been taken from the form of license used in connection with the Iraq Prospecting licenses. 2. Major Holmes said that he was going to Kuwait by air on the 1st December 1932 and returning on the 7th December 1932, He said that he hoped to see the Resident and I consequently mentioned that the Resident was coming here on the 5th December 1932. 3. He tells me that they have reached 1700 feet and that a sample of their oil gives, the figure 34 as compared with the A.P.O.C 29,but he tha^ that,ofcourse,their figure was merely a top pressing and not an average. 4.

The letter had reference to his oil activities in Bahrain, to which of course the Persian Government lay claim. He had not got the letter with him - though it might be in his files at Kuwait, or elsewhere, and had received it as long ago as about last February.

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL,S.W.I. 15th December 1932. (j My dear Flood, I write on a small point arising out of Colonial Off ice letter of 12th December, No,98035/32, to the Petroleum Department about the Bahrain oil concession. We see from the correspondence that the Comoany cont inue to press for the insertion in the second of the new articles proposed to be added to Schedules 2 and 3 of the Prospecting Agreement of their phrase 'Such accounts shall be treated as confidential by the Shaikh with the exception of such figures therein as he may be required by law to publish.' We should have preferred the wording suggested in the Colonial Office letter of 26th October,No,98035/32 to Ballantyne, but the point is not perhaps of vital importance and need not be pressed. At the same time, while the Shaikh in a matter like this would no doubt act under advice, he is in fact an independent ruler, and might at a pinch pass an Order under which he would be required to publish the figures in full, so that it is doubtful to what extent the Company are really effectively safeguarding themselves by insisting on the wording in questi on. This being the case, while difficulty need not perhaps be anticipated, it might be as well, if it is agreed to accept the Company's wording, to make the position clear in formally to Ballantyne, so that in the (we hope most improbable] event of a hitch at any later stage, the Americans will not be able to suggest that we have been disingenuous in our dealings with them, i am sending copies of this letter to Starling, Warner, and Moore of the Admiralty.

I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Liater to refer to the letter from this Department of the 28th October enclosing a copy of a letter to the Bahrain Petroleum Company regarding the Company's application for the revision of Article IX of the Second Schedule to their Concession Agreement, and to transmit to you, to be laid before the unable to accept the proposal in the third paragraph of Mr. Ballantyne's letter, it is now proposed to instruct the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to arrange for a supplementary agreement on the agreed lines, to be concluded between the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 3. It will be seen from paragraphs 6 and 7 of their letter that the Company are reluctant to adopt the suggestion that any consequential amendments to the Mining Lease can more convenient- j ly be considered when the Mining Lease is being granted to the Company, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister is disposed to regard the Company^ attitude on this point as not unreasonable, and he would be glad to be furnished with the observations thereon 3rd December 1932 93035/11/32 Sir Secretary for Mines, a copy of the reply which has been received from the Company. 2.

J•E#W#Flood# IfTHE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED. 19» Mo orgate, E • C • S • 25th November 1932. Sir, I would refer further to your letter of the 26th October 1932 (Reference 98035/32). In regard to paragraph 2 of such letter, this Company cannot concede to the Shaikh of Bahrain the right to publish particulars of the total annual output of crude oil and natural gas. In the view of this Company, it is felt that such a provi si on might, in certain circumstances, embarrass it very seriously in its trading operations, as giving to competitors information which would be harmful to the trading interests of this Company, This Company raises no objection to the Shaikh of Bahrain publishing such figures as he may be required by law to publish from time to time. It was to this end that I was instructed to add to the so-called Measurement Clause, the wordss- 'Such accounts shall be treated as confidential by the Shaikh, with the exception of such figures therein as he may be required by law to publish'. In view of the foregoing explanation, it is hoped that the asked for addition at the end of the provisions for the measuring and checking of oil, will be withdrawn. Concerning Clause 4 of your letter under reply, the Company agrees the proposed addition, reading:- 'Except for payments in respect of royalty which shall become payable under Article IX of the Second Schedule to this Agreement in respect of oil won in excess of 100 tons. to Article VI of the main agreement. As to Clause 5 of the said letter, it is appreciated that the agreed provisions for measuring and checking of oil mmst be inserted also in the Third Schedule,i e.in the form of Mining Lease to be granted when the time comes for that. This Company, however, views with alarm the suggestion contained ....-2- contained in such, letter that the exact terms of certain consequential amendments to the Mining Lease, which will prooablj be entailed by the adoption of the said provisions for measuring and checking of oil, be considered when the Mining Lease is being granted to the Company. This Company feels that although such is not the contention of His Majesty's Government, this would, in fact, leave the form of the Mining Lease open to discussion at the time the Company proposed to take it up. This, whether it be in the favour of the Company or not, certainly involves present uncertainty as to the exact form of the Mining Lease. From a practical working point of view, such uncertainty cannot be allowed to prevail. In the view of this Company, there are no consequential alterations and you are asked to have the draft examined in order that there may be no question outstanding on this point. This Company suggests that the modifying Agreement be now put into draft, settled by Mr. J.H.Stamp, and then sent to your ^6egal Department, to the end that when such Department has had an opportunity of considering it, we should meet and conclude it so far as His Majesty's Government is concerned.

Hamilton and myself on Friday last the 12th instant. I am directed by this Company to inform you it is pleased to note there is no objection on the part of His Majesty's Government to the revisions desired by this Company for the reaioval of the existing ambiguity in the said Clause IX and to state that, in principle, the addition of adequate provisions for the measuring and checking of the amount of oil produced for the purpose of royalty assessment is acceptable to this Company. The re are, however, certain modifications which it is desired, for the reasons given to you at our said interview, to effect in the draft of the provisions accompanying your letter under reply and I now forward a copy of your draft shewing such modifications in red ink. I have also to suggest that these new provisions concerning the measuring and checking of oil produced for the purpose of royalty assessment should be addedadded to Clause VIII of the Ihlrrt , , inird Schedule to this Company»s Gonoossion Agreement + u .. greemeat rather than to Clause II of the Second Schedule. It ia thousllt that by .eane the pOaalhllUy o f a.Mgulty which ffilg ht otherwise arise will be avoided. Thia _ ., s should not occasion any difficulty in connection with the ascertainment of what, if any, royalty is payable to the Sheikh of Bahrein under the provisions of the revised Clause IX of the Second Schedule, fhis Company will now be pleased to hear that the additional provisions for measuring and checking oil produced for the purpose of royalty assessment, as modified by this Company, and the foregoing suggestion as to their being added to Clause VIII of the Third Schedule, are approved and that the matter will now be placed on an ofxicial looting and that the British Authorities in the Persian Gulf will be requested, without delay, to advise the Sheilch of Bahrein to conclude the necessary Supplemental Agreement with the Company. Upon hearing from you that this is so, I will have the draft of such Supplemental Agreement put in hand immediately and forwarded for approval to you, or as you may direct. Inasmuch as you have assured us that the pro iosed revision of Clause IX of the Second Schedule has been approved and is not conditional upon the acceptance by this Company of the proposed provisions for measuring end checking oil and seeing that the Company are in agreement, in principle, with the necessity for making provision for the measuring and checking of oil produced for the purpose of royalty assessment and seeing also that some time must necessarily elapse before the Supplemental( n 9 \%io Supplemental Agreement giving effect to all necessary modifioations to the Concession Agreement is formally completed, tnis Company rests assured that His Majesty's Government will now inform the Sheikh of Bahrein of its approval, ii it has not already done so. x em i &amp;c mf (Signed) H.

Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe- Lieter to refer to the letter from, this office of the 30th of August on the subject of the Bahrein Oil Concession at Bahrein, and to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary for Mines, the enclosed copy of an official letter from the Company together with a copy of the semi official note to which it refers. E. So far as this Department is concerned, the alteration suggested by the Company, which takes the form of inserting the actual amount of royalty payable instead of a reference to Clause 8 of the Mining Lease, appears to be unobjectionable, but I am to request that the views of the Secretary for Mines may be obtained upon the subj ect. 3.

It seems to me that something will have to be added to the Second Schedule anyhow. Under Clause 9 as it stands you are bound to apply for a mining lease in respect of each area (what the '• area' 1 means is nowhere stated) as soon as 100 tons of oil has been got out of a single bore hole. If the area is over the whole territory of Bahrein then your operations would be seriously handicapped by strict insistence on the Clause as it stands. The provisions for measurement might very well, as you suggest, be put into the mining lease, but it would surely be best to amend Clause 9 'bo as to make it run something like 'the right to win up to 100 tons of oil free of payment, ••~nd further quantities of oil on payment of the royalty per ton provided for in Article 8 of the mining lease and calculated in the manner laid down in that Article.' You will be hearing from us officially on the subject, but I think it best to sand you this semi-official acknowledgment of your letter.

I have to acknowledge receipt of Mr. J.1»W. Flood's letter 98036/32 addressed to me under date the 30th August, 1932« This Company is quite ready to acoede to Mr. Flood's suggestion of a further modification of Clause 9 of the Second Schedule. It thinks, however, that the Clause would be clearer if it read thus:- ^The right to win up to 100 tons of oil free of payment and further quantities of oil on payment of a royalty of Ra. 3, 8. 0 per ton of net crude oil got and saved (i.e. after deducting water and foreign substances and oil required for the customary operations of the Company's installations in the Sheikh's Territories]. n Then would follow as a sub-clause a copy of the new Measurement Clause for the Mining lease. I assume you would desire to retain the paragraph readings- 'The privileges in this Clause may only be enjoyed the Company during the period for which the Prospecting license or its extensions are granted or until the Company declare that oil has been discovered in commercially exploitable quantities, whichever is the shorter.' ? ! j i•v If so, this would com© on as ^ 18 a 8eoon( i sub-clause. This paragraph does not seem to me to ha™ n™ nave now any particular waning or significance, ana I Eugsest lt mlght be I should be glad to bear tllat the foragolng suggestions are acceptable to H.M.Government.

Flood's letters, Ho, 98036/32, of 30th r , i\ .uitust, 27th September, and 6th October, enclosing copies oi. letters ±rom the Bahrein Petroleum Company in regard to the terms of their concession in Bahrein, and to request you to convey to Secretary Sir Philip Gun liffe-Lister the following observations thereon. I V s , r v v The Secretary for Mines has no objection to the h ' x ^ amenaments proposed by the Company to the suggested! provisions for measuring crude oil won, with the exception that in consequence of revisions suggested by the Company, \ Y.v ■ he considers that the following words should be added at \ the end of the revised clause « 'In any event the Shaikh shall have the right to publish particulars of the total annual output of crude oil find natural gas'. Consideration has been given to the further suggestions made in the letter from the Bahrein Petroleum Company of 6th September, 1932, as to the amendment of Clause IX of the second Schedule to the Concession and subject to the following condition, I am to say that the Secretary for Mines is prepared to concur in the suggestions, including the deletion of the paragraph which reads 'The privileges etc shorter'. Under the present form of Clause IX the Shaikh had the right to require 'owa? 0 nsi? ry of state ' a s street, S .W.I.I •. . * ■ -tii _ ^ ^ ^ of an area as soon as 100 tons or n n u . 01 01 1 iiad been won from one bore hole. VYhlle it l s now agree4 that provision is not entirely aati.factory and on amendment Of 'tillS 'ti jLO 1 €1 i.S Cl ^ i T*l-iH I 1* • a weairable, the position under the revised Article will be that the Company might &gt;ave an appreciable production of oil without having at Once to take out a Mining Lease. On this production they,will pay royalty, but it is considered that it should be'made clear that the payments in respect of royalty will be in addition to the annual payment of Hs.10,000 provided for in article VI of the main Agreement. The position would De met if at the beginning of the last sentence of that Article the following words were inserted • v- 'Except for payments in respect of royalty which shall become payable under Article IX of the Second Schedule to this Agreement in respect of oil won in excess of 100 tons.' a consequential amendment of the mining lease in regard to this point ought also to be carried out, because until the Company make their declaration that oil is being produced in commercial quantities the dead rent payable under the mining lease , is the same as that payable under the prospecting licence, and unless the mining lease and prospecting licence are brought into line the position of the Shaikh might be worse in this respect under the mining lease, than under the prospecting licence. Once the Company have declared that oil has been found in commercial quantities they undertake, under Article IX of the lease, that the amount received by the Shaikh in respect of royalty shall not be less than Hs.30,000 per annum. It ?#ill also be necessary to provideprOTlde in the mlnin s io aa e a olauee for the moasuroment of oil similar to that now suggested for the proopeotlng licence. certain other ilterations irisiy be necessary when the mining lease is actually granted, and I am to suggest that it .iQul^ perhaps be sufTicieat if the Company were informed at this stage that His Majesty's aovernment concur in the proposed amendments (subject to the alterations suggested above), on the understanding that it would be necessary to make certain consequential amendm^-nts to the mining lease when this is granted to the Comp any. As regards the proposal that the prospecting licence should be extended for a further year, i.e. to the 2nd beeember, 1934, it will be recalled that by the letter of the 20th June last from this Department, the Secretary for lines agreed that an extension of one year might be given which could be reviewed later when it was seen whut progress the Company had been able to make, This would give the Company until December 2nd, 1933, for their prospecting operations, and the Secretary for Wines is reluctant to agree to any further extension at present until it is seen what progress the Company has been able to make. The Company do not appear to have furnished any detailed report on their operations or indicated what future drilling programme they have in mind. The Secretary for Mines considers, therefore, that in view of the length of time which has already elapsed since the Agreement was entered into, it would be preferable to inform the Company that any question of the further extension&amp; extenalon of the period of their proepectlng lioenoe must be reviewed again later in, 8ay&gt; Aprilj 1933&gt; ^ ^ then detailed information of the progress they have made, and of their immediate drilling programme should be supplied with any further application they may make.

His Majfsty»s Government are prepared to accept the revised draft provisions which accompanied your letter of the 18th August, subject to the addition at the end of the following words 'In any event the Sheilch shall hate the right to publish particulars of the total annual output of crude oil and natural gas'. 3« Subject to the observations contained in paragraph 4 below. His Majesty's Government are also prepared to concur in the further amendments to Clause IX of the Second Schedule suggested in the Company's letter of the 5th September, including the deletion of the paragraph beginning 'The provisions in this Clause etc • • * N 4 # It is possible that under Article IX, revised as tot&amp;mTxm, esq.aa at present contemplated, the Company might be in a position to produce an appreciable quantity of oil without taking out a Mining iease.

In any case it will be necessary to provide in the Mining Lease a clause for the checlcing and measurement of oil similar to that now to be included in the Prospecting Licence. 6. On hearing that your Company is prepared to agree to the further amendments suggested in this latter, the necessary steps will be taken to inform the Sheikh of Banrain of the views of His Majesty's Government in the matter.

In regard to paragraph 2 of such letter, this Company cannot concede to the Sheikh of Bahrein the right to publish particulars of the total annual output of crude oil and natural gas. In the view of this Company, it is felt that such a provision might, in certain circumstances, embarrass it Teryssriously in its trading operations, as giving to competitors information which would be harmful to the trading interests of this Company. This Company raises no objection to the Sheikh of Bahrein publishing such figures as he may be required by law to publish from time to time. It was to this end that I was instructed to add to the so-called Heasurement Clause, the words M 3uch accounts shall be treated as confidential by the Shaikh, with the exception of such figures therein as he may be required by law to publish*. In view of the foregoing explanation, it is hoped that the asked for addition at the end of the provisions for the measuring and checking of oil, will be withdrawn. Concerning Clause 4 of your letter underreply, the Company agrees the proposed addition, reading 'iSxcept&gt;0 \ Payments in respect of royalty 5 ^ - VBytibleunder Article IX of the Second Schedule to this Agreement in resnect of oil won in excess of 100 tons to article VI of the Main Agreement. As to Clause 5 of the said letter, it is appreciated that the agreed provisions for measuring and checMng of oil must he inserted also in the Third Schedule, i.e. in the form of Mining Lease to he granted when the time comes for that. This Company, howerer, Tiews with alarm the suggestion contained in such letter that the exact terms of certain consequential amendments to the Mining hew,which will probably he entailed hy the adoption of the said provisions for measuring and checking of oil, he considered when the Mining I«ease is being granted to the Company. This Company feels that although such is not the contention of His Majesty's Government, this would, in fact, leave the form of the Mining Iiease open to discussion at the time the Company proposed to take it up. This, whether it be in the favour of the Company or not, certainly involves present uncertainty as to the exact form of the Mining Lease. From a practical working point of view, such uncertainty cannot be allowed to prevail# In the view of this Company, there are no consequential alterations and you are asked to have the draft examined in order that there may be no question outstanding on this poiht. This Company suggests that the modifying Agreement be now put into draft,settled by Mr. J.H. 3tamp, and then sent to your legal Department, to the end that when such Department has had an opportunity of considering it, we should meet and conclude it so far as His Majesty's Government is concerned.

Stonerj* 'Advlae best price for F.O.B* Bahrein fuel oil for steam outfit and point of delivery.* to which 1 answered;- 'Facilities necessary and difficulties connected therewith make importation fuel oil out of question. Suggest using electricity until modification Clause IX allows use of Bahrein crude oil, or have L.H. Hamilton arrange with Colonial Office use of Bahrein crude oil pending alteration of Clause 12.' There Is one steam drilling outfit now en route, and possibly another will 1&gt;e shipped shortly, or is already en route. It will take about barrels of oil per 24 hours to furnish fuel for each boiler setting, and it is ohviouslytoo expensive a proposition to take delivery of fuel oil 2% or 3 miles off shore and then haul it to our locations in trucks. We had intended using our own crude oil for fuel 'but this will 'be impossible pending proper altera tion of Clause IX, or unless Hamilton can make some arrangement with the Colonial Office, which will allow the use of crude oil from our wells pending the clarification of Clause IX. In the meantime, I propose to use electricity, which will be much slower in moving from one location to another than would steam equipment. Also there will be no possibility of running two strings of tools, becausebecause our company would not bo willing to ohip in another expenairo Biesel electric outfit at thie time, Xou can plainly see from the above that the delay in making certain desired alterations in the Contract will slow up our work considerably # j suggest that you point out this fact to the Shaikh and the Political people in the Persian Gulf.

With regard to the draft Indenture enclosed with Mr, Ballantyne's letter of 2nd December, the Secretary for Minos sees no reason the Agreement t© amend the Prospecting Mcence should not now be completed, subject to the following modifications:* (a) The wording of Clause (2) requires amendment by addition of the words 'the Second Schedule to* after the word 'of' in line 2. The Article IX, referred to is in the Second Schedule (Prospecting licence) and not in the main Agreement, (b)It is suggested that the words 'and also in Schedule 3 thereof immediately after Article YIII.' in lines 3 - 5 of Clause (3) should be omitted for the reason indicated below, (o) The two new Articles might be numbered IXA, and IXB, Secretary of State, ® nia l Office, ^owning Street, S,W,1, WithWitb these alterations tlie Agreement would then deal only with alterations to the Prospecting Licence, and could 'be accepted without further delay. 3. As regards the Mining Iiease, while on the one hand the Petroleuia Department would not wish to press the point that any alterations in the present form should be leit to 'be settled when th# Comp any make their application for such a Lease, they would suggest on the other hand that His Majesty's Government should not accept the position that the form attached to the present Agreement is unalterable# If necessary, it can be pointed out to the Company that they have asked for farourable consideration to be given to them in connection with their numerous applications for extension of time and upon the matter of the alteration of the Prospecting Licence which is now under consideration, and the Secretary for Mines sees no reason why the Company should not be prepared to meet the views of the Colonial Office in its capacity of adviser to the 3hei)ch in regard to reasonable amendments in the form of Mining Lease appended to the original Agreement. As regards these amendments, it will be practicable for the Petroleum Department in the near future to indicate the alterations which it would consider desirable to have made. It is not thought that any of the alterations will he of a character which the Company is lively to find difficulty in accepting# 4. The following points already arise aa a result of alterations which have been made or are the subject of the proposals now under discussions* (a)(a) The clause as regards payment of royalty on amounts of crude oil won in excess of 100 tons wMch it is now proposed to insert in the Prospecting Licence should be carried through into Article III • of the Mining Lease, and these provisions made applicable until the Company has '1 declared that oil has been found in commercially exploitable quantities and the minimum royalty of 30,000 rupees per annum becomes operative, (b) The measuring clause will have to be inserted. The Company propose that this should be | done in the proposed supplementary Agreement now under consideration, but it is considered ii preferable to deal with this along with the other 1 alterations which are considered necessary in [: ■ the Mining Lease. I :i l2 He) The Agreement of June, 1930, as regards the modified form of British Control clause provides that these conditions are to be inserted in the Mining Lease, (d) The Air Ministry in their letter of the i L vt ' 13th May, 1929, have already asked that provision ar ' b should be made in the Mining Lease as regards keeping clear a landing ground for aeroplanes on the northern extremity of Bahrein Island, (e) There is also the question whether provision ought not to be made giving the Shei&amp;h the right of pre-emption during emergencies, and requiring that a proportion of the oil should be refined in Bahrein or British territory, 5, The other points which the Petroleum Department would wish to raise are rather less important in character. TheTlae discussion of 'those various points iQ&amp;y, however, take a certain amount of time, and the Secretary for Mines considers that the Company would 'be well advised to accept an Agreement modifying the Prospecting Iiicenoe now in order that their operations may l)e allowed to continue, it 'being understood that the alterations to the Mining Lease will be taken up with the Company at an early date, 6» Copies of this letter are being sent to the foreign Office, India Office and the Admiralty, (Sgd,,) f,C* Starling, Director,0%. u 98035/?t. 11/32. Downing Street, 39th Secaaber, 1932, Gentlemen, I am directed 'by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to refer to your letter of the 2nd December in which you enclosed printed copies of a draft of the modifying agreement suggested in regard to your prospecting licence, and to state that it is generally acceptable to His Majesty*a Goirermaent, subject to the minor alterations set out below# 2. It is considered adviaable that the new Supplementary Agreement should refer to the prospecting licence only, since it is probable that further alterations will be suggested in the mining lease, and it would therefore appear desirable that the reference to the third Schedule, which appears in paragraph 3, should be deleted. With regard to Article II, it should be noted that the Article IX to which reference is made is in the second Schedule to the Agreement and not in the main Agreement, and accordingly the words, 'the Second Schedule to' should be inserted after the word •of' in line 2 of that Clause. 3, If the Company agree to the amendment of the draft Supplementary Agreement as indicated above, namely, by insertion of the words 'the Second Schedule to' after the word 'of' in line 2 of Clause 2, and the omission of the words 'and also in Schedule 3 thereof immediately EETHOLIUK CQMPAIIY, LIMITED.immediately after Article YIII»» in lines 3 to 5 of Clause 3, there is no reason why the Company should not proceed forthwith to conclude the Agreement with the SheiJch, and the Resident in the Persian Gulf will 'be informed accordingly, 4, I am also to suggest that it would be convenient to mimber the two new Articles m and UB. 5, As regards the mining lease, if and when the time comes to complete it, it is probable that certain modifications may be considered advisable, 'but it is not thought that any of the alterations which His Majesty^ Government would wish to see embodied in the lease will be of a character which the Company is likely to find any difficulty in accepting, and for the present it seems clearly preferable to conclude the Supplementary Agreement with regard to the prospeoting licence forthwith in order that the Company 1 s operations may proceed without undue delay. The question of the alterations which will be suggested in the mining lease will he talc en up with you at an early date,» 6, On receipt of information that the modifications in the Supplementary Agreement set out above are accaptable to the Company, the necessary communication will he addressed to the Besident in the Persian Gulf.
