Following are the views of H.M.G. in light of discussion between Departments concerned: (a) as regards rifles, Sheikh may be informed * that H.M.G. in case of emergency will deal sympathetically with any request f: om Sheikh and will not tie him to his quota of 500. (b) they are opposed to granting Sheikh’s request In regard to machine guns and armoured cars, both because of possible provocative effect on Ibn. Saud and because of uncertainty as to capacity of Sheikhdom to produce people competent to use them or even prevent their falling into wrong hands. In principle, too, they are averse from allowing machine guns and even armed cars to pass into the hands of Arab rulers unless this is quite essential and could not agree to provision of tanks or of 'armoured cars' strictly so called. You should in these circumstances reply on this point that H.M.G. have no reason to anticipate a situation in which possession of either machine guns or armoured cars would/(D 3 2 . would be necessary to eneb le Sheikh to secure his in terests and that they are unable to give him any undertaking of the nature he describes.

His Majesty’s Government approve proposals in paragraph 4 of your telegram with modification that for ’teerious incursions” they would substitute ’’serious and unprovoked attack”. They assume, however, that Sheikh fully realises (c.f. my telegram of 2nd March, 1934, 582) that they will expect him to take all reasonable steps for his and for maintaining orde: which they attach much importance. 3. It is the case that our normal practice is not uo grant recognition, and His Majesty’s Government would pr^fei to maintain this policy. On the other hand there have teen exceptions, (e.g. the present Sheikh of Bahrein was . recognised as Heir Apparent in 1901). If, however, recognition ox Hamad as Heir Apparent is essential to clinch matters, His Majesty's Government, subject to anyfurther views of Government of India, would be prepared to consider granting recognition as special case. (Sine qua non ox their recognition of any new Sheikh would of course be lull acceptance by him of obligations of Qatar Treaty ox 191b, ' which there would be advantage, if possible, in converting into an 'heirs and successors' treaty). Unusual nature of concession which this would represent, particularly in view2 . of Hamad 1 o unpopularity, might he employed not only to ies over clinch oil question, hut to remove difficult! jui isdiGiion, intelligence officers, etc. Jui isomction. His Majesty 1 s Government agree that you ^noula tame line proposed in paragraph 8 (a) of your telegram. You might also make play v/ith objections taken ba Qatar in 19&lt;co to his own subjects falling under Bahreini jurisdiction (see P.G-. 13, page 63, paragraph 10). They are advised, however, that there is no strict construction oi 'British protected persons' and to that extent our hands are free. Nor is there, even at present time, uniformity of practice in dealing with these matters in the Gulf. Jurisdiction exercised in Bahrein by His Majesty’s Government extends to subjects of Moslem foreign States, including Gulf States, as well as to other foreigners. In Koweit, on the other hand, jurisdiction over subjects of Moslem foreign States, including Gulf States, vests in Sheikh. If, for any reason, it was thought desirable to concede this point in Qatar there ai e thus pood pi ecedents. 5. Subject to remarks in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, His Majesty’s Government approve action proposed in paragraph 8 of your telegram under reply and agree that you should present letter personally. 6. They are prermred to leave time-table to you, out think it important to secure necessary assurance from Sheikh if possible before signature of Oil Agreement and in any event with, minimum of delay thereafter. They feel strongly that our position would be much weaker in dealing with from other parties once Company's option has expired. advances9 ‘ sS -T P.Z.Tlia/34. Mr. Walton, 4°i (i Mr. Lefroys letter of 19th November brings to notice one slightly disturbing fact which has hitherto been overlooked, viz. that the sheikh of Qatar's Treaty is personal to himself and aoes not in terms bind his heirs ana successors. The point was never raised or referred to in the discussions of 1913-1916 which culminated in the present Treaty, and there is nothing to show why in this instance we departed from our general practice. The fact that the position of the present Sheikh was somewhat uncertain at the date of the Treaty is hardly a sufficient reason, and the most probable explanation is perhaps oversight. In practice we should, I imagine, recognise a particular successor and require him, a s a condition of recognition, to accept the obligations contained in the Treaty of 1916 in return for a reciprocal acceptance of the obligations which, under that Treaty, fall upon and we might then endeavour to modify the Treaty so that the reciprocal obligations accepted under it shall apply not only to the Ruler, but to his 'heirs and successors' 1 . £. The point is of importance because on the existence of the Treaty hangs our whole position as regards control of the grant of oil concessions by the Sheikh; the alienation of land; the acceptance of a Political Agent, etc. If the Qatar oil concession goes through we shall be undertaking a new and specific obligation to the sheikh as regards protection by land and we could, if necessary, make this an excuse for suggesting a revision of the Treaty of 1916, in the course of which the obligations undertaken by the two H.C.P. would be expressed as extending to the sheikh*s heirs and successors, (it might2 « * % toe possible even to make some play with the concession which an extension of the benefits of the Treaty would represent on our part). But on the whole I am still rather apprehensive of the Sheil^h’s reaction to any suggestion of revision. He might well make difficulties over the clauses about slavery ana the right to appoint a British representative^ which we have hitherto refrained from enforcing* For the moment I propose, if you agree, to reply to Mr. Lefroy as in the draft below. But we must bear the Treaty point in mind and might consiaer it further when the negotiations have reached a more advanced stage. (3d.) J.G. LAITHWATTE. 22.11.34. Mir. Laithwaite, I agree.

The omission is described as an 'oversight' on the part of the British Government. Also discussed is the question of the recognition of an heir apparent, and the definition of British jurisdiction in Qatar. The Political Resident also reports a request from the Shaikh of Qatar for permission to import in excess of his annual quota of 500 rifles, and permission to purchase machine guns and armoured cars. The British were prepared to concede the former, but not the latter.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Anglo-Qatar Treaty (1916)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000180#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
