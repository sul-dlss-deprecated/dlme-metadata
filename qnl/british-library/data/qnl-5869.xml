Even if general hostilities should begin it is unlikely that Italy would attempt to occupy positions on the Saudi-Arabian coast, since they already possess bases in Eritrea which are in a more favourable strategical position from which to threaten British communications in the Red Sea- Nor is it likely that Italy will v/ish to add Saudi Arabia to her enemies. But in the unxikexy event of Italy taking such action. His Majesty's Government in their own interests, if for no other reason, would take steps to restore the position. 3 C . His Majesty's Government have no reason to suppose that Iraq has any hostile designs against any other State, even including Koweit. The recent Iraqi propaganda about conditions returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] (E 3041/177/25). Cypher telegram to Sir R. Bullard (Jedda). Foreign Office. 27th April* 1939. 10.00 p.m. No. 69. IMPORTANT A Confidential IL T'! a o • w #o iCj r, l+. in Koweit has certainly been tronblesome s but His Majesty's Govern ment have repeatedly made it clear to the Iraqi Government that they will not tolerate any modification of its status and this being so they find it difficult to take this propaganda seriously in the sense of supposing it will lead to any deliberate attempt to secure such a modification by force. His Majesty's Government would, however, welcome any further action which Ibn Saud might feel dis posed to take to impress upon General Nuri the folly of the agita- ^tion and propaganda dire'ted against Koweito 4. Apart from. Koweit question, Iraqi Government may possibly look forward to the day when Iraq will, they hope, play a leading part in a federation with other Arab States. But here again His Majesty's Government have no reason to suppose that Iraqi Government expect to create this federation by any but peacefuj means. Certainly no such federation could be created except after prolonged disussion in which Ibn Saud would be able to make his views fully known. 5. In the opinion of His Majesty's Government the Turkish Government have no intention, apart from the Hatay, of attempting uO recover any portion of former Ottoman empire. Continued unrest ' V N. in Syria, especially in parts adjoining Turkey may, however, make the Turkish Government feel that some action similar to that whi h has already resulted in the virtual cession of the Hatay is necessary in Turkish interests. In the interests of Syria two things are im portant if this is to be avoided. One is an agreement between France and the Syrians, The other is that the politicians of Damascus, who have hitherto dominated the Governments of Syria and have successfully managed, while in office to antagonise most of the minorities and many of the Arabs (e.g. of Aleppo), should in future adopt methods which will win the confidence and goodwill of all sections of the population.CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIAL .

Article I (a) The Egyptian T resident and his Aasietant have already oeen nominated and accepted. Article Tj(d^ Although under 'rticle VT the t resident has been made TTrst a conciliator and then an arbitrator for all differences regarding the alignment submitted to him, this provision has been inserted to prevent his overruling the two ? ?epreaenta11 ves when they happen to be agreed. The desirability of such a provision is euggeatod by experience with colonel Tselin on the Iraqi-' yrian Demarcation commission. Article IV(c) It is impossible to start demarcation without fixing tHla point since it is the western terminal of two straight lines to be demarcated. It is understood that the terrain is here very flat and the junction of the 'adi al Auja ana the BBtln by no means obvious. The patin can be followed more clearly than the Auja. The Koweiti authorities might feel that the point had been fixed too far south or too far north, in the former cases they would presumably have no complaint; in the latter they could claim as against Baudiya another starting point further south in which case the frontiers would run like this : Instead of like this ? Article iv(d • cimilsrly It would be impossible to demarcate the last sector of the frontier west of &gt;nigur without fixing the terminal point. The following diagram illustrates the possibilities : Cfaudiya claim the point A Is tho topminal # Transjordan claim B# while Iraq maintain that the line passes from i/ugur first to A or B and thence on to C* If the arbitrator chose B or A Transjordan would presumably have no complaint. If the arbitrator accepted the Iraqi thesis of a prolongation from A or B to C and Transjordan successfully challenged it subsequently as against Traq f then the pillars erected between A d C or B A C would fall in r'audi territory and be ignored and the demarcated line from ? f ugur to a or b (as the case might be) would stand. Article y The point of this article is to try to ensure that t'He d'ocuments required by the president shall be ready in good time before he arrives. Articl e VTfa) 'Tils refers to the differences of opinion between the two iovernments already established by correspondence between thee. The Iraqi thesis is that in order to conform to the require«entffi of rticl© ifb) of the Treaty of uhamnera the frontier must be drawn in such a way as to leave the wells mentioned In rticle t(d'&gt; of the Pirat i rotocol of Uqalr, from jumaima to vugur f to the country who^e trlboo own the wells. The ?audi thesis is that the rotocol constitutes the final interpretation of the Treaty and that the welle or group of wells Giuflt be divided (op perhaps held in common'. This question of interpretation must be settled before the demarcation can proceed eastward from Ansab the eastern point of the M neutral w or rather 'shared” sone. Article v t ■ a jjh' &amp; (o) . on ttie poaul-Turkish boundary the real dent was no£ an arbi trator and decisions were taken by a majority, rf the &gt; resident propoeed a solution different from that of each of the arties* one or other had to Abandon his own proposal and accept that of the * resident. The procedure is unnecessarily clumsy and must results either in a deadlock or the ?resident*a appearing to side with one party when in fact he is not. Tt is simpler to make the president first a conciliator and then an arbitrator. Article VTI . This type of pillar has proved most satisfactory on the Traqi-ryrian bounday.&lt; 20 %. \C Telegram Prom To Heoeated Inter. Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, London.

Hollowing is summary of instructions following by despatch: In theory His Majesty’s Government cannot question any decision which two Governments may reach with regard to tiieir common frontier including termination points, provided result does not infringe their interests. But in practice no termination point can be settled satisfactorily without co-operation of three countries. 2. They are therefore anxious that no final decision should be taken about these points unless they have first expressed their views. They are considering, unwillingness to have to accept decision of Egyptian President, no matter what it may be. 3. As regards 7estern termination question is not to be as Iraqi note claimed to fix intersection of two co-ordinates but to find termination point of Daudi - Iraqi frontier. This lies, in view of His Majesty’s Government, at summit of Jebel Anaza, as has already been explained to Iraqi Government. * 4. \s regardS/^eastem termination point Caudi-Iraoi and ICuwait-lraqi frontier are both said to start at junction of Tadi Al Aujah with Al Batin. Provided therefore that this point is clear on grounds there should be no difficulty.n 2 . 5. You should txherefore, if you see no objection, reply Ir^qi G-ovemment on lines of following paragraph. 6. Note of July 3th has been referred to Yis T.Tajesty’s Government who note that two Governments intend to settle co non frontier including its eastern and western termination points through a joint commission under an Egyptian President. His Yajesty’s Government regard this as a very satisfactory way of settling any difficulties which may have arisen between two Governments over this frontier. Jince work pf the Commission will cover the two termination points where questions affecting Trans-Jordan and Kuwait territory will be involved a decision by President which ran contrary to vie,vs of His Najesty’s Government might lead to the necessity of further negotiations between the two parties and His HajestyVs Government jointly. When therefore the positions of two termination points come to be discussed His Najesty's Government Till gladly explain to two parties and Egyptian President their of views/proper position of two points. This can probably best be done upon ground and if they are given adequate notice they will do their best to send representatives to explain their views to Commission when it reaches neighbourhood of these two points. -Secretary of State for foreign Affairs-CONFIDENTIAL No. 86/35/40.
