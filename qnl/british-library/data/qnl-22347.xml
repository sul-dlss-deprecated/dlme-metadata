I said that he was agent of the A. P. 0. G and that he icnew that the American Company were trying to get into (^atar and that , though naturally we got information , it was desirable to get early information in this matter. I emphasizdd that I did not want anything against the ihterests of Shaikh 'Abdullah who was an old friend,but that it was in his interests as well as those of the Company and the Government that the American Company should not be permitted to place him in a wrong position. I said that if he would give us information ,if he heard of anything valuable,from time to time,we shd be very pleased and our friends would be rewarded. When/leaving iI said that he had had trouble and expense in coming |to Bahrain and I would like to give him his expnses - and Information is not be oe signed but sent in private envelopes through Yusuf Kanoo,whora 'K* can trust. I assured jhim that his name would not be written on paper and that only Saiyid 'Abdul Raz.aq and I Rnew it. he was I handed him a bag of Rsl50 4.34Translation of letter dated the 10th Muharram 1353(25th or 24th April 1934) from K. Nothing happened during the last few days which worth reporting* In my opinion that it would be more appropriate if any one comes during these days on behalf of the company as 3alih as“Sulaiman(al hani’) has today left for Bahrain by sailing boat. Any person who may come will have a.n opportunity to discuss matters with the Shaikh and will also be able to come to some understanding with Shaikh Hamad and can explain anything which he wants and thus get an opportunity with him if (Hamad). I think that/KaJ j i Yusuf Kanu acts as a mediator ne might be able to convince the Shaikh and get some result from him. Any person who may te sent should come quitely so that Salih may not cay to him * I will a.ccompany you and back * x then will come/. He should keep his departure secret. As previously said by me Kanu will be able to get some result from the Shaikh. There is no harm in sending a man as in case of not being successful you will be able to get the final thing and will be able to arrange matters in the manner you like. As for us you may rest assure that 7/e will report any fact about the slightest thing to you when it happens.P.A 'lx* arrived today. He came with ti;e ^arty who went to ixC Ip the Hu wait sailing boat wnich w a b wrocHod near C^.atar £uid brought the crew to Bahrain. He wrote me the attached chit saying that he wants to leave for tatar tomorrow and wants to come and see me in my house tonight at £.30 Arabic (‘-•20 p.m.) Before I see him may I knov/ if you have any orders for me about him.

He brought a letter from Bin Jalawi enclosing a letter from Bin Sa’ud dated liahhali the 14th Safar(B9th May). It contained nothing except salams. On his arrival Sliaikh ’Abdullah did not pay much attention to him# he was given the two rooms to the north of the Shaikh’s palace at Kaiyan to live in. On Thursday night,after they had dinner,he had a private interview with tne Shaikh and his son Hamad in the upper room for about one and a half hours. On the next morning the Shaikh showed more respect to him and his rooms were furnished with more carpets, Friday night he again had an interview with the 3haiMi/at about 10 P.M. and on Saturday night he left “a.yan for Hasa ;at about 10 P.M.

At this stage Rs.acoA was due to n K n , but due to the useless inforiaation, or rather to the f©ct that he had supplied no information of value. Colonel uoch offered him Rs.250/- and not the full Rs.900/- due to him. refused to accept Rs.?50/- and reminded ^olonel Loch that he had promised him Rs.l50/~ a montn ujiconditionally. Jnder the circu stances Colonel Loch feels tne.t the full Rs.900/- should be paid to him and requested rue to recover this amount from you. Yours sincerely, The honourable Lieut-Coionei T.C.Foyie, C.B.r., Political Resident in the Persian U uif, Bahrain.Abadan, Persian Gulf. 25th April 1935. My dear Cole, I have been keeping an eye on the doings of one Nasir al Mana* of Qatr. Your clerk Sayid Abdul Razzaq can give you particulars of him; amongst other things Nasir is under auspicion for trading in arms and slaves by sea. Nasir arrived last week with letters for the Sheikh. I suspect one was from Holmes received via Hussain al Tatim, but naturally I cannot prove this. Another letter was from a doctor of the American Mission, regretting that when the Sheikh asked for an American doctor, the Political Agent did not pass on the request; this letter also effers to sena an American doctor to v^atr at any time the Snaikh may desire it. Nasir al Mana will leave here probably a.m. on the 27th via Khuwair for Bahrain and according to my information will carry a reply to the American Mission asking for a doctor to be sent at once. He will also carry a letter to you asking you to authorise an American doctor to visit latr to attend to the Sheikh. I am not in a position as you will realise to prove this information, but no doubt you could check it up in Bahrain. If you do receive a re ^est to allow an American doctor to visit atr, you will be inclined to creuit my information. Loch was of opinion that the American Mission was interfering a&gt;n w.atr on behalf of the S.O.C., and according to local gossip here, Loch has on more than one occasion refused the necessary permission for American doctors to visit atr. The Sheikh 1 s skin affection on his hand has cleared entirely and the abscess on his ankie is much improved. He does not therefore stand in urgent need of medical attention and in my opinion there is no justification for an immediate visit from an American or any other doctor.My affairs are going on reasonably well and will reach a crisis in a few days time. If therefore you can delay the arrival of any American doctor until after the 4th May I shall be most obliged. Yours sincerely, Sd: Chas.L.Mylles.K 1. About five months ago Husain Yatim wrote a letter to Shaikh was sent with a special messenger named ’Abdullah bin Fardan to Salih bin Mani*. Yatim wrote to the Shaikh that the Company were willing to give 10 per cent more than any offer by the a.P.O.C. Previous to this Yatim also wrote a letter to the Shaikh asking permission for Mr.Skinner to visit the Shaikh. Shaikh ’Abdullah replied that he welcomed the visit of Mr. Skinner provided it was a private visit a.nd has nothing to do with business. He also replied a.bout the concession saying that he was not prepared to discuss the question of oil with them before the period given to the a.P.O.C. was over and that no agreement is arrived at between him and the a.P.O.C. during this period. 2 ‘ In the month of Shauwal(February 1934) Kijji bin ^asim bin Injji, clerk of the Hasa company wrote a letter to the Shaikh saying that the Company were prepared to give better offer than that of the A.P.O.C. to which the Shaikh replied that he was not prepared by land to Qatar by the hand of the Sa’i(messenger) to one Ibrahim al Lingawi, clerk of Muhammad bin 'Abdur Kahman Fakhru of to en/ter into any discussions about the oil until the period which is given to the A.P.O.C. was over. H-ijji again wrote a letter to the Shaikh and a reply was also sent to him. The letters were sent Qatar. l</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000193_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/924</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000193</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/924</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Reports of K'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-07-16T21:54:01</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (17 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 19; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The contents of the file relate to 'K' an individual whose name was at the time known only to the Political Agent (Percy Gordon Loch) and Head Munshi (Saiyid 'Abdul Razzaq) at Bahrain and who provided information and intelligence on affairs in the Persian Gulf, particularly attempts by American oil companies to compete for an oil concession in Qatar.The file contains correspondence includes letters and reports written by 'K', and a letter from the Political Agent at Bahrain regarding the decision to dispense with 'K's services in April 1935.Also included in the file are intelligence reports from 1935 written by Charles Clark Mylles, an employee of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company based in Qatar, regarding the activities of certain locals believed to be acting on behalf of American oil interests.
