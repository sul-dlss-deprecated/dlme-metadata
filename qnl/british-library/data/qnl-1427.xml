Political Department. From, To, The Political Superintendent, Upper Sind Frontier. The Commissioner in Sind, Kurra-Chee. Political Superintendent's Office, Jacohahad, \2th August 1870. In forwarding for your information the accompanying letter No. 35, dated 13th ultimo, from the Political Agent, Khelat, to my address, I have the honor to observe that the last clause of para. 3, and the whole of para. 4, contain really good and useful information regarding His Highness' arrangements for the protection of the route from Khelat to Sonmeanee, which are deserving of high commendation. 2. The rest of the letter, especially paras. 2 and G, give an entirely one-sided view of matters, which would lead distant authorities, unacquainted with local details, to enter tain extreme ideas upon the subjects noted. 3. The favor of either the original or a copy of Captain Harrison's letter, now forwarded, being returned, is solicited. I have, &amp;:c., U. PHAYPtE, Colonel, Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. From, No. 35 of 1870. The Political Agent, Khelat. To, Sir, The Political Superintendent, Upper Sind Frontier. Khelat, \%th July 1870. All the principal men of the Mingul tribe have just left Khelat ; it may be interesting to Government to know the arrangements that were entered into prior to their departure. 2. At the first Durbar, at which they were present. His Highness asked them what ho had ever done to induce them to take an active part in every dispute and rebellionthat had taken place, as ho was not aware of having wronged or offended the tribe in any way whatsoever; they responded that they never had any grievance at all, and that they had been compelled to act in an hostile and unbecoming manner by their Sirdar Noordeen, that they were heartily sick of his intrigues, and hoped a Sirdar would be appointed, who would have their confidence as well as that of His Highness. 3. This being by no means an unusual procedure in the Government of this Khanate, His Highness said that he would think over the matter, and on a subsequent occasion, intimated that he should probably select Noordeen's first cousin, Meah Ma homed. This selection was unanimously approved of, and they asked His Highness to entrust some special duty, by performing which, their good intentions might be ap parent. Their suggestion was, that they should be allowed to take active measures against Sirdar Noordeen. His Highness however diverted their ideas into a more useful and practical channel, and suggested that as the best Kafila route lay through their country, that they could show their good will, by protecting them and helping to redress all grievances made by merchants. 4. The Mingul country runs from Sohrab to the boundary of Wud. His Highness therefore made the following arrangements, viz, that Meah Mahomed should be respon sible for transit between Khelat and Wud, and his cousins, Morad Ali and Esan Khan, from that place to Sonmcanee. The latter residing at Bey la, and acting in conjunction with Shagassee Goolam Jan. 5. These details having been approved of, His Highness told the MinguTs that they were at liberty to go when they liked, and having presented them with suitable Kheluts&gt; officially installed Meah Mahomed as Sirdar of the Minguls, vice Noordeen. 6. During the fourteen years Noordeen was Sirdar of the Minguls, he took part in as many rebellions, was twice imprisoned, and murdered his own uncle. Khan Mahomed, the father of the present Chief. His Highness has all through shown great forbearance, and intends making suitable provision for Noordeen's wives and children. I have, See., C. W. HARRISON, Captain, Political Agent, Khelat, No. 514 of 1870. Political Depaetment. Commissioner's Office, Kurrachee, Hth August 1870. Submitted to Government. The whole of Captain Harrison's report, the Commis sioner thinks, is very satisfactory, and he sees nothing in it calling for the discredit expressed by Colonel Phayre in the 2nd para, of his forwarding letter.
