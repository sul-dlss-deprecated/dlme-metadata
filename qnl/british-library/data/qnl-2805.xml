The Political Agent, Bahrain. rhe Secretary to Kon'hle the Political Resident in the Persian Grulf, Bushire. I have the honour to say that I find it impos sible to carry on the work of this Agency with the present staff, and that the English Office staff is utterly inade quate for the strain placed upon it. The work of the vernacular office has also increased though in a smaller degree but I a ? : at present only asking for an extra clerk in the English Office. lou will naturally inquire why I find it impos sible to manage with the same staff that my predecessors had, and the reason is that the work is greatly increased as the English Office figures I quote will show# The slpff, namely one i-ead Olerk and a second clerk, have not l^en increased since 1912, when Bahrain had no wire less Jpd was a little more than a township. I give the totals of letters and telegrams recei tx an sent for 1927 and 1928 but tue figures ior 19291 li ju till tLe of Ilovember only. 1927.m i / # Letters received Letters sent Telegrams issued Telegrams received 1927 1096 1049 183 15 960 900 163 25 1929. 1640.(11 months . 1626. Tf only) 426 TT 101 ' ' Letters received in the Vernacular Office and letters and telegrams received in the confidential office are excluded. These facts apeak for themselves. The greatest increase has been in the number of telegrams and the work of coding and decoding messages received in the two Govern- ment codes has proved such an intolerable strain that I have been obliged to discontinue the practice of coding telegrams This will occasion a loss to Government of over 1000 rupees this quarter, and during the next financial year probably Ks3000/- ^ It may be considered that this extra work is only a passing phase, and has'ireen in some way brought on the Agency by my own action, l^ith the exception of the work in connection with overseas trade (which I have been oblijed to discontinue in spite of the very promising results already attained) I can confidently say that nothing h^s been done which could reasonably have been left undone. When the strain of coding^decyphering messages is considered it will be realised that a telegram is never sent unless it was absolutely necessary, 6wing to all our communication being by wireless this vsork is particularly arduous in stormy weather and messages are invariably full of corrupt groups The Agency is being constatly called upon to take ork. The arrival of the Air Force has made a great increase, and this will not be diminished by the permanent presence of their personnel in the near future or the arrival of the Heajaz Air Force. The upper Air observers are paid by the Agency and provide a considerable amount of work.&amp; &amp;— 'J - - t 'm 1 iI m Ml S work. It was suggested 'by this office, that they should have their pay bills sent in triplicate so as to save copying here, but the Accountant General, Central Revenues vetoed the suggestion. The Bahrain (lovernment continually require staff « or equipment from India and it rarely occurs that their needs can be met without the Agency being involved, Since the control of their foreign relations is vested in the British Government it is impossible for their growing activities not to affect the Agency, and the increased coastal traffic in launches and in motors in Hasa, has speeded up communications and complicated life to an extent which can scarcely be believed. In fact, Bahrain,once a small port in a cul-de-sac, is now the most important port in a new world's high way. Pearl merchants have commenced bringing their drillers here, and now that electric light is being instal led there is little doubt that more and more skilled men will come to Bahrain and it will become more than ever the centre of the Eastern pearl trade, Bombay being already to some extent supplanted. This will not occur without increasing the work done by the Agency. A* 4 - The increase of staff I ask for is^really effi cient and trustowrthy Short-hand Typist. Such a man could be obtained dn a 3 years contract at RsEOO/- p.m. and I yvA favour a temporary appointment as no clerk 4rom the cadre has the (qualifications required. This man would type all important letters, and would undertake the coding and de coding of all telegrams. I would also like to place him in charge of the confidential office for: the clerical work here (this is quite separate from the English office) is at present, for reasons which I am mentioning in a separate letter, entirely carried out by the Political Agent, Here again a great increase has taken place. During first fourp: i nil -ifi V M four months I received more letters than were received in the whole of 1927 or 1926, and the total numbers of letters received in the year will be some 600 as compared 177, 171, 306, in 1926, 27, 28 respectively. The only reason that the outward letters did not increase in proportion was that it was impossible to deal with everything myself and r^any letters and telegrams which would normally have gone from this office were dealt with in the English office. At present the English office work seven days a week, and on mail days till 6 p.m. and they have been busy throughout the Christmas holidays. It is only in the G-ulf that clerks are expected to work like this and there would be a terrible outcry if one made the same demands on one T s staff in India. In making this claim I would like the following facts to be i;apressed on the Govern ent of India. Bahrain probably earns more money in Court fees than any other Political Agency under their control. In 1927 and 1928 these fees amounted to M8194 and iiL7642 respectively and paid for the entire pensionable staff of the office including the Indian Assistant. Apart from this the P 0 st Office, who are housed free in the Agency building make an annual profit of nearly seven thousand rupees, and, since they owe their existence to the Agency, this should also be taken into account. I therefore trust that the Hon'ble the Political Resident will see his way to supporting my request, Tshich I have made as moderate as possible. Should the work conti nue to increase and the oil company commence operations on anv scale it will be necessary repost an Assistant Foii- * tical Agent here but in the meantime I yill try to carry on with one extra clerk. I have the honour to be, &gt; Sir, Your most obedient servant, fc ^ Political Agent, Bahrain. K/--r 5 Ttltgraia. G.T.C«cI «c Fi^oiii - EiXlDtl Rtridtnt, Buoiiii®. T» Jialirain.

I regret to say that in submitting my proposal for the appointment of an additional oJierk to Bahrein, I made a slip. f,'} i 3. in paragraph 6 of ay letter No. 619 dated the'4th March 1930, I requested the Govemmont of India to sanction one upper division clerk to the clerical cadre of the Persian Gulf for employment at Bahrein and asked that he should draw the same allowances as were being provided for the present 2nd Clerk at Bahrein under the Revision 3oheae. I overlooked the fact that the 2nd Olerk at Bahrein is a lower division clerk and not an upper division clerk. a lower division clerk draws Hs .25A per mensem Gulf Allowance while an upper division clerk draws Hs. 35/- per mensem. In accordance with my proposal the Government of India have been pleased to Sanction for the new clerk at Bahrein the rate of pay of an upper division olerk, but a Gulf Allowance of Bs. 25/- per mensem instead of Rs* 35/-. It #a8 notM] | y i. * « 2m 4 21 not my Intention that the olerk at Bahrein should draw a lower rate of Gulf Allowance than qther upper division clerks and it is essential that he should he placed on an equality with theroi since otherwise any upper division clerk posted to Bahrein would automatically lose Hs. 10/- a month pay, I would therefore request that the Government of India will he pleased to revise their order and sanction a Gulf allowance at the rate of Ra» 35/- per mensem for the additional clerk for the office of the Political Agentt Bahrein. 4. One of the chief objects of the revision scheme» apart from benefiting the clerks already serving in the Persian Gulf, was to enable a more suitable type of am to be recruited in the future. I have therefore considered carefully the names of the applicants for the post of additional clerk at Bahrein. The most suitable applicant is a Tar. Fazl Rahman at present ih non-pensionable Govern ment employ at Mesned who is known to me personally. He is above tho ordinary run of clerks employed in the Gulf in intelligence and is in addition a fully qualified stenographer, but he is 30 years of age and he has repres'entod to me that in view of his special qualifications and attainments he should be placed on an equality with other clerks of his age on the cadre. I consider this request reasonable having regard to all the oircumstancos of the case. An upper division clerk will normally be reeruited at about 25 and by 30 will be drawing -Hs. 150/- per memsem. Although as a general rule I am averse from grants of premature increments, I consider that in the present case they would be justified, and would therefore request that the Government of India would under Fundamental Bule 27 be pleased to allow the clerk in question to start on an initial pay of Hs.lSO/ *s.

Bahrain is used as a transit port by the Company and is frequently visited by its personnel# (3). ihe transfer of the Maval Station f^om Henjam. (4). The increase in work in connection with the operations of the Hoyal Air Force along the Jrucial Coast. In some months, their accounts amount to Ife,4,000/- involving many entries and cash payments. (5). The placing of Qatar and the Trucial Coast under the superintendence of the Political A^ent, Bahrain. In this connection, the establishment of an Oil Conpany in qatar is bound to lead to an increase of work in the isn^lish Office. (6). The work in connection with the control of liquor imports is increasing due to the growth of the European, American and Jfon-Muslim British Indian Communities* (V)» #ork in connection with the maintenance of the Bushire Toshakhana. 4. I attach statements in support of the above showingi- (a). The increase in Treasury work. (b). The increase in receipts and issues of letters and telegrams and the increase in registration of British subjects. The figures do not include a large amount of minor correspondence, in connection with passport and Koyal Air Force work, which is unregistered. 5. At present the Knglish Office Staff work from 8.30 to 1.30 and from 3 p.m. to 6.30 n m ^« y uu o.ou p.m. and sometimes later. This90 v This is In spite of the fact that a considerable amount of assistance is given by the ttinshis in the Vernacular Office, which in turn means that the Vernacular Office has to observe similarly long hours. Should an extra clerk be sanctioned the Vernacular Office Staff would be free to perform their legitimate duties only - one of which is to find a reader and clerk for the Court of the Assistant Political Agent# A Munshi often is not available for this in^ortant duty. 6. £he appointment of an Assistant political Agent is in itself indicative of the in ere as in work in the Agency. 7. lEhe clerk required would be employed as I^pist and Hecord Keeper and form part of the permanent English Office establishment in the lower division, on the time scale of pay at present in force.

In 1925 the administration of Bahrain was placed on a regular basis. A British Adviser to the Bahrain Ooveminent and a British Director of Customs were appointed. An armed xoiice ioroe was raised The administration has changed in less than a decade from a purely tribal autocracy which was beyond measure corrupt and inefficient! to a system which combines a large measure of efficiency in essentials with the retention so far as possible of the best features of the old tribal rule* This change has led to a great increase in the work of the Agency Office. The institution of the Air .uoute along the Arab Coast of the Persian C^ulf, the establishment ofthe H&amp;yal Base In Brhrain, tho dovelopment of the oil field of the Bahrain Petroleum CoBpany, the opening up of atar 'by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and exploration for oil and other ninerals on the Truci^l Copst have also entailed a great and growing volume of extra work, especially as owing to toe loss of the Lawrence and the unaccommodating attitude of the Iranian Govemment the Truolal Coast has had to he placed under the supervision of the Political Agant^ Bahrain^ Xhn establishment of the Bahrain Jrolroleum Company has brought laauy auropeaus and Americans to the island with an attendant demand for all kinds of assistmoe from the Agency, and their standard of office work iaekes a greater ue^and Worn the Agency office inevitable * relief baii afforded to the iolitical Agent himself 'by the appointment of an Assistant Political /igent, 'out this in turn has led to greatei* demands upon the Agency correspondence and in Treasury work, but those figures do not hy themselves give a true picture of the increase in work, for a groat deal is done in a place like Bahrain by word of mouth, and I should emphasise tt-at in an Arab country business cannot be hurried. * . letters ios.

In view of the secrecy which attaches to rauch of the correspondence of the Bahrain Agency and of the interest %hich ie taken in it 'by persons and institutions hath on the island and elsewhere, special precautions are essential. At • present the work is carried on 'by one cle. k in a little room, once a dressing-room, off the Political Agent's private office, which is aost inconvenient. It is, moreoveri only possihle to cope with the work as the clerk concerned has been doing it since the time when it 'began so rapidly to increase. He can no longer do it 'by hiiaself and in any case must go on leave tthortly t after which he will, 1 think, he promoted. 1 propose that the Confidential Office should continue to work directly under the Political Agent and consist of a Confidential Clerk and a Conticlential otenographer, both of whom should he clerks in the Upper jbiviaion.

Loch's report containing his proposals for reorganising the English section of the Bahrain Agency Office. The facts and figures given in support of the proposed increase of establishment speak for themselves. I entirely agree with the view expressed in paragraph 6 of 3ol. Loch 's letter cited above that, in view of the recent develop ments in Bahrain itself and the Trucial Uoast area gene rally, it is no longer possible to regard the Bahrain Agency uffice as a political office of the old days in the Persian Culf, and that it needs to he reorganised to.... The Hon'hle Lieut-Colonel !• 0. w. Fowle, C.B.iS., Political si dent in the i-ersian ^lf. The ^orei^n Secretary to the C^vernment of India,to meet the ne^ and ever increasing demands upon it. Z. It will 'be observed that Col. Loch proposes to divide the English uffice into two sections, viz., the general inglish section find the Confidential section, the former to ;e composed of a Gazetted Cfiicer in place of the present Head Clerk, two Upper division clerkb and one Lower .Division clerk; and the latter to consist of two upper Division clerks. -he proposal thus involves the creation of one gazetted appointment of Hegistrar and Treasury officer, and three additional aipointments of clerks in the Upper Division (including the temporary appointment sanctioned in the Government of India, foreign -V end Political Department, telegram l^o. 1089- , dated the 25rd October 193C). Against this increase, the appoint ments of Head Clerk and Passport Clerk ai e proposed to he abolished. 4. 1 strongly suj^ort the recommendation for the creation of three additional appointments of clerks in the Upper Division against the abolition of the post of lassport Clerk, hut in oroer to reduce the cost of the proposed scheme, I consider that there should be no Ojjange fbr the present in the status ana emoluments of the post of Head Clerk#. I accordingly attach a revised proposition statement, marked excluding the proposed gazetted post of Registrar and Treasury Officer, The average extra cost of tho proposed scheme, as modified above, will amount to -s.3,268/- per annum. 5. i would like to add that, since Col. Loch framed his proposals, the Bahrain Petroleum Company are proceed ing apace with their refinery project, thus immediately increasing ...increasing the work of the Agency in every branch# 6» 1, therefore, recommend that the Oovernment of India will T^e pleased to accord very early sanc tion to the a'Dove proposal, and trust that it will 'be possible to arrange for the necessary provision to 'be incltid'^d in the ensuing year's 'budget.

The whole nature and volume of the work in Bahrain has underg )ne a ur rked change in the last fees, years. In 1925 the administration of Bah ain was placed on a regular hasis. A Britis^h Adviser to the Bahrain Government and a iritish .Director of Cu toms were appointed. An armed ^ olice Force was raised. The administration has changed in less than a decade from a purely tribal autocracy which was hoyond measure corrupt and inefficient, to a systam which combines a large measure of erficiency in essentials with the retention so far as possible of the best features of the old tribal rule. This change has led to a great increase in the work of the A_gency. Office, The institution of the Air Route along the Arab Coast of th^ Persian Gulf, the estriblishment of the flaval Base in Bahrain, the development of the oil field of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the opening up of ^atar by the Anglo ''Iranian uil Company and exploration for oil and other minerals on the Trucial Coast have also entailed a great and growing volume of extra work, e*pecially as owing to the loss of the lewrence and the unaccomodating attitude ...attitude of the Iranian Government the Trucial Coast has hafl to he placed under the supervision of the Political Agent, Bahrain. The establishment of the Bahrain Petroleum Company has brought many Europeans and Americans to the island with an attendant demand for all kinds of assistance from the Agency, and their standard of office work makes » greater demand from the Agency Office inevitable. Relief has been afford ed to the Political Agent himself by the appointment of an Assistant Political Agent, but this in turn has led to greater demands upon the Agency Office. 3. I enclose figures which show the increase in correspondence and in freasury work, but th^se figures do not by themselves give a true picture of the increase in work, for a great deal is done in a place like Bahrain by word of mouth, and i should emphasise tkat in an Arab country business cannot be hurried. ** ** ** 5. I propose that a regular Confidential Office shall be established in the Bahrain Agency. In view of the secrecy which attaches to much of the correspondence of the Bahrain Agency and of the interest which is taken in it by persons and institutions both on the island and elsewhere, special precautions are essential, ^t present the work is carried On by one clerk in a little room, « once a dressing-room, off the lolitical Agent s private office, which is most inconvenient, it is, moreover, only possible to dope with the work as the clerk con cerned has been doing it since the time wi en it began so rapidly to incresse. e can no longer do it him self and in any case must go on leave shortly, after which he will, 1 think, be promoted. 1 propose that the..•-3- a the Confidential Office should continue to work directly under the Politicrl y\gent and consist of a Confidential Clerk and a Confidential Stenographer, both of whom should 'be clerks in the upper Division. The Confidential Clerk must be a man of sufficient standing and length of service to he entrusted with cyphers. It is impos.ihle for the Polltioal Agent to spare time for cyphering and the Assistant Political Agent will seldom, now that ^atar is 'being opened up, he available. I propose that the Con fidential Clerk should receive a special pay of i ^s. 35/- a month in addition to the special pay of ivs.35/- attach ing to the Upper Division posts in the ierslan Uulf in view of the responsible and confidential nature of his work. ioth he and the Confidential stenographer are like ly to have to work longer hours than is usual in an ordi nary office. The Confidential 3tenographer must also 'be an Upper Division clerk because of the secrecy and responsibility of his work and because it is desirable to have a man of some standing as he will accompany the lolitical ^gent on his tours. I propose that the Confidential stenogra pher shall also receive an additional special pay of as . 35/- a month in view of the confluential nature of his work and the special qualification of stenography which is desired of him because a great deal of the Political Agent's work involves interviews which must be com itted to paper as soon as they are over in order that a clear record may be kept of the business which is being transacted. 6. 1 propose that the English Cfllce shall in future consist of a Kegistrar and Treasury Officer, two clerks in the Upper Division lone of whom must be a skilled accountant) and one Lower Division Clerk, who must be a really competent typist.Owing to the increased complexity and responsibi lity of the work and the fact that the head of the Agency office has to transact husin ss ano live in social con- tack with a number of well paid clerks of important comrneidsl institutions (the Bahrain Petroleum Company Linited, the Eastern Bank Lijaited f Ce ble and wireless Limited and so on) I consider that Lis status siould 'be raised to a gazetted rank and that the emoluments of the appointment should be improved. I propose that a gazetted post of registrar and Treasury Officer should be created on the following termss- Pay Ks* 300-10-550 Special pay Hs* 75 House Kont allowance -us. 50 Although the of rice is not large enough to be divided into definite branches, I propose that the work shall be separated inuo three main cete^ories:- (i) Bahrain affairs (11) i^a'udi, jatar and Irucial Coast affairs (ill) AccountSf budgets, stores. The actual work will have to De divided between the clerks somewhat elastically, but roughly the aivision of labour will make one Upper Division clerk responsible for accounts anu stores and the other, with the help of the Lower division clerk, for records and su emitting ordinary work. 7. If the above strength is sanctioned, I am prepared to dispense with the post of Passport Clerk which was sanctioned in 1925 and of which the pay is m ore than sovered by passport and visa fees, which average ^s. 6000 a year. ** *# ** ** 10.

Political Agency, Bahrain, the 11th April 1936. From Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, Reorganiz ation of the Bahrein Agency A 1 P I have the honour.to refer to the fifth' paragraph of my letter No .13-2 dated the 20th October 1936 regarding the reorganization of the Bahrain Agency Office and to request that a temporary appointment of Confidential Stenographer in the Bahrain Agency may be created pending the orders of Government on the reorganization proposals. 2. Mr. E. Thomas, the Additional Clerk, who did the confidential work including shorthand, has been promoted and his place has been taken by Mr. D .J. Stephens, who has long experience of confidential work, but does not know shorthand. 3. A Confidential Stenographer is urgently required for two reasons: firstly, that much of the Political Agent and Assistant Political Agent's work consists of interviews and conversations which must be/- I I- 2 - be committed to paper without waste of time and| secondly, that if there is only a single clerk in the Confidential office it gravely dislocates work when he goes on the frequent tours which are necessary. 4. I would only add that the work, for which a stenographer is needed, has already been further increased by the activities of Petroleum Concessions Limited in connection with the proposed oil developments here and on the Trucial Coast, and they have up to date only touched the fringe of their activities# 6« As mentioned in my letter referred to above, I would urge that the Confidential Stenographer should be of the status of an Upper Division Clerk because of the secrecy and responsibility of his work and because he will accompany the Political Agent on tours, often in His Majesty's Ships, and should therefore, be a man of some standing# He should, if possible, f be qualified to handle at any rate the less secret cyphers, as it is almost impossible for the Political Agent to co e with cyphering when on tour on the Trucial Coast owing to the time taken up by calls and interviews• 6. I, therefore, recommend that an appointment of Confidential Stenographer may be created for one year in the first instance. I would suggest that he should be offered a consolidated pay and house allowajice of Rs.220/- a month for that year, as that is the sum which the pay and allowances proposed for the permanent post amount to, and that in advertising for candidates mention should be made of the possibility of permanent enr loyment# I have the honour to be, Sir.

V.6.R.K. -BRITCONSDL- ^Cojy to Political Agent, Bahrainmmm m r^l % : n &gt; i The state of confusion existing in the English Office with the constant loss or mislaying of papers is attrihutahle to the fact that one English office is very shorthanded and in consequence the existing Staff is called upon to do more than they can to cope adequately with the volume of work in the Agency office. The English Office maintains all the records — for both the English Office and Vernacular Office, the latter keeping only wholly vernacular correspondence connected with xjs judicial ca^es, pettj claims and complaints, municipal meetings, etc. This necessitates the Recordkeeper*s handling the files of the whole of the Agency office with the exception of the confidential correspondence, which is maintained 'by the Additional Clerk (Mr. E. Thomas). ^ . A short summary of the work done by each member of the English Office will not here be amiss and will help to cut short lengthy explanations. The Head Clerk does all drafting and noting in the English Office, superintends the offices generally and is responsible for matters financial (being the Treasurer and Accountant in theory, while in actual practice the Second Clerk (Mr. Abdul Jabbar) is the Treasurer and Accountant (see belov/). The Head Clerk also superintends all passport Work applications for new passports, visas and endorsee ments, etc.,— and in addition he signs visas and endorsements on passports and issues Certificates of Identity and other travel documents. (5j The A dditional Clerk 1 s (Mr. E.L. Thomas) work is confined wholly to the confidential office and he does not assist in the English Office (except, of course, taking down notes and/or letters dictated ^y/ ■M * (f £' ' Hi 1 II * \ - 3 - do passport work, which is attended to by Mr, Jassim ' tne Third Munshi. (This system was commenced in 1934 by Mr. Worth to lighten the burden Ox 'ork in the English office. Prom what I have ee^ oi it, the system has worked well and mm may continue,! Mr Hidayat Ullah has therefore been drafted into the English Office and is the Hecordkeeper, Typist, Despatcher for local letters, etc., and Coder. The numerous files in this Agency occupy the full time of a separate rec )rdkeeper if they are to be kept in any order and in a state of preservation. The filing of papers, their pagination and fully refer- enoing files takes a clerk the major portion of his office. Translated into actual hours of work therefore, Mr. Hidayat Ullah puts in anything from ,' 9 hours and more of work a day to cope as ahly as he possibly can in the circumstances with his records, |sj typing and despatching and coding and decoding of telegrams. On air mail days he attends to no other work than typing. Pas sport work is done by Mr. Jassim (Third 1 • Munshi) under the supervision of the Head Clerk (see above). In theory then the English Office is being run today on the same establishment (that is, a Head Clerk with a Second Clerk) as was sanctioned in January 19^2, despite the fact that the growing import ance of Bahrain has necessitated the sanction of 'S_ an additional officer — an Assistant Political Agent-- to relieve the Political Agent of all routine work. An additional officer should have additional office staff for the reason that the Assistant Political takes up A-gent almost the same time as does the Political Agent with the Head Clerk, etc. Then again there are many miscellaneuus things which the Assistant/ ■n i Is —i -7 - I - I I b. post ollice (-s lu Uie case 01 'tue j&amp;Aur&gt;A±Li retroieuiii Coiu^^uy — see unaer para^rctj^ri ^(Ij couovej — vve will have more wor-K.

The import assistance work which is at present disposed of by the head Clerk has increased very much and is now a tall time job for a separate clerk. This work which is of routine nature keeps the head Clerk busy the whole day and my prede cessor had no time to supervise and scrutinize the work of other clerks which passed through him. 8. The record of Bnglish Office is in very bad state and files require to be gone through, split up and papers re moved and put on separate files. This work is not possible to be undertaken by the present staff who are with difficulty and by working out of office hours carrying on the daily routine only. in order to cope with the increased work all the clerks attend office regularly, out of office hours, even upto late in evenings, but still the work is not disposed of Feprfiyieudiy-sitf—expeditiously and is in arrears. The account mile books have not been amended for years and a bundle of correction slips has been left by the former accountant. ID. As the Hon 1 bio the Political Resident has been pleased to take up the question of raising the status of the post of head Clerk of this Agency, 1 submit the above facts to you and request that the question of asking for 2 additional clerks for finglish office iMy kindly be considered, oneI read the tolGgram to mean that an allowance of Bk .35/- will be paid to the stenographer, confidential clerk, and to Mr. Haslam who is dealing with cyphers and later to the 3rd clerk in the Confidential Office who has not yet been appointed. Mr. Manian although employed in the Confidential Office is not one of the permanent staff who was drafted from the General Office to relieve pressure of work in the Confidential Office.
