The correspondence is primarily between Charles Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain; the Political Agency in Bahrain; and the Political Residency in Bushire. Much of the correspondence concerns two doctors who held this post, Dr Margaret M McDowall and subsequently, Dr I M A Doeg. On folios 95-99, the file contains a 1945 document entitled 'Notes for Persons Proceeding to Bahrain' that was intended as a brief introduction to the country for recently arrived foreign workers. The document contains information related to Bahrain's political structure, climate, medical facilities, language and food. The file also contains correspondence regarding a doctor named Esther Wingate who was considered as a replacement for Dr Doeg, but not eventually hired.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Medical personnel</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00016e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00016e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
