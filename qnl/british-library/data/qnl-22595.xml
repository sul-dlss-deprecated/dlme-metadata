These same developments and considerations, some of which I mentioned to you on '-Jay 3rd (mistake for May 2nd) compel my Government to declare themselves unable to regard the frontiers laid sown in the eaia conventions as the correct frontiers between them and neighbouring territories in lastern and southern Arabia, with this reservation therefore they declare their readi- -ness to enter into discussion at any time with a view to defining the frontiers in* in a manner consonant with actual conditions and such as secure for this country ana all neighbouring Arab isBJoaitiJLKJK territories essential interests each in a. practical way. w!&lt;n fw'i i At 10 A.M. on Monday the 21st May 1954, Rashid bin « Khalil bin Hasir had an interview with the Political Agent, Bahrain, and the following is the information collected:- JT ~ ' - • H About thirty armed men and ten servants were sent this year to collect the Zakah from the Manasir and the other tribes. This party was headed by Muhammad as-Sahali who was sent from Hasa by the Amir, ’Abdullah bin Jalawi. They were able to collect about ten thousand dollars from the Manasir tribesmen who are living at Jauf and the other side of Qatar. The Zakah is charged at the rate of one doHare for a grown up camel and half a dollar for a young camel. The yearly Zakah collected from the tribesmen is between ten and fifteen thousand dollars. The Zakah has to be paid in cash but when one is not able to do so the men ' ; i t of Bin Jalawi choose the best camel and if/costs Rs.500/- they pay him Rs.100/- only . There are no built houses at all but a number of Barastis(huts). The country of the c Manasir is very fertile and has lot of trees and plenty of water. The Muzakis(Zaka collectors) usually camp at the ’Uqailah which is the summer resort of the Manasir. They then collect the tribesmen and take the Zaka from them. Much inconvenience is caused by collecting the people,andi-. people sometimes die on account of the large crowd. As one leaves Hasa he gets water at the following places on his way* 1. Al Qarah 2. Buhailij 3 .Um Huwaidh 4 .A 1 Bahe.th- Baj a sh 5. A1 Jufaln 6. A1 Quhz 7 »A1 Hamrun S.Bu’aij 13 .^bak Ai LvU lO.Sakak 11. Hakhaledi 12. Ba’aja-h lo.Sala* Abu Khis 14.A1 ’Uqaileh • The Zakah ie- collected in the month of Muharrsm and thas year the Muzakkis came there about the kfiigjju beginning after o. M\aharrem(l5th April 1954) and left/they spent about 25 uwys. Tnere ispread for the motor car from Oman to Hasa which passes through Sabakhat Matti.On Saturday tiie 26til May 1934 Rashid bin Khalil bin Nasir had an interview with P.A. and the following is the information collected from him: ' I visited Dhafrali on six or eight occasions and during the last three years I saw the Muzakis with my own eyes. The people at Dhafrah are all from the Manasir tribes-men and very 1 ' - ■ . ■ : - ■ few persons from other tribes can be had among them. The Muzakis are sometimes changed,but that depend upon the fact whether they! ■ are popular or not. Last year, Badr al ’Utaibi was the head of the party, but, as he was harsh to the people and there were some complaints against him,the Amir of Hasa sent Muhammad as» Sahali this year. The Muzakis go even to Oman to collect the Zaka, but the manner in which it is collected differs from that on Bin Sa’ud’s territory. There the question of Zakah depends upon the state of affairs in Bin Sa’ud’s country. If the Sa’udi Arab Government are engaged in war etc. the Muzakis do not press for the Zaka but take whatever is given to them. But if there is nothing to trouble them in the interior of the country they collect the proper Zaza from the people in Oman and, further go far in the interior to collect the same from them’J. The following are the names of the sub-sections of the tribes at Dhafrah:- MARASIR Albu Rahamah Albu Mundhir Al Mazari’ ,Al Mudahmah Al Marashid Ash Shadud | Al Ma’awsah Al Mataw’ah j »AW AMIR. Al Khamia Al Rashid Al Maqadhah and Al Hawamil. The Hawamil are originally from Najd and are from the Da.wa.sir tribe. y r f A 27 .5*.34C ONFIDENTIAL. Ho . C/553-10/3.?.

To Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qasim ath-Thani, Ruler of Q.atar After 0 omp1iment s, I have the honour to confirm what I have mentioned to you in our conversation of today about the result of ray visit to l London where I went to talk over the question which I discussed with you about the Oil Concession. I have returned to Qatar in order to inform you that although our Company are desirious to meet your demanus as far as possible, they are not able to agree to all your demands which you asked from me when we discussed the general terms and the question of the cash pavment In particluar,our Company do not agree to make, at the end of iour years, a payment of five lakhs and royalties. After considering all your demands about the general terms and the cash payment it has been decided to make a new offer. I should like co explain that if this new offer is not accepted by you during my present stay here tit should be considered as withdrawn new As regards the new offer, I enclose a copy of the/general terms. Article 4 which relates to the cash payment had been omitted. Ion will kindly see that these new general terms include nearly all the points which were previously asked for $y U in the month of October. As regards the cash payment, you asked that three lakhs should be paid.to you at the time of si fe ninp- the conce s ion and then a yearly payment of one lash and fifty thousand rupees for a period of four years after which a sum of five I'-.kho plus royalties should be paid yearly. In the month of October you agreed with me that you should receive 4 shillings on oil, 2 shillings on asphalt and bitumen and two pence on gas. This morning, however, you informed me that you wanted four shillings and three annas on oil. The new terms about the payment wnieh I am nov offering for your acceptance are, that four lakhs will be paid at tin,- time of signing (the concession) and a yearly payment of one lakh for a period of four yea.rsI 2 after which a cum of two lakhs will be paid or royalties whichever is more. The royalties will be paid according to the rate which was accepted by you in the month of October, namely, four shillings, two shillings and twopence. I should be glad to know your views about these new terms and to have an opportunity of discussing the same with you. Reply I have understood what you have mentioned about the cash payment. It is impossible to agree to this and I cannot accept the same. When the question of &amp;£ the royalties and cash payments is settled, the remaining questions about the the terms and the conditions can then be settled and modified.I But before the settlement of the conditions and the terms relating to the cash payments I do not see any necessity to go through them.

There is no doubt that the same developments (besides the considerations of which I had an opportunity of mentioning some to Your Excellency during our friendly conversation of Wednesday last 3rd May) put the Government of His Majesty the King in a position of being compelled to state their inability to consider the frontier line specified in the two above Conventions as actually constituting the correct line offfcheir frontier with the neighbouring territories in the East and South of Arabia.

Dear Colonel Loch of I regret that I have not had the pleasure meeting you and therefore appreciate all the more the letter which you were good enough to send me by the hand of Had i Yusif bin Kanoo; No .C/595 - 10/3‘ dated 14th instant. The position with regard to Qatar is that the General Manager sent Kanoo there ostensibly to make a payment of Rs.5,000/- due to the Sheikh under the existing arrangement and also to ascertain unoffi cially the Sheikh’s attitude towards an extension of the period. ± believe you are aware of this as Mr. Hikington explained the matter to you during his recent visit. Haji Yusif bin Kanoo duly carried out these instructions and reported the result by a letter written in English. Kanoo 1 s letter was not entirely clear to me, particularly his veiled reference to Ibn 3aud. As I wished to understand the matter, and particularly to ensure that no confusion arose through language difficulties I asked Haji Yusif to come to t- as rah to discuss the position. Having done so, it was my intention to consult you, as I know London would wish to have your advice before giving me their instructions. As a result of discussions with Haji Yusif I now understand the position to be as follows (a) 'he Sheikh o a tar is offended that nee:©' tiations have not been resumed before now; the existing arrangement expires on the 6th August and it probably offends his conceit that we have waited until this late date before approaching him + h regard to an extension or alternatively making Wl on 3 a renewed oiler for a Concession.0 -) (fr) ^ .He sees in the present situation the possibility of forcing our hands and compelling- us to make another offer for a Concession: his j-fear being that it an extension is arranged and negotiations postponed he may find himself later obliged to accept terms less favourable than those he has already refused. ( c ) , rie 13 willing and perhaps anxious to extend tne.present arrangement for a further period, but naturally hopes to obtain something better th«n as. 1,500 p.m. His reierence to Ibn oaud is an empty un re at. -- e is under no obligation or pressure from Ibn oaud to deal with any interest recommended ty him,^but on the contrary he is under treaty obligation to accept the advice of E.M. Government. J . ihere is no opposition to us at present nor 1 m prospect. I enclose herewith a copy of our 72-D dated 14th May 1934 &amp; a copy of a literal translation of the Sheikh's reply dated 21st Safar 1353, 'khs laoter being that referred to in your letter uncle t' reply. If 1 have understood the position correctly, then it is clearly desirable that the Company should 'avoid any action_which might lead the Sheikh to think we attach any great importance to the affair, or are in any way perturbed by the near approach of the expiry date of the existing arrangements. i therefore propose (a) to reply formally to the Sheikh in accordance with the attached draft; Kanoo has this letter and will forward it if you approve. 'HO to recommend to my Principals that about the end of this month we send a representative to Qatar to 116 sotiate an extension oi the present arrans&lt;einentson the basis 6 months only existing terms Rs.1,500 p.m. 12 months Rs.2,000 p.m. (c) to recommend to my Principals that Haji Yusif bin Kanoo be_the representative. I think if we send a British employee the Sheikh might be encouraged to demand unreasonable terms. Haji Williamson is not 'persona grata' with the Sheikh and 1 do not think Hassan Juma Eff. Hamwad4. who was in Catar with Chisholm has the necessary status. It would be greatly appreciated by my Principals and myself if you would kindly advise on the proposed line of action. A further point occurs to me and you might be disposed to express an opinion on it also. On the assumption that there is no opposition from other interests, and which in any case cannot, i believe, open negotiations without the approval of Government, it might serve to bring the Sheikh to reason ix the existing arrangement were allowed to lapse and we reopened the matter at our convenience in the winter. ‘ ' A fe-v months without money coming in, might, in view ol his greedy nature, make the Sheikh more tractable . Through the courtesy of Capt. Chauncy I telegraphed you as requested in your letter of the 14th instant and“also in reply to your telegram of the same date that the expiry date of the existing arrangement is the 6th August 1934. x ours sincerely, Lt.

Position however especially as regards activities of Hasa Oil concessionaires would not be saie^ua, ded if ? Saudi refusal to accept Slue Line as frontier were left without formal answer. Note to Saudi Government on lines indicated in my telegram ifo.QS \i seems therefore essential. f ' b. Unconditional Saudi recognition of Blue Line may not be ootained but proposed note should result either (1) in Saudi Government proposing discussion of possible modification of Blue Line frontier and thus recognising it tacitly if not explicitly as starting point of negotiations or (2) in further counter statement in latter case Saudi Government would have been made aware that His Majesty’s Government would regard any activities of Saudi authorities or Hasa Oil concessionaires beyond Blue Line as violation of i&gt;ontier while it would still be possible to avoid dis cussion at any rate until negotiations with Shaikh of ^atar are more advanced (see Bushire telegram No.5^2 to India Office). Second paragraph of your telegram. Relevant Ptoasea In Article 1 and Article VI of Treaty of 1916 / with Ibn Baud oth clearly implied that determination of / boundary should be by agreement and therefore did not commit / us/ x 'W f S, % | , k tM': ■, • I # W I’Vss'''us to abandon boundaries laid down in Anglo-Turkish f Convention which consequently can only b^modified by agreement. Third paragraph. Argument based on analogy of Kuwait settlement can similarly be answered if necessary by pointing to fact that settlement was by agreement. It would however be best if possible to avoid Igiving this reply at present in view of desire of not emphasising possibility of modification by agreement. If you think it important to meet point you may include with proposed note statement to the effect that cases of Kuwait and Blue Line frontier are not in view of Kis Majesty’s .ovemment parallel since/development*in Arabia since 1914 appear to His Majesty's Government to render Blue Line frontier inappropriate. Paragraph 4. You will see that His Majesty’s Government have no desire to expedite detailed discussions on this matter so long as their views are made clear and their right reserved nor do they wish at this stage to link question specifically to oil matters.

Will you send one man on your behalf and the Residency Agent will send one so that they may mane enquiries about this matter. Shaikh: I never gave permission for the tank to be placed there nor did l give a written undertaking accept ing onQ responsibility. The tank was placed there against my wall and 1 am not prepared to take part in the enquiries or send one on my behalf, i do not think that this was considered to be my property otherwise it would not have been intruded upon and my permission would have been taken first 0 and before the tank was placed. The tank was placed with the orders of the Political Agent, Bahrain, and it is for him to answer about this and not for nie to take steps or make enquiries, as a Ruler of the place you should make enquiries. Ao, li X am considered as Ruler of the ola,ce where is the written document for placing the tank there* X am not angry over the matter nor do 1 grumble or complain to txie people just like Shaikh Sultan bin Salim (Ruler of Has a 1 Khaimah). like to 1 do not/write to the Government and say that you P.A.

At the beginning the Shaikh appea was coming to settle up about a concession nd not to get an extension of the option. 3. The Shaikh refused to see %lles alone and Salih bin Mana*, Yusuf Kanoo, Hajji Williamson and Shaikh Hamad were present at the first interview. It was apparent that the Shaikh was not concerned with the clauses of any concession but was only concerned with tno a mount of money he would get. His final terms for a concession, which he maintained throughout, were, one and a half lakhs of rupees a year for four years and afterwards five lakns a year and royalty at 4 shillings, 51 shillings and pence C* w &amp;3 under the isipression timfc &amp; shilling End^rupeo He said that Chisholm had offered these terms but that they had been eventually refused by the Directors of the Company* Myilcs pomaea out wnai. Chisholm had agreed to no such terms and later on Salih bin Mena 1 admitted this, but sain that the Shaikh was under the impression fch&amp;t tiisse terms hsd. been given by Chisholffi# 4. It appears that there is such ill-feeling between Salih bln Mana* and Yusuf Kanoo and Bajji Williamson, amo at the beginning Salih appeared to do his best to make things difficult for Mylies. 5. Mylies asked for an extension and the Sha after a private discussion with Salih and Shaikh naoad became very angry and said that if at the end of the extension the Company did not come to an agreement then other companies interested would think that there was not oil In Qatar. 6. Kyiles managed to have several private talks with Salih, he thinks that Salih is quite untrust* ssjm that he would attempt to 1 e Company as Ion as it was worth his while, he had copies of the Bahrain, Persian, two ’Iraq and Has* concessions and also knew the exact details of the Kuwait concession. After h talk with him, ies was able to get-the Shaikh to agree to the terms noted above 7. lies is of the opinion that the Sha eventually agree to terms similar to those of the Kuwait concession but will not under any circumst be prepared to accept less. It also appears that the Shaikh does not appreciate the fact that he may refused permission to give a concession to any other company. 8. When Yusuf Kanoo visited Qatar in May to start negotiations without any authority from the Company, ihis'annoyed the Shaikh and it SO ms that Yusuf kanoo has not got the influence there that he would tressed on Mylies that he would rather conduct discussions witn a senior official of the us believe.

IN 1873 the Ottoman Government advanced a claim to sovereignty over the whole of the area that had at one time been in possession of the Imams of the Yemen, including tribal areas in South-West Arabia, with the rulers of which the British Government were in special treaty relations, ine .britisn Government, in reply, maintained that the rulers of these tribes were independent. There followed a period of frequent encroachments by Turkish authorities into the protectorate, of British representations and Turkis assurances, and of British measures to protect the tribes until, m 1901, the Government of India and the Ottoman Government both proposed that the frontier should be demarcated. In 1902 frontier commissioners met and carried out demarcation on the ground. The results were embodied m three protocols of 1903 1904 and 1905 respectively. Formal ratification was delayed untif 1914, the agreement arrived at in 1905 being completed and ratified m t e og o- Turkish Convention of the 9th March, 1914. The text will be found in C.P. 10517. Ratifications of this convention were exchanged at London on fLp Qy«p| TllTlG 1914 • 2 After the war, the Imam of the Yemen refused to recognise the frontier agreed upon in the 1914 convention and revived the predecessors. A situation similar to that m the last part of the 19tl \ ce a &gt; subsequently prevailed, until a treaty was concluded with the Imam at Sanaa on the 11th Februarv, 1934, which included a mutual undertaking providing for the maintenance of the situation in regard to the frontier as it existed on the date of signature of the treaty,( l ) and for the prevention of any violation of this frontier pending negotiations for its final settlement. These negotiations are to be initiated before the expiration of the present treaty which is to remain in force for forty years. This treaty has not yet been ratified. Persian Gulf Principalities. _ 3 In March 1911 the Ottoman Government formally intimated to Mm Majesty’s Government their wish that a precise definition might be reached as to the respective position of the two countries, commercia 7 aI l P. * - the Persian Gulf, His Majesty’s Government being concerned m Jiew of their special treaty relations with the Arab rulers on the Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf. The ensuing negotiations resulted m e sign of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913 (see C P L 1 ^ 5 nttoman convention, inter alia, recognised Koweit as an antonomous aza . , , Empire, and established its boundaries, and contained Turkish renuncmtion of rights in Qatar. The boundary of the Ottoman San j a o j delimited in detail, apart from where it marched with that of Koweit, but wa described generally in the convention as a line commencing a P , Persian Gulf a little to the south of Uqair, opposite the Isiand of Zakhnuniyah, running due south into the Ruba-al-Khali desert, until i me p , • i7 after which it turned and continued in a south-westerly d^ection m a straight line to meet Lakmat-esh-Shub, the most easterly point reached m the delimitation of the Aden Protectorate boundary.

This convention was not ratified, but, with the exclusion of Turkey from the Arabian peninsula, His Majesty’s Government have maintained that the frontiers of Turkey’s successors, Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen, should be confined within the limits of the former Ottoman Empire as defined in the conventions of 1913 and 1914. The question of the extent to which these conventions could be invoked was examined in 1928, in connexion with the concession of the Turkish (now Iraq) Petroleum Company. In a Library memorandum of the 24th January, 1928 [E 330/94/65], it is stated :— “ It may be objected that, as the convention of the 29th July, I 9 i 3 ) was never ratified, and that, as the ratifications of the convention of the 9 th March, 1914, were not exchanged until the 3rd June, 1914, neither of these documents can be invoked as evidence of the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire on the 19th March, 1914. “ An answer to that, so far as the Persian Gulf is concerned, would be that the negotiations of 1913 were instituted in order to provide for the maintenance of the territorial status quo and for the regularisation of a condition of affairs which had, in view of His Majesty’s Government, already existed for many years. “ The attitude of successive British Governments had been that, prior to Midhat Pasha’s expedition of 1871, there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction, effective or ineffective, south or east of Ojeir.C) There was nothing in the history of Muscat, of the Trucial Coast, of Bahrein, or of El Katr, which reflected Ottoman predominance. On the other hand. Great Britain had repudiated Turkish claims to sovereignty over Bahrein eighteen times, and had frequently informed the Porte that the Ottoman claim to sovereignty over El Katr could not be, and never had been, recognised by Great Britain. “ The answer as regards the Aden Convention would seem to be that, although it was not ratified until the 3rd June, 1914, an arrangement was made for its enforcement pending ratification. Apart from this, however, for many years the attitude of His Majesty’s Government had been that they did not acknowledge the title of the Porte to the country lying at or beyond the mouth of the Red Sea. ‘ ‘ As regards the Hadramaut, all the tribes had long been under British protection, and the leading sheikhs stipendiaries of the British Government. “ It is to be noted that, although Koweit was regarded by His Majesty’s Government as an autonomous Kaza of the Turkish Empire, the Sheikh of Koweit had undertaken to grant an oil concession in his territory only to a nominee of the British Government. Koweit may therefore for present purposes be regarded as outside Turkish territory.” 5. Since the war, with the exception of the frontier between Nejd and Koweit, which was defined in the Nejd-Koweit Agreement of the 2nd December, 1922, no definition has been reached in agreement with Ibn Saud of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Nejd. Library memorandum of the 17th October, 1927 [E 4330/104/65/1927], dealing with the frontier between Nejd and Qatar, contains the following paragraphs :— “ By article 11 of the (unratified) Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, the boundary between El Katr and Nejd was described as a line running from the extreme end of the gulf opposite the Island of Zakhnuniyah due south to Ruba-al-Khali (see blue line on map 2 attached to the convention of 1913). ‘' By article 6 of the treaty of the 26th December, 1915, between Great Britain and the Sultan of Nejd, the latter promised to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of El Katr. “ During a visit which Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner at Bagdad, paid to Ibn Saud in November-and December 1922, the question of the status of El Katr came under notice in connexion with a project for the grant of an oil concession for a tract of Nejd territory. Sir P. Cox, who found that in his discussions with the engineer representing the aspirant concessionnaires Ibn Saud had apparently included the Katr peninsula within the area for which he was prepared to negotiate a concession, at once took Ibn Saud to task, reminded him that he had nothing to do with That is south or east of the line dividing Nejd and El Katr. fl insi M fat latei 1911 Mew ifaby : Iki tk irieSl 1 ( %B( ’taller j ’taller 1 'taieli;El Katr except to respect it under the terms of the treaty of 1915, and insisted on the limitation of his discussions to the country west of the longitude of the head of Salwah Bay, i.e., the line laid down in the Anglo- Turkish Convention, 1913, and marked in blue on map 2 annexed thereto. “ As Ibn Saud accepted this injunction without argument and nothing later appears to have transpired, it may reasonably be held that the line of 1913 still constitutes the frontier between El Katr and Nejd.” f 6 . In February 1934 a despatch was received from His Majesty’s # ! | Ambassador at Angora [E 1206/1206/91/1934] reporting the receipt of a request from the United States Embassy for a copy of the “ Anglo-Turkish Treaty of the 29th July, 1913, which delimited the frontiers between Aden and the Ottoman dominions and between Muscat and the Ottoman dominions.” It was assumed in the Foreign Office that this request was connected with the operation of the Hasa Oil Concession by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, and it was held to be desirable that the position of His Majesty s Government with regard to the boundaries mentioned should be made clear to the United States Government, and that the United States Embassy at Angora should be put in possession of all the relevant treaty texts. After consultation with the India Office, a despatch was sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora on the 22nd March, 1934 [E 1839/1206/91/1934], instructing Sir P Lorame to com- municate a copy of the 1913 convention to the United States Embassy, and to show them a copy of the 1914 convention, which, unlike the 1913 convention, had been published. In this despatch the view was definitely taken that the fact that certain territories on the Ottoman side of the 1913-14 line had now become independent States, could not be regarded in the view of His Majesty s Govern ment as in any way affecting the status of the territories on the other side of that line which His Majesty’s Government regarded as forming the boundary between the Ottoman Succession State of Saudi Arabia and the territories of South- Eastern Arabia with which they were m special relations. Sir P. Lorame was instructed to call the attention of the United States Embassy to the fact that me 1913 convention was not ratified, but to point out to them, in support of the view taken by His Majesty’s Government of the validity of the line laid down therein, that that line was mentioned, adequately defined and definitely adopted m article 3 of the 1914 convention, which had been ratified. 7 One point arising out of the question of the 1913—14 frontier line is whether that line should be regarded as merely establishing the limits of Saudi Arabian territory or whether it also lays down the boundaries of the territories o, Arab rulers with whom His Majesty’s Government are in special treaty relations. After Mr Philby’s expedition into the Ruba-al-Khali in 1932, the Saudi Arabian paper, the Umm-al-Qura ,in publishing an account of the expedition, advanced a claim to Saudi Arabian sovereignty over the districts visited. The Foreign 0 then decided not to take the initiative m examining questions of territorial claims in the Ruba-al-Khali. The question of the territorial limits of Qatar has, how ever, arisen in connexion with the operation of the Hasa Oil Concession (see paragraph 6 above). Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson, Politica § en T , ow ^’, • was present with Sir Percy Cox at the Uqair negotiations with Ibn Saud m November and December of 1922 already referred to, has furnished a report 'E 279/279/91/19341 on the discussions which then took place regarding me Nejd-Qatar boundary. According to this report, Ibn Saud invx uced Hunter s map of Arabia 1 -inch to 32 miles, on which was marked m blue pencil the area which he proposed to grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate for con cession. This area included the whole of the Hasa Province and the Qatar peninsula, the south-western and southern boundary of the concession being marked by a line drawn down the Wadi Faruq as far as Jaw-ad^Dukhan and then turning east from there to Khor-adh Dhuwaihm on e coas . ^7 1 marked in red pencil on the map a line from Jaw-ad-Dukhan to Dohat Salwa, saying to Ibn Saud : “ That is the line,” and crossed out the incorrect line marked in blue. It will be noticed that the line marked by Sir P. Cox was not m accordance with that laid down in the 1913 convention. 77 a Ha t«i - 6 m- whether Sir P. Cox intended to indicate the frontier between Nejd and Qatar or whether he was merely warning Ibn Saud against assuming sovereignty eas o the red line on the map, and as Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson s report (written more than ten years after the event) contained nothing to show that mention was [81 gg— 2 ] B 2A. made of the 1913 convention line, it was considered desirable to consult Sir P. Cox on the subject. In a discussion held at the India Office on the 20 th February, 1934 [E 1302/279/91/1934], Sir P. Cox expressed his conviction that the 1913 con vention line was never mentioned during the 1922 discussions with Ibn Sand, and expressed the opinion that any view then expressed by him incidentally and extempore could not reasonably be regarded as an official pronouncement of the Hasa-Qatar boundary; he added that in any case he had informed Ibn Sand that His Majesty’s Government should be consulted before any concession was granted. 8 . No decision has yet been reached regarding the status of the territory immediately to the east of the 1913 convention line, but the despatch to Sir P. Loraine mentioned in paragraph 6 above contained a warning as to the position, and instructed him, should it be found necessary to give the United States Embassy any oral explanations on the matter, to avoid referring to this territory as specifically forming part of the State of Qatar itself, but to refer to it merely as being under British influence. 9. In a despatch of the 11 th April, Sir P. Loraine reported that he had spoken to the United States Ambassador on the 2nd April in the sense of the instructions summarised in paragraph 6 of this memorandum [E 2435/1206/91/ 1934], but that he had not found it necessary to refer to Qatar. The United States Embassy in London were also similarly informed on the 24th April of the position as regards the frontiers laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914, copies of which were sent to them [E 2481/279/91/1934]; here again no specific reference was made to Qatar, the phrase used being ‘ ‘ the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the British spheres of influence in South-Eastern Arabia.” This action was taken in order that the position might be made clear to the Standard Oil Company of California, who were carrying out aerial surveys which His Majesty’s Government feared might otherwise be extended over the frontier laid down in the convention of 1913. In addition, instructions were sent to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda on the 21st April [E 2481/279/91/1934] to address a formal note to the Saudi Arabian Government, informing them of the request of the United States Embassy at Angora, and of the action taken, enclosing copies of the conventions of 1913 and 1914, and explaining the view of His Majesty’s Government as to the validity of the frontiers laid down therein. This explana tion was to be on the lines laid down in the despatch to Sir P. Loraine summarised in paragraph 6 of this memorandum, Sir A. Eyan’s attention also being called to the position as regards Qatar. Sir A. Ryan addressed a note accordingly to the Saudi Arabian Government on the 28th April FE 2662/279/91/1934], In this note, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, he used the expression “for convenience of reference ’ ’ in communicating copies of the conventions of 1913 and 1914, in order to indicate the assumption that the Saudi Arabian Government already had knowledge of both. 10 .

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your signal No. yW- 9 dated 24th April, 1934, ana to forward herewith information which was gained during the air reconnaissance of the ; .AT A A Peninsular. 2. The reconnaissance was carried out by one* flight of No. 84 (3) Squadron (4 Wapitis) and 2 aircraft of No. 303 (FB) Squadron, ail of which operated from BAHREIN under the command of Group Captain R. K. Saul, P. F.C,, working in close touch with the Political Agent, BAHREIN, who accom panied the flying boat reconnaissance. 3. The reconnaissance was carried out on 9th Nay, 1934, and, in accordance with instructions from this Head quarters, the Wapitis flew from DOHA? AL HUS'IAIN via Fort RAlYAH to DOHA and thence via KARA SNA to SALTA. A report of tnia reconnaissance is attached as appendix ”A”. 4. The flying boats first reconnoitred DOHA? AS 3ALWA for a suitable alighting area and then crossed the peninsular from SALTA to ICHOR AL OLID ana reconnoitred the coast north to DOHA. A report of tnia reconnaissance is attached as appendix 'B''. 3. fne flying boats landed at DOHA where they were met by K.M. Sloops 'GlIORKHAM” and ’♦BIDEFOHD', and on the morning of May 10th Group Captain Saul accompanied the Political Agent, BAHREIN, and the Officer Commanding H.M. 8. 'BIDEFDRD' on a visit to the Shaikh of QATAR. Extracts from a report by Group Captain Saul, which were contained In a demi-official letter, are attached as Appendix ,, C ,, . 6. As a result of this reconnaissance it has been learned that a fairly satisfactory site for a landing 'ground exists near the Shaikh's palace at Fort RAIYAN, about 7 miles west of DOHA. As explained in appendix 'C' it was not /found The Secretary, Air Ministry, Adaatral House, Kingsway, London, T.C.3.found possible to marie out this site or for fapiiis to land tnere as had been hoped. From the aLr it appeared that sites for landing grounds existed near KAHA3NA and SAL’VA, but reconnaissance on the ground will be necessary to decide whether this is correct. As regards flying boats the foot of DOHA? A3 SALTA near SATAAi Tells is suite suitable for flying boats except when the '‘shamal’' (north wind) is blow ing, and in those circumstances flying boats could take re fuge in the southernmost bay of OJiZTJU HATAR. On the eastern coast of AVfAK the moil El ODAID is a good anchorage for flying boats. Photographs obtained during the recon naissance are attached in accordance with the list in appendix , 3. Very few bedouins were seen by either the Wapitis or the flying boats, ana the interior of iATAR appears to be very sparsely inhabited. 3 3!|| 4 1 jAT| I i I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant. f Air Vioe-Marahal, Coiauanding British Forces in 'Iraq. “lii\ 3 S 0 R E T 8. 1 From;- ho.81 (Bomber- Sq summer realde&amp;j |j Shaibah, being pumped u; i about a mile e To; - Air headquarters, British Forces in with grass; wai be ascertained I immediate vici: |j Date;- 14th May, 1934. was noted.

On 9.5.34 s.1434 carried out a reconnaissance of the West ern coast of DUHAT-AS-SALWA from JAZIRAT ZAKHUNIYAH to SALWA wells. The inlet near JAZIRAT ZAKHUNIYAH is approximately 10 miles in length and a mile wide, running north and south. It is completely sheltered from all winds and would make a good anchorage for flying boats. See photographs Nos. 1 &amp; 2. The coast line between JA2IRAT ZAXHUNIYAH and BUHAT HAMAR is flat and sandy with shoals and reefs some two to three hundred yards out to sea lying parallel to the coast. DUHAT HAMAR is an inlet approximately 1000 yards long by 400 yards wide. It is sheltered on all sides, but has extensive shoals which limit the area for the operation of flying boats. It is not considered that a flying boat would be able to taxi from DUHAT HAMAR into DUHAT-AS-SALWA to take off owing to the mouth of the inlet being extremely shallow and obstructed by sand banks. See photographs Nos. 3 &amp; 4. Between DUHAT HAMAR and SALWA there are three definite bays of which only one is shown on the Chart. None of these were suitable for flying boat anchorages. At SALWA there is a small inlet approximately 800 yards by 300 yards which is shallow and full of sand banks and is definitely unsuitable for flying boat use. (b) Eastern coast. On 9.5.34 s.1435 carried out a reconnaissance of the east ern coast of DUHAT-AS-SALWA from KHOR FAISHSHAKH to SALWA wells. The coast which appeared to differ considerably from the Chart was sketched and is shown on the attached tracing. No suitable alighting areas y/ere observed in the vicinity of DUHAT FAISHSHAKH, the water being extremely shallow with a large number of coral reefs. The southernmost bay of HA WAR ISLAND would possibly afford good shelter in emergency, though difficulty would be experienced in taking off or taxying to a suitable position for taking off owing to the shallow^ water, reefs, etc. See photographs Nos. 5 &amp; 6. At the foot of DUHAT-AS-SALWA, near SALWA wells, there is ample area of deep water, free from shoals and reefs for flying boats to operate on. The bottom is sandy with a few patches of coral, the rise and fall of tide is said to be about three feet. Tv/o anchorages, used by native boats during a Shamal, were visited but were considered unsuitable for flying boat use. 2. SALWA WELLS TO HOR-AL-' PDA ID,. One area approximately four miles south of SALWA WELLS was observed and it seems large andyflat^enough for a'-Landing Ground, though the ground appeared to be salty. No Bedu encampments were seen, though 30 - 40 camels were seen in a position 095° SALWA 12. A few camels were also seen grazing about 4 miles NNW. of KHOR-AL-' ODAID.REPORT ON HEgOTOAISGANGE OP QATAR (GOl^TD). SALWA WELLS TO HOR-AL-»©LAID. 2. For the first fifteen miles from SALWA WELLS to HOR »0DAID is of an undulating nature, partially rock and partially sand. The remaining distance to HOR-AL- ?

The western portion of this channel is about 6 feet deep in the centre, increasing in depth towards the seaward end. The rise and fall of tide does not appear to be more than three feet. There is a shallow bar in the Channel at the place marked X on the attached map. See photographs Nos. 11 &amp; 12. 4. ' HOR - AL - * ODAID TO DOHAH. The coast line varies slightly to that indicated on the Chart as is shown in attached tracing. The coast from HOR-al-'ODAID to about 2 miles south of WAKRAH is low lying and salty with sand dunes a short distance inland. From 2 miles south of WAKRAH to DOHAH the coast changes from sand dunes to 'Subkha' to undulating country with hard rocky foil. No suitable areas for Landing Ground were observed. No Bedu encampments were seen.APPENDIX ’*C'\ Extracts from D.O. letter from Group captain R.E. Saul D.P.C. to Air commodore A.D. Cunningham C.B.ii. (12/5/34). We left here on Tuesday to do the Qatar Reconnaissance, and on arrival at Bahrein I found that Loch had made arrangements to transfer from the flying boats to the 'Shoreham' at Odaid, and was very vague as to the air programme thereafter. I suggested to him that it would be much better for the two sloops 'Shoreham' and 'Bideford” tomeet us at Doha at Mid day on the 9th, where we could have a conference with shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim Ath Thani and his representatives and go into the matter of the landing ground at Riyan, to which Loch agreed. I sent a signal to this effect to the S.N.G. who also agreed and met us at Doha, in company with the 'Bideford'. Provided permission was given I intended to mark out the landing ground with some lime I had brought for the purpose, and for one of the Wapitis of 84 Squadron to carry out a trial landing. However, the Shaikh's son called on the S.N.O. on the afternoon of the 9th and apologised for the absence of his father, who, he said, was sick, and had gone out into the country to a place named Al Quhaib, which is some 35 miles N.N.W. of Doha. Loch expressed his concern about the shaikh's illness, and offered to take the ship's doctor to see him, but we were immediately assured that it was a minor illness and that he would be alright the following day. Having called this bluff, we then made arrangements to visit the Shaikh at Al Quhaib at 0600 hours on the morning of the 10th. Next morning the Shaikh sent two cars, one with escort, and colonel Loch, captain Browne of the 'Bideford' (as the S.N.O. had departed for Henjam the previous day) and myself proceeded to Al Quhaib via Riyan, passing the proposed landing ground en route. We found the Shaikh looking very healthy and fit, and after discussing everything bu the landing ground for some time. Loch eventually suggested the possibility of one of our aircraft landing at Riyan to test the landing ground. The Shaikh immediately became animated, and refused the request, having his reasons ready, stating that he did not want aircraft to land at Riyan, as there was no need for it and he feared an accident, for which he might be held responsible. Further, he said that when he had come to some agreement about the oil with the companies concerned, and with us for protection, he would be prepared to let aircraft land, but I gather that this should not be construed into a definite promise. After further discussion he did eventually, though some what reluctantly, agree to us examining the landing ground at Riyan on this way back to Doha. The general impression I got at the conference was that he expected tobe asked to allow our aircraft to land in his terri tory, as his reasons against came out pat, and obviously other influences had been brought to bear on him, and he was playing for% - 2 - # a Loch thinks that his attitude was definitely less strongly gainst the idea of the landing gfound than it was previously. a.in., we After an exceedingly heavy Arabic lunch at 8 started back to Doha, and half way back discovered we were being taken by a different track which missed the landing ground, whether the driver had instructions to do this is a matter of conjecture - we insisted on going back to the road we came by and eventually stopped and examined the landing ground site. The country in general consists of undulating stony desert, with occasional patches of thorn, but the site inspected is a long shallow depression in which water probably stand after rain. This has produced a mud seepage which has hardened, making a very good landing surface of hard mud, no crust, and will take all types of aircraft. It is about 600 yards long and 200 to 300 yards wide in places, with the prevailing wind up and down. There are a few jackal holes, and care should be taken to avoid them unless they have been previously filled in. The main Doha - Riyan track runs across the site, but is not an obstruction. I am inclined to think that the fact that the proposed site | for a landing ground is, so to speak, outside the Shaikh's front door, influenced him in his refusal, and if it were possible to obtain anothei^ite further away he might more readily agree. I kept a careful eye for any other likely site, but saw nothing. As I said, the general nature of the country is undulating stony desert, and it might be possible to select a site near Doha, where labour is available to clear the stones, but it would be a biggish job.'fo CONFIDENTIAL. f rtf l • 671-3 of 1934• The Hon ble the Political Resident in the Persian Itulf presents his goto pliments to and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned docu ment British Consulate-General, BUSHIRE Dated 16tti July im* Reference to previous correspondence : • political Resident's letter !fo.694-u oj. i rioted To(2) t (3) iolitital (4). * ROe Name and Date.

(1900/412/114). British Legation, Jedda. 27th June 1934. Sir, ter, With reference to my telegram No. 149 of the 23rd June I have the honour to enclose a translation of the note and memorandum addressed to me by the Saudi Government on the 20th June regarding the eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. Although this translation has been made with great care, I consider it advisable, in view of the unusual importance of the note, to send you copies of the original Arabic texts. I may say that Fuad Bey Hamza was good enough to read the translation in the form it assumed after my conversation with him on the 22nd June, on the distinct understanding that he was not thereby making himself responsible for the English text, and. had only two alterations to suggest when we met again next day. The first was purely verbal. The second related to the adjective before 'frontier line' in the last phrase of paragraph 2 of the note. He suggested that it might be rendered 'existing' or 'de facto' but I think that the sense he was aiming at fc is better expressed by 'actual' 2. My conversation with Fuad Bey on the 22nd June was long and detailed. I must not attempt to reproduce the whole of what passed but will give the gist in the follow ing paragraphs. 3. I suggested to Fuad that, while the second sentence of paragraph 2 of his note professed to be based on a principle/ -he Right Honourable Sir John Simon, GCSI.,KC¥0., etc», etc., 0 tc«- 2 - principle which-His Majesty’s Government had stated, the principle on which he relied was different or rather more comprehensive. His Majesty’s Government considered that an agreed frontie^r existed and has said that this could not he altered without a further agreement between the parties and/or their successors in t.itle. The Saudi Government held that no valid agreement existed and that a new agreement was necessary. I did not question their right to assent this view but I dk did not wish to let pass what looked like a distortion of the language used by me under your instructions. Fuad Bey’s first reaction showed that he thought I was trying to entrap him in some way. afterwards seemed to see^ point and I did not pursue the matter, as it was only import.ant to make my first point clear . 4. As you will have seen from my telegram under reference, I attached more importance to the use of the plural ! 'Govern- ments concerned' in the same sentence. I did not state very explicit^ to Fuad Bey what was in my mind, namely that the word might refer to the Government of ^atar and the Trucial Shaikhdoms. to the exclusion oi His Majesty’s Government, but I said enough to elicit Trom Fuad Bey an assurance that the plural was used merely for the purpose of a statement of principles governing the position of the Saudi Government ids a vis other Govern ments generally. 5 . I drew Fuad Bey's attention to the words 'whatever may have then been the real position of the British Government' in paragraph 1 of his memorandum. I a sked whether they were meant to throw doubt on the loous..staoui in/ 'to.7./ in 1913-14 of His Majesty's Government, who had an historic position in regard to that port of Arabia. Fuad Bey took refuge in the following phrase ? 'regarding which we do not wish to enter into discussion now'. I suggested that, if the Saudi Government were reserving the right to call the position { of His Majesty's Government in question, they would do well j to take their courage in both hands and do it forthwith. My object in this was to emphasise the doctrine that His Majesty's Government have a sphere of influence in Eastern Arabia, in which they claim historical and legal rights. 6. Fuad Bey was shocked to find a slip in the penultimate sentence of paragraph 1 of his memorandum, where the European equivalent of the date of Ibn Sa'ud's occupation of Hasa had made a treaty with the Turks whereby he recognised Ottoman sovereignty and accepted the position oj. a iurkish provmcj.al governor. I suggested, expressly as from myself, tnat ct might interest His Majesty's Government to see a copy of this document. Fuad Bey intimated vaguely that this might oe arranged but said that the treaty had never been ratified it and added spontaneously that there had been a secret f irman of which he himself had never been able to get huld I have no clear reoollection of what information regari arrangements was received from Turkish sources au the but you will doubtless consult the records of the pen / been given as the 13th April, 1911. Uponhis correcting this year to 1913, I asked whether Ibn Sa'ud had not shortly after or come into force. He did not question my description of in view of the Saudi Government's definite contention Ibn Sa'ud re-e Ibn Sa'ud re-established a legitimate sovereignty over Hasa over three months before the signature of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 and thereafter retained it. over three7. I was not clear asst to whether the Anglo-Saudi Treaty of the 16th December 1916 was concluded in English or had been signed, but said that there was certainly a signed Arabic text. Such records as I possess tend to confirm this and lead me to suppose that it was the only version. I have therefore caused the Aranic text of the part of Article 1 wki which Fuad Bey quotes in paragraph 2 of his memorandum to be translated from the Arabic. The version does not differ materially from thej^tg English translation usually used but the Arabic word rendered 'dependencies” in the latter implies j perhaps rather more in the way of geographical continuation and the word rendered 'territories' represents the ordinaAy Arabic word for boundaries. Fuad Bey attached importance to the word corresponding to 'categorically' in the enclosed version, which does not appear in the usual English Aranic. Fuad Bey was not certain whether an English text translation. 8. I had some difficulty in understanding paragraph 3 of Fuad Be^'s memorandum. His oral explanation made it clear that the first two sentences contrasted two distinct things via. the limits of the sovereignty of the Shaikh of ^atar as 'known among the Arab tribes', i.e. a traditional boundary between the places of settled habitation like Doha and their immediate surround and the unsettled portions of and their the peninsula; and a de_faeto boundary between the 'Hajrat 1 or stony portion of the peninsula as a whole and the sandy desert stretching up to the south of the peninsula. His de facto boundary between the 'Hajrat ' desert stretching up references to Karaana suggested that he supposed it to lie on this de facto boundary and to be further south than its on this d.6 i 9 .cto Doun position in the maps, map showing it and I We had not before us, however, any it and I bid not wish to press Fuad Bey as his/ to-5- his precise conception of the 'boundary. It is a possible surmise that the secret understanding which is supposed to exist between the Shaikh of Qatar and Ibn Salud establishes a cie facto boundary running from near Salwa to Karaana and beyond. Fuad bey admitted that the words in the third sentence of this paragraph* which read 'alteration of the known frontier or even the existing one' would be more logical if he had said'...of the existing frontier or even the known one'. 9. I have elaborated the points in the preceding paragraph becuase it was clear to me that Ibn Sa'ud attaches rather special importance to the retention of Salwa and such Ikhwan settlements as exist in the neighbouring country to the east and south-east. 10 * I was not clear as to whether the words Amirs in the last sentence of the memorandum referred to the Trucial Shaikhs or to local personages who accepted Saudi sovereignty. Fuad Bey said that it referred to the Shaikhs of the various principalities on the coast. The thread running through all his argument, though it was not revealed in any express language and he did not contest my repeated use of the words 'British sphere of influence', was that the territories of Ibn Sa'ud ard of the coastal rulers must necessarily be conterminous. I suggested, though in a lighter vein, that it might be interesting to know whether on account had been kept of Zakat levied beyond the blue line, with a view to a elaim for reimbursement. 11. I need add little to what I have said in my telegram under reference regarding two other important points in the conversation, namely Fuad Bey's complaints that His hajesty's Government/? - 6 ~ Government had not referred to the blue line in 1915 or in 1927 and his personal suggestion for a compromise. I confess that I myself have some difficulty in dismissing as negligible the Saudi argument from the Treaty of 1915(which has been un comfortably present in my mind since I sent you my telegram No. 40 of the 21st March) when taken in conjunction with known facts regarding the extension of the rule of Ibn Sa'ud’s '’fathers' in their heyday and the fact that his new influence has extended 1 far to the east of the Blue line. I am not even now sure as to the situation of fact in regard to Baraimi, a point to which I adverted in my telegram No.47 of the 30th March. 12. I will not overload this despatch by discussing the alleged analogy between the Kuwait settlement of 1922 and the sort of settlement now suggested by the Saudi Government. Fuad Bey did not revert to this subject on the 20th June* but I still think that the argument used by the Saudi Government will in due course call for a more elaborate refutation than that outlined in your telegram No. 116 of the 13th June. 13. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosures to His Excellency the Viceroy of India ? Foreign and Political Department, Simla, and to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to be with the highest respectTransla+vion Ministry of Foreign Affairs y///. TAIF. 8th RaM ’ Al Awwal. 1353. (20th June 1934). Your Excellency, After Compliments I have the honour to acjalowledge receipt of Your Excellency's note No.90( 177€/412/108) of the 3rd Rabi'Al Awwal 1353 (15th June) regarding the view of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom on the contants of my previous note to Your Excellency about the true position of and certain neighbouring Arab territories in eastern and southern Arabia. contained in your note under reference and their attention has been especially drawn to your mention of your Govern ment's point of view in regard to the legal aspect of the &lt; case. As regards this point, I regret that I am obliged to state that the Government of His Majesty adhere to the principle which you referred to in your note, namely that any frontier agreement must be fully agreed upon between them and the Governments concerned, and cannot admit that any frontier line cun be laid down oy one party. They therefore affirm their insistence upon their position, which I have already explained to Your Excellency in m^* nooe of the 29th Muharram 1353 (May x3th) Ho .101/5, namely that j they do not regard the line you referred to as correctly describing the true -fontier line, from the points of view of | fact and law,between them and the neighbour ing Arab the frontier line between certain of His Majesty's dominions The Government of His Majesty have studied what is territories! H.E.the Envoy Extraordinary andand declare their entire readiness to (come to a)ijaatai mutual understanding, in all good faith and sincerity, in respect of the actual frontier line, which shall secure the interest and the advantage of all the Arab countries concerned. And, desiring to explain all the reasons on which the Government of His Majesty base their attitude, 1 forward to you with this my note a statement which I hope will be of use during the sscfcat study of the position. With highest respects, (signed) Fuad Hamza.Statement of the Present Position of the Frontiers between the Saudi Kingdom and the Neighbouring Arab Territories to the East and South. !• The Government of His Majesty, for reasons which are in their view of substantial importance, cannot admit that the frontier line called 'the blue line', which was specified in the Anglo--Turkish Convention of 1913 and confirmed in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914, was agreed upon between Governments having proper authority and a true locus standi whatever may have then been the real position of the British Government - regarding which we do not wish to enter into discussion now; for the position of the Ottoman Government at that time was clear and evident, in that they did not possess the right to determine the destiny of the countries which had concluded agreements in this respect with the British Government; for it is clear and evident that the authority of the Ottoman Government over the territories under discussion, while it did not extend beyond the inhabited towns and villages and was not exercised outside them, ceased in xact as soon as His Majesty the King recovered the territories of his ancestors and established his legal authority in tnem, by occupying al-Hasa on the 5th Jumad al Ula 1331 (corresponding to the 13th April 1913). Every agreement made by the Ottoman Government in respect of these territories after the above mentioned date is void, as emanating from a Government having no concern with them. 2. Article 1 of the Treaty concluded between His Majesty the King and the British Government on the 18th Safar 1334 ^corresponding to the 16th Becemoer 191*5) states as follows: 'The/•* 'The great British Government categorically recognise and acknowledge that SFejd and Hasa and Qatif and Jubaii ? and their vicinities and boundaries (or limits) which shall subsequently be discussed and determined and their ports on the shores ofthe Persian Gulf, belong to (lit.'are of') anssstHK the dominions of Ibn Sa'ud and to the dominions of his ancestors who came before him. They hereby recognise (lit.'describe') the said Ibn Sa'ud as an independent ruler fever the above-mentioned dominions and absolute Chiet of their tribes,etc.' From perusal of this Article the following facts are clear: (a) The actual frontier line was not definitely laid down but it was agreed that it should subsequently be fixed. (b ) The British Government acknowledged (the right of) His Majesty the King to the dominions of his ancestors. (c) They also acknowledged his right to all the trioes belonging to those dominions. (d) Their agreement to the 'Uqayr Protocol, in w^T-h vas laid down as the frontier between Nejd and Kuwait a line other th.n that defined in the anglo-Turkish Convention, thereby recognised the inappropriateness of that line to serve as a true and acceptable basis for the frontiers between His Majesty's dominions and the other neighbouring countries. 3. It is known among the Arab tribes that the confines (frontiers^ of Qatar are the confines (frontiers) of the inhabited towns and villages, and that at those points the confines (frontiers) of the countries generally known to form part of His Majesty’s dominions end. In the case of the/~3« the existing limits (same word) between His Majesty’s dominions and Qatar, these end in the Hajrat of Qatar. The Government of Kis Majesty only contemplate an alteration of the known frontier, or even the existing one, by means of a straightforward (lit.chaste) agreement which they wish for and would welcome by opening the door for its attainment. 4. All the tribes living between the coastal towns of Qatar and the coast of Oman and the Hadhremaut belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom, are entirely submissive to the laws of the country, pay Zakat, and are obedient to the calls of the Government in the time of war(ijhad) etc. This situation of fact and the authority of the Government of His Majesty the King over them meet with no opposition at any time on the part of the Amirs oi those coasts $ they (the Government) have considered, and still consider, that this is one of the rights of His Majesty, to which there can be no opposition. 8th abi 'al Awwal 1353. -v* (20th June 1934).1 ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO BE ABBRZSSE13 TO THE COMPANY | I j CL.S j** ijGLC-PEESIAN OIL COMPANY, LIMITED.

Mr. Hearn rang up on the 15th July to say that Mr. My lies had secured the consent of the sheikh of Qatar to an extension of the present option for a further period o-f 8 months at a rent of Rs.2,500 per month, ihe A»P*0#G. regarded this as very satisfactory. They had, however, no information as to whether the Sheikh had given any indication in the course of the discussions of his attitude on the question of a concession, hut they would let us have a copy of Mr* Malles' report when received. 2. Mi*. Hearn went on to say that the Company would probably ask for a meeting with us in the near future to discuss future procedure. For various reasons it would be some time before they could resume active negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar for the grant of a concession. — They propose, however, to suggest to H.M.G. that the political points involved in the grant of any concession should in the near future be cleared out of the way by discussion between the political authorities in the Persian Gulf and the sheikh. Once these had been disposed of it would be possible for the Company to take up negotiations on the basis of the commercial issues only. J.G. LAITHWAITE.

The following information was obtained from Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifah and *Ali bin Ahmad al Ghatam:- w S ah ale is at a distance of about three quarters ' ' of an hour from Salwali. Date trees are grown at ' ” Sakak which are irrigated from spring water. There ' ' are very^few houses of mud in which four or five ' “ families live, but there are no huts. They live in ” ' them during the summer time and when the winter is ” M up they go to the interior to graze their cattles. ' ' Hamad and *Ali al Yabir(Jabir) of the Al Murrah ' ' live with their family at Sakak. They are now were ' Sakak on active service in Yaman vhere they/sent M by Bin Sa’ud on the ground that they are from Yam ' race and should help the Yam who are in Naj ran. ' Hamd is said to have come to Hasa and I (Shaikh ' Salman) am sure that when they return to Sakak they ff II t! II II fl ' will come to Bahrain. Ambak is situated on the South” ' West of Sakak at a distance of about six hours(or ' ' 24 miles). As one approaches Ambak he sees five ” ' mountains,which look like the five fingers of a ” a ' hand when it is open, and the village is at/little ' ' distance from the bottom of the mountain. There are” ' some ancient buildings in the mountains. The present' ' village consists of about five houses of mud with ” ” few palm trees which are watered from springs, lio ” ” one lives at Ambak during the winter but in the ' ' summer few people go there on account of the water ” ' (By Shaikh Salman) At the time of the old Sa’ud ” 'rule one of their men, probably, Saiyid Zawawi, tried” ' to dig a channel from Salwah to Khaur al ’Udaid in ' ' order to separate Qatar from the main-iand,but on ' ' account of fights with Qatar people and others, the ' woik on uij.e ciicinnej. v/as abandoned.

What papers do Qatar dhows have ? / (a) for Bahrain or Dibai (bj for India, Persia, ’Iraq etc., i- ' ♦ /i • wmw— uinw&gt;LiuiWx.: r ^ 1. People coming from Qatar are given a permit by the hudirs of Customs either at Doha or at Wakrah. The attached is the form used by the respective Mudirs. A fee of one rupee is charged for every person entered in the permit. Persons holding Qatar permits.for Bahrain are allowed to return on the sa °y paying eight annas to the Bahrain authorities for exit visa. 2. When a Qatari intends to go to India or any other outside country a certificate of identity is issued to him in lieu of the Qatar permit. 3. Qatar boats do not have regular ’Kol’(boat certificate), but a certificate, which serves as a manifest a,s well, is usually given by the Jkudir of Customs in which it is stated that ' The bearer owner of is a Qatar subject who is leaving for with of cargo for '. Qatar people have no boats that can go to India and very few cargo boats,that ply between Qatar and other portSjare owned by the Qatar people. J ■ 1 f 13.6.54 What happens when a Qatari enters Bahrain ? Is any endorsement made on his permit ? Do all Qataris get these permits from the Mudirs or do some come without ? B© Do we see the permits unless a certificate of identity MacMsr / is pequired ? H.M. 13. 6. 343BBB - 2 - P. A. Wlien a Qatari enters Bahrain his travel permit is checked and sealed by the Bahrain Passport Officer before he is allowed to land. No endorsement is made on the permit, besici.es the seal of the Passport Office, but when he wants to return from Bahrain to Qatar the words ’Permitted to return’ are made on his jJex’mit for which he has to pay eight annas to the Bahrain Passport jj authorities. As a rule,all Qatar subjects should be in possession of travel permits when they come to Bahrain which should be signed by the Ludir of Customs, but few person^,sometimes,come to Bahrain without such permits, but they are either sailors or Tawashis. When a man from Qatar applies for a certificate of identity he brings his permit with him to establish his identity, but persons who have no permits are granted certificate of identity from the Agency when they bring a letter of introduction from a known oerson in Bahrain. 13.6.34mi P.A. If tlie following steps ci-re- taicen against i^atar suOject it might bring pressure to bear on the Shaildi:- la All Qatar subjects who intend to return to their country should be made to have an endorsement from the Agency* ^* lo facilities should be afforded by the Customs or % other Government offices in Bahrain to Qataris and in particular ito members of A1 Than! and other notables | To discourage, indirectly, Bahrain subjects from giving advances to Qatar subjects Press Qatar subjects for the payment of debts due to Bahrain people whenever a case is brought against them To indirectly instigate Bahrain people to claim their I* money from Qataris. 3* 4 * 6 * 13.6.34 To ash the Residency .agent not to grant any Certificate applies oi Identity to a Qatari should lie apply to him for one This would of course compel Qatar subjects to come to Bahrain. t2. / The question of bringing indirect pressure to bear on Shaikh T Abdullah bin Qasim of Qatar has been discussed by the Political Hesident and the Political Agent. The principle is that it is desired to impress upon him that Bin Sa'ud is not the only power which can cause him inconvenience or worse. It is possible that such pressure may merely stiffen his and attitude, as he is an old/obstinate man, but on the balance it seems more likely to do good, as bringing home to him the extent to which he depends on His Majesty T s Government’s good will towards him. Eajji Yusuf Kanoo will, in the course of talk with ^ataris explain to them that Shaikh ’Abdullah bin H asim is precluded from giving the Oil Concession to another company (this is not* strictly correct) and that only his obstinacy is standing between his Family and people and the pecuniary and other benefits of granting the oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited. 3. It is desired to influence the people of ^atar, so that may they/in their turn influence the Shaikh. To this end yitaris coming to Bahrain are to be asked about the discontent, which is understood to be rife in Qatar, at Shaikh ’Abdullah refusing to grant the concession and so keeping money out of the poor people’s pockets and also out of the pockets of his family. Head Munshi is arranging to do this. 4. It will be seen whether it is possible to get a suitable man to spread similar doubts in ^atar itself. 5. Arrangements (see separate note) have been made for the Passport Officer, Bahrain, to send all permits of Qatar subjects to the Agency for stamping before they are allowed to land. A telegram has been sent to the Residency Agent directing him not to grant certificates of identity to .atar subjects, and, if they apply for them, to tell them that they must apply to the Political Agent, Bahrain.5. It was decided that no certificates of identity should oe issued ior the present ■(tm-l «yni n n T1 npr.^ .; c . | t •-.nr.^o j, Note below should be issued to Passport Clerk (Indian Assistant and Head Clerk tc see). 7. The principle is not to derange normal life more than can be helped provided that it is brought home to Shaikh ’Abdullah that we have the power of holding up practically all movements of his subjects. tj 14th June 1934No visas or certificates of identity should be granted to Qatar subjects without orders of the Political Agent or Assistant Political Agent. 2. Passport Officer, Bahrain, will send all permits of ^atar $ subjects to be rubber stamped by the Agency before they are allowed to land. ^ 16th June 1934. Indian Assistant. Head Clerk.
