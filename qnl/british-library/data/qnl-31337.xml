My telegram No. 118. I have just seen Nuri Pasha who spent from eleven a.m. yesterday to 5 a.m. this morning wrestling with the Regent. He gave the following account. 2. Largely owing to panic by his mother and sisters the Regent^began to lose' his nerve by noon and Arshad (personalities Do. 36) and Sadr (personalities No. 83) who were present maintained that only Saleh Jabr*s resig- ' nation would bring an end to the rioting. Nuri Pasha pleaded tlr.t Saleh Jabr had only just been given full powers. If he was allowed to carry on for^another twonty-four hours all 'would be well. Several times he almost persuaded the Regent but his fears always overcame him. • 3. Nuri Pasha then begged that at least Saleh Jabr be heard. He was summoned and saw the Regent alone. According to Saleh Jabr the Regent burst into tears and went completely to pieces c He begged Saleh Jabr to resign and the latter did so. He could have done nothing else. 4. Discussion then started about successor. Nuri Pasha pressed hard for Tawfiq Suwadi but was over ruled. Saar refused but Arshad accepted. Nuri Pasha induced Umar Nadhmi (personalities No. 129) and Mohammed Hassan Kuba (personalities No. 78) to'accept though they were reluctant tc serve under Arshad. Others now being approached are Ali Mumtaz (No. 32) Abdulillah Hafidh (No. 10) Najib A1 Rawi (No. 93), Abdul Jabber Chalabi (No. 11), Sadiq A1 Bassam (No. 108). Latuer is unlikely tc accept. Shakir U1 Wadi is reserved for_defence. One or two others are also being approached. any case probable that seme sort of Government will be formed by .arshad, pledged to restore order and then resign, leaving the treaty on the shelf for the moment. Nun Pasha thought that Parliament might be prorogued for two months. o. Nuri Pasha stressed the obvious fact that those whe have been agitating against Saleh Jabr were not working tc put notorious reactionary like Arshad into premiership. He thought there might be Calm for a day or two but then more trouble.would occur. Arshad would no doubt be able tc deal with it but not better then Saleh Jabr. For uhe mcnent we could only wait and sea what would happen. /6. I said- 2 - , J . 6 j, I said o1 ’ course you ¥/ould be most concerned about the treaty. Nuri Pasha said he was desperately sorry but it must be shelved for the moment. He begred me to believe, which I do entirely, that he had struggled to the limit of his powers. He was heartily ashamed of the deplorable scene at the palace and sent personal apologies to you. No one not present could have any idea of what it had been like, though I myself have no diffi culty in visualising it. 7. By arrangement with Nuri Pasha I had been standing by ready to see the Regent at any moment considered useful, out Nuri Pasha said this morning that my intervention would not have helped. The Regent was too far gone and other Iraqis present would have resented interference by the Embassy. 8. At no stage were dissident persons present at iatal meeting on January 20th called to the Palace so they too will be as disgruntled as ever. 9, Team suggested for Arshad is so ill-a'ssorted that it is difficult to see that it will be able to stand together or accomplish much. I fear however that any intervention by us would be most unwise at this juncture.• m particular Nuri Pasha said that he thought it would be most undesirable for me to see the Regent ?or the moment. Only advantage of a new Government is that it should give time for the Regent to get his nerve back and for us zo 4 .^iV wor ^ on P e ^ s onal contacts. You will appreciate that the latter have been almost impossible as rioting.has rendered movement in the town extremely difficult ana even dangerous. At the moment the town is quieter but there is still some shooting.

The Joint Defence Board has been attacked ..because it, may involve Iraq in wars which would not otherwise be o/f any concern to her. On the contrary, the Joint .Defence Board is a new development of great political and practical advantage to Iraq. It is composed of equal numbers of British and Iraqi representatives and clearly „ no decision can be taken by it without the consent ofboth parties. One of its functions is to formulate agreed plans in the strategic interests common to both countries. If Iraq claims that there is no Iraqi interest in a certain region or plan, then clearly the Joint Defence Board will not concern itself with that region or plan. Another of the Joint Defence Board’s functions is the co-ordination of measures to enable either high contracting party to come to the aid of the other as a measure of collective self- defence if the other becomes engaged in war. Clearly, here again, the Iraqi Government have an equal share m the decision on the manner in which these measures should be co-ordinated* Iraq is in no way committed to send forces abroad to take part in wars which do not concern her. 3. It has also been suggested that this Treaty gives Britain greater facilities than at present and in particular gives facilities at .airfields, other thaii -fiabbaniya ard GJiaiba. In fact tne only d'efinite facilities provided for in the Treaty are those at Habbaniya and Shaiba, 4. It has also been suggested that Iraq will now have to pay for the cost' of Habbaniya and Shaiba. This is tnlaliy untrue. The only expenses Iraq will -have to pay .will be those of the guards at these airfields and the construction and maintenance of buildings required exclu sively for the use of the Iraqi forces. 5. The treaty was not rushed through in a few. days ^.n London. The London negotiations represent the closing period of a process which had been going on since May, 1947. g ' 6. Iraq may be attacked for making a Treaty incon sistent with tne Arab League Covenant. There is an express reservation on this point, whereby Iraq’s position is, entirely covered. / * * I-* \ Txi^Bue-no s-Mres Only: Please pass to Mont evict eo .4 y ^ \ PTo Nanking only: Please*“pas 7 S,,to„Sharigh.aL--(Embassy). ] [To Rome^onlyr 'Please pass to Holy See.] ['&amp;Cs ingapore only: Please pass to Saigon.]cjirx r IrZ&amp;l'-j ^ This Is an unparaphrased version of a Secret cypher (ypex) message and the text must first be paraphrased if it is essential to communicate it to persons outside British and United States Government Services.

His arrival greatly cheered the Regent. it was agreed that first step must be to re-establish law and order after which Treaty would be discussed in Majlis in a constitutional manner. H.M.Charge cVAffaires later supported this course with Regent. 2* Saleh Jabr broadcast two appeals for calm on 26th and 27 th January saying that Government wished to restore order so that Treaty could be properly considered by whole country. There was, however, considerable rioting in Bagdad on 27 th January and H.M.Charge d f Affaires was informed that it was urged on Regent that only resignation of Saleh Jabr would stop rioting. Accordingly on 26th January Regent asked Saleh Jabr to resign. 3» Discussion then started as to successor and after considerable manoeuvring Mohammed Sadr a former President of Senate succeeded in forming Government on 29 th January. 10 out 01 the 14 members 01 his Government are known to have been opposed to Treaty of Alliance and these include leaders of extreme /Nationalist2 i Nationalist(Independence) Party. These elements are believed to have been largely responsible for recent riots and it would therefore seem that order is likely to be restored. COPIES TO: Mr . Cost ley-White, C.R.O. (/.)

Disturbances in Bagdad resulting from announcement of signature of lieu Treaty of Alliance l^d Regent to call meeting on 21st January of prominent political personalities including Acting Prime Minister. After meeting, communique was issued stating that:— It was unanimously agreed that Treaty does not realize the aspirations of the country and was not a good instrument to consolidate the pillars of friendship between the two countries, especially as the Council of Ministers has not yet decided to approve the Treaty in question. Therefore Regent promises Iraqi people that no treaty whatever not ensuring rights of country and its national aspirations will be ratified. 2. On 22nd January Regent told His Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires, Bagdad, that he had not called meeting to discuss merits of treaty but to ask advice and assistance of those present in dealing with disturbances. After Acting irime Minister had described situation in Bagdad, others attacked treaty and prasent Government. Meeting decided that only announcement by Regent in sense of that issued would calm resentment. Except for Acting Prime Minister, other^Ministers remained silent and Regent confirmed to Charge d’Affaires that word ’’unanimously” in communique did not include them.

Neither he nor Iraqi I rime Minister would have set their signatures to any document which ignored aspirations of people of Iraq. 5. Charge d'affaires, Bagdad, has been instructed to give Regent message in sense of Mr. Devin's remarks in House of Commons. In communicating this message he is to indicate to Regent that those who are opposing treaty in Iraq have never been friends either of Royal House or of Iraq or of United Kingdom. 6.

Informal and secret discussions have been held in Baghdad to. i examine possibility of revision of 1930 Treaty of Alliance with Iraq. Memorandum covering: these discussions together with preliminary United Kingdom draft for revised Treaty of Alliance with Annexure are &gt; being sent by despatch. Articles 3 and 4 of draft treaty stand as f o 11 ov/s: - Be gins. ARTICLE 3* Should either High Contracting Party become engaged in war, the other High Contracting Party will, subject always to the provisions of Article 4 of the present Treaty, innediately come to his aid as a measure of collective defence. In the event of an imminent menace of hostilities the High Contracting Parties will immediately concert together the necessary measures of defence. The assistance afforded by His Majesty the King of Iraq in either circumstance will include the facilities referred to in die Annexure to this Treaty# ARTICLE 4* Nothing in the present Treaty is intended to or shall in any way prejudice the rights and obligations which devolve, or mey devolve, upan either of the High Contracting Parties under the Charter of the United Nations or / • under any other international agreements, conventions or treaties. Ends; 2# During these discussions in Bagdad United Kingdom negotiators have had four main objectives:- \ (a) /wr ■ r v ^ v- 9 (a) right to maintain bases of Habbini^h and Shaibah with British personnel in a state of complete efficiency; (b) right to station operational units at these bases in peace time; (c) right to free passage of aircraft in transit at any time; (d) right t ' movement of United Kingdom Forces across Iraq in case of need. It was also clearly undr rot cod on United Kingdom side that (e) no Treaty was of any value unless it was of such a nature , that it would endure and that it would form basis of a structure which could later embrace whole of Middle East. 3# Position now reached in discussions is that, subject to some . qualifications United Kingdom negotiators have attained points (a), (c) and (d) in paragraph 2 above, but in the case of point (b) it has proved impossible to move Iraqi Prime Minister from his decision that presence of operational units in peace time must be at option of King of Iraq and he insists on 'may invite' as key phrase. Although it has not proved'possible as yet to reach agreement on tliis important issue, we consider that stage has been reached fr m which it should be possible to make rapid progress towards final agreement* We are still hopeful that it may be .possible to persuade Iraqi Prime Minister to accept our proposals regarding; stationing of units at air bases. We have, however, considered what compromise proposals might be made, if necessary, and are considering alternative proposals on following lines: for inclusion in Annexure# ' Either (a) Begins. ■ In order that His 1 ritannic Majesty nay be in a position to carry out his obligations under Article 3 of Treaty His Majesty the ’ ing of r Iraq grants free access to the air bases of Habbaniyah and Shaibah to aircraft and operational units f His Britannic Majesty* It is agreed th at /-3- si) that the visit of operational ‘units of Wie Air Forces of His Britannic Majesty to the ba^es shall be of a ternporary character except on the invitation of the King of Iraq* The Joint Defence Board to be set up m accordance with the provisions :'f this Annexure will review tSae position fr jir time to time in tye light of the c ire instances prevailing and will submit recommendations to High Contracting Parties.

In ~rder that His Britannic Majesty may be in a position to carry out his obligations under Article 3 of the Treaty His Majesty the King of Iraq may invite .His Britannic Majesty to station aircraft and operational units of the R.a.F. at the air bases. The Question whether any adjustment is required in the utilisation of the bases by these units will be reviewed from time to. time in the light of the circumstances then prevailing by the Joint Defence ‘Board, to be set up in accordance with the provisions of this annexure. The Board vail submit the recommendations to the High Contracting Parties. Ends. In addition obtain from Iraqi Government a letter, which could if 1 necessary be secret, to be signed at same time as Treaty, embodying invitation to His Majesty’s Government to maintain necessary aircraft and operational units of R.A.P. at air bases. 5* His Majesty’s Charge d T Affaires, Bagdad, has reported that in consequence of developments in Palestine we have only a very brief period during which we can hope to secure our objectives* He has therefore been authorised to invite Iraqi Prime Minister to London for discussions at an early date, 6. We are anxious not to give impression that invitation signifies any modification in our attitutde and invitation is to be accompanied by explanation on f ollowing lines:- Begins. We are naturally disappointed that it has not been possible to reach agreement on one essential issue, namely, facilities to be given to R. A.

This would he new and durable foundation for close relations of friendship, alliance and co-operation which exist between the two countries and would also be the first step in a defensive organisation embracing each of Arab countries which would ensure security of Middle East.

In this connexion, we should be grateful for your urgent views on the following points:- (a) what do you consider would be the consequence if we were to take the line that we still feel that it would be premature and most undesirable to attempt to embark on treaty negotiations during the next few months, when the Palestine problem is likely to come to a head and the Egyptian question is still unsettled? (b) how far would it meet the Iraqi Government's requirements if we were to offer to reach agreement on the basis on which negotiations might take place at some unspecified future date, .e.g continuance of alliance for further period of twenty- five years, future sharing of air bases, and provisions for joint military co-operation in peace, emergency and v/ar, including detailed examination of the advance arrangements necessary to enable us to fulfil our obligations as allies to come to the aid of Iraq promptly in case of need? / (c)- 2 - (c) could wc expect to negotiate raoro satisfactory long-term treaty now than- in 1952? Would Iraqi Parliament end Iraqi opinion c.pprovc a treaty giving us any military facilities at all at a time when the question of our future military facilities in Ugypt is still unsettled? (d) 'Would a long-term treaty concluded now be regarded in Iraq as a lasting settlement, or should we be likely in a few months or years to be faced with fresh demands for treaty revision?AMENDED DISTRIBUTION 5th August, 1947.

R. 7.50 p.m. 1st August, 1947 0 0 0 0 IMMEDIATE LIGHT TOP SECRET Your telegram No. 657. It is important that it should be realised that from the Iraqi point of view treaty revision means almost exclusively evacuation of bases. We may v be**abM to make 'play’’■with minor*•• concessions but evacuation will remain the main point. 2. Your paragraph 2(A). Though the Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted (see my telegram No. 355) that the Iraqi Government were not entitled to ask for revision until 3952, the Iraqi Prime Minister in endeavour to appease nationalist opinion [? grp*, omitted] gone very far towards committing himself to the press for revision now. If faced with blank refusal from us he would almost certainly threaten to resign. It is impossible to say whether he would implement the threat (which if carried out would be serious setback to our plans for the economic development of Iraq) but his position would certainly be difficult if y/e refused to meet him at all. Particularly if he resigned on treaty issues the Regent would find it very difficult to get anyone to replace him. There might be the danger of an appeal to the United Nations. The Prime Minister fully realises the difficulty of Palestine and Egypt. His hope has always been (see records of meetings enclosed in my despatch No. 178) that all the Arab States would collaborate with Great Britain. If # as now appears probable, general collaboration will not /be2 /4 • • be possible for some time, the Prime Minister feels that the position of Iraq and Transjordan, which alone have British bases, will be very difficult owing to the •' ^ pressure of public opinion. He will certainly maintain that Iraq, cannot wait until 1952 or indeed for anything like as long, before demanding revision. 5. Your 2(b). The main difficulty is that what the Prime Minister wants is something definite he can announce to Parliament in December. The assurance that vr G will negotiate at unspecified future date will not help him much. I suggest that we should give him as much ammunition as we can on minor points which we are ( * prepared to concede by exchange of letters (e.g., air baseguards (see His Royal Highness Vs letter of April 25th)). (See your despatch No. 52). On the main point we could harp on the Prime Minister’s own theme that the defence of the Middle East Y^as matter for coordination between Great Britain and the Arab League as a vtiole. (He vdll probably argue that it is up to us to bring the Arab States together, so we should be ready to give some assurance that we were working to that end). How could Iraq suggest revision of the main clauses of the treaty when the Egyptian and Palestinian questions were still in the air? It would give the Prime Minister useful ammunition if we could tell him that British troops in Iraq would definitely be out of the country by December 1st, I hope.every effort is being made to accelerate their departure. If the Prime Minister still insisted that, he must have something more for Parliament, I think it would have most useful influence, particularly on the Regent, if we could make some fairly definite statement about the financial assistance for Iraqi military expenditure, going beyond phraseology.used in the letter attached to the sterling balance agreement, depending on how the‘talks went. vr e might then find it necessary to suggest sharing bases as soon as time was ripe for negotiation. (Air Officer Commanding has been in communication with Air Headquarters Middle East). A. O.C. sees no objection to sharing Habbaniya and v/ould be prepared to hand over Shaiba completely if we could move to Kowelt. Other points you make have already been put to Iraqis in military talks. It might.be suggested to the Prime Minister that he should make a statement to Parliament to the effect that he had had most useful preliminary discussions with His Majesty’s Government who, he v?as glad to say, were prepared to go a long way to meeting Iraqi desiderata. He could then quote our minor concessions. The main point wa.s .complicated not only in itself, but forms confused situation in the Middle East. Details vrould be discussed by experts on both sides who‘would report to their respective Governments.€6 5. 4. I should [? grp. omitted] if it would be much use mentioning the possibility of some form of lease for bases to meet Iraqi armour propre. It will be much [grp. undec] if Security Council have recommended resumption of negotiations between His Majesty’s (}overnment and the Egyptian Government,. If the solution proposed by the United Nations for Palestine is thoroughly unsatisfactory to the Arabs, pressure on the Prime Minister to take violent action will be very heavy. 5. Your 2(c). While we obviously [grp. undec ? cannot] negotiate firm long-term treaty at present moment I should prefer not to wait until the last minute in 1952. Iraqi Parliamentary opinion is difficult to gauge as it is selfish and opportunist. If the Regent and Nuri Pasha back Prime Minister whole-heartedly, Prime Minister should be able for the present to get away with the line proposed in paragraph 3 above but I can obviously not guarantee it. The Prime Minister will need a lot of persuading. The opinion of the man in the street would not weigh much but the press would influence members of Parliament. The tide of nationalism is rising in the Middle East, though perhaps slower in Iraq than elsewhere. Much would of course depend on the international situation in 1952. If Iraq were threatened actively from the north she would be easier for us to handle. This potential danger should of course be rubbed in all the time. 5. [sic] Your 2(d). There is little hope of. permanence for a treaty v/hich was purely bilateral if it included occupation of bases. There would be much greater hope of permanence for treaty which fitted into^the framework of the Middle East defence as a whole, and which provided for sharing of bases. 6. As regards the timing, might it not be better to ask the Prime Minister to postpone his visit until November which he is quite prepared to do (see my telegram No. 702)♦ This would have two advantages. Firstly, you would be able to sound the ground with the Regent and Nuri* who are likely to be more pliable. It might be possible to get His Royal Highness to commit himself to some extent to our views and in particular to agree that it would be better to postpone the revision of Iraqi treaty until the defence of Middle East can be dealt with as a whole (your telegram No. 505). Something in the nature of an agreed /recordrecord of meetings might be very useful. Secondly! by November we should know how the Egypt and Palestine cases are going and the future should be a bit clearer, Nurf could probably attend in November too, * 7.- See my despatch No, 208 of July 51st on the internal political situation, 8, Date of Regent l s arrival in London is not known here. 9, A«0.C. concurs.[This telegram is of particular se&amp;Cgcy and should be I X IJ -L uO X -L d 111 X D W x x x * “1 X 1 retained by the authorised recipient and not passed onj Cypher/OTP CABINET DISTRIBUTION 2 ' lrT *“ ————— ^ i ■ FROM BaGD-hD TO FOREIGN OFFICE , itonehewer Bird.

On April 27th at the conclusion of the debate in the Senate on his Government's policy, thelraqi Prime Minister spoke as follows about treaty revision: 'The basis for revision will be determined after careful study. The Iraqi [grp.undec.] will consult^ nationalists, whose views are considered to be in dis agreement. This however does not mean that such con sultations will be binding or be allowed to [grp, undec. ? withhold progress of] negotiations for which the Government will be responsible. I have no desire to touch upon what happened in certain other countries. The Government relies on itself in undertaking negotiations 1 ’. In reply to a question the Prime Minister had previously replied that the Cabinet could not indicate to the public the points of the treaty requiring revision. 2. The Prime Minister’s reference to ’’certain other countries” meant of course Egypt, In conversation with members of my staff on two occasions in the last few days he declared that he would allow none of the nonsense which characterised the Egyptian treaty negot- o\ iations to be repeated in Iraq. It remains.to be seen however just how firm he will be. He certainly has no intention of rushing things. 3, In a recent interview with Reuter correspondent which you may already have seen, the Prime Minister said: ”1 agree that this treaty does not expire until 1957 but the Iraqi political situation demands revision. I believe Britain shares this view. My policy is to build up solid relations and friendship with Britain. Treaty revision will be on a basis of equality and on mutual interest and benefit of both nations.r W TWARD TELEGRAM If f* 0 mm SECREt Ir^tL Cl Gypiier/OTP Restricted. ^1 GEliEPuiL DISTRIBUTION.

IraQi Prime Minister is reported to have given an interview to Arab News Agency in Cairo and in reply to a question about treaty revision to have said 'the Iraqi Government has approached the British Government on the question of revision of treaty binding the two countries and the British reply was to accept with pleasure'. He allegedly went on to say that as Iraq has no other goal in its foreign policy than to maintain special friendship with Britain, his Government had asked for opening of negotiations to make alliance conform with recent developments and to bring it into line with the San Francisco Charter. 2. In point of fact Iraqi Government has made no (repeat no) official approach. The only public mention oT treaty revision was that described in paragraph 1 a) of my telegram No.185. Nevertheless it seems clear that a formal request for revision will be submitted shortly and it is most important that I should be acquainted with your views on the whole matter.- 2 - 3, In regard to the two points mentioned in paragraph 4 of my telegram No*17L, my views are contained in my despatch No*192 of May 7th [sic]* I assume that you are in agreement with them but I should be grateful if you would confirm this and also instruct me what attitude I should adopt in regard to revision in general* 4, There is no doubt, as I suggested in my telegram No*171, that recent events in Egypt have stimulated more extreme nationalists here* It is perhaps significant that in the interview referred to above, the Iraqi Prime Minister when asked if request for treaty revision negotia tions was based on evacuation of British troops in Iraq, is reported to have replied ‘‘we have no occupation so there can be no evacuation® British forces in Iraq will not exceed 2,000 men and they will be restricted to airfields which Iraqi forces are responsible for guarding'. 5, If any [grp. undec*] request for revision is received I presume you would wish me to suggest that a representative of the Government should be chosen to conduct negotiations in London on Egyptian precedent.

It is suggested that publication was desired •• n by the last Iraqi Cabinet for face-saving purposes at the expense of preceding Governments. The 'explanatory notes' are based on a series of correspondence exchanged with the Iraqi Government in connection with the 1930 Treaty, but they give a very garbled and one-sided idea of this correspondence and His Majesty’s Government could nevti agree to publication in the form suggested by Dr.Damluji. sir Francis Humphrys referred the proposal to the Foreign Office for instructions, but since then there have been Cabinet changes in Iraq and it is quite possible that Nuri Pasha, the present Iraqi Foreign ’ lnlE,ter . will not wish to pursue the matter further. In these circumstances the Foreign Office,in replying to Sir Francis Humphrys' despatch, propose to leave it to the discretion of Mr.Ogilvie Forbes, the Charge d’Affaires whether to tasce tie initiative in carrying the matter further or to wait until the Iraqi Government themselves revert to it, and at the same time to inform Mr.Ogilvie Forbes that, though there is no objection in principle to the publication of the correspondence in question, this could only be allowed on the strict understanding that(94) I rblvJPcrfur* ~fe- fijjktifc y^nru^l kK&amp;db&amp;i &amp;**/ llAjor j-A _ .'

In certain circumstances (for example if the question of the date gardens should ever be taken to arbitration) there might be some advantage from our point of view in publishing the correspondence, but we need not, I think, mention this in writing to the Foreign Office in view of our present negotiations with the Iraqi Government on the question of the date gardens, and we can, I think, concur in the terms of the Foreign Office draft despatch.

It seems likely that a proposal of this kind would have the effect of causing Dr* Damluji to withdraw his request. vn the other hand, if he agreed, a matter which has been the subject of much misunderstanding would be cleared up once and for all, and the necessary legislation In respect of the new Air Defence Force could be presented to Parliament without further delay.

It will be seen that there have been general protestations of continued friendship with His Majesty's Government and that the Amir Abdullah has particularly exhorted the King always to seek Sir F. Humphrys' advice. But, owing to Ghazi's youth and inexperience, the Ambassador will no longer be able to influence the Iraqi Government through the King but will have to have more direct relations with them - and that may mean another story. Moreover, the King has headstrong tendencies and as Sir F. Humphrys puts it, 'the qualities and ideals of a beau sabreur are not sufficient equipment for one who is to sit securely on the Throne of Iraq.' (Sd.) A.F.

Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received September 19.) (No. 595.) Sir, Bagdad, September 14, 1933. WITH reference to my telegram No. 337 of the 8th September, I have the honour to report that I first received news of King Feisal’s death early on the morning of the 8th September through a telephone message from the palace. I immediately called on the Prime Minister and expressed to his Excellency the condolences of His Majesty’s Government and my own personal sorrow for the death of King Feisal, and my sympathy with Iraq at the tragic loss which she had suffered by this melancholy event. His Excellency thanked me for my words and was good enough to say that the knowledge of the sympathy and support of His Majesty’s Government was a great source of comfort to him and his colleagues in their grief and bereavement. He then asked Yasin Pasha to join us, and they discussed with me briefly the action which was necessary in view of the King’s death. I advised swift compliance with the provisions of the Organic Law. They agreed and said that arrangements would be made for proclaiming the accession of the Amir Ghazi before the general public were aware of King Feisal’s death. They also consulted me about the position of the Cabinet. I said that under their Constitution the Cabinet should resign, and I hoped that they would he reappointed by the new King immediately, without change, as in times of excite ment it was important to preserve continuity. The Ministers also sought m} advice on several small protocolaire questions, and before I took my leave both of them offered me the most solemn, and, I believe, sincere assurances that the Government were resolved, as a duty to the memory of the late King, to maintain the closest and most friendly relations with Great Britain, and to seek the advice and assistance of His Majesty’s representatives on all important matters concerning the future of Iraq and the mutual interests of the two countries. 2. At 10 o’clock on the same morning, in the presence of the Cabinet, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the Vice-President of the Senate and senior officials of the Government, His Royal Highness the Amir Ghazi took the oath to defend the Constitution laid down in article 21 of the Organic Law, and he was thereupon proclaimed King, as “Ghazi I.” The public were informed of his accession by the firing of a salute of 101 guns. Three minutes later the new King drove in procession to the palace and received the homage of the Royal Family, the Cabinet, former Ministers, high military and civil officials, religious dignitaries and notables of the city. At 2 p.m. His Majesty received the heads of diplomatic missions separately in audience. I said that my Sovereign and His Majesty’s Government would be deeply grieved by this tragic loss, and when I spoke of my own personal bereavement the young King broke down and was unable to reply. The same evening the Prime Minister placed the resignation of the Cabinet in His Majesty’s hands. 3. On the following morning King Ghazi invited me to see him privately, and I spent an hour with him discussing the immediate necessities of the situation. He spoke feelingly of the great help which his father had always enjoyed from His Majesty’s Government, and declared his intention of following his father’s policy of friendship and close co-operation wdth Great Britain. He hoped that I would always extend to him the same degree of confidence and personal counsel as I had given to the late King. 4. A few hours later His Majesty issued a Royal Iradah reappointing all the members of the Cabinet to their old posts. At the customary semi-public ceremony which takes place on such occasions, the Prime Minister made a speech in which he stated that the policy which would be followed in the future would be the same as that to which King Feisal had always adhered in the past, a policy of close friendship and alliance with Great Britain. On Monday, the [907 t—112 11th September, in the presence of a special session of the Senate and C hamber of Deputies, King Ghazi again took the prescribed oath of loyalty to the Organic Law, and the constitutional formalities of his accession were thereby completed. 5. The death of King Feisal has naturally come as a great shock to everyone in Iraq, and the processions of mourners which have daily thronged the streets of Bagdad since the news of his demise was received testify to the grief which his passing has stirred in the hearts of the people. In political circles, wher^| his shortcomings were realised and often severely criticised, his death has brought with it a keener appreciation of the great work which he accomplished, and a fresh proof of the old adage that water is not rightly valued until the well runs dry. It is realised that King FeisaTs death has left a gap in the political life of the country which will never, perhaps, be filled. It was he who founded the Iraq State and who guided it through the many perplexing difficulties which have been encountered during the twelve years of his reign, and those whom he has left to carry on his work are beginning to appreciate more fully the great burden of heavy responsibility which he bore. It was King Feisal's skill and political subtlety which enabled him to hold the delicate balance between Sunni and Shiah, and through his profound understanding of the Arab mind he was able to deal with his turbulent tribal chieftains with a marked degree of success. The new King has neither the training nor the experience to fit him to continue this work, and there is, I fear, a danger that a Government in which a Sunni Effendi element is always likely to predominate may fail through want of sympathetic understanding either to conciliate the Shiahs or to control the sheikhs as success fully as the late King. In internal political circles the loss of his guiding hand will also be acutely felt. In spite of the faults inherent in his highly-strung and imaginative temperament, his noble birth and his romantic leadership of the Arab cause placed him in an exalted position which commanded respect; a position above the local party rivalries and personal jealousies of the country from which he could and did, in a very great measure, rule as well as reign. His successor for some years at any rate will have to play a less influential role, and it remains to be seen whether, deprived of King Feisal's control, the governing class will have the wisdom to subordinate party feeling to the interests of the country. 6. His Majesty’s death will also bring about a big change in the position of the Ambassador vis-a-vis the Iraqi Government. Hitherto British representa tives in Iraq have, in the main, exercised their influence on the Government, in all matters outside the scope of normal relations, through friendly and confidential intercourse with the King. In future they will have to rely on more direct relations with the Government, since it is unlikely that King Ghazi will be able, either by persuasion or pressure, to exert much effective influence upon his Ministers. At present the Cabinet seem to be genuinely anxious to ensure that the same close touch is maintained with the Embassy as in the past, and I have been specially requested by the Prime Minister and by Yasin Pasha to continue my frequent visits to the palace, but I anticipate that as time passes it will be found that the death of King Feisal will deprive the Ambassador of the most effective means which he had at his disposal of guiding unobtrusively the policy of the Iraqi Government. 7. Though he comes to the throne with little of his father’s glamour and none of his varied experience, the new King is not a factor to be ignored in an appreciation of the possibilities of the future. Though young, he is said already to show signs of being obstinately opinionated, and much will depend on the character of those who win influence over him. Up to the present his views have to a great extent been moulded by the young officers of the army, who have been his companions, and though his military training has made him a plucky horseman and keen cavalry officer, the qualities and ideals of a beau sabreur are not sufficient equipment for one who is to sit securely on the Throne of Iraq. As the idol of the army he is exposed to an insidious temptation to vanity that may well lead him to disregard the counsels of wiser men, but it is to be hoped that time and experience will bring him a level head and an armour against that worthless flattery which is the worst enemy of Eastern Kings. 8. The future is necessarily full of uncertainties, but the personal assurances of the new King, the public announcement of the Prime Minister, the confidences revealed to me in private by Yasin Pasha and the tone of the semi-official press all point to a present resolve to work for the continuance of close and friendly relations with Great Britain. I believe that even the extremist politicians realisethe necessity for British advice and assistance so long as it leads them along the path of independence and progress. It is my conviction, however, that the present favourable atmosphere will undergo a radical change for the worse if the Council of the League, backed by Great Britain, attempts to force on Iraq a form of foreign intervention which can be shown to be without precedent in its dealings with other sovereign States. Should it appear that the League, with the Approval of Great Britain, is trying to take back with its left hand any portion of the independence which it gave with its right hand at Geneva last year, the Iraqi Government will resist with all the resources at their command. In such an event nothing but chaos could result. The generous policy which has been followed in this country by successive Governments in Great Britain for the past twelve years would go down to history as a tragic failure, and France would sav “ I told you so.” 9.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 232, reporting the suspension of the newspaper, the A kali, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a note from the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs in reply to the two notes (copies 3'^ 9/ of which were forwarded to you in my despatch No. 496 o f the 3rd August) which I recently addressed to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in protest against the hostile attitude adopted by the Iraqi press in general and the Ahali in particular. 2. I also enclose a translation of extracts^) from the Ahali of the 6th and 7th August, from which you will observe that the newspaper was not deterred from continuing its attacks on British policy by the warning from the Press Bureau, which it was obliged to publish in the number of the 6th August. The journal was consequently suspended on the 8th August for a period of ten days. 3. The suspension of the Istiqlal, to which the Ministry refer in their note, was provoked by its embarking upon Sunni-Shiah controversy (see my despatch No. 503 of the 3rd August) and had no connexion with its offensively anti-British attitude. 4. With the exception of the now suspended Ahali, there has been a notable absence of hostile articles in the Arabic press for the past few days. The Iraqi Government are doubtless encouraged to put an end to these attacks on Great Britain by their desire to secure the diplomatic assistance of His Majesty’s Government at Geneva in the event of the Assyrian question coming before the Council of the League of Nations, and it is significant that the Ikha-al-Watani, the semi-official organ of the present Government, expresses in its number of the 8th August the hope that Iraq will be able to rely upon support from her ££ great ally ” in denouncing the conduct of the French authorities in Syria in allowing the emigrant Assyrians to return to Iraq with their arms. 5. The campaign of abuse and allegation has now been transferred to the French Government, who are vociferously denounced in all the Arabic newspapers as the cause of the recent bloodshed. I have, &amp;c. G. OGILVIE-FORBES. Enclosure in No. 1. Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs to British Embassy, Bagdad. THE Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their compliments to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad, and, with reference to the two letters addressed to his Excellency the Prime Minister by the Charge d’Affaires of His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, of which one dealt with a leading article published in the A hali newspaper and the other with the tone of the Bagdad press as a whole, have the honour to inform the Embassy that immediately upon the receipt of the two above-mentioned letters of the Embassy, his Excellency the Prime Minister instructed the competent authorities to take the necessary steps with a view to the local press avoiding the publication of any matter of a nature inconsistent with the spirit of accord and sincere amity characterising Anglo-Iraqi relations. The competent authorities carried out the instructions given them, exercising the maximum powers vested in them by law, and warned [879 s—31 P) Not printed.2 the Ahali newspaper for the publication of the article dealt with in the Embassy's letter, and then suspended that journal temporarily. As regards the Istiqlal newspaper, this had already been suspended by a decision of the Council of Ministers. , The authorities have also drawn the attention of all newspapers to tne necessity of avoiding the publication of matter calculated to arouse unfriend y feelings towards the British Government. The Ministry wish that His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy should feel certain that the Iraqi Government have been, and continue to be, anxious for the consoli dation of the relations of amity and friendship obtaining between the two allied Governments. They the Iraqi Government—translator] have (already given) such ample evidence of this that they need not put forward any further proof. There is. therefore, no question of it having occurred to them to adopt a negative attitude in this matter. His Excellency the Prime Minister regrets what has happened, and the Iraqi Government trust that the British Government will always feel confident of their good intentions, in view of the earnest and constant desire of the Iraqi Govern ment for the continuance, undisturbed by anything, of the good relations obtaining between the two States.

EASTERN (Iraq). [E 4478/685/93] CONFIDENTIAL. No. 1. Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes to Sir John Simon. — (Received August 9.) (No. 496.) Sir, Bagdad, August 3, 1933. ON receipt of the instructions contained in your telegram No. 146, I addressed to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs a note, a copy of which I have the honour to enclose, conveying to his Excellency a sense of the concern with which His Majesty’s Government view, the campaign of slander and defamation which the Iraqi press is conducting against Great Britain, and enquiring what action the Iraqi Government propose to take in the matter. 2. While this note was in preparation I learned of the publication on the 30th July in the Ahali, a journal of socialistic sympathies, which possesses a wide circulation in Iraq, of an article containing allegations of such a gross and dangerous character in connexion with the present Assyrian crisis that I considered it essential to lodge an immediate and specific protest. I accordingly addressed a note to Rashid Ali Beg (a copy of which is also enclosed), requesting his Excellency to take steps to have a dementi inserted in that newspaper in as prominent a position as the offending article, failing which I suggested that there were grounds for its suspension. I also took the opportunity to inform his Excellency that he was about to receive a further note which you had instructed me to address to him on the subject of the anti-British attitude adopted by the Iraqi press in general and with increasing intensity during the last few weeks. 3. I learn from various sources in touch with local opinion that, largely as a result of the recent unlicensed campaign of slander and misrepresentation in the press, the view is generally held in Bagdad that His Majesty’s Government have deliberately provoked the recent incidents in the north, and that the Royal Air Force have been in active touch with the Assyrian “ rebels ” throughout the whole period. As an example of the present state of mind of Iraqi officialdom, I may add that I am creditably informed that three-quarters of the budget and almost all the energies of the intelligence branch of the Iraqi army are being expended in shadowing the movements of the special service officers of the Royal Air Force. I have, &amp;c. G. OGILVIE-FORBES. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bagdad. Your Excellency, Bagdad. August 1, 1933. I HAVE the honour, under instructions from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to draw your Excellency’s attention to the increasingly hostile attitude which has characterised the Bagdad press during the last two months., No opportunity has been lost of misinterpreting the policy and actions of my country in the most offensive spirit and of imputing to His Majesty’s Government the most discreditable motives. I regret that this applies without exception to all the political newspapers published in this capital. 2. It is unnecessary to cite specific examples of this attitude, as they are to be found in abundance by a perusal of the Arabic press at any time during the last few weeks, and it is impossible that they should have escaped your Excellency’s notice. I wish, however, to diW particular attention to' the scandalous allegations made recently in the Ikha-al- Watani, the Istiqlal and the Ahali, that Gieat Biitain, the ally of Iraq, has of late deliberately fostered [879 i—2]2 unrest and disaffection amongst the Assyrians and has fomented dissension between the Shiah and Sunni communities. These allegations have been reproduced in the press without any attempt by the Iraqi Government to put a stop to such a libel on their ally or to correct the most unfortunate impression which must follow from the uncontrolled circulation of untruths of this nature. 3. His Majesty’s Government have learnt of the hostile tone adopted by the Iraqi press with great concern, and take a serious view of the situation, since^ they can only regard as unfriendly the attitude of the Iraqi Government in allowing such a campaign of slander and vilification to continue unchecked. The negative attitude of the Iraqi Government is all the more disappointing to His Majesty’s Government in view of the cordial reception accorded to His Majesty King Feisal in the United Kingdom. It is in striking contrast to the sentiments expressed by His Majesty and his Ministers during the Royal visit. 4. I am instructed to enquire from your Excellency what action the Iraqi Government propose to take in order to prevent a continuation of these false and mischievous attacks upon a friendly and allied Government. I avail, &amp;c. G. OGILVIE-FORBES. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bagdad. Your Excellency, Bagdad, August 1, 1933. I HAVE the honour to enclose a translation of a leading article in the Ahali of the 30th July, which contains most offensive and unfounded allegations as to the connexion of Great Britain with the present unrest amongst the Assyrians. 2. I have no reason to believe that this translation contains any material maccui acies. I accordingly look to your Excellency to take the necessary steps tor the publication of a denial in as prominent position as the article in question. which 1 would suggest that the Iraqi Government should consider whether this is not a case for the exercise of their suspensorv powers under the Press Law. 3. I should add that, on instructions from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I am about to address'a further official note to the Iraqi Government conveying the grave concern with which my Government view the increasingly unfriendly tone of the Iraqi press. I avail, &amp;c. G. OGILVIE-FORBES. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Extract from the Ahali of July 30, 1933. (Translation.) The Assyrian Question and the Present Political Situation. from the north indicate that the English are in constant touch with the Tian rebels m the frontier district of Wadi Sifan. This touch is not being maintained only through secret messengers and British army intelligence officers, but is also being insured by British military aircraft and armoured cars. It is possible that these military means ” are supplying the rebels with what is necessary for the continuance of rebellion and disobedience. If this renort is true, as it appears to be, then Great Britain is adopting a disgraceful and ignominious attitude; while the Iraqi Government are m g a mosJcrUica and serious position, not only in so far as regards the Tiari question in itself but also m view of the attitude of the English, which aggravates the situation' Should the [Iraqi] Government ignore this attitude and fail to consider the3 interference of the English in this affair to be contrary to international principles and to constitute an international incident, we would lose even our nominal and counterfeited independence, and we would be establishing a bad precedent for British interference in all our affairs. Indeed, the action to be adopted by the Cabinet and the international attitude it will adopt will place the Iraqi Government on the parting of roads, gither for the good or for the bad. ' The Government should use all the strength they possess in the punishment of the rebels, and should consider the attitude adopted by the English in this connexion as definite interference in contravention of international principles. They should address a formal warning to the British Government through the usual diplomatic channels and should immediately refer the question to the League of Nations, using all possible diplomatic means with the League for the settlement of this and similar questions and the definition of our relations with this ally. The present is a great opportunity open before our Government for a fundamental revision of the Tiari question. They should reconsider the question of their settlement as a rebel group constituting a menace to the safety of the State. This question should be reconsidered on the ground that the Government had committed a great mistake in consenting to the settlement of the Tiaris in the vicinity of the frontier at a time when they showed themselves disposed to be peaceful. But now that they have openly declared themselves hostile to the country which had afforded them a shelter, and have ungratefully rebelled against it, they should be disarmed and should be scattered in localities remote from the frontier. It would be high treason on the part of any Iraqi Government to allow this group of rebels to be settled in localities close to each other. Turkey and Persia have, thanks to their loyal leaders and to the independence that they enjoy, got rid of these ignominious conditions. We do not agree that our country should alone remain a field for mischief-making and a toy in the hands of the foreigners. Britain should be made to understand that the policy of “ divide and rule,” which she pursued in the past, is a policy of the past.indexed In any further communication on this subject No. £Cfif-JS and address —not to any person by ~ “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreig THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affaii^ presents his compliments to and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper. c ^&lt;Cc &lt;\\ A \ Foreign Office, /6 ■ * 193J ' / Reference to previous correspondence : U y Description Enclosure.I2A [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] Decode No. 232, D.

Bagdad, June 26, 1933. s Mr. ' 405.) ’ FOR some weeks prior to the departure of His Majesty’s Ambassador in May last there had been a good deal of agitation in the Bagdad press against the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. Some of the airy and vapid talk of the sacred aspirations of the Iraqi people found its echo in Earliament, and speculation was rife as to whether His Majesty King Feisal would find an opportunity to broach the question of treaty revision in London, and if so how far he would be successful in removing those provisions to which the extreme Nationalists profess to object. 2. During the course of an interview with Sir Francis Humphrys on the 17th May last, His Majesty expressed the view that, in view of his own impending departure, it was essential that the position of the Iraqi Government in regard to their relations with Great Britain should be made clear, if only to dissipate certain current misconceptions regarding the object of his visit to London. He deplored the pusillanimity of his Ministers, all of whom protested anxiety individually to preserve the closest relations with Great Britain. Not one had the courage, however, to come into the open and do his share towards the settle ment of the outstanding questions arising from the treaty for fear that his Cabinet colleagues would make political capital at his expense. This drifting with the stream had gone far enough, and he had decided that, before he left Iraq, the Government must make an unequivocal statement of policy which would eliminate the possibility of any misunderstanding concerning the attitude of the Iraqi Government towards Great Britain. He hoped it would be possible for such a statement to be made on the introduction of the budget a few days later. 3. His Majestv left Iraq on the 5th June, but neither before his departure nor since have I been able to discover any trace of an unequivocal statement by the Government on the lines suggested on the 17th May. On the contrary, during the opening debate on the budget, the Prime Minister, replying to several pointed questions on the relationsKetween Great Britain and Iraq, said : ‘ ‘ W^Mve no new foreign policy other than of aiming at the realisation, at the earliest opportunity, of the sacred aspirations of the people, which have been and continue to be the aspirations of every patriotic citizen. We have placed this sacred object before our eyes and are proceeding for its realisation with wisdom and resolution, guided by the unerring and whole some advice of His Majesty. “ The acceptance by His Majesty of the invitation extended to him by His Majesty the King of Great Britain will be most effective in strengthening the friendly relations between the two kingdoms. We are hopeful of realising the greatest material and moral benefits from this auspicious visit. “ The high political position now enjoyed by our beloved country among the nations of the world will improve in proportion to the future cultural and constructive achievements of the country and to the extent to which we shall have shown ourselves able to improve the administration of justice and to satisfy the world that we have taken all possible effective steps to enable us to undertake the defence of our country by our own hands.” 4. On the 3rd June, during the resumed discussion on the budget, Yasin Pasha, the Minister of Finance, replying to the former Prime Minister, said : “ I say that there is no doubt that the treaty was a step forward. “ It should be understood that all treaties are subject to ratification by legislative councils, and that the Iraqi nation has not yet been represented on such councils. Our admission to the League of Nations was due to a promise given by Great Britain in 1929. therefore we cannot credit to the treaty our admission to the League.” 5. There has, it is true, been a diminution in the press criticism of the treaty since the King’s departure, but I cannot bring myself to believe that this is, in anv wav due to the evasive statements of the Government’s chief spokesmen.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 50 of the 20th March, I have the honour to report the following further developments in the political situation in Iraq. 2. On the morning of the 17th March the Bagdad press published reports of a debate in the Chamber on the reply to the Speech from the Throne, which had taken place on the previous day. From these I observed that Yasin Pasha and others had made speeches in which they had urged the Government to endeavour to obtain a revision of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930. I enclose a summary( l ) of the debate, compiled from newspaper reports, from which it will be seen that the treaty was criticised as unjust and oppressive by reason of the immense burden of debt which it laid on the shoulders of Iraq, and the foreign forces and advisers which it imposed on the country. 3. Knowing the King's intention to form a new Cabinet and to appoint Yasin Pasha as Minister for Finance, I felt it necessary to warn him of the significance which would naturally be attached to such a change after this debate. I therefore sought and obtained an immediate audience with His Majesty. The following paragraphs summarise the main features of our conversation, which lasted for more than three hours :— 4. I opened my remarks by recalling that in the several previous discussions which we had recently had on the subject of His Majesty’s wish to form a new Cabinet he had met my misgivings regarding the inclusion of Yasin Pasha by assuring me that the latter’s hostility to the Treaty of Alliance of 1930 had arisen solely from his personal differences with Nuri Pasha, and was not inspired by any real objection to the principles or provisions of the treaty per se. His Majesty had asked me to believe that these personal differences were a thing of the past and that no one in public life had now the least desire to alter the bases on which Anglo-Iraqi relations had been established by the treaty. 5. It had come, therefore, as a great surprise to me to see that, in the debate on the Speech from the Throne, Yasin Pasha and several of his associates had pressed the Government to seek an opportunity to amend the treaty, which they had frankly described as oppressive and unjust and inconsistent with Iraq's independence. I added that I felt it necessary to warn His Majesty that if, after such a debate, Naji Beg’s Cabinet were to resign and a new Cabinet were formed including Yasin Pasha, and others known to be largely under his influence, the conclusion which would naturally and logically be drawn by His Majesty’s Government and by the outside world was that the change of Government indicated a change of policy towards Great Britain. 6. The King began his reply by suggesting that the reports which I had seen of what Yasin Pasha had said in the Chamber the previous day were possibly not altogether correct, and he produced a copy of the daily newspaper, the Ikha-al- Wataui, in which the report of Yasin's speech omitted all mention of a demand for the amendment of the treaty, and suggested that as this paper was the official organ of the party of which Yasin Pasha was the leader, its version of his speech should be accepted as authentic. I demonstrated the weakness of this argument by showing the King that Yasin Pasha's strictures on the treaty had been published in all other newspapers, two of whose editors were themselves Deputies and had been present during the debate. Moreover, the Prime Minister, who had spoken after Yasin Pasha, had defended the attitude of his Government towards the treaty, and it would have been unnecessary for him to have done so if Yasin Pasha had not attacked him on this point. King Feisal then abandoned the suggestion that Yasin Pasha had been misreported, and went on to say that p) Not printed. [767 c—1]3 Government of the best men available and to test their fitness to administer the country. 1 had criticised his plans, but he still believed them to be sound, and he could do no more than renew the assurances which he had already given. I calmed His Majesty to some extent with soothing words of appreciation of all that he had achieved during the past twelve years, but I added that, much as I ^gretted it, I felt obliged to repeat the warnings which I had already given regarding the step which he proposed to take, and I recalled the unhappy results which had followed a previous experiment of the same kind, when, in 1929, Yasin Pasha, at His Majesty’s instance, had been introduced into Abdul Muhsin Beg's Cabinet. 10. I could not hide from him the fact that, whatever private assurances were given to me. His Majesty’s Government and, moreover, the British public, who followed events in Iraq closely through the press, would certainly consider that, in the circumstances attending its formation, the new Cabinet would come into office not to continue, but to change, the policy of the two preceding Cabinets in regard to Iraq’s relations with Great Britain. This conclusion could only be modified through a clear and unequivocal statement by the new Cabinet that they intended to stand by the treaty and implement its provisions. Would the new Cabinet, I asked, make such a statement? The King left the answer of this question to Nuri Pasha, who said that, as the Cabinet had not yet been formed officially, no programme had yet been drawn up. When they took office they would necessarily meet together for that purpose, and he would do his utmost to obtain the inclusion of an affirmation of the Government’s intention to respect all Iraq’s treaties with foreign Governments. I said that he had heard the assurances which the King had given that the change of Government meant no change of policy towards Great Britain. There seemed to me, therefore, to be no reason why the new Government should not make it perfectly clear in their programme that they intended to carry on their relations with Great Britain both in the spirit and the letter of the treaty, and I sincerely hoped that, in their own interests, they would do so. 11. I took my leave after a parting appeal to His Majesty not to allow us to be dragged back into the old fruitless political bickering, but to set politics aside and concentrate on administrative efficiency and the economic development of the country. 12. On the 19th March. Naji Beg Shaukat and his colleagues resigned, and on the next day Royal irades were issued appointing the following Cabinet:— Prime Minister : Rashid Ali Beg A1 Gilani. Minister for Finance : Yasin Pasha A1 Hashimi. Minister for Foreign Affairs : Nuri Pasha A1 Said. Minister for Economics and Communications : Rustam Beg Haidar. Minister for Interior : Hikmat Beg Sulaiman. Minister of Defence : Jallal Beg Baban. Minister of Justice : Muhammad Zaki Beg. Minister of Education : Saiyid Muhammad Mahdi. Of these. Yasin Pasha, Saiyid Muhammad Mahdi, Muhammad Zaki Beg and Hikmat Beg Sulaiman are members of the party of National Brotherhood, which has frequently declared its policy to be to work for the amendment of the treaty of 1930, though Hikmat Sulaiman was formerly a staunch supporter of Abdul Muhsin Beg, and I doubt whether he is really deeply attached to Yasin Pasha or his principles. Nuri Pasha and Rustam Beg are likely to work together, and the Prime Minister, though once a member of Yasin Pasha’s party, is now evidently a King’s man, and will be guided by the Palace. Naji Shaukat, who had not realised up to the last moment that he was to be sacrificed for Rashid Ali, and who had resigned mainly with the idea of having his own Cabinet strengthened, feels that he has been tricked, and has refused to accept any office. 13. King Feisal dined with me privately on the 19th, and renewed his assurances about the loyalty of the new Cabinet towards their obligations under the 1930 treaty. On the following morning His Majesty wrote me a personal letter, a translation of which is enclosed, together with my reply. I have. &amp;e. F. H. HUMPHRYS.o 4: Enclosure 1 in No. 1. King Feisal to Sir F. Humphrys.—(Received March 20, 1933.) (Translation.) (Personal and Secret.) Dear Sir Francis, IN my talks with you during the last few days 1 have found you unhappy as to the doubts which might be aroused in political circles and in the press in England by the change in the Cabinet, as you feared that the change would be regarded as introducing an alteration of some kind in the policy of the Iraqi Government towards the treaty on which the present friendly relations between the two countries are based. For this reason I confirm what I have already told you orally, that this change, consisting of the introduction of persons from the Opposition to positions of responsibility, will not only not prejudice our friendly relations, but will close our ranks and concentrate our endeavours towards the strengthening of our friendly relations, which are centred on the Treaty of Alliance, and will make all elements co-operate to gain our objective, which is the moral and economic development of the country and the strengthening of our friendship with our ally, Great Britain. This will be proved to you in deed in all the declarations and acts of the Cabinet in the shortest possible time. Your friend, FEISAL Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Sir F. Humphrys to King Feisal. (Secret and Personal.) Your Majesty, March 21, 1933. I AM most grateful for the secret and personal letter which I received from your Majesty yesterday, and for the assurances which your Majesty renewed therein that* the new Cabinet which has been formed would continue to work for the strengthening of the existing friendship between Iraq and Great Britain on the basis of the Treaty of Alliance, 1930. Your Majesty was kind enough to assure me that the goodwill of the new Cabinet towards Great Britain would, at the earliest opportunity, be made clear in their acts as well as in their words. I deeply appreciate this reaffirmation of what your Majesty has often been good enough to tell me in our private talks, and I sincerely trust that, in negotiating with them the several important questions touching the implemen tation of the Treaty of Alliance which are still outstanding, I shall find ample evidence of the spirit of friendly co-operation with which your Majesty is confident your new Ministers are inspired. I remain, &amp;c. F. H. HUMPHRYS.MMM COPVO. ^ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Iraq). April 10, 1933. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. | E 1853/105/93] No. 1. Sir F. Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received April 10.) (No. 207.) Sir, Bagdad. March 26, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 181 of the 22nd March, I have the honour to enclose herewith a record of a conversation which I had three days ago with Yasin Pasha A1 Hashimi, during which he sought to explain to me his position in the new Cabinet and his attitude towards several of the principal questions with which he and his colleagues will be called upon to deal. 2. I have the impression that, so far as he revealed his opinions to me, he spoke honestly and frankly, and I feel that our talk has done much to clear the air. Ilis views on the general provisions of the Treaty of 1930 are intelligent and understandable and his doubts regarding the practical merits of the Railway Corporation scheme are. I know, shared to some degree in many quarters under no suspicion of Anglophobia. 3. Whatever may have been the words which he used in the debate on the Speech from the Throne, I am disposed to believe that he told me the truth about his intentions. He has criticised the treaty itself, and still more, the extravagant terms in which Nuri Pasha s supporters have described it as the charter of Iraq's independence, and now. while he is willing to make the most that he can for Iraq out of the treaty, he will not publicly disavow the standpoint which he took up in opposition, that it merely marks a stage on the road towards his country’s emancipation from foreign control. Moreover, he distrusts the King, and is suspicious of His Majesty’s motives for bringing him back to office. Yasin has seen more than one man with a promising public career discredited and ruined because he had left his friends and broken with his principles for the sake of fickle Palace favour, and he has no intention of going the same way himself. He must, therefore, maintain his reputation and hold together his political supporters, so that, if necessary, he may safely withdraw from office to the Oppo sition without loss of influence or prestige. 4. I had experience of Yasin Pasha as a member of the Cabinet in 1929-30, when he was Minister of Finance in Naji Suwaidi’s Administration. On that occasion he dominated the Cabinet and, by his insistence on making too drastic reductions in the numbers of the British advisory staff, he was responsible for Naji Suwaidi’s downfall. Shortly before my arrival in Bagdad he had, in the opinion of my predecessor, goaded a former Prime Minister, Abdul Muhsin Beg, into suicide, by urging him to adopt a programme framed on extreme Nationalist lines. I am inclined to think, however, that two and a half years in opposition have mellowed his views, and that he is not ungrateful to His Majesty’s Govern ment for their successful sponsoring of Iraq’s candidature for membership of the League of Nations in 1932. I believe that his main objection to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 is to be found in the fact that it was negotiated by the King and his intimate advisers. Nuri and Jafar Pasha and Rustum Haidar, without his assistance. While I do not doubt that he will continue to dominate the Cabinet and will obstinately stand out for what he feels to be Iraq’s rights, his spontaneous avowal of his intention to consult me privately if things go wrong is a hopeful sign that he has moderated his extremist views. The main difficulty that I foresee, and this apprehension is shared by Yasin as well as by Nuri. is whether the new Cabinet, which is composed of men of independent character and opposite views, will be able to keep their peace with the King and avoid quarrelling among themselves. I have, &amp;c. F. H. HUMPHRYS. [767 k—1]2 Enclosure in No. 1. Record of a Conversation between Sir F. Humphrys and Yasin Pasha. YASIN PASHA, who is Minister of Finance in the new Cabinet, asked it l would receive him on the 22nd March, and we conversed for about two houis.A He said that he wished to dispel certain misapprehensions which had arisen regarding the speeches which he had made in the Chamber of Deputies on the 16th March, when he attacked Nuri Shaukat, the late Prime Minister, on the subject of the treaty. He said that he had been incorrectly reported in some ot the Bagdad newspapers. It was true that he had criticised adveisely the Financial Agreement signed by Nuri Pasha and myself in London in August 1930, which had been ratified with the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. 1 his did not mean, however, that he had any intention of agitating for the revision of the Financial Agreement, as he realised that his acceptance of office in the new Government implied agreement with the policy of his colleagues. On my asking what this policy was, he declined to define it in advance of the statement which he said would 'be shortly made by the Prime Minister. He said that he quite realised that the Treaty of 1930 and its annexures, after its ratification by the Parliaments of our two countries, had become an international bond which must be honourably observed by both parties, but he hoped that, if he remained in office, he would have the opportunity later to approach me, directly or indirectly, with a view r to the revision of the stipulations in the agreement which concerned the Iraq railways in particular. He admitted that the present arrangement could not be altered except by mutual consent, but he hoped that my Government would show generosity in a matter on which Iraqis of all shades of opinion held very strong views. I reminded him that the agreement on the subject of railways was based on the recommendations of Sir Hilton Young, who was one of the foremost experts of our time and had visited Iraq twice during recent years for the purpose of giving advice on financial questions. The scheme which had been laid down in that agreement involved the creation of a statutory board, whose operations would be subject to the provisions of a Railway Corporation Law. which was was to be passed by agreement between our two Governments. Until that law was passed and the scheme recommended by Sir Hilton Young had been tried, it was clearly unreasonable to discuss any other arrangement. If, however, the scheme failed after being given a fair trial, it would be incumbent on our two Governments to devise something else. I assured him that it was the genuine desire of my Government to hand over eventually to the Iraq Government an efficient railway system, which was not over capitalised and which they could run for themselves with a minimum of foreign assistance as soon as Iraqis had been trained for the purpose. I felt sure that he would admit that the interests of his country demanded that the management of the railways should be in experienced hands throughout. We next discussed briefly the Port of Basra, in regard to the management of which Yasin Pasha had no serious objections to urge. I then asked him whether he had really said in Parliament that the existence of Royal Air Force units in Iraq was inconsistent with the country’s indepen dence. Yasin replied somewhat evasively that he had always held the view that the Treaty of 1930 did not confer complete independence on Iraq. He would not urge that complete independence was possible or even beneficial in the present circumstances, but it annoyed him to hear Iraqi statesmen—such as the late Prime Minister—affirm in public that Iraq was now completely independent. After I had explained to him. on the lines of my evidence before the Permanent Mandates Commission at Geneva, the reasons why the location of Royal Air Force units in Iraq was necessary in order to make possible the discharge of Great Britain's obligations under the alliance, I asked him straight out whether he preferred a treaty of alliance with us or an ordinary treaty of friendship. Yasin stated emphatically that a treaty of alliance was necessary for Iraq until she was strong enough to defend herself without foreign assistance. It would take many years for her to bring her army up to the required standard and, in the meantime, he would prefer an alliance with Great Britain to one with any other Power. He said that Great Britain's record in Iraq had been immeasurably more generous■ mmammmmm than any other Great Power would have accomplished, and that he himself, and his friends, were prepared to work in the closest co-operation with Great Britain for the further development of their country's interests. Knowing that Yasin Pasha had been closely associated with the idea of the Pan-Arab Congress. 1 warned him that it would he the duty of Iraqi statesmen in the years that lay ahead to turn their gaze inwards and to work for the I'egeneration of Iraq, rather than to mix themselves up in the affairs of then* neighbours. I felt that the best way of assisting their brothers in Syria was to make a success of the experiment of self-government in Iraq, whereas agitating against the French would only do harm. Yasin agreed that the new Cabinet should interest itself primarily with internal development, hut he added bitterly that, however good a model Iraq might prove for Syria, he was convinced that the French Government had no intention whatever of pursuing a liberal policy in that country. 1 concluded the interview by repeating that the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty must remain the basis of the relations between Great Britain and Iraq, and that I earnestly hoped that the new Cabinet, composed as it was of elements hitherto antagonistic, would make up their minds to work together without jealousy for the good of their country. Yasin thanked me for receiving him in such a friendly spirit and gave me his promise that he would work on the lines that I had indicated. He added, however, that he had taken office with great reluctance and was doubtful whether a Cabinet of strong-minded men belonging to different parties would be able to work harmoniously together for long. He said that he would ask to see me again privately, if things appeared to him to be going wrong.( 137 Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received April 10.) (No. 209.) Sir, Bagdad, March 30, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 181 of the 22nd March, I have the honour to enclose herewith the full text of the programme of the new Cabinet and a summary of the debate thereon which took place in the Chamber on the 27th March.(') 2. The programme contains no direct reference to the treaty of 1930, but the first item is clearly an attempt to produce a formula which can, as required, be held either to be a pledge to honour the treaty or an undertaking to satisfy the so-called national aspiration for greater freedom from British influence. When King Feisal, in the presence of his Minister for Foreign Affairs, first discussed with me the programme in draft, it contained a reference to the question of the amendment of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1930 which I held to be objectionable and damaging to Iraq’s reputation abroad. I was able to persuade the King that, in order to establish the credit of the new State in foreign countries, it would be necessary to create the impression abroad that Iraq was determined to honour her international obligations, and I finally prevailed upon him to omit any direct suggestion that the new Cabinet would work for the amendment of the treaty. I reminded His Majesty that it was largely on the strength of this treaty, which had been in force for less than six months, that Iraq had been admitted to membership of the League, and that it must continue to form the basis of Anglo-Iraqi relations. 3. The remaining political features of the programme call for little comment, but it may be noted that, instead of the ambiguous phrases regarding the strengthening of the country’s forces which have hitherto been employed by most Cabinets, conscription is this time openly included in the Government’s programme. I have repeated my warnings that so unpopular a measure can only be carried through successfuly if it is introduced gradually and with the utmost caution. 4. I am dealing with the chief economic and commercial features of the programme in a separate despatch, and I need only add that even the present Cabinet of all talents is unlikely to give effect to more than a small proportion of this long list of proposals, even if it remains in office for several years. I have, &amp;e. F. H. HUMPHRYS. Enclosure in No. 1. Programme of the New Cabinet. THE most important objects which the Cabinet will seek in the administration of State affairs are :*— (1) To strengthen the relations of friendship and amity with all foreign States; to respect international pledges; and to endeavour to realise the national aspirations and strengthen the structure of the State.

Amending the Tribal Regulations, and expediting the enactment of the Cultivators’ Obligations Law.

I said that I assumed that His Majesty had in mind to bring into the Cabinet members of the Opposition who were believed to be hostile to the policy followed not only by the present Government but by the Government of Nuri Pasha. It seemed to me that what the country required above all things was a rest from political strife and leisure to pursue a sound economic policy for its internal development. I reminded His Majesty that his previous efforts to eradicate criticism by giving office to Opposition leaders had led to disastrous results. These mixed Cabinets had been torn by internal jealousies, and had never succeeded in producing any constructive programme for the benefit of the country. I feared that it was inevitable that a similar fate would overtake any so-called national Cabinet which might b e formed at the present time, unless His Majesty was able to hold it together by his own unaided efforts. I could not conceive, for instance, that harmonious relations would long continue between Nuri Pasha and Yasin Pasha, or between either of them and the present Prime Minister, without some powerful overriding influence being continuously at work to bind them together. Moreover, the Opposition leaders had announced their uncompromising hostility/hostility to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, and were determined, so far as could be deduced from their public utterances, to agitate for the drastic amendment of its terms. I warned the King not to attempt such a dangerous experiment, unless he was assured of the genuine willingness of the political leaders to work together without jealousy to promote their country's interests and to observe loyally their treaty and other contractual obligations. 3. King Peisal agreed that the time for political agitation was definitely past. He said that the opposition of Yasin Pasha and his friends towards the treaty of 1930 had been based entirely on their personal hostility to Nuri Pasha. That hostility was now a thing of the past, and neither they, nor any other responsible Iraqi, wished to alter the terms of the existing alliance with Great Britain. He said that, when Parliament assembled on the 8th March, the Prime Minister would make a statement on the Government's policy, and, if, after this, Yasin Pasha or anyone else joined the Cabinet, it would be clear that they accepted the Prime Minister's programme. I need have no misgiving whatever concerning the treaty. As regards the possibility of friction among the members of a national Cabinet, His Majesty agreed that this was a real danger, against which he would have to take every precaution. The political leaders, however, had all placed themselves unreservedly in his hands, and had solemnly undertaken to be guided by his wishes. He felt convinced that the present political situation was singularly favourable to the formation of a national Cabinet of all the talents and he believed that, having/(m 3. having regard to the special economic problems which remained to be tackled, such a Government would be in the best interests of the country. He did not, however, consider the matter to be of immediate urgency, and he would seek a further opportunity for consulting me before taking any active steps. 4. I thanked His Majesty for having spoken to me with such frankness about the position of the Government, and assured him that I should always welcome an opportunity for exchanging views on these important matters. His Majesty would appreciate that I was not concerned with the personnel of the Cabinet so much as with the policy that it would be likely to adopt towards those questions in which my Government were particularly interested, and that, as a friend who had worked for the independence of Iraq, I was particularly anxious that the future record of the Government should be marked by sound constructive achievements(146 ^ [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] 15QHL-IBM. r~s i • s o ^ a J i... • J Decypher.

King Feisal lias expressed to me privately his dis- satisfaction with seme of the members of the present Cabinet and seems anxious to appoint a Ministry of all the talents. This would mean a combination of men of different political parties which in the past has led to jeu2ou^ r and discord. Such a Cabinet would probably include Nuri Pasha, Yasin Pasha, Rustam Haidar and Rashid All under the present Prime Minister if they could be persuaded to work together. The King has assured me that any Cabinet of his choice would be required to follow his policy of maintaining the closest relations with Great Britain and loyal observation of the Anglo- Iraq Treaty.COPY OF (W Notes.

Our interest in this question is rather indirect and we are not concerned with the internal manoeuvres in connection with the recent dissolution of the Iraqi Parliament and the resignation of Nuri. But Sir Hubert Young’s despatch of 3rd November (1060, on P.Z.7527) and the subsequent despatch of 17th November, (1093, on P.Z.7454/32) from Sir Francis Humphry's are of considerable interest in connection with the general attitude of Faisal and the policy he is likely to adopt now that Iraq has attained independent status. The King is anxious to remain in the centre of the stage 'and to assume the direction of affairs himself' and is impatient of/2. / of the advice of his ministers. Sir Hubert Young remarks at the same time that he has 'been successful during the past 10 years in maintaining connection with all shades of political opinion and that ’’while the methods adopted may have been open to criticism the results achieved have certainly justified them. The only doubt in my mind is whether he will be strong enough to resist the temptation of allowing the Treaty of 1930 to take the place of the Mandate Treaty of 1922 x as a pawn in his own political game”. Sir Francis Humphrys, however* sees ”no indication.•••.of his wishing to dispense with British help and guidance and I believe he is sincerely grateful for what we / Sir F.H. - P.Z. 7454, para.19. x P.Z.7527, para 15. have done for his throne and his country”. 2. The general advice given by H.M.Ambassador to the King, as recorded in Bagdad despatch of 17th November, is of interest. The only point which much concerns us is the proposed arrangement ror the future of the Shatt-el-Arab, discussed in paragraphs 12-15. It will be remembered that it was proposed to establish a Conservancy Board to deal with the Shatt—el-Arab and also with lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf, members of which should be Iraqi, British and Persian, and that discussions had reached an advanced stage. Here, as elsewhere, the temporary breakdown of the negotiations with Persia and the fall of Teymourtache, who had been very closely associated with the Conservancy Board discussions, are likely to result in considerable delay before any satisfactory arrangement can be reached.

HUMPHRYS DESPATCH TO SIR JOHN SIMON, (RECEIVED NOVEMBER 18). EASTERN (IRAQ). CONFIDENTIAL. (E.6230/9/93). BAG-DAD, November 17, 1932. 3. He began by renewing, in the most lavish terms, his thanks to His Majesty King George and to His Majesty’s Government for their unfailing help and guidance during the past years, which alone, he said, had enabled Iraq to obtain her independence through admission to the League of Nations. After thanking His Majesty for his generous appreciation of my country's help and referring to his own notable contribution to the work which had led to Iraq's successful apotheosis at Geneva, I observed that the emancipation of Iraq from mandatory control had naturally attracted wide attention. There were many who still thought that this had been done prematurely, and events in Iraq would now be watched very closely to see whether the confidence of His Majesty's Government in the fitness of the Iraqi nation for self-government was in fact well founded. I also pointed out that the future of Syria, in which I knew His Majesty was deeply interested, would depend in a large measure on events in Iraq. If all went well and Iraq justified the trust which had been placed in her, it would be much easier for Syria to make rapid progress along the road already traversed by Iraq. On the other hand, if the misgivings of the pessimists were realised and the termination of the mandate over Iraq were followed by disorders/3. the frontiers in the Shatt-al-Arab sector* 13. His Majesty had replied that he had thought this issue had already been settled in principle when Nuri Pasha haa discussed it with the Persian Minister of the Court during His Majesty’s visit to Tehran last spring, and he was surprised to learn that the Persian (xovernment wished to reopen the question of the sovereignty of these waters. It was, however, not a matter which he could discuss himself and no doubt the Minister would take it up with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs if he had been instructed to do so. 14. He then expressed to me the most serious apprehensions concerning the intentions of the Persian Government. He feared that they would make their demands in the Shatt-al-Arab a major political question and might even try to refer it to the League for settlement. He instanced their obstinacy in the matter of Bahrain and said that he felt that they would prove to be proportionately more difficult to deal with in a matter in which far greater interests were involved. For his part he felt that any limitation of Iraq’s compaete sovereignty over the waters of the Shatt-al-Arab was quite unthinkable and he hoped that His Majesty’s Government, in view of the Treaty of Alliance, would give their full support to Iraq in resisting all efforts of the Persian Government to seize part of this vital channel. He also informed me that Feroughi Khan, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, had intimated his desire for an audience in a few days’ time, when passing through Bagdad on his return from Geneva. He feared that Feroughi, too, would probably endeavour to discuss this issue. 15. I said that my advice to His Majesty was to hold the Persian Government to the arrangement for a Conservancy/4 Conservancy Board, which had been provisionally agreed on last spring. I had myself discussed the Shatt-al-Arab question when I was in Tehran prior to His Majesty^ own visit, and the r Minister of the Court, to whom I had explained the Conservancy Board proposals, had accepted the main principles of the scheme as satisfying the claims of the Persian Government. I assured His Majesty of my sympathy and support in safeguarding the vital interests of Iraq in any matter which concerned her strategic frontiers.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001a7_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2881A</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001a7</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2881A</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 17/20(1) 'Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930.
