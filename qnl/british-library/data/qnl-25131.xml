Signature of employer Signed, sealed, and delivered by the within-named in the presence ofwMiMLMmmio&amp;m Commissioner^ Office Berbera. 7th February, 1913. Sir, I have the honour to acknowleciga the receipt of your despatch No 4 of the 14th ultimo, regarding the proposed recruitment of Somalis for service in the East Africa protectorate. 2. Since the Native Labour Regulations, 1901, do not fully ,eet the special requirements of the case, I have considered it desirablejto legislate on the subject, and I enclose the draft of an Ordinance which it is pro posed to enact subject to your approval. 3. The clauses will, I think, largely explain themselves, and I need only draw attention to the following min points:- Clause 3. It is somewhat doubtful to me to what extent a law of this Protectorate can confer powers upon a magistrate in another British possession, but it is essential that Somali labourers in East Africa should be under the protection of the flov^mment, and I have therefore inserted this clause conferring upon the local authority somewhat wide powers to ensure the observance of the conditions of employment. Clause 4. is intended to prevent the separation of members of a family after their departure from the port of exit, which I think is desirable.

Sir, We, the undersigned, representing the coast planta tion interests of British East Africa have the honour to submit to you a proposal for utilizing the resources of Southern Arabia to supplement the East African labour supply which is at present inadequate to our needs. The rapid opening up of this colony during the past decade has led to an influx of settlers into the highland re gions, a great extension of public works, and the invest ment of a great deal of Capital in plantations in the coastal area of rubber,sisal cotton and, other tropical produce. This development has naturally caused a corres ponding increase in the demand for unskilled labour, so much so that the supply available, which is dependent largely on the native tribes of the interior being brought into close touch with the government, necessarily a grad ual process, has failed to keep pace with the demand for it; and though it is considered probable that the natives of the protectorate itself will eventually prove sufficient for all requirements, a severe shortage exists at the present time. Important government undertakings have had to be suspended in consequence. Several large planta tions are approaching the producing stage and unless Hv-C - vT; ° .sufficient labour is forthcoming to work them those who 14 DEC 1912 1 &gt;CE 10 COPY to INDIA ' '’‘'‘'““'““•‘&lt;11*14)..., 1 j SEGU E MHY'g NS,.^have invested their money will be involved in loss, further enterprise will be discouraged, and the prosperity of the colony is likely to suffer a severe check. This is a matter that affects all interests alike, but is of most immediate concern to the Coast planters, partly for the reason just stated, and partly because it is found that the natives from the high table land of the interior, on whom they mainly depend, do not always thrive in the trop ical regions near the coast. In these circumstances it has been decided to import la tourers for work on the coast if it can be done without prohibitive expense. It is hoped that this will tide over the present difficulty, and set free the up country natives for work in parts of the protectorate to which they are better adapted. Somaliland and S. Arabia seem the most promising recruiting grounds. We have already ap proached the Colonial Office with regard to the former and we now venture to hope that the assistance of the Indian Government will be forthcoming to enable us to do what we can on the Arabian Coast. The climatic conditions of the two places (S. Arabia and the E. African Coast) are not dissimalar; the distance separating them is not great, and Arabs from Shek^Tand Muscat are actually established in E. Africa and do well there. The objections, on ethnic grounds, that prohibit the introduction of Chinese into Africa do not apply in the case of Arabs or Somalis. We believe we can offer pay and conditions that will prove attractive: and that if labourers can be induced to come it will be to their and our mutual advantage.W© propose to recruit them on a contract of sufficient duration to ensure an adequate return in labour for the money we shall have to spend in bringing them down the coast, but there is no question of indenture. Pepatriation, at the employers expense, will be optional to them at the end of the stipulated time. Otherwise, if they are disposed to settle permanently and bring their families, we will provide them with land for cultivation. We can find em ployment on the estates for women and children as well as for grown men. If the Government of India will give Its support to the scheme we will undertake in all matters to consult the wishes of the Aden Authorities, and to refrain from recruit ing in Aden itself, or any other place where, owing to labour being required locally, or for other reasons, it is considered undesirable. Our plan, at present, is to get into touch with Merchants and others at points on the coast where labourers can be collected, and get the idea popular ised among the natives. We propose to send a representa tive to investigate the whole matter on the spot and if practicable to effect the necessary organization. As this matter is one of great importance and urgency to us we venture to hope that it may receive your early and favourable consideration. In order to obtain an answer in the shortest possible time we will gladly defray an3^ expenses your department majr incur in telegraphing to India or Aden on the subject. We have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient humble servants,[ Dear lourgh, W'ler htj) row-loft the Eant-African-DopaH- aiei^-and-tes paccod ycur^dcriy&lt;,ur~of tliu ~6tlr on to m enclose a copy of the correspondence v/hich has taken place as to getting labourers from Somaliland for the coast plantations in the East Africa Protectorate. No objection in principle is seen either here or by the Commissioner in Somaliland, but we have still to hear whether the terns proposed are acceptable to the planters and whether the Governor of the East Africa Protectorate is prepared to agree to the experiment. The three people you mention are all connected with rubber or fibre companies in the coast strip - Lord Card•‘'•oss with the Gazi Rubber and Pibre Estates, ;.:r Powys Cobb with the Powyslarid Plantations, British East Africa, and Nr Waveil with the Nyali Sisal Estate . You httchburgh,You will notice that they all signed the letter about the Somaliland scheme, and they, with a number of* others all representative of leading unofficial employers, have memorialised the Secretary of State on the general ques tion of the scarcity of labour in the East Africa Protec- torate. &gt; Harcourt is to receive a deputation on the subject - probably on the 17th. The dearth of labour is being inquired into by a local Commission. There is no doubt that both Govern ment and planters are feeling the effects of it, and although outside labour may prove not to be the only or even the best solution of the difficulty we do not see why it should no+- be considered if proper conditions can be obtained. As regards the Aden proposal, you will no doubt in any case wish to wait for the decision on the Somaliland proposal, but we should be glad if you could find out in the meantime what the local objections are.MidfP i aafea . i I U 19 ! 2 The Under Secretary cf State, Colonial Office, S.W. lid Regent Street, London, S.W. 2~f k ? Afc*. fjl^ Sir, SOMAL I LABOUR. We have the honour to submit for your appro val a suggestion that the labour resources of Somaliland might be employed to supplement the present great defi ciency of unskilled native labour on the Coast Plan tations of the East Africa Protectorate. Ac the present time several large properties are approaching the pro ducing stage, and unless an adequate supply oi labour is immediately forthcoming very great losses will be incurred by those who have invested in Coast enterprises and a corresponding set back to the prosperity cl tne East African Colony will be the result. We have heard on what we believe to oe good authority that there are in Berbera many homeless Somali natives, agriculturists from tne mills of the Hinterland who are at present without work or means of livelihood. We sugg st that these might well be trans ferred to the British East African Coast oo cur mutual advantage. The climatic conditions are approximately similar, and work can be given to ohs women and children as well as grown men in conditions and at a rate of payment which we believe would be attractive to them. Before embarking on the expense of sending a representative to effect the collecting of the number wewq propose to take. As the matter is one of great urgency to us we hope that it will receive your early and favourable consideration. We are prepared to defray whatever ex pense your department may incur in cabling to the 8 cma1i1and Autho ritie s. We have &amp;c., (Sgd.)
