Dat-jd 29th (reed. 30th) September 1934. , From Secretary of State for India, London; To Viceroy (F. &amp; P. Department) Simla. (Ropuatad to Political Residont, Bushiro, No.2305). Ploaso saa racord of conversations during Sir A. Ryan’s visit to Taif, July 12th - 14th July, copy of v/hich was onclosad v/ith my Political Secretary’s latter of 30th August 1934, No.P.Z.5549/34. 2. It is probable that on Ryan’s rotilrn to Jodda ha will enter on negotiations in an endeavour to secure an arrangement by v/hich all major outstanding questions between Saudi Government and His Ilajesty’s Government could be settled to mutual satisfaction and friendship between the two Powers could be publicly reaffirmed. Certain preliminary discussions have taken place v/ith Fuad Hamza in London, 3. One desideratum of Ibn Baud, to v/hich he attaches utmost importance, is to secure modification of attitude hitherto adopted by His Majesty’s Government that Blue Line of Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 — necessarily constitutes eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. Foreign Office are now advised that while these Conventions and Ibn Baud’s position as successor, to Turkey gives us a bargaining asset of some value , nevertheless territory to east of Blue Line, so far as it cannot be claimed for Trucial Shaikhs or Muscat, is a Res Nullius in which Ibn Saud is untitled to acquire rights by occupation or proscriptionAT © prescription. In any case, it is a matter of great political impor tance not to alloy/ prospects of a goaoral settlement which would be of advantage to His Majesty’s Government to break down over question of Blue Line, It has, therefore, been decided that in Ryan’s negotiations whole question of eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia should be discussed y/ithout pre-conditions and that, as part of a new general settlement giving His Majesty’s Government their main desiderata in other directions, His Majesty's Government should be pre pared to make concessions in regard to eastern limits cf Saudi Arabia as generous as is consistent with their own strategic and other requirements in Eastern Arabia and legitimate claims of Truoial Lhaikhs and Sultan of Muscat. 4. Defence Departments of His Majesty's Government will be consulted regarding strategic ^ requirements. In the meantime, as a first step towards consideration of nature and extent of concessions which might be offered, I should be glad if Political Resident in the Persian Gulf could let me have as expeditiously as may be possible information on the follov/ing questions, (1) What are the existing boundaries inter so cf each Truoial Cheikhdom and Muscat ? It is desirable to ascertain whether information in Lorimer v s is up to date. (2) What are regarded as boundaries, if any, of Truoial Sheikhdoms and Muscat towards hinterland, or what is extent of claim of Sheikh and Sultan dn,reopect of Sovereignty payment cf Zakat, or control of, or influence over, trioes in the direction of the hinterland ? In the case cf Muscat the landward extent cf Sultan's control and influence should, if possible, be stated right round to the point where his coast line joins that cf Hadramaait.3273. f - 3 - (3) ViTiat are views cf Folitical Resident as to degree to v/hich such claime are justifiable and ought to be supported either in our own interests or in legitimate interests cf Rulers concerned ? 5. Information under (1) above is desirable because it is, of course, clear that whatever concessions in hinterland might be offered it would be contrary to our political and ether interests to allow Ibn Saud tc extend his dominions to the Coast anywhere east cf Qatr and Hadramatit * It is, therefore, necessary to make sure whether or not there are any unclaimed gaps of territory on the coast between boundaries of various States. Co far as Coast is concerned the only possible concessions would appear tc be territory between Blue Line and head of Debates Salwa* It is possible that it may be decided that any concessions to Ibn baud in hinterland should be based on a tribal rather than on a strict geographical basis this would mean that, instead of defining on map the frontier of a salient of territory stretching eastwards from Blue Line, it might be found preferable merely to acknowledge that Ibn baud's authority extended over certain tribes living in hinterland. In collecting information requested above lolitiral Resident should therefore give particular attention tc habitats and allegiances of various tribes, both settled and migratory, for example, in the case of each ruler if should be stated what tribes, or sections of tribes, are settled in area controlled by ruler and what migratory tribes or sections visit such area. It appears that Ibn baud is particularly interested in the question of Hurra and Manasir.( con ) L/C eliy l'ik , Lu^le* I3S I /W No* C /232 of 1934 Political Agency &amp; H*B.M’s Consulate Muscat, 23rd October 1934* ?rom: Major C.

IMMEDIATE. INDIA OFEICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W.l 12th January 1935. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the correspondence noted in the margin, copies of which have already been sent to the Foreign Office and the other interested ~ ) Departments on the subject better from Political Agent,Bahrein , ) dated 12th December 1934. ) of the position to the East Telegram to Government of India, ) No.3023, dated 19th December 1934.) of the Blue Line laid down Telegram from Resident, T/186, dated 21st December 1934.

Telegram from Government of India, No.3, dated 2nd January 1935. in the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913/14 and the attitude to be adopted in discussions with King Ibn Saud as to possible modiflcatiais ) of that line. 2. The valuable report contained in Colonel Loch’s letter of 12th December, C.963-la/38, shows the present position, so far as can be ascertained, in the northern part of the area in question. From that report it appears: (a) that the Sheikh of Qatar regards a line running roughly from Salwa to the head of the Khor al Odeid as his southern boundary. Such a line is practically identical with that which has been recognised in the past by His Majesty’s Government as the southern boundary of the Sheikh’s territories (conpare India Office memorandum P. Z. 614/34: B. 430) , and it corresponds closely (save at Sakak) with the limit/ The Under Secretary of State Foreign Office.IT /N limit which has been accepted by His Majesty’s Government for the guarantee of protection which tney were prepared to give the Sheikh in tne event of his granting an oil concession in his State to a company approved by them. The statements made by the Sheikh of .Abu Dhabi and his uncle as to the Western limits of the territory of Abu Dhabi are also sufficiently consistent with the acceptance of this line; (b) that the coast between Q,atar and the tip of the Musandim Peninsula definitelj^ belongs to one or other of the Trucial Sheikhs; (c) that east of the Blue Line, Ibn Saud is locally regarded as holding the territory west of a line running Sakak-Mabak-Jabrin and in particular as holding Sakak and Mabak, where the Al Murra, 'v/ho are generally regarded as under Ibn Saud' , have had settlements for the last 12 years; (d) that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi is not prepared to commit himself as to sovereignty in the area lying between the line Sakak-Mabak-Jabrin referred to in (c) and the western boundaries of Abu Dhabi described in (e) below. While Jabrin lies well to the west of the Blue Line, any negotiations with Ibn Saud in which His Majesty’s Government take their stand on the Blue Line must, of course, proceed on the basis that all territory lying to the west of that line is in the undoubted sovereignty of Ibn Saud; (e) that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi himself claims not only Aqal and the Sabhakhah al Matti with its hinterland as far as Al Rimal, but the whole of the hinterland to the east of the Sabhakhah al Matti as far as/ /‘r3. / * • /S /•N as Baraimi. It may be noted that His Majesty’s Government have in the past formally recognised both the Sabhakhah al Matti and Aqal (with the Xhor-al-Odeid) as forming part of the territories of Abu Dhabi (compare the Appendix to India Office memorandum P.Z. 614/34; B.430). From the note on page 262 of Mr.Thomas’s 'Arabia Felix' it appears that the Northern boundary of Al Bimal in the region 51^ East longitude may be fixed at Banaiyan. While to the east of that point the Sands continue northwards to the shores of the Persian Gulf, this area is not, according to Mr.Thanas, regarded as Al Rimal by those best acquainted with the Sands. The Sheikh admits that within the area between the Sabhakhah al Matti and Baraimi zakat has in recent years been from time to time collected from certain tribes on behalf of Ibn Saud. But it seems clear that in the case of the Bani Yas he has acquiesced in such payment only under protest and that there are special circumstances in the case of the Manasir. It seems unnecessary to attach any special importance to payments made to some extent in special circumstances by certain sub-sections of the seven tribes living in the neighbourhood of Baraimi, and the important point is that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi not only claims, but appears effectively to exercise a degree of jurisdiction in the hinterland, particularly in the Dhafrah and Liwa areas and as far East as Baraimi. (f) that despite the activities of his zakat collectors, there is nothing to show that Ibn Saud has/mam 4. has ever established prescriptive rights of suzerainty, r\ much less of sovereignty, over any part of the Trucial Coast between the Sabhakhah al Katti and Baraimi. 3. The question of the boundary in the south western area is primarily one for the Colonial Office. The Secretary of State notes, however, from Sir Bernard Reilly’s despatches to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Ho.263 of 3rd October and Ho.296 of 14th November 1934, that the Resident is of opinion that, subject to the result of further enquiries which are being made locally, it would be desirable to claim the edge of the Sands as the northern boundary of the Hadramaut and to include in the Aden Protectorate on strategic as well as on political grounds all territory lying to the south of the -Empty Quarter and to the west of the boundaries of the Sultan of Muscat. 4. The information which has been collected places His Majesty’s Government in a position to reach certain conclusions a,s to the maximum concessions in the area to the east of the Blue Line of the 1913/14 Conventions which could be made to Ibn Saud in return for a satisfactory settlement of the other points outstanding between the King and His Majesty’s Government. The Secretary of State agrees with the Government of India that the main objectives of His Majesty’s Government are: authority to the coast south of Qatar or acquiring further influence over the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Trucial Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government; (a) to prevent Ibn Saud from extending his (t)/5. (b) to prevent so far as possible tiie desert area adjoining the territory of those Sheikhs from being exploited under the aegis of Ibn Baud by foreign companies for oil or minerals. 5. The geographical limits to be set to any concession to be made are examined in greater detail below. The first question for consideration is whether His Majesty's Government should aim at a settlement on the basis of: (a) a frontier based on tribal divisions; or (b) an arrangement providing for definite territorial limits to the dominions of Ibn Saud on the one hand and of the proteges of His Majesty's Government on the other. 6. The Secretary of State, like the Government of India, is much attracted by the suggestion of a frontier based on tribal divisions such as is recommended by Colonel Fowls and supported both by Colonel Dickson, whose great experience of Arabia must carry weight in a connection such as the present, and by the observations recorded by Mr.Bertram Thomas. He agrees with the Resident that there is much to be said against a geographical frontier laid down in a desert, and in practice an arbitrary line in a desolate area, sparsely peopled by a nomadic and primitive population, is open to many objections. But on a review of the position as a whole and in the light of the information now available, he agrees with the Government of India, that, for the reasons given in their telegram of 27th December, such a solution would not appear best calculated to achieve the main/Is\ \ i V i \ jT\ A r\ r* r. • 1 @ 6 . main objectives referred to in paragraph 4 aoove. He is apprehensive, too, that were His Majesty’s Government in discussion with Ibn Saud to aim at a frontier Cased on tribal divisions, they might find it difficult, in the light of the information received from Colonel Loch as to the payment of zakat to Ibn Saud oy individjal tribes or sub-sections of tribes, to establish, the position Ox their Arab clients as conclusively as tney would wisn, or to dispose effectively of Saudi claims which they might regard as devoid of any real foundation. 7. In these circumstances the Secretary oi State feels that His Majesty’s Government have no option but to aim at a settlement on the basis of territorial boundaries. The main alternative solutions on this hypothesis are. (a) a relatively small territorial concession to Ibn Saud immediately to the east of the Blue Line. ihis concession might or might not be subject to the 'servitude' that no mineral or other concessions would be granted within it by Ibn Saud, save after consultation with Kis Majesty’s Government and to a group approved both by His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government; (b) in addition to (a) the establishment of a desert zone, (within which neither Ibn Saud nor His Majesty’s Government would exercise any territorial sovereignty or grant any concessions) on the general lines put forward in Mr.Rendel’s letter to Mr.Laithwaite of 7th November 1934; (c) in addition to (a) the cession to Ibn Saud in full sovereignty, either personal or territorial, but subject to the servitude referred to in (a), of a further area, much more restricted in size than the desert zone referred t o in (b). 8. The Secretary of State has closely examined the alternatives/alternatives discussed in the preceding paragraph, he is strongly of opinion that it is desirable from all points of view to reach a reasonable settlement of the matters now in issue and he agrees with the Government of India that, given the element of uncertainty as to the legal position of the Blue Line and the unquestioned, even though somewhat vague and precarious, influence exercised in certain areas to the east of it at the present time by Ibn Saud , it would be well worth making sane concession to the King in return for an agreed limitation of his encroachments and a formal and binding agreement which would delimit the spheres of influence or control of the ruler of Saudi Arabia on the one hand and of His Majesty’s Government and their protege's on the other. But he considers (and he trusts that Sir John Simon will agree with him) that His Majesty’s Government should in the negotiations make the fullest play with the general strength of their position. He notes in particular the statement made by Sir A.Ryan in the Middle Bast Committee, which has carried much weight with him , that ”Ibn Saud was less impressed by legal considerations than by fear of His Majesty’s Government and anxiety lest they should use their power to compel him to accept the Blue Line”, and in forming his conclusions he has not overlooked the indications available to His Majesty’s Government that the Saudi Government, strongly as they may feel about the Blue Line, do not feel entirely certain of their position in a dispute on this question with His Majesty’s Government.8. O 0\ / AJ © /'“S /s 9. The Secretary of State suggests in these circumstances that Kis Majesty’s Minister might open his negotiations on the basis of a relatively small concession to Saudi Arabia immediately to the east of the Slue Line. The Government of India would be prepared to go as far as the line Sakak-' abak, which corresponds to the area within which Ibn Saud exercises sovereignty, and possibly also (cf.their telegram of 3rd January) to cede a strip of territory running to the 20th parallel of latitude. Subject to the views of the Service Departments the Secretary of State would be prepared to recognise Saudi sovereignty within an area east of the Blue Line, bounded on the north by a line running from the head of the Dohat-as-Salwa to a point slightly to the south-east of Sakak, but leaving Sakak to Saudi Arabia; on the east by a line running fran the extremity of the northern boundary just described by the north-western extremity of Aqal (Lorimer, II: 88/9) due south via, but west of Banaiyan, to the 2Cth parallel of latitude in the Rub’al Kali. Sir Samuel Hoare recognises that this would involve the abandonment of Sakak to Saudi Arabia, the acceptance of Saudi sovereignty up to the frontier of Qatar, and the attribution to Ibn Saud of the area between the line Sakak-Mabak-Slue Line and the western limits of Abu Dhabi to which his claim is at least doubtful. The latter area appears to be desert and of little real importance. The position is different as regards Sakak/Sakak. The Air Council have in the past made it clear that they regard it as most important that this place should be regarded as falling within the dominions of Qatar, so that it should be open to His Majesty’s Government to make use of it in connection with the protection which it is proposed to give to the Sheikh of Qatar in the event of his granting an oil concession to a company approved by His Majesty’s Government, and that they should be at liberty if necessary to pursue raiders across the Qatar protection limit. The strategic considerations involved in any relinquishment of Sakak to the King of Saudi Arabia are primarily matters for the Service Departments, who will no doubt independently express their views upon them. Subject to those views the Secretary of State is at this moment content to say that, while he recognises the desirability of including Sakak in the territories of a ruler under our control or in special treaty relations with us, he feels that the confirmation now received from the Gulf that Sakak and Mabak are locally regarded as being under Saudi control and that the A1 Murra, who are in close relation with Ibn Saud, have been established at these points for at least 12 years, coupled with the information previously received as to the existence of Ikhwan colonies there, materially alters the position. He is in these circumstances disposed to think that the10 . ■l * potential inconvenience to which His Majesty’s Government may 'be subjected in connection with the grant of protection to Q,atar were Sakak to fall outside its limits would on the whole, from the political point of view, be a relatively small price to pay were it possible in return to secure the limitation of Ibn Baud’s encroachments elsewhere in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast. This is more particularly the case as it should be possible to demand retribution from Ibn Baud in the event of raids across the Qatar boundary frcm territory formally recognised as appertaining to him. Within any area so conceded the Secretary of State would on the whole be disposed to agree to the full exercise of sovereignty, including the right to grant concessions without prior consultation with His Majesty’s Government, by Ibn Baud. 10. If there seems no prospect of any settlement in return merely for the concessions discussed in the preceding paragraph His Majesty’s Minister might then be authorised to offer a settlement on the broad general lines suggested in Mr.Rendel’s letter, S.6769/279/91 of 7th November 1934, to Mr.Laithwaite. Under such a settlement, in addition to the territorial concessions to Ibn Baud/ — _11 . Saud in the country immediately to the east of the Blue Line referred to in paragraph 9, a special Desert Zone would be created, within which rights would be personal but not territorial. Within this zone neither Ibn Saud nor His Majesty’s Government (acting on behalf of their proteges) would possess any exclusive territorial rights and His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud alike would renounce certain rights or claims, particularly in regard to such acts of territorial sovereignty as the granting of concessions and the establishment of permanent fortifications. Both parties would further undertake not to raise objections to the passage of each other's aircraft. The Desert Zone would be subject to a special Desert regime to last in the first instance for a period of say, 10-20 years, subject to reconsideration at the end of that time a,t the instance of either of the High Contracting Parties. The regime would be so devised as to enable Ibn Saud to maintain any personal rights at present effectively exercised by him over the nomadic tribes/ 1i m 0 » 12 . n ys A * V.'tf tribes, such as the right to levy zakat. The Desert Zone would be established and the desert regime regulated by a formal agreement between the two High Contracting Parties. 11. The boundaries of any such Desert Zone might be defined by a line closely resembling that tentatively suggested in Mr.Rendel’s letter of 7th November 1934, referred to above. Such a line would run frcm a point immediately south of the Dells of Banaiyan east-south-east to the intersection of Meridian 55 and Parallel 22; thence due south to the intersection of Meridian 55 and Parallel 20; thence (subject to the further observations of the Resident at Aden and the Secretary of State for the Colonies) along the edge of the Southern Sands to a point a given number of miles due north of Tarim in the Wadi Hadramaut; fran which point it would rejoin the boundary of the territory to be recognised as belonging to Ibn Saud in full sovereignty. 12. Boundaries/wwmmm* » *r 13. iX' @ 12. Boundaries such as those suggested for the Desert Zone would represent a generous concession to Saudi aspirations. It will he remembered that Mr. Philby, despite his special relations with the King and the fact that he was travelling under the protection of Ibn Jiluwi and with guides provided by him, never penetrated east of the 52nd Meridian or south of the ISth parallel; and Mr. Bertram Thomas, in conversation, has not taken a serious view of Saudi claims or influence outside those limits. But on the assumption that the Desert regime would be merely one of renunciation of exclusive rights and that its establishment would therefore be without prejudice to the rights in it of the Sultan of Muscat Or the Trucial Sheikhs, the Secretary of State, in the interests of a friendly general settlement, and on the understanding that the fullest play would be made with the concession represented, would be prepared to agree to the boundaries in question. A Desert Zone so defined, and to the east, north and south of which all claims of any description were relinquished by Ibn Saud (His Majesty's Government for their part relinquishing claims on behalf of their prot6g4s to the area lying to the west of it), would have the effect of keeping Saudi pretensions well away from the coast. ihe belt of territory between the boundary of the Desert Zone cmd the sea coast would moreover be sufficiently deep to make it possible for His Majesty's Government, should any question arise in future of granting oil concessions m the Trucial Sheikhdoms or in Muscat, to fix a limit for such concessions which would leave between that limit and the border of the Desert Zone an ai ea within w.iic the/15. within that area no concessions would he granted oy Ibn ^ Saud, save after consultation with His Majesty's Government, and to a group approved both by His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government. The further area in question might roughly be contained in a rectangle running from a point due south of Banaiyan to the 20th Parallel of Latitude; thence due east to the point marked as Gardam on Mr. Bertram Thomas’s map;, thence due north to meet a line running due east from Banaiyan. Having regard to the uncertainty as to the Saudi position in the Central Desert and to the facts stated in paragraph 12 above, he does not consider oLat if there is to be any question of conceding territorial sovereignty to Ibn Saud any more extensive concession could be justified. The concessions suggested in this letter, and that now suggested in particular, are in fact substantially more generous than that recommended either by the Political Resident or the Government of India; and the Secretary of State feels justified in suggesting /“X them only because of the great difficulties likely ~o -v be experienced in any exploitation of this area and the desirability of a general settlement, 15. In conclusion, I am to say that while the Secretary of State’s views as to the maximum concessions v/hich could be made by His Majesty's Government and the order of priority in which they should be considered are as set out above, he, like the Government of India, entirely agrees with Colonel Powle that 'before maxing any definite proposals to Ibn Saud', His Majesty’s Government should 'extract from him a detailed statement of his claim east of present Blue Line and thus get hi2£ to/As Sir to put his cards on the table before we do”. John Simon is aware, incidental information goes suggest that the Saudi Government are in considerable doubt as to the limits within which they should claim jurisdiction to the east of the jlue Line. .Lis Majesty’s Government, in the Secretary of State’s view, are in a strong bargaining position and he things it desirable, given the importance of the issues under consideration, that the fullest possible use s.-ould oe made of this. 16. Sir Samuel Hoare recognises that detailed consideration of the matters now under examination may take some little time and he is aware that r.is Majesty’s Minister, in view of the possibility that he may in the near future have to interview Ibn Saud personally, is pressing for instructions. Ke would suggest in these circumstances that if it is impossible in the course ox the next fev; days to reach agreement as to the detailed instructions to be sent to the Minister, Sir A» hyan should be informed that instructions will be sent at the earliest possible date and advised for the moment to concentrate, in any discussions into which he may be obliged to enter, on obtaining a clearer indication than has hitherto been afforded of Ibn Saud’s desiderata. If the King repeats that he lays claim to the desert as distinct from the coastal tracts, it would, in Sir Samuel Hoare’s view, be desirable, at any rate as a first move, to take the line that His Majesty’s Government could not consider anything so extensive or so vaguely expressed and that while they are prepared, in the interests of friendly relations, to make some concession to Ibn Saud, they must insist that it shall be on reasonable lines. It would, in his view, go far to prejudice/17.

Reference is made to the 'blue line', which was laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914, and the file discusses the approach that should be taken in discussions with Ibn Saud regarding possible modifications of that line.The file contains a copy of a telegram from the Secretary of State for India to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (forwarded by the Political Resident to the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat), dated 29 September 1934, which provides some background to the Anglo-Saudi boundary dispute and requests information regarding the existing boundaries of each Trucial Sheikhdom [Shaikhdom] and of Muscat. The Political Agent's reply to the forwarded telegram, dated 23 October 1934, provides an outline of what the Sultan of Muscat [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] considers to be the boundaries of his Sultanate.Also included in the file are a copy of a letter received by the Colonial Office from the Political Resident at Aden, discussing the eastern boundary of the Aden Protectorate, and a copy of a letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office, which extensively discusses the issue of Saudi Arabia's eastern frontier and the available policy options. One question marked for consideration is whether the British should aim for a settlement which provides 'definite territorial limits' of the frontiers, or one which defines the frontiers based on tribal divisions.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000380#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
