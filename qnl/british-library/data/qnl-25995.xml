Position is that Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have themselves 1100 tons of barley and United Kingdom Commercial Corporation reserves of tvheat in Abadan at the end of September will be 2,903 tons. Thus even if the Anglo-iranian Oil Company fail to buy a single ton locally there are still sufficient reserves available (group unae c: ) for some time to come.

XXX IMDIV . 30?*^ Following for your information is the position regarding wheat supplies to Persia and Iraq- Iraq's arrival requirements are at least 25,000 tons during the four months January to April. Persian requirements are 13,000 tons monthly but to relieve strain on inland clearance Bullard agreed to a temporary reduction to 8,000 tons monthly. We are now aiming at following arrival programme for Persia- January 8000 February 8000 March 11-000 April 12,000 Total 39,000 tons. Imports via Nokkundi would be additional. Arrivals in Persian Gulf are being allocated by Basra War Transport Committee between Iraq and Persia within these programmes according to convenience of discharge-, 2. The above is our target but it is doubtful if shipping to meet it in full can bo found- Shipments from America depend on number of ships put in for military cargoes for Persian Gulf ports and the nature of those cargoes. At present largo consignments of heavy pipes provide most of necessary deadweight cargo and there is little space for wheat. Thus against 20,000 tons in February and 8,000 tons in first half of March which should be loaded in America to meet programme in paragraph 1, it seems likely at present that only 14 r 000 tons will be loaded over both periods. It is impossible to say how long this situation may continue. 3* 3,000 tons of U.KoC.C, ; s stocks in India are being reserved for Nokkundi route (vide your telegram 948 of 7th February). Basra War Transport Committee have been told that the balance of those stocks which arc about 4800 tons should be allocated so far as possible to Iraq in order to rod. Iraq's imports of dollar wheat. Persia will pay dollars for North American wheat- Apart from this wo have assumed that no exports from India will be possible- 4. Russian trade representative London has boon asked to investigate possibility of sending wheat to Persia from Russia. Copy to ; P.A.Wilson (W.C.0.) W. J, Arkcll (M.W. T.) E. Jago (U.K.C.C.)
