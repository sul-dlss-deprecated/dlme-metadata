In continuation of correspondence ending with my confidential letter No. 122, dated 17th May 1915, to your address, I have the honour to submit the following report on affairs connected with the “ Imam’s rising 2. When my last report on this subject was submitted, the position was briefly as follows :— A circular letter had, with your approval, been addressed* to the Imam, • Vide 'enclosure to this office letter No. 100 , Shaikhs Hamyar and Isa bin Saleh, the dated the i^th April iyi5. rebel leaders, expressing our desire to see friendly relations between themselves and His Highness the Sultan restored and offering our intervention in the cause of peace. To this communication replies had been received from the Imam and + videi\ivi office letter No. 114 , dated the 29th Shaikh Hamyai only. That of Shaikh April i9i6. Isa bin Saleh was then still awaited.f The Imam in acknowledging my letter represented the necessity of referring the proposals it contained to the religious leaders of the people whose views he promised to obtain and forward in due course. Shaikh Hamyar suggested the advisability of our sending a representative into the interior to discuss matters. Neither writer expressed any satisfaction at or even approval of our friendly offer. 3. Since then a reply, purporting to be from Shaikh Isa bin Saleh, has been received. We have also received various reports from the interior show ing the nature of the reception accorded to my circular letter and indicating the general feeling of the people with regard to it; while we have at the same time been able to obtain indirectly an insight into the main grievances of the rebels and the probable nature of the demands that they will make. In this connection 1 attach copies of four (as being the most interesting and ^, r&gt; „ ^ representative^) of the numerous letters received from and statements made by informants from the interior. They tend to throw considerable light also on. the general condition of affairs in Oman. 4. A translation of the reply received from Shaikh Isa bin Saleh is attached. (Enclosure “ A” ). The letter was delivered to me by a messenger of the Imam to whom it seems to have been sent under “ flying seal’ by Shaikh Isa. It is neither signed nor sealed ; nor is it in the handwriting of Shaikh Isa bin Saleh. Rut from the statement§ of the informant, Hamad bin Sayad, there seems little reason to doubt that its author is any other than Shaikh Isa bin Saleh. The letter is friendly in tone and indicates a desire to open negotiations.s No reply lias yet been sent to it, partly because of the anonymous nature of the communication, but mainly because it would seem more appropriate to await the further communication promised by the chief leader of the rebels, the Imam himself, which should embody both his own views and those of ail his following. . t a\ His Highness the Sultan has also received a friendly letter from Shaikh Isa bin Saleh in which he informs him of the despatch of a messenger, one Abdulla bin Haned, to interview His Highness. 5. With regard to the reception accorded to my circular letter by the inhabitants of the interior, reports received are contradictory. In some quarters onr motive was deliberately misrepresented and our offer of intervention m the cause of peace was construed to indicate “weakness and a desne on our part to find an excuse to set free the British troops quartered at Maskat which, it was represented, were urgently required for service m Persia where trouble was also said to be brewing. In this connection a reference o o statement of the informant Haji Abdulla Bastaki, a resident of Wadi Maawal, is invited (Enclosure “ C ”). This man’s statement, it will be observed also indicates the existence of German influence in the interior and it would not he unreasonable to attribute the unfriendly attitude of the.Omani people now evinced towards our friendly offer to this cause. The existence of German agents in the interior is also corroborated by the letter (Enclosure B ) addressed to me by a Kazi of Sur, Mahomad bin Ahmad, and by the statement of Nasar bin Suleiman attached herewith (Enclosure “ D ). On the other hand, the letter of Shaikh Isa bin Saleh and the information, obtained during the visit to me of Hamad bin Sayad (Enclosure “ E ”) indicate a more friendly attitude. They clearly betray-whatever the Imam may have caused to be publicly announced to the contrary an inclination on the part of the people and of at least one of the rebel leaders to welcome the opportunity of our intervention with a view to an amicable settlement. 6. The views, grievances, expectations and probable demands of the rebels as elicited in the course of an interview with Hamad bin Sayad are lecorded in the memorandum attached at Enclosure “ E”. While too much import ance cannot be attached to this man’s statements—as, by his own showing, he was in no way authorised to speak on behalf of the rebel leaders yet his views and opinions reflecting, as they probably do, those of the Imam and Shaikh Isa, are important and have therefore been considered deserving of official record. There is little doubt that he had been sent by the rebels to ascertain to what extent their demands were likely to be accepted. He showed much anxiety to obtain information with regard to these demands and begged to be entrusted with a reply to take back to i the people of Oman . lie was informed that no details could be discussed except with a duly authorised representative sent by the Imam and that as he was not in possession of any credentials, any such discussion with him w r as out of the question. He was, however, informed in a general w T ay what demands it would pro-* bably be unwise for the rebels to include in any statement that they might feel disposed to submit in due course. These will also be found embodied in the memorandum at Enclosure “ E ’\ He was also assured that any representa tions made in the proper way would receive our sympathetic consideration. The man left Maskat for Awabi, where the Imam is now residing, on the 4th June. He promised to return “ with further information ” in due course, and hinted that a statement of such of the rebel demands as lay in our power to o-rant would be submitted to me direct and that others, affecting the Sultan only, would be sent to His Highness; but that a copy of the latter would also he sent to me anonymously for information. His Highness was informed by me at once of the purport of my interview with this man. His Highness entirely approved of the action taken and of the reply given to Hamad bin Sayad. The Sultan’s view is that while a few ot the more intelligent people may possibly desire a leconciliation, the religious element, headed, by the Imam, who are still engaged in preaching a jehad, are opposed to peace and will exercise their superior influence to render all efforts at an amicable settlement abortive. In any case His Highness ia3 convinced that the rebels will never surrender the Samail valley, for which His Highness intends to hold out as a first condition of peace, except under force of arms. 7. Of the movements of the rebels in the interior there is little to record. For several months they have shown no activity there, nor are there any signs of nny desire on their part to renew combined hostilities. Small bands of raiders have given trouble in the vicinity of the military picquets and have on two occasions succeeded in carrying off herds of goats belonging to the garrison. - They have also looted cattle from the coast village of Rautha, while quite recently a somewhat serious encounter took place between the Sultan’s troops and Beni Battash at Kuaryat. On the 4th June the military picquets engaged a small party of about 40 raiders near the Kurram village and reported that they had killed or wounded two of the enemy. There were no casualties among the troops. H. M. S. Dalhousie,” when not required for duty on the Mekran Coast, has been stationed in Maskat waters and her presence here has undoubtedly had a deterrent effect on the inhabitants of the interior. Tiie progress of the war is watched with much interest locally. The general feeling in the interior would appear to be entirely pro-German. In Maskat it is the same but to a very much less extent. Distorted accounts of the war and anti-British propaganda have undoubtedly been circulated in the interior, but His Highness has loyally co-operated with this Agency in indenti- fying offenders. Several arrests of suspected persons have been made and severe punishment has been meted out by His Highness in each case. These vigorous measures are having a very salutary effect. 8. A copy of this report is being sent, for information, to the Hon’ble the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. Enclosure “ A.” Translation of an Arabic letter from Isa bin Saleh to the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, dated the 28rd Jamadi II 1333= 11th May 1915. • After compliments .—Peace be to him who follows the righteous. I have received your letter and understood its contents, namely, that you express regret that differences should exist between the Ruler and the people of the interior and that the British Government love peace and harmony. This (of course) is desired by every man of sense. But you have not explained the means whereby you propose to bring about a reconciliation. So please do this that we may consider the matter and, God willing, we will give you our answer thereto. I only received your letter a few days ago and some words of it I did not understand. And our reply for the Imam is, May Almighty keep him, etc. Enclosure “ B Translation of a letter in Arabic from Muhammad bin Ahmed at Sur, to the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, d; ted the 1st Kajab 1333= 18th May 1915. After compliments .—I have the honour to inform you that I have reached my native place, Sur, and herewith send you a report as you instructed me, regarding the names of certain individuals, German subjects, who last year arrived at Sur, and passed on into the interior of Oman. The following are the names of these persons and I have obtained them from the records of the Customs Superintendent at Sur. Probably some of these are German spies; we may perhaps presume so; for it seems that some of them, if not all, had in their possession papers or certificates of German protection. These papers were shown to Jairam, the Customs Superintendent at Sur, and were taken hack (by the owners).4 It is a pity that they were not then withheld as there was no war then and all were at peace, but there being then no occasion for any suspicion, they were allowed to go. Another rumour that I have heard since my arrival here is that two persons from the interior arrived secretly here, at Sur, and embarked for some place up the Gulf, intending to join the Turks and then bring back with them German officers in order to take them into the interior of Oman. God only knows the truth of all this. I submit the news as it was received by me and you may take it for what it is worth. I am always ready to carry out your orders whenever you may be pleased to send any. Herevvitn the names referred to above :— 1. Rashid bin Ali bin Saroor. 2. Masood bin Rashid. 3. Khamis bin Rashid. 4. Ha mood bin Said. 5. Hashil bin Rashid. b. Salim bin Kkalfan. 7. Ali bin Hameed. These seven men belong to Sharqiya inhabiting Alayat Bira. They arrived from Zanzibar in a dhow belonging to a person at Batinah. They were landed at Tawi whence they proceeded to Oman on 22nd Jamadi II, 1332, just a little over a year now. Another man— No. 8. Khamis bin 'Mahomed el Khamisi is a clever scoundrel and a German subject and arrived iu the dhow belonging to Khamis bin Rashid, named “ Wadal Ayar ”, on the 28th Jamadi II, 1332, just a year and a few days ago. Enclosure ** C*\ Summary of information given by Haji Abdulla, Bastaki, of Wadi Ma’awal, to the Political Agent, Maskafc, on 25th May 1915. I am a resident of Wadi Maawal where I do business. I have just come from there. The fact of the British Consul having written letters to the Imam, Shaikh Isa and Shaikh Hamyar suggesting overtures for peace is generally known throughout the interior. The contents of the letter were publicly made known. The Consul’s letter is generally regarded as evidence of weakness on the part of the British Government. It is generally stated that the British have already had to reduce the number of their troops iu Maskat owing to the war and that as they now wish to remove rest of the troops also and cannot find more reinforcements, they are desirous of coming to terms. The religious leaders are preaching a jehad. They say that the “ Imams’’ of Maskat are nou powerful and that the present opportunity is a favourable one for attacking Maskat and driving out the Syud (Saltan) and the infidels. They recommended immediate action, but other people advised postponing the attack until after the date harvest and Ramazan, and this was decided upon. Their present attitude points to a determination to renew hostilities in the autumn. German agents have been at work in the interior. A sum of §4,000 was offered to the Imam, through Isa bin Saleh, last year by one Habib bin Sulayim of Muthahadamat, a German agent, who is known to have spent many years in the Congo. A message was sent with the money to the Imam to the following effect:—“ The money now sent you is only an advance. More will be sent you as much as is required to enable you to stir up trouble in Maskat against the English. We will help you, but* you should first send us a signed paper assuring us that you will do as we wish. You shall have justice and peace when we are established in Maskat.”No written reply or signed paper was given but a verbal message was sent in reply through IJabib bin Sulayim to the effect that “ nothing can be given in writing but if Maskat comes into our hands it will be well The ^1,000 was not accepted by the Imam. The above is what I have learnt regarding the feelings of the Oman Arabs. Ilecorded by me, R. A. E. BeNN, Lieutenant-Colonely Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat* Enclosure “ JD ”. Statement of Nasir bin Sulaiman, Siyabi, Wadi Samail, aged 60 years. T live in Wadi Samail and have come from there to give information to His Highness the Sultan of the state of affairs in my part of the country. It is generally known throughout the interior that the British Govern ment wrote a letter to the Imam and Shaikh Hamyar asking the people of Oman to make peace with the Sultan. All these letters were sent to Shaikh Isa for perusal as he is thought to be better able to understand these things. The Imam and Hamyar said they would accept whatever Shaikh Isa advised. The Imam, however, will never surrender and the people will never openly admit that they want peace. But they all see the hopelessness of their cause and of their trying to fight against the British troops and in their hearts they really welcome the offer of negotiations, lor this reason they have left the decision to Shaikh Isa as he is not an Imam and never can be. Shaikh Hamam, it is said, has been selected to succeed the A1 Kharusi as Imam, should the latter be killed. Since the late Imam died the tribes have become disunited and there is therefore hope of negotiations being generally accepted. The Imam is not preaching a general jehad, but he will fight to the end to overthrow the present state of affairs in Maskat where there is no Muhammadan law or justice of any kind, only favouritism. What offends the religious leaders more than anything else is the drinking of spirits and smoking w hich is permitted in Maskat. As regards the war, it is generally believed that the Germans have been victorious and that the German Emperor has become a Muhammadan and has assumed the name of Haji Mahomed Guillanme. We have also been told that all the Allies are begging Germany to put an end to the war, but the German Emperor has refused to do so. Germany is said to be stronger than all the allied Powers owing to her superior arms and new inven* tions for killing her enemies. Much news of the above kind reaches the interior and it presumably comes by letter, for whenever news is published it is stated that the information has been received “ by letter ” but neither the name of the sender nor the recipient is ever mentioned. Now-a-days news comes overland from Jeddah, the sea is thought to be unsafe for letters. Recorded by me. Maskat; I R. A. E. Benn, Lieutenant-Colonel, 8th June 1915. ) Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. Enclosure “ E'. Memorandum regarding a visit paid by Hamaid bin Saiyid el Faleti, resident of Wasit, TVadi Maawal, to the Political Agent, Maskat, on 29th May 1915. 1. On the 29th May 1915 one Hamaid bin Saiyid el Ealeti asked for and was granted an interview with the Political Agent. The object of his visit was ostensibly to express his friendship to the British Government; but, as his subsequent conversation proved it was more probably to obtain, on behalf of the rebel leaders, some further information regarding our recent offer of intervention and to ascertain to what extent certain demands of tne icbels of6 the details of which he appeared to be in possession were likely to he granted. While denying that he was in any way authorized to speak on hehalt ot the Imam or his party, he emphasised the fact that he had great inhuence with them through friends, and was prepared to convey to them any proposals that might he entrusted to him. 2. He appeared to he a man of some standing in the interior and has trade interests in Socotra. He stated he was known to the Aden authoiities and said that on one occasion he had successfully been employed by them as an intermediary in a long standing dispute with regard to Socotra. Incidentally he had a fairly accurate knowledge of the present European situation except with regard to the reasons for Turkey’s participation in the war on the side of Germany, on which point opportunity was taken to correct his knowledge. He also believed that the German Emperor had become a convert to Islam. 3. After some conversation on general topics, he introduced the subject Qf jyjy recent circular letter to the rebel leaders and stated that it had bten publicly read out and discussed in the interior. The people generally, he said, welcomed our intervention, but being unintelligent, they suspected that some ulterior motive lay behind our offer and were wondering “ what the British Government wished to gain out of it”. He was aware, he said, that replies had been received from the Imam and Shaikh Hamyar and enquired whether a third reply had not quite recently been received from Isa bin Saleh through the Imam. On being informed that such a reply had been received but that it was neither signed nor sealed, nor in the hand writing of Shaikh Isa, he stated that he could vouch for its authenticity and that it had been written by Isa’s brother-in-law'. He stated that he was present when it was received by the Imam and forwarded on to me. The contents had been shown to him by the Imam and in proof thereof he proceeded to quote quite accurately the purport of the letter. He said that Shaikh Isa hoped to receive a reply to his enquiry as to “ what terms we were prepared to offer ”. 4. Further conversation elicited the following information from him “The views, grievances, expectations and demands of the rebels are the following:— x “ (1) The Sultan is not really anxious for a reconciliation. He says he wants peace only to please the British Government. There is too much dirty linen to be washed, and this the Sultan wishes to avoid doing in public. The course of the negotiations will disclose matters of which we are not now aware. “ (2) The Sultan is generally regarded as a heretic. He does not conform to the Muhammadan Faith and has greatly incensed the people of Oman 'thereby. “ (3) The rebels would naturally prefer to have peace, hut would only agree to it provided the following demands were accepted :— “ (c«) The full recognition of the ‘ Sharah ’ Law as practised by the Imam in the interior and its establishment in Maskat in substitu tion of the existing unjust system of dealing with civil and criminal cases, bio favouritism to people connected with the Palace as now exists. “ (6) The removal of the British troops and the land blockade on imports in to the interior. “ (c) The full settlement of financial claims due to inhabitants in the interior. “ (d) The absolute prohibition of the import of wines, spirits and tobacco into Maskat and Oman. The use of these commodities to be strictly forbidden. “ (e) The present Sultan to be regarded a the!* Euler of Oman ’; but the Imam to administer the country according to the religious Law, as recognised in the interior, either personally or through a representative at Maskat. “(/) As the tribes of the interior live in a state of conflict with each other and as some tribes have rifles and others have not, it is/*\ 7 essential that the free purchase of arms and ammunition should he permitted to the inhabitants of Oman. ” He then asked if a reply could he given to him on these points and what my views were. 5. It was explained to him that the rebel leaders had already been invited to submit their grievances, that the Imam had promised to consult his followers on the subject and to communicate with me further. The Imam’s reply was still awaited and pending its receipt it would he premature to discuss details with him, especially as he appeared to be in no way authorised to speak on behalf of the Imam and his party. 6. The opportunity, however, was taken to inform him in general terms -what demands and conditions it would probably be unwise for the rebel leaders to include in any proposals that they might wish to submit in due course. These were — (1) Any demand that suggested the non-recognition of the Sultan’s legitimate rights in Maskat and the interior of Oman. (2) Any demand that suggested the contravention of Treaty rights between the British Government and Oman, in which connection we recognised no one but His Highness the Sultan, Syud Taimur. (3) Any demand that would cause injury to or hamper British interests or trade with Oman. (4) Any demand for the discontinuance of the existing Arms 'Ware house arrangements or the non-observance of its Buies and Begulations which would continue to be rigorously enforced. It was also explained to him that the British Government were now, as always, anxious for peace, and w r ould use their best endeavours to bring about a reconciliation between His High ness the Sultan and the rebel leaders, and that beyond that they had no other motive whatever. 7. After requesting me to obtain permission from the Sultan for him to return to his country, Hamad bin Sayad took his leave. 8. The following day the Sultan was informed of the purport of the above interview. His Highness approved of the action taken and of the reply given to Hamad bin Sayad. 9. Hamad bin Sayad left for Awahi, where the Imam is now residing ^on the 4th June. He promised to return after consulting “the people of Oman”. ' Maskat ; 6th June 1915. E. A. E.

E. Benn, C.I.E., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat, To—The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Basrah. In continuation of my confidential letter No. 129, dated the 14th June 1915, I have the honour to submit the following report on Maskat affairs more especially in connection with the correspondence recently initiated with the Imam and other rebel leaders on the subject of negotiations for a settlement of their differences with the Sultan of Maskat. 2. In paragraph 6 of my above quoted letter it was reported that I had received a visit from one Shaikh Ha maid bin Sa’id al Ealaiti of Awabi in the interior, who, while denying that he was in any way authorised to speak on behalf of the Imam and his party, appeared to have been expressly sent by them to make known their views regarding terms of peace and to ascertain how far these were likely to be accepted by us. These views were summarized and will be found in paragraph 4 of the Memorandum (Enclosure E) attached to my last report. Shaikh Hamaid appeared extremely anxious for me to commit my reply to paper forthwith and to entrust him with it as our emissary to the Imam, but, lacking as he did, any credentials from the Imam I deemed it inadvisable to comply with his request and confined myself to explaining to him that as correspondence had already been initiated between myself and the Imam on this subject and as the latter had promised to favour me with his own views and those of the other leaders personally, it would be both premature and in appropriate to discuss details with him meanwhile. Shaikh Hamaid left Maskat on the 4th June and promised to return. He has not yet done so. 3 3. On the 26th June, however, I received a letter from him and also one purporting to be from “ the Qazi of the Imam”. The latter letter is both unsigned and sealed, and though the views expressed therein may possibly represent those of the Imam, there is nothing whatever to show that this is so, and I venture to think that, in the absence of any endorsement thereon by the Imam, we should not be justified in acting on them. Shaikh Hamaid does not appear to have been very successful in his interview with the Imam ; for his letter admits that when he attempted to discuss matters with him the Imam “ turned his face away ” from him. In these circumstances, I have refrained from doing more than sending to the Shaikh an acknowledgment of his letter and that of the Qazi pointing out my inability to treat with him and repeating what I had already told him verbally in Maskat that I still awaited the pro mised reply from the Imam himself. In reply to this I received a somewhat118 indignant communication from the Sliaikh. A suitable reply has been sent to him and it is not proposed to continue further correspondence with him. I have also addressed a brief note to the Imam reminding him of his pro mise to submit his views and informing him that certain letters purporting to represent his views had been received by me from Shaikh Hamaid bin Said and others, but that in the absence of any endorsement on them by himself, it was impossible for me to accept or place any confidence in them. 4. I now attach copies of three of the abovementioned letters * Enclo sures I and III embody the “ terms ” upon Enclosures i, n, in. •which, according to Shaikh Hamaid and the Qazi of the Imam, the Imam and the rebel leaders are said to be prepared to proceed with further negotiations. Until we have it from the Imam himself that he endorses the views expressed it will serve no useful purpose to discuss those terms here. AVe should, I venture to think) continue to await the lepiy promised by the Imam himself. Meanwhile the letters now received are interesting as showing the very bio'ojited and anti-Christian spirit with which the followers of the Imam appear to be imbued, and as indicating what we may expect to receive from the Imam himself if and when he fulfils his promise to submit his views. 5. Since my last report was submitted a month ago, activity on the part of the rebels has been confined solely to the Bani Battash tribe who have given a good deal of trouble in the Wadi Hatat district where they were reported to have done considerable damage to date gardens owned by adherents of His Highness the Sultan. Khan Sahib Nasib bin Mahomed, the Naval Contractor, who owns valuable property at Hajjar in the Hatat, received a letter from the Bani Battash threatening him with the destruction of his gardens there unless he forwarded a considerable sum of money as the price of exemption. The amount, eventually reduced by frds, was paid by the Contractor. On the 37th June, a gang of Bani Battash visited the neighbourhood of Sidab and sniped at the detachment. The tribes more immediately connected with the Imam gave no trouble during the month. 6. His Highness the Sultan is now on the point of undertaking punitive operations, on what would appear to be on extensive scale against the Bani Battash. His Highness’s intention is to send four columns into the interior from different points on the coast as under — (1) Irom Mathra .—The Bani Buhaha tribe under the Wall of Mathra. (2) From Iti .—The Siyabiyin and Bani Jabir under Shaikh Bashid. (3) From Qaryat .—The Bani Aamir and Bani Ali under one of His Hiffhness’s brothers. *' 0 # (4) From Faghmar .—The Bani Bu Ali under the Wall of Sur. All the columns are to concentrate by different routes on flail Ghaf, the strongholi of the Bani Battash, rounding up any of their marauding gangs on the way. His Highness htis himself left Maskat in his steam yacht to supervise the above arrangements personally. Befoie his departure His Highness explained to me that he was not nnmindiul of the lact that peace proposals had been initiated with the Imam and that while thtse were still pending punitive operations such as he contemplated might be considered out of place; His Highness said that he quite recognised that it would be inappropriate for him to take the offensive in the case of those rebel tribes of the interior who always looked directly to the Imam for their orders; hut that as the Bani Battash, against whom alone these operations would he directed, were practically independent of tlie Imam and were mere bands of marauders whose depre-i dations were not instigated by the Imam, oflensive operations against them were justifiable and could not, he thought, in any way be regarded as a breach of faith on his part, 7.

After compliments .—I went to the men whom I expected to help me. I let them know what was my object and they agreed with me. I then went to the Imam and briefly explained matters to him ; but the Imam turned his face from me, as the subject seemed (to him) against the principles of our Muhammadan law. A certain man, who is one of the strong supporters of the Imam and who was one of those who had appointed the Kharusi as Imam, told me that there was hope of a settlement being arrived at, as the conditions (as explained by me to the Imam' did not seem to he very much in opposition to “ Shara ” and the laws of Islam and that the Imam would consult the Mullas and the tribal heads. If you wish for peace slave dealing should be allowed or in short if a slave escapes from his master (and takes refuge with you) he should be returned to his master. Arms, ammunition, gun-powder, lead, saltpeter, caps and such like may he allowed to be sold in Maskat and at their former prices. The excess duty now levied (by the Sultan) should be stopped. That is to say all trade allowed by “ Shara” should be permitted. Whatever “ Shara ” allows and disallows must be observed. Oman affairs should always he conducted according to the opinion of the “ Ulema ” of Oman. The Ulema will administer justice to all (Muham madans) as long as they are resident in Oman. Other particulars will be explained to you on my arrival at Maskat. Your authority (lit. protection) will not be recognised when “ Shara ” does not accept it, as all Muhammadans are under the religious law and they are bound to abide by the “ Shara ” and not by any other law. If you will reply assuring me that you agree to the above I will go to the leaders of Oman and collect their views and those of the Imam; but some of the conditions will, no doubt, have to be changed to suit “ Shara Signature of Hamaid bin Sa’id al Ealaiti.

I wish to try again as your representative. 1 intended to come to you this time but I became ill owing to heat when I left for Aw^abi. Please send me money for expenses with the bearer of this letter, Suleiman bin Mahomed. 'Written and signed by Hamaid bin Sa’id bin Shinen al Ealaiti with his own hand. Enclosure No. III. Translation of a letter (unsigned and unsealed) from Abdulla bin Rashid al Hashim, Qazi of Imam, to the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, dated the 5th Shaban 1333 (19th June 1915). After compliments .—Shaikh Hamaid bin Sa’id al Palaiti brought a message (to us) from you to the effect that you desire to negotiate for peace and120 prevent bloodshed and do good for all men, &amp;c., and in reply I inform you that a Mussalman will never agree to be led astray from the path of the Prophet-. “ Only the foolish man will suffer himself to be led away from the true path of Ibraham’s religion. ” If the message which Hamaid has brought is correct, then it behoves us to ask you for certain conditions both of a religious and of a worldly nature. You Christians are well aware that the Muhammadan religion allows certain things and forbids others— X. —You Christians have stopped us from dealing in slaves. This is injurious to all Muhammadans. Owing to lack of harmony among Muham madans you have gained strength. Were this not so, the benefits derived from our slaves would not have been lost. II.—You have taken possession of the sea and pretend that the sea belongs to you. You disputed the right of a former Imam, Azzan bin Qais, to the sear The sea is common to all. HI.—You interfere in the affairs of the Sultans of Oman and support them in matters which are unlawful and contrary to their own religion and they have acted against their religion. IV—The grievances from which the Oman people are suffering are— (1) the dollar which is really worth Its. 2-2-0 but has been reduced in value. The Oman people have no other coin except the dollar. (2) The price of food stuffs and cloth has been increased. Pood is necessary to live and cloth is necessary to clothe the body which God bids us to cover. Y. You have also stopped the trade in arms and ammunition. Arms are very necessary to maintain peace. And you allow wine to be drunk and tobacco to be used, while both these are contrary to our “ Shara ” (Muham madan faith). Whenever a slave comes to you you free him, although he belongs to his master. You allow things which are forbidden (by God) and disallow things which are allowed (by God). Do you expect me to agree to things contrary to my religion, that is to say, allow forbidden things and go against what God has imposed on mo ? JSo. Never. I cannot agree to this. Between us then, it comes to this— You must give up doing injustice. You must allow lawful things and put a stop to unlawful things. Remember how God has treated nations before us, and treat men with justice. Good treatment and just dealing and respect of religious principles will, God willing, bring both sides to an agreement. If you agree to the aforesaid conditions, which our religion demands, then only can we corqe to terms and I shall do my best to bring about peace, to obey God and bring benefit to Muhammadans and all others. God has ordained to His worshippers that whenever they are able to do so in this world they should recite their prayers, pay te zakat allow lawful things and forcibly stop unlawful things. We have now explained to you what we have to say and we have done so in order that you may not say that you asked for peace and it was refused or that you called upon us to do a good deed and we declined. But if you are working only for your own interests and, as you have hitherto done, intend forcibly to make peace, then we shall ask God’s help. Your treatment of the Muhammadans has been intolerable, but that is past and we are prepared to let bygones be bygones. Undoubtedly God is able to destroy our enemies if we adhere to our religion. God will help us if our intentions and deeds are good, men profit by experience and by refraining from committing sins. (Here follow quotations from “ Qoran ”) ******** We have written this letter only to clear ourselves from the censure so that you may not blame us for not replying to what you have proposed to us.121 If you agree to our abovementioned conditions, peace, otherwise we shall seek the assistance of God. we can agree to make P. S .—My son has also written to me from Burah praying me to try and arrange for peace. I send his letter to you. Please return it to me. I will also advise others to seek peace. If we agree with one another’s views, I shall see all the tribes and all the IJlemas (priests) and get them together with the Imam. (No signature or seal.) Translation of a letter to (his father) Abdulla bin Rashid al Hashmi (Kazi of Imam), dated at Burah, I5th Jamadi al Awal 1333, about 25th April 1915. After compliments .—I beg of our leaders who are wise and who are capable of being of one mind and of one opinion, with the help of one another according to the Muhammadan law and religion, to stop the bloodshed of Muhammadans without delay. You are able to negotiate for peace and God •will unite all hearts together. I cannot offer advice to the heads of the people, but you have influence with them and with the Imam. They will listen to you and accept what you propose. I hope that all of you will try to induce Shaikh Isa bin Saleh to propose terms of peace and not harm the people on the Coast of Oman. You know that the Coast of Oman is under the pro tection of the British. Can Oman people fight with the British ? The guns fire shells like rain. Can we hope for success in such circums tances ? Perhaps these words will arouse you and induce you to think about saving yourselves and others. This is my humble advice to my religious brethren and to my people. F. &amp; P. Dept.

H.H, again said he thought the visit would be fruitless as the Imam and his ^arty rfirtxiw were not serious in thid matter and did not really intend rhat the negotiations should come to anything* He agreed however that the negotiations should be given a chance and every effort be tried to bring the rebels to terms by peaceful measures with a view to an amicable settlement. ^e added that when negotiations had admittedly failed then he would undertake punitive operations against the Imam. He thought that he would be in a position to do this in about 8 weeks time when circumstances would be favourable for such xxxnx^M&amp;tXtBJfX measures. H.H. said the rebels wavering in thetr allegiance to the Imam and though the latter ahd his subuxBit* few personal adherents would never surrender or come to terras,the time was bound to come when the tribesmen would shake iwx off their allegiance and desert the Imam for H.H, # s cause.

From what I gathered at Sib I fear it is unlikely that re presentative will/ agree to come on board. Hamed Faleti told me representative would not be allowed to come even to beach f but only as far as outskirts of town on the band side,and he suggested - probbaly under instructions - a place saifi to be about 2 ipiles in land from a point on the Sib beach 2 miles west of bazaar in the V/ Wadi Arish,where people are all friendly to the Imam f and which I understand would be visible from Man-of-war. Hamed is in my opinion a mischief-maker and corrupt,and I suspect he is manufacturing difficulties for his own ends. The Imam must realize that we could only guarantee safety fer his repre semtative in a place selected by us. The above diffieulty may arise on 15th Sept, when I go to Std Sib.

The Government of India’s approval to this arrangement was received on 3rd.B^ptember in their Telegram,;©.899 S to your address, and I was authorized to proceed to fib if a man- of-war could be made available.

In the latter connection Ris Highness sets great hopes on the growing unpopularity of the Imam among the tribesmen ( as dis tinct from the religious leaders),who are beginning to realize that their religious head is the cause of all their present troubles (enhanced taxation ets.),nj;d he believes that very shortly, if he were to inarch into their country, the more imp- -ortont tribes would join his standard. As regards the reference to the Imam's death His Highness has more than once hinted that this unpopularity of the Imem is not unlikely to culminate before very long in his 'removal* in a manner which would only be in keeping with Omani methods.4 &amp; £« methods, 15th,3ept«aber X returned to 31b in IUJ •3, Dnlhou- Bie and &gt; ound iiheikh isa bin Balsh waiting to come and see me.

It will be convenient to consid- -er~the~latter~Statement first# A perusal of it will at once show that from the outset we are confronted with a dead lock which threatens to jeopardize the success of the negotia tions; nor at present does there seem much hope of an amicable adjustment of it# The main question in dispute is the surr- -ender to Hla Highness of the Bamail valley and Forts now helt by the I&gt; 3 am# Ly representation,behalf of the ' i uitan,of His Highness* lejdb&amp;xtxt* legitimate demand for the return of these and of the acknowledgement by the Imam of His Highness’ supreme authority in the interior which the Imam has usurped,was met by Sheikh Isa and his aasdeiatea by a curt and bombastic reply in the negative# hi a was mainly due to the influence of the .^azi Abdulla and Isa’s brother,both of whom hnd maintained a most sullen and contentious demeanour throughout the proceedings# After I had persuaded Sheikh Isa to dispense with their pre sence X found him far more inclined to be reasonable J but even then,all I was able to obtain from him was a promise that he would use his personal influence with the Inan to persuade t e latter to give up the Forts,though he held out little hope of success in the face of the superior influence possessed by the religious leaders v/ho guide the Imam# Evidently the counsels of the latter have prevailed; for since ?'! ’ 'W ri1 1 6» since * my return to i-aacat I have received a formal letter from the * Appendix &amp;• ^ Imaua himself confirming the verbal refua- -sal to surrender the Forts gisten to me by his representative at Sib* 7* During the absence from the interview of his associ- -ates,Sheikh Isa earpressed certain views and made certain admissions which,if we may regard them as sincere, are inter- -eeting* He stated that he fully realize/d that a continu ance of the present state of inxrent and enmity must mean a continuance -probably in an intensified form -of the incon -veniences which the oeople in the interior are now suffering -i from enhanced tax«ation,embargo on their foodstuffs r*nd the presence of British trropa on the main trade route from their country to the coast at Muscat and ‘'‘atrah* He admitted that the 3amail ^orts legitimately belonged to ° the Jiuling ouse of uman* and that the Imam liad undoubtedly usurped the 'ult- ' v ‘ an*a rights; but, he explained, the .utawwas ( religious heads) of the interior had clearly laid down that when once the possession of the 3^orts had been wrested from the Ruler in the name of the • Imam-il-husulmin *, their religious Chief nothing could possibly permit their surrender,during the life time og the present Imam, to any one and least of all to the present hultan who was regarded as irretrievably lost from the fold of true I ahoraadanissu If,he added, the -ultan could,by his future oondact,orove to the satisfaction of the Imam that it vas his desire to return to the right path,then the Imam would probably be the first to make peace and surr ender the Forts to His Highness* He begged me to convey his respects to the Bui tan ?'nd to remind him of their old friendship in the days of ''ayad ais- *1,the late hiltan; and he concluded by saying that there was only one possible way out of the present situation and that was not to raise the question of the Forts 0 as long as the present Imam is alive ', by which it was not difficult to see that he meant to imply 0 pending the Imam’s death '•death’ * fter Uiat event,Vie aaid, there would he no difficulty about the surrender of the forts. The impression he wished to convey seemed to ne to be that the Imam's days were numbered,and I would not venture to pm place this information on record were it no' for the fact that it coincides with similar hints which His Highness has Itxmx occaa- -ionally let fall in private conversation with me and with the iniormation which 1 have gained during conversations with cer~ tain Arab gentlemen of standing in ^ascat. Fhe wish in this case may,of course,be only father to t ^e thought and it would be rash to depend on such a for nebulous contingency jcw a solution of the present difficulties, lixninating it, thereto re, from our escalations there would seem three to be but one of j&amp;tft courses left openi- (i) .Either Hi a Highness must agree to set his houH© in order in accordance with the Imam's religious views and by the intru- •duction of such reforms as may be deemed reasonable endeavour to jgr&amp;xa give some proof of his desire to conform to the doct rines of the ^oran as interpreted by the Imam, in return for wkxc whioh the latter would acknowledge his Highness* supremacy and surrender the Forts,or (ii) Ilia Highness must, when negotiations are abandoned, carry out his determination to reduce the Imam to submission ■ nd obt« ftin possession of the Forts by force of arms, or (iii) Allowances,sufidtieiantly large to bo attractive and guar anteed by the British Government#must oe offered to the Imran, Sheikhs Isa and Haayar to induce them to surrender the Forts to us for disposal as we wish. ( which is ext re mtly u nlikely ) a regards (i),even if the °ultan were willing/'to 'agree to r proposition which implies the superior right of the Imwa to dictate terms to him#the complete acquiescence of Hid Highness in the peculiar doctrines of the Imam which would no doubt be demanded of him and which it would certainly be very difficult if not impossible for His Highness to agree to,renders the chances of success in this direction very remote.reaote been Ae regards has already/explained that v is highness consjiders that an opportune moment for taking the offensive against the rebels will shortly present itself« The Sultan is very anxious to take this step. He is convinced that the no Xmsun now/longer enjoys the support of certain tribes in the interior and that a ieries of disappointments and miscalcul- -ations,culminating in the complete oefeat of the rebels by the British garrison in January last* have tended to break up his follow n . : is Highness understands thatj/ in this venture he cannot active hope for any/military assistance from us raid h^ is prepared to alone , tske the rink 'with the local material at his command} but I would in this connection take the opportunity of bringing to your notice a request that His Highness has more than once begged ne to submit to you, namely*that Government will be pleased to give him on payment or loan or present to him out right two of the urkis ; guns captured from the enemy during the operations in Mesopotamia. hese would very materially assist him in attaining his object in the Hinterland. The moral effect of their presence with His Hi ihness^ would be very great and would undoubtedly ***»Mrfc attract very many w&amp;verers to his eif3e* while the fact that the * uns were urke- -ish weapons captured by us would no doubt bring home to the rebels in a tangibile form the succors of the British arms in t. the Mesopotamian campaign. As regards (iii)*His Highness is much averse from paying any allowance to the Imam, tout he would,I think, be prepared to agree to allowances being paid to 'heikhs lea and Hamyar up to a reasonable amount from the subsidy, if the &gt;'ort» were return- -ed to him. It is significant that at the interview much stress was laid by Bheikh Isa on this question of allowances from which v/e may perhaps infer that the proposal in an attractive one, and it is possible that in this direction may lie the means of arrivesarriy- -ing at a solution of the present difficulty* The aoount mentioned in the statement of rebel demands is a large one,namely 1 lac of rupeee - the sum prid by/ ub as ann~ uni gubeidy to Hie Hi ijmess in connection with the stoppage of the Arms ‘raffle. If and when the negotiations at I3ib are hesumod,! would suggesl that t)ie Political Af?ent be authorized to proceed on the linee of this third alternative. It would seem to be the line of leant reelstance. 10.

When my last report was despatched, the reply from the Imam to our invitation to state his grievances with a view to their amicable adjust ment, through us, with His Highness the Sultan, was still awaited. No reply, in spite of a reminder which was sent to him, has yet been received from the Imam; but a joint letter from Sheikh Hamed bin Said and Abdulla bin Rashid, the Qazi of the Imam, both of whom have been referred to in previous reports, has been received. A translation of this latter—some what lengthy—communication, with its enclosures, is attached herewith for information. The letter purports to have been written by the command and with the approval of the Imam, though the latter has not in any way endorsed it with his signature or seal. The writers, however, enclose, with the letter, a letter, in original signed by the Imam and addressed to one of them, Abdulla bin Rashid, appointing the latter individual to his “former position of trust” as “ Qazi of the Imam ” and Administrator of Muhammadan Law, by which it is intended no doubt to convey the idea that the Qazi is the accepted representative of the Imam and authorized to conduct correspondence on his behalf.. The translation of the letter has been extremely difficult and the sentences are all so involved that it has not been easy to arrive at a very clear under standing of the real intentions of the writers. On the one hand it is stated that, as an essential preliminary to any further discussion of terms, our acceptance of the conditions already laid down * Enclosure in to my letter No. 145, dated 14 th in the Qazi s former letter* and reiterated July iyi5. in his present communication is neces^ sarv. My reply accepting these conditions is, it is said, awaited, and on its receipt the matter will be referred to the Imam and the other Chiefs when an invitation will bo sent to me to meet the rebel representatives at a certain place to discuss further details. If an Agreement is then arrived at the Imam,, we are informed, will be pleased to affix his seal and signature to the document. On the other hand I am asked to await a further communication which, it is said, the Imam himself will send me as soon as the views of Sheikhs Isa bin Saleh and Hamyar bin Nasir, to whom my previous letters are said to have been submitted for opinion, have been received. 3. In replying to the above letter I have merely acknowledged it and intimated that I am awaiting the promised letter from the Imam.4. The remaining portions of the letter merely repeat the demands made in previous letters. We are asked to explain r 'f interfere m the disposal of Omani slaves, the arms traffic and His Highness s affairs generally; while the presence of our troops is objected to an stress laid on the necessity for the introduction and establishment of the “ Shara ” Law in Maskat to the exclusion of all other Codes and the accept- ance by the Sultan of a Deputy of the Imam to reside at llis fli B Capital. , 5. His Highness is of opinion that we shall never obtain a direct statement from the Imam himself of his views and grievances ^ Sheikh Isa bin Saleh has succeeded m inducing the Imam and the other Chiefs to believe that our peace proposals are merely a cloak to cover cer am sinister designs that we harbour on Oman, and that Sheikh Isa will put every obstacle in the way of peace negotiations. The Imam has certainly given ns no serious indications so far of Ins desire to have direct dealings with us ; and as it would seem undesirable i us to treat with the present or any other ^ self-appointed .exponents of the Imam’s views, the question arises whether—if any advance in the direction of peace negotiations is to be made—it would not he advisable for the 1 oh teal 4event, Maskat, to proceed to Sib as soon as convenient in conjunction with His Highness and, if possible, visit the tribal headquarters with military escort, and there endeavour to bring about a settlement on the lines mdi* cated in your telegram No. 192 B., dated 5th February 191o. 6 Meanwhile events have been taking place in the interior which may tend to influence the attitude of the Imam and the rebel leaders. In my last report I mentioned that His Highness contemplated punitive operations against the Beni Battash tribe. These operations culminated successful y a^ the end of July in the unconditional surrender to the Sultan of the Beni Battash Sheikh and the entire tribe. His Highness occupied Baghmar, their village on the coast and Hail, the Beni Battash stronghold m the interior. At the latter place His Highness stayed a day and by way of impressing the people gave a practical demonstration of the working of the Maxim guns which he had taken with him. I understand that the Beni Battash Sheikh is now with His Highness on tour. Encouraged bv his recent success in the south-east, the Sultan has now proceeded to° Sih * (the port for the Yv r adi Samail valley) tvith a strong force of “ Askaris, *’ his Maxim gun detachment and contingents sent from Samail by the Beni Jabir and Siyabivin tribes whose Sheikhs have lately been profuse in their protestations of loyalty to His Highness ; hut of whose sincerity to his cause His Highness is very doubtful. It is, however, unlikely that His Highness will make any immediate advance ’into the interior against the Imam, who still holds the Samail forts, partly because he cannot trust the Beni Jabir and Siyabiyin, but mainly, he tells me, in view of the peace negotiations which have been initiated by us and which, as explained above, are still in progress. His Highness expressed the hope before he left on tour that the presence of his troops at Sib—fresh from their successful operations against the Beni Battash would have a pacifying effect on the Imam and assist these nego tiations. It is now reported that the Imam has blocked the road to Samail and is endeavouring—though with only partial success—to collect sufficient men to oppose the advance which, he thinks, the Sultan contemplates in earnest. It is stated that the rebels are only half-hearted in their support of the Imam, owing partly to his ignominious defeat on the occasion of his attack on Maskat in January last, and partly to the discontent which exists in the interior over the excessive “ Zikat ” taxes which the people are now called on to pay—in the interior to the Imam, and on the coast to the Sultan. It is said that several tribes have threatened the Imam that, unless the tax is removed, they will go over to the Sultan,3 The latent reports from Sib (not yet confirmed by His Highness) indicate that what His Highness anticipated has come to pass. The Beni Jabir and Sivabivin are reported to have deserted en mass from the Sultan’s camp and to have tied back to Samail. Such is the situation to date. His Highness is expected to return from Sib this week when further available. 8. A copy of this report is more definite information will be to the Hon’ble the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. Translation of a joint letter from Abdulla bin Rashid bin Saleh A1 Hasbmi, Q,azi of the Imam, and Shaikh Hamaid bin Sa'id al Falaiti to the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat, dated the 14th Ramazan 1333 (27th July 1915). After compliments .—I have received your letter in reply to mine of the fith Sha’aban and (am glad to hear) that you have understood it. You say that the letter was neither signed nor sealed by anybody and {you also remark) that if the contents represent the opinions of the Imam and the Chiefs, then the Imam should have signed the letter. In reply, I beg to say that I have already informed you in my firSt letter that if you are able to agree to the conditions proposed, then we (the undersigned) will hold a con ference with the Imam and the Chiefs and then invite you to join ns at a certain place and then we shall inform you of our conditions concerning Maskat and the villages and towns in the interior of Oman. 'When some Agreement has been reached, the Imam will put his seal and signature along with those of other notables and you also will affix your seal and signature if you are authorized by your Government to do so. Each party will then depart with a copy of the Agreement and be bound by the conditions laid down therein. When I received your letter of 16th July, which was a reply to mine, I •took it to the Imam and those who were with him and then we sent the letter to Sheikh Isa bin Saleh on the advice of the Imam and his friends. And we have also sent a copy of that letter to Sheikh Hamyar bin Nasir and to Amer bin Khamis and their friends. The reply will, God willing, be sent to you in due course. The reply will come to you from the Imam (and it will be written) in the presence of the abovementioned Sheikhs. You should be prepared to receive it; and (you will be able) to distinguish those conditions which are capable of acceptance by us and those which are not. And you should not consider our demands as extraordinary or be surprised at the terms we ask. For Oman and all other Kingdoms are controlled and guided by the principles (as laid down) by religious rules. Then, who (has the right) to stop us from taking back our escaped slaves in Maskat or elsewhere ? Who (has the right) to prevent us from prohibiting the things which are forbidden by God, such as, dealing in wine and tobacco? Who (has the right) to stop us from dealing in rifles, ammuni tion, gunpowder, saltpetre, lead, caps and all kinds of arms which a man must have in order to protect his family and his religion ? Who (has the right) to stop us from sending our rifles by sea ? You (British) stopped the Imam Azzan bin Qais from doing this, for you sank his guns. Who (has the right) to stop us passing orders prescribed by our religion and from directing th* performance of all (religious) duties, the prohibition of unlawful things and their distribution among the weak and the strong ? W T ho has the right to stop us bringing Faith into the light of day and setting (on the right path) the leaders who go astray ? God has said “ Those to whom We give power on earth must perform prayers and pay ‘ Zikat ’ and enforce the proper observance of (religious) duties and the abandonment of things forbidden by God.” Who has the right to stop us passing orders according to our “ Shara ” against the Sultan jf he acts contrary to Muhammadan Law and if he does not follow the latter A. On4 / strictly ? What right have you to oppose us whenever we come to punish him who is of our Eaith ? You fire on us with your rifles as you did in Masnaa in the days of Ibrahim bin Qais w T ho in his days was a learned man of renown and who followed the “ Shara ” according to his own views and those of the rest of the “ Ulema’h See also how you treated us at Barka when you fought with • Refers to bombardment of Barka by H.M.S. US.* By what right too have JOU stopped “Fox”in 1914 . 0 ur trade with Aden by making our vessels (from the Batinah coast ? ) call at Maskat en route aud pay duty to- the Maskat Customs when they (the vessels) have no business to transact at Maskat? Omani traders also, who go to Bombay and Karachi and other British ports, are made by you to (observe) the same conditions and in this* way our trade is hampered. You have had great experience of the Omani traders. You know they have no means of profit except from Oman. The people of Oman are not intelligentthey are mostly lazy and poor. I write to you. Oh Colonel, knowing you to he wise man and of good, understanding and the representative of the British Government. I ask. you “ Is it fair (lit. lawful) to call upon the Imam to agree to conditions which are of no interest or profit to him ” ? Or to ask him to accept only such terms as you want, while at the same time unlawful things are permitted to continue in Maskat? God has said “ Bo not depend on unjust men. If you do you will burn by the fire. ” The upshot of all this is that if you wish Oman (the dominions of Maskat) to remain under the rule of Syud Taimur then he must follow and obey “ The Muhammadan ” (probably the Imam is meant) and conduct all his affairs according to Muhammadan Law (which must be observed also) by his close relations and friends and by the public equally both high and low. He (the Sultan) must accept and permit the Deputy of the Imam to live with him in Maskat to see that the orders of Muhammadan Law are carried out. (The- Deputy) will give or withhold permission according to that Law and protect the rights of the subjects. (If Syud Taimur agrees to all this) then the Imam and his followers will be bound not to oppose him in any way either in his- Court or his buildings or any defence works belonging to him. The following conditions), therefore, may be agreed upon between us, viz. — Every slave should he given hack to his- master. The dealing in arms should he permitted and everything appertaining to arms should be allowed also, No rules except our (Muhammadan) rules should be permitted. But if you intend to- exercise your authority over both sides, viz., over the Imam’s people and Syud Tainmr’s as well, then (Isay) this will never be permitted by our religion; for we do not ask for worldly things; we ask only for the recognition of Muhammadan Law and of the right to “ bid and forbid ” according to the “Shara” of Islam. God is- Almighty and He is able to assist us and destroy our enemies. He has said “ I hold myself bound to help- the believers ” ; and we expect such help from Him. (Here follow quotations from the Qpran.) * • * * * * *- * “ He who will try to obtain all, will lose all. ” Me have no seals. The Imam (May God bless and keep him!) has no other terms but these. If you agree with us then all will be well. Me await your reply to appoint a day on which the leaders of Oman- will be summoned. I assure you that we and the Imam are of one mind (in this matter). We have shown the Imam this letter, and Imam’s letter (to us) is here-* with sent to you for perusal aud return, as was done in the case of the former letter which has already been sent back to us.5 Dated—after haying been seen by the tmam and at bis request that it should be sent to you.

The correspondence is mainly concerned with the rising of the Imam of Oman, Salim bin Rashid al-Kharusi, against the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Taimur bin Fayṣal bin Turki al-Bu Sa‘idi, in 1915. British officials offered to interfere between the Sultan and the Imam Government in order to reach a peaceful agreement between the two parties.The Political Agent, Muscat, and the Imam’s representatives were in continuous communication in order to reach a deal. Following his meeting with them at Seeb (also called Sib), the Political Agent sent a report to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Basra, in which he included the Imam’s demands and the Sultan’s remarks on them. Among the demands of the Imam and his followers were the following:to remove all the unjust and corrupt
