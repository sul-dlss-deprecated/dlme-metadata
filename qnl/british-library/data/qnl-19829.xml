The Shaikh of Dubai has since put in a claim to the Residency Agent for 125 camels which he alleges were looted in the fight between Abu Dhabi and Dubai tribesmen at Shimairikh. 3. I am now informed that this clash took place while the Abu Dhabi raiding party were encamped at Shimairikh on their way back from the Beni ^itab country, and thus any damage suffered by the Shaikh of Dubai would appear to be the direct result of his unwarranted interference in the affairs of Abu Dhabi and the Beni Qitab. - ^ ^ * 4. The incid^fit is one covered by paragraph four of my Telegram No/35 of the 29th January, and, therefore, if you have no objection, I propose to inform the Shaikh of Dubai that Government is not responsible for the recovery of his camels and that he should arrange for their recovery in the normal tribal manner. 5. Since thfe Shimairikh incident took place the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has agreed to make peace with the Beni Qitab and the Shaikh of Dubai has once more promised to cease interfering between them. Dubai has also expressed his desire to restore friendly relations with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi.

DUBAI - ABU DHABI DISPUTE. 167 (iii )o Reference paragraph 156 (iii) of Intelligence Summary No. 14. The Rulers of Umm al ^aiwain, Has al Khaimah and Sharjah, and Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin, Chief of the Beni Qitab, met at Falaj al ^li to arrange for the restoration of friendly relations between the Beni Qitab and the Ruler of ifbu Dhabi. The Regent _ of Kalba also attended the meeting but took no part in the discussions. It was decided that each of the^three_ Rulers should write to the Ruler of Abu Dhabi informing him of the desire of the Beni Qitab to restore friendly relations and offering to act as a mediator. No letter has so far been written however because each Ruler is waiting for one of the others to write first. The Ruler of Sha^jah has informed tr.e Residency Agent that he considers that no letter should issue until Shaikh I'uhammad bin Ali^Huwaidin confirms that he really desires the restoration of friendly relations with Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile further small tribal clashed have been reported. The first was a reprisal raid by the Beni Qitab on Qattarah village in Buraimi. They succeded only in slightly wounding one on the villagers through they subsequently reported to the Shaikh of Dubai that they had killed some four o^ five men. He was pleased and gave them lavish present?.^- The second clash took place at the well M A1 Murrah' between a small raiding party of the I anasir and Al Bu Shamis and some Beni Qitab tribesmen. The latter sustained two killed and lost some camelB but are believed to have killed one of the raiders.The third clash took place between about 200 men of the Awamir, Manasir, nhbab, Al Bu Shamis, and other Abu Dhabi tribesmen, on the way to raid the ;eni Qitab, and a detachment of 25 Dubai bedouin who opposed them at a place called Shimairikh nearNazwah. Nine of the Dubai bedouin were killed and five injured but they are reported to have killed five of the raiders, including i.Tahammad bin Nasir Bu Qbai, Chief o p the hanasir. This report however is still'unconfirmed.

The Shaikh of Dhank and Shaikh Obeid bin jum'ah. Chief of the Beni Ka'ab, have informed the Residency Agent that they wish to mediate for the restoration of friendly relations between Abu Dhabi and Dubai and have asked whether we have any objection. I am instructing Residency Agent to reply that we have no objection. I do not think however that they will meet with any success in view of evidence T have received that the Shaikh of Dubai is still interfering between the Beni Qitab and Abu Dhabi and that he has no real desire to come to a settlement with the latter. 3. On the 25th August Hamid bin Buti, maternal uncle of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, arrived at sharjah with a letter from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi empowering him to make peace with the Beni Qitab on behalf of Abu Dhabi, it had been previously arranged that shaikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin, Chief of the Beni Qitab who was living at Dhaid, should come to Sharjah to meet the Abu Dhabi representative. He did not put in an appearance however although he was twice reminded of this arrangement by the Residency Agent, but replied that he was not in a position to make peace with Abu Dhabi. He also confessed to the messenger that he had given a pledge to the shaikh of Dubai not to make a separate peace with Abu Dhabi and that this was the reason he could not come. I am informed that Shaikh Rashid, eldest son of the Shaikh of Dubai, recently had a secret meeting in the desert with Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin, when he extracted this pledge from him. He also gave him 11 rifles, 5,000 rounds of ammunition, 2,000 rupees in cash, and a number of provi sions. On the 3rd September Hamid bin Buti left Sharjah. 4. in view of the clashes that had been taking place between Dubai and Abu Dhabi tribesmen I telegraphed the Residency Agent on the 25th August to remind both Shaikhs of their promises to keep the peace and withdraw their forces. On receipt of the Residency Agent's letter the Shaikh of Dubai sent secret instructions to a body of his forces camped at Mudatha asking them to join the Beni Qitab in a raid they had been preparing against Buraimi. It has since been confirmed that the raiding party attacked Sijya and Riqi in Abu Dhabi territory, looted 100 camels, and killed one Manasiri and one Amiri tribesm«ri. 5. It will be seen that the Shaikh of Dubai deli berately broke his undertaking not to indulge in atiy aggress ive acts, and that he did not withdraw his forces when reminded to do so. He has also broken his promise to us to cease interfering between the Beni Qitab and Abu Dhabi. He has admitted to the Residency Agent that he gave arms, ammu nition, and provisions, to the Beni gitab, but states that this was before he gave us his promise to cease interfering. I have every reason to believe that this is a deliberate lie. ! CY /6. The p •k-VX*' 36. The Shaikh of Dubai has now heard that an Abu Dhabi raiding party may be moving against his territory and has informed the Residency Agent that he must take measures to defend himself. He has been informed however that I consider him responsible for the recent friction and any further raiding that may result as he has repeatedly broken his promises to maintain the status quo and to cease interfering in tribal affairs that are not his concern. He has also been warned that unless there is an immediate improvement in the situation measures will be taken against him. At the same time I have reminded the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi of his promises to maintain the status quo, and have expressed Government's concern at the recent increase in raiding and the importance we attach to his co-operation. 7. In view of the above I consider that punitive measures may have to be imposed on the Shaikh of Dubai very shortly should I find him responsible for any further derioration in situation. I am at present con sidering the nature of the punishment that may be required and will approach you for authority should it become necessary. Sd./- J.E.H.

To - political Resident, Bahrain. NO.C/1180. Dated the 20th of October, 1946. s Reference correspondence ending with my Express Letter No.c/1024 dated the 10th September, 1946. 2. The Residency Agent reports that on 8th October, 1946, he received information that a party of Manasir and yd Awamir tribesmen had recently raided a Beni Qitab encampment at Rafiah, 25 miles due east of Sharjah, killed three, and wounded two Beni Qitab tribesmen, and looted about 70 camels. Although no Abu Dhabi subjects were concerned in the raid, and Dubai subjects suffered no injuries from it, the raiders were pursued by a combined party of about 50 Beni Qitab and Dubai tribesmen. This party came up with the raiders near the south-eastern tip of Jabal Faiyah, and, in the clash which then ensued two Beni Qitab and three Dubai tribesmen were killed and two Dubai tribesmen wounded. The raiding party suffered five casualties, but retired still in possession of their loot. Some 12 camels in all were killed during the fighting. 3. The Residency Agent informs me that the shaikh of Dubai received news of the raiding party the day before the first incident occurred, and sent a messenger by car to warn the Beni Qitab to arrange for their camels to be taken fur ther north to a place of safety. The day after the raid he proposed to Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin, Chief of the Beni Qitab, that they should carry out a joint raid against the Buraimi villages in Abu Dhabi territory, but the latter replied that he had been too badly hit by the, raids Against him to be able to join in such a raid for at least another month. - / 4. The Shaikh of Dubai then apparently decided to carry out the raid unaided as on the 10th October the Resi dency Agent was informed that he was making preparations for doing this. The Residency Agent then sent him a letter, copy enclosed, which seems so far to have had the desired deterrent effect. SL&gt; — X- o ^ -j 5. The Shaikh of Dubai's attitude throughout the present incident has, however, been consistent with his repeated disregard of Government's warnings in the past to cease all interference in Beni Qitab and Abu Dhabi affairs, and I am convinced that it will not be long before he commits another breach of the peace. 6. He persists in allying himself closely with the Beni Qitab, and in exerting his influence to prevent them from making their peace with Abu Dhabi. He is keeping his camels with the Beni Qitab camels, and has recently made a present to Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin of another Rs.2,000 in cash and 2,000 rounds more of ammunition. 7. I consider, therefore, that the time has come for me to be in a position to bring further pressure to bear at short notice on the Shaikh of Dubai to refrain from disturbing the peace of the desert, and accordingly request permission to re-impose sanctions, including the stoppage of steamer calls at Dubai, as soon as this action appears necessary.

No.c/92 The 17th of January, 1947. 6- Will you please refer to the correspondence/^ ending with paragraph 9 of my Express Letter No .c /670 dated the 23rd of June, 1946, on the subject of the dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi over the Khor Ghana- dhah? I enclose two tabulated statements of the claims of both parties which I have compared and marked according to the value of each claim made. The result leaves no room for doubt that the Khor Ghanadhah is in Abu Dhabi territory. 2. The political Officer, Trucial Coast, the Residency Agent and myself are all agreed that it would be better not to announce a decision. Amongst the reasons for this are that both shaikhs know perfectly well in whose terri tory the Khor lies, and also because a decision on the ownership of the Khor does not advance the settlement of the boundary dispute since the probable boundary lies con siderably to the north of the Khor. Further, I think that until we know which area will become of importance due to the discovery of oil we need not enter into inter-state boundary disputes. We should do this only in connection with a pre-determined policy. 3. It is possible, however, that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi may raise the question when he will be entitled to a direct answer. If 'he does so I suggest that he may be told that we are in no doubt that the Khor lies within his territory. The Shaikh of Dubai could be told the same, though he is not likely to raise the question. 7 The Tlon f ble Lt-Col. W.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.

Nineteen years ago a boat belonging to a Bahrain! sank near jarf on the eastern bank of Khor Ghanadhah; the cargo was looted and a complaint made to Dubai, The Shaikh of Dubai paid Rs.5,000 compensation. 3. Fifteen years ago a diving boat owned by Abdullah bin Said bin Ghalib,a Dubai subject, was fired on at Khor Ghanadhah by Muhammad bin Nasir Bu Qbai al Mansuri and his men. Shaikh Bu Qbai apologised. 4. In 1937 after meeting the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, the Shaikh of Dubai claimed that the boundary agreed upon was Bandar Hisyan and a line drawn southwards, all territory to the west was Abu Dhabi. Dubai claims that shaikh of Abu Dhabi altered this in his letter (which he opened later,') to read Bandar Hisyan, Ghaffat er-Ramaq and to the east. Hearsay evidence is given by two Dubai subjects confirming this, but boat owner is long since dead, Dubai paid compensa tion probably because the robbers were Dubai people. No evidence. See last sentence above. This claim is pointless. The Shaikh of Dubai claimed no com pensation. Bandar Hisyan is difficult to place accurately, but it is certainly south-east of Khor Ghanadhah.

In typical Arab fashion Abu Dhabi has tried to get out of his res ponsibility for imposing peace upon his allies by sug gesting that Dubai should negotiate direct with them.

You must realise, 0* Shaikh, that you cannot accept the advantages of your position of authority and evade the res ponsibilities; and one of the most important responsibilities is that you control any tribes who enter your territory or con duct warlike operations therein. I, therefore, call upon you according to the terms of your agreement to impose peace upon all the tribes who were your allies in the recent hostilities with Dubai. This is a matter for you yourself alone and is not a concern of the Shaikh of Dubai's.

The Shaikh of Dubai did not at first himself take steps to secure the return of the camels, but reported the matter to the Residency Agent. Dubai does not feel that he can count on the co-operation of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi's brothers in -uraimi through which the culprits retired with [;he camels. The Shaikh of Dubai has also alleged that Shaikh Zayid, the brother of Shaikh Shakhbut, has been discouraging Dubai subjects from visiting Buraimi.

This will give us a chance to see just how much Abu Dhabi is prepared to help Dubai against his (Abu Dhabi's) former allies. Meanwhile, I have also instructed the Residency Agent to delay release of Shaikh Shakhbut 1 s quotas of cloth and sugar for the month of September, because it may become necessary to re-impose economic sanctions while we yet have the sugar and cloth to withhold from him. 7. My own view is that Shakhbut's trouble with his former allies has arisen because he has not adequately paid them for their part in the operations on his behalf, nor compensated them for their losses. Until he is made to realize - by the denial of his quotas - that such parsimony is bad economy, it is unlikely that he will pay them or be able to control them. 8.

The quarrel will then become one for settlement between Shakhbut and his allies, rather than between him and Dubai; and Shakhbut may realize that he must either control his allies or pay compensation for their thieving. 4.

Jackson, Esq., Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah, to the political Agent, Bahrain. Please refer to your demi-official letter N o.g /1168 dated the 7th December, 1947. 2. I will deal first with paragraph 3 of the Resident's demi-official letter No.2057-S, dated ohe 29th November, 1947., . You will recall, particularly from my express letter No .c /200. 0215 dated the 21st February, 1947, that the withholding of his sugar and cloth quotas was an important factor in bringing Shaikh Shakhbut to terms with Dubai last year. The imposition of these sanctions did not impose any new hardship on Shakhbut's people, because he had for some time been selling the quotas en bloc for export to Persia, and had been using che profits to help finance his operations against Dubai. 3. The value of these sanctions as a deterrent has since declined because, although the cloth quota is still a source of profit, the sugar quota is now unsaleable for export to Persia. Since there has been a recrudescence of raiding by the Manasir, it has become clear from a number of sources that they are being instigated and assisted by Shaikhs Hazza* and ziayid, brothers of Shaikh Shakhbut (paragraph 6 of my memorandum No. 1241.0215, refers). Tt was also clear from the outset that the grain quota was being used to feed the raiding parties. You will agree that it would have been incongruous for us on the one hand to call upon Shaikh JP Shakhbut to control his allies and to threaten him with the con sequence of his failure to do so (your letter No.c/586 dated the 15th May, 1947) and, on the other hand, to provide liim with the means of continuing his instigation of the Manasir. All Abu Dhabi's quotas were, therefore, withheld. 4. The intention was that this should again lead to Shakhbut's coming to terms with Dubai and, this time, to his controlling his allies - or rather to his refraining from instigating them against Dubai. There are now indications that, if we persist in this policy long enough, there is a good chance of its succeeding (paragraph 7 of my memorandtiim No.1241.0215), although the chances lessen as supplies of sugar and wheat become increasingly available from other sources. ^ rr 5. Having withheld these quotas since September we now have to decide what to do with them. If we surrender them entirely we shall be embarrassed when Abu Dhabi fails in with our wishes and asks for his quotas to be restored. Once surrendered they may .veil be diffi cult to secure again. If we retain them and eventually deliver Shakhbut the accumulated quotas of some months we should be very weak position if he were again to break his word. Our sanctions would then be ineffective until such time as he had used up his reserves, for you can be assured that, if released to the Shaikh, the accumulated quotas will not necessarily be distributed to his people. Further, if we sell them, we might bring home to Shaikh /Shakhbut\ -2- Shakhbuti thac camels stolen from Dubai will become a charge on himself, as proposed in your demi-official letter No.c/1137 of the 26th November. 6. If these economic sanctions do not prove effective, we shall have to think of others. I would not recommend our inter fering with the Oil Company's operations. As far as the Oil Company are concerned Shaikh Shakhbut's behaviour is sacisfactory. The security in his area is exemplary; and he does everything in his power to facilitate the Company's work. It is clear, too, Lhac, unlike Ras al Khainah and Sharjah, Shakhbut and his brothers have complete control of their area. 7. The Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company now wish to prospect in two of Shakhbut's Islands and I would not recommend our dissuading them if they are welcomed by the Shaikh. 8. There remain political sanctions. We could deny travel facilities to his subjects; but the effect on him or on his sub jects would be negligible. Eventually we come to the use of force. Uncil the war and our imposition of control over cloth and foodstuffs, this was almost the only sanction we had do use on the Trucial Coast. Before 1940 we did not hesitate to use it, even in the type of slavery case that today elicits from us no more than a remonstrance. Himriyah and Fujairah have been bombarded in the not distant past and Mr. Weightman tooii $ sloop to Abu Dhabi as recently as 1938 to execute the Resident's instructions in a case of alleged slavery. 1 understand that he was authorized to bombard the Shaikh's fort, if he thought it necessary, without further reference to the Resident. There should be papers in the Bahrain Agency office. 9. The eventual use of force is implicit in the exercise of our authority on the Trucial Coast; and we cannot presume to settle disputes between Shaikhs unless we are prepared, if necessary, to enforce our settlements. This must be faced unless we are entirely to wash our hands of their internal affairs, even when our own defence and commercial interests are at stake. We are unlikely uo be able to enforce a settlement of the Dubai-Abu Dhabi boundary dispute if the Shaikhs get the impression that we cannot enforce our settlement of hostilities arising out of it; and, if we cannot enforce the settle ment of boundary disputes on the Trucial Coast, Che development of its oil resources by companies sponsored by us may well become impossible. 10. Before going to see Shaikh Shakhbut as ins trueced in paragraph 2 of your demi-official letter, I should like time to see what effect the retribution inflicted on the Manasir has on Shaikh Shajtthbut, and particularly on Shaikh Hazza', who exercises a strong influence over him. I consider that his quotas for the 4 months from September to December should in any case be denied him for the reasons stated in paragraph 5; and T should like also to be authorized in advance, in case during my visit the Shaikh remains obdurate, to warn vSha ^hbut that his quotas will continue to be sold for the benefit of Dubai if there are any further raids. When one raid has been made by the Mana- sir without retaliation by the Shaikh of Dubai, he can hardly be blamed for pursuing the second raiding party or accused of breaking /the i-3- the agreement because of his pursuit.

There has been no complaint from Shaikh ShaKhbut of unprovoked action against his subjects or allies, and the restraint of the Dubai pur suit party on the 3rd December cannoD have - and I hear from other sources has not - passed unnoticed.Copy of Express Letter No.1241.0215 dated 19 ^12.'4^ from the political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah, to the political Agen t, Bahra in.

Dubai pursuit party who have now returned report that on the 3rd December they met an Abu Dhabi caravan of 40 camels carrying dates from Buraimi to Abu Dhabi. The meh of che caravan fled on seeing the Dubai party but were overtaken by fast camels and told that they would not be harmed by the Dubai party and could proceed. The Dubai party claims to have sent a message to this effect with the caravan to Shaikh Shakhbut. Shakhbut has not alleged that his caravan has been looted and the truth of this story has been confirmed from sources unconnected with Dubai. 3. On the 7th December the Dubai party which has been rein forced to a strength of 240 as soon as the ohaikh could collect his bedouin met the Manasir raiding party at SOAT north of LUVA and about 110 miles south west of Buraimi and 65 miles south vresz of Abu Dhabi. An engagement ensued from the forenoon Co night fall. The Dubai party claim that the Manasir force was broken and only saved by night fall. They also claim to have killed 49 Manasir out of a cotal force of 95. They counted them and buried them on the spot next day. 7 were wounded and 16 others captured and later released. 24 escaped in the darkness. 53 rifles are reported.to have been captured of which 17 were Dubai riflas for merly lost to the Manasir and 23 were identified as the property of the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi. The number of camels taken is reported to be 380. 21 others were killed In the lighting. Dubai casualties were 5 killed and 12 wounded, 3 seriously. They have reached Dubai by car sent out to fetch them. 4. When I was in Marfah on che 11th December Shaikh Shakhbut's son visited ohe Oil Company's camp to ask for the services of their doctor to treat two wounded who had reached Abu )habi. One was Bu Halaibah, the leader of the Shaikh oi* Abu Dhabi's forces last year. The other was a minor chief of the Vanasir. Other Manasir wounded are reported to have dispersed. 5. The number of Manasir reported killed appears to be dis proportionate to the size of their force, to the number reported as wounded and captured, and to the Dubai casualties. The Residency Agent has, however, interrogated Shaikh Rashid most carefully and Rashid has a record of the names of those the Dubai force claims were killed and buried by them the next day. He also has a record of names of the persons who were armed with Abu ^habi rifles which the Dubai force claims to be able to recognize and to have /confirmedconfirmed as Abu Dhabi f s from the captives. 6. After the raid reported in the Residency Agent's telegram No.815 dated the 8th September, 1947, the Shaikh of Dubai alleged that his subjects^were captured by the Manasir recognized in the raiding force certain camels of the ohaikh of Abu Dhabi, and saw his brand on ochers. They also 'Claimed to have seen the Kianasir carrying arns wnich they recognized as belonging co the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi. V/hen the Residency Agent visited Shaikh Zayid in Buraimi in October he taxed him with this. Shaikh /.ayid could not deny it, buz claimed chat the Manssir had looted them from him'. Nobody on the Crucial Coast believes this. Indeed, from enquiries the Residency Agent has wade it appears to be generally recognized that the Manasir are obedient to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and to his brothers. Only one camel belonging to Abu Dhabi T?as lound among the 401 killed and captured in the engagement under report. Shaikh Hashid has explained, however, that when a raid is being mounted only the best riding camels are good enough. These, he alleges, were provided by Abu Dhabi for the raid only and had in this case been returned to the Shaikh's brothers in Buraiai when the raiders withdrew souch west of Buraimi to Liwa and thought they were out of danger. 7. Persons arriving from Abu Dhabi report that there is considerable dissension between Shaikh i)hakhbuw ir, Abu Dhabi and his brother Hazza'. Ghakhbut is reported to be apprehensive of opposing His Majesty's Government and much troubled by the sanctions already imposed, nazza 1 , however, is more anxious to continue the war with Dubai and is reported to be encouraging the Manasir agains* the advice and wishes of Shaikh Shakhbut. Jhaikh Shakhbut, it is reported, can no longer face his toflismen in public majlis and lias retired to his fort and told Hazza', who has brought their present troubles upon them, -o answer their complaints. ^ 5* ' • ' '■ *. i* j-LO ID !0 - 1 N3. , ' S; 5X- — ' —' CONFIDENTIAL P.O.

Please refer to the correspondence about the Dubai-Abu Dhabi dispute ending with your demi-official letter No. 63-3, dated the 8th of January, 1948. 2. I am taking action as agreed to by you in your letter, but after consulting Jackson and hearing Jassim bin Mohammed's opinion I now think that it would bp better if Jackson kept away from ShaKhbiit; both he and Jassim agree with me about this. As will be apparent from paragraph 10 of his demi-official letter No. 1246. 0215, daced the 20th December, 1947, I had already asked him to see the Shaikh. The reason I am now against it is my conviction that such a visit would be taken to mean that we need the Shaikh's co-operation and are disposed to overlook the breach of his promise in order to get it; while the impression we ought to give is that we need nothing from him and that he is in our bad books, that he is, in fact, the last person to whom we would send an V officer over miles of difficult country, and to whom we would give an opening to make amends to us. For the same reason I would urge that, unless circumstances change, you should not visit him in February. 3. The line I now propose about these visits is part of what seems to me to be a coherent policy, treating the Abu Dhabi-Dubai dispute and the delimitation of the boundary between che two shaikhdoms as parts of the same problem - which, of course, they are. Jackson should, I chink, now start taking from Dubai evidence of his claims as to where the boundary ought to be, and should arrange, without appearing to do so, that Abu Dhabi hears of this. 1^ will not then be long, I believe, before Shakhbut sends someone to urge his claims; then Jackson will be able to make the Shaikh's assumption of responsibility for the Manasir a condition precedent to listening to him. He will, in fact, be able to agree to dealing with the Shaikh with at least one bargaining counter in his hand and that a valuable one. proceeding on these lines I have hopes of some progress in the difficult matter of the delimitation of the boundary. I hope you will be able to agree to them. The Hon'ble Lt-Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C .I .E., C.3 .I., { PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY Political Resident in'the Persian Gulf., Bahrain. '** ^ i n OA (: 70.

Shaikh Zayid bin Sultan, brother of the Ruler of Abu Dhabi who lives in Buraimi, has sent a messenger named Rasnid bin Oman to the Shaikh of Dubai with a verbal message to the effect that he (Zayid) wishes to make peace between him and the Manasir and enquired if he had any objection. He added that he is doing this himself and that Shaikh Shakhbut neiuier knows about it nor authorized him co do i^. After careful thought the Shaikh of Dubai sent back a verbal reply cnrougn the same messenger saying that, while he welcomes nis oli ~ T to make peace, he does noc feel inclined to depart from the terms of the peace treaty whereby the Ruler^o: Abu Dhabi should make peace between him and che Manasir. Lhe ShaiKn Q l Dubai sent such a reply as he doubted the sincerity of chis offer of Zayid for the following reasons (a) Zayid did not supply his messenger, as usual, with a letter saying that the messenger was carrying a verbal message from him and, (b) he tried to keep his brother Sbakhbut, who is responsible for the Manasir, out of the matter so that he may be absolved irom nis responsibil ities according to the peace ^rea^y should (Zayid's) efforts to make peace eventually fail.

Jackson, Ssq,, , Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah, to C.J. Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. please refer to your telegram No.13 dated the 7th February, 1948. 2. I and the Residency Agent spent the 10th and the 11th February inkbu Dhabi. We (Are received by Shaikh Shakhbut and his brothers Hazza and Khalid, his uncle Hamid bin Buti, and other members of the family. Shaikh Z a yid was in Buraimi. 3. I found Shakhbut inconvenienced by the economic sanc tions and much disturbed by the thought that are dis pleased with him. He was accommodating and conciliatory, and expressed himself as most anxious for a settlement. He also said that had we not come to visit him he had intended, and still intends, to send his brothers Zayid and Hazza to Sharjah to negotiate after they have again consulted the Manasir. 4. It is Shaikh Hazza that is preventing a settlement. He was not in Abu Dhabi at the time of the neo^tiatlons at which peace was concluded, and, had he been there, it is now clear that he would never have allowed Shakhbut to agree to accept responsibility for the Manasir. Hazza usually in Buraimi and, with Zayid, is responsible for dealing with the tribes in relations with Shakhbut. 5. His Objections to accepting responsibility for maintain ing any peace that may be concluded arise froni his conviction that, if once the Manasir were put in the position of being ^ le to commit depredations for which the Shaikhs of Abu rather than themselves were held responsible, their Shaikhs would be in a position to blackmail Shakhbut and his brothers to an extent far beyond what they can afford to pay them. Also, tribal subsections - at present difficult enough to ^ ont f 0 i ' would commit isolated thefts and the Abu Dhabi Shaikhs might be put in a position of having to take armed action against a tribe with whom they have had an offensive-defensive alliance for years, and on whom they largely rely for their security and their power to deal with other tribes. Were they to turn out the Manasir - even if they could do so - they would have to see other allies. For this only Dubai are stpo ?f. e 5 0Ugh Lt n nf» sidering that Dubai have only recently committed an act of aggression against them which caused them to turn for help o the Manasir help that was readily given -, they fo not feel that, at this stage at any rate, they can turn asains ^ Manasir to help Dubai, or that they can yet rely on Dubai as allies. 6. They are, therefore, quite unwilling fully to guarantee any peace that may be concluded between Dubai and the Manasir. They feel the responsibility Is too heavy for them to fulfil. 7. I remarked that the time to have consider edthe con- seauences was when they brought the Manasir Into the »ar. To this Hazza replied that Dubai were the aggressors and asked whether they were debarred from Hith^to^e^ve provoked aggression. This Is a cogent point. Hitherto we nav, /been........ 9. ^ ..2- been trying to make Abu Dhabi fully responsible for main taining the peace between Dubai and the Manasir. When first they protested that they could not do so I suspected that they were trying to mislead us and to prolong Dubai 1 s embarrassment by encouraging the Manasir* Now that the Manasir are a much weakened tribe that shaikh said no longer regards as capable of large xria scale depredation and the Shaikhs/of Abu Dhabi still refuse to accept full responsibility for them, I am inclined to accept the reasons they give for not doing so and to absolve them from any design surreptiously to continue th^war while themselves enjoying the benefits of peace. 8. To sum up. In reply to the Resident's question Shalhbut said that he would consult Shaikh Zayid in Buraimi and also the Manasir and would then send Shaikhs Zayid and Hazza to Sharjah to give a final reply. He expected it would take some time to consult the Manasir who were camped far away; but he promised to send his reply as soon as possible. 9. Hazza then raised the question of sanctions, and I informed him and Shakhbut that it would be reconsidered when their reply to the Resident's enquiry was received; but that, unless peace was concluded between Dubai and the Manasir, they would be expected to withdraw their support from the Manasir or would probably have to face a continua tion of the sanctions. Hazza countered by denying that there was any logical connection between the sanctions and the depredations of the Manasir, because they (Abu Dhabi) were at peace. To this I replied that we were satisfied that since the peace treaty was signed food supplies which H.M.G. had made available to Shakhbut had been delivered to the Manasir and that Shakhbut had sold his cloth quotas for cash and used the money to provide them with arms and to pay them. To this Hazza replied that they always paid the /friends Manasir, that they wished,to be/txywwatexwttkxtoitk both them with and Dubai, and that they had not since the peace treaty given them more than their usual allowances. I informed him that my information contradicted this assertion; and that, even if it were true, they should not maintain an offensive alliwice with the Manasir without also influencing - if not control ling - the Manasi^s relations with tribes with whom they (Abu Dhabi) were at peace. To do so might, as in this case, lead to their supporting financially a tribe that were com mitting acts of aggression against Dubai, with whom Abu Dhabi claimed to be at peace. Similarly we could not support Abu Dhabi with quotas of food and cloth if they used them indirect ly to continue the war against Dubai. The right thing f or them to do - and this is clearly recognized in tribal politics was either to control the Manasir's policy towards Dubai or at least to deny them the benefits of financial and material support, if not to turn them out of Abu Dhabi# 10. To conclude: I recommend that when the Abu Dhabi deputation comes to Sharjah we should try to effect a com promise between them and Dubai on the basis or Abu Dhabi s assisting as mediators in the conclusion of a peace between Dubai and the Manasir; and that if peace is concluded the Abu Dhabi Shaikhs* responsibility for maintaining it should be limited to their withdrawing financial a ^, m ^ t ® r } al , port from the Manasir if they again break with Dubai while Abu Dhabi remain at peace. We should also insist that, in /the-3- the present negotiations, unless in the course of them the Abu Dhabi Shaikhs withdraw their support from the Manasir, the initiative must, until the peace is con cluded, come from them. 11. I also asked Sha^khbut if he would agree to H.M.G.'s arbitrating in the boundary dispute. He was quite willing to agree - having already agreed verbally last year but this was something new to Hazza, and, while he admitted that only H.M.G. could settle the dis pute, he was against immediate arbitration, firstly be cause he did not see why - unless oil development was involved - an immediate settlement was necessary, and secondly because he feared that as long as sanctions are imposed and Abu Dhabi continue to incur the displeasure of fl.M.G. they might not be treated with complete im partiality. He continued that as they regard Khor Ghanadha as unquestionably theirs they have much to lose and nothing to gain from arbitration. 12. On the first point I assured them that H*M*G. are anxious to remove all causes of dissension between Abu Dhabi and Dubai because complete peace and confidence can not be established as long as they remain. On the second point I said that it was in the interest of Shakhbut to further oil development^ in Abu Dhabi; but that no Company would bring in large numbers of men or sink capital unless they were certain that responsibility for the security of their personnel and installations was clearly defined. At present it was not clearly defined on the eastern border of Abu Dhabi, and the Oil Company ! s operations might be held up in consequence. I also twqnnr*«flt assured them that if they agreed to arbitration by H.M.G. the claims of each party would be judged quite impartially. 13. Hazza was quick to see a bargaining point in our ,desire for the Shaikh^ consent to our arbitration; so I did not press it, lest the initiative hitherto with us should pass to them. Shakhbut, however, knows where his interest lies - he is particularly anxious to see oil developed and he promised to send a more conclusive reply with his brothers when they visit Sharjah. 14. I do not think we are likely to make much progress in getting the Abu Dhabi Shaikhs* consent to our arbitra tion until the question of the Manasir is settled. Once it is settled, I do not anticipate that arbitration will take very long; and I attach so much importance to the Shaikhs* agreeing to our arbitration - rather than that we should have to announce an ex parte decision, which might be most difficult to implement - that I would urge the exercise of patience at this stage.Copy of Sharjah telegram No # 399 dated 26th April, 1948 to Political Agent, Bahrain. My telegram No. 389 dated 23rd April. 2. I have had series of meetings with HAZZA of Abu Dhabi and RASHID of Dubai. Abu Dhabi have been unable to get any response from MANASIR C who have retired to HASA ) on the subject of peace with Dubai; but HAZZA has given me and HASHID detailed and (mutilation ) assurance that Abu Dbabi will not help or encourage MANASIR in any way if latter renew hostilities against Dubai. RASHID has accepted these assurances as sufficient and he is confident he can deal with MANASIR if they attempt any further war without Abu Dhabi aid or encouragement# RASHID has expressed his satisfaction of Abu Dhabi's attitude and good relations appear well on the way to being established. 3. The only point outstanding from M^NASIR raid is question of Abu Dhabi camels alleged to be on deposit with MANASIR and captured by Dubai in the last engagement with MANASIR. Matter has been referred with the consent of parties arbitration of UMM-^AL-QAUIWAIN who has placed on Dubai burden of proving they were being used for war as opposed to domestic purposes. RASHID has agreed to produce his evidence within 10 days. Both parties have agreed to abide by Umm - al - Qauiwain's findings if accepted by me. 4. These results hava cleared way for further negotiations oh boundary dispute. HAZZA has not yet agreed in writing to our arbitration and has been trying to get me to prognosticate result, which I have absolutely refused to do but I think that HAZZA has been instructed by Shakhbut to agree to our arbitration and will do so in a day or two. 6. It would be a help to remove from HAZZA * s mind misgivings about H.M.G's attitude to Abu Dhabi if economic sanction could be lifted; and, in view of RASHID's acceptance of outcome of MANASIR negotiations I think their continuation is no longer justified or expedient. Grateful for authority to lift economic sanction. A. «J • S«EXPRESS LETTER From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. To Political Agent, Bahrain.

From Shaikh Hazza bin Sultan acting on behalf of Shakhbut bin Sultan, Ruler of Abu Dhabi. To The Political Officer Trucial Coast, Sharjah* # 1, ^e found that we were unable to bring the Manasir to peace with Dubai on the expiration of the truce that we effected in connection with the peace treaty d^ted the 6th March 1947; and the Man^sir continued to raid Dubai with whom we were at peace. 2, ^e have since tried again to bring them to make peace direct with Dubai but have received no reply to the two messengers we sent to them in Kasa, where they are now encamped. Certain of their Shaikhs with whom we formerly maintained relations were killed in a recent engagement with Dubai. 3, We are therefore unable to bring about peace between th&lt; them and Dubai. 4, Having long had friendly relations with the Manasir we are unwilling to expel them from our territories, and, if they wish to return, we shall permit them to do so. At present the only tribesmen of the Manasir in our employment are• Ali bin Mubarak, Hamad bin Mubarak and Taib; but we reserve the right to employ others of them on condition that we will be responsible IbX for them in case they commit any hostile act while in o^ir employ. We also undertake that, in the event of further raiding by the Manasir against Dubai, with whom we are at peace, we will act in accordance with tribal custom regulating the relations between tribes at peace with each other; and.Q&gt; &amp; . - 2 - while, we will permit the Manasir to remain in their 'Ddjras 1 in the western part of our territory, we will not permit them to use any parts of Buraimi that are under our control as bases from which to raid Dubai; nor will we pay them any money or allowances other than the allowances that they reguiarly receive from us; and we will not allow them any cloth, sugar, grain, dates or coffee in excess of the supplies that we ordinarily allow them. Fufi^er, we undertake not to supply them with any arms or camels, exeept domestic camels that we have had on deposit with them since before the hostilities jfhich we will not allow to be used for war purposes; nor will we permit our subjects to join them in any raids. Indeed, we undertake not to give them any encouragement or help as long as raiding or warlike operating continue again st Dubai. 6« This is our reply to the Resident's question \ regarding our attitude conveyed to ^haikh Shakhbut bin Sultan by the Political Officer Trucial Coast on the 10th February 1948, it has been reduced to writing by the Political Officer Xrucial Coast in free consultation with me in the presence of Shaikh Ahmad bin iiashid of Umm al Qaiwain, and I agree that is expresses accurately the attitude of Shakhbut and myself in this matter.

After Compliments. You will recall that on 27th Safer, 1367, you v/rote to the Ruler of Dubai about certain camels that you claimed had been taken by his men from the I anasir. You will also re member that he replied that the matter had been referred to me. Shaikh Kazza has also drawn my attention to this claim which I referred with his consent to Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid, Ruler of Umi al ^aiwain, for arbitration. Shaikh Ahmad has given his opinion and I enclose a copy of' it. In accordance with the last paragraph of it the Ruler of Dubai'h-s asked for time to bring independent witnesses from such places as Ibrl. I have discussed his request with Shaikh Ahmad who has stated, as he wrote in his award, that the Ruler of Dubai is entitled to 'time for this purpose. Shaikh Ahmad has defined the time that should'he allowed to Ruler of Dubai as sufficient tine for a messenger to make the return journey to and from the area lentioneo and a fe» x days extra if necessary. Shaikh Ahmad asked to be excused from fixing the time any more definite ly than this; and requested that, if a definite number of days was required to be fixed, I should fix it myself. I have accordingly 2i ven Ruler of Dubai SO days from noon to-day in which to produce independent witnesses before Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid. J If the Ruler of Dubai fails to do so, or if the witnesses are not accepted by Shaikh Ahmad, the case can be proceeded with in accordance with the enclosed finding of Sha ? kh V-h ■ sd bi-i i ia sh id. Translation of letter dated the 25th Jamad Thani, 1367, (5th lay, 1948) from Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid, Ruler of Umm al ^aiwain, to the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah. After Compliments. Your esteemed letter dated the 4th Lay, 1948, correspond ing to the 25th Jamad Thani, 1367, has been^received. As regards the dispute over camels between Shaikh Shakhhut bin Sultan, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, and Shaikh Said bin Tlaktum, Ru■er of Dubai, in which you want my opinion in accordance with Arab custom. Yes, the Ruler of Dubai ought to produce two impartial witnesses not from amongst his people who can depose On x oath that the. I anasir had used these camels in the war and raided Dubai with them. Should the Ruler of Dubai produce witnesses in support of his contention, the iuler o^ Abu Luiah: of Dubai ^ioes not produce this evidence in support of his contention, the Ruler of Abu Dhabi and four persons whom the Ruler of Dubai approve should take solemn oath thafr these camels were not given to the Manasir to help the to ride on and raid Dubai with, that they were kept as deposit with^the i:anasir for grazing and watering and that they (Abu Dhabi) have not done any hostile act against the Ru' er od? Duba. ! since tne peace was made until now. If they taxe tnis oatu, tne cs.iiiels could then be returned to the Ruler of Abu Dhabi,-2- &amp;&gt; P c O • The fixed time limit of 10 days expires today. The Ruler of Dubai today produced witnesses to prove his contention Tut the witnesses were from amongst his people. According to custom, witnesses should not be from his people. The Ruler of Dubai should, therefore be asked to produce these witnesses; he can be allowed an extension of the period in order to produce them if he asks for it. Should he fail to prove his claim by witnesses, Shaikh Shakhbut should take oath as stated above. -D.0.No.442,0216 British Agencyi Sharjah. Dated the 4th May! 1948.

There followed two full days' negotiations at \ the Agency mostly turning on what to you and I might perhaps \ appear to be an unimportant pointi whether Shaikh Said should have to ask Shaikh Shakhbut from time to time for details of the men enjoying his protection or whether Shaikh Shakhbut should keep him Informed without reference from Shaikh Said. Eventually, as you will see from paragraph 4 of the agreement. a compromise was reached and recorded as an agreement between the two Shaikhs. A copy in translation is enclosed. Shaikh Kashid has now stated that he is satisfied. He particularly requires details of the Manasir enjoying Shaikh Shakhbut•s protection so that he can deal conclusively with any others that may attack his bedouin or steal their camels grazing in the diras contiguous to Abu Dhabi. There remains for settlement the question of the camels on deposit with the ^anasir and captured by Dubai. H Is still under arbitration with Shaikh Ahmad bin Bashid of imm al Qaiwain. Shaikh Hazza* and Zayid heve agreed in principle to l.M.G's arbitration in their boundary disputed with Dubai on the condition that the case should be decided by the Political Offlcer&gt;who are acquainted with the dispute. I have, in consultation with them, drafted a letter which they will take to Abu Dhabi for Shaikh Shakhbut;to sign. I enclose a copy of he draft. I have had to u et their wishes in respect of the officers who will decide the case and trust that their agreement in this form will not be held to restrict H.lf.G's freedom of action.

My dear Pelly, Please refer to the correspondence resting with para 6 of my demi-official letter No.443.0216 dated the 4th May, 1948. 2. I visited Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan in Abu Dhabi on the 2nd and 3rd June to try to get him to agree to H.M.G's arbitrating in the boundary dispute with Dubai. He had not signed the draft that^Hazza had taken to him and, indeed, Hazza had taken it off to Buraimi with him. After a good deal of discussion Shakhbut eventually agreed to H.M.G's arbitration and to abide by the award. He gave me a letter to signify his agreement. A copy is A 3. It remains to get the agreement of the Shaikh of Dubai. I have approached Shaikh Rashid who has said that he must first get his father's approval. Shaikh Said is in Muscat at the moment calling on the Sultan, but he is expected back here on about the 13th June when I hope we shall be able to get his agreement also.

Galloway); Political Agent, Bahrain (Cornelius James Pelly); Residency Agent, Sharjah (Jasim ibn Muhammad Kadmari); Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah (Gordon Noel Jackson); Shaikh Shakhbut, ruler of Abu Dhabi; Shaikh Hazza bin Sultan, brother of Shaikh Shakhbut.The British conclude that the Shaikh of Dubai deliberately broke his undertaking not to engage in any aggressive acts and that he repeatedly disregarded their warnings to cease all interference in Beni Qitab and Abu Dhabi affairs. Furthermore, he persisted in allying himself with the Beni Qitab and exerting himself to prevent them from making peace with Abu Dhabi.The British discuss withholding quotas including grain and the closing of the port of Dubai. The file also includes: a tabulated summary of the claims of Abu Dhabi and Dubai over the boundary in the Khor Ghanadhah region; a translation of the peace settlement between the Shaikhs of Dubain and Abu Dhabi; a translation of the letter to Shaikh Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi exhorting him to control the tribes within his territory who engaged in hostilities against Duba following the peace treaty. Shaikh Shakhbut refused to return some stolen camels and asserted he was not responsible for the actions of the Manasir tribe. This led to the confiscation of Abu Dhabi's cloth and sugar quotas. There is also a memorandum describing how Shaikh Zayid bin Sultan, brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi sent a messenger to the Shaikh of Dubai offering to make peace. A demi-official letter from the Political Officer, Trucial Coast to the Political Agent Bahrain, notes the need to use force if necessary to uphold British authority in the Trucial Coast, particularly in the light of oil exploration.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Beni Qitab (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000109#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
