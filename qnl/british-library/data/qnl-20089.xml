India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W 31st December 1915 Sir x x X X X As regards the suggestiom that the Sultan should further be required to undertake not to conclude ^'resh treaties with foreign powers without the consont of His Majesty's Government, I am toj^advert to the last nara- graph of Sir R. Ritchie's letter of 19th July 1911, and to say that Lord Crewe trusts that, in view of the im proved relatinns now happily existing with the Fr^nci* Government in connection with Masqat, Sir E. Grey w 11 see his way to open the question with them. Tho T term 'Foreign Powers' should presumably be understood ^.o m^a.n Powers other than France and Great Britain. The increased interest shown by Germany in the Persian Gulf seems to make such an agreement with the Sultan even more desi rable than it was two years ago, and His Lordship would prefer to make it one of the conditions of the renewed subsidies; but if difficulty and delay on the pert of the French Government are to be anticipated, he realises that this may be impracticable. x x x «}• latf x I have etc (sd) T.W. Holderne ^ The Under Secretary of State Foreign Office.Z I^ [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government] TURKEY. [January 23.j CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [83] No. 1. Foreign Office to India Office. -Sir, Foreign Office, January 23, 1914, I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge tire receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, relative to the continuance to the present Snltan of Muscat oh the subsidies granted to his predecessor. As r°'nrr]r proposal that the Sultan should be asked to agree to the creation ^ of a levy i m i] li i Ti ill li or Indian officers in the event of his failing to come to terms with the 11 ilul i lill'K iiii h 'In 1 , has no objection to offer from an « ^ international point of view so long as tlieccTn^g^ ^jiomi n a ll v a Muscat force, and the ^ officers, by whom it is commanded, nominally in the SimaiT*5 ,,i ^v vice. P recedents are not lacking to justify the conclusion of such an arrangement bv alTirtd rnondent sovereign. • As i-egards the proposal that the Sultan should be required to furnish an under taking not to conclude with foreign Powers, other than Great Britain and France, fresh treaties without the assent of His Majesty's Government, Sir E. Grey concurs in the opinion of the Marquess of Crewe that such an arrangement would in itself be desirable in British interest, but he would wish to make the following observations on the suggestion :— This country is under a treaty obligation to France to respect the independence of the Sultan, of Muscat and the exaction from His Highness of an undertaking of the kind proposed would undoubtedly constitute an interference with his sovereign rights. Were His Majesty's Government to ask the French Government to agree to an arrangement whereby the Sultan would be bound not to enter into any treaty with a third Power without the assent of Great Britain, there is little doubt that the French Government, on their side, would demand that France should be put on a footing of equality with Great Britain in this matter. Such a demand would involve the conclusion by the Sultan of an agreement, not with the Government of India but with Great Britain and France, stipulating that without their assent he shall not enter into a treaty with any third Power. Such an arrangement would be to the advantage of France, and there is little doubt that the French Government would agree to it. Sir E. Grey is, however, in doubt whether the Government of India would welcome the assumption by France of so leading a position as Muscat, even though the particular danger they apprehend— that of the intervention of other European Powers—would thereby be removed. Should the Government of India raise no objection to such an arrangement the agreement to be concluded between His Majesty's Government and the French Govern ment might be to the effect that the two Powers, while not desiring to interfere with the independence of Muscat, to which they are pledged by the treaty of 1862, are most anxious not to see any material modification of the existing relations of the Sultanate with other Powers and have, therefore, agreed to obtain from the Sultan an assurance that he will not enter into fresh treaties with any Power other than Great Britain and France without their knowledge and approval. It would probably be sufficient to effect this agreement by an exchange of notes which need not necessarily be published. Should the Government of India reject this suggestion, Sir E. Grey is willing, should it be desired, to approach France with their proposal in its original form, but he has no confidence that they will accept it, least of all without difficulty and delay. I am, &amp;c. EYRE A. CROWE. [2001 z-—2] 6 SfTs, (/J C * h-3 iiixtraot from Foreigia's letter 1292 D of 12.3.14 3.

Barm reports by letter from Masqat tinder date 5th April series of events from 29th March# General situation appears^ disquieting and sultan 1 s efforts to raise money and enlist foreign aid do not reassure me# Following are most significant items of newss~ (1)# Sultan has apparently appealed to Wall of Basrah for help in money or men. (2)# A Jemadar Qaslm, lately returned from Basrah, is said to have arranged with a Pa than Hbdue Hahnan, Jemadar Ohokidar of Messrs Qray Mackenzie Basrah, to enlist £00 Pathans tor service with Sultan. (S)# An attempt is to be made to enlist Baluchis from Barnpur. (4). 1 All bin Salim, late Sultan's cousin, accompanied by •Abdul kz%,z f French Consulate dragoman, visited French Consul three times on Srd April. We cannot i^egard with equanimity any of these measures8 (1). It is difficult to see what possible response Wali Basrah can give to this wild appeal and I think Poli tical Agent might simply address a remonstrance to the Stiltan showing its futility and folly# 2) and S). Unorganised Pathans and Baluchis will only add to disorderly elements in town and probably decamp with any rifles and ammunition given them, nossibly pur chasing others# They will be entirely useless against local Arabs# Political Agent should emphatically dis courage these plans# (4)# I think Political Agent should endeavour to learn independently and by direct enqiairy from His Highness significance of •All bin Salim^ visits to French Oonsul. A talk over situation with his French Colleague might possibly elicit useful Information. He should report result by telegraph# fime has, I think, now come for a straight talk with Sultan pointing out the idiocy of wasting money on his Arab forces# the # 0mani tribes are following out their old policy of bleeding Sultan. One section draw pay from him and render no service in exchange, the other are in possession of his territoryterritory and feed on his estates* Be should be warned that w© will not lend money to be squandered In these dlrec tlons and shall forbid our subjects to lend him rataney either f until he gives us guarantee that these loans and the revenues of the country are being spent in serious efforts to pacify it, esTjecially the Wadi samail. For the present# it seems impossible to do anything except stick to the Masqat Matrah enclave organise the Levy Corps and prepare for an advance to Samail in October next. The object of this advance would be to install Nadir, or some other well qualified selection of Sultan there as Governor, have Forts at Bidbid and Samail put in thorough order and garrisoned by at least a company each of the new Levy Corps, whose head quarters should be in Sib# It would pro bably be necessary to leave a double compnny with machine gun section at Bait al FalaJ to frighten off any marauding raids down Wadi # Adai behind back of ladi Samail. Political advisers, preferably selected natives of India, paid from Oustoms revenues and in close touch wi&amp;h Political 4gent, would be required, one at Masqat for Sultan and one at Samail for Hadir. Latter could gradually, in consultation with Nadir subsidise selected tribal petty Chiefs to maintain communications from Samail to Sib and Masqat* When these arrangements are complete, our troops could withdraw. It is essentially a cold weather job and would necessitate employment of troops for from two or three months next winter and maintenance of Bait al FalaJ garri son to the end of the year. But it seems the only hope of re-establishing Sultan's authority, a useful asset to us. As price fif this material assistance. Sultan should under- take to manage Masqat and Matrah customs under our advice and devote Zanzibar subsidy to expense of Levy Corps and secret but effective understanding that he will correspond with no foreign governments unrepresented at Masqat except through us. In our turn, we bear all costs of expedition to reestablish his authority in Samial and balance of ex penditure on Levy Otorps. KNOX-7 T^aRAM.'?' . From, Foreijpi. To, 3enn, lasnat.

From the cor respond ence available in. this of rice it would seem.that while, on.the one hanti,.the exaction of.the proposed undertaking from His Highness would undoubtedly tend to minimize -if not entirely remove- the danger, now being increasingly felt, from.the development of Germar erterprise in.the Gulf, it would,on. the other, necessitate. the adoption of measures involving a'joint agreement with France which it is .thought would be objectionable as enabling. that^Power, to assume a more leading position in Mascat. than.iiusx it has. hith erto enjoyed.

My immediately ptreceding letter No.^ 7 -^ dated A July IS'l^t was to a certain extent suggested by Sir Eyre A. Crowe's re marks in the Foreign Office letter referred to. I had invited tiie views of the Political Agent&gt; \asqat, on your letter first quoted, to which he replied that, in his opin on, 'we tq 11 far less to fear from the possible elevation of the French ^position in Masqat which, it is thought, night result fr^m a joint Agresment with France, than from the^f extension of 'German interests in the Gulf which would follow the conclu- 'sion of a secret Masqat-German Treaty. His Highness the 'Sultan, as you are aware, has evinced a tendency to cultivate 'direct delations with the German Consular authorities in the Gulfand thougji His Highness has given us verbal assurances 11 that he will invariably consult the British Goverment before ^dealing with Foreign Powers having no treaty relations with 11 Masqat, it would - considering the unstable character of such 'oriental assurances- be wiser to have this understanding with ^His Highness placed on a more substantial basis even at the 'rislc of enhancing the french position in Masqat 1 *. On receipt of this opinion, I addressed the political Agent by telegram referring to the draft of the edict that I proposed that lie Highness the Sultan should issue# I pointed out that, diplomatically at any rat®, we had closed the question of the Ar«»^ Traffic by the issue of the Masqat Arms Warehouse Hegula- tions and that I hoped by the proposed new edict to deal effect ively eith the other vexed question of the transfer of allegiance these closed, to my mind, the door to the main dangers of German intrigue and intervention. I proceeded to state what is, to my mind, iiotfc the most serious difficulty w© have to face. I fail^ to see how, even if we man aged to conclude a special arrangement with France, we could prevent Qernany approaching the Sultan and the two Powers that guarantee his independence with a request to conclude an ordinary commercial treaty with Masqat giving Germany the rights of the most favoured nation# We could not well refuse such an apparently reasonable request as German steamers call freauently at the port of Masqat, fhe Germans will ask for nothing more and will trust, not without reason, to their commercial enterprise and vigorous methods, to give them in due course a more ^substantial position. We should thus, as far as 1 can see, have given the now waning influence and prestige of Franc© at Masqat new life and. vigour without any corresponding advantage to ourselves# The Political Agent concurred on the assumption that I was correct in my view that we could not prevent a German commercial treaty with Masqat in the teeth of our proposed understanding with France and His Highness.lb I do not wish in any way to underestimate or minimise the inconvenience, not to say the dangers,of German comaBBrcial enterprise in the Gulf, but I think that we shall have to rely on the knowledge which His Highness the Sultan no doubt possess es that we should greatly resent a treaty with Germany conclud ed without oftr knowledge and approval and trust that Hig Highness will not be slow to realise on which side his inter ests lie* If these considerations will not stop His Highness, I very much doubt if a three cornered agreemant or an under taking given by himself to the two Powers jointly will be more effective; and, when we have concluded our agreement with Franc® to demand an undertaking from His Highness the Sultan, it is not quite clear to me whether It will be possible to remove the suspicicms which such an arrangement will un doubtedly engender in His Highness* mind, nor what steps exactly France and England would propose to take should their demand be politely declined, to put the matter in a concrete form, I think Colonel Benn might procure such an -undertaking by himself without great difficulty but I should greatly doubt if Oolonel Benn and Monsieur'Jeannier could, •'iy personal experience of French Consuls at Masqat and such information as I have gleaned from Masqat records would lead me to view with no surprise a French Gonsul representing to His Highness that he really count ed for littife in the undertaking which was a purely British invention# It Is for the above reasons that I prefer the course oC meet ing such dangers as arise - in the present instance a difficulty akin to that of the famous French Flag Question- by His High ness* own proclamations suggested by ourselves and promulgated to Foreign Oonsuls residing at his portg Any tergiversations of ^Highness we can view with pain and surprise and, should the necessity press, with threats of force on the principle that we have not bolstered up a tottering State for geaerations to allow His Highness to destroy with his own hands the edifice wewe have so long supported, and I venture to suggest that this is the more satisfactory solution of the problem# I have the honour to be Sir, Tour most obedient servant.
