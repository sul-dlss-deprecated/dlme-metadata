On the cover of this folder we have stressed the exceptionally high reputation which Bush Radio products enjoy in Britain, for the simple reason that we are very proud of it. In the Bush factory it has ever been our foremost aim to make the sets we build as reliable as we know how, and the very rapid increase in the demand for sets built by Bush, best illustrates that we have succeeded. During the war years this quality of reliability, inseparable from the name of Bush, proved its real worth, for domestic radio sets had literally to fend for themselves, and we have had overwhelming evidence in the form of letters from Trade and Public alike, telling us of themagnificent and unfailing service which Bush sets have given. So we send Bush sets overseas—confident that they will compare most favourably both in performance and value with any make of Radio in the World, and that our trade mark, the bush, will signify to our friends in other countries no less than it does to thousands in Britain—the svmbol of Reliable Radio. The Bush model E.B.S.84, described in this folder, is unquestionably one of the finest sets which even Bush have ever built. It has been specially designed to suit the reception condi tions overseas, and will be found a delightful set to handle, possessing plenty of volume, magnificent tone, and the ability to get stations. SPECIFICATION The E .B .S.84 is a six valve (including rectifier) receiver for A.C. mains, 200-260 volts, 40-100 cycles. Another model similar to the Bush but designed to work on .her D .C. or A .C. mains will be released later. (Type D.A .C .84). CHANGE OF WAVEBAND Each short wave channel is allotted a separate Bush Button, and the action of pressing any one of these automatically illuminates that section of the scale. See back page for list of wavebands covered. BANDSPREAD TUNING For those who are not familiar with the advantages of this form of tuning we give a brief note in explanation. It is well known by listeners through out the world that short wave recep tion on the normal type of receiver, without bandspread, calls for very careful tuning. Stations are hard to find—they are very close together on the scale and even when received are sometimes difficult to find in future. With a bandspread receiver, the entire length of the scale becomes available to any particular short wave channel. The effect of this is to make the tuning of short wave stations as simple as on the Medium wave T^i, band — they are also easily re ceived on future occasions, and in the case of this Bush model, they are heard clearly and more reliably owing to the use of a special Radio Frequency valve, which boosts the very weak signals before they are passed to the main circuit. In other words, Bandspreading robs the old style short wave tuning of its diffi culties and makes it a pleasure. TUNING SCALE This is a large glass scale divided into three panels, one of them being divided into 100 divisions. This is the one used for tuning on the six bandspread channels, and station reference is made by means of the special calibration card supplied. The scale is marked with station names for the medium waveband, while the intermediate band is shown in megacycles and metres. PICK-UP A gramophone pick-up can be used with the E.B.S.84. Two audio frequency amplifying valves operate when the pick-up is working. Volume and Tone controls are in use for record reproduction. ALTERNATIVE AERIAL CONNECTIONS Two aerial sockets are provided, so as to ensure either maximum sensi tivity (the highest degree of amplifica tion) or selectivity, which increases the receiver's ability to reduce inter- station interference. CABINET The receiver is housed in a large, highly polished walnut cabinet, mea suring 22J ins. wide by 17* ins. high by 12^ ins. back to front (58 x 44 x 31 cms.). Weight 30 lbs.

Medium. 1500-535 Kilocycles (200-560 metres). TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION The circuit consists of a Pre-selector Radio Frequency stage, MULLARD EF50 valve operating on the six Bandspread ranges, giving amplification ahead of the Frequency Changer. On the Intermediate and Medium wavebands, the aerial is coupled via a selective tuned circuit to the Frequency Changer valve, MULLARD ECH35, the triode section of this valve and oscillator circuits producing the required frequency which, in conjunction with the signal, results in an l.F. frequency of 465 kilocycles. The oscillator circuit is a special stabilised arrangement where drift due to ' warming up ' has been reduced to a minimum by the use of a negative temperature coefficient condenser. After the signal of 465 kilocycles is amplified by the high gain Intermediate Frequency valve, MULLARD EF39, and its associated permeability tuned transformers, it is passed on to the second detector diode and automatic volume control diode, MULLARD EBC33 (double diode triode valve). The A.V.C. voltage is applied through suitable network to the Radio Frequency Valve, and to the Frequency Changer valve on the Intermediate and Medium wavebands, and to the Intermediate Frequency valve on all wavebands. After extensive I.F. filtering the voltage developed across the signal diode is passed via the volume control resistor to the grid of the triode section of the EBC33. Resistance capacity coupling is employed to couple this triode to the output Pentode valve, MULLARD EL33, whitih delivers a power output of approximately 3-5 watts to a special matching transformer feeding the speech coil of the Energised Moving Speaker. Variable Tone correction is applied to the anode of this valve. The Rectifying valve, MULLARD 1W4'350 supplies the H.T. current, and is smoothed by the large speaker field, in conjunction with surge-proof electrolytic condensers. A Mains Filter circuit is fitted across the primary of the Mains Transformer. Bush Radio Limited, Power Road, London, W.4. February, 19464BUSH A As a very real force in the Radio Industry, Bush have had the vital job of helping in the design, development and production of the many intricate Radiolocation instruments, upon the efficiency and reliability of which, men's very lives as often as not depended. It has ever been the policy of Bush Radio to ensure that every set they build shall be as reliable as they know how to make it. As a direct result of this policy, the sets built by Bush in Peace have given a fine account of themselves during the War. Deprfcsd of attention by Bush Details of the first four post-war receivers to be built by BUSH are given in this folder. Two of them work on A.C. Mains (Types A.C.81 and P.B.83). Oite on either D.C. or A.C. Mains (Type D.A.C.81) and one is battery operated (B.A.81). TYPES A.C.81 AND D.A.C.81 MAINS SUPERHETS CONTROLS. These sets have four control knobs on the front of the cabinet. From left to right these are ; combined ON/OFF switch and TONE—VOLUME—TUNING with slow motion drive—WAVEBAND switch. WAVEBANDS. The sets receive on three wavebands, SHORT 16.5—51 m. MEDIUM 200—560 m. LONG 850—2,000 m. SCALE. This is of glass and wavebands are arranged in parallel vertical columns. Pilot lamps illuminate the band being used by synchronising with the waveband switch. CURRENT CONSUMPTION. In the A.C.81, the use of universal type valves and a Permanent Magnet Speaker, achieves great economy in current, the set using only 40 watts as against the more normal 60 watts for a set of this rating. For the D.A.C.81, consumption is 70 watts. CONVERSION of A.C.81. Due to its special design, it is easy for your BUSH appointed Dealer to modify the A.C.81 so that it will operate on either D.C. or A.C. Mains. Normally such modifications are very unsatisfactory. SPEAKER. An 8' diameter Permanent Magnet Speaker is fitted. Celestion or Rola. EXTERNAL SPEAKER. There are sockets for connecting an external speaker to work with or independently of the fitted speaker. Suitable impedance for any external speaker is 2.5 ohms. PICK UP. Provision is also made by means of sockets for connecting a pick-up. ALTERNATIVE AERIAL SOCKETS. Two aerial sockets are fitted which give a choice of maximum Selectivity or Sensitivity. TYPE B.A.81 BATTERY SUPERHET This is the battery operated model of the ' 81 ' range. For those living in Country Districts unserved by Mains electricity, the B.A.81 will provide splendid reception and like all Bush receivers prove to be most reliable. This cabinet houses models D.A.C.81 and B.A.81. There may be some slight interchange between this and the cabinet illustrated for the A.C.81 dependent upon deliveries from the cabinet makers. Dimensions as for the A.C.81. Release Dates: D.A.C.81 and B.A.81, November, 1945. o o o o CONTROLS. From left to right these are, combined ON/OFF switch and volume control—TUNING—WAVEBAND switch. WAVEBANDS. SHORT 16.5—51 m. MEDIUM 200—550 m. LONG 950—2,000 m. CURRENT CONSUMPTION. Very moderate 9—9^ m.a. the performance of the set is well maintained throughout the life of the battery. ALTERNATIVE AERIAL TAP. Two aerial sockets are fitted giving maximum Selectivity or Sensitivity as in the A.C.81. TYPE P.B.83 BUSH BUTTON SUPERHET The P.B.83 is a five valve (inc. rect.) superhet for A.C. Mains 200—250 volts, 40—100 cycles. Wavebands: Short 16.5—51 m. Medium 200—560 m. Long 850—2,000. BUSH BUTTON TUNING. This is the first Bush Receiver to be produced, since the War, which is fitted with the popular BUSH BUTTON Tuning, proved as simple, efficient and thoroughly reliable. Seven BUSH BUTTONS are provided, three acting as waveband selectors for normal manual tuning, the remaining four being pre-tuned to stations on the medium and long wavebands. One of the great features of the Bush Button system is the ease with which the pre- tuned Buttons may be changed by the owner to other suitable stations at will— directions for doing this being included in the Instruction sheet supplied with the set. SCALE. The full glass scale is arranged as for the A.C.81 model, but, with Bush Buttons taking the place of a waveband switch, it is only necessary to push the Button for the desired waveband and that section of the scale is automatically illuminated. TELEFLIC. This is an exclusive BUSH feature, which by giving a definite reading, greatly simplifies the re-tuning of stations on the short waveband once they have been received. CONTROLS. Apart from BUSH BUTTONS, the Dial Controls on the P.B.83 are reduced to three. They are VOLUME, and TUNING with slow motion action, while the recessed knob on the left side of the cabinet is the combined ON/OFF switch and TONE control. SPEAKER. An 8' diameter Permanent Magnet (Celestion or Rola). REMOTE SPEAKER. Sockets are provided for connecting a remote speaker and a plug is fitted for disconnecting the internal speaker. Speech coil impedance of remote speaker to be 2.5 ohms. PICK-UP. Sockets are also included for connecting a pick-up. ALTERNATIVE AERIAL SOCKETS. A further pair of sockets giving maximum selectivity or sensitivity as for the A.C.81 are also included. CABINET. The illustration shows the really pre-war appearance and finish of the walnut cabinet which measures overall 21' long, I6|' high, I If' back to front. A r~ BUSH BUTTON SUPERHET Type P.B.83. Release Date : November, 1945. r L. I J &amp;/1/1TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS Types A.C.81 and D.A.C.81. These receivers are five valve (inc. rect.) Superhets. Intermediate frequency Is 465 kcs. \ single tuned pre-selector for each waveband feeds Into the frequency changer which in conjunction v 'ith the oscillator, converts the signal to 465 kcs. A two-bank Yaxley type switch Is used for waveband selection—one bank switching the tuned aerial circuits and scale lamps, the other bank switching the tuned oscillator circuits and adjusting the oscillator anode voltage. The coupling to both aerial tuned circuits and oscillator circuits is a periodic. An I.F. bandpass transformer passes the signal on to the I.F. Amplifier from which a second I.F. transformer feeds the signal to the com bined diode and L.F. stage. The signal is rectified at the signal diode and passes via the volume control to the grid of the L.F. Amplifier section. The A.V.C. Is fed via suitable decoupling to the frt'quency changer and I.F. stages. The anode of the L.F. Amplifier is resistance coupled to the output stage valve. This stage delivers a power output of 1.5 watts through the matching transformer to the speaker. The power supply of the A.C.8I consists of a mains transformer with a primary tapped from 210 to 250 volts, the secondary Is a single winding tapped to feed the series heaters and the anode of the half wave rectifier! The smoothing circuit consists of a 16+ 16 mfd. electrolytic and a 10,000 ohm resistor. For the D.A.C.81 the valve heaters are connected in series with a voltage dropping resistor and mains chokes. Type P.B.83. The aerial is coupled to a tuned pre-selector circuit into a Triode Hexode frequency changer, which. In con junction with the oscillator circuit, converts all incoming signals into the intermediate frequency of 465 kcs. Seven Press Buttons are provided, three as waveband switches for manual tuning and four as pre-tuned station selectors. Permeability tuning is employed in the oscillator circuit of the pre-tuned stations. The first I.F. Transformer passes the signal on to the I.F. Amplifying valve and then into the 2nd I.F. Trans former to the combined double diode and A.F. valve. Both I.F. Transformers are permeability tuned. The rectified output from the signal diode is passed via the volume control to the A.F. Amplifier section. The A.V.C. diode is feed from the primary of the second I.F. Transformer, and via decoupling circuits to the control grids of the frequency changer and I.F. amplifier. Resistance coupling is used from the anode of the A.F. Amplifier to the output valve. This valve delivers a power output of 1.5 watts through the matching transformer to the Speaker. The mains equipment consists of a mains transformer and full wave rectifier, the smoothing circuit being a 16+ 16 mfd. electrolytic and a 10,000 ohm resistor. Type B.A.81. The aerial is coupled to a tuned preselector which feeds the frequency changer, incoming signals are converted to 465 Kc.—the intermediate frequency—and after selective amplification by the I.F. amplifier valve and associated transformers, the signals are passed on to the second detector and A.V.C. rectifier. The triode amplifier section of this valve provides considerable L.F. magnification of the signal before feeding to the Output Pentode. The power output from the latter is then fed via a matched output transformer to the Permanent Magnet moving coil speaker. RECOMMENDED VALVES (All Mullard) A.C. and D.A.C.81. B.A.8I. P.B.83.
