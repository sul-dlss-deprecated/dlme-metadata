The enclosure is a copy of a letter from Lieutenant Tronson, Commanding the Brigantine
                           Tigris, to Commodore J. P. Porter, Indian Squadron Persian Gulf, dated 20 September 1851. Tronson writes that he has met with the Native Agent at Sharjah [Mullā Husayn], who states that the Imam of Muscat is presently on board a fleet of ships positioned off the coast, is preparing an attack on the coastal towns of Shinas and Roostack, and that the sheikh of Sohar has rejected the Imam's demands to hand over the two towns. Tronson continues that the various sheikhs of the region have taken sides and committed men to the dispute. Tronson also reports on his subsequent interview with the sheikh of Lingah [Bandar-e Lengeh], relating to a dispute relating to a nacoodah [nākhudā].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673698.0x00002d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
