The adviser, Bahrein Government, Bahrein. Dear Sir, The &gt;Jiglo Persian Oil Company Limited through their Agent Haji Yousuf bin iJuned Kanoo, C.I.E., are contemplating opening a service station in the ouildin^ oppos ite to the Police Station, and I should be pleased if you would advice- us if the Baladiyah would sanction this proposal. The building which it is intended to use is the property of Haji Yousuf bin Jimed Kanocp, and i we undertake to take all reasonable precautions against the possibility of fire. The proposal is to supply forty-gallon barrels of benzine by the s.s. ' T Khuzistaii' and unload, about ou at a time, at the end of the Customs Jetty. arrangements will be made to keep a number not exceeding ten in uhe Service Station, and the remainder will be conveyed to Suweifiyah Depot by a Lorry. n le understand from the Director of Justoms 'tbat there is no objection to the landing of the benzine at the end of their jetty. The hours of the Service Station will probably be, during the summer, Vai.T. to 12 lloon, and 3 P.l', to 6 P.M., but the time will be adjusted so that it is unnecessary to open the Service Station before sunrise or after sunset. We shall be gied obliged if your reply to this letter is addressed to the Distribution Department ^.badan and copy to Haji Yousuf bin xihmed Kanoo. Yours faithfully, Sd Eric Coxho.
