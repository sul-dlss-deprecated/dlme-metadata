Previous References. Later References.4 Extract from a note dated 17th August 1946 by Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co. Ltd., Bahrain. &amp; . I f J 1 &lt; jt' Mr. Klein then mentioned that his Company have purchased two 5,000 ton freighters, one of which will be employed for some t-ime in carrying locomotives from America to France for the French Government. The other will be employed in a regular service carrying drummed gasoline from Bahrain to Red Sea ports. This ship will call at A.den, Pjibouti, Port Sudan and Massawa and will go down the African coast as far as Mombasa. I asked if this ship would be on time charter to Caltex and he replied that his Company would prefer not to charter but to carry at so much per ton, as by this means they might be able to pick up a return cargo or cargo between intermediate ports. He explained that the vessel would have refrigerated space and if inducement offered might go as far south as Durban though he thought this unlikely. I said that we would be glad to act as Agents for the ship at Bahrain and Mr. Klein said that he thought his Company would prefer to open their own office here. When I remarked that this might not have the approval of the authorities, he said that he fully realised the political difficulties that might be involved but he had no doubt that ways and means could be found to overcome them. By this we gather that they might form a separate Company to operate in Bahrain with their Head Office in Bermuda or elsewhere. r No«C/48b.
