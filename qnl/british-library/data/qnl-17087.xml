                           Ariadnehas issued a letter of protection in error to to the vessel (encountered at Muscat), which the British believe to have been involved in a piratical cruise.The letter also reports that Shaikh Tannoon [Ṭaḥnūn bin Shakhbūṭ Āl Nahyān] fears that the Wahabi [Wahhabi] intend to resume piracy once the towers at Rusul Khyma [Ra's al-Khaymah] are completed; the Resident however explains that it is his opinion that the Wahabi are unlikely to be in a position to re-establish themselves on the Arabian coast any time soon.It is further reported in the letter, that the company's agent at Sharga [Sharjah] has been subjected to disrespect from the local population since the departure of Sooltan bin Sugger; the Resident thinks this situation is most likely to be the result of instructions issued by Sooltan bin Sugger himself.The item has two enclosures:1 - Letter of protection issued by Captain Moorsom on board HMS
                           Ariadneto two chilingas from Rusul Khyma, dated March 1824.2 - Extract of a letter to Sooltan bin Sugger, dated 8 July 1824.It is informing him of the aforementioned batilla captured in Charrack bay; that he is to have the batilla turned over to him, so that he may conduct an investigation then punish the owner and crew for disturbing the peace of the Persian Gulf. It further notifies him that word has been received from the British's Native Agent at Sharga, indicating that he has not received the respect from the local population due to his station. It also explains that the Resident does not believe rumours indicating that he (Sooltan bin Sugger) conspires with the Wahhabi to disrupt the peace of the Persian Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x000006#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
