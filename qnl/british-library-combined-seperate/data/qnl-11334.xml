In the attached covering letter which is forwarded to the Secretary of State for India, William Crawford Walton, the Acting Political Resident for Aden, confirms his support of the points put forward by Jacob and urges for decisive action in the region before another Western power takes action and, in turn, takes responsibility for the area. The documents support the institution of a progressive plan by Britain which will involve the construction of public facilities such as roads, railways, schools and hospitals with a view to encouraging support for, and therefore protection of, the Protectorate.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>First Assistant Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Protectorates</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sailing vessels</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public services</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000255#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
