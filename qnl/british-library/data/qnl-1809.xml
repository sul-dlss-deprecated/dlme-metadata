Please allow us to give you the following brief informations about our business and the purpose of the intended establishment: The firm F.Unduetsch &amp; Co. ,Bremen/Germany with whom we are cooperating is doing business in pearl shells with Bahrein Merchants since abt. 20 years. The said company used to be the main importers of Bahrein Shells for Germany and Germany is considered to be the main market for Persian Gulf Shells. During the last years it has proved very difficult to sell the cheaper grades of shells which are mostly used for the manufacturing of small buttons. The reason is that these buttons are 'X being imported in Germany as well as in other European countries from outside, specially Japan, at prices tne European indusitiy of buttons cannot compete with. As,however from the lower grade shells large lots used to be shipped from this side the whole trade in Persian Gulf Shells is badly affected and suffering from selling difficulties. Our company has since long arrived to the convinction that an improvement of the business can be reached only by better selections and assortments of the shells overhere. Better prices and better sales would be possible then and at the same time our shippers here would be able to 2f. unduetsch &amp; co. (iraqi ltd. Baghdad Th e Political Agent, Bahrein PAGE © 2 y' meet more successfully the competition on the German market of shells coming from other regions ,f*i. Venezuela, La Paz, Panama, Massaua * Our continued endeavours to induce our shippers to keep their consignments on a higher standard have so far not leaded to satisfactory results. V/e therefore consider it necessary to be in permanent personal contact with the Bahrein Shell Shippers to give them assistance and advice and to superviese their work at the spot here&lt;&gt; So it is our desire to keep a permanent office in Bahrein for the said purpose. The office to be a branch or subagency of Messrs. F.Unduetsch &amp; Co.(iraq)Ltd.,Baghdad, which is a private limited Company of Iraq, under German Management and cooperating with F.Unduetsch &amp; Co.,Bremeno The main business of the Bahrein Branch would be : to work as Agents of F.Unduetsch &amp; Co.,Bremen in the business of pearl shells, to cooperate with their shippers in Bahrein and to improve generally the export of shells from this side . At the same time the Bahrein firm to be established would carry on the import of general merchandise which was so far done by the above named two companies in Baghdad and Bremen through direct communication with their customers or by their travelling representatives. Their main lines of import business in Bahrein are: Hurricane Lanterns, Household Articles, Typewriters, Radios,Sewing Machines, Photo Cameras &amp; Films,Optical Goods, Pharmaceutical Goods, Building Material such as Water Pipes, Fittings, Iron Bars We hope that these short informations might explain the purpose of the branch we wish to establish in Bahrein. Please be so kind as to give your attention 3F. UNDUETSCH &amp; Co. (IRAQ* Ltd. BAGHDAD Th.6 Political &gt; B PACE to this matter as well as your recommendation to the authority concerned.

Dear Sir, I write to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th December 1938, informing me of your Firm’s desire to establish a branch in Bahrain. 2. I am consulting the necessary authorities and v/ill communicaLe with you further in due course. I I Yours faithfully, /v Political Agent, Bahrain© Secret No. C/762 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 13th December 1933. To \m The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. subjectt- German Trade Activities in the Persian Gulf. Memorandum I l T enclose herewith a copy of a letter wnich I have received from Herr Wattenberg, a member of the Iraq Subsi diary of F. Unduetsch &amp; Co., Bremen. Herr Aattenberg called on me two days ago to inform me that his Company wished to establish a branch in Bahrain, and I requested him to send me a written communication informing me of the scope of the proposed agency. 2. As you are aware there has been a great deal of German interest in this side of the tolf recently, and several German journalists and commercial representatives nave visited Bahrain in the past twelve months. I hear that the Hamburg — Amerika Line are considering reopeni'ig their service to the Gulf and the present communication is further evidence of German deter mination to establish a position in this area. 3. Instinct suggests that as many obstacles as are possi ble should be placed in the way of this venture. German firms may be satisfied with a smaller turn over than those of other nationalities but it is a little surprising that they should consider it worth while to establish a branch in Bahrain solely from the commercial point of view. I gather that the Im m 0 total value of exports of shell to Germany ranges about £ 4000 annually and of Unduetsch* s ’’main lines of import business in Bahrain” typewriters, radios, sewing machines and optical goods represent to them a nicroscopic business. One cannot help wondering therefore Whether the wish to establish a branch in Bahrain has a solely commercial origin. 4. This is presumably a matter on which the views of His Highness should be obtained. But before approaching His Highness I would like to have instructions as to the line 1 myself am to take, for one may assume that --is --ighness will be guided entirely by our advice. I have no doubt that he could, if it is thought desirable, be induced to say that he is not anxious to see any more foreign nationalities represented in Bahrain and that if Unduetsch wish to establish a branch here they must appoint either a iritish or a Bahrain subject as their agent. 5. I am acknowledging the receipt of Herr ^/attenberg* s letter and stating that I will communicate with him further in due course.

As you have stated in your memorandum No. 148-3 dated the 8th i/arch 1939, there are indi cations of Increasing German propaganda against us and there can, I think, be little doubt that the Baghdad broadcasts of anti-British, anti-Kuwait and (to a small extent) anti-Bahrain propaganda were inspired by the German Legation* 3* I can, if you so desire, very easily arrange for His Highness the Shaikh to object to a visit by any German Attache, and I can certainly arrangers indicated in the third para graph of my telegram to the Ambassador, Baghdad, that no accommodation should be available. 4/- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trencha’d Fowle, K.C.T.S., C.B.E., Political Resident in, the Persian Gulf f Buehire.4# If on the other hand higher authorities think that obstruction of this sort is undesirable then in viev of possible anti-Gennan feeling in Bahrain I think I should have to make special arrangements for the f, protection ,, of Kasgall if he came here* &gt; 5.

There is nothing very definite in all this, but it certainly does no good. He is being told that the room he has hitherto had in the Bahrain lest House is now required and this may induce V him to leave. If he goes and lives somewhere else in Manama I think I should try to harry him a little without going to the ext nt of actually ordering him to leave Bahrain* Unfortunately his single journey visa for Bahrain is not limited and I suggestthat in future any visas that may be granted to Germane should be limited to 14 days* Yours sincerely f9/15 Telegram '3' From India Office, London.

He Is ostensibly a business man to whom time ought to be money, yet In spite of this and even after he has been informed that the Agency for the Hamburg-Amerika must be held by either a Bahraini or a Britisher (vide your telegram No.lS, dated the 19th February 1939) he still continues staying on at Bahrain ^studying market conditions 11 . He has been in Bahrain four months and must have completed his studies long ago. 3. I do not regard the small amount of propaganda he can carry on (vide paragraph 6 of your letter) as serious. But what he can do under the cloak of commercial contacts is to build up an espionage and sabotage system. (It is often done ^ in this way.) 4. The Bahrain Government presumably know, or should know, what Individuals visit him; of these probably some are known to be likely subjects for espionage etc. activities. If it has not already been done, I suggest that such individuals might be interrogated and induced either by monetary or other means to say whether Wattenberg has made them any such suggestions. / 5. H. Weightman Esquire, l.c.S., Political Agent, Bahrain.5. Would it also be possible for you to tap bis correspondence through the post office ? 6.
