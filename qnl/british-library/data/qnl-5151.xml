Whilst in Bahrain Mr. Ohba stayed with an Iranian merchant, Mr. Muhammad Tayib Khunji, who has a son in Japan studying business. Mr. Ohba at first wished to arrange for Mr. Muhammad Tayib Khunji to take up his line’s shipping agency, but the request was refused by the Bahrain Government as the firm had no experience of such work.

Dear Sir Cecil, I duly received your letter of the 24th ultimo and must apologise for the delay in replying to it, due to enquiries being made as to the trade in tea done by India with the Bahrein market. These enquiries have resulted in the enclosed statement of exports of tea from India to Bahrein, from which you will see that during the depression in the Indian tea trade when prices were very low, that is from 1928 to 1932, considerable quantities of tea were taken by Bahrein. Since regulation was established, however, and export prices improved in consequence the demana has fallen off very considerably, and I am afraid this market must be regarded as one which it is only possible to retain cn a basis of very cheap prices at much below the cost of production in India. It is in markets of this kind that Chinese and Japanese supplies are likely to prove attractive as these alone are available at sufficiently low prices. It is not surprising, therefore, to learn that Japanese tea is being imported into Bahrein by r way of experiment and if the consumer likes the tea I am afraid he will go on taking it as it is not possible, unless we can bring China and Japan into the regulation scheme, to do anything to stop supplies of this kind, as it would not pay India to attempt to compete with the price quoted for Japanese tea; in fact it v/as because India could not go Sir Cecil E. Kisch, K.C.I.S., C.B., on/ India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l*2 . on taking these low prices that the regulation scheme Vv&amp;s established. Although we have obtained a certain amount ox co-operation from the Chinese we have so far railed to secure any support from the Japanese in connection with the regulation scheme, and I am ax raid tne present political atmosphere which surrounds Japan does not encourage any hope that support may ultimately be forthcoming. There is one aspect of this matter which has to De borne in mind and that is that India, and Ceylon tea has been pushing China and Japan tea out of other markets 'which are remunerative from our point of view, and if we can retain these and, as we hope, add to them we can well afford to let China and Japan have some of the crumbs. I imagine that the consignment of tea the subject of your letter is the produce of Japan, or it may be Formosa. I don't think it comes from Manchuria as there is no record that tea is grown there. It might be China tea imported into Manchuria and exported from there, but this is hardly likely. The India Trade Commissioner has, I see, addressed the International Tea Market Expansion Board on this subject and they in their turn have referred the matter to the International Tea Committee who will, I expect, reply much on the lines of this letter. I am afraid you may not regard this as a very satisfactory reply to your advices but I know you will appreciate the position, and I can assure you that we are very grateful for your continued interest and your present advices on this subject. Yours sincerely, (Sd) R. G-raham.India Office, Wh.itehs,l 1, S.iKl. 13th February, 1936. Dear Graham, Many thanks for your letter or the I3tn February about the Bahrein tea mattei• Since I 'wrote to you I have heard that India had communicated with the Tea Association in India on the subject.

Y SENT BY AIR MAlt. 1 £&gt;' .« India Office, Whitehall, hh &amp; 0. 425/36. 24th January, 1936. fear Sir Robert, I have recently seen correspondence from which it appears that Japanese suppliers are by way of entering the Bahrein market in the toa trade. We are told that a local importer has recently ordered a trial consignment of three hundred cases of so-called Japanese tea for direct shipment in December at a price of 5 annas 6 pies per round c.i.f. Bahrein against the 9 annas 6 pies for Indian tea. The tea is believed to be grown in Manchuria. fne incident is oi some importance to the restriction countries in general and to Indian producers in particular since it amounts to a threat to oust Indian tea from the local market, at least among the poorer classes of consumers. It may be that the Government of India have already called the attention of the I.T.A. to the matter and it is not proposed to taka any offici 1 action here in regard to it but I thought it w rth bringing to your notice in case you or your Committee should think it ■oossible or desirable to do something about it. I em of course aware of the efforts made by the I.T.A. to secure Japanese cooperation and this incident supports the case for ; ressing on with any practicable proposals. Tours sincerely, (Sgd.) C.

The ralue of the Japanese import trade into Iraq, which was hardly worth computing before about 1930, has increased to 6*82^ of the total import trade in 1933. Both in the case, of the United Kingdom and of India, it is their trade in cotton piece goods which is principally affected by Japanese competition, and the value of Japanese imports of cotton piece goods shipped direct from Japan to Iraq increased from less than Ufa of the total tradein 1929-30 to over 29J&amp; in the first six months of 1933-34, The quantity of Indian imports of * 'Unbleached Greys' decreased as the result of Japanese competition from over 15 million yards in 1931-32 to 4-J- million in the first six months of 1933-34, and the percentage of the total trade from 85^ to 52^o, but the statistics given classify**- as Indian imports, Japanese goods reaching Iraq via India, and Sir Francis Humphries considers that Indian trade has probably suffered to a greater extent than shown by the figures, {/ V The intensification of Japanese trade with Iraq will no doubt lead to an increase also in their trade with the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Gulf, In this connection please see the Minute on P.Z, 1469/34, The Japanese concern*!, Mitsubishi Enterprises, have recently offered their trade agency at Bahrein to a reputable Bahreini merchant (Mr. Yusuf Kanoo), and since it has already been decided that it is impracticable to attempt to exclude Japanese trade from Bahrein by political action, the Resident has been informed that there is no objection to Mr. Kanoo accepting the Japanese Agency (P.Z. 3368/34, P.Z. 3671/34).

It 7111 be convenient to consider seriatim the different manufacturee in this category of imports and the effect on the United Kingdom trade therein of Japanese competition* U nblc- ched greys have never been Imported to any extent Iron the United Kingdom* fhe principal sufferer from Jax^anese competition la India, probably to t' greater extent then is snown by the figures, which classify as Indian imports Japanese goods reaching Iraq via India, Tnis consideration applies in the case of all etstisties cf cotton piece goods imports frota Indie • the United Kingdom trade In bleached whites has decreased very considerably, from 74# to 58# in the porlod undor review, the decrease being due almost entirely to Increased Japanese imports. Cotton goods dyed in the piece * the United Kingdom has maintained its position fairly satisfactorily, despite Increased Japanese imports* Cotton/Cotton roods dyed In tho yam are not of great importance as an article of import frem the United Kln^doin* Statistics show a considerable advance of Jcpt-nese imports, but this is probably accounted for largely by the increase of direct shipments from Japan, and tho consequent diminution of the volume of Japanese goods entering Iraq from India, Syria and . b ~gypt. Japanese sports are on the Increase, and i^.portG fra*; the United Kingdom have fallen from 67/S to 40/S uuring the period under review* United Kingdom imports of other kinds of cotton piece-goods, ^hlcfc Include the more expensive manu factures, have, ye was to be expected, maintained th^lr position, and have avan made some gain, on a value percentage basis, at the expense of Kuropean competitors, Japanese Imports have increased slightly. 8. taking the cotton piece goods imports as a wools, the United kingdom sh»r© of the trade, on a value bs.sis, decreased from 42 per cent in 1931/32 to 37 per ce *t in 1932/1033 and to 36 per cent in the gIt months ended on September 30 1933. tfhile Japanese imports increased from 17/b in 1932/33 to 30/ in the first half of tho year 1933/34. Again, however, it if.uu t be bo .me in iriim th^t these percentages are calculated on direct shipments from Japan. If arrivals oi JaponevC textiles from India are taken into account, the real percentage of Japanese imports for these two periods are;- 42 per cent 51 ' ' 1st heIf of 1932/33 1933/1954Tae fall In the United Kingdom 1 e Aare of the trade, of 5;* in the year 1932/33, and of a farther IJi In the first half of the year 1933/1934, may safely bo attributed to Japanese competition, 9. Turnlnr to the other Imports of Japanese origin, rhich * ro of much less value than that country*s imports of cotton piece goods, it will be seen from enclosure 2 in this cesp tch that United Kingdom trade h:-s suffered from Japanese competition to rome, but not to a very serious extent, in artificial silk piece ad other goods, In silk goods of* all kinds, and in boots and Lhoes. Japan*s gains have been rstie pri-.nrlly at the erpense, as regards silk and artificial silk, of Italy, Syria and france. In oth-r clussos of imported goods in which Japan has a share the Uniioa Aingdom has generally maintained, and in eerne cases improved her position. In such co-.r.odities as sugar, metals and ores, machinery, vehicles, provisions fmd liquor, which rank in impor tance immcdl! toly after cotton goods in the Hot of United Kingdom Imports, Japanese competition is practically non-eriatent. 10, i'ho adverse effect of Japanese competition on the United Kingdom trade in cotton piece goods and other ccnr.oditlec must naturally ertend to other iSrlcisu interest such as shipping, on sccount of the loss of freights involved ( the extent of which can beet be ascertained in London from shipping r siilfosts ), end insurance, British banking, does act cuffor, since payment for Japanese goods importedinto Iraq, is aade either hy sterling bills or by yen credits settled through London. Further, some set off to the loss of freights from the United Kingdom is provided by the carriage in British bottoms of Japanese goods, but the continuance of this on the same scale as hitherto is by no means assured, and may disappear altogether as a result of an extension of direct sailings by Japanese vessels between Japanese ports and Basrah. 11. The commercial interests of other countries have not been prejudiced by the increase of activity of Japanese importers except as indicated in the preceding paragraph. No representations have, so far as I am aware been made on their behalf to the Iraq Government. 12. There can be no doubt that the Iraq Govern ment is fully alive to the fact of the rapid increase of Japanese imports into this country { and I have lost no opportunity of directing their attention to the potential dangers of this situation. The responsible advisers of the Government, however* for reasons set forth in my despatches No. 201 of March o9th and 304 of May 18th, 1933, are not unduly concerned at that increase 'per se”, but would welcome an increase of Iraqi Exports to Japan, at present non-existent for all practical purposes, as a set-off to the growing volume of Japanese imports into Iraq. No formal negotiations to this end have as yet taken place, but in the course of last the Iraqi Minister in London was instructed to//“N to draw the attention of the «Tapanepe Mnhafisador to the unfavourable trade balance with a view to inducing Japan to inport da tee and wheat from Iraq; and the Iraq Government have given their attention to the matter of providing other return cargoes for the Japanese tramp vessels which are now calling at Basra at Intervals of two months* Thus it is proposed to make available at Pao a quantity of 35,000 tons of salt annually, which could be taken by those vessels in place of the shipments of Persian cotton which have hitherto furnished their return freights a 13° The limitation of Japanese imports into Iraq, should they be found to constitute a danger to the economic structure of the country, is of course primarily the concern of the Iraqi Government, hut any steps that they might take to that end might well result in limitation of British imports also* The vdvisers of the Tran Government are not at oresent convinced that the growth of Japanese imports is prejudicial to Iraq interests, since the Customs revenue does not suffer thereby and since same benefit. In the shape of lower prices, ip derived therefrom by the population of the country® The Government would, however, welcome an increased export of Iraqi produce to Japan* If this cannot be secured by means of an informal 'gentleman’s' agreement there are several vayn in which Iraq could exert the necessary pressure* 14* \ system of quota imports might be introduced, in which case, if the quota were based on the figures for, say, the past four years, a substantial reduction of Japanese imports would be obtained* Such a system is/16*/ *r Is however* Introduced primarily to protect the industries of the country imposing it* and could not he justified on that ground in the case of Iraq 0 15. Clearing agreements might he concluded between Iraq, ^following the example of Turkey,) and her chief eupnliers, providing for an adjustment of trade balances^ In that case, from the point of view of United Kingdom interests, much would depend on the method of adjustment Imports from the United Kingdom to Iraq and exports from Iraq to the United Kingdom are approximately equal in terms of percentages of the total import and export trade of this country, but in actual value imports from the United Kingdom exceed exports from Iraq to the United Kingdom by over one million pounds aanuallyo On the basis of percentages of value only the United f!tates of A.merica is more favourably situated than the United Kingdom, and the effect of a clearing agreement concluded on that basis between Japan and Iran would result in an increased export of Iraqi produce to .Japan and a consequent addition to the purchasing power of Iraq, which should in turn prove of benefit to United Kingdom importers by increasing ohe demand in the Iraqi market for the better class and more expensive goods of which they are the main producers* Puch clearing agreements may obviously be open to objection on other grounds*AN ► a18„/ 16* article 6 of the Cuptome Tariff Law of 19SS provided that Iraa wiy impope additional duties on /*oodP oriRinatlng in a country which suh^rctn Iraqi exports to excessive duties, or the currency of which is depreciated to a point when it tends to disturb normal trade competition,, Iraq recovers her freedom of action in fiscal matters i^ regard to , T apan in 1955 by reason of the latter’s withdrawal from the League of Hattons* There is, however, no evidence that Iraqi imports are dutied at an excessive rate in Japan, and it would probably be difficult to show that depreciation of the Yen has occasioned dislocation of normal trade* The encouragement to overtrade provided by the constant cutting of prices of Japanese goods might he held to provide an excuse for action under the article quoted, but the advisers of the Iraq Government are of the opinion that the elimination -&gt;f this potential danger can safely be left to the good sense of the trading community* 17* On the whole I am of the opinion that discriminatory action against Japanese imports is unlikely to be taken by the Iraqi Government In the near future, since Japanese interests are undoubtedly endeavouring to find some commodity exportable from Iraq to Japan, if only to serve as return freight from Basrah when no Persian cotton or other cargo Is available at18* It may not be out of place to refer here to my despatch KOo754 of November 29, 1933 (196/25/33) In -which *ere eet forth proposals for the reduction of the United Kingdom duty on certain Iraq products in return for an adjustment of the Iraqi tariff in regard to motor vehicles and those textiles which are of particular interest to United Kingdom manu- facturerso I understand that the Board of Trade are still studying those proposals, the negotiations in regard to which might provide a suitable opportunity of exerting pressure on the Iraqi Governrent in their attitude towards Japanese trade with Iraq in general 0 ‘JQ* I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Denartmcnt of Overseas Trade? etCo, (ngd) 'P’pHo Kumphrys I have.(P.Z. 3278/54.)

Japanese Competition in Foreign Markets, Sir, YOU will be aware of the attention which, for some considerable time past, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have been devoting to the question of Japanese competition with British trade in various parts of the world. His Majesty’s Representatives and consular officers in the countries principally affected have supplied a considerable amount of useful information on the subject, and a large quantity of statistics and other material derived from official reports is in the possession of the Foreign Office and of the other Departments interested. 2. There are, however, certain aspects of the question on which information is still required, and the following are suggested as indicating the lines along which further investigation might be made in so far as this has not already been done:— (a) the extent to which staple imports from Japan have increased during the last two years and the extent to which new lines of imports from Japan are developing, illustrated, but only when recent and reliable statistics exist, by extracts from the trade returns of the country in which you reside; (5) the more important United Kingdom interests affected, or likely to he affected; (c) the extent to which the commercial interests of other countries have been prejudiced and the steps, if any, taken by the Governments of such countries with the Government to which you are accredited; His Majesty’s Representative [p.t.o. at (023/1934) 7318 9743-u{d) the action, if any, taken by the Government to which yon are accredited; if action has been taken, its precise nature should be explained, particularly if it involves in any way a change of treaty relationship or a discrimination against Japanese goods; (e) political or social considerations which may deter the Government to which you are accredited from taking action mentioned above, such as general relations with Japan, desirability of not depriving native populations of a source of cheap supply, dependence on exports to Japan, reliance on Japanese imports for an important part of their Customs revenue. 3.

Ko. 15 of the S3rd October, I hare the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a letter addressed to ae by 4r. Hurst regarding the recent call of a Japanese vessel at Basrah. Several Japanese officials and business ^en have visited Iraq in the past twelve aionths In connection with their rapidly expanding export trade to this country. They have discussed the possibilities of export of Iraqi produce to Japan, such as dates and wheat and even (see 4y despatch O.T. Ko.(B) 38 of 31st January) Arab horses, in order presu^bly to allay Iraqi criticise of the lack of equilibrium in the trade balance between the two countries; and have talked freely of running a line of Japanese steaaers via India to Basrah. So far nothing appears to have come of these discussions since the only cargo the Japanese have loaded at Basrah is scrap- iron. 2. I have sent a copy of this despatch to the Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Co^oercial Secretary in Tehran and (without enclosure) to His Majesty's Consul, at Basrah under Ho.90 of date.

Its low price (32s/- per ton, c.i.f.

It is reported that they have opened offices in Persia under the name of Persian trading Company with their head office at Tehran, 3 . Two interesting visitors who paid visits to Basra were Messrs. K.G.Unno and H.K&amp;watoata. The former, who also visited Persia, came to Basra to study shipping, with the object, if possible of running a Japanese line of steamers from Japan to Basra via India, but did not find the outlook very encouraging. He collected shipping data from all possible sources, and especially from Messrs. F.C.Stride &amp; Co., Basra, whose principals in London are the agents of Yaraashita Steamship Company,Limited, of Kobe. It is of interest to note that two Japanese steamers (1) Seiun Mara (2) Joyoshida Maru visited the Persian Gulf Ports during the course of this year, and that the Captain of one of these stenmers was Mr. M.G.ITnno, referred to above. 4. The Basra agents of these steamers were Messrs. ?#C. Striok &amp; Co.,(Basra) Limited, Basra. The second visitor, Mr. H. Kawabata, is reported to have visited these parts with the object of purchasing cotton. He stated himself, to a person who interviewed him, that he was not inclined to purchase anything from Iraq, at least for the time being. It is, however, reported that 53,000 bales of cotton were purchased from Persia by the Japanese and that 30,000 of these have already been exported from Kohammerah.
