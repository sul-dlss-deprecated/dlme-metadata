A telegram has been received from the India Office to the effect that the matron of the Bahrain Government Hospital wishes to recruit three British nursing sisters and has approached the Overseas Nursing Association. The India Office state that in view of the extreme shortage and the difficulty b? releasing nurses for India they will be glad to have the Political Agentf-s views on the necessity for three nurses for Bahrain. 2. If the Bahrain Government do desire to recruit three British nurses will you please provide me with reasons which would in your opinion justify an approach being made to the Ministry of Labour for their release? Political Agent, BahrainConfidential. No. tOg- 'O of 1363 Office of the Adviser to the Government , Bahrain Dated, Moharram 16, 1363 January 12, 1944. Reference your memorandum No. C/45 dated 7th January 1944. When the question of starting a Nursing Home in Bahrain in conjunction with the Government Hospital was under consideration the Matron of the Government Hospital made tentative enquiries from various sources in India and from the Overseas Nursing Association about the possibility of obtaining Nursing Sisters to work in Bahrain. The position has now changed. Owing to difficulties in obtaining staff and the high cost of building it is not possible at present to proceed with the scheme for a Nursing Home. The Matron of the Government Hospital is going on long leave in the spring and the staff sister, Miss Rodriquez, is returning to India at the same time on completion of her term of service. A British Nursing Sister, to act as Matron during the absence of Miss Safbottle is most urgently required and in addition we are considering employing a British Nursing Sister in place of Miss Rodriquez. There is just a possibility of being able to find someone now in Bahrain who might act as Matron during Miss Harbottle T s absence on leave. I will let you know whether this is possible within a day or two. It was not our intention to obtain Nursing Sisters from the United Kingdom but from India, it appears however from your letter that the United Kingdom is supplying India with Nurses so there would seem to be small likelihood of any Nurses being obtainable direct from India.

I hoped to find some one here vdio could help us in the emergency but my efforts in that direction have failed. For some months we have been trying to find nurses in India, South Africa and the Middle East but without success. Our advertisements and enquiries produced no satisfactory results. This is the present position. The Matron, Miss Harbottle, is goin-g on leave in the spring after four years work and it is essen tial that she should take leave. The Assistant Matron, Miss Rodriguez, is return ing to India in March, on completion of contract, and does not wish to stay on here. Some one to act as matron is essential and a staff sister is also needed, both British. The matron is responsible for the interior admi nistration of the men f s, women f s and isolation hospi tals, also for the service wards. There are about 150 beds in the three hospitals, usually full, and in addition there are 26 beds in the service v/ards which owing to probable R.A.F. expansion etc. are likely to be full. The matron trains the local staff, makes all arrangements for feeding and is in charge of a quantity of valuable stores. The staff sister is , TT- 2 - is also theatre sister. The four R.A.F. nurses v/ho work in the service wards do nothing except the actual nursing and do no theatre work. The original complement of Indian nursing staff for the hospital was 6 female nurses, 3 midwives, 8 male nurses, not including local staff. We are having difficulty in retaining the Indian staff as - although their pay has been raised they can get well paid jobs in India and they prefer to serve in their own country. In the near future our Indian staff is likely to be reduced to 2 female nurses and 3 male nurses. Local Arabs, trained by the matron, are shaping out well but it will be still some time before they are capable of working without a great deal of supervision which at present it is not possible to give them as the matron is fully occupied with administration and routine work. I have had a discussion with the doctors and the matron on the question of staff. We agreed that it would eventually be possible to train local men and women to do the work which has in the past been done by Indian nurses. One local Arab girl who was trained in the nursing school at Baghdad and obtained certi ficates there has turned out very successfully. With three British nursing sisters one working as staff sister in the men’s hospital, one as staff sister in the women’s hospital and one as theatre sister and eight Indian male and female nurses it would be possible to run the hospitals more effectively and at no less cost than with the full Indian staff which was origi nally contemplated.w &lt;© i H {=q fQ - • . -P c!

Our most urgent need is one British nursing sister, as soon as possible, to do the work of the matron while she is on leave. We should also like to obtain one or two nursing sisters, one of them will take the place of Miss Rodriguez the present staff sister. I think the following arguments could be put forward, based mainly on the war work vfhich is undertaken by the hospital, I feel that it is only on these grounds that nursing sisters might be released. Two wards of 26 beds and two private rooms are used by service patients. Though four R.A.B. sisters have been lent, they only nurse. They do no theatre duties. The matron and staff sister are responsible for administration, dieting and theatre work and for providing and training the local staff, which when the wards are full amounts to 12 persons including dressers, probationers and bearers, who work in the service wards. The matron is going on leave after four years service and the staff sister is leaving. It is therefore essential, apart from the needs of the civil part of the hospital, to obtain two nursing sis ters with a possibility of a third sister later on and of these two one nursing sister is required as soon as possible. It is possible that the R.A.F. might offer to sup ply a matron from their suaff in Iraq. I do not think this would be a very desirable solution, I think the person acting as matron should be an employee of the p 1,Telegram From To No. 91. Dated the 4 /% S.

I have the following suggestions and observations to make:- (2). I think that it is possible that the Nursing Sisters will ask for their salary to commence on the day of their appointment to Bahrain Government service. In these days of transport delays it would be reasonable to consider recompensing the Sisters for unforeseen expenditure due to circumstances over which they had no control such as spending a month in Capetown waiting for a ship. (6) . I suggest that all should be excluded after the first (.) and that there should be a separate paragraph for •Furlough' which should run as follows:- % 6 (a) • Fur lough. months furlough would be earned for each year of service in addition to the annual- leave but may not be enjoyed until two years' service been completed. Both leave and furlough may be accumulated and enjoyed at any time after the completion of two years' service. Furlough will not count against the term of contract as active service. (7) . Add : If annual leave and furlough is accumulated the cost of passages which would have been payable had the leave or furlough been enjoyed at the time they became due may be accumulated and paid at the time leave or furlough is actually enjoyed. (10)y I would prefer the following Absence from duty up to 15 days annually on medical certificate due to minor ailments will not count against earned leave. Special sick leave up to 4 weeks on full pay and 8 weeks on half pay may be granted on medical certificate to cover serious illness during the period of contract. This sick leave will not be deducted from annual leave and or furlough. The employee has the right to appear before a Medical Board should any question of her health arise and the Bahrain Government have the right to require her to do so in like circumstances. Yours sincerely, Balrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain. to your D.0.No.536-10 dated the 21st iEXT,1161/44 INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W.X Madam, In reply to your letter of the 29 th February, I am directed to inform you that the Political Authorities in the Persian G-ulf have been consulted with regard to the points raised therein in connection with the recruitment of three Nursing Sisters for the Bahrein Government Hospital, and have supplied the following information, (1) The net salaries offered by the Bahrein Government are 100% higher than those of the R,A.F, Sisters employed in the same Hospitals. The messing expenses which would have to be met out of these salaries would probably amount to about Rs. 80 to Rs,100 per mensem (i*e. £72 to £90 per annum)# ( 2 ) The Bahrein Government is prepared to contribute to the Federated Superannuation Scheme for Nurses so that Nurses who are members may keep their policies intact, and also topay the cost of a return passage to this Country should employment be terminated after the probationary period, ( 3 ) The outfit allowance offered by the Bahrein Government is £30 on joining and £13 per annum afterwards. The Overseas Nursing Association is authorised to make advances for the purchase of uniforms and tropical outfits in this Country, ( 4 ) The Bahrein Government are sending your Association forms of agreement to be signed by the Sisters. If however their departure would be delayed by the non-arrival of these forms the Bahrein Government are willing for your Association to draw them up. I am, Madam, four obedient Servant The Secretary, Overseas Nursing Association, Imperial Institute, South Kensington, S.W.7. ■ ■■■ PfliPPP'lf ■P»aan— - -. — —. - —, —' 8M. R. 74/740. 1 July, 1940. The Federated Superannuation Scheme for Nurses and Hospital Officers (Contributory). (Incorporated under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1917). Temporary War-time Address :—' Greenacre,” Sutton Lane, Banstead, Surrey. NOTES ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE SCHEME. The Scheme was brought into operation on the Isz! January, 1928, and at the date of this issue has been adopted by In-patient Institutions representing 85% of the total voluntary bed complement of Great Britain, and also by over 850 Nursing Associations and many other Nursing, Charitable and other “ Institutions ” without in-patient Beds, including British managed Institutions abroad. The following notes are prepared for the convenience of Members and Participating Institutions, to give them in short and simple language certain provisions of the Scheme, “ Pensions 31.”f It should, however, be clearly understood that any questions affecting the legal interpretation of the Scheme are solely governed by “ Pensions 31.” % 1. GENERAL. The Scheme is a contributory one providing Superannuation and other benehts commensurate with the career of each individual Member. Its provisions ensure free migration within *Nursing and *Hospital Service at home or abroad without loss of benefit, and cover every possible circumstance which may arise during each Member’s career. The Scheme is under the Administration, Management and Control of the Central Council operating through an elected Executive. In the case of a Member employed by a Participating Institution, contributions are payable as to two-thirds by the Institution and as to one-third by the Member. These contributions are applied as premiums on an Insurance Policy effected in the name of the Central Council, as Grantee and Trustee for the Member and the Participating Institution. Increment Policies, securing additional benefits, are effected at successive stages in the Member’s career. Provision may also be made for “ back service ” (i.e., service prior to the adoption of the Scheme by the Institution). The quotations furnished by the panel of Life Offices have been approved and accepted by the Central Council for the purpose of the Scheme, and the Member may select the Life Office with which the policy is to be effected. Uniformity of policy conditions has been secured. No commission is payable to anyone, and the whole of the contributions are used to obtain the maximum benefit for each Member. The rate of contributions (see Page 2) depends only on the rank and/or salary, and is not affected by the age of the Member. The benefits payable on retirement depend on the age at entry, the period of contributory service, the rank and salary attained, the amount of contributions paid, and the class of policy and Life Office selected. 2. MEMBERSHIP. \(See Clauses 17-26). (i) Subject to certain options and exemptions, the more important of which are summarised in paragraph (ii) below, membership of the Scheme is COMPULSORY in the following circumstances in the case of the following persons who are engaged by a Participating Institution after its adoption of the Scheme and forms one of the terms of their employment. (a) Every male and female Officer, as defined in the Scheme : if he/she is or as soon as he/she becomes a Senior Officer as defined in the Scheme, i.e., one whose Remuneration is £160 per annum or more and who is engaged on the Administrative, Clerical, Dispensing, Massage or other salaried staff (except Medical, Nursing or Domestic Staff or Manual Workers). (b) Every female Trained Nurse, as defined in the Scheme : forthwith after the date of engagement. (c) Every Probationer, as defined in the Scheme : if and when membership is compulsory under the regulations of the Participating Institution. (Every Participating Institution on its adoption of the Scheme makes a regulation as to whether probationers are to be admitted to the Scheme and, if so, whether they are to be admitted at the commencement of the 2nd, 3rd or 4th year of training, or whether admission is to be deferred until the completion of training). (ii) Membership is OPTIONAL in the case of the following persons :— (a) All eligible male and female employees as defined in the Scheme, on the Staff of a Participating Institution when it adopts the Scheme (Membership is compulsory if and when a Junior Officer on the Staff at the time of the adoption of the Scheme later becomes a Senior Officer ; see (c) below). (b) Any Probationer, after the completion of her first year of training and until membership becomes compulsory. (c) Any male or female Junior Officer (i.e., an Officer in receipt of ^remuneration of not less than £100 per annum but less than £160 per annum) on the staff of a Participating Institution when it adopts the Scheme or who joins its staff after its adoption of the Scheme, until he/she becomes a Senior Officer (see (a) above), when membership becomes compulsory. *See Paragraph 11 herein. ■j-NOTE.—All clauses quoted are those in the Scheme,' Pensions 31,” obtainable from the printers to the Scheme, Messrs. W. &amp; J. Rounce, Ltd., 18-20, Appold Street, E.C. 2, price 1/4.{d) Any Male Trained Nurse as defined in the Scheme. (e) Any Male or Female Assistant Nurse, including a Midwife or Village Nurse, who is employed by a Participating Institution. (/) Any District Nurse who is a Queen’s Nurse and a member of the Long Service Fund of the Queen’s Institute of District Nursing if, on account of her age when she would, but for this proviso, be bound to become a Member, she would benefit more by remaining in that Fund than by becoming a Member. (g) Any eligible male or female person employed by a Participating Institution who is a foreign subject, or who, although a British subject, is ordinarily resident outside the British Isles. (A) Any eligible male or female person who is superannuable under the provisions of any statute (e.g., a midwife engaged under the Midwives Act, 1936, to whom the Local Government Superannuation Act, 1937, is applicable). (i) Any Senior Officer or Trained Nurse who is employed by two or more Institutions. (iii) A temporary employee of an Institution may NOT become a member. Employment for any period not exceeding six months may be regarded as temporary employment if the Participating Institution and the employee so agree. (iv) The maximum ages for New Entrants are Men 59 next birthday ; Women 54 next birthday ; but any New Entrant who has reached either of the above respective ages at the commencement of * membership and is in the employment of a Participating Institution when it adopts the Scheme may become a Member with the permission of the Participating Institution and the Council. 3. CONTRIBUTIONS. (i) All contributions in respect of employees of Participating Institutions are payable as to two-thirds by the Participating Institution and as to one-third by the Member and are continued throughout the period of employment, irrespective of age attained. (ii) Rates of Contributions. [a) District Nurses, Candidates in Training, District Midwives and Village Nurses (including both Trained Nurses and Assistant Nurses). (See Clauses 93 to 95) : The Institution may select any one of the under-mentioned rates of contributions. The higher the rate of contributions selected the greater will be the benefits secured to the Member :— A minimum premium of £18 p.a. An alternative premium of £21 p.a. An alternative premium of £24 p.a. An alternative premium, if ^remuneration is £180 p.a. or more, viz. : 15% of the remuneration (provided as to two-thirds (10%) by the Institution and one-third (5%) by the Member). (b) All Other Eligible Employees. (See Clause 3) : The total contribution is 15% of the *remuneration, payable as to two-thirds by Institution and one-third by the Member. (iii) Increased Contributions. (See Clauses 33 and 95). From time to time contributions are increased and additional policies are effected at successive * stages in the individual Member’s career, thus securing additional benefits commensurate with the rank and salary attained. (iv) Back Service Contributions. (See Clauses 43 to 47). If desired, special arrangements can be made to secure additional benefits in respect of the “ back service ” of Members who have already given some years of service prior to their inclusion in the Scheme. Full information may be obtained on application to the Central Office of the Scheme. 4. MIGRATION. (See Clauses 62 to 89 and 102). One of the most important features of the Scheme is that membership is continued until retirement from *Nursing/*Hospital Service. The provisions of the Scheme cover not only migration to another Participating Institution (in which case contributions by and in respect of the Member continue, either compulsorily or optionally) but also periods during which the Member may be unable to provide contributions, or may be able to contribute only at a reduced rate, e.g., on migration within *Nursing or ^Hospital Service at home or abroad but otherwise than to a Participating Institution. In each case of migration otherwise than to a Participating Institution, the Central Office of the Scheme advises the Migrant of the several options available, which may be summarised briefly as under :— (i) To contribute as a Private Member an amount equal to the full premium on the policy. (ii) To contribute as a Private Member a minimum amount equal to one-third of the premium on the current policy (i.e., ordinarily the amount previously deducted from salary). (iii) To suspend temporarily the payment of premiums for some stated period. (iv) To cease payment of premiums. Whichever course is adopted, the interests of the Member and of any Participating Institution concerned are fully protected and full account is ta.ken of all contributions previously paid. In the case of a Deferred Annuity Policy the contributions previously paid and those to be paid, if any, after migration, accumulate at compound interest until retirement from *Nursmg or *Hospital Service. *See Paragraph 11.5. *PENSION AGE. (See Clauses 105 and 129 to 134). The Scheme does not provide for a specific age for retirement. This remains a matter of arrangement between the Institution and the Member, but for the sake of uniformity policies are written to mature as follows :— (i) Men—on the anniversary date of the policy in the 60th year of age. (ii) Women—on the anniversary date of the policy in the 55th year of age. *“ Pension Age ” is the date on which the initial policy matures. If a Member continues in *Hospital/*Nursing Service after any policy has matured, whether before, at, or after Pension Age, contributions are also continued and the benefits secured on retirement are correspondingly increased. 6. FORM OF BENEFIT. The Scheme provides a choice of two forms of benefit :— (i) The Deferred Annuity policy. This is most suitable for single women without dependants since it secures at maturity an annuity or a single cash payment of guaranteed amounts, and provides for the return of all premiums with compound interest in the event of termination of membership or death before the policy maturity date. (ii) An Endowment Assurance. This is more usually selected by a Male Officer or other Member who considers it necessary to make provision for a dependant who might otherwise suffer serious hardship in the event of the premature death of the Member. An Endowment Assurance secures a single cash payment on death before maturity or an annuity at guaranteed rates in lieu of the cash payment at maturity. Unlike the Deferred Annuity Policy the surrender value of an Endowment Assurance in its early years is less than the premiums paid because of the insurance cover given against the risk of death. Any one of three forms of Endowment Assurance may be selected :— (a) “ Without-profits ”—the Sum Assured remains unchanged throughout the duration of the policy. (b) “ With-profits ”—the Sum Assured is increased by the addition of bonuses declared out of the profits of the Life Office. (e) ' With guaranteed bonus ” of £2 per cent, per annum—the Sum Assured increases at a uniform rate each year. Endowment Assurances issued since the outbreak of War on the 3rd September, 1939, are subject to a condition (not applicable to policies issued before the outbreak of War) providing that :— “ If the death of the Life Assured (the Member) shall arise either directly or indirectly from any war “ (whether war be declared or not) the amount payable under this policy shall be limited to a sum being either :— (i) “ the total amount of premiums (exclusive of extra premiums) paid hereunder less any sums “ paid by the Company in respect of bonuses in cash, portions of sum assured or of surrender “ value, or otherwise ; or (ii) “ the surrender value of the policy ; “ whichever shall be the greater, but shall not exceed in any case the sum assured stated herein and attaching “ bonuses, if any.” 7. RETIREMENT. RETIREMENT BEFORE ^PENSION AGE AND WITHIN THE *PRESCRIBED PERIOD. (See Clauses 114-122). In the event of retirement within a prescribed period (the periods are five to ten years from the date of admission to membership according to the class of Member), the Member’s policies are at his/her option either surrendered or assigned to him/her. If the policies are surrendered the *Benefit of the member’s contributions are fpaid to him and the *Benefit of the Institution’s contributions are jpaid to the Participating Institutions concerned. If the member’s policies are assigned to him the member fpays to each Participating Institution concerned an amount equal to the Benefit of its contributions or if unable to make this payment the policies are adjusted before assignment so that in either case the Participating Institution freceives ^the Benefit of its contributions. In all cases of assignment, stamp duty is payable by the Member. RETIREMENT BEFORE ^PENSION AGE BUT AFTER THE *PRESCRIBED PERIOD. (See Clauses 123-125). In the event of retirement after the prescribed period one of the following courses are adopted f :— (i) The policies are assigned to the Member. (ii) The policies are assigned upon trust for the application of the policy moneys and the income thereof in or towards the maintenance of the Member and his dependants. (iii) The policies are surrendered and the proceeds are paid to the Member for his absolute use and benefit. (iv) The policies are surrendered and the proceeds are applied in or towards the maintenance of the Member and his dependants. (v) The policies are surrendered and the proceeds are applied in the purchase of an annuity for the Member and his dependants. RETIREMENT AT *PENSION AGE. (See Clauses 126-128). In the event of retirement at Pension Age one of the following courses are adopted :— (i) The annuity secured by any matured policy is applied in or towards the maintenance of the Member and his dependants. (ii) The policy moneys of any matured policies are paid to the Member for his absolute use and benefit, or are applied in the purchase of an annuity for the Member and his dependants or are paid or applied in or towards the maintenance of the Member and his dependants. *See Paragraph 11. fin each case subject to a deduction or charge in respect of the expenses of terminating membership. 34 RETIREMENT AFTER PENSION AGE. (See Clause 135). In the event of a Member continuing in service after Pension Age contributions also are continued until retirement, when correspondingly increased benehts are paid or applied as in cases of retirement at Pension Age. 8. DEATH. (See Clauses 136 and 137). (i) Members other than probationers : The policy moneys (i.e., the surrender value of a Deferred Annuity policy, or the Sum Assured, with bonuses if any, under an Endowment Assurance) are paid to the personal representatives of the deceased Member or are applied in and towards the maintenance of the deceased Member’s dependants. (ii) Probationers : On the death of a probationer the Benefit of the member’s contributions are paid to the personal representatives of the deceased Member and the Benefit of the Institutions contributions are payable to the Institutions concerned. (hi) On the payment of any moneys in respect of a deceased Member whether to the personal representatives of the deceased Member or to the deceased Member s dependants, a deduction is made in respect of expenses. 9. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. The Administrative Expenses of the Scheme are met principally by Annual Subscriptions ^ payable by Participating Institutions and by Entrance Fees payable by individual Members. 10. INCOME TAX. This Scheme is regarded by the Board of Inland Revenue as one to which the proviso to Section 32 (3) (e) of the Income Tax Act, 1918, applies. The contributions made under it by Members, and Private Members consequently rank as life assurance premiums for relief of income tax. 11. DEFINITIONS.

Political ?D.O.No.C/1283 3rd September 194^1 My dear Snow, .. - VijC r-• I as returning Miss Haraottle*s letter after perusal. 2. I notice that you state that sho is entitled to resign on giving three months* notice. The copy of Miss Harhottle’s ' x Tv^ ' contract in my possession shows that she may only resign on giving six months* notice. This contract was, I understand, renewed sometime earlier this year. Can you confirm that the contract has in fact been renewed and that no alter;, tions were made in the lady’s conditions of service. Has Miss Harbottle’s resignation been formally accepted? 3. The Bahrain Government intimated that they required three nursing sisters in order to carry on the work that they were doing for the Services and the civil population and considerablo trouble has been gone 4^to by the India Office, the Overseas Nursing Asso ciation, and ourselves, in order to recruit and obtain the release from service in England of these ladles in the shortest possible time. They were to be additional to the present matron and it was intimated that it would be difficult to carry on the work of the hospital without all three of them. One lady has already arrived, the second was due to sail from the United Kingdom at the end of July, but the third has not so far been selected. In view of the difficulty of obtaining personnel at the present time I do not consider that the Bahrain Government are Justified in permitting Miss Harbottle to leave before she has completed the full period of notice required by her contract. Assuming that her resignation has been or will be accepted the period of notice will presumably run from the date of her letter and will thus terminate on the Sth of January 1945. This will allow ample time, I hope, for the third sister to arrive in Bahrain. fours sincerely, Dr. R.H.3. Snow, State Medical Officer, Bahrain. Copy for information to G.V/.R. Smith hsq. , As.

He therefore communicated with the India Office whose reply is to the effect that the statements are totally unfounded. The nurses were not interviewed at the India Offic«a whose advice to the Overseas Nursing Association was that the nurses should take everything with them. As regards Lsigh they say that they spent their time impressing on him the desirability of taking things from England.

Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with your Memorandum No.1064-10 dated the 18th of May, 1946? 2. ?£iss Adamson came to see me yesterday in con nection with her contract with the Bahrain Government. She told me that in consequence of her engagement she had been given to understand that the Bahrain Govern ment proposed to terminate her services, she wished to know how she stood in the matter and asked my advice. This I was unable to give since in the event of a dispute I should be arbitrator. 3. I told her, however, that I would ask you to expedite whatever decision it is the Bahrain Govern ment intends to make and would ask you to let me have a copy of the communication, j should be grateful if you would do this early. Dear Belgrave Yours sincerely C.D. Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, B a h r a i n.In order to avert any future matrimonial complications among Nursing Sisters employed by the Bahrain Government I think that there should be some suitable clause to cover this eventuality in their Agreements. 2 . I believe I am correct in supposing that it is impossible to lay down in any agreement that the party to it is forbidden to marry, this was decided recently in England in a test case in the courts, i would propose to insert into future agreements something on these lines ’’If the Nursing Sister should marry before the expiration of her agreement with the Bahrain Government she will be deemed to have terminated on her part her agreement with the Government and the Government will not then be liable for the payment of her return passage to U.K. or for any salary in lieu of notice.” 3. This condition is not unreasonable, it means that if a Nursing Sister becomes engaged to be married she must give due notice and be married after the period of notice. 4. I should be grateful for any suggestion on the subject. I have written to Miss Gawan Taylor, Secretary of the overseas Nursing Asso ciation, who I know well, asking her about clauses or conditions of this sort in agreements between other organisations and Nursing Sisters.

The 27th November, 1946. Dear Mr. Belgrave, I am very sorry to hear from your letter of October 26th that Miss Adamson has resigned to be married. It is most unfortunate coming so soon, especially when you say that she was proving a success ful Matron. With regard to your question about other agree ments, I am sending for your information a copy of the stock agreement of the Overseas Nursing Association that was drafted for tne private nursing associatings which recuit nurses through the Association. This is used, with various additions and amendments, by Nursing Homes and private Hospitals. You will see in section 7 that a nurse who resigns before completion of her contract forfeits her return passage, and may be asked to refund the outward passage. According to the usual practice she is asked to regund when rshe hdspnot served half the period. Some Societies have a clause inserted to the effect that marriage automatically terminates the contract although the nurse may be re-appointed on a temporary agreement. In the Colonial Nursing Service, Nursing Sisters are normally required to resign on marriage, but may then be appointed on local agreement. Sisters usually sign a passage agreement with the Grown Agents for the Colonies before they go out undertaking to refund the passage money if they relinquish appointment within a year of date of arrival. Leave in the Colonial Service is in most cases calculated on the basis of a fixed number of days in respect of each completed month of resident service. I I note that you have promoted Miss Maguire to be Matron. I am glad that service has received this recog nition and hope she will do well as Matron. You say that Miss Adamson’s resignation means that you will nedd another sister in addition to'.Miss Millson. Will you need two sisters, as we already understood that there was a vacancy for a sister in the Women’s hospital? We will do our best to find a suitable candidate or candidates. As nurses are no longer controlled by the Ministry of Lobour we are receiving an increased number of applications. With kind regards to Mrs. Belgrave, Yours sincerely, ( SGD ) M. GAWAN TAYLOR.
