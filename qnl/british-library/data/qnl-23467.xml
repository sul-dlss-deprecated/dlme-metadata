In reply to your D/0 No.312 of 20/2/30., the question of a crane for the Pier is at present, I understand, under the consideration of the Adviser; and until I get his sanction to its purchase, I am not able to obtain tenders. In order to ascertain what the possible cost of such a crane in Bahrein would be; in September last the Resident Engineer of Messrs Callenders Cable &amp; Construction Coy Ltd obtained full particulars and prices, which he submitted to the Adviser for his consideration. Also, blue prints and cost were submitted some time ago by Mespers. The height of the dock is ten feet, and the height of the high-water mark is six feet above sea-bed.

NOTE ON THE CUSTOMS PIER. The Customs Pier at present is 825 feet in length on its west side, and 780 feet in length on its east side. Its width at the entrance 'is 70 feet, and at its head, 140 feet. Its average height ahove the sea-bed is ten feet, which allows an average of four feet above an average high tide. The Import Shed and the Pier were constructed und er Customs' supervision by means of a loan raised in Bahrein among the local merchants. The security for the repayment of t he loan was a tax known as 'pier Fees' levied upon all cargo. This tax was based upon the class of cargo (not its value ) and was generally: one-half anna per bag and one anna per other package. The construction of the Customs Pier was commenced about the year A.D.1914, and continued periodically until 1922, the stone being brought from the reefs for the main body of the pier, and from inside the island for the facing walls, and was dressed on the pier by a Karachi mason named Chiragdin^Daloo. The construction was not carried out as one definite contract, o^t rather as funds became available for the work. On 18th Saiar 1336 (equivalent to December 1917) for example, H.E.Sheikh Easa ordered that the question of extending the work then completed should be considered later on. In 1922 it appears that, all the loans having been repaid, the Pier Fee tax was reduced down to its present rate of one pice per bag, and two pice per other package, and it has since^been continually collected on the understanding, I believe, tnat the funds raised should be applied to maintenance, repairs, and if necessary extension of the Pier. The collections- — have in fact gone into the Consolidated Fund, simi larly with all other collections; and repairs have been paid for direct n by the G-overnment of Bahrein. On 21st September, 1923, Mr G-.N.Bower (the Special Officer brought to reorganise the Customs) wrote a note regarding the Pier which might be summarised to the effect that 'the difficulty with the existing Pier is that it is not accessible to boats at low water' This means that the ferry traffic between Maharaq. and Manama as well as the loading and discharge of cargo are practically at a stand-still at the hours of low tide, i.e. practically half of a working day, for native craft work is not permitted at night-time. The question therefore naturally arises:- i (a) Would the cargo-work on the pier, i.e. the landing of cargo for steamers for import, and the loading of cargo into native craft for export,(to say nothing of the passenger traffic between Manama and Maharaq.) be improved or facilitated oj such an.extension of the pier that it would oe independent of the tides and also, , . _ ,, (b) Would the cost of such an extension justify tne result . The reply to (a-L is undoubtedly 'yes'; and 1 believe it is correct to state . that the continuance of the Pier Fee , Wb| approved by the local merchants on the understandi 'd - cash so collected would be applied for that purpose, altei maintenance and repairs had been accounted for., srsi' 01 'litst.z SSii •SS .JIrS '.'S .n sL .t high' seas rising on the shumal, and calm water ■ o f-2- &lt;nM' in + a north -westerly direction, -f-v^ 4.- p f 6 at 1 ' ts head, at least 60 feet lonr. Sinrp the existing trolley line service would have to be ext ended so far m order to operate the landed cargo, the extended oier nust be wide enough to contain the landed cargo, and afford space for free running of the trolleys which remove it A double line of trolleys of 2 ft.ga^gerequire about t^lve feet running space, consequently an allowance of thirty feet is leastHf nv ? r ^^ heilCe the ^ould bfat The ltS Wldth at its Present entrance. QiL ^ ^ as at P resent . as ^r as the outer side 01 the fesht; out beyond that into the deep water I think a I )1 ® r ' , 7- of wood, re-inforced concrete, and steel piles, would be best, having regard to the increasing depth, swell and exposure. ^ ' ' The effect of such an erection would be that import cargo could be landed, and export cargo could be discharged, and passenger traffic could proceed independently of the tides a great boon to all the population of Bahrein. ... 0n ' t; ^ e other hand it might be remarked that if the jisr to Maharaq is ultimately built, there will be no passenger traffic by sea to and from Maharaqj and (2) a tide missed or a day missed in shipping export cargo does not greatly matter in Bahrein, for from the Arab point of view time is not necessarily 'the essence of the contract'. But (3) it is undeniable that nowadays the discharge of cargo from steamers is dependent upon the tides, and with such an extension, cargo steamers' discharges could be dealt with by the agents in probably half the time taken at present. Consenuently the greatest benefit would enure to the steamship companies cringing cargoes to this port by the consequent economy in rumming costs due to the speedier discharge of their cargoes. A prompt discharge is helpful to a mail steamer but an ordinary cargo steamer is not so heavily pressed for time. The largest proportion of cargo is brought to this port by the b. I, S.IT. Coy' s Steamers, and this company would derive the greater benefit from such an extension. 1 understand that the cost of building the present pier amounted to about five lakhs of rupees. I do not think the cost of the extension would be much less than three lakhs, even under my careful supervision. The Pier Fees account would in time provide this sum, remembering that up to date over two lakhs have teeen collected and most of this lodged in the Consolidated Fund. Against this collection there are the payments out for (1) building the present head of the Pier, (2) laying the present surface on the Pier, (3) the cost of the new Pier Shed, (4) the cost of the existing trolley service, (5) the cost of re-roofing the Import Shed, (6) the general maintenance expenditure for painting etc., and (7) the expected cost of electrically lighting the whole Customs, which ought to be charged to the Pier Fees account. These re all lieavy items, and ought to be brought into account, to ascertain the present credit balance of the Pier Fees account. Inferentially, a further query arises.... Since the B.I.S.N,Coy Ltd., are likely to derive the most benefit from such an extension, would they be prepared to assist in its cost; and, if yea, upon what terms ? The reply to this is unknown, since (as far as I know) the Company have never been so approached. Alternatively, might the work be regarded as such a public improvement as the G-overnment oi Bahrein might be inclined to undertake for the public welfare?I NCORPORATI NG:- STEPHEN LYNCH &amp; C9 LYNCH BROTH EPS, L T P GRAY, MACKENZIE 8.

We rather feel that such facilities should keep pace with the new developments on the island. 1. Improvements which we consider important are: Widening of the pier to afford proper drive way to pier head for lorries. 2. A power driven Crane, capacity of which should be at least 10 tons. We would like to point out that handling of material at Sitra is only a temporary measure. A considerable amount of material and equipment will be handled over the Manama Pier by The Bahrein Petroleum Company for quite a few years and it seems likely that shipments of heavy material will go from here to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and that they will also have transhipments of heavy material for some time to come.

J ■IHE GTBTOMHOUSE: , , , BAHRAIN: No. GT/HL/1/158 12th August, 1936., E3rd Jamad i., 1355•, i'he Adviser, i'he Government of Bahrain. MEMORANDUM; - In reply to your No:592/3/A., of the 11-5-55., which enclosed copy of letter No-.PA'-587 from The Chief Local Representative of The Bahrain Petroleum ^oy i«td., to H.B.I^s Political ^.gent, Bahraii it might be well to recall the development of the Customs Pier at Manamah. 2. Man^r years ago, a small jetty about three hundred feet long and seventy feet wide was built; and this was found to be in^ sufficient. In 1335 A.H., a local loan of Rs.50,000/- was raised by which the Pier was extended to 800 feet in lengh with^an end width of 75 feet. To repay this loan, a tax known as r Pier Fees 1 was created, being one anna on each package, and one-half anna on each bag. This loan was duly repaid; bui the tax was conti nued with the idea of further extending the pier until deep water was reached, when the loading ana discharge of cargo should be independent of the tides. This extension has yet to be effec ted. 3. i'he receipts from the Pier iJ'ees were duly paid into the Con solidated fund; and this x und bore the cost of further improve ments; namely, the building of a wall with steps at the head; the levelling of the Pier; the construction of the Pier ohed; the construction of a Trolley Line svstem, which has proved 9!' great assistance towards the speedier handling of cargo; the little docks, and the little mole, 4. In 1342 A.H., the opecial Officer recommended that the Pier Fees should form a Sinking ifund for the maintenance and extenr sion of Customs premises. The collection from this tax during the past ten years have aggregated about Rs:2,40,000/-. 5. The quantities of steamers cargoes, apart from Native Craft, have been steadily increasing, and are likely to increase, ^he present space is insufficient for current needs. It would be of great benefit to the ^tate of Bahrain if the Pier were extended to fulfil its original purpose,i.e. to deep water, and thus be come independent of the tides. But an extension in lengh only, v/ould be: insufficient and create congestion at the head of the Pier to about two hundred feet. It should also be remembered that the Pier is the private property of The Government of Bahrain not a public thoroughfare. 6. I submit that the time is now ripe for this extension, and the Sinking ifund, as originally suggested, should operate. od/ C. C. L. de u renier BIR2CT0R OF CUSTOMS, and PORT OFFICER.

No; GT/HL/2/163 The Adviser, The GoverniiBnt■ of Bahrain: mORMDUM: In reference to your No.592-3/1 of the 30th July, and to its enclosure; I would refer to paragraph one therein, I should be obliged if it may be pointed out to The Bahrain Petroleum Coy that the Customs pier at Manamah is not a public highway, but is, m fact, private property. v Permission has been granted as an act of courtesy only, ^for the Company T s lorries to drive down the Pier for the purpose of removing stores imported; but this courtesy is not extended to the indiscriminate use of the Pier by all kinds of vehicles serving the Company, nor does it imply that the Company 1 s lorries are entitled to use the Pier. Sd- C.S.L.deGrenier DIRSGTOR OF CUSTOMS, and PORT OFFICER,BAHRAIN.V Bahrain, Dated August 19 ? 1936 Jamad-al-tharii 1, 1355 I ^ D.O.No. My dear Hickinbotham, In reference to my reply to your No. I -'iU' relating to an enquiry by The Bahrain Petroleum Company as to the extension of the Customs Pier at Manamah, I feel sure that i am expressing Air. Belgrave T s opinion when I say that it is generally agreed that the extension is desirable, bul that it is unprofitable to extend the Pier a short distance only. The original intention of extending the Pier to the fesht,so that cargo discharge may be independent of the tides, should be carried into effect as the Pier at present is congested. It has not been possible to do this recently owing to financial considerations with which you are no doubt fully acquainted; and the Government is now engaged upon an active building programme which must be completed before further improvements are undertaken. 1 think, however, that after his re turn ? Air. Belgrave will consider a scheme for this much needed extension. Y our^aincer e ly, t Captain I. Hickenbotham, x.^. . The H. B.
