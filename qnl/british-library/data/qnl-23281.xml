Bahrain, 31st July 1944. ( To The Hon'ble the Political 'Rosldont In the Persian Gulf, 'amp Shiraz. MEMORANDUM Reference Note dated 28th July 1944 by the Political Officer Trurlal ''oast on Provost Personnel for the U.3.A.A.F. at Sharjah. 2. You will observe from paragraph 4 of the above note that the Political Offl^er^Trucial 'oast^has mooted the question of provost personnel with the R.A.F. and U.S.A.A.P. Station Com manders. You may consider that no further action need be taken. I myself consider that it Is desirable to move for the provision of a small forr»e of, say, five American provost personnel (one sergeant and four men) and that we should move for this early on the following grounds. (a) Although there have been no incidents to date the present i number of American personnel is sufficient to warrant provision of police control because; (1) of the poor amenities and restricted conditions of Sharjah which no doubt place a special strain on personnel posted there; (11) of the legal position which does not afford the' Americans the safeguards offered by our jurisdiction in Bnhraln. This makes it especially desirable that discipline be maintained. The provision'of provost personnel should have a steadying effect and be a considerable deterrent apart from providing punishment for offenders. (b) We would do well in our own Interests to make the above, i.e., (a) (1) and (11) clear to higher Amerlcnn authority before any incident develops, suggesting that provost personnel be provided and recoraraending joint patrols. (c) The proposal would be in line with recent correspondence received recommeiiding the elimination of possible causea of Anglo-American friction (vide your office endorsement No.^/^S dated the 15th July 1944). . ^CP 2. % 3. I consider also that if it is confirmed that a substan tial inoroaso of Amerioan pnrsonnol io to be stationed at Sharjah then we should move for- a corresponding increase in the number of provost personnel, in proportion as to whether the additional personnel is permanent or transit• 4. I asked the Political Officer Tru^ial ^oast about the relations between Mneri^ans and British at Sharjah and he des cribes than as non-existent rather than good or bfid, i.e., each go their own way and there is not mu^h intercourse. I consider this as meaning at least thnt relations are not good. Discipline among the Americans is as usual poor. Their atti tude to the Arab is a mixture of fear (of the kind that makes American crews who force land on the Trucial ^oast afraid that their throats will be cut) and contempt (akin to their antipathy to the American negro.)- v;ithout ovoremphosising this last factor, T think that on the various grounds aentioned above, we would be Justified in commending to the Americans what may be described ns preventive action. 5. Even if you consider that -.ve need not make formnl recom mendations to American higher authority, I think it is desira ble to explain the position to the latter, taking the line that 'you have been warned'.

I disrussod the matter with F/0. Tuxworth (Officiating Officer ^o/n/nanding R.A.F. Staging Post) and with Lieut. Tolly (Officer Commanding U.S.A.A.F.). 3. Lieut. Tolly pointed out that the expansion programme was primarily to cope with transit personnel, from whom no trouble was expected. He very much doubted that his present permanent staff would increase appreciably, and as there had been no trouble so far with these he thought it unnecessary for him to ask for any form of U.S.A. military police. 4. F/0. Tuxworth said he was asking forjn sergeant and four corporals from the military police, chiefly as a patrol for the camp at night to try and stop natives pilfering. He suggested that Lieut. Tolly might consider having a similar small token force of Provost Personnel, so that British and American patrols could go out in pairs and facilitate each others work. Lieut. Tolly said he would consider this, and in fact thought it would be desirable once his camp was complete as some kind of permanent guards would be necessary. 5. The concensus of opinion was that the introduction of any A but a small token force for &amp;uard duties was unnecessary, and ' I agree with this. '&amp;£ ^ ^ ^ 6. The Americans have an order prohibiting exit to motor vehi cles from the camp after dark. I discovered later that this was broken and there had been a ^ase of American officers in a Jeep being seen in a bad quarter of Dubai at about 10 p.m. I was unable to see Lieut. Tolly but asked Tuxworth to take up the matter with him. (Sd.) R.M. HADOW 28th July 1944. Political Officer, Trucial ^oast.tjffo '*/ s A.

Thera is a discrepancy between paragraph 7 of the note and paragraphs 1 and 2 of Air Officer ^om- raanding's telegram No.AA^ 90 dated the 1st July. The Political Officer Trucial '•'oast tells me that Lieut .Tolly* s information was 'as far as he (Tolly) understood'. 2. The point whether the expansion is for permanent or transit personnel requires elucidation, in relation to the question of providing provost personnel, (vide this office memorandum No.^/1140 dated the 31st July 1944, sent by s^me mail). \ , j 4Q.,,.

All the new buildings will take pla^e inside the area made over to H.A. F. by the Shaikh. All construction will be carried out by the H.A.F. has 4. ^olonel ^loments^/stressed most strongly at Hoadquarters that the present building programme in Sharjah (U.S.A., H.A.F., and B.O.A.c.) will not be completed luitil September, and that he is quite unable to undertake any new commitments until the begin- bing of October at the earliest. He has also stu^k out for a clear six mcnths to complete the now work, whi^h would mean it will not be finished until February 19-15. 6. He has budgeted for his requirements of Jus and ^oral ro^k and will forward a statement of this from Basra. His labour requirements will be the same as at present, i.e., a permanent force of 400 coolies, 70 masons, and 30 carpenters. There should be no difficulty in obtaining this loyally. 6. Wing n o mander Searle said that from the latest news he had in Cairo he thought it extremely unlikely that the scheme would go through. 7. I then saw Liefct. Tolly (commanding Officer Station for U.S. A.A.F.). He pointed out that the scheme was not a 300^ increase in his present staff, and indeed ho could never find work for more than a total of 80 men. The scheme was a 300% increase in building accommodation,and was intended to house up to 300 transit personnel at one time, should there be a rush, when the mai|^ air forces are switched from the Western theatre of the war to the Eastern. The new construction only consisted of barrack blo-ks and latrine and ablution installations. _ nQ/1/ . (Sd.) R.M. HADOW - 28th ouly iy44.

(I) It will be seen that the Officer Comoandlng (who was Incidentally a Flying Officer acting tenporarily as Officer. Conmanding) considered that he was obliged to leave the Inquiry concerning Anerlcon personnel to the Ox fleer Connandlng U.S.a.T.J. He appears to have been Justified to soiae extent In taking this view regarding disciplinary natters affecting the U.S.A.T.C. (II) To ny aind there were strong indications that the weapon carrier which drove up to the touap with five Americans after the incident was the vehicle concerned* In my opinion these men should have been examined in a joint court of inquiry held by the two Commanding Officers, but it is perhaps understandable why this decision was not taken. (ill) Th^ report contains no mention of a British corporal who accompanied the five Americans. There was nothing to connect him with the actual Incident but I requested the R«A*P» Commanding Officer to re—examine him and we were both convinced that the man knew more than he said. I questioned the man in detail and I did not accept the story that the party wont out to bathe and returned without bathing. II. Report of C,Q, (i) Heference paragraph No.9. The guard who was given a ride back to Camp was examined by me. He did not sub stantlate the story that the Americans merely picked him up on the way back. He said that the latter hs4 been drinking and had offered him cigarettes to cone with them. He did not mention that the Americans been concerned in the incident but I consider thou some reason to believe that he was picked up by for other purposes than merely giving him a lift .slbly as a 'guide'. (11) I do not consider that a sufficiently strict **&lt;7/^ ^ y • was made.
