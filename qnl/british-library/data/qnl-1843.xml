At the opening of the year Oman had barely emerged from a serious convulsion. A treacherous and very formidable insurrection against the Sultan had reduced him to dire straits, when, shut up in the forts which dominated a part of the town, His Highness had to submit to the presence of the rebels in his palace and to their possession of the greater part of his town for nearly a month. The report for the past year has been compiled by Major J. H. Sadler, and follows as part II. The repair of the damages caused by the hostile occupation, improvement of the defences, and a strengthening of the armament of the forts was the first matter demanding the attention of the ruler. On our part it was necessary to examine into, and to determine as closely as might be possible, the losses intiicted on British subjects during the outbreak, and to consider the means for indemnifying them'. The loss and injury had been great, there had been pillage which was not confined to the acts of the Sultan's enemies, and wanton destruction had been caused by incendiarism. The enquiry into these matters was very laborious and resulted in sn assessment of over seventy-seven thousand dollars as the total amount of the losses sustained by British subjects, and to meet these the Sultan was authorised by Government to impose on the produce of the tribes, to whose excesses and violence it was due, a punitive tax to provide compensation, the term for the complete liquidation of which was fixed at three years. The working of this tax was very far from satisfactory, the proceeds came in slowly and fell far short of the estimate that had been framed, every device was adopted to evade the taXj the despatch of the date produce to the coast for export was delayed, part of it was shipped at Sur to escape payment and much of it was doubtless, as loudly complained of by the Sultan, passed through the customs at Maskat and Muttrah as the property of friendly tribes. These causes no doubt accounted for a large part of the failure, but the general weakness of His Highness , authority, his inefficient customs organisa tion and a want of firm and energetic effort were also responsible in a great measure for the unsatisfactory result. The Sultan's attitude throughout this matter has not been commendable. His Highness appeared unable to realise the extent of his responsibility for the disastrous injury to the important British interests resulting from the defects of his rule, and seemed to regard his liability as confined to the results of his attempts however feeble to recover indemnity from the actually offending tribes.2 administration report on the persian gulp political The first note of impending trouble at Dhofar on the southern coast of Arabia was sounded in the beginning of the year, when it appeared that the Moplah outlaw, Syed Eadhl bin Alawi, contemplated a revival of his former pretentions to that place. The Sultan was advised to take measures to secure the safety of this remote part of his territory, but neglected to do so. In November the fort was attacked and captured by the AUKathir tribe from the neighbouring upland country, and the son and nephew of the Sultan's Wali, who was himself absent at Maskat, were killed. An expedition despatched by the Sultan for the recovery of Dhofar and the re-establishment of his authority failed owing partly to the Shanifereh tribe declining to co operate as had been hoped, and the Sultan at once appealed to Government to help him, and to check the movement which he alleged to be on behalf of the Moplah Syed Fadhl. The Political Agent was then authorised to proceed to T )hofar in H. M. S. 'Brisk'' in order to effect the best settlement possible under the authority of the Sultan. This mission also failed, the rebel Shaikh and his following being found implacably hostile to Maskat and the Sultan's rule as exercised by his Wali Shaikh Suliman bin Suweilam having incurred much odium. The Turkish flag had been hoisted by the rebels, but the concern of the Moplah outlaw with the movement was not clearly estab lished. The Sultan proposed to be ready to send reinforcements to recover Dhofar if supported by us and was informed that the advance of his troops would be covered by the fire of the guns of H. M. S. 'Brisk' from the anchorage. The condition of this prolTered aid being that in the future arrangement of Dhofar affairs our advice should be followed. Much apathy and delay was however evinced in the preparations, and shortly after the close of the year under report the Saltan finally decided against the expedition, giving as the ground for rejecting the aid proffered by Government, that he could not bind himself to follow our advice in the future arrangements at Dhofar without beinsr informed what that advice would be. Nezwah, the former capital, and therefore enjoying a certain prestige, was recovered for the Sultan, who had long desired its restoration. The ac quisition was probably a costly one to His Highness. Sayyid Saood bin Azzan made an attempt on Sohar in the Batineh, but the timely despatch of small reinforcements by a steamer which happened to be present sufficed to frustrate the attack. Trade has been satisfactory. The returns show a substantial increase, excluding specie, on the figures for last year, the improvement being nearly equally divided between exports and imports. 2.—OMAN PIRATE COAST. Reports having been received of an importation of slaves at Abu Dthabi, the matter formed the subject of investigation in a visit which the Resident made to the coast in February in the K. I. M. 8. c&lt; Lawrence' accompanied by 11. M. S. ' Lapwing. ' It was diificult to obtain exact details, there being a general reluctance to give evidence as to specific facts or figures. Prom the enquiry, however, the conclusion was clear that there had been importation by sea, and that a considerable number bad been brought to Abu Dthabi, some being probably passed on to Katr and other places. The chief could not deny the fact that there had been an importation, but, in admitting the fact of the traffic, sought to defend himself by alleging the general prevalence, without check, of the traffic, and its long continuance with the knowledge of every person on the coast, and asserting that only a part of the slaves brought to the coast reached Abu Dthabi, after a number had been disposed of at the intermediate ports touched at. It being impossible to fix the number of slaves for the importation of whom the chief was respon sible with any exactitude, while it was evident that it could not be small, it was taken at forty, and a fine of dollars 2,100 was imposed upon the chief, after a deduction on account of nine slaves whom he produced and delivered. These, together with another who effected his own escape, were taken on board and carried to Bushire, where they were set free.HESIDENCT AND MA.SKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE TEAT, 1895-96. 3 Ko confirmation of the allegations of the chief of Abu Dthahi regarding the participation by ports other than his own in the trade, by sea, in slaves was forthcoming. It is to be feared, however, that the other towns are not exempt from the responsibility of a share in it and the existence of a trade over land from the Batineh Coast of Maskat, was generally admitted ; the oppor tunity was therefore taken to address a serious warning to the various chiefs in the course of the tour. The trade in slaves overland is beyond our reach, but if means could be found to put an effectual stop to the importation from Africa to Sur, whence slaves are carried to the Batineh, and thence distributed by sea and land to places further up the Gulf, a heavy blow would be struck at the root of this atrocious evil. In August a party of the Manasir tribe started from Katr upon an expedition which was rumoured to be a pillaging-raid. Timely notice of the movement enabled the Shaikhs to make preparations for resisting them, and the enterprise assumed a more peaceful character. Debai, Shargah and Um-el- Kawein were visited and gifts received from the Shaikhs. At Hamraniyeh, however, the Manasir managed to get the people oil their guard and to carry off a number of their animals and a few slaves. A Turkish subject proceeding down the Ajmancreek to embark in a vessel outside was shot dead from the bank by a watchman who, on Ciiaiien^iiig the partv, had failed to get a reply. The act, though perhaps culpably rash, was not of the nature of an intentional murder : the watchman was at once appre hended by the chief and the Residency made a representation of the tacts through the Assistant Political Agent at Busrah with the object of preventing reprisals on Annan subjects visiting Busrah. A Shura court decided that the chief was free from all liability which rested on the watch man alone, but did not fix the amount of compensation to be paid, it being understood, however, that redress of this nature should be given. As the result of communications with the Turkish Yice-Consul at Bushire the relations of the deceased waived all claim against Ajman and the matter ended. At the close of the year the chief of Debai, together with the son of the Abu Dthabi chief, visited the Sultan of Maskat. The object of this visit, though there were certain rumours about it, was not divulged. A serious fire occurred in Debai in August, some sixty houses in tue suburbs being destroyed, and one life lost. 3.—BAHRAIN. In the report for last year the troubles which threatened Bahrain at its close were noticed. These increased and became serious, the Al bm Ali tribe being supported in their contumacy and resistance to their chief by Shaikh Jasim bin Mahomed Thani with whose countenance they obstinately insisted on maintaining the obnoxious settlement at Zobara, m defiance of the clearest warning that this would in no case be permitted. Shaikh Jasim and the Al bin AU tribe under Shaikh Sultan bin Salamah were encouraged in the ao-cressive attitude they had assumed towards Bahrain by the provincial furkish officials, the gravity of the situation being there by much increased. ■Warnin' and remonstrance being unavailing, it became necessary fo adopt measures of coercion, and H. M. S. ' Sphinx ' accordingly under the instructions of Government seized some of the boats ol the rebel loustn e. But this step which in ordinary course should have sufficed to bring he A to Ali to reason, failed in its object, owing to the vigorous outside support eiven to this tribe, who, after their cause had been taken up by Shaikh Jasam fnd the local Turks, were probably not quite free agents. A number of boats sent from Bahrain to Zobara to bring over the family of one of the leading members of the Al bin Ali who had made his peace with the chief of Bahrain were accordingly seized and detained at Zobara under the auspices of fehaiKh A few Turkish troops with a minor official had some time leiore boon established at Zobara and the Ottoman flag had been hoisted, ana a senoiis com plexion had thus been given to what in its origin had been a diflerence between/ 4 ADMINISTRATION REPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL the Bahrain chief and a tribe on that island, which admitted of no outside interference. A small Turkish war-vessel also appeared on the scene and remained some time oil Zobara; her presence, notwithstanding the declared obiect of the commander to protect Bahrain, undoubtedly tending to encourao-e the hostile attitude. The situation daily became more strained and the combination against Bahrain more threatening, till in August the Mutaserrif of El Hasa addressed a bombastic letter to the liesident reasserting Turkish pretension and intimating that failing a restoration of the boats seized by H. M. S. ' Sphinx ' an attack would be made by the tribes of the Katr peninsula on Bahrain, from which British subjects should accordingly be removed within seventeen days Before this II.M.S. c&lt; Pigeon' had also proceeded to Bahrain and on bein^ despatclied to Zobara received an order from the petty local official to depart under threat of attack and intimation that the large fleet of Arab craft Ivino- there was prepared for an attack on Bahrain. Matters had now reached a crisis and the date named by the El Hasa official for hostilities against Bahrain bad arrived. Instant action for the safety of Bahrain was thereupon decided on bv the Senior Naval Officer as necessary, and after due warning both ships opened fire on the hostile fleet, of which about 40 were disabled. Shaikh Jasim the following morning offered full submission, and in compliance with Captain Pelly's demands some 120 more of the boats at Zobara were surrendered anrl removed to Bahrain. After this severe but most necessary lesson, the A1 bin Ali tribe with the exception of Shaikh Sultan and a few adherents returned to Bahrain and to their allegiance, under assurances of indulgent treatment and the conditions of life they had previously enjoyed. The final proceedings in connection with this matter were only completed at the close of the year. Shaikh Jasim was informed in February 1896 of the decision of Government, to the effect that as the main instigator of these disturbances ha was fined thirty thousand rupees, failing payment of which the captured boats would be destroyed. He however repudiated responsibi lity in the matter, sheltering himself behind alleged orders for all his acts from the Turkish authorities and professed to have resigned the quasi-oiWcitxl autho rity he held from them in Katr, and his own real personal influence. In these circumstances an opening to redeera/their own boats, by payin^ a pro portionate share of tlie indemnity, was offered to the tribes and was availed of to the extent ot one-third of the amount; the remaining boats were destroyed a few days after the close of the year. Thus ended an episode which had imperilled the welfare and progress of Bahrain with which we have for long past had close and friendly relations, and where a trade of some importance, involving considerable British Indian inter ests, has been established. There can be no doubt that our effective support of the integrity and independence of Bahrain and resistance to foreign pre tension and outside interference, has had a very salutary effect on that coast. The death of Shaikh Sultan bin Salamah in November at the hands of certain men of the Ammamerah tribe who fell in with him at sea off Ras-Tan- nurah near Katif and fired on his boat, was a most regretable incident. The Shaikh had been the leader of the A1 bin Ali in their defiance of the authority of the Bahrain chief, who was naturally reluctant to punish the Ammamerah and who became therefore liable for some of the ill-feeling excited oy this act. 4.—NEJD. Disorder and insecurity on the trade routes were caused by the predatory raids of the Ajman, Al Murrah and other tribes under the nominal suzerainty of the Turks. In June the caravan traffic bet ween Nejd and Kowait was thus interrupted, and in October Mahomed Ibn Kashid appealed to the Governor of El Hasa to guarantee the safety of the roads to Nejd and Kasseem, failing which he claimed discretion himself to chastise the tribes named, as disturbers of the peace of his territories.EESrfiEKCT AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOil THE TEAR 1895-96. 5 5.—EL HAS A. The Governor of El Hasa with the object of gaining credit with his Government, undertook an expedition for the purpose of establishing a more effective and profitable Turkish control over the Ajman, A1 Murrah and other tribes, who had hitherto paid only a nominal tax. The Ajman while admitting his demands pleaded their inability to pay without recovery of their property ^pillaged by the Muteyr and seized by Mahomed Ibn Eashid. The Governor accordingly attacked the Muteyr with the help of the Ajman and other tribes, capturing some of their animals. He was then summoned to Busrah, and after his return was active in encouraging the hostile attitude taken by Shaikh Tasim bin Mahomed Thani in support of the A1 bin Ali resistence to the Bahrain chief which has already been noticed. 6.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. The Kizam -es-Sultaneh was appointed to the Governor-Generalship in March and held the office throughout the year. Notwithstanding that the harvest was favourable, one of the earlier mea sures of the year was the imposition of an embargo on the export of grain. The notice oiven of the enforcement of this vexatious prohibition vyas too short for the reasonable requirements of trade operations, the locai conditions necessita- tin 0, arrangements considerably in advance, for the purchase and transport of orain the/securing of freight and other matters, an extension ol' it was there fore, though with some difficulty, obtained. The proceedings in connection with this obnoxious measure were uncer tain and irregular and were so devised as to entail the maximum of restriction on straightforward foreign trade while failing in an effective realisation of the ostensible object, the retention of the grain in the country. It was evaded by the convevance in native craft of grain to Busrah, whence it could readily be exnorted •'the transit overland from the Howeizah district^ to the river at Eusrah was open, and shipment from the port of Mashur which taps the Ram Hormuz district was unrestrained. The sale of their produce to the best advantage bv the people on the lower Karun was however no doubt to some extent prevented, and the Shaikh oE Mohammerah and the Arabs under him complained of the difficulty of meeting their taxes. Complete uncertainty prevailed as to the probable duration of the embai go, the indication being that it was governed by arbitrary and interested consider- ation and after a while indeed that its relaxation would depend on pecuniary ar- rano -ements with the authorities. Foreign merchants accordingly continued their purchase of wheat in the district; but this obviously would not suit the projects for forcino- the merchants into a permanent arrangement pecuniarily advanta geous to Those interested, and purchases as well as the collection of purchased stocks and their removal for storage were prohibited. In January there was an onpn though still quite irregular relaxation, the Governor-General permitting r export of certain stoeks! at the same moment that the^ Central Government nvonosed to admit it, on condition that no fresh purchases should be made till the nex^ crop should be assured. The facts that the Karguzar, Apnt of the Foreign Office, repudiated the autbority of the Governor-General, while the Shaikh Gov ernor of Mobammerah claimed to levy a gam on his own account the duty which bad alreadv been paid to the Governor-General, shows the utter confusion and conflict of autbority in all the irregular proceedings in this connection. The Central Government overruled both these obstructors In March the Governor- General aaain capriciously stopped export, though by that time there could hardlv be a doubt of the abundance of the approaehmg harvest, aud finally soon after native and foreign merchants were freely shipping and the embargo was tacitly at an end, though, as far as official notification is concerned, it remained in full force as originally promulgated. Some attempt to open up and improve the safety of trade routes inland from the upper Karun and Diz rivers was made ; the results however by no means came up to the hopes founded on the Nizam-es-Sultaneh s earlier pro- fessions.6 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL The Surs caused some trouble; the Al-Kathir tribe, incensed at the aliena tion of lands they claimed, began raiding near Dizful, and a punitive expe dition became necessary. Bands of lawless Surs however, by their depredations' caused the desertion of many villages in that district. In order to recover taxes, the payment of which had been resisted bv the Beni Truf tribe of the Hovveizah district, a raid under Syed Naamah was directed against them and a large number of their cattle was seized and carried off. The tribe followed in order to recover the animals, and towards the close of the year under report a critical position had been brought about by the highhanded proceedings which the Governor-General had taken. A most brutal attack, which might have had the gravest and even a fatal result, was committed on British subjects in November by the soldiers stationed at Ahwaz. These men maintained ostensibly for the preservation of peace and order, have in fact on this and other occasions lent themselves to violence and excess. On this occasion the representatives of Messrs. Lynch Brothers were proceeding in a perfectly orderly manner to lodge a complaint with the local Governor against the soldiery, whose highhanded and lawless proceedings in prosecuting an utterly unjustifiable search had caused a serious/^c«s on board the company's steamer. The soldiers, some of whom w^ere actually on guard at the Governor's House, resenting this lawful and most temperately conducted action, rushed to their arms and most savagely assaulted the gentlemen, caus ing serious injuries, lor this gross outrage no redress had been given up to the close of the year under report, for though a show of it was made by the arrest of some of those concerned in the fracas on the steamer,—a matter of comparatively quite insignificant moment,—the actual perpetrators of the sub sequent brutal violence were allowed to escape. A new company under the name of Shah-in-Shahi was established under tne auspices of the Muez-es-Sultaneh and certain Shushta merchants for the carrying trade on the Karun. . iJifficulties appeared in the levy of duty on goods, ow T ing to the conflictino' interests therein of the authorities at the mouth of the river, and of the Govern- whose sphere o!: control inland hardly extends in an effective form to Mohammerah. Double demands were accordingly made, and the matter was not auanged without an appeal to the Central Government. . In the summer an outbreak of cattle disease on the Turkish side of the river spread to Mohammerah and the Karun; it continued with occasional reappearance till the winter, but on the whole with much milder effect than in 1 urkish territory and no serious loss occurred. 7.—FARS AND PERSIAN COAST. Pars continued under the control of His Royal Highness Rukn-ud-Dowlah whose reappointment for a second year to the Governor-Generalship of the pro vince was made public early after the Persian new year. His Royal Highness appointed his son, Am-ul-Mulk, Governor of certain of the nomad tribes, and subsequently also of Lanstan, and his younger son, Nasrullah Mirza, Governor of Ivazeran. Buslnre and the Gulf ports were retained by His Excellency w p? 1 ^ towards the end of the year a very determined cabal was med against his authority. The ostensible cause seized upon to brin' 1 matter to an issue was an imprudent attempt to construe as an order for peiemptory deportation and to carry out with some indignity, instructions from frv nf ^}ip + suggestmg the desirability of the temporary absence from the coun- try the titular head of the mercantile community, the Malek-ut-Tujjar who /nTh P0 ThlTr C n e A ^ ge ln a n ? i S hhouri ^ shrine known as the Imam • ' s a usp . le greatest excitement and a very general and vigorous WaS ea f y SOt Bazaa ^ shops, and offices were the completely to a standstill and the people besieged mannor of . g r P • ^ day aild ^ large crowds' after the r er of the populace in lersia whose first resort in times of public dis- T~t?nFZ 1C 18 t0 the , tele 1 f ra P 1 !- No haste was shown by the Central Gov- ernment to take measures to allay the excited popular feeling by the issue of.y—- % e r8 Stalk of thei RESIDENCY AND MASEAT POLITICAL AGENCY EOR THE YEAH 1895-96. 7 clear orders, but it gradually became apparent that the cause of the malcontents gained ground, iirst the Hamal Bashi, who had been allowed to draw into his own hand altogether too many functions and too much power, and who had become the object of very general resentment, suddenly fled, and this was followed early in March by the resignation by the Kowam-ul-Mulk of the Governorship a fortnight before the Vernal equinox from which all changes and new appoint ments in Persia date. Temporary and imperfect arrangements for the divided control of public affairs were somewhat tardily made, but these nevertheless owing to the fact that the popular party was ^ in the ascendant, sufficed to maintain order. Haji Mirza Abdullah Khan, who had long been Karguzar, and had also latterly held the Deputy Governorship of Bushire, died in June 1895. During the year under report Shiraz has not been exempt from the evils from which it lias suffered in late years—the results both of natural causes and maladministration. The oft repeated tale has continued throughout the year of disorder, plunder, and the laying waste of cultivation by various sections of the nomads; of general lawlessness, resistence to authority, and risings against petty local Governors; of attacks by one tribe on another, and of punitive expeditions or raids directed by the authorities to recover revenue or to coerce the refractory. The Kushkais generally and the Yekdar section of that tribe in particular were prominent in disorder. In October an arrangement, in the usual spirit of Persian dealings with the nomads, was reported to have been arrived at with the lawless tribe, and appears to have taken the form of a com promise of the terms of revenue to be paid, and the presentation of a khillat. The Baharloos also have been very turbulent. An expedition for the arrest of one of the leaders was sent under the conduct of another chief of the same tribe in May ; there was a collision between the parties, and immediately afterwards it was reported that orders from the Central Government for assur ances of safety to the leader whom it was sought to arrest had been received. A little later the leader of the arresting expedition himself fled, and, assuming open hostility, took to pillage and violence. An example of the lengths to which, under the method of the Govern ment, arbitrary violence under the guise of authority can proceed, appears in the measures for the arrest of an offender of the Soorkhi tribe. The Command er of the Governor's bodyguard being sent on this duty was reported to have attacked the people of the tribe, and indiscriminately plundered their property to a. very large amount, thus driving them into outlawry. A case of oppression of a Russian (Shirwani) subject called forth a most vigorous remonstrance from that Government, with the result that the Ferrash Bashi who had seized and beaten him in enforcing a demand for taxes was sent with the usual apparatus to the house of the victim, and only escaped severe public punishment by the grace of the outraged party on an ample apology being made by two high officials. Some insecurity prevailed on the road near Shiraz and towards Ispahan. In June the courier with legation despatches for Bushire was shot by robbers; he finally recovered. The Persian post was three times attacked towards Ispahan, parcels to a large amount being plundered, and the posthorses were carried off close to Shiraz. Locusts appeared in spring and complaints of their ravages near Shiraz and in other parts of the province continued till July. The districts included in the Governorship of Bushire and the Gulf ports were not free from disorder. In Dashtistan an attempt to transfer the sole charge of a tract to one of the two chiefs who had hitherto shared it, was resisted by the other, Ahmed Khan, who shot his rival dead. A punitive expedi tion was then organised under instructions from the capital, a detachment with a small naval gun being sent out. Ahmed Khan being joined by some of the people of Tangistan and Shabankara was able to maintain his resistance, till a small reinforcement was despatched, and at the same time, orders to effect an amicable settlement. He was then induced to present himself at :i I 111 If i m 8 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Bushire with a strong armed following and received a firman from the Gover nor investing him with the authority in dispute. At JCahiri on the coast Shaikh Ibrahim resisted by force the transfer to another of the post he had held and maintained his position in the fort, necessitating the despatch of a con siderable force for his expulsion. At Lmgah some alarm was caused by the violence of one Sved Yusuf who, having Ivilled a nitin, e\ad('Ci the attempt made to arrest him, and brought a party to the attack of the fort. A more vigorous attempt at his arrest under the direction of the Kawam-ul -Mulk also failed, as did an effort to induce him to return to Lingah. In the early part of the year there was much uneasiness in Bushire in consequence of the frequent acts of robbery and violence in the immediate neighbourhood. throughout the year. Grain export again lay under a nominal embargo It was freely evaded for most of the period ; indeed one of its objects would appear to be the opportunity afforded by it for the levy of an illegitimate cess for connivance at its evasion without an open violation of the treaty rights governing the duties in foreign trade. The rainfall for the winter of 1895-96 was remarkably deficient in the Bushire district, only 4 )'75 inches being registered, or a little over one-third of the normal fall. There was also serious failure oi rain at l&gt;undar Abbas and Lingah. The distress which at the latter place was becoming acute was relieved by a copious fall which filled the reservoirs at the very end of March. No epidemic visited Bushire and the public health was on the whole good. Pever prevailed to a somewhat greater extent than in the preceding year, but was not of a severe type. Shiraz suffered much from fever of a more viru lent nature, from which the greater part of the population suffered ; it caused a sjood deal of mortality. There was also a rather serious epidemic of cattle disease, from which many animals perished. A postal service was established between Bushire and Arabistan. The series of observations for the telegraphic determination of longitudes was resumed in March between Tehran and Bushire, the final link connecting India with Greenwich being thus completed. 8.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN AND MAKE AN. Sirteep Zain-ul-Abedin continued to hold the Governorship of Bampur. He appears to have made a vigorous effort to increase the revenue derived from Dashtiyari; the people complained loudly and in January it was reported that two thousand of them had emigrated. The British India traders ot the district and of Gharbar joined in these complaints, alleging that their trade was being ruined owing to the exactions of the Governor and the depopulation of the countrv. The peace of this region was also disturbed by a conflict between the two brothers, Abdi Khan and Mahomed Khan, owing to the authority of the former having been*transferred to his brother on account of his misrule. There was a very unfortunate case of the disappearance of a Hindu trader at Gwetter under circumstances wTiich pointed strongly to foul play. A servant of the Hindu w T as sent to the native assistant at Gwadur by Sirdar Mahomed Ali, the local Persian authority, who had obtained a confession that he had mur dered his master. The confession was of a most doubtful character, and the servant implicated two men of Sirdar Mahomed Ali who had denounced him as being themselves the actual murderers. The evidence in the case was of a most unsatisfactory nature being confined to the discredited statements of per sons probably connected with the act, and it is to be feared that there is little hope of justice being reached. Several of the Baluch leaders from the neighbourhood collected at Jask in April with large followings, and there w T as some excitement; their object appeared to be the nomination of a responsible chief for the district, and they agreed to keep the peace if the Governor of Bundar Abbas would meet their wishes.

There are many indications of a considerable and perhaps indeed an increased activity in tins nefarious traffic recently. In the course of the intimate concern with the affairs of Bahrain, involved in our support of it, through the trouble with which it was threatened from Zobara, many circumstances came to light showing that slaves were imported. On the Oman Pirate Coast there was evidence of a brisk trade, as has been noticed in the section on that coast. There is the strongest reason to believe that Sur—low down on the Maskat coast—is the source for supplying the demand for slaves throughout the Persian Gulf. There is undoubtedly a considerable importation to that place, whence slaves are carried to the Batineh, and distributed to the Arab, and even to the Persian coast. The presence of a gunboat off the south-east corner of the Arabian coast, during the slaves running season, would seem the most effectual mode of striking at the root of the evil. Several slaves appealed to or sought refuge in the Residency ; these cases were examined and dealt with on their merits, freedom being secured in some six cases out of eleven. A large number, over forty slaves, sought freedom at Bahrain ; in almost all these cases manumission certificates were obtained from the chief, but the slaves consented for the most part to return and work for their former masters as free men. 10.—PIRACY. During the general disturbance caused by the Bahrain troubles with Zobara some cases of piracy occurred. A peculiarly bold one was under taken singlehanded by an Arab, who obtaining a passage in a bania's boat returning from Katif to Bahrain, suddenly made a most savage and treacherous attack on the bania, who escaped, with the loss of his hand and other serious wounds, by jumping overboard. The Arab then caused the boatmen to land him on the coast and disappeared with the bania's valuables, estimated at Rs. 40,000. Another British Indian vessel was boarded near Katr, one of the crew was killed and others wounded and the property found was carried off. A number of piracies were committed off the mouth of or within the Shat- el-Arab, and also oft the mouth of the Bamishir, the old outlet of the Karun river. Both Turkish and Persian authorities mutually sought to affix the responsibility for these outrages each on the opposite side, but the Arab populations on the two banks have frequent intercourse with each other, and it is in the highest degree probable that they shared in these atrocities. The victims were Persian and Arab, as well as British Indian vessels, and some of the attacks were of a most savage and murderous character, in one case a derelict boat being found with only corpses on board. One of the most serious cases was that of the British Indian buggla' Haripassa ' from Kathiawar, when four men were killed, three wounded and a large amount in money Avas plundered, but though urgent representations were made to both the Persian and lurkish authorities no effective result was reached. 11.—ROYAL NAVY.

Administration report of the Maskat Political Agency for the year 1895-96 JPolitical, —Hie political history of Oman during the past year does not present many features of interest, neither are there any events of importance to record. Shaikh Saleii bin Ali, regarding whom many wild rumours were spread during the year, does not appear to have led any active opposition against the Sultan, possibly by reason of want of money. In the month of April a party of the Harth tribe arrived from Zanzibar in a British steamer. His Highness the Saltan demanded that these persons, who belonged to Saleh bin Ali's tribe and hence enemies of His Highness, should be handed over to him, but there being no proof of the persons in question having committed any offence against His Highness, the request was not complied with. In order, however, to prevent complications, the persons in question were taken on to iiundar A.bbas and landed there. During this month rumours were current that Saleh bin Ali intended snaking a demonstration towards bemail \^ith the object of alienating the Griia' firi tribe from the rule of the Sultan. Many of the Shaikhs from the Semail and Sur came to Maskat during the month of April to visit the Sultan and in order to obtain from him recognition, in the shape of money, of the services rendered to His Highness by them in the rebellion. Amongst others, the Shaikhs of the Jenebeh of Sur, the Beni Boo Aii, Beni Hina, Hishem, Beni Boo, Hasan Beni Umar, Naeem, Beni _ Easib Hiirieen Beni Oomer visited Maskat during the past year, with the object of obtain in money from His Highness the Sultan. This system of subsidising the Shaikhs outside Maskat, which was instituted by Seyyid Turki is a source of great weakness to the Sultan, as naturally the Sheik's demands continue increasing and so payment to them of subsidies without effecting any great good tends to keep the Sultan impoverished. During the month of May and June several small disturbances occurred, in the interior, but none of these disturbances exceeded the normal inter-tribal disputes of past years. The only importance to be attached to these inter-tribal disputes is that Saleh bin Ali on several occasions tried to turn these disputes to account but not successfully. One of the more important of these inter tribal disputes was the one that occurred in June between the j N azar assisted by the Beni Bian and the Yemen with the Beni Kuwahah at Zikki. _This dispute at one time threatened to lead to a general rising and much bloodshed and as Saleh was endeavouring to turn this to account. His Highness deputed his elder brother Sevvid Mahomed bin Turki to proceed to bemail and etlect a settlement. Seyfid Mahomed left in June under an escort of Hinawis and returned in July after restoring tranquillity. In the month ot J uly the Bern Boo Hasan attacked the Beni Boo Ali at Jalaan, hut no very serious consequences ensued. jPuniiivs fctcc oh vcbcl tvihss. —Xn tne month of August His Highness the Sultan decided to impose a punitive tax of 10 per cent, upon the produce of the rebel tribes imported into Maskat and Muttrah, both as a means of punish ment and of meeting the claims of foreigners who suffered losses during the rebellion The chief loss naturally fell upon the British Indian community, and a committee assembled for the purpose of investigating claims under the presi- dency of Surgeon -Colonel Jayakar, found that the claims amounted to over seventy -seven thousand dollars. The fact of this tax being imposed naturally led to resentment amongst the tribes of the Sharkiyyah, and Saleh bin Ali used his best endeavours to turn this to account by attempting to induce the tribes to forget their intei- tribal troubles and jealousies, and to combine against however he was unsuccessful. the Sultan, In this Du ADMINISTRATION REPOllT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Owing to the murder of a lluwalioe hy a Hadramee in September the peace of the Semail valley was again disturbed and fighting ensued between the Gha- frees and the Hinawis. Nothing further occurred in Oman to break the peace until November, when Sheikh Badr bin Hilal bin Zahir of the Beni iima was assassinated at Nezwah by the Betii Shikeyil. This occurrence induced His Highness theSult m to send Suleiman bin Su- weilim, Wali of Dhofar, by the Sur ro id to Nezwah to attempt a reconciliation between the opposing factions, and to induce the Beni Hina in Ghafat to eva cuate Nezwah, and to obtain possession of this, the ancient capital of Oman, for the Sultan. With a view to bringing pressure to bear upon the Beni Hina, Suleiman bin Suweilim obtained possession of Ghafat. This act was naturally viewed with apprehension by Saleh bin Ali and Saood bin Azzan who moved in the direction of Nezwah, but before their intrigues could be of any effect, Su leiman bin Suweilim had already obtained possession of Nezwau by the simple expedient of buying out the garrison. Having successfully accomplished his mission, Suleiman bin Suweilim returned to Mm skat at the end of February, where he was received with great honour by the Sultan who attaches much importance to the town of Nezwah, and thinks that its possession will be of considerable political importance to him. The garrison now holding the town on behalf of the Sultan is said to number about thirty men. T&gt;h'far. —In the month of November trouble was experienced in Dhofar. The Wati of Dhofar, Suleiman bin Suweilim, was very unpopular locally owing to his exactions and unjust government. He having unjustly ordered the imprisonment of a member of the A1 Kathir tribe, sixteen men of the tribe sud denly appeared in Dhofar, attacked the Naib Wali and killed him together with some otlier persons ; and obtained possession of the town. The Sultan accordingly despatched an expedition in December to Dhofar via Merbat. The expedition was under the command of Seyyid Seif bin Hamad and consisted of 180 men. Up to the close of the year under report, this expedition had not moved from Merbat and no steps had been taken to regain possession of Dhofar. bohar. —In the month of December reports were received that Seyyid Saood bin Azzan was making preparations to attack the town of Sohar in the Batineh, Saood had collected a considerable force from amongst the Yal Saad, Mawasineh, Beni Saeed, Makabil and Beni Nairn tribes. The Sultan seeing the necessity for prompt action, despatched a force of 120 men under the command of Shaikh .1 famood bin Nasir, in a steamer which happened to be in the harbour at the time. The arrival of these reinforcements enabled the Wali to repulse the attempt of Saood to seize the town, and Saood was forced to retire. Saood on retiring made a feint at Khabooreh, but here he was also unsuccessful; he thereupon retired and joined Saleh bin Ali and no further trouble was experienced from him during the year under report. General. —In November of the year under report, the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf arrived in Maskat and informed Seyyid Peysal that Her Ma jesty's Government would not permit any further attacks upon either Muttra or Maskat owing to the important interests of British Indian subjects in these places. Slave trade. —There were no seizures of slave-dhows during the year under report. Thirty fugitive slaves took refuge at the Consulate, of these twenty-two were liberated and eight dismissed not being entitled to freedom under the stipulations of the Treaty of 1873. Navy. —Maskat was visited during the year under report by Her Majesty's Ships ' Brisk,' ' Lapwing,' ' Bramble,' 'Sphinx' and 'Plassy,' also by the Royal Indian Marine Ship ' Lawrence.' Eoreign navies were represented by the Turkish cruiser 44 Zahaif 'and the German gunboat ' Cormoran.' In the month of January of the present year, the Messageries Maritimes Company having decided to send a vessel to the Persian Gulf in connection with their line to Bombay, the Company's S.S. 44 Alphee' commenced calling at Maskat.RESIDENCY AND MASKA.T POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1895-96. 15 Official changes. —Major J.

Beport on the trade and commerce of the consular district of Bushire for the year 1895. \Jt The year 1895 unfortunately lias not continued the improvement in trade which was begun in 1894, there being a falling off in imports of over 24 and in exports of over 6 lakhs of rupees. The chief causes of this falling off were the depreciation of the kran (during the greater part of the year) both in relation to the pound sterling and to the rupee, large accumulations of stock of the previous year which failed to go off, locusts, high rates of transport, the general poverty throughout the Shiraz district caused by repeated bad years, and in the case of some exports, the fall in market prices. Amono- the imports an increase is shown in the case of arms and ammuni tion candles, cotton goods, iron and kerosine-oil and a decrease in glassware, gold' lace, indigo, copper, chinaware, sugar, tea, and woollen goods. In exports there is an increase in the case of dates, almonds, wheat, rose- water, shells, tobacco and carpets, and a decrease in horses, arms, cotton, gum, hides and skins, opium, silk, and wool. Details in each case are given below. Durino- the year the Clan line of steamers discontinued running and two new lines commenced— the British and Colonial and the Messageries Maritimes. This latter line, which is Erench, is running entirely under orders of the French Gov- renment and the company are not even attempting, seemingly, to make it pay commercially. Freights have not been affected and continued steady throughout the year ranging from 225. Qd. to 21s. A feature in the freight market was the change of the tonnage scale for bagged wheat, from 20 cwt. to 18 cwt. per ton. 0 A German firm, Job Werth &amp; Co., tried to start business in Bushire, but their methods seems not to have recommended themselves to the Persians and their venture has resulted in the bankruptcy of the firm and a strong prejudice against Germans among the Persian merchants here. Though 1895 cannot be considered even a fairly good year the prospects of 1896 are verv much worse, and there seems every likelihood of its being one of the worst years on record. It opened badly and continued worse and most of the firms here tell me that there is nearly literally nothing doing. Imports. Arms and aTheoretically this trade is prohibited by the Per sian Government, but like all similar prohibitions in Persia, this practically only substitutes an arbitrary impost for a fixed duty, and the large increase m the yalues shown are mainly due to higher yaluation caused by the raising ot this import by the local authorities, though there was also a slightly increased demand in Dashti and Dashtistan. Candtes.—Theve was a greater'demand for candles in Shiraz and Ispahan and the imports consequently slightly increased. Pnffon /mods —In spit© of a certain amount of accumulation at the end of las ty ear owing to dearness of transport, the low prices in Manchester led to lar-e imports of cotton goods during the year, and the large advance recorded last year has been still further increased this year by oyer 7 lakhs of rupees. Covver and iron.— Owing to the scarcity in Shiraz and dear exchange the imports of copper fell ofi by 3J lakhs of rupees, hut iron showed a small ^ainaware.—Tbemarket was dull and the imports fell off by rather more than f of a lakh.a#' il Jl: -r i- 18 administration report on the persian gulf political Glass and glassware. —Prices fell in Shiraz and Ispahan and caused a decrease of J lakh. Gold lace and gold thread. —Importers have been importing inferior qualities, and prices have accordingly fallen, which accounts lor the slight fall ing off in these articles. Indigo. —The depreciation of the kran affected this article and caused a decrease of over 2j lakhs. Kerosine-oil. —There was an increased demand for this article and also a rise in prices which resulted in a slight increase. Sugar, loaf and soft. —There has been a falling off of 2J lakhs in the case of loaf and also in that of moist sugar, the causes being the depreciation of the kran and a rise in prices in Europe. Tea. —The strong demand which there was last year was not kept up, chiefly owing to the deprecition of the kran and the year shows a decrease of J lakb. Thread and twist. —Cheap prices in Manchester caused a small increased importation. IVoollen goods. —Dearness of exchange caused a falling off of over 1J lakhs in the imports of this material. Exports. Horses. —Owing to the larger exportation of horses from Busrah and less demand for Persians in the Bombay market not so many horses were shipped this year as last. Arms and ammunition. —These are really only transhipped in Bushire, but are usually kept a short time before reshipping owing to restrictions on account of the nominal embargo on guns ; these restrictions were slightly increased and more arms imported direct to Maskat and the other markets on the Arab coast usually fed from Bushire so that business fell off 89,000= rupees. Cotton. —The locusts again ravaged this crop which had besides been kept small from fear of thier re appearence, so that the decrease of over 1J lakhs is not surprising. Dates.—- A m increase of a few thousand rupees occurred in the export of dates, the increased demand being in the Indian market. Almonds.—In this article also the Indian market showed an increased demand and nearly one lakh's worth more than last year were exported. Wheat. —In spite of embargoes the export of wheat made a further ad vance of 8J lakhs owing chiefly to the greater demand in England and partly to some of the stocks which usually go to Busrah being diverted to Bushire by the better prices ruling there. Gum. —Large exports were made last year on an already glutted market, so that this year the demand was very small and a decrease of nearly f lakh is easily accounted for. Hides and shins. —The market in these articles, too, was much overstocked, and the exports this year consequently show an appreciable falling off of 78,000 rupees. Opium. —Prices in China were bad, which added to the depreciation of the kran, caused a heavy fall of 12 J lakhs in the amount exported during 1895. An increased demand in India caused a slightly increased exportation. Shells.- —Next to none having been exported last year, European market recovered itself and exporters got rid of rather more than a lakh's worth more than last year. b 1eesidbnct and maskat political agency for the yeah 1895-96. 19 Silk. —Poor markets in India caused a small falling off of some 3,000 rupees. Tobacco shows an increased export of over two lakhs worth, but this really represents the accumulated stocks of three years, which were shut up owing to the opposition of the mullahs to the Societe du Tombac referred to in the previous year's report. This opposition was broken down towards the end of last year and the societe were able to buy freely with the above result. Wool —The bad prices realised in 1894 and a scarcity of the article caused by reckless waste of ewes killed to procure astrachan caused a falling off of 1,19,000 rupees. Carpets. —The Syrian market showed an enormously increased demand which led to an increased exportation to the extent of over 5 lakhs. Miscellaneous. Exchange was bad throughout the year. It opened at 57i krans per found sterling and fell to 53 krans in the middle of the year and closed at 53^- krans. It was lightest in Eebruary at 58J krans and lowest in November at 52 krans. Mule-hire at the commencement of the year was 200 krans per 100 mans (775 lb), but fell in March to 80 krans and again rose in April to 115 krans, closing at the end of the year at 75 krans. Freights remained steady throughout the year, varying only from 21s. to 22s. Qd. During the year shipowners changed the tonnage rate of bagged wheat from 20 cwt. to 18 cwt. per ton. The tl Clan line' which started running in 1894 discontinued doing so, but two new lines—' the British and Colonial' and the 'Messageries Maritimes '— commenced to run. The tc Messageries Maritimes ' only run one boat which they put on the run against their own will at the orders of their Government, and they do not seem to be anxious or likely to cause much competition against the older lines.

Trade. The returns of trade of Maskat cannot be considered strictly accurate, as the figures given are those obtained from the customs farmer and which are impossible of proper check. The total trade of the year is estimated at $3,708,210 against $3,708,180 for the preceding year. If specie be deducted from the totals the trade of Maskat for 1895-96 shows an increase of $135,030 as compared with the previous year. Excluding specie exports show an increase of $215,870. The chief increase in imports is shown as due to goods arriving from Europe and also, but in a less degree, from India and the Persian Gulf. A comparison of the imports and exports will show that local consumption does not claim the whole of the imports, but that Maskat still retains a posi tion as a port of entry and distribution for the Oman and Pirate Coasts. This however is in a much less degree than in past years when the fact that mail and other steamers did not make many places in the Persian Gulf regular ports of call, naturally tended to make Maskat a larger distributing centre than is now the case. Under the head of exports, of items which show an increase as compared with the previous year, cotton fabrics account for $70,000. This was due to the increased demand in the African Coast and in Madagascar for cloth of local manufacture. This increased demand for cloths of local manufacture also accounts for the increased importation of twist from India. Pates account for $60,000 due to the restoration of peace and the resump tion of trade with the interior. As regards imports rifles and ammunition imported show a very larsre increase during the year under report and account for about 53 per cent, of the total increase of trade during the past year. Owing to the prohibition of the import of arms into Persia, arms are imported into Maskat, and though large quantities are distributed in Oman and the Pirate Coast, a very laige pioportion are said to find their way into Persia in native craft. Cotton stuffs from India show an increase of $10,000 as compared with the previous year. This is said to be in a great part due to the fact that in the previous year, the rebels when in occupation of Maskat, looted most of the shops of the cloth -merchants, and hence a demand was created in this manner, and was further increased owing to the restoration of peace in Oman during the year under report, and the resumption of trade with the interior which had ceased for some months during the previous \ ear. Persian wheat having been cheap, a large demand arose for this article, whicb to a certain extent took the place of rice, the price of which was higher than in previous year. Chief amongst the articles which show a decrease as compared with P^vious years are pearls, due to the fact that steamers calling regularly at Bahrain take the pearls from there instead of from Maskat. Since Bahrain has become the centre of the Gulf pearl-trade, Maskat trade in this article may be said to have practically died out. E. G.

Report on the trade and commerce of Mohammerah for the year 1895. ABSTRACT OP CONTENTS Geneeal. Expohts. Imports. Shipping. Agricultuke. Population. Postal Service. Bundar Nasri. Tables. General. There lias been a general increase in trade, the total both of exports and imports exceeding: that of any previous year, and this would have been greater had it not been for the embargo on grain during the latter half of the year, owing to which there was a scarcity of cash among the populace. Exchange. —Exchange has been calculated at the rate of 55 krans to the pound sterling. Exports. Wheat—The- wheat exports were large ; but chiefly by direct steamer to London, and were entirely of the crop of 1894, as an embargo was placed on the shipment of wheat as soon as the old crop was exhausted. Some wheat was also sent to Basrah for sale of winch no returns are available. Natural products. Gum. —Increase in exports of natural products is due to nonshipment last year ; but in the case of gum there was this year a demand for it at Bundar Nasri for shipment to London direct, which has not been pre viously done, consequently gum which in other years would have been taken to the coast was brought to that place. Imports. The increase in imports is partly due to goods for Koweit in 1 uikish Arabia especially coffee from India and Aden, and rice having again been landed here. Cotton goods. —There was a marked increase in cotton goods especially by- steamer direct from Manchester and in American piecegoods from Aden, ihe shoopkeepers who were formerly supplied with chintzes from Basrah are now supplied by an importer here, and the only goods from Basrah were about 4,000 pieces Syrian silk, and about 15,000 pieces Syrian cotton goods. Twist. —The twist imported is chiefly for Shuster, where it is woven into cloth, which is afterwards printed and sold and exported in the form of quilt covers. The woof of the carpets made in Shushter is also ot this cotton twist, the warp being wool. Prices. The prices of cotton goods was about the same as given last year. There was a great decrease in the price of pepper, dependent on the Bombay market. Shipping. S ecL fourteen steamers called from Europe direct with cargo and seven called for cargo. Owing to the embargo on grain, there was little cargo shipped after June. Freight. Freight to London averaged about £1-2-6 per ton ; but in future 18 cwt. of wheat is to count as a ton. Freight to Bombay varied from 3 to shillings per ton.7G administration eeport on the persian gulf political The British India, and Bombay and Persia, Steam Navigation Company's steamers called regularly from and to Bombay, the former weekly and the latter about once in three weeks. The table attached ^ives all steamers but only sailing vessels under the British flag. Fewer Indian sailing vessels called during the date season, owino to the unsafe condition of the mouth of the river from piracies. Karun river. —The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company con tinued to run fortnightly to Bunder Nasri, in connection with a steamer to Shus- ter. Early in the vear a native companv comp.uij. the Shah-in-shahi, was formed and hired a steamer, which also runs fortnightly to Bundar Nasri ; since the ]3th April they have carried nearly all the local cargo and since the 16th July nearly all the through cargo from Bombay to Shushter, only returns of the through cargo are obtainable by these steamers. Freight. —Ereight to Shushter 175. 5jc/. per ton and to Bundar Nasri 95. per ton. In September the British Company reduced their rates to lis. Id. to Shushter and 5s. to Bundar Nasri. A griculture. Wheat. —The wheat crop was partial, early sowings turned out unusually well ; but the later sowings partially failed owing to want of rain. Owing to the larger area cultivated the total crop was above the average; but less than in 1894. Prices, 29. od. to 49. 8c/. per cwt. Prices rose at the beginning of the year owing to increased competition. The prospects for next harvest are ixood, the rains having been good ; if there is rain after the equinox an unusually good crop may be expected, other wise an average one. Dates. —The date crop was below average owing to excessive crops in pre ceding years impairing strength of the trees. Price was about 3s. Qd perlGO pounds. P opulation. The population of Mohammerah is now about 5,600 ; there was again some immigration from Turkish Arabia and also from the province of Ears, where there was some scarcity. Health. —In August there was an epidemic of influenza, but no deaths occurred. Cattle f/^r/s^.—Since the end of July there has been much mortality among cattle owing to an epidemic. Postal S ervice. The Persian Post Office at Mohammerah was reopened at the end of July and a weekly service to Shushter and the interior instituted. This route is practically useless for correspondence with Great Britain, being liable to great delays, which are avoided by using the Bombay route, there being a weekly mail service from that port. Bundar Nasri. Building is still going on at Bundar Nasri ; but trade there was affected by the embargo on grain. Disful cargo. —The Shah-in-shahi company is making arrangements to build a store at Bundar Aminiah, opposite Bundar Nasri, and to land and ship cargo for and from Dizful there in connection with caravans, which formerly came to Mohammerah, some cargo is already going by this route, which appears to have many advantages over that by Shushter.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000358.0x0002cb_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/V/23/69, No 338</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000358.0x0002cb</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/V/23/69, No 338</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘Administration Report on the Persian Gulf Political Residency and Maskat Political Agency for 1895-96’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1896/1896</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-31T02:23:24</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (43 folios)</extent><extent>The report is arranged into a number of sections and subsections, with statistic data in tabular format directly following written sections.
