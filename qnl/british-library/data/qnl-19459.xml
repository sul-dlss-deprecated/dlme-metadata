Anderson encloses a disposition with his letter, entitled “The Information of Oosman Moossa, inhabitant of Bombay” (folios 67-70), dated 15 April 1856. The text is a testimony by the owner of the vessel in question, in which he describes the attack upon the boat by 1,500 Wahhābīs at Sharjah, his meeting with the Native Agent at Sharjah, Hajee Jacoob [Hajjī Yaqoob], and his return to Bombay.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024066926.0x000016#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
