The enclosed letter is letter no.437 of 1854 (folio 323) from Captain Sir Henry Leeke, Commodore and Commander in Chief of the Indian Navy, to the Honourable Lord Elphinstone, Governor and President in Council at Bombay, dated 6 June 1854. Leekeâ€™s letter is a response to proposals for the suppression of the slave trade by the Officiating Political Agent at Aden, Brigadier Clarke (folios 317-21). In his response Leeke states that he can offer no further suggestions for measures toward the suppression of the slave trade, beyond reiterating that he does not have the means with which to strengthen the naval squadrons either at Aden or in the Persian Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000053#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
