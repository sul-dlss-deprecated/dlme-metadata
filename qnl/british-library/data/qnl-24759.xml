Imperial Military Geography. By J. Fitzgeral© Lee. (Clowes. I2s.6d.net.', The previous edition of this book, pub lished in 1908, contained forecasts, based upon considerations of military geography, of some of the most important operations of the Great War which proved to be so accurate as to cause some readers to imagine that the book had been issued after the events. Many of these passages have been preserved in the present edition, but othenvise the book has been re-written in the light of the Peace Treaties. Nor does the author confine him self to what might be termed the dry bones of the subject—-geography often contents itself with defining the “ where ” of a place, the military geographer goes further and sometimes assigns the “ wherefore ” as well. We find, too, that he sometimes steps aside to point a moral or explain a situation. Thus we are warned of the effect of the slaughter of white men during the war upon the balance of power as between the now dominant white and his coloured subjects and neighbours; or we learn how the commercial development of Aden has been arrested, partly by its unhappy political status as the Cinderella of India, partly owing to Lord Morley's action in listening to the interested advice of a small clique of local merchants. Sometimes thei author rather lets his feelings run away with him, but these digressions only serve to season an otherwise carefully prepared dish. ; There are, however, one or two slips. Others of the new Baltic States besides Finland have a distinct nationality, and language, of their own ; Tabriz is not, and has not been, the capital of the Republic ot Azerbaijan, but is still that of the Persian province of Azerbaijan ; it was Nasr ed Din Shah, and not his son Muzaffar-ed-Din Shah, who was assassinated in 1896 ; and the experiences of the late war tend to modify the statement made on page 9 about the swamp defences of the coast of what used to bo Turkey in Europe. iIThe Unde In on this N( and ad * but to-1 4 In any further communication on this subject, please quote No - ‘ 124284/a'.h./44a. and address, p not to any person by name, but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” © f i^d?

EXTRACT FROM PRIVATE LETTER FROM LORD 'CHELMSFORD TO MR.CHAMBERLAIN Dated 25th August 191.6. O The General Staff have asked for an extension of the present line for three miles up to the position we now occupy and have requested that it should be open for traffic by November 1st, The necessary material was sent off from India on August 13th and there should therefore be no difficulty in carrying out the work in time. The railway Board have further engaged to supply material for the extension of the railway up to and beyond Lahej. Maclean, who built the existing line, has been recalled from Mesopotamia. He will first collect necessary material and pergpanc.1 in India and then supervise the actual construction work of the line. It is estimated that when work begins the line can be laid in three weeks to Lahej and in three weeks from Lahej to El Anad. There is no difficulty about the material, as the line is metre gauge.700 O 090 [ ~ r&gt; ' T ur. THE ADEN HINTERLAND. Lord LA.MINGTON had the following Notice on the Paper—“ To ask the Secre tary of State for India what are the reasons that determine the policy of His Majesty’s Government to prevent railway construc tion in the Aden Hinterland.' The noble Lord said: When I recently asked a Q uestion bearing on this subject the noble Viscount could not on that occasion be in his place. I was not given any explanation why the Government adopted such a non possumus action in regard to this matter. Perhaps the noble Viscount will be able to give me some reason now. The LORD PRESIDENT of the COUNCIL (Viscount Morley) : My Lords, I am afraid I cannot add anything in substance to what has already been said on this subject by my noble friend behind me. I quite understand the interest that Lord Lamington takes in this matter. He and I were concerned at the same time in Indian administration. But I do rather wonder that he should think it necessary to raise the question in the form he does, because he is really well aware—nobody in England is better aware than he is—of the line of policy which, wisely or unwisely, His Majesty’s Government determined to adopt at the time when Lord Lamington was Governor of Bombay. That policy has up to this point worked most successfully. I am not sure that we were fortunate enough to have the approval of the noble Lord, but he will be glad to know that in our view and in the view of the Government of India to-day—though perhaps less so at the time—and in the opinion of my noble friend Lord Crewe, that policy has thoroughly j ustified itself. It is part of that policy, as the noble Lord well knows, that we should avoid entangling ourselves in any responsibility in that wild region the Hinterland of Aden. That was the old policy. Then, for good reasons or bad, the Government of which Lord Curzon was at the head in India took another view. Then we reverted to the older view; and it was part of that policy that we should not entangle ourselves in any responsibility by anything like railway construction, nor should we encourage other people to entangle themselves, and us consequen tially, in any such responsibilities. I do not believe that I can add anything to the general line of argument with which my W'rVcJL r 1911 ] The Aden Hinterland noble friend is thoroughly familiar. It is true that the Turkish authorities are encouraging surveys in their own terri tories—that is to say, in the territory north of the line which was drawn and accepted at the time when my noble friend was Governor of Bombay ; but that is no reason at all for our encouraging British subjects or any others in making lines to meet the Turkish line if it is ever constructed. So long as the Turkish line does not violate the line of demarcation settled at the time I am referring to, it cannot be to our interests to permit those for whom we should be ultimately responsible to embark in railway construction. The noble Lord asks for reasons. Those are the reasons. They are plain, and they lie on the surface of the policy which has been adopted, and we see no reason whatever to go back upon them. Lord LAMINGTON : I wish to thank t he noble Viscount for his courteous reply. Though I was aware that those circum stances then dictated his policy, still I maintain that the Government cannot for ever take up a dog-in-the-manger attitude and say, “ We are not going to do anything ourselves and we are not going to let any body else do anything.” You cannot suppose that you are for ever to prevent a district over which you have assumed some responsibility being opened up and developed in a way in keeping with ordinary civilisation. I believe there have been railway projects put before the Government of India or the Government of Bombay for the purpose of opening up the Aden Hinterland. The responsibility to be assumed by His Majesty’s Government would not be pecuniary. It would only be, I presume, in the keeping of good order. I think the noble Viscount exaggerates the character of any disorder that is likely to take place in the Aden Hinterland. The people there are not warlike. Their actual warfare consists of a few r people out of each village getting behind rocks and trees and taking pot-shots at their opponents. Possi bly a few people are killed, but after a week or two of these operations the war is over. I submit that we cannot for ever assume this non possumus attitude of not allowing the country to be developed by other people. The Government, as I say, would incur no responsibility except that of keeping order, which is a risk of the most remote kind.- {' ) THE ADEN HINTERLAND. Lord LAMINGTON rose to ask the Secretary of State for India whether he could give any information about the railway to be constructed by a French syndicate, from Hodeida to Sana’a, and whether all idea of railway extension in the Aden Hinterland had been abandoned ; also whether he could state what progress had been made in the dredging of Aden Harbour. The noble Lord said : My Lords, I regret that slight indisposition prevents the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, being present this afternoon to answer these Questions. It was his policy when Secretary of State for India which had some bearing on one of the Questions I have put down. Some eight or nine years ago, after the conclusion of certain operations in the Aden Hinterland, the Government had under consideration a project for the construction of a railway from Aden to the high ground in the Hinterland to a place called Dthala. This was under consideration with the object of helping to pacify and bring into good order the Aden Hinterland, and also as affording a place where a sanatorium could be formed at which the troops in Aden could find refuge from its scorching rocks. But the policy of the noble Viscount was to withdraw altogether from the 'interland and to have as little interference as possible on our part with anything that went on in that country. Therefore any considera tion of a railway lapsed. At the same time the Chief of Lahej had granted one or more concessions for a railway to a company who wished to construct what would have been a portion of the bigger scheme—from our Aden frontier at Shaikh Othman to his capital—but even this railway was pro hibited as coming under the grounds for , withdrawal which the noble Viscount con sidered expedient to adopt. This always j seemed rather a selfish policy on our part, that because it did not happen to suit our policy we should prevent one of the Chiefs under our suzerainty opening up his country. But it was obvious that if the railway was not carried on to Aden it would be of no value at all. A few days ago I saw in the Press a state ment that a railway syndicate was beginning to construct a line from Hodeida to Sana’a, which is 140 miles inland and is the capital of Yemen. If it is the fact that there is now going to be a development of the southern portion of Arabia, I would ask whether it would not be advisable to recon sider the policy which was adopted by the noble Viscount and allow the development of the Aden Hinterland by the great civilis ing agency of a railway. Probably there is more reason for doing so because of the scheme for deepening and improving the inner and outer harbours of Aden itself. This is with the idea of attracting trade particularly from East Africa, but there has always been a strong desire on the part of the inhabitants of Aden to promote the trade of the place by having better inter course with the Hinterland. I am well aware that our first consideration is of Aden as a strategical position, and that from time to time the view of the Admiralty has altered as regards its value in this respect. That being so, it was not unnatural if the Government have been reluctant to en courage Aden to become a commercial entrepot and so increase their responsibilities for defence. On the other hand, if in response to local demands an improv ement in the port is being carried out it is incon- &gt; y.1005 sistent and unfair should we disallow what is the counterpart of harbour accommoda tion—namely, the opening up of the country by a railway if there is any private agency anxious to undertake the project, as certainly there was in the past. This is „ -civ for asking for information as to what is our position at the present time, and what is the attitude of the Government towards the whole question of the develop ment of the Hinterland and of Aden becom ing an important trading centre. Earl BEAUCHAMP: My Lords, in the absence of my noble friend the Leader of the House I have been asked to reply to the noble Lord’s Questions. In regard to the first, the answer is that a concession to survey a projected line from Hodeida to Sana’a was obtained in 1909 by M. David Leon, of Paris, from the Ottoman Minister of Public Works, and the survey was completed in April, 1910, by French and Italian engineers. The scheme in cluded the construction of a harbour at Ras-el-Ketib and a railway line from Ras-el-Ketib via Hodeida to Mefak (186 kilometres) and thence to Sana’a (85 kilo metres), a branch to be added proceeding north-west to Amran (57 kilometres from Sana’a). The total cost of the scheme was estimated at £1,772,000. It is under stood that the Ottoman Government has decided not to grant a concession to any foreign company for the proposed line for a limited number of years, but M. David Leon’s syndicate has taken in hand on behalf of the Ottoman Government the construction of the harbour at Ras-el- Ketib and the section of the railway from that place to Hujjula which it has been decided to construct. The line will run via Hodeida (about 116 kilometres). No decision has yet been taken at Constan tinople with regard to the continuation of the line to Sana’a. M. David Leon has also obtained the concession to make a survey of the country between Hodeida and Taiz and between Taiz and Sana’a, with a view to ascertaining the prac ticability of a line traversing these parts to Sana’a. The Aden Hinterland. 1006 As to the second Question in regard to railway extension in the Aden Hinterland, it is the settled policy of His Majesty’s Government to abstain from any extension of their responsibilities in the Aden Hinter land so long as the status quo is strictly observed by the Turkish Government. Any scheme for railway construction would be narrowly scrutinised by them in the light of this policy. The reply to the third Question is that the dredging of Aden Harbour, which early last year was reported to be nearing completion, has been some what prolonged owing to physical obstacles necessitating a modification of the scheme. It may interest the noble Lord to know what those obstacles are. The latest information we have is a report made by the Port Trust to the Bombay Government in 1910, in which they state that difficulties had been experienced in attempting to remove the rock in the valley mouth on the south side of the channel, and that the dredger had broken down. It was therefore decided to abandon dredging in this particular spot, and to widen the other part of the channel. This alteration in the scheme was approved by the port engineer and the Port Trust, and was sanctioned by the Bombay Government. Lord LAMINGTON: I am much obliged to the noble Earl for his answer. At the same time I would ask His Majesty’s Government whether it is right, not that they as a Government should embark in any enterprise, but that they should prohibit private agencies from developing a country for which, after all, we are responsible. It certainly seems to me rather a dog-in-the-manger policy that we should undertake more or less to supervise and see that good order is maintained in a certain area, and vat the same time not allow the Chief to contract an obligation with private parties for a project which would have a beneficial effect upon the whole of that country. House adjourned at a quarter before Seven o’clock, till To-morrow, a quarter past Four o’clock. The Aden Hinterland.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 45 of the 17th January, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s vice-consul at Hodeidah reporting the commencement by a French syndicate of operations on the proposed Hodeidah- Sana’a Railway. I |l Q \rp* GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Vice-Consul Richardson to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 14 E.) Sir, Hodeidah, March 2, 1911. I HAVE the honour to refer to my despatch No. 22 E. of the 20th June last, furnishing information on the Hodeidah-Sana’a Railway scheme. On the 15th ultimo a party of fourteen engineers, French and Italian, arrived here to commence operations. I understand that the Ottoman Government has decided not to grant a concession to any foreign company for the proposed railway for a limited number of years. It would appear, however, that the Ottoman Ministry of Public Works at Constantinople have arranged with a French syndicate headed by David Leon Bey, of Paris, referred to in my above-quoted despatch of last year, to take in hand immediately on behalf of the Government the work of construction of the proposed harbour at Ras-el-Ketib, and the section of the railway between the latter place and Hujjeila, which it has been definitely decided to construct. The above-mentioned syndicate will be reimbursed for its trouble and expense at the rate of £ T. 4,000 per kilom. This will include the cost of the harbour at Ras-el- Ketib, and the necessary buildings there and along the railway line. According to the trace, the section of the railway between Ras-el-Ketib and Hujjeila, via Hodeidah, is about 116 kilom. I infer that the Ottoman Ministry of Public Works have reserved to themselves the right of taking over the work of construction of the railway at any time they may choose. No decision has been taken at Constantinople so far with regard to the continuation of the railway line to Sana’a. The original scheme in which the railway was to have traversed the Wadi Sanfur to Mefak and thence via the Wadi Fersh to Sana’a, and for which a survey was made by the same French contractors last year, has now been abandoned as impracticable and too expensive. A contract has for the present been made with David Leon Bey for a survey of the country between Hqdeidah and Taiz, via Beit-el-Fakih, Zebeed, and Hais, and between Taiz and Sana’a, wuth a view to ascertain the practicability and utility of a railway line traversing these parts to Sana’a. A party of French engineers will leave to-morrow afternoon for Beit-el-Fakih to survey the country and study the question of a railway in that direction. This morning General Izzat Pasha, chief of the general stafi in Turkey and appointed special commissioner and commander-in-chief of the Ottoman forces in the Yemen, cut the first sod of the railway at the site outside the town where it is proposed to build the Hodeidah railway station. [1972 c—3]A number of Ottoman officials, civil and military, the foreign consular corps, the local mercantile community, and a number of Arab sheikhs and seyyids were present at the ceremony. 1 learn from the chief engineer in charge of the construction of the railway that the section to Hujjeila and the harbour at Ras-el-Ketib will be completed within the - * course of the next eighteen months.

I learn from my French colleague here that the construction of the Hodeidah- Sana’a line is not likely to he commenced for about another year, if ever, there being a hitch at Constantinople in the negotiations between the French syndicate which has made the survey and the Ottoman Government. I did not clearly understand from him the nature of the hitch, but he spoke of the Ottoman Government now inviting or being about to invite tenders for the construction. Dr. Richardson writes to me under date the 17th December, 1910, that the engineers who were to have arrived at Hodeidah at the end of last October to proceed with the construction of the line had not yet arrived, and that it was not known w'hen they would arrive. He writes further, under the same date, that some hitch appears to have occurred in the negotiations at Constantinople since the recent failure of the Ottoman Government to raise the well-knowm loan in Paris, and that he hears incidentally that German and British syndicates respectively have entered the field of competition, and have submitted tenders on more favourable terms, the French tender being unacceptable as regards both cost of construction and kilometric guarantee, but that his French colleague at Hodeidah thinks the work of construction will soon be taken in hand and the concession secured by the F rench syndicate.

Prom - Brigadier-General J. A. Bell, Acting Political Resident, Aden, To — The Secretary to Government, Political Department, Sombary. I have the honour to bring to the notice of Govern ment the subject-matter of an interview I lately gave to Sir Ahmed Padthl, the Abdali Sultan, when certain points of interest were elicited. 2. The Sultan ashed me earnestly to consider the condition of Amir Shaif of Dthala whose affairs are rapidly going from bad to worse. He enumerated the many advantages that had accrued to that Chief and to Government during our stay in the Hinterland, so that our present policy c£ prac tically abandoning the Amir was unintelligible not only tc the Abdali but to all the Hinterland people. Sir Ahmed advocated our step x ing in to rehabilitate the Amir,and said that our failure in this direction would result in the dis appearance of that Chief who was there to carry out certain wellwell-defined Treaty obligations both on the Turkish border and behind on the trade-routes passing through his te'-r'- tory. He states that our present policy will moreover result in a complete effacement of our prestige in that quarter and elsewhere, the effects of which would be far reaching. * :le ‘ ^ so on the necessity of a stronger and more pronounced policy along the Turkish border : that the iui^s openly derided British claims to suzerainty even in the 3 Cantons and had declared that the British were averse to personal intervention there in view to safeguarding the ic.. ii- simply because their hold on the country was purely nominal : that the liutassarif of Tais had lately told Sir | Ahmed on^i, it was idle to refer Turkish complaints against | Arabs on our side the oorder to the Aden Residency, as the latter exercised so little authoritv (sis). The Sultan 'J^ed the construction of a railway at first only to Lnhei, his capital, and trat this might hereafter be extended either towards Dthala or in the direction of Haushabi terri- tory. He Believed this Tas of primary importance. ^ told the Baltan he could discount all these idle reports of loss of prestige, which haxs were the outcome of meremere bravado. We held Aden and the Chiefs in the Hinter land were bound by Treaty to co-operate in re the safety of the trade routes for which they received stipends : that their interests necessitated their stirring themselves in the natter. 5. The \bdali reminded me of the annual disburse ments made qua 'Darbar ?r9sent3 t, and 'Entertainments’* in Aden, and asked if the results were in any way proportionate to the outlay made. I reminded Sir Ahmed again that he and others were bound by Treaty to safeguard their own terri- # tories and that the system of money doles was a matter that concerned ourselves alone. 6 . He dwelt on the chaos that prevails on these routes owing to the vagaries of such irresponsible tribes men as the Subehis, and others of the Hadfan tribes such as the Kotaibi, Ahl Abdillah, Bakri and Dthambari, all of whom took dues as seemed to them best. As to the Kotaibi- Alawi affair which has not progressed a step since our evacuation in 1CC7, the Sultan said he was immediately summoning the belligerents between whom he had concluded a one-year truce, but he was not over-sanguine as to the result. He asked what promises he might extend to the XotaibiKotaibi who wished for arms r -nd a stipend. I replied that obviously all defended on the agreement made between that Sheikh and the Alawi and that he 'the Sultan) was aware that the fulfilment of these desires had been made conditional u^on mutual understanding and reconciliation : that if the Abdali took up the matter in real earnest, the consummation was not likely to be long deferred. 7. I cannot too strongly urge upon Government the necessity of bloatering up Amir Shaif of Dthala. It is true that chaos reigns there. His feud with the Shairis and the Jabal-Jihafi clans has been resuscitated. Some of the Upper Yafai tribesmen who, I have reason to believe, were invited by the Amir to pull the chestnuts out of the fire by picking a quarrel with the Shairis in the matter of certain villages bordering on the Shairi and Muflahi (Upper Yafa) territories, recently invaded the Shairis, who defeated them and drove them back. This victory will, I fear, ewcite the Shairis still further to push their quarrel with the Amir, who, deserted even by his own subjects, is certain!' 1, now in a parlous condition. The personal disappearance of Amir Shaif is a mere bagatelle, but there is no successor strong enough to rehabilitate AmiriAmiri affairs and to keep order in that quarter whioh touches the Turldsh border. The Amir's isolation is yerv real ? -id calls for a more liberal display of co-operation from this Residency in the way r-? arms and awamition. It wonld, moreover, be well if the recalcitrant tribesmen in that quarter could view a more visible proof of our interest in upholding the authority of a ;aan whom we have entrusted with duties he cannot possibly perform without extraneous aid. Non-intervention spells indifference to the Arab mind and we lose caste politically not alone in Dthala but throughout our sphere of influence. I told the Abdali to discount Turkish opinion, but that opinion is based on very good ground, witness the un rest on the Subehi-Turkish border, in which matter the Abdali has been aske* 5 to use his good offices to mediate. S. If this letter is lacking in a full exposition of my views how best to remedy what is going on, I would say that I am confronted at the outset by the knowledge of the policy in vogue since our withdrawal in 1907 from the Dthala plateau. The first step would, I think, be to ccx.tenance railway enterprise.dm ■■I ' ( Copy ) SaCK.£T . From C. A.

The Governor in Council has, therefore, no reason to suppose that the circumstances now reported by Brigadier General Bell are at all likely to induce His Majesty^ Government to change the policy towards the Arab tribes laid down in the Secretary of State's Despatch No. 35-Secret dated the 5th October 1906. As the Government of India are aware on the recommendation of the Political Resident AdenPI Aden the Amir of DHhala has in the past been given arms for his protection and it appears to His Sxoellency the Governor that this is as much as oan he done without transgressing the policy approved by the Secretary of State. If, therefore, the Government of India agree this Government propose to draw the attention of the Political Resident, Aden, to the Despatch quoted above. They will also point out that the meaning of the phrase 'a more visible proof of our interest in upholding his authority” is far from clear and that armed assistance or intervention in any form in favour of the Amir or any other chief of the Hinterland is clearly opposed to the settled policy. They will add that, as in the past, Government are willing to consider favourably any recommendation to provide the Amir with arms and ammunition. As regards the question of railway extension in the Aden Hinterland, the Governor in Council proposes to refer the Political Resident to the Despatch from His Majesty 1 s Secretary of State JTo. 30-Secrot dated the 27th September 1907, and to paragraph 4 of Foreign Department letter Uo. 1661 I.B., dated the 19th August 1910, as showing the policy to be pursued in this respect. 4* In conclusion I am to observe that the British Government is intimately concerned with the preservation of peace in the immediate neighbourhood of Aden and to this end I am to express the hope of the Governor in Council that the Government of India may be moved to pass early orders on the measures proposed in Mr. Du3oulay f s letter Ho. 2939, dated the 12th May 19lD, for policing the trade routes leading to Aden.

In reply, I am to say that the Government of India approve of the reply which the Bombay Government propose to make to the Pesident. 3.

H. S. Clarke, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India,y°. cj. Con jldential. Railway, No. 52. India Office, London, 24th June 1910. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, I have considered in Council the letter of Your Excellency’s Steam tramway at Aden. Pro- Government, No. 6 Railway, of the posed concession to Messrs. Mena- 3rd February 1910, on the subject hem Messa for construction and of a proposal by Messrs. Menahem W01, mg - Messa for the construction and working of a 2 ft. G ins. gauge steam tramway at Aden from Tawahi to the Crater, with a branch to Sheikh Othman. 2.1 our Excellency remarks that, since the proposal is limited to British territory, it is essentially different from those which were dis cern aged in the past, and the report of the Railway Board is almost exclusively concerned with considerations of finance and construction as distinguished from questions of policy. But I observe that the pro moters frankly state that ” they “ had and still have hopes that at some “ future time you will consider it advantageous to extend the line beyond Sheikh Othman.” The connection between the reversion of our political relations at Aden to their former long-established position of a minimum of interference, and the extension of railway and other steam communication, to which I referred in my Secret Despatch No. 30, dated the 27th September 1907, must not be overlooked, and all schemes tending to closer communication with the protected territories must be examined m your Foreign Department, in order that their consequences from the political standpoint may be fully appreciated by me before any action is taken likely to give effect to them. 3. So far as the project is intended to connect Tawahi with the Crater, I have no objection to it, subject to the remarks which follow. But before deciding whether to agree to the extension to Sheikh Othman, I desire to be informed what proportion of the land imports and exports is likely to break bulk at Sheikh Othman and make use of this improved means of transport; and, if it is the case that the present population of Sheikh Othman is less than 7,000, I should wish to receive a full report both as to the expectation of remunerative passenger traffic, and as to the other purposes, “military, commercial, and sanitary,” which the tramway is expected to subserve, explaining why it is regarded as “ the “ only possible solution of the constant and ever-increasing difficulty of “ overcrowding in Aden.” 8526. I. 1123.4. In addition to this information I request that the engineering details of the scheme may be further examined, since I am advised that provision is made for a higher standard of construction than is needed for a short line ending at Sheikh Othman. As the object in view is confined to that of relieving Aden of its excessive population, and any future extension into the Hinterland would at once raise difficult political issues, the standard of expenditure should be rigorously adjusted to what is required for the single purpose stated. 5. It is not clear to me whether it is intended, in the event of a concession being granted, to form a Company to be domiciled in England with its capital in sterling. In this case it would be necessary for the promoters to obtain my approval to the charge to capital which it may be proposed to allow in respect of preliminary expenses. 6. But in all other respects it appears to me desirable that the negotiations with the promoters should be carried out locally, and, if an agreement is ultimately arrived at, that the requisite Tramway Order should be issued by the Government of Bombay. Such Order should, however, contain a clause reserving for settlement between the promoters and the Secretary of State the amount of the charge to capital in respect of preliminary expenses in the event of the capital being raised in sterling. 7. The only further observations I wish to make in regard to the proposed terms have reference to the proposals to grant the Company exclusive rights as carriers by railway and to protect them for 20 years from competition by public service mechanical road traction at equal or lower rates. It should, I think, be expressly provided by the Order that, in the event of the failure of the Company to carry out its functions as public carriers, these exclusive rights would terminate. Care should also be taken to express very clearly the nature of the protection against competition that is to be given, since the arrangement proposed is an unusual one, and it is most desirable that there shall be no possibility of its being interpreted in a wider sense than is intended. I notice that the arrangement proposed by the Political Resident at Aden in his letter of 24th April 1909 is not correctly summarised in the last sentence of paragraph 4 (vii) of the letter from the Bombay Government to the Railway Board, dated 28th August 1909. The enjoyment of this pro tection against the competition of public service mechanical road traction should be contingent, like the enjoyment of exclusive rights as railway carriers, on the proper discharge by the Company of its functions as carriers, and suitable provisions to this effect should be inserted in the Tramway Order.

Secret BO, dated September B7, 1907, which precluded the discussion even of any proposals for connecting any railway in ATbdali territory with the Port of Aden, and indicated the nature of the considerations which would be involved in any proposals for constructing railways even exclusively within that territory. The railway proposals were originally put forward as a part of the policy which led to the maintenance of a British garrison in the Dthali highlands. That policy was deliberately reconsidered by His Majesty's Government on military, financial and political grounds; and it was decided to revert to the status quo ante * when the British garrison ivas reduced to the absolute necessities of the fortified position at Aden, and the Hinter land was left alone save when, with the special sanction of Government, any temporari&gt; operations were required to Chech a Turkish advance, or for other good reasons.

To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. I have considered the Secret letter of Your Excellency’s construction in the Aden Hinterland. 2. The removal of the British garrison from Dthali, and the reversion materially affect the question of railway extension that it will be well to consider all previous proposals at an end and the correspondence closed. The matter can then be re-opened on a new basis if hereafter the Abdali Sultan should wish to construct an internal railway. In any case no proposals for extending an Abdali railway into the Aden settle ment or connecting it with its sea-board should be discussed with the Sultan without previous consultation with me. Apart from this, the construction of a line even exclusively within the Abdali territory would also require consideration in connection with any advances to be made by British subjects, and with questions of policy or of a military character on which the British Government, as the protecting power, has the right to be consulted. But it is not desirable to express any opinion on these matters unless or until the Sultan submits a definite scheme confined to his own territory, which can then be examined by me on its merits.

We would therefore enquire whether we are to allow the Sultan to take such measures as he may consider desirable, with a view to the construction of a line, and, if so, whether we should assist him with advice as to the best method of securing his object. We presume that, in any case, we should not take steps actively to prevent his making a line, and if it is to be made, we think that such advice as we can afford should be placed at his disposal.

I have recently received another letter from the Sultan from which it is evident that he is still most anxious for a railway to be constructed through his limits. And though he naturally desires to secure the utmost personal benefit from the undertaking, I have no doubt that, in his anxiety for the fulfilment of the enterprise during his life-time, he is prepared to give due weight to any advice that may be given to him regarding such modification of the original conditions as may be deemed necessary to render the undertaking more attractive to would-be promoters. 3.

The inference appears to me to he that, under present conditions, it will he wiser to do nothing in the direction of encouraging railway construction in Abdali territory or elsewhere in the Aden Hinterland. 4.

Tns Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLET, O.M., Hit Majesty'* Secretary of State for India. Fobt William, the 14th February 1907. Sib, In Mr. Brodrick’s Secret despatch No. 33, dated the 3rd November 1905, he requested that he might be furnished with a statement of the views of the Government of India on the whole question of railway construction in the Aden Hinterland before any steps were taken in connection with the offers that might have been received for the construction of the line. In your Secret despatch No. 35, dated the 5th October 1906, you have returned to the subject, and while requesting that no sort of permission or encouragement may be given to the extension of any line of railway into the British territory at Aden without your sanction, you have asked to be informed of the steps that have been taken by the Abdali Sultan of Lahej towards giving any concession for railway enterprise in his own territory. You desire to know what estimates have been framed of the cost of a railway in the Abdali territory and of its probable profits, if constructed. 2. From the correspondence, of which a copy is enclosed, it will be seen that in January 1905 Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw &amp; Bros, informed the Resident at Aden that they had obtained a concession from the Abdali Sultan of Lahej to construct a railway through his territory, and that they were anxious to obtain a further concession from the British Government for the extension of the line into British limits from Dar-al-Amir into Aden. The Resident at Aden in reporting on the matter to the Government of Bombay proposed very consider able alterations in the terms and conditions of the agreement between the Abdali Sultan and Messrs. Dinshaw, but the Government of India considered that before Messrs. Dinshaw’s offer was accepted at all it was advisable that an opportunity of submitting definite proposals should be offered to other ap plicants of good financial position who in the past had expressed their desire to open up railway communications with the Hinterland. The Abdali Sultan at first objected to this proposal, but in November 1905 he was induced to set aside the concession which he had granted to Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw &amp; Bros., and to agree to the publication of a draft notification prepared by the Political Resident explaining tue conditions under which offers might be made for the construction of the line by private ^enterprise. An examination of the draft notification showed that the conditions proposed provided generally for the interests of the British Government, and under certain circumstances for the interests of the Sultan, but that they offered little inducement to a promoter to apply for the concession. There was therefore the risk of friction between the Sultan and the concessionaires, and we were disposed to consider that, if the advantages of constructing the line were established, it might be preferable for us to make the line ourselves,\ i »6i ^ paying to the Sultan a royalty on net profits.

Enclosures of a letter to Eis Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, No. 23 , dated the 14th February 1907.No. 475, dated Aden Residency, the 29th January 1905. From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to inform you that on the 23rd instant I received a letter from Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers of that date, of which I enclose a copy, in which they informed me that they had obtained a concession from the Abdali Sultan for the construction of a railway within Abdali limits from Nohat Dakim to Dar-el-Amir, and applied to me for a concession to extend this proposed railway into British limits from Dar-el-Amir into Aden. I enclose true copies of English translations of the actual agreements which Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers have entered into with the Abdali Sultan, with which that firm has supplied me at my request. 2. This agreement was entered into without reference to me and apparently both parties to it were under the impression that ns the agreement was for the construction of a railway within ALdali limits, it did not concern Government and that therefore it was unnecessary to inform me. 3. I would here at once mention that Mr. Menahem Messa, another local apnlicant for the railway concession, has also lately approached the Abdali Sultan in this matter, and that he informed me a few days ago that the Sultan had offered to enter into an agreement with him too, and that it was only upon ^ his suggestion that the agreement should be made dependent upon the approval and sanction of Government that the Sultan had withheld his offer. Mr. \ Menahem Messa informed me that the Sultan repudiated the idea of such a . condition and expressed the opinion that Government had no concern with such a matter as the construction of a railway within his limits. 4. Upon my informing Mr. Hormusjee Cow^asjee Dinshaw of the attitude usually adopted by Government in regard to direct dealings between Native States and capitalists in India and in regard to negotiations on the subject of railway concessions he pleaded ignorance thereof, expressed regret for what he had done, urged that he was actuated by a strong desire h) benefit rather than to embarrass Government, and has expressed his willingness to cancel the agreement at once if so desired, in spite of the fact that he has actually deposited a sum of £2,000 with the Abdali Sultan by way of guaranteeing fulfilment of the agreement. 5. In reporting the matter for the information of Government, I have the honour to state that I have, for the present, refrained from addressing the Abdali Sultan in the matter and from asking him why he did not either inform or consult me before entering upon this important agreement. It is clear from the information given me by both Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers and Mr. Menahem Messa that the Sultan is of opinion that it was unnecessary to do so. 6. There is of course no question that the whole transaction now reported is opposed to Indian Bolitical Practice and that a similar occunencc taking place in India itself would call for stringent remark. But in view oi the fact that such a thing as a railway concession in the Aden hinterland is without precedent and in view of the consideration that the consent and goodwill ^of the Abdali Sultan and other neighbouring Chiefs may be held to be essential to the success of any railway undertaking in the hinterland, I would urge upon Government the desirability of taking a lenient view of the incident ana of doing all possible to foster the spirit of enterprise and interest just now displayed by the Abdali Sultan in the matter. 7. Erom your letter to my address, No. 7469, dated the 5th ultimo, and its accompaniments, I note that it is desired to defer consideration of this matter until the future administration of Aden shall have been decided. Ot the purport of this decision I personally infornaed Mr. Hormusjee some days before receipt of his letter now enclosed, but it is evident that the negotiations terminating with the agreement reported commenced some time before this and that owing to the Abdali Sultan pressing for an early settlement and also with 3903 F. D.^ - 1 a a view to gaining a priority of claim over Mr. Menahem Messa, his local competitor, Mr. Hormus.jee Cowasjee, brought these negotiations to the present conclusion in the hope that the concession now applied for might eventually fall into his hands and no other. 8. The opportunity presented by the situation thus created is in some ways peculiarly favourable for the undertaking, and I have therefore the honour o again recommend that the earliest possible consideration may be given to the question, the immediate importance of which to the future development or Aden cannot well be overestimated.

Praise be to God alone. We the undersigned Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw and partners who carry on trade in Aden under the name of Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers do solemnly affirm that we voluntarily agreed to conclude agreement No. Jj dated with His Highness the Sultan Ahmed Fadthl Mohsin of Lahej to construct a railway in his limit from Dar-el-Amir to the terminus of his frontier in direction of the Haushabi.

Thereafter they are entitled to the full amount of profit which they can receive every six months. No. 4. We undertake to Sultan Ali bin Ahmed Fadthl and his brothers to render him account showing the amount of profit half-yearly and that they can whenever they wish appoint some one they approve to see and examine the account etc. on their behalf. No. 5. We undertake to Sultan Ali bin Ahmed Fadthl and his brothers that should any loss occur in the work of the railway owing to any cause or we wish to abandon it for a commercial or whatever cause necessitating its abolish ing or stoppage before the liquidation of the amount we paid on account oftheir half share in the cost and expenses of the railway Sultan Ali bin Ahmed Fadthl and his brothers shall not be held responsible for the payment of the loss or the balance which may be still due on account of the money paid on their behalf as stated above.

Menahem Messa, To—M ajor-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden. We have the honour to apply to you for permission to construct a single tract portable railroad with steam power for the purpose of carrying freight and passengers to and from Steamer point, Maala and Sheikh Othman, and Aden Crater if practicable. We consider that such a railroad will aid much in the development of the trade of the settlement and be a means of developing Sheikh Othman in particular. We shall be glad to submit more details when advised that the scheme will be favourably considered. E Dated Aden, the 26th January 1905. From— Messrs. Menahem Messa, To —Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden. In December 1902 we had the honour to address General Maitland upon the subject of the construction of a railway hence to D’thala, but at that time Government were not ready to approve of the subject. Hoping that conditions will now permit, and that you may be disposed to favourably report upon our proposal to the Government, we submit the following:— We apply for permission to build a railroad hence to D’thala via Sheikh Othman, Lahej and Haushabi, the concession to have a term Of'not less than 70 years. The Sultan of Lahej have been good enough to express his approval of the building of a railroad through his territory.The only physical features that can be stated in advance of a final survey are that we propose a 24)' or 30' standard narrow gauge. We do not ask any financial help from Government whatever, and the fact of having a railway to the interior will facilitate the transport of troops and supplies and in addition will lead to the peaceful bearing of the tribes. The foregoing proposal we are of course prepared to amplify, under noti fication from Government of their being interested therein. Copies of our previous applications and the reply thereto are herewith forwarded for easy reference. Dated Aden, the 4th December 1902. From— Messrs. Menahem Messa, To—Brigadier-General P. J. Maitlod, C.B., Political Resident, Aden. We have tho honour to ask whether Government is prepared to grant a concession for the building of a railway from Aden into the interior up to the boundary between British and Turkish territory, adjacent to D’thala, and if so, we beg to he informed upon what terms the concession would be granted to us. We of course are prepared to give more details upon receipt of the advice that Government will look favourably upon the granting of a concession in this matter to private interests. Dated Aden, the 4th December 1902, From— Messrs. Menahem Messa, To— Brigadier-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident, Aden. We have the honour to request that you will be good enough to give us copies of the surveys and plans and any statistics and reports which the Government have had made and collected in connection with the proposed railway from Aden into the interior connecting with the Turkish Frontier at or about D’thala, as we wish to communicate the same to our friends in London for the purpose of enabling them to make an estimate in connection with the project under consideration. We hope that the Government will see their way to giving us the benefit of the work done by them in this direction that we may the sooner put a complete offer in your hands. No. 8, dated Aden, the 2nd January 1903. From— Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. Ashby, Political Agent and First Assistant to the Resident, To— Messrs. Mrnahem Messa. I am requested by General Maitland to inform you that^ he has received your letters re a railway into the interior of Arabia and to inform you that there are no surveys, plans, etc., and that no proposal for the construction of a railway is before Government. 2. Your application regarding a concession will be held over until his return, but as no proposal for construction of a railway is before Government, they would naturally not be prepared at present to consider any application for a concession.

Edgerlry, C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Govern ment of Bombay, Political Department, To—S, M. Fraser, Esq., C.I.E., Officiating 1 Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to invite a reference to the letter No. 475, dated 29th January 1905, addressed to the Bombay Government by the Political Resident, Aden [a copy of which has been forwarded direct to the Government of India by Major-General Mason), on the subject of the agreements entered into by Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers of Aden with the Abdali Sultan for the construction of a railway within Abdali limits from Nobat Dakim to Dar-el-Amir, and the request of that firm for a concession to extend the pro posed line of railway into Aden. A copy of my telegram, dated 9th February 1905, to the Political Resident and of his letter No. 1089, dated 26th idem, in reply thereto, is herewith enclosed, in order to place the Government of India in possession of the correspondence on the subject up to date. 2. I am to observe that, although the Bombay Government cannot recommend the above proposals in their present crude form, nor, consistently with past policy, recognise or support the agreements as they at present stand, His Excellency in Council considers that the scheme marks a most important stage in the progress of the question of railway development in the Aden Hinterland. Putting aside irregularities in procedure and the obvious objec tions inherent in the terms of the agreement, it is apparent that the Abdali Sultan, who is one of the most important of the Arab Chiefs and one with whom we have the closest relations, has entered upon an agreement with a private firm for the construction of a railway from one end of his territories to the other; that those territories come within a very few miles of Aden itself; that the problem of railway construction in the Protectorate is thus narrowed down very considerably ; and that, apart from the simple question of ways and means, the present incidents mark a great stride in advance in the direction of consolidating our political influence in the Protectorate. . 3. In regard to the terms of the draft as submitted, it is unnecessary, until the Governor-General in Council has come to a decision on the questionof policy, to say more than that in its present form, owing to the unfamiliarity of the parties concerned with Indian Political Practice, it is irregular and could not be accepted without material alteration. No arrangements will, of course, be proceeded with pending receipt of the orders of the Government of India, and I am only to remark generally that this Government would regard with favour a scheme for the construction of a line at all events as far as Nohat Dakim. - Telegram, dated the 9th February 1905. From—C. H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, ,• To— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Kesident, Aden. Your letter No. 475, dated the 29th January last. Please examine matter in light of treaties of 1843, 1844 and 1849 ; also in light of Government of India orders connected with mining and prospecting concessions passed in numerous cases ending with Kirkpatrick’s, and report by letter your opinion as to terms and conditions which should be. imposed on any agreement which could be recognised by Government. No. 1089, dated the 26th February 1905. From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—C. H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. ... In compliance with the request contained in your telegram dated the 9th instant, I have the honour to submit, for the consideration of Government, the following report concerning the railway agreement referred to in my letter No. 475, dated the 29th ultimo, and as to the terms and conditions which should, in my opinion, be imposed on any agreement which could be recognised by Government. 2. In regard to the attitude adopted in the matter by the Abdali Sultan in assuming that, as the proposed railway lies within his own limits, no reference to the British Government or to its representative in Aden is necessary, I have the honour to remark that this is not only opposed to Indian Political Practice in regard to both direct dealings between Native States and capitalists and also to negotiations on the subject of railway or mining or any other concessions, but that it is further clearly inconsistent with the actual Treaty relations into which the Abdali Sultan has entered with the British Govern ment. . . ; 3. In Article 9 of the Treaty executed in 1849, he has declared that in all things relating to the peace, progress and prosperity of Aden he will lend his utmost aid to support the intertests of the British, and that he will listen to and, impossible, attend to the advice of the British Government representative at Aden in all matters. And in his Treaty of 1867 he has already, in regard to both an aqueduct and a road leading from British limits into his territory, admitted certain principles and rights of intervention and control by Govern ment which must logically be held equally applicable to the case of a railway. . ^ 4. It does not seem open to question that such a thing as a railway which is projected to run from a point immediately adjacent to British limits into the Aden Hinterland is a thing which does closely concern the peace, progress and prosperity of Aden: and there does not therefore appear to be any room for hesitation in asserting that in point of fact the Abdali Sultan is bound to consult and to attend to the advice of the Political Resident at Aden in regard to such a project.10 5. In view of the consideration that his consent and good-will is most important to the success of the enterprise, it would appear politic to take as lenient a view as possible of his present attitude. At the same time it appears absolutely necessary to correct it. 6. In regard to the Parsi capitalist concerned, it seems sufficient to remark that it would not seem fair to allow him to gain any undue advantage over other competitors by his recent action; and that in view of the fact that his Jewish rival acting under my advice expressly refrained from entering into any agreement which was not made subject to the sanction and consent of Government, it seems only just that he too should be given an opportunity of tendering for any scheme that may eventually receive that sanction. This gentleman, Mr. Menahem Messa, is a capitalist of considerable substance and standing in South-Western Arabia. He is said to have more capital at his back than Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers. The name of Sassoon has been mentioned amongst his ether supporters. His family have been resident in this portion of Arabia for many generations, and his standing and position amongst the tribes of the hinterland is considerable. 7. In regard to the scheme as set forth in the agreement recently entered into between the Abdali Sultan and Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers, it appears to suffer from inherent defects which place it, as it stands, beyond the possibility of acceptance. 8. In order to secure the concession, the capitalist appears willing to make sacrifices which seem prejudicial to the success of the undertaking from a business point of view, whilst from a political point of view he takes it upon himself to guarantee the Sultan certain rights and privileges to which he is entitled by neither Treaty nor usage. 9. Special exception must be taken to the imposition of quit rent on land ^ i to be occupied by the railroad and stations, to the absence of any survey or plans or statistics of the actual project proposed, to the unwarrantable guarantee of rights of jurisdiction over British and foreign subjects, to the boycotof Jews and Europeans from the enterprise, and to the lack of any proper provision for preliminary inspection, accounts, returns, weights of loads, and reports of accidents, etc. 10. The mere fact of such an agreement having been drafted increases the difficulties of ultimately negotiating the enterprise ; and though Mr. Hormusjee Cowasjee may have been actuated by the best and most loyal of motives, there seems little doubt that his somewhat hasty conclusion of his own recent direct negotiations with the Sultan must not only lead to his own discomfiture, but is calculated to considerably add to the difficulties of carrying any railway scheme into the Aden Hinterland to a successful issue. 11. As to the terms and conditions which I think it necessary to impose upon any agreement which could be recognised by Government, I have the honour to suggest the following :— • (a) The project must be submitted in full detail to Government for approval and sanction. (b) Land should be granted free of charge for all purposes of the rail road, subject to compensation being paid for any actual loss sus tained and proved to the satisfaction of Government. (c) Jurisdiction over the line must be subject to Government supervi sion. Jurisdiction over all British subjects and over all European foreign subjects must be ceded to Government entirely. Juris diction over African or Asiatic foreign subjects may be exercised by the Court of the Abdali Sultan subject to the supervision of Government. (d) Materials required for construction of line, stations, etc., shall be free of taxation. (e) Similar personal privileges shall be extended to the Resident at Aden as to the Abdali Sultan.(/) No portion of the ^ line shall be opened to traffic of goods or passengers until it has been inspected and pronounced fit for such traffic by an officer appointed by Government. ( 0 ) The general principles of the Indian Railway Act shall be followed in regard to inspections, accounts, returns, weight of loads, and reports of accidents. {h) Proper arrangements for the protection of the line and of traffic and passengers shall be made and approved by Government. (£) The Government Postal Department shall be allowed to use the line on the terms in force in State railways in India. (j) No telegraph line or telephone shall be erected except with the sanction and subject to the control of Government. (k) All proprietors or shareholders in the railway shall be persons subject to or protected by the British Government. (1) The Abdali Sultan shall have a prior right to own shares in so much of the railway as lies within his own limits and shall he allowed to borrow capital for the purchase of such shares upon terms approved of by Government, (m) The Abdali Sultan shall at any time after the expiry of 70 years have a right to purchase so much of the line as lies within his limits. Government shall have the same right to purchase so much as lies within their limits. (n) None of the above conditions shall affect the Abdali Sultan’s present claim to transit dues which shall be collected at a special Customs House established for the purpose and managed by the Abdali Sultan’s own officials in accordance with the advice of Government. Government, however, is at liberty to make some arrangement with the Abdali Sultan to purchase or compound this claim hereafter. 12. I think that most of the above terms and conditions will be considered necessary by Government and that most of them called for no special remarks. Upon clauses (a), (6), (c), (d), (/),(#),(£), (i), (j), and (&amp;), I think that insistence will be considered necessary. 13. As to clause (c), the question of jurisdiction must of course be expected to present difficulties which it may not be easy to at once overcome. It would appear necessary to insist upon entire cession of jurisdiction over British and European foreign subjects, and to secure as far as possible Government supervision over all others. 14. Clause (e) I think politic and is in accordance with local usage and tradition. 15. As to clauses (l) and (n), I think that some concessions of the kind are advisable with a view to gaining the sympathy and interest of the Abdali Sultan in the undertaking. 16. As to clause (n), it is of course much to be desired in order to facilitate trade that the matter of transit dues should, if possible, be settled by com promise and that this troublesome imposition should thereafter cease. 17. The opportunity presented by negotiations to secure the above terms and conditions might perhaps be utilized with advantage to endeavour to arrive at a more satisfactory understanding on the subject of extradition of criminals. 18. Meanwhile I have the honour to recommend that the earliest possible consideration may be paid to the proposal to construct a railway from Aden to Sheikh Othman, and that I may be informed as soon as Government are inclined to view with favour any practicable scheme which may be put forward for the construction of that portion of railway. The actual con struction of such a li&amp;e would probably tend to facilitate negotiations for its extension into Abdali territory, and itself would tend largely to the material benefit of the settlement of Aden.12 No. 2609-E.B., dated Simla, the 8th July 1905. From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—The Hon'ble Mr. S. W. Edgerley, C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of the marginally * noted * Letter No. 475. dated the 29th January 1905, correspondence on the subject of agree- from the Resident «t Aden. ments entered into by Messrs. Cowasi’ee 26th Feljra * rl 19061 Dinshaw and Brothers of Aden with the Letter No. 2571, dated the 22nd April 1906* from Abdali Sultan for the Construction of a tbc Qovernment of Bombay. railwajr within Abdali JJ^g from Nobat Dakim to Dar-el-Amir, and the request of that firm for a concession to extend the proposed line into Aden. 2. In reply, I am to state that the Government of India are now prepared to consider favourably proposals for the construction of a railway by private enterprise from Aden into the interior, but before accepting the present offer from Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers, they would suggest, for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council, that an opportunity of submitting definite proposals should be offered to other applicants of good financial position who, in the past, have expressed their desire to open up railway communications with the Aden Hinterland. 3. It is observed that the Resident in his letter of the 26th February 1905 takes exception to certain points in the terms of the agreement with the Abdali Sultan for the construction of a line in his territory, and suggests the insertion of certain provisions to be framed on the lines customary in the case of an agreement for the construction of a railway in India and under Indian conditions. The circumstances at Aden, however* are so different from those in India that to insist on the application of Indian regulations would probably result in the indefinite postponement of the construction of any railway in the Aden Protectorate. 4. The only stipulations which, in the opinion of the Governnjent of India, should be insisted on are (а) The retention of jurisdiction by Government over Europeans and British subjects. (б) The right of the Government to use the railway for military pur poses, under conditions as regards rates and fares. (c) The right of Government to purchase the line in British territory, at not less than cost price, if it he desired to do so at any time. 5. It is further advisable that the plans and estimates for the portion within Government territory should be inspected by the Government of India before construction begins, and that that portion should be subject, as regards the transport of passengers, to such regulations as may be considered necessary. 6. On the question of gauge and standard there seems no necessity to express an opinion at present, but should the services of an experienced Rail way Engineer be desired by the firm which undertakes the project, the Govern ment of India would be prepared to depute an ofiBcer for the purpose. Extract paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 17, 19 to 21 of a note dated the 30th December 1905 by' Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident at Aden, on the future of Aden, Perm and the Einter land. * • ' * * * 8. The road from Labej up to Nobat Dakim lies close to the Tiban River and there should be no difficulty whatever in running the railway, for which proposals are now before Government, at a very low cost. Certainly not more&gt;1 t 13 than two nullahs have to be passed which would require bridges of any magni tude. For some distance to the westward, i.e., on the right bank of the Iiban, crops are to he seen ; on the left bank canals are being sparsely made and cultivation U commencing. This alone shows that much is to be done in the future in this direction, and the Arabs are beginning to appreciate it. 9. The proposition at present is for the railway to run to Nobat Dakim but there is little doubt that the Tiban Valley, right up to and beyond Musemir, is as fertile as it can be. From Musemir anyone proceeding through Ad Dareja towards Mavia is struck with the fertility of the district. Just beyond our border there are good springs in many places, where water is collected in canals and used extensively for irrigation. I have not been to this country myself, but Captain Sanders, my Deputy Assistant Adjutant General, who is a Royal Engineer officer, has lately visited these parts and given me the above report, and further states that in September the Warezan River was running 2 feet deep in flood and all the water evidently remaining entirely unused. ° 10. I intend before I leave to have a report made on the track running North-West-East from Lahej on the east of Jebal Manif, and up the Wadi Ad Dthabab towards Suleik. A railway running in that direction will probably be found to tap the Kotaibi country and draw the trade from the Yaffai country in this direction ; this latter is reported as very fertile, especially in coffee. 17. Trom this it will be seen that it is only necessary to extend a railway system to these outlying portions of the Hinterland to develop various sources of trade previously unknown or non-existent. Government have already expressed their opinion that railways must be run by private enterprise and there are three firms at present ready to take up the project, and no doubt more will be forthcoming from England. There is no doubt that if railways are made the trade of Turkish Yemen must find its way to Aden and develop Aden as a port whence the whole trade of Southern Arabia shall find its way to Europe and India. 19. I will now pass on to Aden itself with regard to its future develop ment. The Maala plain is the only existing piece of available land in the Aden Peninsula, and it is here that I recommend that the railway terminus should be. I would run it down to Hedjuff were it not that the Defence Scheme forbids the approach of buildings so near that hill; but there is no difficulty in running a double line from the proposed site of the Maala junction by the sea-side to the Maala side of Hedjuff. I pointed this out to Major- General Parsons, who is on the Defence Committee at Simla, when he was in Aden, and he saw no military objection to a pier being run out near the Aden Coal Company’s buildings. This rail would cost little or nothing, and trucks, loaded with material from the interior, would be run straight down from the Maala junction to the Hedjuff pier, thus obviating the enormous expense of dredging between Hedjuff and Maala. The formation and depth of the harbour is such that little or no dredging would be necessary to enable lighters to pass to and from the anchorage of ocean-going steamers to the pier I speak of, where lighters are loaded and unloaded from trucks. A plan of the dred ging required and the pier I propose is being prepared. 20. There are already applicants for ground on which to build warehouses on the sea-front of the Maala plain. A sea wall will have to be erected, but as far as I can hear the merchants are prepared to meet any expense incurred thereby. The curing of skins, which is now carried on at the Crater, should be conducted on the Maala plain, which would save the merchants the great expense of transporting skins to and from the Crater before export. This can be done without encroaching on the 1,200 yards zone considered requisite by the Military Defence Committee. I know there are some who advocate the 3963 F. D.14 bringing of the railway terminus into Tawahi, but this I do not recommend because of the expense of reclaiming fresh land, and the buying up of already existing reclaimed land between Jawahi and Hedjuif, but, granted that this may be overlooked, a large quantity of cooly labour must be brought into Tawahi where it has no room to ex[)and, thus endangering the health of our Port and of Steamer Point, the healthiest part of Aden. 21. I know many consider that the lighterage which is in the bands of some two or three firms would be done away with if the railway were carried to Tawahi, but I would point out that by my proposition I have done away with some two miles of lighterage, and I can see no reason why, if the lighter age is the remunerative business which some think, it should not pass into the hands of the Port Trust. No. 1543, dated Bombay Castle, the 24th February 1906. * Letters from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 7093, dated the 19th November 1905, with aicompani- ments, and No. 7510, dated the 10th December 1905, with aceompaniments. Memorandum from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 864, dated the 11th February 1906, with accompaniments. From—The Hon’ble Sir Steyning W. Edgerley, K.C.V.O,, C.I.E,, Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to Mr. Eraser’s letter No. 2609-E.B., dated the 8th July 1905, in which the Government of India expressed their willing ness to consider favourably proposals for the coustruction by private enterprise of a railway from Aden into the interior and in paragraphs 4 and 5 of which the conditions thought necessary by the Government of India were stated. In your No. 4417-E B., dated the 4th December 1905, were communicated the instructions of the Secretary of State that the views of the Government of India on the whole subject sho dd be laid before him before any steps are taken in connection with offers which may be received. 2. I am, therefore, now to submit copies * of the Resident’s further reports which give a sufficient account of the present proposals of the Resident in the matter. I am to attach a copy of the conditions si^ggested by the Resident to which the Sultan of Lahej has agreed and a memorandum of comments thereon subject to which it would seem unnecessary to object to the construction of a local line in the territories of the Sultan of Lahej between Dar-el-Amir and Nobat Dakim. 3. So far as the power of the Sultan to grant a concession is concerned, a doubt as to which is suggested by His Majesty’s Secretary of State, he cannot of course grant a concession which is likely to be attractive to promoters wiihout the concurrence of British authorities, as he cannot give a right of entry into . .._. , „, VT p . OQ Aden and access to the seaboard, but Article 9 of the Agreement t of 1849 does not enable the Resident actually to interfere with the Sultan’s autonomy in his own territories save by friendly advice. The history of his action in this matter, the terms of the notification recommended, and the present reports of the Political Resident show that procedure by way of advice and negotiation is not free from difficulty. 4. The three main points for consideration if the line is to be made are :— (1) whether permission shall be given for the line to enter Aden ; (2) whether any extension of the line beyond Nobat Dakim is to be permitted in the direction of Mavia. (3) whetter any extension of the line beyond Nobat Dakim is to be permitted in the direction of D’thala or Jebel-Jehaj. On the first of these points there appears to be no reason to refuse permis sion if the Government of India are prepared to allow the somewhat unusual terms which the Sultan desires. Eor a purely local line in the Sultan’s territories Government is not particularly interested in the terms demanded, but if the line is to enter a British port it is perhaps desirable that the grant of the permission to do so should be used to secure such modification of the15 conditions as to police, the disposal of civil disputes and matters affecting the safety of any public using the line as may seem to the Government of India to be necessary. The second suggestion is one which His Excellency the Governor in Council considers it most undesirable at present to discuss. It is very possible that the Turks would not regard with favour any proposal to make a line in the Aden Hinterland, but it is not necessary to consult them as to what is done behind the boundary recently demarcated. Nevertheless a proposal to take the line even as far as Musamir in the direction suggested need not at present be considered. The tl ird question of the possibility of an extension towards D’thala o* JebehJehaj really turns upon the intention of the Government of India in the matter of the establishment of a sanitarium for the Aden Garrison in that neighbourhood. 5. It is for consideration whether if the line is to enter Aden and even tually to pass beyond the territories whether Abdali or Hausbabi under the control of the Sultan of Lahej into those of other Chiefs it would not be desirable to negotiate with the Chiefs for the right of passage of a British line entirely under British control and then to negotiate vith promoters for its construction and working. The objections to such a course are the possible delay and the assumption of a certain responsibility outside Aden, the latter being a consideration which may possibly be of weight with His Majesty’s Secretary of State. No. 7093, dated the 19th November 1905. From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to report in reference to your No. 4528, dated the H 2oth July 1905, and marginally noted Your letter to Government of India, Kb. 2571, . , cs n. dated 22 nd April 1905. accompaniments, that Sultan Sir Ahmed Government of India, Foreign Department, letter Eadthl, K.O.S.L. has HOW agreed to the KO.2609-E.B , dated 8th July 1905. proposal that a notification shall be published inviting offers for the construction of a railway from Aden into the interior passing through his territory on the conditions attached to the draft notification herewith enclosed. He is willing that these offers shall be invited by the Political Resident of Aden for recommendation to him and to Govern ment. I have the honour to recommend the early publication of the notification accordingly. 2. The Assistant Commanding Royal Engineer is now actually engaged in drawing up the map asked for in paragraph 2(2) of your letter under reply and is at present touring within Abdali limits between Dar-el-Amir and Nobat Hakim for that purpose. The map will be submitted as soon after his return to Aden as possible, and meanwhile I submit at once the draft notification embodying the conditions to which Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadtbl only finally agreed on the evening of the 16th instant. 3. 1 venture to hope that these conditions will meet with the approval of Government. It has been extremely difficult to negotiate them owing to the altogether peculiar terms of the premature agreement which the Sultan entered into with Messrs. Cowasjee Hinshaw and Brothers, and particularly owing to the remarkable terms of partnership therein offered to the Sultan’s sons. 4. It will be observed that the conditions considered essential by the Government of India have been included. Others I consider desirable to meet both local and general needs, and certain of them are of course framed to meet the Abdali Sultan’s wishes and aspirations. 5. As to the first two conditions, I have the honour to recommend that some such period as that of 25 years specified should be fixed within which the right of purchase by Government or the Abdali Sultan should not be exercised.6. As to the 3rd condition, it is left to the companies concerned to offe* the conditions as to rates and fares which they are will ins: that Government should be granted for military purposes. I know of one company which would probably be willing to offer a reduction of one-third on ordinary fares. 7. The 4th and 5th conditions embody the jurisdiction arrangements which the Abdali Sultan is at present willing to accept. I may say that more has been secured than I at first anticipated. 8. The 6th and 7th conditions I consider desirable, and in regard to the 8th I trust that the general principles of management on Indian State railways may he considered as suitable as any other. It certainly seems necessary that some general principles of management should be specified at the outset. 9. The 10th condition is a valuable concession particularly in the event of the railway being extended, as I trust it eventually will be, on the other side of Abdali territory. 10. The 11th condition calls for no particular comment. The companies concerned will doubtless offer reasonable personal concessions of the kind referred to in the form of a modicum of free passes, saloon accommodation etc., etc. The 12th condition should prove useful in due course of time. 1L As to the 13th condition, the Abdali Sultan derives a very considerable proportion of his revenue from the transit dues which he has hitherto been allowed to collect, and the present would seem an inopportune time to endeavour to effect a reduction of what is of course a serious imposition on trade. Under treaty the Abdali Sultan can only charge a 2 per cent, ad valorem due on goods belonging to British subjects. And it might at some future date be advantageous to adjust all dues, a large part of which are now more or less arbitrary, upon a regular fixed scale. 12. I would remark for the information of Government that the Abdali Sultan has chosen the present opportunity to suggest an enhancement of the dues which he is under treaty entitled to levy on goods belonging to British subjects. The subject is therefore a delicate one to broach and a most difficult one to satisfactorily deal with. 1 am on the whole inclined to recommend a general adjustment at a fairly early date which should entail as substantial a reduction as possible of dues on ordinary goods at the cost of as slight an enhancement as possible of dues leviable on goods belonging to British subjects. 13. The total abolition of the dues which is of course most desirable is I fear, impossible, anyhow in the lifetime of the present Sultan, and could not ceitainly be effected without very seriousjdifficulty and probably very heavv expenditure. The collection of dues might be compounded for a large sum ot money, the recoupment of which might be arranged for by Government themselves imposing a moderate and regular taxation for a term of years. At present I am not in a position to go into figures. But should Government desire it, I will of course make arrangements to collect special statistics. 14. Granted the continuance of these dues and that the railway passes, as now proposed, through Abdali limits, there should be very considerable profit to the Abdali State from this source alone. And this is of course one of the main considerations upon which the present Sultan’s action has been based. 15. The 14th condition will, I trust, secure necessary facilities for the construction of telegraph and telephone. The adjustment of the charges will be a somewhat difficult matter. It will be remembered that in his agreement with Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers the Abdali Sultan secured a separate and distinct profit over this concession. 16. I would here remark for the information of Government that the percentage guaranteed in that agreement, in regard to both railway and telegraph, was on the gross takings and not on the net profit. The word “ gain ” in the English version of that agreement is misleading. 17. The 15th condition will, X hope, prove most valuable. At first the Sultan would not hear of any other arrangement than that he should personally be solely answerable for policing all the line lying within his limits and should be allowed to make whatever arrangement he thought fit. Police managementwill now be under the control of this Residency and the apportionment of cliAr^es can entail a certain proportionate contribution by the Railway Company in accordance with the principles observed on Indian railways. . 18- The 16 th condition is a modification of the Sultan’s first proposal, which it is necessary and on the whole seems harmless to insert. 19. The 17th condition is the most important of all in several respects and upon it really hinges the whole enterprise. Under it land is secured free of rent, the Abdali State is secured a real profit from the railway, and Sultan Sir Ahmed Padthl can, with the sanction of Government, be secured a personal stare of that gain for himself and his sons and lineal descendants, as distinct from his successors in the Sultanate, of which he has openly stated and which most certainly and apparently is the main consideration underlying his consent to and desire for the construction of a railway through his limits. 20. It is improbable that under the 18th condition he will receive from any other firm so extravagant an offer as that made by Messrs. Cowasjee Uinshaw and Brothers. The Sultan has himself comparatively little capital to invest for the purposes of partnership. And it is quite possible that a personal grant to him of a percentage of the net profit of the railway will prove equally tempting and seem to him more probable of actual realisation than the remark* able terms of partnership offered by Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers. 21. I therefore recommend that this condition be allowed and that sanction should be eventually accorded to any reasonable offer made thereunder. 22. In doing this I have the honour to invite consideration of the fact that with a certain proportion of his tribesmen and relations the Sultan will incur some odium over an innovation which at first may prove detrimental to the direct interests of those who gain from the regular traffic of camels between Aden and the interior. I would also invite consideration of the fact that succession to the Sultanate is not in Arabia hereditary, but dependent upon a plebiscite of the tribe. 2:1. It is therefore possible that Sir Ahmed Fadthl’s sons may suffer for the enterprise displayed by their father by the failure of one of them to succeed him upon his death, wide i he might otherwise have done. 24. I would at all events urge that the personal enterprise displayed by an individual Sultan in the face of that contingency merits special considera tion, and I would go so far as to very strongly recommend that if this enterprise is actually now brought to a successful issue, Government should themselves mark their appreciation thereof by the grant of a suitable personal political pension to Sir Ahmed Fadthl and to his private heirs. 25. It is of course with some regret that I have to impress Upon Govern* ment the fact that personal avarice is one of the strongest features in the character of the present Sultan of the Abdali. But such is undoubtedly the case. And I can only add now in this connection that if Government can authorise me to assure Sir Ahmed Fadthl that upon the successful opening of the railway under reasonable conditions he and his private heirs wiil be granted a fairly handsome personal pension in perpetuity, I can then most confidently assure Government that final negotiations will be brought to a prompt and a really satisfactory conclusion. 26. Final negotiations will probably prove more difficult than those now concluded and the result will very largely depend upon the manner in which Sir Ahmed Fadthl’s privy purse as distinct from his State exchequer is affected. 27. The possibility of avoiding his territory, by an initial digression of the line in the direction of either Amriga on one side or Khanfar on the other has suggested itself to me, but this would entail such serious general political complications that I hesitate to invite serious consideration of the idea. The avoidance of Abdali transit dues would be of course a vast gain to the general trade of the district, but the violent hostility of the Abdali coupled with the difficulties involved in the present qon-existenoe of clearly defined interstatal boundaries would, anyhow at the outset, be pregnant with the possibility of a greater immediate loss.18 28. At some future date when interstatal boundaries have been more precisely defined, and should circumstances of an exceptional nature render such a measure for any reason desirable, a digression of the nature indicated might be effected. But at the outset and granted fairly reasonable concessions by 'the Abdali, I do not recommend the entertainment of such an idea. 29. 1 therefore recommend, for the present consideration of Government, the publication of tbe present conditions and the grant of all possible conces sions to a ruler who, whatever his failings, is at least imbued with a spirit ot enterprise much above bis fellows and countrymen. 30 I have inserted at present no condition as to compensation being paid for loss’actually sustained by any individual landholder or house-holder by the construction of the line. Should Government consider it necessary I can arrange for its insertion. The point was discussed with the Abdali Sultan, but as be demurred to the decision in the matter of the amount of the compen sation being decided in my Court, it was for the time being dropped. 31 As to the route the line shall follow through the Hinterland, I hope shortly to submit the map showing this and the site of the proposed terminus and stations For the present I would simply state that local opinion and also tbe opinion of tbe Abdali Sultan is very strongly in favour ot making ^ . i r fii^ /Uc+niofa in tlio vieinitv of that Diace the immediate objective of tbe railway. 32 Tliis route should, I gather, tap a maximum of trade and it would have lhe advantage of avoiding the Amiri, Alawi and Baishi claims to transit duty: the only imposts being Turkish and Haushabi in addition to tlie Abdali. 33 Finally, I have the honour to recommend that the gauge of the proposed railway shall be either one metre or else the same gauge as the liediaz Railway, 105 metres. The Ahdali Sultan would be, I think, prepared to a-ree to either. And on the whole I am strongly of opinion that a metre gauge would be best. It would answer all requirements both military and civil and in this respect have a distinct advantage over a smaller gauge. On the other hand, a broader gauge is not necessary and would be too expensive. It might be desirable to publish this with the notification, and I would suggest accordingly that a metre gauge should be at once decided upon. 34 . I venture to hope that the net result of these preliminary negotiations mav be approved of. The draft conditions coyer more ground than was contemplated by the Government of India in their letter No. 2609-E.B., dated the 8th July 1905, but will, I trust, eventually be recognised as essential to the proper working of the proposed railway. The Sultan’s consent to them has been gained not without a struggle, but without friction. Ai.d I have the honour to bring to the notice of Government the services rendered in the matter by my Acting First Assistant, to whose tact and patience the result of these preliminary negotiations is largely due.

HANCOCK, AHMED FADTHL MOHSIN. Aden ; The 16th November 1905. No. 7510, dated the 10th December 1905. From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay in the Political Department. In continuation of my letter No. 7093, dated the 19th November 1905, and as promised in paragraph 2 thereof, I now have the honour to forward the map prepared by the Assistant Commanding Royal Engineer, Aden Brigade, showing as requested in your letter No. 4528, dated the 20th July 1905, approximately the site of the terminus proposed in Aden and the route the line will follow through the Hinterland up to Nobat Dakim. 2 . I attach copy of the Assistant Commanding Royal Engineer’s letter No. 3350, dated the 2nd instant, and of the accompanying report from which the present attitude of the Abdali Sultan will be sufficiently apparent. His views will be further ascertained in due course after those of Government have been received. ‘ - 3. As to the extension of the line above Nohat Dakim, I am of opinion that this will be desirable at as early a date as possible in the direction of Mavia by which the more important caravans of the fertile Taiz District now proceed. In this connection I have the honour to invite reference to paragraphs 23 and 24 of Mr. EitzMaurice’s despatch to the Foreign Department of the Govern ment of India, dated Perim, 30th April 1905, and to state that the Political Officer at D’thala has been requested to submit a confidentiaL report in due course upon that actual possibility of any rectification of the border in the vicinity of Mavia. 4. As to the proposed terminus in Aden, I am of opinion that this should be at Maala and that if possible a public wharf should be constructed near the Aden Coal Company’s Wharf at Hedjuff to which a double line of rail should extend. This pier would be within the 1,200 yards zone of the Hedjuff defences, but would in no way mask the fire thereof. The pier would be right under the defences and could not be reached by an enemy seeking for cover. 5. I pointed this out myself to General Parsons, the Inspector-General of Artillery, on the occasion of his recent inspection of the Aden Defences, and he expressed the opinion that it could in no way prove detrimental to the defences of Aden, rw s 21 6 . Granted that a good deal of the merchandise imported to Adctl consists of skins, coffee, and other goods which require manipulation, I am strongly of opinion, in which the Principal Medical Otficer of the district concurs, that this should as far as possible be kept out of the Crater which is already congested. And I would therefore propose that building sites should now be freely granted for the reception of merchandise on the vacant space at present existing between Obstruction Pier (near Maala) and the limit of the 1,200 yards zone of the HedjutT Defences. With a view to improving the sanitation of the Crater, I am of opinion that a good many buildings and store depots there should at an early opportunity be demolished and re-erected on the Maala plain. 7 . I would therefore favour no branch line of railway into the Crater except for passenger traffic only between that place and Tawahi. This, I think, might with advantage follow hereafter, but for the present I am in favour of the railway line terminating near the Aden Coal Company’s ground under the Hedjuff defences. 8 . My proposals would have the effect of to some extent relieving existing congestion in the Crater and of avoiding the increased congestion which would he caused by railway buildings and sidings there. 9 . I would lay particular stress upon the point that the extension of the railway as far as Hedjuff would entail comparatively trifling expense as compared to the heavy cost of dredging a large channel to Maala, by which means alone the existing wharf there would be m^de accessible to steamers. The extra dredging which would be necessary to make a public wharf at Hedjuff accessible to large vessels would be comparatively little. 10. Whilst I am strongly in favour of a public wharf at Hedjuff in direct railway communication with the interior and directly accessible to cargo vessels' without the troublesome and expensive intervention of private owned cargo boats and lighters, I am not in favour of the proposal that cargo should be brought on to the Tavvahi Reclamation. The Tawahi Division of the Settlement has hitherto proved healthy and I am opposed to any scheme which would entail its congestion with a large cooly population. 11 . I would point out that both the railway terminus and the store depots and other buildings above projected would have the protection of the Mansuri Ridge and of the Hedjuff defences in the event of an attack on Aden, whereas in the event of a determined attack being made on the Crater, all buildings there would probably have to be abandoued. 12. In conclusion, I can only urge with a view to the success of the projected railway and the general trade development of the Settlement of Aden that the earliest possible action should be taken to secure as liberal a modifica tion as possible of the restrictions contained in Rules 3 and 4 of those issued under Section 13 of the Aden Settlement Regulation VII of 1900 and published in Government Notification No. 6938-A., dated the 15th October 1903, at page 1370 1:^75 cf the Bombay Government Gazette, Part I, dated the 29th October 1903. 1 am of opinion that the future progress and prosperity of Aden very largely depend upon the extent to which the Maala plain can hereafter be utilised for building purposes. No. 3350, dated the 2nd December 1905. From—L ieutenant-Colonel R. Leigh, R.E., Assistant Commanding Royal Engineer, Aden Brigade, To—The First Assistant Resident, Aden. In reply to your No. 6141, dated the 9th October 1905,1 forward herewith a report and tracing on the proposed railway to Nobat Dakim. ^ His Highness the Sultan of Labej sent a representative “Husain Bin” &lt;Musabain ?) to show me the line lie proposed for the ™ lwa y-^ the whole country and considered the line proposed by the Sultan—the one 3963 F. D.A 22 now shown in the plan would probably be the best; the only alteration I proposed in the Sultan’s plan was to cross the Wadi-es-Saghir a little more to the south. Husain Bin (Musabain ?) informed me that the Sultan had quite determined that the line should not go through any of the cultivated land ^ round El Hauta and therefore must be kept at some distance. m J inspection I called on the Sultan and informed him that I in the mam agreed with his proposal—he then at once said that he changed his mind and wished the railway to run close to El Hauta; he after wards added that it must not run through any cultivated land, but must run on the embankments between the fields. I pointed out that this was impossible as the turns round the fields were much too quiek : he afterwards stated he wished it to go quite outside the Lahej cultivation. During the interview I formed the opinion that it will not be difficult to get the Sultan to agree almost to any location considered advisable. The onlv thing he seemed inclined to insist on was that there must be a station at Dar- el-Amir w here the line enters his territory. Proposed railway from Aden to Robot Dahim. t n °rth of Aden is for the most part sandy desert up to the foot of the hills at Nobat Dakim, which is about 900 feet above sea-level. t v ^rom Nohat Dakim the mountains rise steeply to about 7,800 feet at Jebei-Jehaff, the hmit of territory under British protection about 40 miles north of Nobat Dakim. The hill country is bare rocky mountain with onlv a little cultivation at the bottoms of the valleys and the rivers are in consequence panic to very heavy floods. 1 .

AI)out 2 miles south of Zaida the Tiban divides the western branch much tile larger being called A1 Kabir and the eastern As Saghi. Wadi-el-Khabir opposite Lahej is a gorge about 150 yards wide with vertical clay banks about 20 feet high and subject to much the same floods as at Nohat. Below this it rapidly diminished till at A1 Ahmad. There are relcTsoTar SaDd 6 t0 10 yai ' dS Wide and ^ ^avy floods vu W a&lt; li-es-Saghir to the east of Lahej is smaller than the ‘Wadi-ol- abir and opposide Lahej is about IhO yards wide and about 12 to 15 feet eep m clay. This gorge soon disappears opposite Bir Said Ali; it divides into several streams and most of the water is taken for irrigatiog the wide valW there; opposite Fiynsh the valley is a wide depression with small channels and small drams to irrigate a width of 2 miles of country. Near Bir Tahir there are small channels in the sand often filled with drifting sand • only heavy floods roach the pnrt of the valley east of Imad, ^ y heavy In the fork between these streams is El Bauta, the capital of Lahei Thp country here is clayey sand covered with millet from just P below the fork of into ^ty 8 n or t l h ot;; 8 d a ^. field8 5 ° f ^“ut^ West of the Tiban and Wadi-el-Khabir, the countrv from in n i the‘sea^ifis mostly Wsa^lt W^TAbrnm Is ^ ^ des e r id tr l,p °1, te , Wabt j a sandy de P ression 15 to 20^e U et Wow7he e rest b o°f U [he desert with small channels 5 to 10 yards wide, the water only occtionally5 23 coming as far as opposite A1 Waht in heavy floods. The ground at Nobat is hard gravel with boulders and occasionally rock. The river Bileh emerges from the mountain from the north-east at Nobat; it is a gravelly nullah 5(fto 60 yards wide and 4 or 5 feet deep covered with boulders. It is quite dry, except in times of flood. Near El Anad it turns to the west and enters the Tiban in a stream about 100 yards wide and 3 or 4 feet deep in heavy floods. The valley of the Bileh runs to the south-east from El Anad, but it is stopped at its north end and the river has not run in the valley for over 50 years, This is a deep sandy valley w ith no stream except in heavy rain and then very small and soon disappearing in the sand. The ground between Wadi-es-Saghir and Wadi Bileh is sand—mostly hard on the west side and loo'e sand near the Bileh. On the east of the Wadi Bileh is a steep slope of loose sand in parts about 100 feet high and beyond that a large extent of loose sand, the steep slope towards the Bileh being apparently formed by sand blown over. Course of railway. It is considered inadvisable to locate the railway west of the Wadi-el- Khabir and Tiban. The only advantase would be that from opposite Waht to opposite Nobat Dakim it would be very cheaply constructed, as it would cross no stream, would run along land with an even slope without valleys or bills, very little excavation would be wanted, stone can be obtained nearly all along the loute and the river is near for supplying water to the working parties. But it would run entirely through the desert at a distance from villages and cultivation—and it w^o^d run a long way from A1 Hauta and on the other side of the large Wadi-el-Khabir. It would be on the wrong side of the river at Nobat and from north of Zaida would run through the land of a tribe not friendly. A line running close to A1 Hauta, which is, if possible, very desirable, as A1 Hauta is the only large town on the route, would run through 8 or 10 miles of cultivated land and on emerging from this would be between two large Wadis subject to heavy floods and necessitating a large bridge. The Sultan of Lahej is very averse to taking a strip of land through the cultivated countiy. On the whole, the line shown on the plan seems advisable. A station at Har-el-Amir is specially required by the Sultan of Lahej, as it is the first place in his territory. A station near Eiyush—cross the Wadi-es- Saghir north of Eiyush where it is small and the railway will be mostly on a small embankment and then running north-west near the east of Wadi-es- Saghir. Another station might be near Zoida. Erom Nobat further extension would probably eventually be up the Tiban Valley; there seems to be no difficulty in reaching at any rate Musemir; above that the country is not well enough known to give any opinion. In Aden it is suggested a station should be located south-west of Maala and a small Branch line run to Maala Wharf. Erom Maala the best line seems to be to tunnel under the hill and run out through the small isthmus. Stations are also proposed at Khormaksar and Sheikh Othman. It would be a great convenience to extend the line from Maala to Steamer Point, w hich can be done by running the line on the north side of the main road with a terminus on the newly reclaimed land at Tawahi.

Meanwhile it would interest the Political Resident to hear the views of your Chamber as to the particular direction in which it would be most advantageous to construct such a line. 3. Any further views which your Chamber may entertain on the subject generally would also be of interest to the Political Resident. Dated the 2nd February 1906. From—The Honorary Secretary to the Chamber of Commerce, Aden, To—The Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden. Referring to your No. 6582 of 27th|October 1905,1 have the honour to say the subject of the proposed Aden-Hinterland Railway was under discussion at a general meeting of the Chamber on 30th Januarv, and the following resolution, proposed by Mr. J. Parker (National Bank of India) and seconded by Mr. H. Adamally, was carried unanimously, viz ,\— “ The Chamber urges Government to give every possible facility • to any one willing to construct and manage a railway as far as possible towards the interior, preferably by way of D’thala, and consider it would be in the interests of the general Public to have the work started without delay.”m 25 Draft of proposed conditions under which a railway may he constructed by private enterprise from Aden into the interior of Arabia agreed to by Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadthl, K.C.SJ. Sultan of Abdalij 16th November 1905, with comments thereon. No. Ill IV VI Conditions. Government reserve the right to purchase so much of the line as lies within British territory at not less than cost price if it be desired to do so at any time after the lapse of a period of twenty-five years from the date of the com mencement of the line. The Abdali Sultan reserves the right to pnr- chpse so much of the line as lies within Abdali territory at not less than cost price if it be desired to do so at any time after the lapse of a period of twenty-five years from the date of commencement of the line. Government shall have the right to use the railway for military purposes underspecial conditions as to rates and fares. Offences committed on the line of railway shall be dealt with in accordance with the treaties existing or hereafter concluded between the British Government and the Abdali Sultan. The British Government shall exercise sole jurisdiction over all Europeans apd British subjects and the Abdali Sultan shall exercise jurisdiciion over bis subjects. Offences committed on the railway by sub jects of other Native States shall be disposed of in the Court of the Political Resident at Aden; hut offences committed on the railway within Abdali limits by subjects of other Native States of the Aden Protectorate in which Abdali subjects are concerned shall be disposed of by the Abdali Sultan. Civil suits in which the Railway Company is concerned shall be disposed of by the Court of the Resident at Aden. Otherwise civil juris diction shall continue to be exercised in accordance with the treaties existing or here after concluded between the British Govern ment and the Abdali Sultan. A plan and estimate of the railway shall be submitted for the approval of the Abdali Sultan and the sanction of Government before the construction of the line is started. Comments of the Bombay Government. In conditions I and II the words “at not less than cost price ” are not sufficiently expres sive, as they do not specify what the pur- chase price shall eventually be. For this purpose the cost of the line for all items of way and works and all extras except rolling stock may be limited to a maximum per mile (the amount to be more exactly determined after detailed estimate) ; the rolling stock can be taken over at a fair valuation, prices beintr subject to arbitration within limits specified. The following may he added at the end of conditions I and II s “or at the expiration of any subsequent period of ( ? ten years), subject to (? 12) months’ notice of (their, Govern ment’s or the Sultan’s as the case may be) intention to purchase. ” It is probable that the Abdali Sultan could not afford to purchase the line within his territory and Government should, with the Sultan’s assent, secure the right to purchnse the whole line so far as the promoters are concerned. In the case of State Railways in India leased to companies as also in the case of assisted rail ways, the contracts prescribe that all services which the Secretary of State may require the Company to perform for various Depart ments of the State, including the Military, shall be performed “on the same general conditions as may for the time being be in force on State Railawys and at such rates as may be approved by the Secretary of State not being less than the rates in force for the time bemg for similar services on State Railways on the same gauge. In practice the rates paid by Government are those obtaining for similar services on State Rail ways. The practice obtaining in the case of Indian State Railways in such matters might be generally followed all through this noti fication. As regards conditions IV and V, the Political Resident, Aden, emphasises the point that in the matter of jurisdiction arrangements more liberal terms have been secured from the Abdali Sultan than was at first anticipated. The Bombay Government are, however, of opinion that if the line is to run into Aden or beyond Nobat Dakim, it is desirable that the Sultan’s assent that Government should exercise full jurisdiction on the line should if possible be secured. Conditions VI, VII and VIII appear unobjec tionable subject to the proviso that as regards condition VI the following should be added at the end of that condition :—“ Construction must be started within (?6) months after the approval of the plans and estimates ; and the line duly completed for opening to public traffic within a further period of (?18) months. At the end of condition VIII the following may be added :—“ A schedule of maximum rates and fares shall be approved by Govern ment.*’ ReMIBXS.26 Draft of proposed conditions—contd. No. Conditions. Comments of the VII The railway shall be inspected by an officer appointed by Government before being opened to traffic, and shall be subject to such period ical inspections as Government may consider necessary for any purpose. Bombay Government. VIII The general principles of railway management as observed on Indian State railways shall be followed. IX XI The management of the line shall vest in the Railway Company, but accounts shall he periodically submitted for the inspection of the Abdali Sultan and of Government. All apparatus and material required for the construction or working of the railway shall he free of transit and customs duty. Special privileges shall he extended to the Abdali Sultan and to members of his family, and to the Political Resident at Aden and his personal staff. XII Special privileges shall be afforded to the Government Postal Department. There should he a full stop after “ Company ” and for the word “ but ” the following sub stituted : The usual Capital and Revenue and at the end the following added : “ The capital accounts may be audited on behalf of Government and the Ahdali Sultan, if con sidered necessary.** Rolling stock may be included among the articles to be exempted from the payment of duty. The Political Resident attaches importance to the concession of exemption from the Sultan’s taxation, particularly in the event of an extension of the railway beyond the Abdali territory. It may be advisable to specify the privileges at the outlet and provide that the Railway or Government supply the Sultan with a special private saloon which with one third class carriage he may be allowed to attach to a train (on sufficient notice) within the limits of Lnhej and into and out of Aden. He might also be allowed a special train on occasion or a special engine to haul his saloon (with a few additional carriages) at non-train timings at special low charges for engine power. The condition might also provide for a special saloon for the Resident built at Government expense to be hauled whenever required by high State officials on the sam&lt; conditions and rates as prevail in such case, in India. As in condition III, the practice obtaining in the case of Indian State Railways ffliofcld be the guicjing factor. XIII Every facility shall be afforded for the collec tion of the transit dues to which the Abdali Sultan is entitled by treaty and usage. These dues shall be collected at such place or places as may be decided upon by the Political Resident at Aden, in consultation with the Abdali Sultan. The Political Resident states that the Abdali Sultan derives a very considerable proportion of his revenue from the transit dues which he has hitherto been allowed to collect, and that the present would seem an inopportune time to endeavour to effect a reduction of imposi- tionjon trade. The condition might further state that the Railway shall arrange for the collection of the transit dues by a system of addition to rates and fares and pay it over as was suggested in the Cutch case. XIV If it is desired to construct any telegraph or telephone in connection with the railway, the project shall be fir.-t reported for the separate sanction of G vernment, and the system shall be under Impei ial control. The Indian Telegraph Act and subsidiary Regula tions shall be applied. Charges shall be adjusted as hereafter arranged between Government, the Abdali Sultan and the Railway Company subject to the consent of the Abdali Sultan and the sanction of Government. If the line is to be constructed on the basis suggested, the provision seems sufficient. Riiubis.m 27 Draft of proposed conditions— No. Condition*. Comment* of the Bomb*; Government. Ehxams. XV There shall be a separate body of railway police under a Superintendent and such proportion of them as may hereafter be decided upon shall be employed by the Abdali Sultan. Charges on account of the railway police shall be apportioned as may be here after arranged between the Political Resident, the Abdali Saltan and the Railway Company. This condition is a compromise, as the Political Resident states that the Sultan would not hear of any other arrangement than that he should personally be solely answerable for policing all the line lying within his limits, and should be allowed to make whatever arrangements he thought fit. The Resident adds that under the arrangement proposed police management will now be under the control of the Residency and the apportion ment of charges can entail a certain propor tionate contribution by the Company in accordance with the principles observed on Indian railways. If, however, the line is to run into Aden, it would be preferable that the whole of the police should be under Government control and the Company required to pay the cost. XVI XVII The Railway Company shall issue a special warning to all their employees and passengers to abstain from any acts which might offend the religious susceptibilities of the subjects of the Abdali Sultan. In regard to such matters and also in regard to the establish ment and management of refreshment rooms in the line, the Railway Comp»ny shall abide by the advice of the Political Resident at Aden. No refreshment rooms shall be opened on the line within Abdali limits without the permission of the Abdali Sultan. In lieu of the concession to construct a railway through Abdali territory and in lieu of rent on the land granted for the purpose, the Abdali Sultan shall receive as royalty such percentnge of the net profits of the railway as may be arranged with the sanction of Government. Such proportion of this as may be arranged with the sanction of Government shall be allotted as a personal royalty to Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadthl aud his direct lineal descendants. The Political Resident states that this condi tion is a modification of the Sultan’s first proposal, which it is necessary and on the whole harmless to insert. There appears to be no objection to it. The XVII and XVIII conditions are for the reasons stated by the Political Resident the most important of all from the Sultan’s point of view and upon them hinges the whole enterprise. No doubt the suggestion of a pers mal royalty to His Highness and his family is unusual, but possibly the promoter may be prepared to allot a block of shares, and the royalty to the Chief may perhaps be regarded as a method of paying for the land. XVIII Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadthl of the Abdali shall either in his own name or in that of his sons or relations be admitted to partnership in the Railway Company on such terms as may 6e arranged. 6 No. R.

Letter to Eis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Proposed railway from Aden to Nobat Dakim.India Office, London, 4th May 1906. Secret, No. 20. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, Views of His Majesty's Govern- The appointment of a new Resident at Aden ment on the main questions arising seems to he a proper occasion for laying before in connection with the tribes of the Your Excellency the views of His Majesty s Govern, Aden Protectorate. ment on the main questions arising in connection with the tribes of the Aden hinterland. The correspondence also addressed to the Government of India by the Governor of Bombay in Council, which, by your instructions, His Excellency has forwarded to me under date 12th March 1906, appears to invite an immediate consideration of the principles that it would now he most politic to follow in that region. 2. It appears to be supposed by some that the process of delimitation, satisfactorily carried out in concert with the Turkish Government in the Aden hinterland and establishing a definite frontier between the territories of the Sultan and certain of the tribes, brought uith it an extension of the responsibilities and obli gations of Great Britain. Lord Lansdovvne, however, who was actively concerned in the transaction, explicitly rejected that construction of what had taken place. In the House of Lords on 80th March 1903, replying to a question whether the demarcation arranged with Turkey had enlarged the British sphere of influence, he said: “ With regard to the responsibility for these ** territories, I do not see why what has taken pine e “ should make any difference in these responsi- “ bilities. AA r e have never desired to interfere “ w ith the internal and domestic affairs of the “ tribes. On the other hand, we have throughout “ made it perfectly plain that we shoidd not “ tolerate the interference of any other Bower with “ them.” In this interpretation His Majesty’s present advisers in the fullest sense concur. J he security and strength of Aden as one of the main posts and fortresses that guard the line between England and India, must always be a standing object in national policy. That strength av ill obviously be impaired and not augmented by quarrels with the tribes, by intervention in their disputes, by multiplication of formal agreements S. 13. Awith them, by locating troops at a distance from the fortifications of Aden, or by any excessive readiness to resort to expeditions out of all pro portion, whether immediate or indirect, to either the occasions for them or to any clear advantage to be gained by them. 3. If, as His Majesty’s Government have decided, the main purpose of the recent delimi tation is achieved by the fixing of a line beyond which Turkish troops or agents cannot advance, I submit to your Excellency the following propo sitions as well fitted to carry out our decision. So far as the Turkish frontier is concerned, it is in the highest degree desirable that the importance of trespasses across the line, which are neither serious nor deliberate, should not be exaggerated, and, should a protest be required, it would naturally be by way of action at Constantinople. Outside the territory of British India and within a limited area of the Protectorate similar to that formerly known on the Somali coast as the ten-mile limit, internal disturbances would call for interposition. But beyond that line our Agent should be careful to avoid every step that might lead us into military or political entanglements, without the express sanction of the Secretary of State. A railway to Dthali and a cantonment or sanatorium there, should be considered as outside the contemplation of the Government. This being so, the large body of troops now stationed at Dthali should he with drawn, leaving only a sufficient escort for the Political Officer so long as he may remain there. 4 . The retention of a Political Officer at Dthali Was originally provisional. In September 1904 my Predecessor assented to the proposal of the Government of India “as a temporary measure, to “ retain a British officer and a small body of troops “ at Dthali.” This assent he limited to one year, requesting that after the expiry of that time he should he informed as to the existence of “ any “ real necessity for maintaining the official and his “ escort at Dthali.” In November 1905, however, he accepted the reasons of the Government of India for making it permanent. In view of the change of circumstances which will be the result of the present instructions, His Majesty’s Govern ment are satisfied that the arrangement need not be regarded as a permanent one, and that it will be sufficient if the Political Agent is permitted to visit Dthali temporarily and for special purposes as occasion may require. For the present I leave it to your Excellency to decide when, after the retirement of the troops, the Political Officer and his escort should be withdrawn. 5. The despatch of postal runners or agents of the British Government into the interior is to be as much as possible avoided. Any project for disarming the tribes in the nine cantons should be dismissed from serious consideration. Punitive expeditions for offences committed during thedemarcation, and not punished then and there, are now out of the question. No demonstration along the frontier, whether demarcated or not, seems to be needed, and, without previous reference to me, no attempts should be made to conclude fresh treaties. 0. I trust that these propositions may commend themselves to your Excellency, as principles to be pressed upon the attention of the Government of Bombay, and as matter for instructions to the Itesident whom your Excellency has appointed to Aden. Any other policy might drawf us into a re petition on another scene of the recent transactions m Somali Land. I have the honour to be, Mv Lord, Your Lordship s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) John Mokley.Policy in hinterland. India Office, London, 5th October 1906. Secret, No. 35. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Loud, regard to the Aden I h&lt;r\'e given careful consideration to Tour Excellency’s Secret Despat'di of 9th August, No. 119, as well as t &gt; tin 1 enclosures with which vou favour me containing the correspondence with the Government of Bombay and the Resident at Aden. I am obliged to Your Excellency for thus placing me in complete possession ot the opinions held both at Simla and by the local authorities upon the points of cetail involved in the policy laid down in my Despatch No. ’20 (Secret) of 4th May. 2. The discussion throws light upon the views that have influenced the course pursued since the delimitation of the external frontier of the Aden protectorate, and it marks the difference of opinion that exists as to the objects sought by the local authorities and His Majesty’s Government respec tively. The retention of a part of the Aden garrison at D’rhala, and the permanent presence there of a British Agent, are advocated by the Government of India as developing the policy of the delimitation by the extended establishment of British authority among the tribes on our side of the border, fo accomplish this end, it appears to be considered necessary to overcome the reluctance ot the tribes men to accept the suzerainty of the Amir of D’thala; to carry our influence into the territory of other tribes with whom we had practically no dealings till, during the delimitation, treaties were concluded with representatives of the Upper laffai, who are now discovered to be persons of no real authority \ to secure tor the Chiefs of the protected tribes ready and friendly advice in the settlement of tribal disputes; to check the spread of the Pan- Islamic programme in Yemen; and to maintain our reputation with the Arabs. In the opinion of His Majesty s Government, on the other hand, British interests at Aden are mainly centred in the British territory and fortress at Aden, and the primary object of recent arrange ments with the Ottoman Porte was to reduce the risk of international complications by arriving at a definite understanding as to the outer boundary of S. 26. Athe tribal country in political relations with the British settlement. Turkish infractions of a serious character since the notification made to the Porte in 1873, have been mainly due to the want of a map recognised as correct by both the Turkish and the British Governments. Within the pro tectorate of the nine cantons since the occupation of Aden in there has usually been some degree of disturbance, and the precise authority of the leading Chiefs has changed so much from time to time that our policy in direct negotiations with the tribesmen has necessarily followed the varying exigencies of the day. For instance, the Subaihis were, by the engagement of the 5th of May 1881, recognised as under the ‘’sovereign authority” of the Abdali Sultan, but after five years it became necessary to treat that arrangement as inoperative, and the Subaihis resumed their former indepen dent relations with the Aden Itesidency. The guiding face is that during the last halt century these inter-tribal disputes have, to a large extent, legulated themselves, and admitted of peaceful settlement by the liesident at Aden, without the continual presence of either troops or Political Agents in the interior. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government the recent treaties of demarcation and protectorate ought to strengthen the hands of the Political authorities at Aden in resuming the long-standing policy of inactivity, and call for no departure from it. It may be perfectly true that the Arabs expect British troops to remain in their country, and that some Chiefs and some sections of tribes might be glad of their support. But His Majesty’s Government never authorised any action calculated to commit them to this extension of their responsibilities, involving, as it must, an augmentation of the Aden garrison, and an increase of expenditure. The protection formally extended to the tribes is a protection against foreign aggression, and had particular reference to the proceedings of the Turkish Government, in respect of which the situation has been fundamentally altered by the settlement of the frontier agreed to by the Porte. The presence of a British garrison at H’thala is onlv too likely to he regarded as inimical to Turkish interests, and as indicating an intention to interfere more than formerly in matters of tribal adminis tration. It is inconsistent with a policy of reliance on the effect of diplomatic representations at Con stantinople in the event of violations of the frontier or serious disputes, and for the reasons stated in paragraph 2 of my Despatch dated 4th of May 1906, is open to other serious objections. 3. With much satisfaction I observe that the general principle now decisively adopted by His Majesty’s Government commands the cheerful adherence of Your Excellency in Council. You inform me (paragraph 4) that you “ most cordially “ subscribe to the policy of non-interference with “ the internal and domestic policy of the tribes.”r Jliis cardinal principle, then, wo hold in common. The suggested applications of that principle, how ever, disclose a view of its practical meaning, which I am unable to share. For example, Your Excel lency discusses the use of a subsidy in enabling the Amir of D thaia to hold his own either against the tribes or the Turks ; and the point is emphasised that “such success as has hitherto attended the “ policy of consolidating the waning authority of the Amir ox DThala, has been mainly due to the “ moral and material support which is afforded to “ him by the presence of our political agent and “ the British force at that place.” Or, as the Aden Resident puts it, the moral support of our troops “ will in time overcome the reluctance (of the “ tribesmen) to accept the Amir’s suzerainty.” Surely here is an unexpected version of the policy of non-interference with the domestic affairs of the tribes, and studious non-entangle ment in purely tribal affairs (paragraph 8). It seems to reduce cordial adhesion to the mud. less hopeful level of pious opinion. This rather perplexing interpretation of the policy of non-interference and freedom from entangle ment undergoes in later paragraphs a still more formidable extension. “ If Turkish intrigue and “ Mahometan fanaticism are to he left uncontrolled “ in that country [the Aden Hinterland] ”—so the Government of India assure me—“ we fear “ that we shall before long be involved in opera- “ tions that might have been avoided by a firm “and consistent attitude towards the tribes” (paragraph 13). But what is this attitude to be ? Interference or non-interference ? AVe are to take in hand from Aden the control of Turkish intrigue and Mahometan fanaticism. “ It [our withdrawal],” says the Resident at Aden, “ would afford them “ [the Turks] unlimited opportunities for . . . “ the furtherance of the Fan-Islamic programme.” Can we hope to exercise this control over such subtle and pervasive forces as fanaticism and intrigue without meddling in any of the internal and domestic doings of the tribes ? AYe are urged to look even further than this. “ There is a real danger,” Your Excellency warns us, “ that, if wo “ now withdraw, in a few years we may bo “ confronted with an independent Arabia.” These apprehensions, if I understand them aright, point to an indefinite period of such observation and control as would either be meaningless and in effectual, or else would inevitably draw us into that active, perpetual, and costly interference, to the mischiefs of which we all with entire sincerity profess ourselves alive. 4 . Here I find myself compelled to draw atten tion to the Indian aspect of this discussion—that being the only aspect with which the Government of India is immediately concerned. AA e are, it would seem, to extend the military and financial liabilities of India, not merely to help or defendthe fortress at Aden, hut “ to stem a religious tide in Yemen,” though, hy the way, the stemming of religious tides is a delicate operation, and has never hitherto been regarded as a desirable or even tolerable element in Indian policy. Next, I would ask whether this is a ease in which we should be guided by precedents from the North-West and other frontiers of the Indian Empire. The Aden Hinterland is not a frontier province in any natural sense. Aden is an outlying post administratively connected with Bombay, and wholly different in its character from the boundaries that have been reached upon our vast border line to-c'ay after twenty years of conflict both in counsel and in arms. The position of Aden, in short, in the ordering of Indian territories and policy is peculiar, and arguments overlooking this circumstance may easily fall wide of any true mark of Indian statesmanship. i . A. 5. Whether the rise of an independent Arabia he a near or a remote contingency^, there can at least be no doubt that the advent of such a question upon the international horizon, whatever part a British Government might choose to take in respect of it, would assuredly be a subject of Imperial policy, not to be decided by considerations of Indian interest alone or even primarily. Lord Salisbury, as Secretary of State for India, pointed out, in the year 1874, the marked change that has been effected in the military, political, and commercial value to Great Britain of our position at Aden, since it came into our possession as a decayed settlement of comparatively small impor tance nearly seventy years ago. The Suez Canal wholly 6 7 transformed its place in any system of Indian interests, making it the kev to the great commercial highway to the East, used by 7 great fleets of merchant ships of all the nations of the world. We are thus involved, said Lord Salisbury, “ in diplomatic action in which India “ has no direct voice and over which she has no “ practical control.” The occupation of Aden, in short, derives its principal importance “ from its &lt;&lt; relation to the general foreign policy of the “ Empire, in which it holds a position analogous to that of Malta and Gibraltar.” This propo sition is beyond dispute. In view of it any enlargement of Indian obligations in regard to Aden is wholly unjustifiable, and all operations tending in any degree towards such an enlargement are to be sedulously and vigilantly avoided. 6. From these larger considerations of general policy, I pass to what may be regarded as the secondary arguments in your Excellency’s Des patch. It is stated that Aden is unhealthy, and that troops cannot lie trained at Aden. Neither the Aden Administration reports nor the Army Medical reports accessible to me tend to prove that the climate has become of late more injurious either to Native or European troops. Compared even with the returns for Poona, Aden seemsto l)e not particularly unhealtliy. Indeed, it would appear that the Native troops have suffered more severely than before since they were required to serve in the interior. As regards training I understand that the position is not affected by anything that lias occurred of late, and so long as our military and naval requirements demand the presence of a garrison on this distant portion of the Presidency of Bombay, the situation must he alleviated otherwise than by the main tenance of a sanitarium in the interior. If in the opinion of your Government any special measures are required at Aden itself for the comfort of the garrison or for their proper training, I shall be ready to consider them, but His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to withdraw the troops which are required for other purposes at Aden to D’thala, which is nearly a hundred miles from the coast. I shall therefore be glad to learn when Your Excellency in Council has withdrawn to Aden, or, if you think fit, to India, the detach ment now stationed at D’thala, which can he most conveniently effected in the course of the present relief season. 7. I may notice one other argument which is brought forward as a reason for remaining in the Amiri country—namely, the control of the arms traffic. So long as arms can he landed on the coast, no troops that we can employ in the interior will prevent the passage of arms, and I am unable to agree that the Europeans stationed at D’thala can be of any material service in stopping that traffic. 8. The question has also to be considered in its financial aspect. The latest Aden administration report received (for 1904-05) shows the expenditure under the heads respectively of “ Political,” “ Terri torial and Political Pensions,” and “Military,” as Rs. 3,02,014, Rs. 73,775, and Rs. 38,54,091. Doubtless this scale of expenditure has since been reduced in consequence of the termination of the delimitation proceedings, but the figures I have quoted are very greatly in excess of those for the year 1899-1900, when‘the cost under “Political” was Rs. 1,97,826, under “ Territorial and Political Pensions” Rs. 73,383, and under “Military” Rs. 17,62,816. 9 . As regards the Political Officer at D’thala, it was recognised in my Despatch of 4th May that in existing circumstances his immediate withdrawal might he impracticable. This view is confirmed by 'the Despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople of the 7tli August last. But His Majesty’s Government continue of opinion that his retention should be strictly temporary ; and the Political Officer should conduct affairs on that understanding, so as to minimise the effect of his departure when it takes place. In the meantime there is no objection to his discussing, as suggested S. 26. B^ Conor, affairs of secondary importance ■with the local lurkisli authorities when necessary. He should, however, be circumspect in dealing with Letter complaints, and careful not to exaggerate such incidents as may occur. The need for caution is shown by the precipitancy of the action taken on the occasion of the alleged violation of Amiri tern ton Reported in the correspondence termi nating with the Government of India’s Letter of the 2oth December 1904, No. 253. j 0. I must request that no sott of permission or encouragement be given to the extension of any line of railway into the British territory at Aden without my express sanction, and I should like to be informed what steps have been taken by the Ahdali Sultan towards giving any concession lor railway enterprise in his own country. I notice that the commerce of Aden by land has 11. Your Excellency revives the question of the [/ detachment of Aden from the Presidency of Bombay.

Edgerley, K.C.V.O., C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to forward herewith copy of a letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 6956, dated the 12th November 1905, and of its accompaniments, recommending that early steps may be taken to improve the existing track from Nobat Dakim to Dthala, and to convert it into a ■erviceable camel track. The cost has been roughly estimated at Rs. 22,500, of which it is calculated about Rs. 10,000 can be utilised during the current financial year. 2. A serviceable read from Nobat Dakim to Dthala is not only necessary for the sake of our own access to Dthala where a Political Officer is stationed but will attract and develop trade for the railway, the construction of which from Aden to Nobat Dakim is already under consideration {vide correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 2609 E.B.,* dated the 8 th * Pro. No. 20 in July 1905). His Excellency the Governor in Council, therefore, strongly ^'^1905 suppoits the Resident’s recommendation, and I am accordingly to request that^ 0 ®- 17 - 21 . ’ the Government of India may he pleased to accord their sanction to the proposal and to place the necessary funds at the disposal of the Political Resident, Aden, and I am also to ask that any authorisation which may be necessary to employ the Pioneer Regiment now at Dthala on the work may also be given. 3. I am further to request that the sanction of the Government of India, if granted, may he communicated by telegram to enable 1 he services of the Pioneer Regiment at present stationed at Dthala being utilised on the work in question during the present cold season. No. 6956, dated Aden Residency, the 12th November 1905. From—M ajor-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. In reference to the attached copy of a letter No. M.W.-2908, dated the 14th ultimo, addressed by Colonel Scallon to the Secretary to Government in the Public Works Department, I have the honour to very strongly recommend that early sanction may be accorded to the allotment of funds necessary to carry into effect the proposal to at once improve the existing track from N ohat Dakim to Dthala and to convert the same into a really serviceable camel track. 2. It is, I think, most desirable that this work should be undertaken in the course of the present cold weather and even more desirable that use should be made of the favourable opportunity afforded by the presence of a Pioneer Regiment at Aden to undertake a work from which the greatest advantage may he anticipated in the way of a stimulus to the trade of the Protectorate and a general development of our poltical relations with its inhabitants. 3. The improvement of communications in the Aden Protectorate was strongly advocated by the Aden Port Commission in 1901, and also by General Maitland. And now that the demarcation of the boundary has been completed, I would strongly urge that a first step in the desired direction may now be taken as soon as possible. 4. It seems unnecessary to multiply arguments in favour of so obvious a requirement. I attach a copy of a brief Memorandum on the subject recently 5&amp;J6 P. D.2 J submitted by tlie Political Officer, Dthala. The improvement of the track will not of necessity entail further extraordinary measure for its greater security, which is of course for purposes of trade and development lust as essential on the existing track as it will be hereafter. Under present conditions all camel caravans between Dthala and Nobat iJakim have to decend the Khareba pass with lightened loads and with considerable difficulty, whereas on the new track which will go down the Bobat Pass there will be a regular gradient and there will be no dangerous zigzags to be encountered. 6. l am confident that the proposal will tend to considerably increase the trade and prosperity of Aden and its Hinterland, and I therefore venture to hope that the earliest possible sanction may be accorded to the allotment of lunds necessary to carry it into effect.

Report. - Eor about two years a British garrison has been maintained at Dthala. about 100 miles north of Aden, and fortified posts at different stages on the route to Dthala. The security offered by these garrisons and the friendly relations resulting from continuous intercourse with the Arabs is having a most salutary effect on the peace of the interior, within the British sphere, and encouraging an increasing trade with Aden. This good result is greatly retarded by the bad roads and difficult communications, as there is as present only a camel track across the desert to Nobat Dakim at the foot of the moun tains, and from there a narrow track along the beds of shifting streams and of very steep gradients up to the plateau of Dthala. It is hoped that a railway! may before long be constructed across the deser* t Secret^ from Aden to Nobat Dakim and from there a road with satisfactory gradient 8 N Ti 7 - 2 i. ’ to Dthala. The military authorities have now sent a Pioneer regiment to Dthala to form part of the garrison and to assist in improving the communica tions, and it is proposed they should commence at once widening and improving the existing hill track and making small diversions to improve the gradients, leaving all heavy diversions and bridges, etc., for the present, until the detailed plans and estimates required by the Public Works Department Code can be made. The present estimate provide for this preliminary track, most of which will eventually form part of the road. Detail of work. No. MKAStTEEMESTS. L. B. H. Quantities. 1.

From— Major H. F. Jacob, Political Officer, Dthala, To—The First Assistant Resident, Aden. I am sure that from a political point of view a good road from Nobat Dakim to Dthala is an absolute necessity. It is the first step towards ensuring the pacification of the country—and is the most economical method conceivable. A good road will thereafter necessitate adequate protection throughout its length, and I am early submitting a scheme whereby the tribe en route will be interested in securing the protection of caravans in consideration of doles paid into the hands of those actually employed to that end. I refer to the creation of tribal levies. I am further of opinion that a good and properly policed trade route from Dthala to Nobat Dakim will attract the Sanaa (Turkish Yemen) trade hitherto paralyzed by the Turko-Imam disturbances. With such a road much of the produce of Yemen will be diverted from other quarters besides Sanaa. Again with our presence at Dthala we shall be better able to supervise the trend of trade southwards. The road will act as a feeder to the “ Aden-Nobat * Dakim ” railway. (Received on 11th December 1905, with Political Secretary's letter No. 47, dated the 24th November 1905.) CONFIDENTIAL. Sir N.

The track to the camp at Dthala from Nobat Dakim lies through the bed of two or three large dry nullahs, which now and then come down in flood, but it is only in the river beds that cultivation is met with. I have recom mended that Rs. 24,000 be expended by the agency of the Pioneer battalion now at Dthala to improve this road, which will facilitate the passage of camel kafilas bringing grain and hides along this route. Large quantities of hides already come from Yemen down this and the Mavia route through Nobat Dakim to Aden, and this trade would be much improved with increased facilities of transport. 12. We now rise up a pass of some 800 feet altitude on to the Dthala plateau, which is 6,000 feet above sea level and enjoys an excellent climate. During this year only one crop of grain has been produced, and this is dependent on the rainfall and wells. The rainfall last year was 13 inches. Ibis year rain has been more abundant and the crops m &gt;re fertile.13. The Amir of Dthala at a recent interview addressed me with a view to bringing the water of the Wadi Bana into the Dthala plateau, and I have told him that when he lays his propositions before me I will, if I find it feasible, address the Government of India as to sending over an Engineer Officer to elaborate the scheme. - Letter No. 7824, dated 2nd December 1905.

The task of widening 30, and of regrading 15 miles of road through rough and hilly country is one of considerable magnitude; and it is understood that the Bombay Government do not regard as final the small provision of Rs. 22,500 which it is proposed to make. No clear indication is given, however, of the further outlay which may reasonably be expected to become necessary. Recent experience in the construction of roads through hilly tracks on the Northern and North-Western frontiers of India has shewn that unless special care and close scrutiny are exercised in the initial stages of under takings of this kind, there is grave risk of the Government being committed to an expenditure many times exceeding the original estimate of cost. The Government of India think it desirable, therefore, that, before they consider the present proposal, they should have before them a detailed plan and estimate of the work which is now intended.

For more than two years, for political and other reasons a garrison or half a British battalion, a battalion, Native Infantry, and a detachment of Royal Artillery has been maintained at Dthala about 100 miles north of Aden near the boundary of Turkish Yemen, and it will be necessary to maintain some such garrison for a considerable time to come practically permanently. J 3. These troops have hitherto been under canvas, an expensive and unsatis- factory way of housing men for a long period. The communication to Dthala is by camel only ; the first half of the journey across a sandy desert; the second half by a narrow track through the hills along beds of streams and by verv steep zig-zag up to the plateau of Dthala which is about 5,000 feet above the In my letter No. 984, dated 26th August 1904, to the Deputy Adjutant- General, Western Command, I recommend the transfer of the Dthala '■arrison to permanent barracks to be constructed on Jebel Jiliaf about 10 miles from Dthala. Tins cantonment would be about 7,000 feet above the sea and would serve as a hill sanatarium, a most urgent need owing to the trying climate or Aden. I he site of this proposed cantonment was inspected by the Lieutenant-General Commanding on his recent visit to Aden. It is proposed that the communication from Aden to Dthala beino- the main route into the interior by which it is hoped to develop a considerable trade should be a charge against civil funds and the branch from this main road to the cantonment at Jehaf should be a military road. I hope in a short time to forward you a preliminary plan and report on the proposed cantonment at Jebel Jehaf and the branch military road with approximate estimates of the charges against military funds. Whether this military sanatarium is taken in hand at once or not it is most urgently necessary that the communication to Dthala should be improved. It is probable that a railway will be constructed from Aden to Nobat the desert portion of the route and tonga road from there to Dthala. In response to my letter No. 64-C., dated 8th July 1905, a Pioneer battalion has been sent to Dthala for the work on the hill portion of the road and an urgent application is being made to the Government of Bombay to allot civil funds to commence at once with the labour of this Pioneer regiment. It is proposed first to improve the existing track and to make deviations where the gradient is now too great so that it will be the line of the proposed tonga road but leaving all bridges and heavy work till complete plans and estimates as required by the Public Works Department Code can be made. In some places the line of the existing track will have to be left for some miles to get a satisfactory gradient.To lay out this road, etc., requires the whole time of an experienced officer. There is now only one Garrison Engineer in Aden and as the Military Works represents the Public Works Department, it is barely possible with the present Royal Engineer staff to do the work in Aden, and there is no officer available to detach for the work on the proposed road. I consider the matter very urgent as the Pioneer regiment has already arrived at Dthala and will under take the work on very economical terms. I request therefore that a most urgent representation may be made that an officer of Royal Engineers of some works experience may be sent at once to lay out and take charge of the road and afterwards take charge of any works that may be decided on at Dthala or Jebel Jehaf.

Bombay Castle, 24th February 1906. From The Honourable Sir STEYNING W. EDGE RLE K.C.Y.O., C.T.E., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay; To The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT op INDIA, Foreign Department. Sir, I have the honour to refer to Mr. Fraser’s letter No. 2^09-e.b., datefl the 8th July 1905, in which the Government of India expressed their willing ness to consider favourably proposals for the construction by private enterprise of a Railway from Aden into the interior and in paragraphs 4 and 5 of which the conditions thought necessary by the Government of India were stated. In your No. 4417-e,b. , dated the 4th December 1905, were communicated the instructions of the Secretary of State that the views of the Government of India on the whole subject should be laid before him before any steps are taken in connection with offers which may he received. 2. I am therefore now to submit .copies* of the Resident’s further reports which give a sufficient account of the * Letters from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 7093, dated the 19th November 1905, with accompaniments, and No. 7510, dated the 10th December 1905, with accompaniments.

So far as the power of the Sultan to grant a concession is concerned, a doubt as to which is suggested by His Majesty’s Secretary of State, he cannot of course grant a concession which is likely to be attractive to promoters without the concurrence of British authorities as he cannot give a right of entry into Aden and access to the seaboard, but t Aitchison’a Yolumo SI, page 128. Article 9 of the agreement of 1849f does not enable the Resident actually to interfere with the Sultan’s autonomy in his own territories save by friendly advice. The history of his action in this matter, the terms of itre notification recommended, and the present reports of the Political Resident show that procedure by way of advice and negotiation is not free from difficulty. 4. The three main points for consideration if the line is to be made are— (1) whether permission shall be given for the line to enter Aden ; (2) whether any extension of the line beyond Nobat Dakim is to be permitted in the direction of Mavia; (3) whether any extension of the line beyond Nobat Dakim is to be permitted in the direction of D’thala or Jeb.el-Jehaj. On the first of these points there appears to be no reason to refuse permission if the Government of India are prepared to allow the somewhat unusual terms Pol 144—12 which the Sultan desires. For a purely local line in the Sultan’s territories Government is not particularly interested in the terms demanded, but if the line is to enter a British port it is perhaps desirable that the grant of the permission to do so should be used to secure such modification of the conditions as to police, the disposal of civil disputes and matters affecting the safety of any public using the line as may seem to the Government of India to be necessary. The second suggestion is one which His Excellency the Governor in ( ouncil considers it most undesirable at present to discuss. It is very possible '^ ur .^ s wou ^ n °t regard with favour any proposal to make a line in u u- j eD ^ nfcer ^ an ^* but; it is not necessary to consult them as to what is done behind the boundary recently demarcated. Nevertheless a proposal to take the hne even as far as Musemir in the direction suggested need not at present be considered. T The third question of the possibility of an extension towards D # thala or Jebel-Jehaj reallj turns upon the intention of the Government of India in the matter of the establishment of a sanitarium for the Aden Garrison in that neighbourhood. -- 18 f ^ rcons 1 ide 1 ration Aether ifthe line is to enter Aden and even- eontrou/thfi tl ; e terr ! torie 3 whether Abdali or Haushabi under the . , 1 f . the Sl ? ltan of Bahej into those of other Chiefs it would not be desirable to negotiate with the Chiefs for the right of passage of a British hne entirely under British control and then to negotiate with promo ers for its construction and working.

Government of India, Foreign Department, letter No. 2609-e.b., dated 8th July 1905. I have the honour to report in reference to your No. 4528, dated the 20th July 1905, and marginally noted accompaniments, that Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadthl, K.C.S.I., has now agreed to the proposal that a notification shall be published inviting offers for the con struction of a railway from Aden into the interior passing through his territory on the conditions attached to the draft notification herewith enclose . e is willing that these offers shall be invited by the Political Resident of Aden tor recommendation to him and to Government. I have the honour to recommend the early publication of the notification accordingly. 2. The Assistant Commanding Royal Engineer is now actually engaged in drawing up the map asked for in paragraph 2 (2) of your letter under reply and is at present touring within Abdali limits between Dar-Al-Amir and Nobat Dakim for that purpose. The map will be submitted as soon after his return to Aden as possible and meanwhile I submit at once the draft notification embodying the conditions to which Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadthl only finally agreed on the evening oi the 16th instant. 3 . 1 venture to hope that these conditions will meet with the approval of Government, it has been extremely difficult to negotiate them owing to the altogether peculiar terms of the premature agreement which the Sultan entered into with Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers, and particularly owing to the remarkable terms of partnership therein offered to the Sultan s sons. 4 . It will be observed that the conditions considered essential by the Government of India have been included. Others I consider desirable to meet both local and general needs and certain of them are ot course framed to meet the Abdali Sultan’s wishes and aspirations. 5 . As to the first two conditions, I have the honour to recommend that some such period as that of 25 years specified should he fixed within which the right of purchase by Government or the Abdali Sultan should not be exercised. 6 As to the 3rd condition, it is left to the companies concerned to ofler the conditions as to rates and fares which they are willing that Government should be granted for military purposes. I know of one company which would probably be willing to offer a reduction ot £rd on ordinary faies. 7 The 4th and 5th conditions embody the jurisdiction arrangements which the Abdali Sultan is at present willing to accept. I may say that more has been secured than I at first anticipated. 8 . The 6th and 7th conditions I consider desirable and in regard to the 8th I trust that the general principles of management on Indian fctate railways may be considered as suitable as any other. It certain y s 6 et “® necessary that some general principles of management should be specified at the outset. 9 The 10th condition is a valuable concession particularly in the event of the railway being extended, as I trust, it eventually will be, on the other side of Abdali territory.10 . The inh condition calls for no particular comment;. The companies concerned will doubtless offer reasonable personal concessions of the kind referred to m the form of a modicum of free passes, saloon accomoda- tlODj &amp;C., &amp;C # The 12th condition should prove useful in due course of time. 1 l' Aa t0 the 13th condition » the Abdali Sultan derives a very con siderable proportion of his revenue from the transit dues which he has hitherto been allowed to collect, and the present would seem an inopportune time to endeavour to effect a reduction of what is of course a serious imposition on trade. Under treaty the Abdali Sultan can only charge a 2 per cent, ad valorem due on goods belonging to British subjects. And it might at some future date be advantageous to adjust all dues, a large part of which are now more or less arbitrary, upon a regular fixed scale. 12. I would remark for the information of Government that the Abdali Sultan has chosen the present opportunity to suggest an enhancement of the dues which he is under treaty entitled to levy on goods belonging to British subjects. The subject is therefore a delicate one to broach and a most difficult one to satisfactorily deal with. I am on the whole inclined to recommend a general adjustment at a fairly early date which should entail as substantial a reduction as possible of dues on ordinary goods at the cost of as slio-ht an enhancement as possible of dues leviable on goods belonging to British subjects. 13. The total abolition of the dues which is of course most desirable is, 1 fear, impossible, anyhow in the lifetime of the present Sultan and could not certainly be effected without very serious difficulty and probably very heavy expenditure. The collection of dues might be compounded for a laro-e sum of money, the recoupment of which might be arranged for by Government themselves imposing a moderate and regular taxation for a term of years. At present I am not in a position to go into figures. But should Government desire it, 1 will of co^e oiafee arraqgemepts ppU^ct special statistics* 14. Granted the continuance of these dues and that the railway passes as now proposed, through Abdali limits, there should be very considerable profit to the Abdali State from this source alone. And this is of course one of the mam considerations upon which the present Sultan's action has been based. 15. The 14th condition will, I trust, secure necessary facilities for the construction of telegraph and telephone. The adjustment of the charo-es will be a somewhat difficult matter. It will be remembered that in his agreement with Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers the Abdali Sultan secured a separate and distinct profit over this concession. r 16. I would here remark for the information of Government that the percentage guaranteed in that agreement, in regard to both railway and telegraph, was on the gross takings and not on the net profit. The word “gain ” in the English version of that agreement is mislead ing. o n 17 * 15 * h conation will I hope prove most valuable. At first the bultan would not hear of any other arrangement than that he should personally be solely answerable for policing all the line lying within his limits and should be allowed to make whatever arrangement he thought fit. Police management will now be under the control of this Residency and the apportionment of charges can entail a certain proportionate contribution by the Railway Company m accordance with the principles observed on Indian railways. 18. The 16th condition is a modification of the Sultan’s first proposal which it is necessary and on the whole seems harmless to insert. 19. The 17th condition is the most important of all in several respects and upon it really hinges the whole enterprise. Under it land issecured free of rent, the Abdali State is secured a real profit from the railway, and Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadthl can, with the sanction of Government, be secured a personal share of that gain for himself and his sons and lineal descendants, as distinct from his successors in the Sultanate, of which he has openly stated and which most certainly and apparently is the main consideration underlying his consent to and desire for the construction of a railway through his limits. 20. It is improbable that under the 18th condition he will receive from any other firm so extravagant an offer as that made by Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers. The Sultan has himself comparatively little capital to invest tor the purposes of partnership. And it is quite possible that a personal grant to him of a percentage of the net profit of the railway will prove equally tempting and seem to him more probable of actual realization thaa the remark able terms of partnership offered by Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers. 21. I therefore recommend that this condition be allowed and that sanction should be eventually accorded to any reasonable offer made thereunder. 22. In doing this I have the honour to invite consideration of the fact that with a certain proportion of his tribesmen and relations the Sultan will incur some odium over an innovation which at first may prove detrimental to the direct interests of those who gain from the regular traffic of camels between Aden and the interior. I would also invite consideration of the fact that succession to the Sultanate is not in Arabia hereditary but dependent upon a plebiscite of the tribe. 23. It is therefore possible that Sir Ahmed Fadthl’s sons may suffer for the enterprise displayed by their father by the failure of one of them to succeed him upon his death, which he might otherwise have done. 24. I would at all events urge that the personal enterprise displayed by an individual Sultan in the face of that contingency merits special consideration, and I would go so far as to very strongly recommend that if this enterprise is actually now brought to a successful issue, Government should themselves mark their appreciation thereof by the grant of a suitable personal political pension to Sir Ahmed Fadthl and to his private heirs, 25. It is of course with some regret that I have to impress upon Govern ment the fact that personal avarice is one of the strongest features in the character of the present Sultan of the Abdali. But such is undoubtedly the case. And I can only add now in this connection that if Government can authorize me to assure Sir Ahmed Fadthl that upon the successful opening of the railway under reasonable conditions, he and his private heirs will be granted a fairly handsome personal pension in perpetuity, I can then most confidently assure Government that final negotiations will be brought to a prompt and a really satisfactory conclusion. 26. Final negotiations will probably prove more difficult than those now- concluded and the result will very largely depend upon the manner in which Sir Ahmed FadthTs privy purse as distinct from his State exchequer is affected. 27. The possibility of avoiding his territory by an initial digression of the line in the direction of either Amriga on one side or Khanfar on the other has suggested itself to me, but this would entail such serious general political complications that I hesitate to invite serious consideration of the idea. The avoidance of Abdali transit dues would be of course a vast gain to the general trade of the district, but the violent hostility of the Abdali coupled with the difficulties involved in the present non-existence of clearly defined interstatal boundaries would, anyhow at the outset, be pregnant with the possibility of a greater immediate loss. 28. At some future date when interstatal boundaries have been more precisely defined, and should circumstances of an exceptional nature reader such4 a measure for any reason desirable, a digression of the nature indicated might be effected. But at the outset and granted fairly reasonable concessions by the Abdali, I do not recommend the entertainment of such an idea. 29. 1 therefore recommend, for the present consideration of Government, the publication of the present conditions and the grant of all possible concessions to a ruler who, whatever his failings, is at least imbued with a spirit of enter prise much above his fellows and countrymen. 30. I have inserted at present no condition as to compensation being paid for loss actually sustained by any individual landholder or house-holder by the construction of the line. Should Government consider it necessary, I can arrange for its insertion. Ihe point was discussed with the Abdali Sultan, but, as he demurred to the decision in the matter of the amount of the compensation being decided in my Court, it was for the time being dropped. 31. As to the route the line shall follow through the Hinterland, I hope shortly to submit the map showing this and the site of the proposed terminus and stations. For the present I would simply state that local opinion and also the opinion of the Abdali Sultan is very strongly in favour of making Mavia and the fertile distiicts in the vicinity of that place the immediate objective of the railway. 32. This route should, I gather,, tap a maximum of trade and it would have the advantage of avoiding the Amiri, Alawi and Baishi claims to transit duty : the only imposts being Turkish and Haushabi in addition to the Abdali. 33. Finally, I have the honour to recommend that the gauge of the proposed railway shall be either one metre or else the same gauge as the Hedjaz Bailway, 1*05 metres. The Ahdali Sultan would be I think prepared to agree to either. And on the whole I am strongly of opinion that a metre gauge would be best. it would answer all requirements both military and civil and in this respect have a distinct advantage over a smaller gauge. On the other hand a broader gauge is not necessary and would be too expensive. It might be desirable to publish this with the notification, and I would suggest accordingly that a metre gauge should be at once decided upon. 34. I venture to hope that the net result of these preliminary negotiations may be approved of. The draft conditions cover more ground than was contemplated by the Government of India in their letter No. 2609-e.b., dated the 8th July 1905, but will, I trust, eventually be recognized as essential to the proper working of the proposed railway. I he Sultan s consent to them has been gained not without a struggle but without friction. And I have the honour to bring to the notice of Government the services rendered in the matter by my Acting First Assistant, to whose tact and patience the result of these preliminary negotiations is largely due. Draft Notification. Whereas the Government of India are now prepared to consider favourably proposals for the construction of a railway by private enterprise from Aden into the interior of the Aden Protectorate, and whereas Sir Ahmed Fadthl, K.C.b I., Sultan of the Abdali, has expressed his willingness and desire that snch a railway should be constructed through his territory, this is to notify that up to and including the 1st day of April 1906 the Political Resident of Aden is now prepared to consider offers and tenders for the construction of such a line for recommendation to the Abdah Sultan and to the Government of India. The following are the general conditions on which the railway can be constructed and offers should be framed accordingly. (Signed) H. M.

Aden, 16th November 1905. (Signed) F. de B. HANCOCK, ( „ ) AHMED FADTHL MOHSIN. No, 7510, dated the 10th December 1905. From—Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden j The Chief Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay. In continuati n of my letter No. 7093, dated the 19ch November 1905, and as promised in paragraph 2 thereof, I now have the honour to forward the map prepared by the Assistant Commanding Royal Eogineerj Aden Brigade, showing as requested in your letter No. 4528, dated the 20th July 1905, approximately the site of the terminus proposed in Aden and the route the line will follow through the Hinterland up to Nobat Dakim. 2. I attach copy of the Assistant Commanding Royal Engineer’s letter No. 8350, dated the 2nd instant, and of the accompanying report from which the present attitude of the Abdali Sultan will be sufficiently apparent. His views will be further ascertained in due course after those of Government have been received. 3. ^ As to the extension of the line above Nobat Dakim, 1 am of opinion that this will be desirable at as early a date as possible in the direction of Mavia by which the more important caravans of the fertile Taiz District now proceed. In this connection I have the honour to invite reference to paragraphs 23 and 24 of Mr. V itzMauricH s despatch to the Foreign Department of the Govern ment of India, dated Perim, 30th April 1905, and to state that the Political Officer at X) thala has been requested to submit a confidential report in due course upon that actual possibility of any rectification of the border in the yiciuity of Mavia. 4. As to the proposed terminus in Aden, I am of opinion that this should be at Maala and that if possible a public wharf should be constructed near the Aden Goal Company’s Wharf at Hedjuff to which a double line of rail should extend. This pier would be within the 1,200 yards zone of the Hedjuff defences, but would in no way mask the fire thereof. The pier would be right under the defences and could not be reached by an enemy seeking for cover. 5. I pointed .this out tnyself to General Parsons, the Inspector-General of Artillery, on the occasion of his recent inspection of the Aden Defences, and he expressed the opinion thg,t it .could in no way prove detrimental to the defences of Aden. 6. Granted that a good deal of the merchandize imported to Aden consists of skins, coffee, and other goods which require manipulation, I am strongly of opinion, in which the Principal Medical Officer of the District concurs, that this should as far as possible be kept out of the Crater which is already7 congested. And I would therefore propose that building sites should now be freely granted for the reception of merchandize on the vacant space at present existing between Obstruction Pier (near Maala) and the limit of the 1,200 yards zone of the Hedjulf Defences. With a view to improving the sanitation of the Crater, I am of opinion that a good many buildings and store depots there should at an early opportunity be demolished and re-erected on the Maala plain. 7. I would therefore favour no branch line of railway into the Crater except for passenger traffic only between that place and Tawahi. This, I think, might with advantage follow hereafter, but for the present, I am in favour of the railway line terminating near the Aden Coal Company’s ground under the Hedjuff defences. 8. My proposals would have the effect of to some extent relieving existing congestion in the Crater and of avoiding the increased congestion which would be caused by railway buildings and sidings there. 9. I would lay particular stress upon the point that the extension of the railway as far as Hedjuff would entail comparatively trifling expense as compared to the heavy cost of dredging a large channel to Maala by which means alone the existing wharf there would be made accessible to steamers. The extra dredging which would be necessary to make a public wharf at Hedjuff accessible to large vessels would be comparatively little. 10. Whilst I am strongly in favour of a public wharf at Hedjuff in direct railway communication with the interior and directly accessible to cargo vessels without the troublesome and expensive intervention of private owned caro-o boats and lighters, I am not in favour of the proposal that cargo should be brought on to the Tawahi Keolamation. The Tawahi Division of the Settlement has hitherto proved healthy and I am opposed to any scheme which would entail its congestion with a large cooly population. 11. I would point out that both the railway terminus and the store depots and other buildings above projected would have the protection of the Mansuri Ridge and of the°Hedjuff defences in the event of an attack on Aden, whereas in the event of a determined attack being made on the Crater, all buildings there would probably have to be abandoned. 12. In conclusion, I can only urge with a view to the success of the projected radway and the general trade development of the Settlement of Aden that the earliest possible action should be taken to secure as liberal a modification as possible of the restrictions contained in Rules 3 and 4 of those issued under Section 13 of the Aden Settlement Regulation Vll of 1900 and published in Government Notification No. 6938-a., dated the 15th October 1903, at page 1370—1375 of the Bothbxy Government Part I, dated the 29th October 1903. I am ot opinion that the future progress and prosperity of Aden very largely depend upon the extent to which the Maala plain can hereafter be utilized for building purposes. Nc. 3350, dated the 2nd December 1905. From— Lieut.-Colonel R. Leigh, R. E„ Assistant Commanding Royal Engineer, Aden Brigade; To—The First Assistant Resident, Aden. In reply to your No. 6141, dated the 9th October 1905, 1 forward herewith a report and tracing on the proposed railway to Nobat Dakim. His Highness the Sultan of Lahej sent a representative “Husain Bin” (Musabain ?) to show me the line he proposed lor the railway. I went over the whole country and considered the line proposed by the Sultan—the one now shown in the plan would probablybe the best j the only alteration I proposed in the Saltan’s plan was to cross the Wadi As Saghir a little more to the south. Husain Bin (Musabain ?) informed me that the Saltan had quite determined that the line should not go through any of the cultivated land round El Hauta and therefore must be kept at some distance. On completing my inspection I called on the Sultan and informed him that I in the main agreed with his proposal—he then at once said that he changed his mind and wished the Railway to run close El Hauta j he afterwards added that it must not run through any cultivated land, but must run on the embankments between the fields. I pointed out that this was impossible as the turns round the fields were much too quick : he afterwards stated he wished it to go quite outside the Lahej cultivation. During the interview I formed the opinion that it will not be difficult to get the Sultan to agree almost to any location considered advisable. The only thing he seemed inclined to insist on was that there must be a station at Dar-Al-Amir where the line enters his territory. Proposed railway from Aden to Nobat Dakim, The country north of Aden is for the most part sandy desert up to the foot of the hills at Nobat Dakim, which is about 900 feet above sea level. From Nobat Dakira the mountains rise steeply to about 7,800 feet at Jebel«Jehaff the limit of territory under British protection about 40 miles north of Nobat Dakim. The hill country is bare rocky mountain with only a little cultivation at the bottoms of the valleys and the rivers are in consequence liable to very heavy floods. The principal river in this district is the Tiban which, rising to the north-east of D’thala, flows round Jebel-Jehaff taking the drainage of a large extent of Turkish country, passes Musemir and enters the desert at Nobat Dakim. Opposite Nobat Dakim the river flows in a gorge about 150 yards wide and 30 to 40 feet deep with almost vertical banks : in ordinary times it is a small stream 15 to 20 yards wide and to 2 feet deep—in heavy fl jods the whole gorge may be filled with a rapid torrent 6 to 8 feet deep. About 2 miles south of Zaida the Tiban divides the western branch—much the larger being called Alkabir and the eastern As Saghir. Wadi A1 Khabir opposite Lahej is a gorge about 150 yards wide with vertical clay banks about 20 feet high and subject to much the same floods as at Nobat. Below this it rapidly diminished till at Al Ahmad. There are several small channels in the sand 5 to 10 yards wide and only heavy floods reach so far. The Wadi As Saghir to the east of Lahej is smaller than the Wadi Al Khabir and opposite Lahej is about 100 yards wide and about 12 to 15 feet deep in clay. This gorge soon disappears opposite Bir Said Ali—it divides into several streams and most of the water is taken for irrigating the wide valley there —opposite Fiyush the valley is a wide depression with small channels and small drains to irrigate a width of 2 miles of country. Near Bir Jabir there are small channels in the sand often filled with drifting sand only heavy floods reach the part of the valley east of Imad. In the fork between these streams is El Hauta, the capital of Lahej. The country here is clayey sand covered with millet from just below the fork of the streams to about 2 miles south of El Hauta and extending east and west to the banks of the two rivers. This district is covered with irrigation channels and banks round the irrigated fields many of the channels have cut deeply into the clay 8 or 10 feet deep. West of the Tiban and Wadi Al Khabir, the country from Nobat to nearly opposite As ISaghir, is hard gravelly sand covered with boulders—below this to the sea it is mostly loose sand. The Wadi Abram is a wide valley about a mile wide opposite Waht a sandy depression 15 to 20 feet below the rest of the desert with small channels 5 to 19 yards wide, the water only occasionally coming as far as opposite Al Waht in heavy floods. The ground at Nobat is hard gravel with boulders and occasionally rock. The river Bileb emerges from the mountain from the north-east at Nooat—it is a gravelly nullah 50 to 60 yards wide and 4 or 5 feet deep covered with boulders. It is quite dry except in times of flood. Near El Anad it turns to the west and enters the Tiban in a stream about 100 yards wide and 3 or 4 feet deep in heavy floods. The valley of the Bileh runs to the south-east from El Anad but it is stopped at its north end and the river has not run in the valley for over 50 years. This is a deep sandy valley with no stream except in heavy rain and then very small and soon disappearing in the sand.9 The ground between Wadi As Saghir and Wadi Bileh is sand—mostly hard on the west side and loose sand near the Bileh. On the east o! the Wadi Bileh is a steep slope of loose sand in parts about 100 feet high and beyond that a large extent of loose sand—the steep slope towards the Bileh being apparently formed by sand blown over. Course of railway. It is considered inadvisable to locate the railway west of the Wadi A1 Khabir and Tiban. The only advantage would be that from opposite Waht to opposite Nobat Dakim it would be very cheaply constructed—as it would cross no stream—would run along land with an even slope without valleys or hills, very little excavation would be wanted—stone can be obtained nearly all along the route and the river is near for supplying water to the working parties. But it would run entirely through the desert at a distance from villages and cultivation— and it would run a long way from A1 Hauta and on the other side of the large Wadi A1 Khabir. It would be on the wrong side of the river at Nobat and from north of Zaida would run through the land of a tribe not friendly, A line running close to A1 H&amp;uta which is, if possible, very desirable as A1 Hauta is the only large town on the route would run through 8 or 10 miles of cultivated land and on emerging from this would be between two large Wadis subject to heavy floods and necessitating a large bridge. The Sultan of Labej is very averse to taking a strip of land through the cultivated country. On the whole the line shown on the plan seems advisable. A station at Dar A1 Amir is specially required by the Sultan of Lahej as it is the first place in his territory. A station near Fiyush —cross the Wadi As Saghir north of Fiyush where it is small and the railway will be mostly on a small embankment and then running north-west near the east of Wadi As Saghir. Another station might be near Zaida. From Nobat further extension would probably eventually be up the Tiban Valley— there seems to be no difficulty in reaching at any rate Musemir—above that the country is not well enough known to give any opinion. In Aden it is suggested a station should be located south-west of Maala and a small branch line run to Maala Wharf. From Maala the best line seems to be to tunnel under the hill and run out through the small isthmus. Stations are also proposed at Khormaksar and Sheikh Othman. It would be a great convenience to extend the line from Maala to Steamer Point, which can be done by running the line on the north side of the main road with a terminus on the newly reclaimed land at Tawahi.

I attach copy of the Assistant Commanding Eoyal Engineer’s letter No. 3350, dated the 2nd instant, and of the accompanying report from which the present attitude of the Abdali Sultan will be sufficiently apparent. His views will be further ascertained in due course after those of Government have been received. 3. As to the extension of the line above Nobat-Hakim, I am of opinion that this will be desirable at as early a date as possible in the direction of Alavia by which the more important caravans of the fertile Taiz district now proceed. In this connection I have the honour to invite reference to paragraphs 23 and 24 of Mr. Ebzmaurice’s despatch* to the Foreign Department of t ^ ie , Enrlo to Government of India, dated Perim, 39th April 1995, and to state that the Pr0 No al 2 Political Officer at D'thala has been requested to submit a confidential report in due course upon that actual possibility of any rectification of the border in Nog 7 301 . 345 . the vicinity of Mavia. 4. As to the proposed terminus in Aden, I am of opinion that this should be at Maala, and that, if possible, a public wharf should be constructed near the Aden Coal Company’s wharf at Hedjuff, to which a double line of rail should extend. This pier would be within the 1,20 j yards zone of the Hedjutf Defences, but would in no way mask the fire thereof. The pier would be right under the defences, and could not be reached by an enemy seeking for cover. 5 I pointed this out myself to General Parsons, the Inspector-General of Artillery, on the occasion of his recent inspection of the Aden Defences, and he expressed the opinion that it could in no way prove detrimental to the defences of Aden. 6 . Granted that a good deal of the merchandize imported to Aden consists of skins, coffee, and other goods, which require manipulation, I am strongly of opinion/ in which the Principal Medical Officer of the District concurs, that this should as far as possible.be kept out of the Crater which is already con gested. And I would, therefore, propose that building sites should now be freelv ^ranted for the reception of merchandize on the vacant space at present existing between Obstruction Pier (near Maala), and the limit of the 1,200 yards zone of the Hedjuff Defences. With a view to improving the sanitation of the Crater, lam of opinion that a good many buildings and store depdts there should, at an early opportunity, be demolished and re-erected on the Maala plain. 7. I would, therefore, favour no branch line of railway into the Crater, except for passengers traffic only, between that place and Tawahi. This, I think, might with advantage follow hereafter, but for the present^ I am in favour of the railway line terminating near the Aden Coal Company’s ground under the Hedjuff Defences. 8 . M y proposals would have the effect of to some extent relieving existing congestion in the Crater, and of avoiding the increased congestion which would be caused by railway buildings and sidings there. 9 . I would lay particular stress upon the point, that the extension of the railway, as far as Hedjuff, would entail comparatively trifling expense as com pared to the heavy cost of dredging a large channel to Maala, by which means alone the existing wharf there would be made accessible to steamers. The extra dredging which would be necessary to make a public wharf at Xledjutf accessible to large vessels would be comparatively little.10. Whilst I am strongly in favour of a public wharf at Hedjuff, in direct railway communication with the interior, and directly accessible to cargo vessels without the troublesome and expensive intervention of private owned cargo boats and lighters I am not in favour of the proposal that cargo should be brought on to the Tawahi reclamation. The Tawahi Division of the Settle ment has hitherto proved healthy, and 1 am opposed to any scheme which would entail its congestion with a large cooly population. 11. I would point out that, both the railway terminus and the store derdis and other buildings above projected, would have the protection of the Mansuri Ridge, and of the Hedjuff Defences in the event of an attack on Aden, whereas in the event of a determined attack being made on the Crater, all buildings there would probably have to be abandoned. 12. In conclusion I can only urge, with a view to the success of the pro jected railway, and the general trade development of the Settlement of Aden, that the earliest possible action should be takeu to secure as liberal a modifica tion as possible of the restrictions contained in rules 3 and 4 of those issued under section 13 of the Aden Settlement Regulation, VII of 1901, and pub lished in Government ^ otification No. 6938-A., dated the 15th October 1903, at pages 1370-1375 of the Bombay Government Gazette&gt; Part I, dated 29th October 1903. I am of opinion that the future progress and prosperity of Aden very largely depend upon the extent to which the Maala plain can hereafter he utilized for building purposes. ^ • No. 7511, dated Aden Residency, the 10th December 1905. Memorandum by the Political Resident, Aden. Advance copy, with its accompaniment, forwarded, with compliments, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Poreign Department, Simla. No. 3350, dated Aden, the 2nd December 1905. Irom — Lieuntenant-Colonel R. Leigh, R.E., Assistant Commanding Koyal Engineer, Aden Brigade, To—The F.rst Assistant Resident, Aden. In reply to your No. 6141, dated 9th October 1905, I forward herewith a report and tracing on the proposed railway to Nobat-Dakim. His Highness the Sultan of Lahej sent a representative, ‘Husain bin* (Musabain?) to show me the line he proposed for the railway. I went over the whole country, and considered the line proposed by the Sultan—the one now shew n in the plan—would probably be the best; the only alteration I proposed in the Sultan’s plan was to cross the Wadi As Saghira little more to the south. Husain Bin (Musabain ?) informed me that the Sultan had quite determined that the line should not go through any of the cultivated land round El Hauta, and, therefore, must be kept at some distance. On completing my inspection, I called on the Sultan, and informed him that 1, in the main, agreed with his proposal; he then at once said that he had changed his mind, and wished the railway to run close to El Hauta; he after wards added that it, must not run through any cultivated land, but must run on the embankments between the fields. I pointed out that this was impossible, as the turns round the fields were much too quick : he afterwards stated that he wished it to go quite outside the Lahej cultivation. During the interview, I formed the opinion that it will not be difficult to get the Sultan to agree almost to any location considered advisable. The only thing he seemed inclined to insist on was, that there must be a station at Dhar Al Amir, where the line enters his territory.3 Proposed Railway from Aden to Nobat-Dakim. The country north of Aden is for the most part sandy desert up to the foot of the hills at Nobat-Dakim, which is about 900 feet above sea level. From Nobat-Dakim the mountains rise steeply to about 7,800 feet at Jebel Jehaff—the limit of territory under British Protection about 40 miles north of Nobat-Dakim. The hill country is bare rocky mountain, with only a little cultivation at the bottoms of the valleys, and the rivers are in consequence liable to very heavy floods. The principal river in this district is the Tiban, which rising to the north east of D’thala, flows round Jebel Jehaff—taking the drainage of a large extent of Turkish country—passes Musemir, and enters the desert at Nobat-Dakim. Opposite Nobat-Dakim the river flows in a gorge about 150 yards wide, and 30 to 40 feet deep, with almost vertical banks ; in ordinary times it is a small stream 15 to 20 yards wide and 1J to 2 feet deep, in heavy floods the whole gorge may be filled with a rapid torrent 6 to 8. feet deep. About 2 miles south of Zaida the Tiban divides, the western branch, much the larger, being called Alkabir, and the eastern As Saghir. 'VYadi A1 Khaitir, opposite Lahej, is a gorge about 150 yards wide with vertical clay banks about 20 feet high and subject to much the same floods as at Nobat. Below this it rapidly diminished till at A1 Ahmad. There are several small channels in the sand 5 to 10 yards wide, and only heavy floods reach so far. The Wadi As Saghir, to the east of Lahej, is smaller than the 'Wadi A1 Khabir, and opposite Lahej is about 100 jards wide, and about 12 to 15 feet deep in clay. This gorge soon disappears—opposite Bir-Said-Ali it divides into several streams, and most of the water is taken for irrigating the wide valley there—opposite Fiyush the valley is a wide depression with small channels, and small drains to irrigate a width of two miles of country. Near Bir Jabir there are small channels in the sand often filled with drifting sand. Only heavy floods reach the part of the valley east of Imad. In the fork between these streams is El Hauta, the capital of Lahej. The country here is clayey sand, covered with millet, from just below the fork of the streams, to about two miles south of El Hauta, and extending east and west to the banks of the two rivers This district is covered with irrigation channels, and banks round the irrigated fields—many of the channels have cut deeply into the clay—8 or 10 feet deep. West of the Tiban and Wadi A1 Khabir the country from Nobat to nearly opposite As Saghir is hard, gravelly sand covered with boulders—below this to the sea it is mostly loose sand. The Wadi Abram is a wide valley about a mile wide opposite Waht—a sandy depression 15 to 20 feet below the rest of the desert with small channels 5 to 10 yards wide—the water only occasionally coming as far as opposite Al Waht in heavy floods. The ground at Nobat is hard gravel with boulders, and occasionally rock. The river Bileh emerges from the mountain from the north-east of Nobat—it is a gravelly nullah 50 to 60 yards wide, and 4 or 5 feet deep, covered with boulders. It is quite dry, except in times of flood. Near El Anad it turns to the west, and enters the Tiban in a stream about 100 yards wdde and 3 or 4 feet deep in heavy floods. The valley of the Bileh runs to the south-east from El Anad, but it is stopped at its north end, and the river has not run in the valley for over 50 years. This is a deep, sandy valley with no stream except in heavy rain, and then very small and soon disappearing in the sand. The ground between Wadi As Saghir and Wadi Bileh is sand, mostly hard on the west side and loose sand near the Bileh. On the east of the Wadi Bileh is a steep slope of loose sand in parts about 100 feet high and beyond that a large extent of loose sand—the steep slope towards the Bileh being apparently formed by sand blown over. Course of Railway .—It is considered inadvisable to locate the railway west of the Wadi Al Khabir and Tiban. The only advantage would be that from opposite Waht to opposite Nobat-Dakim ; it would be very cheaplyconstructed, as it would cross no stream, would run alons: land with an even slope without valleys or hills, very little excavation would be wanted—stone can be obtained nearly all along the route, and the river is near for supplying water to the working parties. But it would run entirely through the desert, at a distance from villages and cultivation, and it would run a long way from A1 Hauta, and on the other side of the large Wadi A1 Khabir. It would be on the wrong side of the river at Nobat, and from north of Jaida would run through the land of a tribe not friendly. A line running close to A1 Ilauta, which is, if possible, very desirable, as A1 Hauta is the only large town on the route, would run through 8 or 10 miles of cultivated land, and on emerging from this would be between two large Wadis, subject to heavy floods, and necessitating a large bridge. The Sultan of Lahej is very averse to taking a strip of land through the cultivated country. On the whole the line shewn on the plan seems advisable. A station at Dar A1 Amir, specially required by the Sultan of Lahej, as it is the first place in his territory. A station near Fiyush, cross the Wadi As Sighir north of Eiyush, where it is small, and the railway will be mostly on a small embankment, and then running north-west near the east of Wadi As Saghir. Another station might be near Zaida. From Nobat further extension would probably, eventually, be up the Tibban valley. There seems to be no difficulty in reaching, at any rate, Musemir—above that, the country is not well enough known to give any opinion. In Aden it is suggested that a station should be located south-west of Maala, and a small branch line run to Maala Wharf. From Maala the best line seems to be to tunnel under the hill, and run out through the Small Isthmus. Stations are also proposed at Khormaksar and Sheikh Othman.

B. LFIGH, Lieut. Col. R.K, Assistant Commanding Loyal Engineer, Aden Brigade.From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to report in reference to your No. 4528, dated the 20th Yonr letter to Government of India, No. 2571, * 1005, and maximally noted aCCOHl' railway from Aden into the interior passing through his territory, on the condi tions attached to the Draft Notification herewith enclosed, lie is willing that these offers shall be invited by the Political Resident of Aden for recommenda tion to him and to Government. And I have the honour to recommend the early publication of the notification accordingly. 2. The Assistant Commanding Royal Engineer is now actually engaged in drawing up the map asked for in paragraph 2(2) of your letter under reply, and is at present touring within Abdali limits between Dar-Al- Amir and IS obat l)akim for that purpose. The map will be submitted as soon after his return ^ to Aden as possible, and meanwhile I submit at once the Draft Notification embodying the conditions to which Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadthl only finally agreed on the evening of the 16th instant. 3. I venture to hope that these conditions will meet with the approval of Government. It has been extremely ditficult to negotiate them owing to the altogether peculiar terms of the premature agreement which the Sultan entered into with M essrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers, and particularly owing to the remarkable terms of partnership therein offered to the Sultan s sons. 4. It will be observed that the conditions considered essential by the Government of India have been included. Others I consider desirable to meet both local and general needs, and certain of them are of course framed to meet the Abdali Sultan’s wishes and aspirations. 5. As to the first two conditions, I have the honour to recommend that some such period as that of 25 years specified should be fixed within which the right of purchase by Government or the Abdali Sultan should not be 6. As to the third condition it is left to the companies concerned to offer the conditions as to rates and fares which they are willing that G o\ ernment should be granted for Military purposes. I know of one company which would probably be willing to offer a reduction of l-3rd on ordinary fares. 7. The 4th and 5th conditions embody the jurisdiction arrangements which the Abdali Sultan is at present willing to accept. I may say that more has been secured than I at first anticipated. 8. The 6th and 7th conditions I consider desirable and in regard to the 8th I trust that the general principles of management on Indian State Railways may be considered as suitable as any other. It certainly seems necessary that some general principles of management should be specified at the outset. 9. The 10th condition is a valuable concession particularly in the event of the railway being extended, as I trust, it eventually will be, on the other side of Abdali territory. 10. The 11th condition calls for no particular comment. The companies concerned will doubtless offer reasonable personal concessions of the kind referred to in the form of a modicum of free passes, saloon accommodation, etc., etc. * The 12th condition should prove useful in due course of time. 11. As to the 13th condition, the Abdali Sultan derives a very consider able proportion of his revenue from the transit dues which he has hitherto been allowed to collect, and the present would seem an inopportune time to endeavour to effect a reduction of what is of course a serious imposition of trade. Under treaty the Abdali Sultan can only charge a two per cent. &lt;xd valorem due on dated 22nd April 1905. f Government of India, Foreign Department, letter No. 2009 E.-D., dated 8th July 1905. • No. 19 in S. E., Ang. 1906, No*. 17-21. t Pro. no. 20 in ibii. paniments, that Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadthl, K.C.S.I., has now agreed to the proposal that a notification shall be published inviting offers for the construction of a exercised.4 goods belonging to British subjects. And it might at some future date be advantageous to adjust all dues a large part of which are now more or less arbitrary, upon a regular fixed scale. 12. I would remark for the information of Government that the Abdali Sultan has chosen the present opportunity to suggest an enhancement of the dues which he is under treaty entitled to levy on goods belonging to British subjects. The subject is therefore a delicate one to broach and a most difficult one to satisfactorily deal with. I am, on the whole, inclined to recommend a general adjustment at a fairly early date which should entail as substantial a reduction as possible of dues on ordinary goods at the cost of as slight an enhancement as possible of dues leviable on goods belonging to British subjects. 13. The total abolition of the dues which is of course most desirable, is, I fear, impossible, anyhow in the life-time of the present Sultan, and could not certainly be effected without very serious difficulty and probably very heavy expenditure. The collection of dues might be compounded for a large sum of money the recoupment of which might be arranged for by Government themselves imposing a moderate and regular taxation for a term of years. At present 1 am not in a position to go into figures. But, should Government desire it, I will of course make arrangements to collect special statistics. 14. Granted the continuance of these dues and that the railway passes as now proposed, through Abdali limits, [there should be very considerable profit to the Abdali State from this source alone. And this is of course one of the main considerations upon which the present Sultan’s action has been based. 15. The 14th condition will, I trust, secure necessary facilities for the construction of telegraph and telephone. The adjustment of the charges will be a somewhat difficult matter. It will be remembered that in his agreement with Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers the Abdali Sultan secured a separate and distinct profit over this concession. 16. I would here remark, for the information of Government, that the percentage guaranteed in that agreement, in regard to both Railway and Tele graph, was on the gross takings and not on the net profit. The word “ gain ” in the English version of that agreement is misleading. 17. The 15th condition will I hope prove most valuable. At first the Sultan would not hear of any other arrangement than that he should personally be solely answerable for policing all the line lying within his limits, and should be allowed to make whatever arrangement he thought fit. Police management will now be under the control of this Residency, and the apportionment of charges can entail a certain proportionate contribution by the Railway Company in accordance with the principles observed on Indian Railways. 18. The 16th condition is a modification of the Sultan’s first proposal which it is necessary and on the whole seems harmless to insert. 19. The 17th condition is the most important of all in several respects, and upon it really hinges the whole enterprise. Under it land is secured free of rent, the Abdali State is secured p a real profit from the railway, and Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadthl can, with the sanction of Government, be secured a personal share of that gain for himself and his sons and lineal descendants, as distinct from his successors in the Sultante, of which he has openly stated and which most certainly and apparently is the main consideration underlying his consent to and desire for the construction of a railway through his limits. 20. It is improbable that under the 18th condition he will receive from any other firm so extravagant an offer as that made by Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers. The Sultan has himself comparatively little capital to invest for the purposes of partnership. A%d it is quite possible that a person al grant to him of a percentage of the net profit of the railway will prove equally tempting and seem to him more probable of actual realization than the remarkable terms of partnership offered by Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers. 21. I therefore recommend that this condition be allowed, and that sane* tion should be evntually accorded to any reasonable offer made thereunder.111) 5 22. In doing this I have the honour to invite consideration of the fact that with a certain proportion of his tribesmen and relations the Sultan will incur some odium over an innovation which at first may prove detrimental to the direct interests of those who gain from the regular traffic of camels between Aden and the Interior. _ I would also invite consideration of the fact that succession to the Sultanate is not in Arabia hereditary but dependent upon a plebiscite of the Tribe. 1 23. It is therefore possible that Sir Ahmed Eadthl’s sons may suffer for enterprise displayed by their father by the failure of one of them to succeed him upon his death, which he might otherwise have done. 24. I would at all events urge that the personal enterprise displayed by an individual Sultan in the face of that contingency merits special consideration, and I would go so far as to very strongly recommend that if this enterprise is actually now brought to a successful issue, Government should themselves mark their appreciation thereof by the grant of a suitable personal political pension to Sir Ahmed Fadthl and to his private heirs. 25. It is of course with some regret that I have to impress upon Government the fact the personal avarice is one of the strongest features in the character of the present Sultan of the Abdali. But such is undoubtedly the case. And I can only add now in this connection that if Government can authorise me to assure Sir Ahmed hadthl that upon the successful opening of the railway under reasonable conditions, he and his private heirs will be granted a fairly handsome personal pension in perpetuity. I can then most confidently assure Government that final negotiations will be brought to a prompt and 'a really satisfactory conclusion. 26. Final negotiations will probably prove more difficult than those now concluded and the result will very largely depend upon the manner in which Sir Ahmed Fadthl’s privy purse as distinct from his State exchequer is affected. 27. The possibility of avoiding his territory by an initial digression of the line in the direction of either Amriga on one side or Khanfar on the other has suggested itself to me, but this would entail such serious general political complications that I hesitate to invite serious consideration of the idea. The avoidance of Abdali transit dues would be of course a vast gain to the general trade of the district, but the violent hostillity of the Abdali coupled with the difficulties involved in the present non-existence of clearly defined interstatal boundaries would, anyhow at the outset, be pregnant with the possibility of a greater immediate loss. 28. At some future date when interstatal boundaries have been more precisely defined, and should circumstances of an exceptional nature render such a measure for any reason desirable, a digression of the nature indicated might be effected. But at the outset and granted fairly reasonable concessions by the Abdali, I do not recommend the entertainment of such an idea. 29. I therefore recommend for the present consideration of Government the publication of the present conditions and the grant of all possible concessions to a ruler who, whatever his failings, is at least imbued with a spirit of enterprise much above his fellows and countrymen. 30. I have inserted at present no condition as to compensation being paid for loss actually sustained by any individual landholder or householder by the construction of the line. Should Government consider it necessary, I can arrange for its insertion. The point was discussed with the Ahdali Sultan but, as he demurred to the decision in the matter of the amount of the com pensation being decided in my Court it was for the time being dropped. 31. As to the route the lane shall follow through the Hinterland I hope shortly to submit the map showing this and the site of the proposed terminus and stations. For the present J would simply state that local opinion and also the cpinion of the Ahdali Sultan is very strongly in favour of making Mavia and the fertile districts in the vicinity of that place the immediate objective of the railway. 82. This route should, I gather, tap a maximum of trade and it would have the advantage of avoiding the Amiri, Alawi and Baishi claims to transit6 duty : the only imposts being Turkish and Haushabi in addition to the Abdali. 33. Finally, I have the honour to recommend that the guage of the proposed railway shall be either one metre or else the same guage as the Hedjaz railway 1-05 metres. The Abdali Sultan would be, I think, prepared to agree to either. And, on the whole, I am strongly of opinion that a metre guage would ^ be best. j It would answer all requirements both military and civil and in this respect have a distinct advantage over a smaller guage. On the other hand, a broader gauge is not necessary and would be too expensive. It might be desirable to publish this with the notification and I would suggest accordingly that a metre gauge should be at once decided upon. 34 . I venture to hope that the net result of these preliminary negotiations may be approved of. Ihe draft conditions cover more ground than was contem plated by the Government of India in their letter No. 2609-E.A.,* dated the 8th*No. 20 m July 1905, but will, I trust, eventually be recognised as essential to the proper^-, w working of the proposed railway. The Sultan’s consent to them has been gained 17 . 2 !. ° 8 ’ not without a struggle but without friction, and I have the honour to bring to the notice of Government the services rendered in the matter by my Acting First Assistant to whose tact and patience the result of these preliminary negotiations is largely due. DRAFT NOTIFICATION. Whereas the Government of India are now prepared to consider favourably proposals for the construction of a railway by private enterprise from Aden into the interior of the Aden Protectorate and whereas Sir Ahmed Fadthl, K.C.S.I., Sultan of the Abdali has expressed his willingness and desire that such a railway should be constructed through his territory, this is to notify that up to and including the 1st day of April 1906 the Political liesident of Aden is now prepared to consider offers and tenders for the construction of such a line for recommendation to the Abdali Sultan and to the Government of India.

Major-General Mason to India Office. Sir, Aden Residency, May 7, 1905. I HAVE the honour to forward herewith copy of Mr. Fitzmaurice’s despatch dated Perim, the 30th April last, on the Subaihi border and the north-east frontier, addressed to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, together with a copy of my forwarding letter dated the 7th instant.

Sir, ' Aden Residency, May 7, 1905. I HAVE the honour to transmit the Report by Mr. Fitzmaurice of the 30th April on the Subaihi border and north-east. 2. With regard to his remarks on Beda, paragraphs 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, I beg to point out that I have been and am now taking steps to induce the Chief of that tribe to enter into the Treaty sanctioned by Government. I understand one of the main obstacles in the past has been the local jealousies amongst the Beda Chief and minor Sheikhs, which I trust however to. be able to overcome, and I am not without hope that within a reasonable time Ifiat the Treaty in question will be concluded, unless perhaps the present troubles in Yemen should have a disturbing effect on the British side of the border. A fuller report on the subject will follow by next mail. 3. The settlement of the south-west border (Suhaihi) appears to me to be satisfactory, whilst it has also been a great advantage to have the north-east line put in principle on a more definite basis. By the wording of the proces-verbal Mr. Fitzmaurice has not expressly recognized Juban as Turkish, and to a certain extent this would seem to leave the matter open, should the claims of Yafa’ and the general circumstances of the case, in the event of any future demarcation of the north-east boundary, render it expedient to insist on its Yafa’ connection. I would also venture to point out that the words “ at the moment of demarcation ” in the proces-veibal, would appear to be a certain limitation on our cession of the Subaihi territory between the boundary actually delimited and the Akama-Kudam line. 4. In forwarding the last Boundary Commission Report by Mr. Fitzmaurice, I beg to place on record my appreciation of the good work he has done in connection [•2040 2—11 Bwith the boundary. Apart from his actual services in connection with demarcation, I have always found him ready to help me with his advice and experience in many matters which 1 have consulted him on, and that his assistance as the result of his long experience in the hinterland has been .of much value to me. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. M. MASON, Major-General, Political Resident, Aded. Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Mr. Fitzmaurice to Government of India. Perim, April 30, 1905. IN accordance with the Government of India’s instructions, conveyed to me in the British Ambassador’s telegram of the 18th instant, E have, as reported in my telegram of the 20th instant, settled with the Turkish Commissioner the outstanding portion of some 60 miles of the south-west frontier of theSubehi, as also the questions expressly included in the recent negotiations with the Turks respecting the north-east boundary-line to the desert I forward herewith the maps (^-inch to the mile, general map, and 40000 larg e scale map of the Sheikh Said Peninsula) with the boundary line marked thereon, as also a detailed description of this section of the frontier, all duly signed by Colonel Mustapha Remzi, the Ottoman Commissioner. This brings up the total extent of boundary actually delimited with the Turks to about 200 miles from point I on the Wadi Bana to Husn Murad at Sheikh Said. 2. I further inclose the signed proces-verbal in French (with a translation in English) of the last official meeting of the Joint Commission. In it will be found mentioned the arrangement communicated by the Sublime Porte in a note verbale, dated the 14th March last, to His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople concerning the undertaking given by the Ottoman Government not to alienate to a third Power the Subehi territory lying between the line actually delimited from J. Numan to Husn Murad and the line of the old Subehi border from J. ’Akama through J. ’Akkar to Kudam on the shore of the Bed Sea. 3. The wording of the Porte’s note is vague in not giving the north-western limits (i.e., ’Akaraa and Kudam) of the territory to which the non-alienation Agree ment refers, but I understand the British Ambassador has subsequently obtained from the Sublime Porte a statement in writing indicating more precisely the territory to which the arrangement refers. ( Vide Secretary of State for India’s telegram of the 4th April to the Government of India, Foreign Department.) 4. The tenour of the official telegram on the subject from the Ottoman Minister of War to the Turkish Commissioner, dated the 19th March, 1905, was as follows :— “The British Government has wished to impose a condition that the Imperial Government shall never cede to a third Power the territory situated between the Akama-Kudam line and the second line terminating at Husn Murad, which you are hereby instructed to delimit. Such a condition could not be deemed worthy of discussion even, but the Ottoman Ambassador in London has made a communication concerning the territory adjoining the Husn Murad line which the British Foreign Minister has accepted as a sufficient pledge on the subject.” When urged to insert in the proces-verbal the \Aords “Akama and Kudam,’ as the northern limits of the territory in question, the Turkish Commissioner demurred, saying that, in view of the above instructions, he could only agree to the mention of “ the territory adjoining the Murad line,” and that the reference might even be to the territory to the south of that line. He subsequently agreed to the wording, “adjoining and to the north of the Numan-Murad line.” 5. With regard to the section of the Subehi border from J. Numan to Husn Murad, as finally drawn on the accompanying maps, it may be remarked that the Boundary Commission, on entering the Subehi country, was given to understand that the western Subehi frontier passed by J. Am Missas and thence skirted the southern slopes of the hills, reaching the sea in the vicinity of Turba, while it was found that the Turks locally laid claim to all the territory east of Sheikh Said up to the line of J. Am Missas, J. Kharaz, and Has Arab.H. Subsequently, investigations showed tliat the western borders of the Jul4di, Burerni, and Atifi sectioiis of the Subehi extended respectively to the points, ’.ll ama, Akkar, and Kudnm, and although these extreme limits have not been insisted on the y boundary actually delimited from J. Numan to Husn Murad still vindicates the Subehi claims, as against 1 urkish pretensions, to the extent of some hundreds of square miles. The Turks bad in the past unobtrusively exercised jurisdiction up to the line of J. Am Missas and J. Kharaz, the Subehi tribal subsections of Mudariba, Aghbari, Kaluli, Mahwali, and Jarthati having actually paid taxes to the Ottoman officials at Mokha. 7. The Turkish Commissioners at first insisted strongly on their claim to the Aghbari, mainly on account of the religious importance attached by their authorities to the well-known shrine of Turha Abu-el-Esrar, situated within Aghbari limits; and it was only in the course of the Ottoman Commissioner’s recent prolonged stay at Sheikh Said that the claim was relinquished. The result was to yield a natural boundary, which, from J. Js'uman, almost entirely follows the watershed between the Hed Sea and the Gulf of Aden, is easily distinguishable, and has the further merit of being the recognized border between the tribal subsections inhabiting the countrv through which it passes. 8. Despite the general barren character of the country this section of the frontier has also the advantage that it can be easily visited by large or small parties, as sufficient water for a camp of from 300 to 400 men is to be found at short stages or marches along its entire extent. At Mijza there is abundant flowing water, and similarly at Mudariba, some 8 miles to the west of Mijza. The wells at Turba Abu- el-Esrar, some 8 miles north-west of Mudariba, yield a fair amount of good water, and water is also to be had in the Upper reaches of the Wadis Batan and Farrukhia, while there is a plentiful spring at Ghail Hurim (the point marked 1575 on the ^-inch map), in Wadi Hurim. Water is also obtainable lower down the same wadi, at the point 1120, due south of J, Jariba, as also at Am Nabia and Sukaiya, which have each a fair supply of good drinking water. 9. The Memoranda forwarded with the Commission’s letters of the 4th June, 1904, and the 8th June, 1904, contain the information obtainable from native sources as to French and Turkish past dealings at Sheikh Said, and their bearing on Subehi rights to the place. The Hakmi Sheikh Thabit Am Duren was the individual with whom the French dealt, while Sheikh Mohammad Ali Eattahi was confidentially employed by both French and Turks, as appears from his evidence given in the Memoranda above referred to. Both Sheikhs, who were very advanced in years, died early in last February, two interesting links with the past history of Sheikh Said being thus removed. 10. In accordance with the instructions contained in the Secretary of State for India’s telegram of the 18th April to the Government of India, two masonry pillars in cement (3 feet at the base and 5 feet high) have been built under the supervision of Lieutenant H. J. Couchman, K.E., at the points LXXI and LXXII in the vicinity of Sheikh Said, while the Turkish Commissioner has had a cairn of rough stone, about 2 metres in height, erected at the point LXX. 11. The proces-verbal records the definition of the north-east boundary line from Lakamat-ash-Shub to the desert agreed upon with the Turkish Commissioner, as also the places and tribes definitely recognized as on the British side of such a line. By the Sultan’s Irade of February 1903 the Turkish Commissioners were instructed ‘‘to delimit in a north-easterly direction from Lakamat-ash-Shub towards the desert/ but, as shown in paragraph 4 of the Commission’s letter of the 1st October, 1903, they then considered that they had carried out their instructions to demarcate in a north easterly direction when they had delimited to point I on the W. Bana. The specific admission that Rube’aten, Na’wa, and Dabiani belong to Yafa’ now definitely carries the line some 20 miles further in the north-easterly direction. 12. As may be noticed from the wording of the proces-verbal, I have not expressly surrendered Yafa’s rights to J uban, but have merely omitted all mention of their claim to the place, although the Ottoman Commissioner’s admission that Rube’aten, Na’wa, and Dabiani belong to Yafa’ is conditional on Juban remaining part of the Kaza of Rada. I may point out that the basis of demarcation accepted by both Governments was the status of 1901, and that at that time all four places were considered as Turkish, while the Aden Residency records of 1894 mentioned Rube’aten, Na’vva, and Juban as being within Turkish limits. Thus, in obtaining the recognition by the Turks that Rube’aten, Na’wa, and Dabiani are Yafa’, we are obtaining more than the statusof 1901 warranted. According to the document inclosed in the Commission’s letter of the 26th October, 1903, Rube’aten is so indisputably Yafa’ that it could not have been left to the Turks without a loss of prestige vis-a-vis our tribesmen, but the Yafa’ connection with the other places in question is much weaker. 13. The words in the proces-verbol “as also all other Yafa’ districts lyins? to the south and east of the aforesaid north-east line ” are intended to cover flcyu, an appanage oi the Yafa’ Sultan llaidara Muhammad of Mahjaba, and also Ahl Sa'id-al- Mashrik, a small nomad tribal section related to Dabiani, should the Turks, at the moment of demarcation, desire to dispute their Yafa’ connection. 14. Lhe statement of the Ottoman Commissioner quoted in the proces-verbal that the basis of the north-east demarcation is in general the north 45° east line, or true north-east line from Lakamat-ash-Shub up to the desert, entitles u&gt;&gt; to consider, at the least, all tribes to the south and east of the true north-east line as within the British sphere. 15. The specific admission that the Aulaki with all its sub-divisions and dependencies are one of the “ nine cantons ” completes the list of the nine tribes which the Porte since 1873 was supposed to have recognized as British. The late Resident telegram of the 20th December, 1903, slates that the Aulaki Sultan claims suzerainty over Behan-al-Kasab. If this is so, in fact, the district is a dependency of the Aulaki. I believe, moreover, a Treaty was concluded early in 1904 with Sharif Ahmad Mohsin of Behan-al-Kasab. 16. The recent demarcation was proposed by the Sultan of Turkey on the basis of the “nine cantons,” i.e., the nine British tribes notified to the Porte in 1873. As Beda was not one of these, it became imperative vis-a-vis the Turkish Government, as repeatedly pointed out by the Commission, to enter into Treaty engagements with Beda as early as possible, and notify the same to the Porte so as to bring it within the scope of His Majesty’s Government’s declaration in 1873 that it reserved the right to make fresh Treaties with the tribes. The hitch in concluding a Treaty with Beda (vide Resident’s telegram to Foreign Representative, Simla, of the 12tli May, 1904) and its consequent omission from the notification to the Porte of the 11th August, 1904, made it, with its dependencies, the one serious gap in the north-eastern line. 17. Were a joint Anglo-Turkish Mission to proceed as far as the north-eastern limits of Dabiani, the Turkish Commissioners would refuse to recognize Beda as within our sphere, and a prolonged delay would occur before precise orders on the subject could be obtained and reach them from Constantinople. It is true that the words in the proces-verbal, “in general the N. 45° E. line up to the desert,” imply that Beda, &amp;c., are on the British side of the line, but a Turkish Commission on the spot would, nevertheless, probably maintain that Beda and its dependencies are part of the Turkish administrative sub-district of Rada. 18. As a protracted stay in the Dabiani country, a barren tract, where commu nications are execrable and transport difficulties very great, would be most costly, if not, indeed, dangerous, it would seem essential that, before any Joint Commission ever undertakes the north-eastern demarcation, the Turkish Government should be induced to send categorical instructions to the Yaman authorities to recognize Beda with its dependencies as belonging to the district of the “nine cantons.” 19. For that purpose, after a Treaty is concluded with Beda, the Porte could be reminded that His Majesty’s Government, in notifying the original nine tribes to the Ottoman Government in 1873, had specially reserved the right to enter into fresh engagements of the sort, and informed that such arrangements had been concluded with Beda and, perhaps also Behan-al-Kasab, which lie mainly to the south of the true north-eastern line from Lakamat-ash-Shub up to the desert, now agreed to as the basis of the north-eastern demarcation, and consequently fall within the limits of the district of the nine cantons. 20. Since they re-occupied Yemen in 1870-73, the Turks have only once pene trated in the direction of Beda, the small town of Rada being their starting point. Should the tribes report a Turkish movement into the Ghanami or Malgami outlying dependencies of Beda, we should, I think, even before the conclusion* of a Treaty with Beda, be entitled to protect, on the ground that these places are mainly south of the true north-eastern line to the desert, now recognized by the Turks as in principle the boundary line in those regions. 21. The Turkish Commissioner at Sheikh Said being personally most anxious for a speedy settlement, and at the same time unaware that we were prepared not to insist on the definite recognition of the Aulaki and dependencies as one of the nine tribes,5 telegraphed on the 22nd March, 1905 (please see my telegram No. 9 of the 24th March, 1900, to the British Ambassador, Constantinople), pointing out that “ as Nisab, the ^ulak! head-quarters lay well south of the N. 45° E. line implied in the Imperial irad6 of the 12th February, 1903 (i.e., the 30th January, 1318, Turkish date), the Aulaki and dependencies would appear to have been impliedly admitted as one of the nine cantons.’ ^ On the 2nd April he received a telegraphic reply from the Minister War, informing him, on behalf of the Grand Vizier, that “ in view of the statements :n his {i.e., the Turkish Commissioner’s) telegram of the 22nd March, there was no reason to hesitate about the status of Aulaki as one of the nine cantons.” X ^ive these details, as a reference to them may be useful, should Beda and Behan ever become the subject of discussion with the Sublime Porte. 22. With the somewhat important exception of Beda, the Turkish Commissioner has now accepted substantially the desiderata set forth in the Government of India’s telegram of the 14th July, 1904, to the Secretary of State for India. I may also point out that in the case of all four of the nine tribes whose borders have come under the delimitation {i.e., the Yafa’, Amiri, Haushabi, and Subehi), considerably more has been obtained than had been expected previous to demarcation. The accepted basis ol the latter being the tribal norders according to the status of 1901, the frontier laid down is, in places, not a natural one. This applies, perhaps, especially to the section of the Haushabi border which crosses the Addareja Valley between Basesa and Has Namis, instead of following the natural line of the crest of Jabal-am-Amma and Jabal Jarban down to Jalisa {vide paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the Commission’s No. 19 of the loth March, 1904). 23. I understand projects are under consideration for the construction of a light railway from Aden up the liban Valley to the Haushabi border, presumably some where in the vicinity of Addareja, and it was with a view to the possibility of a railway terminus in that neighbourhood that the Boundary Commission endeavoured, with success, to arrange that the principal water supplies to the south of Jabal-am- Amma should be left on the British side of the line. Should these railway projects be realized, the trade of the fertile districts near Taiz and Ibb would be tapped, and there would certainly be an increase of traffic and business in and around Mavia, with a corresponding increase of Turkish Customs “ activity ” in the valley north of Addareja. In such an eventuality the necessity for a ratification of the boundary to the crest of Jabal-am-Amma, &amp;c., would probably be more seriously felt than at present. 24. Though the status of 1901 precluded the possibility of taking the boundary along the natural line of the crests of the hills at the time of demarcation, the Arabic documents attached to the Boundary Commission’s No. 19 of the 15th Alarch, 1904, show that tribally the Haushabi Sultan might be entitled to claim the Am Amma- Jarban-Jalisa line, a rectification that would be more acceptable to the Wajihi and Shamera villagers now that the Haushabi Sultan Ali Mana has replaced the lately deceased Sultan Mohsiu, and the latter’s harsh rule has given place to the more conciliatory methods of his successor. 25. Copies of all documents and maps of the south-west Suhehi frontier have also been forwarded, as usual, for transmission to the Government of India, Foreign Department, the Government of Bombay, the Secretary of State for India, and His Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople. The maps and description of boundary sent to the Government of India will, I jn’esume, be forwarded to the Surveyor-General of India with a view to the completion of the final boundary maps required for ratification at Constantinople. 26. With reference to the large scale map of Sheikh Said, the boundary between Jabal Kuwah and Husn Murad had, according to my instructions, to be drawn so as to pass a certain distance inland from the actual shore line, while leaving the village of Turba and its wells on the Turkish side. In the original survey the coast line was slightly inaccurate, and the alteration shown on the map is by Captain Bond, B.E. 27. I have handed over the archives of the Boundary Commission to the Political Besident, Aden. They contain such a large number of documents referring to other than purely boundary matters, that I have thought it useful for future reference to subjoin a list of the principal documents having a direct hearing on the different sections of the frontier.

FITZMAURICE, British Commissioner.India Office, London, 3rd November 1905. Secret, No. 33. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, My attention has been drawn to the correspondence regarding Railway Board for August 1905. It is stated in Mr. Eraser’s letter to the Government of Bombay of the 8th July 1905, No. 2609 E.B., that the Government of India are prepared to consider favourably proposals for the construction of a railway by private enterprise from Aden into the interior. 2. The subject, as the correspondence shows, involves many questions of policy which require careful consideration, including that of the responsibility for, and the measures necessary for the protection of the line when laid. Apart from this question of policy, the conditions of any concession, should the Sultan have the power to grant it, will require careful scrutiny. In these circumstances I request that I may be furnished with a statement of your views on the whole subject before any steps are taken in connection with the offers which may be received. Projects of railway construction in the Aden Hinterland. railway construction in the Aden Hinterland, printed in the Pro ceedings (Railway Projects) of the I have the honour to be. My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant,, .VI [AS' ft 0 From— Major-Genekal H. M. Mason ; Political Resident, Aden, X'C:,. : t To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to inform you that on the 23rd instant I received a letter from Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers of that date, of which I enclose a copy, in which they informed me that they had obtained a concession from the Abdali Sultan for the construction of a railway within Abdali limits from Nobat Dakim to Dar-al-Amir, and applied to me for a concision to extend this proposed railway into British limits from Dar-al-Amir into’Aden. I enclose true copies of English translations of the actual agreements which Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers have entered into with the Abdali Sultan, with which that firm has supplied me at my request. 2. This agreement was entered into without reference to me and appar ently both parties to it were under the impression that as the agreement was for the construction of a railway within Abdali limits, it did not concern Gov ernment and that therefore it was unnecessary to inform me. 3. I would here at once mention that Mr. Menahim Messa, another local applicant for the railway concession, has also lately approached the Abdali Sultan in this matter, and that he informed me a few days ago that the Sultan had offered to enter into an agreement with him too, and that it was only upon his suggestion that the agreement should be made dependent upon the approval and sanction of Government that the Sultan had withheld his offer. Mr. Menahim Messa informed me that the Sultan repudiated the idea of such a condition and expressed the opinion that Government had no concern with such a matter as the construction of a railway within his limits. 4. Upon my informing Mr. Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw of the attitude usually adopted by Government in regard to direct dealings between Native States and capitalists in India and in regard to negotiations on the subject of railway concessions he pleaded ignorance thereof, expressed regret for what he had done, urged that he was actuated by a strong desire to benefit rather than to embarrass Government, and has expressed his willingness to cancel the agreement at once if so desired, in spite of the fact that he has actually deposited a sum of £ 2,000 with the Abdali Sultan by way of guaranteeing ful filment of the agreement. 5. In reporting the matter for the infoimation of Government, I have the honour to state that I have, for the present, refrained from addressing the Abdali Sultan in the matter and from asking him why he did not either inform or consult me before entering upon this important agreement. It is clear from the information given me by both Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers and Mr. Menahim Messa that the Sultan is of opinion that it was unnecessary to do so. 6. There is of course no question that the whole transaction now reported is opposed to Indian Political Practice and that a similar occurrence taking place in India itself would call for stringent remark. But in view of the fact that such a thing as a railway concession in the Aden hinterland is without precedent and in view of the consideration that the consent and goodwill of the Abdali Sultan and other neighbouring Chiefs may be held to be essential to the success of any railway undertaking in the hinterland, I would urge upon Government the desirability of taking a lenient view of the incident and of doing all possible to foster the spirit of enterprise and interest just now displayed by the Abdali Sultan in the matter. 7. Prom your letter to my address, No. 7469, dated the 5th ultimo, and its accompaniments, I note that it is desired to defer consideration of this matter until the future administration of Aden shall have been decided, the purport of this decision I personally informed Mr. Hormusjee some days before receipt of his letter now enclosed, but it is evident that the negotiations terminating with the agreement reported commenced some time before this and 1 [567PD]that owing to the Abdali Sultan pressing for an early settlement and also with a view to gaining a priority of claim over Mr. Menahim Messa, bis local com petitor, Mr. ^ Hormusjee Cowasjee, brought these negotiations to the present conclusion in the hope that the concession now applied for might eventually fall into his hands and no other. 8. The opportunity presented by the situation thus created is in some ways peculiarly favourable for the undertaking, and I have therefore the honour to again recommend that the earliest possible consideration may be given to the question, the immediate importance of which to the future development of Aden cannot well be overestimated. I refrain from remarking upon the terms of the agreements submitted pending a reply to this report. 9. In accordance with the principle laid down in Government Resolution No. 790, dated the 19th February 1881, a copy of this report is being forward ed by this mail direct to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart- ment.

Mexahem Mbssa, To— Gineral H. M. Mason - , Political Resident, Aden. We have the honour to apply to you for permission to consfruct a single tract portable railroad with steam power, for the purpose of carrying freight and passengers to and from Steamer Point, Maala and Sheikh Othman, and Aden Crater if practicable. We consider that such a railroad will aid much in the development of the trade of the settlement and be a means of developing Sheikh Otbman in particular. We shall be glad to submit more details when advised that the scheme will be favourably considered. E. Dated Aden, the 25th January 1905. From— Messrs. Men ahem Mess a, To— Major-General II. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, In December 1902 we had the honour to address General Maitland upon the subject of the construction of a Railway hence to D’thala, but at that time Government were not ready to approve of the subject. 6Hoping that conditions will now permit, and that you may be disposed to favourably report upon our proposal to the Government, we submit the following :— We apply for permission to build a rail road hence to D’thala via Sheikh Othman, Lakej and Haushabee, the concession to have a term of not less than 70 years. The Sultan of Lahej had been good enough to express his approval of the building of a railroad through his territory. The only physical features that can be stated in advance of a final survey are that we propose a 24' y or 80' standard narrow gauge. We do not ask any financial help from Government whatever, and the fact of having a Railway to the interior will facilitate the transport of troops and supplies and in addition will lead to the peaceful bearing of the tribes. The foregoing proposal we are of course prepared to amplify, under notifi cation from Government of their being interested therein. Copies of our previous applications and the reply thereto are herewith forwarded for easy reference. Dated Aden, the 4th December 19021. From— Messrs. Menahem Messa, To —Brigadier-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident, Aden. We have the honor to ask whether Government is prepared to grant a concession for the building of a Railway from Aden into the interior up to the boundary between British and Turkish territory, adjacent to D'thala, and if so, we beg to he informed upon what terms the concession would be granted to us. We of course are prepared to give more details upon receipt of the advice that Government will look favourably upon the granting of a concession in this matter to private interests. Dated Aden, the 4th December 190£. From—M essrs. Menaham Messa, To— Brigadier-General P. J. Maitland, C.R., Political Resident, Aden. We have the honour to request that you will be good enough to give us copies of the surveys, and plans, and any statistics and reports which the Government have had made and collected in connection with the proposed Railway from Aden into the interior connecting with the Turkish Frontier at or about D’thala, as we wish to communicate the same to our friends in London for the purpose of enabling them to make an estimate in connection with the project under consideration. We hope that the Government will see their way to giving us the benefit of the work done by them in this direction that we may the sooner put a com plete offer in your hands. No. 8, dated Aden, the 2nd January 1903. From—L ieutenant-Colonel J. S. Ashby, Political Agent and First Assistant to the Resident, To— Messrs. Menaham Messa, Aden. I am requested by General Maitland to inform you that he has received your letters re a Railway into the interior of Arabia and to inform you that there are no surveys, plans, etc., and that no proposal for the construction of a railway is before Government. 2. Your application regarding a concession will be held over until his return, but as no proposal for construction of a Railway is before Government, they would naturally not be prepared at present to consider any application for a concession. 78 3P.

Fraser, Esq., C.I.E., Officiating Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I am directed to invite a reference to the letter No. 475, dated 29th January 1905, addressed to the Bombay Government by the Political Resident, Aden (a copy of which has been forwarded direct to the Government of India by Major-General Mason), on the subject of the agreements entered into by Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw &amp; Brothers of Aden with the Abdali Sultan for the construction of a Railway within Abdali limits from Nobat Dakim to Dar-al-Amir, and the request of that firm for a concession to extend the pro posed line of railway into Aden. A copy of my telegram, dated 9th February 1905, to the Political Resident and of his letter ho. 1089, dated 26th idem, in reply thereto, is herewith enclosed, in order to place the Government of India in possession of the correspondence on the subject up to date. 2. I am to observe that, although the Bombay Government cannot recommend the above proposals in their present crude form, nor, consistently with past policy, recognise or support tlie agreements as they at present stand, His Excellency in Council considers that the scheme marks a most important stage in the progress of the question of railway development in the Aden Hinterland. Putting aside irregularities in procedure and the obvious objections inherent in the terms of the agreement, it is apparent that the Abdali Sultan, who is one of the most important of the Arab Chiefs and one with whom we have the closest relations, has entered upon an agreement with a private firm for the construction of a Railway from one end of his territories to the other ; that those territories come within a very few miles of Aden itself; that the problem of Railway construction in the Protectorate is thus narrowed down very considerably ; and that, apait from the simple question of ways and means, the present incidents mark a great stride in advance in the direction of consoli dating our political influence in the Protectorate. 3. In regard to the terms of the draft as submitted, it is unnecessary, until the Governor-General in Council has come to a decision on the question of policy, to say more than that in its present form, owing to the unfamiliarity of the parties concerned with Indian Political Practice, it is irregular and' J. could not be accepted without material alteration. No arrangements will, of course, be proceeded with pending receipt of the orders of the Government of India, and I am only to remark generally that this Government 'would regard with favour a scheme for the construction of a lino at all events as far as Nobat Dakim. ^ J ccompaniments to letter to the Secretary to the Goner ament of India, Foreign Department, No. 2571, dated 22nd April 1905.

Your letter No. 475, dated the 29th January last. Please examine matter in light of treaties of 1843, 1841 and 1849 ; also in light of Government of India orders connected with mining and prospecting concessions passed in numerous cases ending with Kirkpatrick’s, and report by letter your opinion as to terms and conditions which should be imposed on any agreement which could be recognised by Government. No. 1089, dated the 26th February 1903. From—M ajor-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—C. H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. In compliance with the request contained in your telegram dated the 9th instant, I have the honour to submit, for the consideration of Government, the following report concerning the railway agreement referred to in my letter No. 475, dated the 29th ultimo, and as to the terms and conditions which should, in my opinion, be imposed on any agreement which could be recognized by Government. 2. In regard to the attitude adopted in the matter by the Abdali Sultan in assuming that, as the proposed Kailway lies within his own limits, no reference to the British Government or to its representative in Aden is necessary, I have the honour to remark that this is not only opposed to Indian Political, Practice in regard to both direct dealings between Native States and capitalists and also to negotiations on the subject of Bailway pr Mining or any other concessions, but that it is further clearly inconsistent with the actual Treaty relations into which the Abdali Sultan has entered with the British Govern ment. 3. In Article 9 of the Treaty executed in 1849, he has declared that in all things relating to the peace, progress and prosperity ^ of Aden he wull lend his utmost aid to support the interests of the British, and that he will listen to and, if possible, attend to the advice of the British Govern ment representative at Aden in all matters. And in his treaty of 18G7 he has already, in regard to both an aqueduct and a road leading from British limits into his territory, admitted certain principles and rights of intervention and control by Government which must logically be held equally applicable to the case of a railway. 4. It does not seem open to question that such a thing as a Bailway which is projected to run from a point immediately adjacent to British limits into the Aden Hinterland is a thing which does closely concern the peace, progress and prosperity of Aden : and there does not therefore appear to be any room for hesitation in asserting that in point of fact the Abdali Sultan is bound to consult and to attend to the advice of the Political Besident at Aden in regard to such a project. yi 1 l10 5. In view of tlio consideration that his consent and 2 :ood-will is most important to the success of the enterprise, it would appear politic to take as lenient a view as possible of his present attitude. At the same time it appears absolutely necessary to correct it. r 6. In regard to the Parsi capitalist concerned, it seems sufficient to remark that it would not seem fair to allow him to gain any undue advantage oyer other competitors by his recent action ; and that in view of the fact that his Jewish rival acting under my advice expressly refrained from enterino* mto any agreement which w^as not made subject to the sanction and consent of Government, it seems only just that he too should be given an opportunity of tendering for any scheme that may eventually receive that sanction. This gentleman, Mr. Menahim Messa, is a capitalist of considerable substance and standing in South-Western Arabia. He is said to have more capital at his back than Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshavv &amp; Bros. The name of Sassoon has been mentioned amongst his other supporters. His family have been resident in this portion of Arabia for many generations, and h:s standing and position amongst the tribes of the hinterland is considerable. • i Z* re £ ar( ^ ^1° scheme as set forth in the agreement recently entered mto between the Abdali Sultan and Messrs Cow T asjee Dinshaw &amp; Bros it appears to suffer from inherent defects which place it, as it stands, beyond the possibility of acceptance. 8. In order to secure the concession, the capitalist appears willing to make sacrifices which seem prejudicial to the success of the undertaking from a business point of view, whilst from a political point of view he takes it upon lumself to guarantee the Sultan certain rights and privileges to which he is entitled by neither Treaty nor usage. 9. Special exception must be taken to the imposition of quit rent on land to be occupied by the railroad and stations, to the absence of any survey or plans or statistics of Hie actual project proposed, to the unwarrantable guarantee of rights of jurisdiction over British and Foreign subjects, to the boycot of Jews and Europeans from the enterprise, and to the lack of any proper provision for preliminary inspection, accounts, returns, weights of loads, and reports of accidents, etc. 1( ?;. Th ® m 'F e ^ of such agreement having been drafted increases the difficulties of ultimately negotiating the enterprise; and though Mr. Hormusjee Cowasjee may have been actuated by the best and most loyal of motives, there seems little doubt that his somewhat hasty conclusion of his own recent direct negotiations with (he Sultan must not only lead to his own discomfiture, but is calculated to considerably add to the difficulties of carrying any Railway scheme into the Aden Hinterland to a successful issue. 11. As to the terms and conditions which I think it necessary to impose upon any agreement which could be recognized by Government, I have the honour to suggest the following (a) The project must be submitted in full detail to Government for approval and sanction. {b) Land should he granted free of charge for all purposoe of the railroad subject to compensation being paid for any actual loss sustained and proved to the satisfaction of Government. Kvj u urisuiciion over tne line must ue suujeui to uovernment supervisio Jurisdiction over all British subjects and over all Europcr loieign subjects must he ceded to Government entirely. Juri diction over African or Asiatic Foreign subjects may be exercise by the Court of the Abdali Sultan subject to the s^pervfsion Government. r {d) Materials required for construction of line, stations, etc., shall be free of taxation.(e) Similar personal privileges shall be extended to the Eesidentat Aden as to the Abdali Sultan. (f) No portion of the line shall be opened to traffic of goods or passengers until it has been inspected and pronounced fit for such traffic by an officer appointed by Government. (g) The general principles of the Indian Railway Act shall be followed in regard to inspections, accounts, returns, weight of loads, and reports of accidents. {h) Proper arrangements for the protection of the line and of traffic and passengers shall be made and approved by Government. (i) The Government Postal Department shall be allowed to use the line on the terms in force in State Railways in India. (;') No telegraph line or telephone shall be erected except with the sanc tion and subject to the control of Government. (&amp;) All proprietors or shareholders in the Railway shall be persons subject to or protected by the British Government. (l) The Abdali Sultan shall have a prior right to own shares in so much of the railway as lies within his own limits and shall be allowed to borrow capital for the purchase of such shares upon terms approved of by Government. (m) The Abdali Sultan shall at any time after the expiry of 70 years have a right to purchase so much of the line as lies within his limits. Government shall have the same right to purchase so much as lies within their limits. (n) None of the above conditions shall affect the Abdali Sultan’s present claim to transit dues which shall be collected at a special Customs House established for the purpose and managed by the Abdali Sultan’s own officials in accordance with the advice of Govern ment. Government, however, is at liberty to make some arrange ment with the Abdali Sultan to purchase or compound this claim hereafter. 12. I think that most of the above terms and conditions will be consi dered necessary by Government and that most of them call for no special remark. Upon clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), ( f ), (i), (j), and (&amp;), I think that insistence will be considered necessary. 13. As to clause (c), the question of jurisdiction must of course be expect ed to present difficulties which it may not be easy to at once overcome. It would appear necessary to insist upon entire cession of jurisdiction over British and European Eoreign subjects, and to secure as far as possible Government supervision over all others. 14. Clause (e) I think politic and is in accordance with local usage and tradition. 15. As to clauses (J) and («), I think that some concessions of the kind are advisable with a view to gaming the sympathy and interest of the Abdali Sultan in the undertaking, 16. As to clause (»),itis of course much to be desired in order to facilitate trade that the matter of transit dues should, if possible, be settled by com promise and that this troublesome imposition should thereafter cease. 17. The opportunity presented by negotiations to secure the abvove terms and conditions might perhaps be utilized with advantage to endeavour to arrive at a more satisfactory understanding on the subject of extradition of criminals. 18. Meanwhile I have the honour to recommend that the earliest possible consideration may be paid to the proposal to construct a Railway from Aden to Sheikh Othman, and that I may be informed as soon as Government are inclined 11to view with favour any practicable scheme which may be put forward for the construction of that portion of Railway. The actual construction of such aline territory, and itself would tend largely to the material benefit of the settlement of Aden. No. 2609-E.B., dated Simla, the/th July 1905. From—S. M. Friser, Esq., C.I.E., Officiating Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, To—The Hon'ble Mr. S. W. Edgerlet, C.I.E,, Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay. 1 am directed to acknowledge the receipt of the marginally* noted corre- * Letter No. 475, dated the 29th January 1905, spondence, on the subject of agreements al-Amir, and the request of that firm for a concession to extend the proposed line into Aden. 2. In reply, I am to state that the Government of India are now prepared to consider favourably proposals for the construction of a Railway by private enterprise from Aden into the interior, but before accepting the present offer from Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Bros., they would suggest, for the con sideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council, that an opportunity of submitting definite proposals should be offered to other applicants of good financial position who, in the past, have expressed their desire to open up Railway communications with the Aden Hinterland. 3. It is observed that the Resident in his letter of the 26th Eedruary 1905 takes exception to certain points in the terms of the agreement with the Abdali Sultan for the construction of a line in his territory, and suggests the insertion of certain provisions to be framed on the lines customary in the case of an agreement for the construction of a railway in India, and under Indian conditions. The circumstances at Aden, however, are so different from those in India that to insist on the application of Indian regulations, would probably result in the indefinite postponement of the construction of any railway in the Aden Protectorate. 4. The only stipulations which, in the opinion of the Government of India should be insisted on, are :— (a) The retention of jurisdiction by Government over Europeans and British subjects. (b) The right of the Government to use the Railway for military pur poses, under conditions as regards rates and fares. (c) The right of Government to purchase the line in British territory, at not less than cost price, if it be desired to do so at any time. 5. It is further advisable that the plans and estimates for the portion within Government territory, should be inspected by the Government of India before construction begins, and that that portion should be subject, as regards the transport of passengers, to such regulations as may bo considered necessary. 6. On the question of gauge and standard there seems no necessity to express an opinion at present, but should the services of an experienced Rail way Engineer be desired by the firm which undertakes the project, the Govern ment of India would be prepared to depute an officer for the purpose. would probably tend to facilitate negotiations for its extension into Abdali from the Hesident at Aden. from the Rciident at Aden.

I need scarcely say that the line, if constructed, would be of very great advantage to Aden, and would restore its trade, which is now suffering from the development of the French line to Abyssinia. Moreover, it would nowhere pass through, or touch, any hostile, or even slightly hostile country.

Sir, I have the honour to apply for the concession of the sole right to build a railway from Aden, through La Hej and Nobat, to Lhalla, or any portion of such a railway that may be con- sidered advisable* As, before any construction work could be undertaken, the district under discussion would have to be thoroughly explored and surveyed by capable engineers, and full details as to cost of construction, and available trade, gone into, T would suggest that a provisional concession should be gran ted, to run for two years. This would allow time for all preliminary work to be thoroughly gone into. The concession should also provide that, if the conces sionaire, at the end of two years, is willing to builn the railway, then he shall be granted a pemament concession with such attached conditions as the authorities may think necessary T presume that I should have to make my own arrangements with the interested natives, principally the Sultan of La Hej, but as X understand he is anxious for such a railway T anti cipate no difficulty in that quarter.I also have the honour to apply for a similar conces sion to build an electric tramway, to connect Steamer Point with the Grater, and at the same time supply both towns and Maala with electric light, T may mention that if these concessions are granted, it would be a great help if these preliminary negotiations were completed in time for the cold weather to be utilised in exploratory work, I have the honour, to be.

The Political Resident, Aden, Arabia* Sir, I have received youF letter of August 12th, and note that you have no objections to my entering into contracts with the Arabs on the southern coast of Arabia for the purchase of guano. Also that you previously informed me of the same, unfortunately the letter missed me, as I left Aden on the morning of July 1st. I also note that my application for a concession to p^oi- pect for guano has been referred to Bombay. Although nothing has been said about my applications for railway concessions in Aden and adjoining territory, I presume that they also have been referred to Bombay. With reference to these railway applications, it may facilitate matters, and save correspondence, to mention as a reference Messrs. Reynolds, Carter and Reynolds, of 18 St. Swithin’s Lane, London, E.C. Tn the event of the concessions being granted, and preliminary investigations being satisfac- tory, full and acceptable bank refernces will be supplied as to financial ability to carry out the undertaking.1 # In conclusion, may I a^ain call your attention to the fact that, if the applications are favourably considered, an early reply would admit of preliminary operations being un dertaken in the coming cold weather, I have the honour to be.
