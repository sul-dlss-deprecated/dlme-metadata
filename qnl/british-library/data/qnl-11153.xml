A HANDBOOK OF MESOPOTAMIA Volume III CENTEAL MESOPOTAMIA WITH SOUTHERN KTJEDISTAN AND THE SYRIAN DESERT Prepared on behalf of the War ADMIRALTY WAR STAFF INTELLIGENCE DIVISION (C.B. 295.) J anuary , 1917NOTE Mesopotamia is treated in four volumes. The first volume contains matter of a general nature. The other volumes are devoted to the detailed description of the river and land routes. The second volume covers the regions of the Shatt el- e Arab and Karun, and of the Tigris and Euphrates up to Baghdad and Fellujeh. To the third volume are assigned the Tigris and Euphrates from Baghdad and Fellujeh to Mosul and Meskeneh, the Lesser Zab ? the country East of the Tigris towards the Persian frontier, and the routes running westward from the Euphrates valley across the Syrian Desert. The fourth volume treats of the country North of the line joining Rowanduz, Mosul, Meskeneh, and Aleppo up to Van, Bitlis, Diarbekr, and Marash. All estimates of mileage must be considered as approximate only. In most cases they are based on the rough calculations of travellers, or on the times given by travellers, or on sketch-maps or incomplete surveys. The question-marks placed beside some of the figures indicate that these are peculiarly doubtful: it is not implied that other figures may be regarded as exact. It is necessary to emphasize the fact that in the circumstances the information given cannot be complete, and that conditions are con stantly undergoing change. The Admiralty will be glad to receive corrections and additions. Maps to accompany these volumes will be issued separately.ABBEEVIATIONS In the itineraries the following abbreviations and conventional signs may be noted :— r. = right. 1. = left. h.w. = high water, l.w. = low water.

General Remarks. [a] The Plains. —The conditions of movement and transport in the country N. of Baghdad are on the whole very- different from those prevailing in Lower Mesopotamia. The Tigris and the Euphrates are still important as affording main lines of advance, but as waterways they are far less useful, at least for up-stream navigation, than in Irak, owing to the more rapid current, shallower depths, and numerous rocks and small rapids which characterize their middle courses. On the other hand, the surface of the plains which extend from Syria on the W. to the hills of Kurdistan on the E. is much better suited to movement by land than that of the alluvial desert and marsh of Irak and Arabistan. There had indeed been hardly any road-making in these plains before the present war: a short stretch of the Baghdad—Aleppo caravan-route north of Deir ez-Zor seems to have been the only metalled carriage-road. But, in dry weather at least, tracks that need little or no improvement to make them passable for wheels can generally be found. In wet weather the region where the tracks suffer most is the alluvial plain N. and NE. of Baghdad. The clay that predominates in the plains E. of the Tigris and N. of Samarra also makes bad going after rain. The Southern Jezlreh between the Euphrates and the Tigris, and the Sy rian Desert W. of the Euphrates, consist for the most part of hard ground which is comparatively little affected by rain : though even here soft going may be found in patches of deep sand, or along streams like the Belikh and Khabur and the brooks that water the plain under the Sinjar Hills. In the valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris are strips of alluvium. The chief obstacles in the plains are, first, the two great rivers and their large tributaries (Diyaleh, 'Adheim, the two Zabs, Khabur, and Belikh), and, secondly, the numerous wadis. These latter appear10 INTRODUCTION to be generally passable for wheels or easily made so by a little ramping, &amp;c. In winter and spring, however, some of them at times contain considerable torrents. Irrigation-cuts are not common except in the cultivated areas of the alluvial plain N. and NE. of Baghdad, where a good deal of bridging and ramping might be necessary here and there. South of the Sinjar the only important line of hills is the low but rugged Jebel Hamrln. Broken hilly ground is also found along the edges of the desert-plateau over looking the Tigris and Euphrates. The principal and very serious difficulty attending movement in the plains is the prevailing lack of water and supplies. The effect of this on the direction of main routes, &amp;c., will be discussed below. (&amp;) The Kurdish Hills. —The hill-country of Kurdistan S. of Kowanduz may be divided roughly into two zones which gradually merge into each other: the zone of the foot-hills and down-country, and the zone of the higher ranges. In the first, movement is generally fairly easy. Open rolling downs, low ridges, and wide valleys of clay, gravel, sandstone, &amp;c., form its principal features. Most of the tracks as far as Salahiyeh, Suleimaniyeh, Eaniyeh, and Eowanduz, where not already passable for wheels, could be improved fairly easily. The chief obstacles are the Greater and Lesser Zab (both fordable here and there in the low- water season), and their principal affluents, which are for the most part easily fordable except when in spate from rain or melted snow. A certain amount of work may be needed to make the banks of some of the stream-beds and wadis passable for wheels. Water in this region is generally plentiful, there is good grazing in spring, and the country, though much under-cultivated, is sufficiently tilled and populated to support a number of small towns. Eastwards the ranges become gradually higher and more rugged ; the tracks through the hills more stony, steep, and narrow. The mountains enclose small fertile plains, but these are often damp and muddy. The higher passes are blocked with snow in winter. Stretches of road passable for wheeled transport become more and more rare, until by the time the Persian frontier is reached only mule-tracks ranging in quality from fair to bad may be found. Supplies are scanty, but water and fuel are plentiful, and there is a good deal of grazing. The Main Routes from Baghdad —The desert character of most of the plain country has the effect of limiting to three the main lines of movement between Baghdad and Upper Mesopotamia: (a) the line of the Euphrates, towards Aleppo, &amp;c.;INTKODUCTION 11 (&amp;) the line of the Tigris to Mosul ; and (c) through the foot-hills of the Kurdish ranges via Salahiyeh (Kufri), Kirkuk, and Altun Koprii to Mosul. (a) The Line of the Euphrates. —The Baghdad—Aleppo caravan- route runs from Baghdad westward to the Euphrates at Fellujeh, with a Decauville railway to Eidhwaniyeh to S. of it. It then follows the r. (western) side of the river to Meskeneh, where it turns W. to Aleppo. This road is passable for vehicles in all weathers, though before the war it was unmetalled except for a few miles N. of Deir ez-Zor, and was therefore liable after rain to become soft and heavy for wheeled vehicles. A good many wadis, some of which are rather difficult, have to be crossed. There was a fair amount of wheeled traffic passing over it at all seasons, and the journey between Baghdad and Aleppo had been occasionally made by motors before 1914. Water is plentiful, chiefly from, the river. Supplies are limited, though there is some cultivation along the valley. There is good grazing in the neighbourhood of the river during spring. Fuel is very scarce in some parts ; in others it is supplied by tamarisk, &amp;c. Whether transport could be obtained would depend on the atti tude of the neighbouring nomads and semi-nomads. (See further, llonte 46.) On the 1. bank there is no regular route, but from the reports of the few travellers who have ridden over parts of this side of the Euphrates the country appears to be generally open and easy, with the usual wadis, patches of soft sand and alluvium, &amp;c. The Belikh and Khabur tributaries are the chief obstacles on the E. side of the river. (See Boute 47.) As a water-way, the middle Euphrates has been much used for down-stream traffic. Above Hit it cannot be ascended by sailing- craft owing to the rapidity of the current. It has been occasionally navigated up-stream by steamers and motor-boats; but even for these it would be very difficult if not impossible to ascend the river when it was at its highest or lowest. Blasting, &amp;c., might improve some of the places where rocks have formed rapids. (See further, Routes IV F, G, H.) (&amp;) The Line of the Tigris. —The section of the Baghdad Railway between Baghdad and Mosul will follow the r. (western) side of the Tigris Valley. At present only the part of the line between Baghdad and Samarra appears to have been completed. From Samarra to Tekrit and from Tekrit to Mosul the land route on the r. bank goes through very sparsely inhabited country where12 INTRODUCTION supplies are almost wholly lacking. Moreover, where the Tigris breaks through the Jebel Hamrln, the route has to turn aside from the river and runs some 38 m. through desert very scantily supplied with water. There is grazing on the route in spring, but fuel is very scarce. The Jebel Hamrln, which is crossed SE. of Qal'ah Sherghat, is broken and rugged, and there are stretches of broken ground else where, e.g. near Tekrit. Nevertheless, before the war the route had been traversed by light wheeled vehicles occasionally, and once even by a motor. On the 1. bank there was no regular route over the whole distance from Baghdad to Mosul, though caravans travelled sometimes on that side of the river between Baghdad and Samarra, between Samarra and Dur, and between the Great Zab near its mouth and Mosul. The chief disadvantage of the 1. bank as a line for a through route from Baghdad to Mosul appears to be the necessity of crossing near their mouths the three large tributaries of the Tigris, the 'Adheim, and the two Zabs. The Tigris was bridged before the war at Baghdad, Samarra, and Mosul. There was much down-stream raft-traffic on the Middle Tigris before the war, but sailing vessels did not as a rule go up-stream to Samarra. The possibilities of steamer navigation between Samarra and Mosul are very uncertain. The conditions appear to be more unfavourable than those on the Euphrates above Hit. (See III E.) (c) The Salahiyeh— KirJouJc Line. —The disadvantages of the Tigris line mentioned above, and also the former insecurity of the Tigris Valley, have brought into existence a caravan-route from Baghdad' to Mosul along the foot-hills of the Kurdish mountains, where there are a few towns (Salahiyeh, Kirkuk, Altun Koprti, Erbil, besides a number of large villages) and a certain amount of cultivation, so that sufficient supplies are generally obtainable in normal times for fair-sized parties of troops or travellers. Before the present war this road apparently needed only slight improvements here and there, and some bridging (particularly at the Great Zab) to make it passable throughout for guns and carts. In spring, troops might be held up bv floods on a number of streams which at other times would be easily fordable. Water is apparently abundant in spring and sufficient at other seasons. There is good grazing on the route in spring. (See Boute 25a.) Lateral Communications between the main routes from Baghdad into Upper Mesopotamia may be summarized as follows :— (a) Communications across Lower JesireJ —These include the routesINTEODU CTION 13 between the Middle Euphrates and the Tigris valleys. In general it may be said that the difficulties of communication across the Jezireh are due not to the ground but to lack of water and supplies. North of ery the Baghdad—Fellujeh line which is traversed by the Baghdad— l at ' Aleppo caravan-route the southern part of the Lower Jezireh is a very lse ' arid desert, hardly passable except by camel-caravans, small parties of horsemen, or motor-cars. The going seems to be firm and easy except at occasional wadis. Very little is known of the tracks tlie across this region used by the Arabs. For a desert route from Anah led to Baghdad, see Route 48. It is possible that the line of the Wadi r !' a ' Tartar would be found useful in traversing the Lower Jezireh from . its SW. to NE. or vice versa (e. g. between Hit and Qal'ah Sherghat or i ne Mosul). There seems to be water (brackish?) even in the lower tlie (southern) part of the Wadi Tartar for at least most of the year. ! of Nearer the Sinjar Hills conditions improve, and a number of fairly 5^ well frequented routes over open easy country connect Mosul w T ith Deir ez-Zor. The chief obstacle is the River Khabur, which seems, : ris however, to be fordable here and there in the low-water season. Water is less scarce than in the southern part of Lower Jezireh. It rra jg always to be found in abundance in the Khabur River, and ore a number of small streams run down from the Sinjar Hills into the ''fe plain, but these may dry up in summer. There are also a fair number of springs in the desert. The water in some of the streams and springs is rather brackish or sulphurous, though usually drinkable. I' s Good grazing may be found in this region in spring. Fuel is obtain- ^ able in the Sinjar Hills. The lines preferred by guides in crossing lad this country vary with the season, the condition of wells, &amp;c. The ere route from Mosul to Deir via 'Ain el-Ghazal and Tel es-Sawwar is J'- certainly passable for wheels, but it is reported that infantry would 80 not be able to use the route in summer owing to scarcity of water, for (See Route 49 a.) The more northerly route (49 b) lies under the Sinjar W® Hills, passing through Beled Sinjar and Sekenik. This appears to sW) be passable for vehicles, though the track may become heavy after rain and would perhaps need improvement at wadis. The direct up routes between Sekenik and the Khabur at Shedadi or Tel Arabian be (see Routes 49 c, d) appear to suffer from lack of water. A circuitous ent way from Sekenik to the Khabur which crosses between the Jebel See Sinjar and the Jebel Jereibeh by the Shillo Pass and then turns W. along the northern side of the hills, may be better provided with water, but the quality of the supply seems to be poor. The Shillo fed Pass is the main passage across the hills, and, though stony, seems to need little improvement for wheels. There are other tracks over the tes Sinjar range, but they are said to be difficult. The Sinjar Mountains14 INTEODUCTION are fairly well populated : the inhabitants (Yezidis) are said to have been raiding the Deir—Mosul route since the outbreak of the war. The direct lines across the desert from Tel es-Sawwar or Shedadi on the Khabtir to Deir ez-Zor seem to be poorly supplied with water, and it might therefore be preferable to make a detour to the S., descending the Khabur to its junction with the Euphrates, and thence ascending the Euphrates Valley. (6) Communication between the Tigris — — MosulRoute. —North of the partially cultivated area that liesbetween the Tigris and the Lower Diyaleh, there stretches between the Tigris and the hills an open plain of clay and gravel traversed successively by the 'Adheim, the Hamrln Hills, the Lesser Zab, and the Great Zab. As far as the Lesser Zab this plain is apparently inhabited only by a very sparse nomadic population, who may practise a little desultory cultivation here and there on the banks of the rivers or where there are rain-water wells and springs. There is grazing in this region in spring, but in summer both water and grass are probably very scarce. The road between Salahiyeh (Kufri) and Kirkuk might perhaps be reached by following the Adheim towards the point where it emerges from the hills and then striking NW. or W. across the Jebel Hamrln : but there is no evidence as to this as a possible route. For a slight account of a route from Tekrit to Kirkuk, see Boute 26. Probably the easiest line would be along the course of the Lesser Zab from the neighbourhood of Qal'ah Sherghat to Altun Koprtl. Here water could always be obtained from the river and the country on both banks appears to be open and easy. There is a down-stream raft traffic on the Lower Zab, but whether steamers could ascend the river to Altun Koprtl even in fairly high water seems very doubtful. (See Moute III F.) North of the Lesser Zab the population, though at first semi- nomadic, seems to become more numerous. Thus in 1903 Sykes saw numerous villages on the plain between Qalah Sherghat and Makhmur, though these were then (temporarily ?) deserted owing to drought and locusts. For the route from Qal'ah Sherghat to Altun Koprtl via Makhmur, see Bout 27. The plain S. and SW. of Erbil appears to be fairly well cultivated (grain is exported thence to Baghdad) and between the Great Zab and Mosul there are numerous villages, Moslem, Christian, and Yezidi. Here over the open country are numerous tracks, and communica tion between the Tigris and the Erbil—Mosul road should be easy.INTEODUCTION 15 ave Routes towards Persian Frontier —North-east of Baghdad, in the ' ai ' neighbourhood of Khanikin and Qasr-i-Shlrln, lies the main depression on in the mountain system which divides the plateau of Iran (Persia) ■ e r, from the Mesopotamian plains. Through this depression runs the S., Baghdad—Kirmanshah caravan-route by Baqubeh, 1 Qizil Eibat, Kha- lD d nikin, and Qasr-i-Shlrln. This before the war was the only route passable for wheeled transport between Mesopotamia and Persia, and even this was not easy for vehicles beyond the Persian frontier. * In the plain between Baghdad and Khanikin the going was good Jen except after rain. (See Route 28 a.) A much more difficult alter- ; ris native route (28 b) to Kirmanshah runs by Beledruz and Mandali to ely join the main road at Khorasabad. This is liable to become very bad in the plains in wet weather, and is merely a mule-track in the hills. For connexions between these routes, see 29 and ily 28 b, m. 122i, 147|, 156|. ^ ^ Khanikin and Qasr-i-Shlrln on the main Baghdad—Kirmanshah road or are connected by easy though unmade tracks with Salahiyeh (Kufri) in on the Baghdad—Mosul road. The only serious obstacle on this set re of tracks is the Diyaleh Eiver. (See 32 a, b; 33.) id There is a made road passable for wheels from Qasr-i-Shlrln to ds the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's wells at Chiah Surkh: and there V, is a fairly easy line over the Zohab Plain between Qasr-i-Shlrln and lis the Suleimaniyeh—Kirmanshah route mentioned below, to To the N. of Qasr-i-Shlrln the first principal route-centre of Kurdistan is Suleimaniyeh, a considerable town lying in a fertile ;er though under-cultivated plain some 60-70 m. E. of Kirkuk. The ire easiest approach to Suleimaniyeh from the W. is from Kirkuk over on stony rolling hills through Chemchemal and the Baziyan Pass, jn Between Kirkuk and Chemchemal and between the Baziyan Pass and he Suleimaniyeh there appears to be a number of possible tracks; and ill. there seems to have been before the war at least one route from Kirkuk to Suleimaniyeh which was just passable for wheels ii- throughout though in need of improvement. (See 37.) Prom eg the SW. Suleimaniyeh can be approached from Salahiyeh (Kufri) by nd mule-tracks which are bad in parts. From the NW. mule-tracks ng over a more mountainous country under the Plr 'Omar Oudrun Dagh to lead to Suleimaniyeh from Koi Sanjaq and Kaniyeh : these cross the Lesser Zab by ferries at Dukhan or Khanabi. (See 39, 38.) 3d South-east from Suleimaniyeh a route leads by Halebjeh across id the Persian frontier to Kirmanshah : this is fairly easy for pack- • i^' S ^ ar as (where it crosses the Diyaleh by a bridge) it is identical with the better road from Baghdad to Delli 'Abbas on the Baghdad—Kirkuk— Mosul route. See Route 25 a.16 INTRODUCTION animals until the mountains overlooking the Ab-i-Shirwan (Upper Diyaleh) are reached. Difficult paths lead through these hills : but beyond them comparatively easy mule-roads run to Kirmanshah. (See Boute 35.) Lastly, eastwards from Suleimaniyeh, a route which in parts is practicable for led animals only leads by Penjevin over the frontier to Senna. (See Boute 36 a.) _ It has been stated that the best line for a military road or railway 1 from the Tigris Valley into the Urmia district and NW. Persia would run by the Lesser Zab Valley from Altun Koprii to Koi Sanjaq, thence to Raniyeh, and on by Pishder Plain to the Wazneh Pass, from there to El-Watan and the Lahjan Plain, and so to Ushnu and Urmia. In the present volume this line is described as far as Eaniyeh. Before the war the road from Altun Koprii to Koi Sanjaq and Eaniyeh does not seem to have been passable for wheels throughout, but it appears to have been capable of being easily improved into a carriage-road. It traverses down-country and fairly low ridges, running over clay and gravel. (See Boute 40.) Beyond Kaniyeh the route to Urmia is described in vol. iv : it may be men tioned here that at any rate in 1905 the road was not practicable throughout for all arms, and it was reported that much labour and expense would be needed to make it passable for large forces : the passes beyond Eaniyeh are blocked by snow in winter. From Koi Sanjaq and Eaniyeh roads for pack-animals lead, as has been said, to Suleimaniyeh, and mule-tracks which are difficult in parts and are mostly blocked by snow in winter connect these places with Eowanduz to the N. (See Boutes 44 a-c.) From Eaniyeh a route runs by Ser Desht to Banah. (See Boute 41.) A difficult mule- track connects Ser Desht with Penjeviri on the Suleimaniyeh Senna road. (See Boute 36 c.) The last road-centre in the area here in question is Eowanduz. This place lies, shut in among high steep hills, on the Eowanduz Chai, which here flows in a narrow, deep valley. The approaches to it before the present war were difficult even for pack-animals, but from Harlr (below) a cart-road has been made. In the present volume are described routes to Eowanduz from Mosul. One goes by c Aqreh and across the Great Zab by the Qandll ferry, the other crosses the Zab by the Girdamamik ferry farther south, and then turns NE to join the northern route near Harlr, not far from Qandll. Thence hilly country is crossed to the Khallfan gorge, by which the difficult valley of the Eowanduz Chai is reached. The southern route, if not already passable for wheels as far as Girdamamik, could probably be made so with a few improvements. (See Boutes 45 a, b.) From Erbil one route runs to join the Mosul—Eowanduz route inINTEODUOTION 17 the neighbourhood of Harir, another leads over the hills to Sha- khlawa and thence to the Khalifan gorge, where it too connects with the Mosul—Eowanduz route. These roads from Erbil are impassable for wheels except perhaps in the Erbil Plain. For the routes leading from Eowanduz NW. to Amadiyeh, north to Neri, and NE. towards El-Watan and Urmia, see vol. iv. The Syrian Desert. West of the Euphrates stretches the northern part of the Hamad, a bare stony desert which slopes gradually from Syria and Arabia NE. to the Euphrates Valley. The ground is almost flat, broken only here and there by wadis, easy undulations, or low ranges of hills. The surface is generally sand or shingle with occasional outcrops of volcanic rock. In the north, however, beyond the line Eaqqah—Hama, the nature of the soil changes and becomes more capable of cultivation, and the country between Meskeneh and Aleppo is already fairly well populated and tilled. In the desert the pools or wells, which occur at long intervals, contain water that is frequently bad and infested with leeches, &amp;c.' and generally brackish. Conditions for travel are best during a few weeks in spring. At that season there is much pasture in the hollows of the Hamad, and water-holes (known to the Bedouin) are available then which are dry later in the year. Most of the grass is shrivelled up by the middle of April. The direction of routes across the desert is generally determined by the position of water. The tracks are often badly defined or quite indistinguishable, as, owing to the easy nature of the ground, there is usually no need to follow a definite path. Towards Tadmor and Damascus the country becomes hillier, and directions are here determined to some extent by the trend of the valleys, but the chief factor is still the water-supply. Owing to the scarcity of water, Syria cannot be approached from the Euphrates Valley south of the line Meskeneh—Aleppo except by small parties or by the aid of camel-transport on a large scale. Of the routes described in this volume those which run almost due W. from Hit to Damascus {Route 52) and from Abu Kemal to Tadmor {-Route 53) are difficult even for small parties. Nothing is known of the route by the Wadi-Hauran from Jibbeh; but in 1907 it was said that Damascus could be reached in six days from the Euphrates by this route. ^ Route 52 is important only as a route for the camel- post. The main desert-route is that from Deir ez-Zor to Damascus which is part of a regular caravan-route between Damascus and Baghdad. (See Boute 54.) On the route from Eaqqah to Hama it might be possible to MES. Ill jy18 INTKODU CTION improve the water-supply. It has been stated that there is probably an underground stream flowing N. from Kusafeh to the Euphrates, and that water might be obtained from it by boring. This water, if found, would probably be brackish. Beyond Serlyeh the country seems to have been formerly well populated; water might be obtained by clearing old wells or sinking new ones. Notes on old routes between Basra and Damascus or Aleppo, which are very little used at the present day, will be found in vol. ii.RIVER ROUTES THE TIGRIS AND LESSER ZAB ROUTE HID BAGHDAD—SAMAEEA |89i M,| Authorities'.—Military Beport on E.T.A,, vol. iii, 1904 (report of 1892) ; Lorimer, Report on a Tour in Turkish Arabia and Kurdistan, April-May 1910 ; and other sources of information. Between Baghdad and Samarra (* 89^ m., t74m.) the course of the Tigris leads first in a general N. direction (as far as Ahmad el-Fayyadh m. 56) and thence generally WNW. The River. —In this section of its course the width of the river varies very considerably. Where it flows in one channel its breadth seems to be about 300-500 yds. It is broadest from bank to bank where it breaks up into several channels passing between the numerous islands which occur in successive groups above the tract of Ba'rureh on the 1. bank (see m. 68| and foil.). The rate of the current past these islands is said to be about 4^-3f m.p.h. From Baghdad to the islands the bed of the Tigris is mud ; at the islands it is shingle with outcrops of conglomerate at El-Qanatlr (m. 77^); between the neighbourhood of El-Hawiyeh on the 1. bank (m. 78) and Samarra the bed is generally of shingle, sand, or clay, with occasional outcrops of conglomerate forming small rapids in the current. While islands are especially numerous between Ba'rureh and El-Hawiyeh, they occur also between El-Hawiyeh and Samarra at various points near the r. bank. They undergo frequent alteration by the floods in the annual h.w. season. At Baheirdeh I. and Ba'rureh (m. 69), Darawish I. (m. 74^), and at Tineh (m. 85^), fords passable in the l.w. season were reported in 1910, but their situation is probably liable to be changed by the annual floods. Navigation. —The navigation of the river seems to present no special difficulties between Baghdad and Ba'rureh (m. 69) for boats of draught not exceeding 4 ft. From Ba'rureh to the neighbourhood of b 220 KIVER ROUTES El-Hawiyeh it is troublesome owing to the islands above mentioned. The rapids, already referred to, between El-Qanatlr and Samarra are apparently not considerable enough to hinder vessels of small draught even in the l.w. season. A small steam-launch, owned by a Baghdad merchant named Astrabadi, has been plying on the river between Baghdad and Samarra since 1902 with fair regularity throughout the year. l-J days were allowed for the up-stream, and 1 day for the down-stream voyage. Sailing boats carrying 8 tons, can ascend to Samarra during the greater part of the year, but it is reported that at the height of the flood season they would find it difficult or impossible to make head against the current in the channel past the islands (between m. 67 and m. 80). Traffic on the river is principally down-stream, being mainly carried on by the rafts (keleJcs, see vol. i, p. 166) which come from Tekrit and Mosul. The strong winds from the S. and SW. which are fairly frequent in the Baghdad region, especially in spring, may make the raft journey between the mouth of the Adheim River and Baghdad very slow (4 days or perhaps more): in the highest spring floods without an adverse wind the journey may take only 13-14 hrs. In fair weather the rafts travel all night. (large coracles, see vol. i, p. 166) are used locally for short journeys. For regular ferries see under m. 43f and m. 78|. The country between Baghdad and — —From Baghdad to the neighbourhood of Beled and the islands of Darawlsh (m. 74^) and Barqeh (m. 76) the Tigris flows through the most northerly part of its alluvial plain. Here the banks are of firm alluvial soil, are generally fairly high, and at places (e. g. m. 32) are protected by dykes. Nevertheless in the neighbourhood of Baghdad the flood water in spring inundates the country on either side, finding its way chiefly by the numerous irrigation-cuts. On the r. bank date-groves are almost continuous to Ferhad (m. 11), above which they occur only at three or four places on the river (a few miles inland they are to be found at Sumeikeh and Beled). N. of Beled there are no more date-groves, only isolated palm-trees. Date-groves are frequent on the 1. bank as far as the neighbourhood of Nahr el- Pasha (m. 17) and thence they occur at intervals up to Sindiyeh (m. 45|). On both sides of the river up to the neighbourhood of Darawlsh I. there are numerous water-lifts [cherrads] which irrigate areas of wheat and green barley (the latter crop being used for fodder). Between Baghdad and Beled the country W. of the immediate neighbourhood of the r. bank is a plain of alluvial soil stretching to the edge of the desert plateau. From the river to the plateau theTHE TIGEIS—ROUTE HID 21 distance varies from about 15 to about 20 m., with one noticeable ridge near the river between Husai tract (m. 49) and Qubbat Shawali (m. 60). This plain contains at its S. end the large lake-area known as 'Aqarquf, extending from a point about 5 m. W. of Kazimain in a NNW. direction for about 11 m. with an average width of about m. The plain is much cut up by canals, generally dry, or, as in the case of the upper reaches of the Dujeil, carrying some water in the flood season. These canals are specially numerous N. of the Tarmlyeh (m. 38i-): here are the numerous branches of the Dujeil, and an old bed of the Tigris running in a general NW. and SE. direction. The ground is covered with large and small ruin-mounds marking the site of ancient settlements. Cultivation occurs in patches where canals still carry water for part of the year. In wet weather the going is very heavy, but in the dry season the plain is said to be passable almost everywhere for wheeled traffic, though the canal-beds would at times compel vehicles to make detours. Across the plain runs the route from Baghdad to Samarra and Mosul, traversed by the Samarra—Baghdad pilgrim wagons, and accom panied by the line of the Baghdad—Samarra railway. For further details with regard to the country see notes on the above-mentioned route (25 b). From the 1. bank of the river, as far as the neighbourhood of Sindiyeh (above which the up-stream course begins to take a general NW. direction towards the 'Adheim), a flat alluvial plain stretches towards the Diyaleh river (distant 11-16 m.). In the neighbourhood of Baghdad the plain is liable to inundation during the spring floods. For the swamps of Eeshldiyeh and Jedeideh see under m. 19f. This country between the Tigris and the Diyaleh is still more intersected by canals than the plain on the opposite bank, and a far greater proportion of the cuts on this side carry water, for most of them belong to the system of the Nahr Khalis, which brings the water of the Diyaleh from the neighbourhood of Mansuriyeh (see m. 38^). The Khalis, near Deltaweh, divides into two principal branches, a westerly, the Muradlyeh, and an easterly, the Tahwlleh, which flow in a general southerly direction to the neighbourhood of Baghdad. But the Khalis and its two great arms also throw off a multitude of smaller irrigation-cuts which are interlaced by cross- cuttings. The whole system waters large areas of wheat and barley and supports a large number of villages between the Tigris and the Diyaleh. Across the plain run the Baghdad—Salahiyeh—Mosul route, throwing off a branch to Samarra near Deltaweh, and the Baghdad Baqubeh route. For further details with regard to the country see notes on these routes (25 a, 31),22 RIVER ROUTES The country between the lineBeled—Sindiyeh —From the neighbourhood of Beled up to Samarra the Tigris cuts a trench through undulating plains of clay, shingle, and sand with scattered outcrops of limestone. These plains stretch away from the 1. bank to the Hamrln Hills some 40 m. to the NE., and extend from the r. bank to the edge of the desert plateau. On the r. bank the most noticeable feature is the complicated network of canals (mostly dry or almost dry) which stretch W. and NW. of Beled to the mouth of the Dujeil, above which an old canal-bed (Nahr Shaqi ?) runs parallel with the river (see m. 81^). On the 1. bank are the beds of the large ancient canals of the Nahrawan system (Nahr er-Rasasi, Nahr el-Qa'im, and Nahr Talsiyeh) with the remains of numerous cross-cuttings : and in the neighbourhood of Samarra (see m. 83^) appear the numerous ruins which for the most part date from the ninth century a.d ., during which that city was the capital of the Caliphate. The banks are sparsely inhabited, but there are patches of cultivation near them mostly dependent on rain, and in the plain between Samarra and the 'Adheim winter crops are raised by the Arabs with the aid of ancient wells. Sheep and cattle are fairly numerous. Inhabitants. —The inhabitants of both banks are settled Arabs of various tribes, though some of their communities still live in tents for the whole of the year or during the summer. Near Baghdad the land is held by various wealthy landowners : on the Dujeil and round Samarra it is mostly Turkish Government property. On the Right Bank Baghdad. Date plantations.

The desert W. of the southern part of this route is usually occupied by Dilaim ; but the Shammar are the predominant tribe in the interior in this region. The Shammar were apparently in recent years somewhat more under the control of the Turkish administration than that part of the tribe living farther to the N. which acknowledged the sons of Faris. Their sheikhs (the family of Ferhan Pasha) had been reduced to the position of proteges of the Turkish Government, and the fact that so much of the land in the Dujeil district and in the neighbour hood of Samarra is Government property seems to have given protection to the settled Arabs against the levying of tribute or blackmail ililiuhheh) by the Shammar. On the 1. bank the inhabitants are chiefly Jebur, with some Juheish, Beni Tamim, Mujammeh, and fragments of other tribes. When the Kurds were .giving trouble their raids sometimes pene trated as far south as this region. It may be noticed that while the Arabs of the r. bank are mainly Sunnis, most of the inhabitants of the 1. bank from Baghdad at least to Sindiyeh and Jeizani (see m. 46f) are Shiah.

It flows in a valley from m. to 1| m. wide and 65 ft. deep. In December 1904 it was reported as having a depth of about 4 ft. and a current of 1 to 1^ m. per hour; in h.w. both depth and velocity must be much greater; but in l.w the river dries up altogether. Followed up-stream its course runs NNE. to the foot of the Hamrln Hills ( T 40 m.),then K, and NNW. to near Kirkuk. The river leaves the hills by a broken dam and cuts its way through the flat plain to the Tigris. Large areas of wheat and barley are still cultivated in this plain if the rains are favourable, but since the bursting of the Hamrln dam there has been no irrigation in the country-side, and the river near its mouth has broken through the dry course of the Nahrawan. The 'Adheim adds considerably to the volume of the Tigris. Report, 1892, mentions Khan Dliulu iyeh (Khan Dh ulei'ah ?) as a large khan on 1. bank 1 m. above the mouth of the 'Adheim. In this neighbourhood the dry course of the old Nahrawan Canal is resumed on the 1. bank, here called Nahr er- Rasasi. 1 m. WNW. of the khan the course of the main bed of the Nahrawan Canal turns NW., while a branch, called Nahr el-Qa'im, continues to follow the 1. bank of the river. Between them lies a swampy area into which streams from the hills flow in h.w., breaking up the line of the Nahrawan Canal. At the same point another dry canal, the ancient Nahr el-Batt, enters the Nahrawan from the NNE,, and in the angle so formed are the ruins of Tel Mahasil {? part of the ruins of Opis. See m. 49.) The Nahr el-Batt is a relic of the ancient irrigation system of this region. Im mediately above the Hamrln dam (see under m 59^) two canals were taken off on either side, which carried the waters of the Adheim, blocked by the dam, into the Tigris at different points.

There is a railway station of Beled. The village is apparently visible from the river at a point somewhat higher up. In this neighbourhood Harbeh Canal takes off from the r. bank and runs SE. past Beled ; it is crossed by a bridge carrying the Baghdad—Samarra road, about 6 m. from river.

The lower part of the dry Nahrawan Canal is traceable on the 1. bank of the Tigris below Kut el-Amara and Azlziyeh. For its course thence to the Diyaleh see vol. ii. It reaches the 1. bank of that river near Sifweh. {Route 31, m. 23|) and follows it to BaqSbeli (23 m.), crossing to r. bank below Bahriz. Above Baqubeh it turns NW. to the Tigris (15 m.), its bed being broken by branches of the Khalis Canal. Striking the 1. bank a little above Sindiyeh (m. 49, above) it follows it more or less closely as far as the 'Adheim and Khan DhulxTiyeh as described in the preceding paragraphs. Its bed thus far is 100-140 yds. wide, and at the { Adheim it is 20 ft. below the surface-level. Above the Khan the main canal, diverging from the river as described above (p. 31), is almost obliterated. Deep cuts interrupt its bed, which is on the level of the plain.

About 8 m. above Samarra compact conglomerate is reached, through which canal is cut with steep banks; galleries sloping up them from the bed to the surface for the removal of excavated material may be traced. The bed is below the general level, and banks 15 ft. above it and 15 yds. thick.

Possibly, however, the Sidd Nimrud was merely an irrigation dam. About | ni. above Sidd Nimrud and El-Hawiyeh is a ferry by which communication is possible between the Baghdad— Samarra routes on the r. and 1. bank respectively. The normal service here is reported as being one of three boats, each capable of carrying 50-60 persons. A hut and two or three sheds on the r. bank.

The distances in this section of the river are very uncertain. They are based on the times given by various authorities who descended the river by raft, and as the speed at which a raft moves may vary greatly with changes in the rate of the current or the wind, it is impossible on such evidence to estimate mileage with any approach to precision. For most of the way between Mosul and Samarra the Tigris flows in a shallow valley through rolling plain country.

The river here varies in breadth from 370 to 460 yds., according to the season. Its current in mean water is 3 m. an hour. Its depth is considerable: reliable details on this point are lacking. The 1. bank is high (60-80 ft. above the river in l.w.), and shuts off the view of the town from the Tigris. The r. bank is said to be about 30 ft. high and steep. The banks and river bottom are mainly firm earth, with some sand (mostly on r. bank) and a few stones. Samarra and 120 miles from Mosul, by the Jebel Hamrin, a range of rugged heights rising to 300-500 ft., through which the river forces its way after running for some distance along the NW. side of the hills. The Tigris flows over a bed mainly of shingle, with outcrops of rock. The river frequently breaks up into two or more channels, p Opplf enclosing low islands often overgrown with tamarisk and other ritiesscrub. These islands are specially numerous between Mosul and the mouth of the Great Zab. The rocks in the river-bed are often ^'verT and stand up out of the water or are barely covered by it. 'iih*# hedges of shingle, stretching across the channels between islands clevil'* &lt;ind the banks, and forming rapids, are common. Where it flows in a single channel, the river is in the flood season generally 400-550 yds. broad from Samarra up to the neighbourhood of the , 'MGreat Zab, where it is said to narrow to 200-250 yds. In l,w, its trisf breadth in places may decrease considerably (see, e, g., m, 31, under Ttl i- The current varies considerably according to the width and ffl li ^ ie 1 ^ ver &gt; an d the time of year.

Navigation. —Native sailing-craft do not usually go above Samarra, the current being too strong in h.w. In Lw. they could reach Tekrit by carrying half-cargoes. Practically all the river-traffic in this stretch is down-stream, and is carried on by means of the large rafts known as Jceleks (see vol. i, p. 166). Times taken by these rafts vary greatly according to the condition of the river, the wind, &amp;c. A raft in May (h.w.) 1910 descended the river from Mosul to Samarra in about 30 hours' travelling (exclusive of stops). At the end of August (l.w.) the journey has taken 70 hours' travelling (exclusive of stops). The numerous rapids, rocks, and islands make night-travelling dangerous, at least when there is no moon. In the l.w. season it might perhaps be possible for steamers of 3 ft. draught to navigate the river as far as the Hamrln Hills. A German archaeologist at Qal'ah Sherghat said in 1910 that he had found a place below Qal'ah Sherghat where in the low season there, was not more than half a metre (about 19 in.) of water anywhere in the river. This may have been due to shingle ledges forming rapids (see e, g. under m. 63). Native raftmen asserted in 1910 that at each of the fords across the Tigris in this section there is always a part in which the water is breast high. Steamers could probably go considerably higher than the Hamrln Hills in a full river, except perhaps at the highest of the flood, when the current at rapids might be too strong for them. In 1839 one of Chesney's steamers, the Euphrates (3 ft. draught), ascended the river as far as Sultan Abdallah (m. 144). Motor-launches could probably be used throughout this section even in low water. The navigation of the river is apparently subject to fairly frequent modification, as the main volume of the water may shift from one channel to another, and shingle ledges may be altered as the result of the annual floods. The rocks are the most serious danger to navigation, and rafts are not infrequently wrecked in the descent of the river. The rapids formed by shingle ledges are generally easy in the h.w. season. For rocks, see m. 19|, 201, 2If, 24i, 69^ 97, 98, 131^, 149, 150, 152|. For rapids, see m. 47, 63, 66, 76f, 92-|, 110-|, 149^, 154^, 159^. See also m. 162|.

The natives, when crossing the Tigris singly, swim the river, supported on two inflated skins tied together. The Banks and River Valley. —The banks are formed generally of sandstone or conglomerate, and sometimes of gypsum or (as above Tekrit) of sandy alluvium. They are generally fairly high, occa sionally rising to bluffs or cliffs as the river approaches the side of the valley. From the Fet-hah gorge up to a few miles below QaFah Sherghat the steep and broken sides of the JebelHamrln rise abruptly from the river, first on both banks (in the gorge above mentioned) and farther up on the r. bank only. The hill-ridges or plateau-edge , on the W. side of the valley are usually -|-2 m. from the river. The banks are intersected at intervals by wad is. Strips of flat ground, covered with alluvium, occur along the banks. A small alluvial plain of this kind is known locally as hmvi. Patches of cultivation are found near the river : water-lifts (cherrads) are in use between Samarra and Tekrit. Cultivation in the valley is poor and sporadic throughout the greater part of the section, but becomes comparatively frequent on both banks from the confluence of the Great Zab to Mosul. Where there is no cultivation, the valley is either bare or overgrown with tamarisk and camel-thorn. A few miles above Tekrit, and in a good many places N. of the Jebel Hamrln, good pasture is found in spring. There are very few trees, and no date-palms occur between Tekrit and Mosul. Along the E. side of the valley, S. of the Jebel Hamrln, run the large dry canal- beds of the Nahrawan (Nahr er-Easasi) and the Nahr en-Neifeh (see m. 17^ and m. 56).

N. of the Jebel Hamrln the Jezlreh has less of a desert character : there is good spring-grazing in the rolling country between the river and the Wadi Tartar.

Up to the confluence42 RIVER ROUTES of the Tigris and the Great Zab permanent villages are few, and, with the exception of Dur (see m. 20|) and Tel esh-Sha'ir (m. 145|), insignificant. A number of nomad encampments are generally to be found near the river, especially in summer, and there are apparently settlements of semi-nomads, which after remaining for some years are liable to alter their position or to disappear alto gether. The settled and semi-nomad inhabitants of the r. bank are for the most part Jebur Arabs, who pay a tribute to the powerful nomad Shammar. The influence of the Shammar, who formerly controlled the r. bank of the Tigris from Mosul to Baghdad, has been lately declining. But acts of brigandage were still committed here Samarra.

The city of Asshur was the capital of the Assyrian kingdom before the rise of Calah (Nimrud, see under m. 159^) and Nineveh (opposite Mosul). Its position in a cultivable plain close to the Jebel Hamrln, which com manded the approach to Assyria along the Tigris from Babylonia, made Asshur a convenient royal residence in the earlier period of Assyrian history. With the expansion of the Assyrian Empire to N., NW., and W. the place of Asshur as the political capital of the country was taken by Calah, but it continued to be a religious centre and a place of some importance as late as the Parthian Empire (first century b .c.-third century a.d.).

The surface is all bitumen, in places hard, in places viscous, in places soft; and there are oozings here and there of sulphurous water.

In 1908 there were various competitors for a lease of the springs, including a European firm. The present plant is primitive and the buildings are of little value.

N. by E.). On the course of the river through the mountains from Bash Qal e ah to the region of Amadiyeh (about T 85 m. to N.) see route from Mosul to Van. Below the comparatively open valley of Amadiyeh it flows in a SE. direction, through a fertile, well-wooded district bordered by rocky ridges, and the S. side of the valley is followed by the route from Amadiyeh to Bireh Kafra (or Zibar). But below the junction of the Zab with its tributary the Rudbar-i Shin the valley narrows again, and is left by the above-mentioned route, which turns southward away from the river. Some *11 m. to the SE. of this point the Zab passes by the small plain of Bireh Kafra or Zibar on its r., and then enters very difficult gorges. About T 19 m., *28 m., below the plain of Zibar, some way above its junction with its tributary the Rowanduz Chai, it turns S., and shortly below Rowanduz takes a general SW. direction. Below the gorge near Berdin ( T 65 m. from the Tigris) it enters a broader valley, and flows between low hills on its r. bank and on its 1. hills which steadily decline in height. About 2 m. above Grirdamamik ferry (*42 m. from the Tigris) the river bends in a general SSE. direction to the Tigris. The largest tributaries of the Zab join its 1. bank between Amadiyeh and Berdin, but in its lower course it receives many affluents on both banks, the most considerable of which on the r. bank are the £ Aqreh Su (about 54 m. above the mouth of the Zab) and the larger stream of the Ghazir Su (about *18 m. above the mouth of the Zab) : between these two rivers the Achair Dagh hills run along the r. bank of the Zab. The chief tributaries on the 1. bank are, between Zibar and the mouth of the river, the Rukuchuk, the Rudbar-i-Baras-glr, the Rudbar-i-Rowanduz, the Darabikush Chai, and the Bastoreh Chai. All these rivers are themselves fed by numerous smaller streams. The Zab between the Berdin gorge and the Tigris flows in a broad shingly bed with outcrops of rock here and there, and enclosing a con tinuous network of islands which break up the river into many channels. Below the mouth of the Ghazir Su this bed appears to be 2-3 m. wide, but its channels are not entirely covered except in the spring floods. The amount of water in the Zab and its tributaries varies much according to the season : rain and the melting of the snow on the Kurdish hills in spring fill them with a torrential flood. But even in the l.w. season the Zab contains much water, though the width of its bed in this lower part of its course makes it run shallow. Its current is always swift, so that apparently even in 1. w. it is difficult to ford. The Zab between the Berdin gorge and its mouth is crossed by four ferries. These are (i) at Quweir (described as 2 hrs. above the mouth of the Zab ; (ii) at Eski Kelek (about 25 m. from the mouth) where the Erbil—Mosul route crosses the Zab ; (iii) at Girdamamik (about 42 m. from the mouth) and at Qandil (raft ferry) (about 65 m. from the mouth).70 EIVER ROUTES Bold rocky cliffs, called Jebel Mishraq, about 150 ft. high Sanadiq ('boxes') mounds extend NNW. for about 5 m, Channel followed r. bank in May 1910, past green island.

The hill is now a rect angular plateau running N. and S., the longer side extending nearly 750 yds., the shorter side about 325 yds. The surface of the plateau is uneven, being covered with ruined mounds. At the NW. corner is a conspicuous cone-shaped mound cut72 KIVER ROUTES Rapid, which is reported as giving no trouble to rafts in h. w., and easily passed even in 1. w. (This rapid would appear to be near the site of the dam called the SSikr el-'Awaz, which was formerly described as just above 'Uneifeh and 20 miles below Mosul. The most recent information avail able seems to indicate that this ancient dam no longer forms an obstacle, but no evidence could be obtained to show whether it had been destroyed or was now avoided by the present channel of the river. An authority of 1892 gives the following account of the dam:— 'The channel is 330 yds. wide, the dam being of square blocks of stone set in cement much worn away. It causes a drop of about 2 ft., which rafts can always get over, but with shaking to the skins. In April, however, the river was so full that there was not a trace of it to be felt. Another channel runs farther west, which avoids the obstruction, and at the low season forms a back-water, withTHE TIGRIS—KOUTE HIE Left Bank into by a deep trench, rising 110 ft. above the plain and about 70 ft. above the plateau. The mound is the ruin of a great tower of unburnt brick faced with stone. It was built by Assur-bani-pal. There are other mounds at the SW. and SE. corners of the plateau, the most noticeable being that at the SE. Besides the trenches dug by exca vators several deep indentations mark the sides of the hill. These indicate the position of ascents or stairways. The largest of these is on the western side of the hill, about 70 yds. S. of the cone-shaped mound. It is about 20 to 30 yds. broad, and runs for about 160 yds. into the plateau. Other indentations occur in the centre of the southern face of the plateau and in the eastern side. The ground to the and KE. of the hill is covered with ruin-mounds. In preference to Asshur (see m. 109 above) Calah was chosen for the centre of the Assyrian Empire by kings who were engaged in war to the N. and NE. and in Northern Mesopotamia and Northern Syria, Eventually its place was taken by Nineveh T 20 m. to the N.

There are two sulphur springs, walled in and covered with cupolas; the temperature is said to be 4:7 0 -48 0 C. The water is of a dirty green colour, has a bituminous scum floating on the surface, and smells strongly of sulphur. From the middle of June to middle of September the baths are visited by about 10,000 patients, who come from as far as Zakho in the N., Kirkuk and Suleimaniyeh on the E., and Baghdad on the S.

A., vol. iii, 1904 (report of 1892); E. B. Soane, Through Mesopotamia and Kurdistan in (journey in 1909). The details regarding the channel, &amp;c., are taken from an authority who descended the river by raft from Taktak in 1. w. (October) 1892. It is probable that the channel has altered considerably and many of the rapids formed by shingle ledges have shifted their position since that date. It is to be remembered that the depths were taken in the season of lowest water.

In low water, where the numerous shingle or rock ledges obstruct the channel, depths of .,,0: only 2 ft., 18 in, or even 1 ft. are found: elsewhere the river has 4-6 ft. of water in the low season. The increase in depth caused by the yearly floods is considerable, though much of the flood water spreads over the wide stretch of shingle, which in most places lies on one side or on both sides of the main channel. A raft, assisted by oars, moves 3-3^ m. an hour in 1. w. ; but in this respect also the difference made by the flood is probably great. The breadth of the river in this part of its course is generally 200-100 yds. in low water,78 KIVEK ROUTES where it flows in a single channel: in flood-time its breadth is generally much greater, and in places may be 1 m. or more. Before the war the Lesser Zab was navigated only down-stream by the large rafts called heleks (see vol. i, p. 166). A raft in August took three days from Altun Kopril to the Eiver Tigris, this time in cluding stops for the night. In low water it is impossible to run by night. Above Taktak a sandstone ledge forming a fall of 2 ft., and other obstructions, are said to make navigation impossible. From Taktak to its junction with the Tigris the river flows between banks of conglomerate or earth over a bed of shingle or sand. In the river-bed there are very numerous ledges consisting either of sandstone or, less commonly, of conglomerate, which form rapids. Eocks occur in the channel occasionally : these latter would probably be nearly or wholly submerged in high water. The river frequently divides into two or more channels, enclosing flat shingle , islands, many of which are probably under water in flood time. Along the sides of the main channel there generally extend broad stretches of shingle which are covered by the floods. The banks frequently rise to bluffs 20-50 ft. in height, which occasionally come close to the edge of the low-water channel. Between the mouth of the Zab and the neighbourhood of Shamagheh (see m. 571) the country on either side of the river is a gently undulating plain with a few scattered rising from it. On the S.

The undulations gradually become more frequent as the river is followed up-stream, and between the neighbourhood of Shamagheh and Altun Koprii (m. 74) the Zab flows in an open valley between low, bare hill-ranges. Above Altun Koprti as far as Taktak the valley remains fairly open, though the hills gradually increase in height. In the plains below Altun Kopru there are a number of scattered settlements on the banks, mostly small villages or encampments of semi-nomad Jebur, who cultivate the soil here and there, chiefly for millet and melons; in places cherrads are used. In 1892 Jaif was said to be the first Kurdish village passed on the up-stream journey. From about that point onwards the inhabitants of the banks are Kurds and Turkomans. When the hills are reached the country becomes better watered, and the Zab between the neighbourhood of Altun Koprii and Taktak receives a number of tributaries, most of which, however, appear to be nearly or quite dry by the early autumn. There appears to be no serious obstacles to movement along the banks of the Zab up to Altun Kopru, but no appreciable amount of supplies or fuel could be found, and grazing could be expected only in spring. Water is probably very scarce away from the river. (For the road from Altun Koprtl to Taktak, see lioute 40.)

GENERAL INTEODUCTION ON THE EIVEE BETWEEN EELLtJJEH AND MESKENEH Details must be sought in the river itinerary. The evidence there given, however, does not represent the 1. w. conditions, the journey on the report of which they are based (Dobbs) having been undertaken in January, when the Euphrates was swollen by un usually heavy winter rains, the effect of which was observable as far as Deir-ez-Zor. From -there to Fellujeh the conditions may be regarded as normal for the winter months (during Dobbs's journey the river in this section was somewhat below normal winter level). The narrowest part of the river is in the Halebi Chelebi defile (see Boute IV H, m. 47). The River. —The breadth of the river on this stretch is generally 200-500 yds. In Jan., 1903, when the river above Deir was higher than is usual at this time of year, depths were found ranging from 4 to 12 ft. The current varied from 2 m.p.h. to 12 m.p.h. (at Fatihat: Boute IV F, m. 58^). In several places it ran at 7 m. an hour in two or more channels enclosing low islands. Above Hit the river contains a number of rapids caused by ledges of rock or broken masonry bridges. Banks of shingle or sand are also found. In the 1. w. season there are probably fords at several places on this part of the river, but there is no recent information with regard to their position. The bed from Fellujeh to Hit is alluvial soil. Above Hit it is shingle, sand, or mud, with outcrops of rock up to El-Qa'im. Navigation. —It was reported in 1903 that in the months of April, May, June, and July, when the river is full, the descent of the riverTHE EUPHKATES 93 would be easy for a light-draught steamer, and could be accomplished at a very great speed. The swiftness of the current at this time of the year would, however, make the upward journey very slow, and it would be necessary for the steamer to be capable of a continuous speed of not less than 12 knots per hour in order to make head against the rapid stretch between Hit and Anah. Steamer-navigation, it was stated, would be too risky to be profitable during the l.-w. months of August, September, Octobei', and November. The report adds that in the months of December, January, February, and March both the upward and downward journey of even a light-draught steamer would be attended with considerable risk unless engineering works were carried out in the stretches between Hadiseh IV F, m. 65) and Alus {Route IV F, m. 55|), in the passage from Kerableh Island {Boute IV Gr, m. 2) to below Anah IV F, m. 117), in the shallow rapids at Abu Quba'l or Funsa IV H, m. 120), and below the islands of El-Hammam IV H, m. 130|). In the first two of the above-mentioned places the artificial channel excavated by the Turkish authorities in 1870 was in 1903 still almost intact; and it was believed that very heavy expense would not be necessary. Some apparatus would, however, have to be erected for the purpose of warping the steamer up over the ledge at Fatihat Khidhr Ilyas {Boute IV F, m. 5&amp;|). From below Anah to above Kerableh Island a tow-path would probably have to be con structed on the 1. side of the river. In the neighbourhood of Abu Quba'l and El-Hammam, the placing of four or five dams part of the way across the river-bed would sufficiently deepen the channel. The report of 1903 says that the best boatmen of Anah are so intimately acquainted with the bed of the river above Hit that it would be advisable to secure the services of one of them as pilot for a steamer plying on the river. On the upward journey it might be possible for a steamer to tow one or two flat-bottomed boats. On the journey down-stream towing would be dangerous, but a barge might be lashed to the side of a steamer. Practically all the present traffic is down-stream, at least as far as Hit, and is carried on chiefly by the flat-bottomed boats, known as shakhturs (see vol. i, p. 167), built only at Birijik. Even the attempt made in 1911 to establish a service of motor-boats (65 ft. long with about 2-| ft. draught) on the river above Fellujeh had to be given up owing to difficulties in navigation. (See vol. i, p. 171.) There are ferries at the chief stopping-places on the river. The river has been used in increasing degree for the transport of guns, ammunition, and stores, and small detachments of troops from94 THE EUPHRATES Jerablus to Fellujeh during the present war. The Germans claim to have improved the navigation. There is reliable evidence that special craft have been constructed (compare p. 396). Banks. —Between Fellujeh and Hit IV E) the 1. bank appears to be stony desert, with little or no cultivation. On the r. bank there is cultivation by water-lifts Above Hit, as far as Nahiyeh, chermds are replaced by (water-wheels), but the strip of cultivation is very narrow and no grain is available for export. Between Nahiyeh and Abu Kemal both banks are prac tically uninhabited, and either bare or covered only by tamarisk scrub. Between Abu Kemal and Deir ez-Zor IV G, m. 192) there is almost continuous cultivation by means of but the cultivated strip in no case reaches more than -J m. from the bank. Between Deir ez-Zor and Sabkhah cultivation to J m. from the river on either side is carried on intermittently by In 1903 no grain available for export was produced in this region. Above Sabkhah to Abu Hureireh there is hardly any cultivation except in the delta of the Belikh on the 1. bank in the neighbourhood of Eaqqah. The low hills on the bank are of marl, and the valley is covered with a dense growth of tamarisk, bramble, and liquorice. Above Abu Hureireh there is a fertile belt 1-3 m. broad, bordered by marl or gypsum hills, which produces wheat and barley without irrigation. See also Routes 46, 47 for the river valley. The terms Shamiyeh (esh-Sham = Damascus) and Jezlreh are used by the inhabitants for right and left bank respectively. Inhabitants. —The permanent inhabitants of the Euphrates Valley are mainly either fellahln or semi-settled Arabs, who are more or less liable to be raided or blackmailed by the great nomadic tribes of the desert, the principal of which are the Anazeh, Dilaim, and Shammar. The predominant tribe in the Syrian Desert W. of the river is that of the Anazeh, though some of the subdivisions of that tribe are also found on the 1. bank. The Anazeh are large camel-breeders, and their sheikhs own a certain amount of land in the Euphrates Valley. They have a constant antagonism to the Shammar. The Amarat division of the Anazeh are found W. of the Euphrates between Kerbela and Hit, where their paramount chief, Ibn Hadhdhal, owns palm gardens. They are generally near the Euphrates in summer. The Ped'an division of. the Anazeh (paramount chiefs, the pan-Arab Ibn Muheid and Ibn Geshirsh) ranges from Deir to Aleppo on both sides of the Euphrates and up the Khabur Valley. The Amarat and also the Sba' division of the Anazeh (from the region of Palmyra) may be driven into the Ped'an country by lack of pasture elsewhere.THE EUPHEATES 96 The Dilaim are a powerful tribe found in the desert on both sides of the river from Fellujeh almost to Anah. They own cultivated land in the Euphrates Valley (their paramount chief, 'Ali Suleiman, has a house and palm garden at Eamadiyeh), and are sheep-breeders on a large scale, but not camel-breeders. They are in close alliance with the Amarat Anazeh, and at feud with the Shammar of the Jezlreh to the N. and the Shiah tribes of Irak to the S. They are noted robbers. The western division of the northern Shammar, the predominant tribe of the Jezlreh, is found near and north of Deir, and along and W. of the Khabur. The leading sheikhs of this western division are the sons of Abdul Mehsin and Mohammed. In 1911 Asi, son of Ferhan, was appointed paramount chief of all the Mesopotamian Shammar : he keeps to the Mosul district. The half-settled tribes of the Euphrates Valley cultivate the soil more or less, but retain to varying degrees the traces of their former nomadic habits. Most of them spend at least the summer in tents. Even where villages have been built they are liable to be abandoned and to reappear on new sites. The half-settled Arabs form large tribes, but they play little or no part in the politics of the desert, and are usually obliged to pay tribute to the nomads. The following half-settled tribes may be mentioned: the Yeghaifeh (from Anah to Irsi), the Bu Kemal (Irsi to Meyaddln), the Abu Mueyt and Abu Hleyhil (round Meyaddln), the Baggarah (in summer near Deir, a despised tribe), the Afadle (in winter W. of the Belikh), the Qeys (near the Belikh and up-stream to above Meskeneh), the Weldeh (in summer near Qal'ah Jabir), the Ugeydat (scattered from the Khabur to Damascus, accounted base-born by the Bedouin). The 'Ugeil (caravan men and guides of Arabia) are much employed in the caravan traffic between the Euphrates and Syria. For the inhabitants of the towns see Gazetteer96 JD JCjJUU Ud XLiXi XIJLJL ivi.

The Saqlawiyeh Canal used to take water from the Euphrates to the Tigris at Baghdad, but was closed to protect Baghdad from floods.

There is a khan on rising ground apparently about 1^ m. from the river, with post and telegraph station just S. of it, the barracks lying to the N. There were about a dozen here in 1908. Water-supply is partly from one or two wells, but chief supply from river. Some scrub and camel dung available for fuel. As many as 20,000 sheep have been counted in this neighbourhood in January feeding in the valley. Excellent pasturage was found in 1907 on the wide meadows between the post and the river.

Via Salahiyeh (Kufri), Kirkuk, and Erbil, Authorities:—Military Report on E.T.A., vol. iii, 1904 (Report of 1903); Lorimer Report of a Tour in Turkish Arabia and Koute Report of 1910; Petermanns Mittheilungen, Erganzungsbd. x, 1875-6 (Cernik's journey of 1873) ; and other sources of information. This was the usual route followed by troops before the present war. With some slight repairs and with some bridging it could be made easily passable for transport and field-guns throughout. It leads for the most part through fairly populous, well-cultivated, and well-watered country, and a number of considerable towns. The chief difficulties are to be found in the numerous irrigation cuts between Baghdad and Delli 'Abbas (these are chiefly on the Western Koute, see (ii) below), in some of the wadis and large torrent-beds crossed between Salahiyeh and Kirkuk, and in the crossing of the Great Zab. From Baghdad to Delli 'Abbas there are two possible routes: (i) an Eastern Route via Baqubeh, and (ii) a Western Eoute Jedeideh and Khan Nahravvan. The Eastern Eoute appears to be the better. (i) The Eastern Route to Delli 'Abbas As far as Baqubeh this is a caravan road easy for wheeled vehicles except in rain. Beyond Baqubeh it was reported in 1910 to be fit for guns, though only pack-animals were used on it: in this section it was rough in places, where, however, it could be improved con siderably by a little pick and shovel work: the soil is sandy and going would be heavy after rain.LAND EOUTES—ROUTE 25 a 143 Miles from Baghdad o Baghdad.

Cross several irrigation canals, some 6 ft. deep and 10 ft. wide, with small bridges of date trunks, about 3 ft. wide. These bridges will generally carry a laden mule, but it is well to examine before using them and test them first by men on foot. Walled gardens on 1. for 2 m.; cultiva tion on both sides for 4 m.

The first khan reached on entering the village is about 80 yds. square, with stabling for 200 horses, having a well in the centre, with water 20 ft. below the surface. The other khan, near the river, is 60 yds. square, with stabling for 100 horses. To NE. are numerous villages along the Nahr Khalis, and canal from the Diyaleh. Small canals cross the road flowing towards Hawesh. Beyond the principal khan the track lies through walled date gardens for a mile. Ground swampy in winter and spring from irrigation.

Desert route to Tuz Khurmatli and Kirkuk diverges to N. leading ma Qarfeli (21 m, ?), the Band-i- c Adheim on the 'Adheim River (46 m. ?) through the Hamrln Hills by the Demir Qapu defile, and thence by r. bank of e Adheim River to Tuz Klmrmatli (73 m. ?), whence the main Baghdad—Mosul route is followed to Kirkuk (see below, m. 142i). Supplies and water between Nahrawan and Tuz Khurmatli are deficient, the country bein^ mainly desert. Qarfeh is a small village lying near some salt pools. There appears to bo no permanently inhabited place between Qarfeh and Mufti Khan at the S. end of the Demir Qapu valley. Route passes through cultivation, interspersed with thorn bushes. Cross an irrigation channel, 5 ft. wide by 4 ft. deep.

W. of this village is the head of the Khorasan Canal which flows in a SW. direction to Baqubeh, watering the country on the SE. of the Diyaleh River). About 1 m. N. of Mansuriyeh the Diyaleh issues from a narrow defile through the Hamrin range, which extends for about ^6 m. to the N. There is no frequented route through the defile, the most southern part of which is described as quite impassable for about m. There appears to be a track turning this part of the defile to the W. : but no information with regard to its practicability is available. The central K 2148 LAND EOUTES Miles from Baglidaci 72 73 76 portion of the defile is also very difficult, and is reported to be probably quite impracticable when the Diyaleh is in flood. At the N. end of the defile the course of the Diyaleh River as one goes up-stream, turns in a NE. direction, and at this point it is joined by the Nahrin Su, which flows from the NNW. along the foot of the NE. side of the Hamrin Hills. Qizil Eibat lies about v 9 m. NNE. of Mansuriyeh beyond the Hamrin range, on the 1. bank of the Diyaleh Eiver and on the Baghdad—Khanikin road (see 28 a, m. 75). The section of this route lying between Qizil Eibat and Shahraban passes 2 or 3 m. to the E. of Mansuriyeh. Mileage below calculated from Eoute (ii) to Delli 'Abbas. The Mosul route takes a northerly direction from Delli 'Abbas over slightly undulating desert. To W. is a marshy stream flowing to join the Khalis Canal near Delli Abbas. To E. the Jebel Hamrln appears about 4 m. distant. The T. L. takes same general direction as the route, but apparently runs some distance W. of the usual track. The ground is boggy in places owing to a broken water- cut. Cross dry nullah. Cross line of small hillocks. Enter a valley in red sandstone hills called Jebel Hamrin, which close in. Ascent gradual. The ground near the road is very broken, conforming in this to the general character of this side of the Hamrln Hills. Sharp bend in valley, Qishlaq. Suhaniyeh, fortified police post in ruins in 1903. (In 1910 there was a police post hereabouts, said to be m. from Delli c Abbas, containing 15 men : it had one well.) Small stream, slightly brackish but drinkable. Only a few inches of water in January 1903, Ravine 20 yds. wide, 20 ft. deep, with a pebbly bottom. Boundary between Baghdad and Mosul Vilayets runs in the neighbourhood. An authority states that between this point and the highest ridge about 5 m, distant lies a series of small parallel crests rising to a height of 30-35 ft, above Suhaniyeh at intervals of 175-250 yds. Another authority says that the hillocks rise to not more than 200 ft. above the track. For the next 5 m, the route winds among the undulating spurs of the Jebel Hamrln till the summit of the pass,ROUTE 25 a 149 600 ft. above the plain, is reached. The last 100 yds. of the ascent are steep and pebbly. T.L. rejoins the route near this point. (One account makes the ascent to summit of the pass 6 m.) Descent on N. side of Jebel Hamrln begins. This is much easier than the ascent on 'the S. side, and the route pre sents no difficulty for guns. Good grazing ground (in spring ?) on this slope of the hills was reported in 1873. Enter open cultivated plain, the valley (8 m. wide) of the Nahrin Su, which flows SE. to the Diyaleh. (One account makes the descent from the pass 3 m. in length.) Eoad boggy in wet weather. Nahrin Koprii: brick bridge across Nahrin Su: five arches in^ fair repair. Channel 60 yds. wide, but little water (25 ft. wide) in January 1903. In the winter of 1909- 1910 water 50 ft. wide, 6 ft. deep. (One account places this bridge 5 m. from summit of pass and 2 m. from foot of hills.) Two villages, both called Mahrin, f m. from the bridge, containing together 300 houses well built of mud. Four or five villages of about 60 houses each higher up valley. The valley of the Nahrin is fertile in this region and fairly well cultivated (the crops were chiefly millet in 1873), but has suffered from Kurdish raids. About 12 m. above the bridge the Kufri Su enters it from the NE'. Above the junction of the Kufri Su with the Nahrin Su the valley runs up NNW. between the rangee of the Jebel Hamrln and the Kufri Dagh, and becomes bare of cultivation for about 22 m., and for the most part uninhabited. Though it becomes narrower it is still some miles broad; its floor rises in a gradual slope from about 500 to about 750 ft. towards its head: the Hamrin Hills on the 1. rise to nearly 1,200 ft., and the Kufri Dagh on the r. to about 1,000 ft., at their highest points. The valley is entered by a number of streams, which join the main channel along the bottom of the valley, here called Chinchal Dereh or Neft Dereh. The bed of this main channel is reported as only occasionally containing water, but there is much naphtha in it, as also in the hills to the N. In the upper part of the valley (possibly 18-20 m. NNW. of the mouth of the Kufri Su) appears to lie a large village of Biyat Arabs. About 21 m. from the Kufri Su junction (in the neighbourhood of another Biyat village) the valley leads by easy stages into a more populated plain, covex-ed with ruined villages and tombs, and bounded on the NE. by a line of hills (Neft Dagh) at the foot of which runs the Baghdad—Mosul road (17 m. from Kufri, 8i m. from Tuz Khurmatli).LAND ROUTES Qara Tepeh is visible, lying about N. by E. from Nahrln Koprii, but cannot be reached directly owing to swamps. Route goes N. from the bridge. Route bears easterly to— Qara Tepeh, about 300 houses on the SW. slope of the Kufri Dagh. Seat of a Mudir and mptieh post (100 men in 1910). Several gardens on the E. side of the village. More Shiahs than Sunnis among the inhabi tants. One khan (100 x 50 yds.) in good repair (1903) and stabling for 200 horses. The building is of solid brick. Large well-built granary, in the shape of a khan, to the r. Supplies plentiful for small caravans. Sheep and goats obtainable. Good grazing and fuel. Abundant water from wells. Vineyards beyond Qara Tepeh. Numerous streams in this neighbourhood, gravelly downs with plenty of grazing between Qara Tepeh and Kufri. &gt; Numerous flocks of sheep in winter and spring. Track leaves Qara Tepeh, going about NNE. and ascending rolling downs. Cross an irrigation canal, 14 ft. wide, 2 ft. deep (January 1903). Broken brick bridge. Direction about NE. by E. (60°). Top of downs. Track goes about N. by E. Ghemen Koprii : brick bridge of six arches in good repair (January, 1903) over a stream flowing W. (Another account, of 1910, gives five arches.) In January 1903 the water was 18 yds. wide, muddy and sluggish, flowing among reeds. Country in neighbourhood of track between this point and Kufri is well cultivated. Cross a stream flowing SW. to join the Kufri Su. It has little water except in spring. Remains of a brick bridge with only two centre arches standing. The r. bank is steep, the 1. sloping. Banks would need to be repaired for guns. After much rain a bridge would be necessary : no materials locally available. The bed is 80 yds. wide. Cross some broken ground, with small ravines, on leaving the stream. Then across a wide plain of soft sandy loam, with much cultivation on both sides. Several villages of about 50 houses each.EOUTE 25 a 151 Miles from Baghdad 107 Cross the shingly bed (300 yds. wide) of the Kiifri Su (or Chechepan). Little or no water except in flood.

Route crosses some low hills ascending by easy gradients, bearing due N. after 2-3 m. Koad reaches the crest and continues over nearly level ground for about 1^ m., when a gradual descent towards Salahiyeh begins. Cultivated plain. Several villages. In this region ruin field of Eski Kufri. Salahiyeh. (Kufri). For coal in neighbourhood, see p. 371. On leaving Kufri, for the first 8 m. the Mosul road runs WNW. about f m. from the foot of a quartz ridge (Jebel Da'ud) to the r. The height of the ridge is variously estimated at 100-150 ft., and at 500 ft. On the 1. the ground falls gradually to the bottom of the valley. To Tuz Khurmatli and for 5 m. beyond the track is throughout commanded by long-range rifle-fire from the J^bel Da'ud. Troops and transport could march farther away from the hills, but would find the ground softer and would have to close in on the usual track at the wadis mentioned under m. 125 and m. 135. From Kufri to a point 8 m. beyond Tuz Khurmatli the route lies through a grassy undulating country, with several streams and nullahs which usually have gently sloping sides (but see under m. 135). About 4-5 m. to the S. lies the N. edge of the Kufri Dagh, of which this part seems to be known also by the name of Jebel Koruk. The T.L. follows closely the 1. side of the road. In spring there are numerous encampments of Biyat Arabs in this region. Mouth of gorge in the ridge to the r. This contains the shingly bed of the Eioru Su. (200 yds. wide), which on leaving the hills takes a SE. direction. It usually con tains only a few pools of water. The 1. bank is gently sloping and low, the r. higher and steeper. Village of 100 mud-walled houses 3 m. to the 1. (lower down the course of the Koru Su ?). The line of hills on the r. approaches to within 200 yds. of the road. Beaten track, leading N. into the hills, crosses the road152 Miles from ! Baglidad LAND ROUTES in this neighbourhood. It seems possible that it follows the valley of the Koru Su. It is said to lead in 5 hrs. (? tl5 m.) to a settlement near the Aq Su of 1 000 households of Da udiyeh Kurds, whose chief is Samim Bey. These people are apparently warlike semi-nomads. Gharreh Hill on r., with white patch. Hereabouts the floor of the valley apparently slopes to the NW., and there is little or, no cultivation. A branch track takes off to r., leading across hills to Abu Sarkal oil-springs, situated in a maze of rugged ridges and valleys, through which it is difficult to find one's way. There are about seven borings altogether, situated on both sides of a small ravine. Near them stands a small fighting-tower. The springs are said to yield about ten donkey-loads of oil daily, and tie load sells for 2s. to 2s. 4d!. at Tuz Khurmatli. The principal pit is 15 ft. in diameter, and 25-30 ft. deep. The oil is brought up in goat-skins by men who clamber down for it. The springs are the property of the Da 'irat es- In the neighbour hood are some rock dwellings cut in the face of the cliffs, and near the springs is an open plain in the hills. Here were in April 1910 two households of Na'aim Seyyids, who had then been settled here for about thirteen years. From Abu Sarkal a beaten track, made by the oil caravans, leads to Tuz Khurmatli, a distance of about 6 m. Some cultivation. In this neighbourhood a wadi is crossed, at which blasting would be necessary to enable guns to pass. In this neighbourhood the tracks from the valley of the Neft Dereh join the road on the 1. Head of the Neft Dereh valley 2 or 3 m. to the S. Khasradalah, village of Blyat Arabs (100 households), _ 2 m. to the 1. Aq Su (white water) (Av-i-Spi in Kurdish, ZTahr Abyadh in Arabic). This river here fiows in a SW. direction over a gravelly bed, f m. wide, usually containing little or no water. Its banks are easy and about 15 ft. high, the left being the higher. Usually the stream is easily fordable, but it rises rapidly, and is dangerousKOUTE 25 a 153 Miles from Baghdad 142i when swollen with rain or melted snow, for there are several holes in the bed. It may in a few hours become a broad and impassable torrent, and then with equal rapidity sink to fordable dimensions. Men and horses are sometimes drowned in it. On the 1. bank are three water-channels, each 6 ft. wide and 10 ft. deep, with a small brick bridge about 4 ft. wide over each. Smaller water-cuts without bridges occur between the river and Tuz Khurmatli. The Aq Su has its head near Kitshan on the S. slope of the Qara Dagh, apparently about 47 m. ENE. of Tuz Khurmatli, above which place its course lies through low, broken hills, scored by ravines which open into its valley. As it approaches Tuz Khurmatli it flows through a gorge under the comparatively high Neft Dagh on the 1. bank. Much of its water is used for purposes of irri gation in the neighbourhood of Tuz Khurmatli. Below it turns SSW. and flows through a plain to join the 'Adheim Kiver about 11 m. away. Its junction with the 'Adheim is near the edge of the Hamrln Hills, and at the middle of the valley which the latter stream cuts through that range. For the last 5 or 6 m. of its course the Aq Su skirts the S. end of the great marshy area flooded in spring by the 'Adheim and its tributaries. Tuz Khurmatli ('Salt and Dates'). Pop. ? 3,000 (about 600 houses). T.O. ? The town lies at the mouth of the defile between the Neft Dagh and the 'Ali Dagh, which is traversed by the Aq Su. This defile, which leads in the direction of Suleimaniyeh, was guarded by an old fort, now apparently ruinous. The houses are principally mud-built, with some of stone. There are two khans in the centre of the bazaar. One khan has an upper story for half its circumference; but there are no doors, and for windows only holes in the wall. Water scarce in l.-w. ; one spring in hills: grazing good. Fuel plentiful. The plain in the neighbourhood seems to be fairly well cultivated. There is a local industry of some importance in the refining of oil from the adjacent hills. There are about twenty stills outside the town (six working in 1910). Oil is sent to Salahiyeh (Kufri), Kirkuk, and Suleimaniyeh, and occasionally as far as Mosul. A petroleum spring is marked on recent154 LAND KOUTES Miles from Baghdad 1464 1474 149^ 150i 151 maps near the town on the 1. bank of the Aq Su under the Neft Dagh. It seems possible that this is due to a confusion with the Abu Sarkal springs. From a spring S. of the town salt is obtained by evaporation. The working of the salt-pans is Grovernment property. In 1909, 400,000 kilos of salt were taken; and the selling rate was approximately equal to Id. per 100 kilos. The inhabitants are for the most part Turks, with some twenty households of Jews. The place is the centre of a nahiye under a Mudir, and there has been usually a Turkish military post of about 200 men. On leaving Tuz, the route takes a NW. direction (320°), crosses two small nullahs, passes some gardens, and for the first 2^ m. runs through a little cultivation. The hills to the r. are rather lower. The Adheim Eiver, bordered by a great belt of swamp which is flooded in spring, is about 7-8 m. to SW., beyond which the Hamrln Hills are visible. The road is on the whole level and good going as far as Dahuk. Two villages on the plain are passed (1903). Road here is rising. The hills to the r. converge towards the road and die away; but mounds continue near the _ road for 3 m. farther. A1 Bu Sabah village (200 houses of Da'udiyeh Kurds) 2-3 m. SW. by W. of this point. A path crosses the road leading from this village to the Da'udiyeh settle ment to the E. near the Aq Su, mentioned under m.125. Other villages are reported to be visible in the plain to the W. Eoad reaches highest point of the gradual slope which it has been ascending for some miles. Mound on r. of road. Quru Chai, water-course running SW. from the hills on the NE. to the Adheim Eiver, which it joins 9| m. SSW. The Quru Chai is rarely a continuous stream, but rain or melting snow may convert it into a torrent presenting a serious obstacle at least for a few hours. In general character it is similar to the Aq Su. It has a pebbly bed 300 yds. wide, and there was a pool \ m. up-stream from this point in January 1908, while therem EOUTE 25a 155 Miles from Baghdad were several pools in the neighbourhood in April 1910. The banks are quite low and the passage is easy. A second arm of the Quru Chai, about 100 yds. wide, is said to unite with the first at a point a little farther to the W. During the next 10 m. between the Quru Chai and the Dahuk Chai a few water-courses, usually dry and with easy banks, have to be crossed. There are now some low hills to the r., beginning at a few miles dis tance, gradually closing to within 1 m. of the road, as the Dahuk Chai is approached. The road first covers slightly undulating ground and then ascends a long gradual rise. Direction about NNW. About this point a village of Da'udiyeh Kurds under Namuk Agha lies WSW. 2-3 m. distant. It contains about 300 houses. Top of the long rise. In the hills to the E. are some settlements of Da'udiyeh Kurds, one of which is Shoraweh (50 houses) about 1 m. from the top of the long rise above mentioned. To the W. is a conspicuous mound, about 3 m. distant. A group of trees, rather nearer and a little N. of W. ; at this grove is said to be a village called Iftighar, 300 houses of Kurds under Namuk Agha (1910). Ruined tower and house on mound. To 1. of road small canal 6 ft. wide bringing water from Dahuk Chai. Dahuk Chai, in a shingle bed 800 yds. wide. There is always some water in the Dahuk, and in winter and spring the stream flows in several channels, the width of which varies according to the season and weather: the broadest was reported as 15 yds. wide in January 1903, and as 40 yds. wide in April 1910. The current in January 1903 was 6 m.p.h. The river is unfordable when at its highest, as after rain, but sinks rapidly. The r. bank is 20 ft. above the bed, and the 1. about 10, the r. being generally the steeper. For guns and trans port the descent to and ascent from the river-bed would need improvement. The Dahuk flows to join the c Adheim, of which it is the the largest affluent. It rises from the W. spurs of the hills SW. of Suleimaniyeh. It flows in a formidable torrent when in spate, and brings156 Miles from Baghdad 162 164 LAND EOUTES down at times such a large and rapid volume of waW that it has made for itself below Dahuk village a ) J about 1 m. in breadth. The Dahuk is the boundary between the territories of the Da'udiyeh Kurds in the SE. and the Talabaniyeh in the NE. The latter are accounted Seyyids (of the blood of the Prophet), and are turbulent and predatory Between the Dahuk Chai and Dahuk village are 'several water-channels, some of which are as much as 20 ft deep and 20 ft. wide : all are crossed by palm-tree bridges but these are not more than 4 ft. wide. ' Dahuk village. Just before entering the village there is some high ground on the 1. on which stands the minaret of an old mosque which has disappeared : the tower is a conspicuous landmark. The village contains about 200 houses. Water from the the Dahuk Chai is good and plentiful. Grazing good: fuel poor. Inhabitants were reported in 1873 to be Turkomans: in 1905 there were more Shiahs than Sunnis among them. A canal from Dahuk Chai runs through the village. The place is the seat of a Mudir with a zaptieh post. If m. NE. of Dahuk is the shrine of Zain el-Abidin, with one large and three small white domes and a few houses of Seyyids beside it. This shrine is a conspicuous landmark. From Dahuk a route, reported to be easy, leads over the low hills in a NNE. direction to Iieilan about 25 m. distant. From Leilan there is a track over the grassy plateau of the Makanjeh Dagh to Chemchemal (about 24 m. NE. of Jjeilan). Here the high-road from Kirkuk to Suleimaniyeh, which is accompanied by a T.L., is joined. See Route 37. The country between Dahuk and Chemchemal is open, but contains numerous gravelly undulations and ravines, and many small streams. Villages are few owing to Kurdish raids. For a shorter route from Dahuk to Kirkuk see m. 164| below. From Dahuk the route runs in a general direction NNW. over rolling downs, accompanied by T.L. Track easy: only slight repairs needed here and there for guns. A considerable ridge is crossed. Villages 2-3 m. to SW. of road, Tepeh (40 houses), Yangiyeh (60 houses) and Abd el-Glianim (140 houses): all inhabited by Tala- banlyeh. Dahuk lies behind, S. by E.ROUTE 25 a 157 Miles from Baghdad 1642 I65i A few water-cuts with narrow palm-tree bridges. Open cultivated plain : hills 1%m. to right. At a point some distance beyond this ridge a track branches to r. m a general N. direction to Kirkuk, which by this way is about 18 m. distant.

Matareh village (so called in Kurdish: Arabic name Ma'amareh : 50-60 houses of Arab Seyyids, see ra. 168|) this shorter route to Kirkuk crosses a small shingly stream and enters low hills. An eminence is reached, from which Matareh bears a verv little S. of SSE. Another eminence, from which Dahuk lies a very little to the S. of SSE. J In the hills to the 1., and not far off, is the village of Balaq, consisting of 50 houses of Talabaniyeh, Descent from the hills begins, and Kirkuk is seen lying about due N. J B Zandaneh village (70 houses of Arabs and Kurds) is seen to NW. of W. at l|-2 m. distance. The road emerges from the low hills. Small clear stream called Qara e Ali Chai (Khor Chai) , running in a deep ravine, is reached. The descent from the water to the S. bank is steep. There is a mill near the crossing (1910). On ascending the farther bank the village of Qara e Ali appears to the NE. Pass Qara e Ali village (100 houses of mixed tribes), about 300 yards to the r. of the road. Tarjil village (200 houses of mixed Kurds) is visible 4 m. away, ENE. To the r. Qara Hasan Hills, extending N. to E. &amp; A small water-course (dry, ApriPlOlO) is reached, and in another 2 mins. on the 1. side of the road is the Turkoman village of Tokmakli (about 60 houses). A shingly bed 70 yds. wide (Chai Tokmakli) is crossed. To the WNW. at 1-1 ^ m. are three villages called col lectively Sari Tepeh (200 houses of mixed Kurds). A covered-in well, Sabll Khaneh, on the road. Rijeibat, an Arab village of 50 houses, lies about 2 m. off ENE. Kirkuk is due N. Cultivation near road into Kirkuk.

Qara Ali, or Khor, Chai : 12 ft. wide, 2 ft. deep (January 1903), in a pebbly bed 60 yds. broad. This water course comes from the direction of Leilan (ENE. see alternative route under m. 164|), and near this point turns S. to join the 'Adheim River (6-8 m. away) at the N. end of the Hamrln 'Adheim marshes. The valley of the Qara Ali Chai above this point apparently contains a practicable route. Taza Khurmatli on the r. bank of the Qara 'Ali Chai, near a high mound about 100 ft. high. The place contains about 100 houses. Good water and camping-ground. The country round is marked by a number of tumuli. The 'Adheim River, which from the N. end of the marshy belt above mentioned is known under the name of the Hasa Su, flows in a S. direction about 1 m. W. of the village. There are some villages to the SW. of Taza Khurmatli between the Hasa Su and the Qara 'Ali Chai. From Taza Khurmatli the road runs in a general NNE. to NE. direction. Hills at first lie close to road on the r.; then after f m. through walled gardens and over water-cuts, some low hills are crossed. The country is open but rather stony. Cross the Hasa Su (almost dry in January 1908), in a bed 300 yds. wide of shingle and sand. The Hasa Su (upper course of 'Adheim River) is formed by a number of torrents in the hills NW. of Chemchemal, and runs in a great curve to the W. to Kirkuk, whence it takes a S. by W. direction till it becomes known as the 'Adheim River below its junction with the Qara 'Ali (see m. 176). At this point the river leaves the last of its defiles (2 or wmm*EOUTE 25 a 159 3 m. broad) and enters the plain. It has little or no water, except after rain or the melting of the snow. Chardakli village in plain to W. Mound on the r. bank of river, 200 ft. high, with a guardhouse on the top. Pass some cultivation and skirt the river-bed. To the r. the valley of the Hasa Su opens out into the broad valley of Leilan. The village of Leilan is 15 m. to the E. To the 1. is the low ridge of the Chardakli Dagh. Slight descent towards Kirkuk begins. The r. bank of the Hasa Su is still followed. The country is undulating, the track easy, and on both sides of the road there is cultivation. T.L. to the 1. The bed of the Hasa Su is here ^ m. to 1. When dry it may be used as an approach to Kirkuk. Kirknk. Between Kirkuk and Altun Koprii ( v 25 m. NNW.) is a range of hills of moderate height, variously marked as Jebel Gurgur or Shamaskin Dagh, which run from WNW. to ESE. The E. end of this range is known as Baba ;Grurgur. To the S. of this eastern end are a number of low ridges divided by gravelly ravines, which lie to NW., W., and S. of Kirkuk. The watershed between the Hasa Su and the Lesser Zab lies among these ridges about 10 m. from Kirkuk. On the NE. side of the Jebel Gurgur is a valley between these hills and the Shuan Dagh. At the lower end of this valley is Altun Koprtl town, and it is drained by a stream-bed called by some authorities the Mayar Dereh (see m. 208|- below), which joins the Zab about 2 m. below Altun Koprti. A traveller who crossed this stretch of country in 1909 says that there are three roads between Kirkuk and Altun Kopru. The safest, though not the shortest, was that which kept to the W. to avoid raiding parties of Hamawands, via Tepeh KOi and a ruined khan before crossing the hills. As far as can be gathered from reports and recent maps there are several possible tracks both on the S. and JST. sides of the Jebel Gurgur. Besides the pass over the hills mentioned under m. 198-|, there is apparently another pass by Shamaskin. Leaving the Korieh suburb of Kirkuk on the r. bankLAND ROUTES of the Hasa Su, the road passes the large village of Shatarli (200 houses, with leaning minaret), proceeds through cultivation for 2 m. in a WNW. direction It then crosses low stony downs. Baba Gurgur Pass. This place, which lies a little to the r. of the road, is a slight hollow in some high ground about 50 yds. by 20 yds., and there are some twenty vents of natural gas in it. These are generally alight unless artificially extinguished. If one of the vents be stopped with earth, the gas usually escapes at some other place near by, where it can be lighted with a match. There is a strong smell of sulphur in the air. A little farther on beyond the gas-vents in the same direction from Kirkuk, but quite near the road, are four to five oil-pits called Diar (wells). (These wells are marked 6^-7 miles from Kirkuk in a recent map of the road, but they have been reached in 1 hr. 10 minutes from Kirkuk, and are described as 'just beyond' Baba Gurgur). They are the property of Salih Pasha, and are said to yield eight donkey-loads (say thirty-two tins) of crude oil daily. The pits are situated on a slight hill, and are 12-15 ft. deep. The water is separated from the oil at the wells, and the oil is afterwards refined at Kirkuk. There is a sulphurous spring in the hills, a little farther on than the oil-pits. The road to Khan en-Neft, as described below, may be somewhat NE. of the main road. Another track, followed in 1903, passed the ruins of Khan Hangia over broken country by a stony track which required improvement for wheels. The Baba Gurgur sandstone hills are now entered (Qara- chok mountain, with two peaks, lying WNW.) and the top of the outer ridge followed for some distance. After 23 min. ride, Bajiwan (30 Kurdish houses) lies 1| m. SW. by S. ; Bataweh (150 houses of Turkomans) 3 m. SW. ; Qumbatlar (120 houses of Turkomans) about 4 m. SW. by W.; and Choprijeh (100 houses of Turko mans) 2-J m. W. The Jebel Makhul, on the other side of the Tigris, can be seen to SSW. at a great distance. Road continues along outermost ridge for 8 min. Eoad bears N. by W., crossing the strata diagonally and making for an inner ridge of hills.ROUTE 25 a 161 Miles from Baghdad 196 The nearer peak of Qarachok lies W. by N. from about this point. The road runs now NNW. Cross ravine containing water, and post called Khan en-Ueft. Road runs in a general N. by W. direction to the pass over the inner ridge. Cross summit of the inner ridge of the Jebel Gurgur; very steep and pebbly ascent and descent for ^ m. each side were reported in 1903. The track is 12 ft. wide. This is the watershed between the Hasa Su and the Lesser Zab. The plain of the Mayar Dereh can be over looked as far as the Lesser Zab. From the pass the following villages were observed in 1910 :—Kalwur, NE. by N., Daramau el-Aliyeh, ENE., Daraman es-Sifleh, E. by N. The road descends to the plain in a general NNW. direction. There appear to be a number of alternative tracks from the pass to Altun Koprii. In the latest map made of the route (1912) the main road is shown as running through Ki Bibaneh and GokTepeh, and crossing the Mayar Dereh about 2^ m. from Altun Koprli. It does not exactly coincide with either of the routes described below. From the further side of Jebel Gurgur a track leads NNE. to Eoi Sanjag, crossing Lesser Zab by a ford (impassible in winter) at foot of range bounding the Shuan country on W., and continuing over easy foothills, below which water is found, to a pass from which Koi Sanjag is visible. Route (i) The following account is taken from a report of 1910:— Descend from pass to plain. In 40 min. Kalwur lies due N. Kalwur village, ^ m. to r. From this point Bibaueh Znghair (15 houses) is 1 m. N. by E. Bibaneh Zardak (20 houses) is about 3 m. NE. by N. Blbaneh Eebir (60 houses) is about 4 m. NE. by E. The road runs NW. by K T.L. now on 1.

There are said to be about 30 villam of this tribe in all. The road crosses a small clear stream in a shingly bed called by the Turks Injesui and by the Kurds Galal (so reported in 1910. This may be the stream marked on maps as Mayar Dereh). Eoad crosses two small canals spanned by small bridges. Kitkeh village about 2 m. to SW. Broad depression followed by a stony ascent. Koad crosses a small dry shingly ravine called Qara Chai in Turkish and Wlshkakhan in Kurdish. From this point the whole way to Altun Kopru is down hill. Altxui Koprti town. Route (ii) The following account of another track is taken from a report of 1903 :— Foot of the hills. Open cultivated plain extending about 10 m. in all directions and up to Altun Koprii. Five or six small villages in the plain to the r. The road turns to the 1. from the foot of the pass and runs parallel to the hills at a distance of about 2 m. Track level and good, through cultivation. Small stream of good water to r. Small copse. Pass small village on 1. ^m. off. Several villages to r. 2-3 m. off. Kares with good drinking water on either side of the road. Copse on r. T.L. parallel to the road on the 1. (?). Mound 100 ft. high to r.

The Baghdad—Mosul road leaves Altun Kopru in a NNW. direction up the valley of the Injesui, a tributary of the Lesser Zab. This valley contains corn-land, and is enclosed on either side by low hills, which form a semicircle to the front. Those 1. of the road rise about 500 ft. above the road ; those to r. are lower. Pass a copse (1903) on 1. of road. General character of country to Qush Tepeh is open, fairly well cultivated, undulating to hilly. Road is stony but easy. Apparently in this neighbourhood the line of the semi circle of hills which close in on the river is reached. Direct Mosul road avoiding Erbil turns 1. (So Report on Route, 1910: W.O. Map, following a description of 1873, marks this route as diverging about 4 m. farther on.) It is described as an easy route through fairly well-populated country: water from wells and streams. For Zab ferry at Quweir see p. 69. The track to Makhmur and Qal'ah Sherghat (see 27) is marked on map as diverging to the 1. about 1J m. farther on : but further information on this point should be obtained. In this neighbourhood a bend of the Injesui is apparently crossed (28 mins. ride from Altun Koprii): another bend is crossed 4 mins. later, and a third touched 3 mins. after the second. * In April 1910 there were only a few inches of water in the stream. Apparently there is an alternative track over the downs to r. not far from the river: it crosses the bed of the Iliujak Chai, a tributary of the Injesui (20 ft. wide, 1 ft. deep in February 1903). Direct Mosul road about ^ m. 1. (?). Near it is the hamlet of Makhsumeh. (12 Kurdish houses). Between the two roads is a mill. Open undulating country. T.L.

The most important are Qush Tepeh village (100 houses, 11 m. W. by S.), Girdamala (60 houses, 1 m. to E.), and Mirghuzar (70 houses, 5 m. WNW.). At Qush Tepeh good and plentiful water can be obtained from two kures. Other villages and black- tent settlements in the distance. At a village about 10 m.

In this neighbourhood small village on 1. of road followed by authority of 1903. It has square mud-walled enclosure 50 yds. square and 12 ft. high. m. farther small village to r. with similar enclosure. Cross a hares (25 ft. deep, 20 ft. wide, with 1 ft. of water) by a brick bridge (1903). Route now runs over broken ground. Erbil. The post-road between Erbil and Mosul runs through a rolling plain, the undulations of which sometimes rise to the height of downs. The country is treeless, and in parts stony, but well cultivated. More especially, the plain beyond the Zab contains numerous villages. The Great Zab (see under m. 262^) is a serious obstacle at any season, but especially in the spring floods. The Ghazir Su (see under m. 269|) would not be fordable in spring. From Erbil the road runs somewhat W. of NW. to the neighbourhood of— Girdashir (30 huts of Kurds). Good water from wells 25 ft. deep, drawn by rope and bucket. Thence the track runs generally WSW. over an open plain with some cultivation, but few villages in sight for 8^ m. to the Great Zab. Some stony ravines draining towards that river are crossed. The Great Zab, Eski Kelek (called now Hasan Agha) ferry. The channel in October 1903 was 150 yds. wide, with a fairly strong current and some 10 ft. deep at the ferry. It is not usually fordable, though it is sufficiently low to ford late in some years. The whole stream-bed (| m. wide) is covered at the flood season. There are two ferry-boats to hold six laden animals, but usually loads166 LAND ROUTES Miles from Baghdad 263| 269i are taken off and put in the boats and the animals swim There are 15 houses (inhabited by Kurds who have to work the ferry) and a khan on the 1, bank. The r. bank is open shingle, but the 1. is rather steep, with gravelly cliffs in places. A short way down-stream the 1. bank is easier. Girdaresh village is 4 m. up-stream on the 1. bank and Baishir 3 m. up on the r. bank. (On the Great Zab see Tigris, Boute III E, at m. 150^.) An alternative track to the Zab leaves Erbil in a W. by N. direction and crosses the Demir Dagh downs, while the post-road skirts their northern side. (Details from report of 1903.) This other way, after | m., crosses a nullah, the banks of which afford complete cover from the Erbil citadel. It runs NE. by SW. The country is undulating and cultivated. At fl m. two small enclosures are passed to the 1., the first 15 yds, square with a wall 12 ft. high, and the other 50 yds. square with a wall 12 ft. high. Both have mud walls and watch-towers. Then a small stream is crossed 10 ft. wide and 1 ft. deep. At f4 m. a small village lies | m. to the 1., with mud-walled enclosure 50 yds. square. At m. the route begins to ascend over ground undu lating to hilly. At t7 m. the top of the downs is reached, and at fS m. their watershed is followed over ground full of holes. The T.L. (two wires) crosses the road in this neighbourhood. At flG m. a village 1 m. to 1. is passed. The road is stony over undu lating country. At flS m. another small village lies to r. of road, with a small well containing good water: thence over undu lating country gradually descending to river. At t20| m. the final descent to the river leads down by a steep and stony track winding along a pebbly ravine bed. A little farther on emerge on cultivated plain. At ^22 m. the Zab is reached. The river bed is here 800 yds. wide, of pebble and sand, but in flood ex tends to 1 m. in width. In February 1903 the stream was about 150 yds. wide with a current of about 4 m. an hour. Ferry-boat was punt-shaped, and lightly built, 20 ft. long and 8 ft. wide. There is a village on each bank. That on the 1. is 1\ m. distant with 50 mud houses, and a walled enclosure on a mound which commands the road as it descends from the high ground to the river plain. The road leaves the river and ascends some low gravelly undulations. Tamarisk shrubs and a few trees in the river-flat. Manguvar village on the 1. bank of the Ghazir Bu, which in October 1903 was 60 yds. wide and 2 ft. deep. The bed is 300 yds. wide, and consists of shingle and sand. In spring there are freshets from 8 ft. deep with a great rush of water. It has then to be crossed by raft. InKOUTES 25 a, b 167 Miles from Bagflxdad 274i 278i 290i 292i winter and spring, even when the river is fordable, its depth and current make the passage difficult. There are some small villages down-stream. Continue over open plain of good soil well cultivated. The road passes close to the S. extremity of the hilly- country of the Maqlub and Zardak ranges. Pass Targulla, 1^ m. to the N. of road. It lies at the S. extremity of the Zardak Hills (or Jebel 'Ain es-Safra). Large spring in these hills. Keremlis. Christian village of 120 well-built stone houses near a mound. The main road passes close to it, but there are several parallel tracks all equally good. Water from stream and from wells. A few vegetable gardens and an olive-grove. Birtulla is another large Christian village, 4 m. to the NW. One track goes through it. There is a track running along the 1, side of a stream-bed which leads S. by W. to ITimrud (tl9 m., see Tigris, III E, m. ISOJ). From Nimrnd there is a track along the 1. bank of the Tigris to Mosul (f22 m. from Nimrud). From Keremlis the post-road runs across the open plain to Mosul, which lies W. by N. of Keremlis. Euin-mounds of Nineveh (Qoyuujiq and Nebi Yunus). Mosul. ROUTE 25 b BAGHDAD— MOSUL (230 m.) Via Right Bank of the Tigris Authorities •.—-Military Report on E. T. A., vol. iii, 1904 (route report of Feb. 1908) ; a report of a journey in autumn 1903 ; and other sources of information. Baghdad—Samarra.—Before the present war there was a route passable for wheels as far as Samarra. This was followed by the large pilgrim-waggons which plied between Samarra and Baghdad. The road appears to afford good going in dry weather, but is likely to be very heavy after rain, and in the neighbourhood of Baghdad the country traversed is more or less flooded in spring. Numerous^ water- channels are crossed. The palm-tree bridges described in the itinerary below as occurring near Baghdad do not appear to be suitable for heavy wheeled traffic, and it appears that the pilgrim waggons did not follow exactly the course here detailed. At many places there fe.168 LAND BOUTES are several possible tracks for pack-animals. Near Baghdad the tops of the canal-banks and riverside dykes niay sometimes be used in order to avoid flood or marshy ground. For railway see Appendix Water appears to be plentiful, from canals, wells, or the Tigris There is a fair amount of cultivation and at least two flourishing villages (Sumeikeh, m. 39, and Beled, m. 51) are passed: a certain amount of supplies for small bodies of men could therefore perhaps be obtained. As regards grazing, there is some camel-thorn, and ' apparently some grass here and there in spring. Fuel probablv scarce. Samarra—Mosul. —Beyond Samarra the character of the route changes. Before the present war it was just passable for wheels (though with difficulty) throughout. Light carts had occasionally traversed it, and a few years ago a motor-car was brought by this route from Baghdad to Mosul, but it broke down on the return journey. For most of the way there would be no serious difficulties in road-making. The track passes sometimes along the floor of the Tigris Valley (for description, see III E) over stony ground or alluvial soil, crossing fairly numerous wadis : sometimes it leaves the river-trough and ascends the low plateau or hills bordering the valley : here it generally runs through open rolling country, but in places has to traverse broken ground (as near Tekrit: see m. 100|). At one point (see m. 134) it makes a long detour from the river, about 84 m. in length, where the r. bank becomes impassable owing to the Hamrln Hills. These hills though low are very rugged and broken, and the river flows close under their NW. side from Qal'ah Sherghat to the Fet-hah gorge by which it breaks through them. The track by which the route eventually crosses the hills to rejoin the river near Qal'ah Sherghat would need in places considerable improvement before it could be made easy for wheels (see m. 157). The authority whose report is here chiefly followed made the journey on horseback in 1903. Between Samarra and Mosul water can generally be obtained from the river, but on the detour of 34 m. already mentioned drinkable water is very scarce. Between Samarra and the cultivated area near Mosul, patches of rather poor cultivation occur at intervals along the Tigris Valley, but there are few permanent villages and those are usually small. In peace time camps of Shammar and other nomads were occasionally to be found near the river. Unless the flocks and herds of the Jezlreh nomads could be drawn upon, no amount of local supplies worth considering could be found on the r. bank of the Tigris, except for a limited quantity at Tekrit. There is much good grass grazing in spring in places between Qal'ah Sherghat and Mosul (see note under m. 168, m. 173, m. 206, m. 210 below):ROUTE 25 b 169 between Samarra and Qal'ah Sherghat spring-grazing for horses is much more scarce. In Feb.-March 1878 there was some wild barley and rye in places near the river, and good grass pasture was reported in the valley a few hours N. of Tekrit. Grass is found in April in the Jebel Hamrln, where the track crosses the hills. Grazing for camels apparently fair near the river. Fuel is apparently scarce throughout: \amarisk is found in places near the river. Note on left hank. The route along the r. bank is followed by travellers, as fewer obstacles are to be met with on that side of the river than on the 1. bank. It is possible on the 1. bank to follow the Baghdad—Salahiyeh road (see B25 a, ii) as far as the neigh bourhood of Khan Nahrawan, whence a track apparently leads to Samarra. But the 'Adheim River (see III D, m. 59-|) would be a serious obstacle in spring and the distance from Baghdad to Samarra by the 1. bank would be considerably longer. Supplies as far as Khan Nahrawan would probably be more plentiful than on the r. bank. For the Nahrawan canal, see p. 38. Above Samarra the 1. bank track as far as Tekrit (and probably as far as the Hamrin Hills) seems to be much the same in character as that on the r. bank. The only details available as to the crossing of the Hamrln range near the E. bank of the river are given in 26. Above the Hamrln the Lesser and Great Zabs would be difficult obstacles especially in the flood season. Local means of crossing are merely a few ferry-boats or Jcelelc Material for raft or bridge- building is lacking in the neighbourhood of the mouths of these rivers. In the immediate neighbourhood of the 1. bank above Samarra local supplies would seem to be as scanty as on the r. bank of the Tigris: but on the plain E. of the Tigris between the Zabs the district of Erbil produces enough corn to export in normal times to Baghdad, and the plain between Erbil and Mosul is fairly populous and well-cultivated. For a general description of the country between Baghdad and Samarra on the r. bank of the Tigris see Tigris, Introduction to Route III E. Fords across the Tigris, passable in the 1. w. season, are mentioned on p. 19 and p. 40. Miles from Baghdad 0 Baghdad.

From here the possible tracks strike across an open cultivated plain, liable to inundation in the spring floods. In Feb. 1903 the water-cuts in this region were easy to pass. The best track for wheels is said to keep about 3 m. from the river in order to avoid water-cuts and marshy ground. For the track which diverges to the 1. beyond Kazimain and leads NW, across the desert to Anah, see 48. A possible track follows the top of a raised dyke along the river, leading to two water-cuts a m. farther on, which have to be crossed. One had no bridge in 1903, and its ford would require improving for guns. The other had only a palm-tree bridge 3 ft. wide. Cross two small canals, with palm-tree bridges 6 ft. high. Eoad follows top of canal bank 20-30 ft. high. Keeping in a general direction between N. and N. by W., it now leaves the neighbourhood of the river, which bends to the E. near Haseiweh. A track apparently branches off in a NNE. direction to the Babi tract on the^ r. bank of the Tigris, whence it runs N. to the Qal'at Tarmiyeh police post. Beyond Qal'at Tarimyeh a track seems to follow the course of the river. (Thus on the right bank opposite Sindiyeh about 9 m. NNE. of Qal'at Tarmiyeh is a grove of poplar described as a halting-place for caravans from Baghdad.) A line of ruin-mounds is passed. Well with good water 20 ft. below the surface. A canal with bank 10 ft. high is skirted. Khan Meshahidiyeh. Railway station. A brick khan 100 yds. by 90 yds., with walls 18 ft. high, crenellated on top. There is a semicircular bastion at each corner, and a small square one in the middle of the curtain. Close to the khan is a two-storied zpost, with stabling for six horses and a courtyard 16 yds. by 12 yds. There is a well, perennial but brackish, water being 35 ft. below the surface. Water can also be obtained in skins from the river, about 4 m. to the E. (opposite Reshldiyeh on the 1. bank). The country round the khan is desert. Ground low: boggy in winter. Beyond this cultivation begins again. Khor Tarmiyeh. : swamp about 1 m. to E, Euin -heaps and old canal beds henceforward frequent.

R. bank of the Tigris, at Mansuriyeh ferry and near mouth of Tarmiyeh canal, lies about 6^ m. to E. Ruin heaps to left. On W. side of railway-line, which apparently runs to left of the track, are small irrigation-cuts belonging to the Dujeil system (see Route III D, m. 81i), some of which may still carry a little water in the h. w. season. W. of these (? about 2 m. WNW. of this point on the route) is the tomb of Sheikh Ibrahim. Ruins of 'Akbareh. about 1 m. to E., on the old bed of the Tigris, which above 'Akbareh makes a detour to E. From here to Sumeikeh the route takes a general NNW. direction. Several dry canal beds are crossed. The soil here is sandy clay. Two small canals with water in them in Feb. 1903. They are about 15 ft. between the banks and 10 ft. deep ; the water was 4 ft. wide and 2 ft. deep. Old bed of the Tigris about 1 m. to r. Sumeikeh.

The village and neighbouring lands are the property ofthe Ba'irafys-Samyeh Supplies fairly plentiful. Water good and abundant; wells and canal. Sumeikeh lies about 9 m. W. by N. of a point on the r. bank of the Tigris opposite Sa'diyeh. The old bed of the Tigris runs about 1 m. NW. of the village, outside the date- groves. From Sumeikeh the road takes a general NW. direction. The railway apparently lies to right. The road runs parallel to the course of the Dujeil (l-i m. to r.) and the old Tigris bed (2^-1 m. to r.). Between the old and present beds of the Tigris a space about 12-8 m. wide is dotted with ruin-mounds and ruin-fields. The country-side is fairly well cultivated. Khazraj Arabs in this neighbourhood. In the next 8 m. several canals are crossed, varying in width from 10 to 40 ft. and in depth from 5 ft. to 20 ft. below the level of the plain. Some of them contained water in Feb. 1903. Almost all were traversed by palm- tree bridges about 10 ft. wide.172 LAND ROUTES Miles from Baglidad 47 49 51 52 55 57 62 64 66 Route runs along bank of small water-channel, 10 ft. wide by 5 ft. deep: the water in it was 3 ft. wide and 2 ft deep in Feb. 1903.

There are fords in the low-water season across the Tigris at Darawlsh Island and Baheirdeh Island, in the neighbourhood of Beled (4 and 3 m. from the village respectively). These fords have pebbly bottoms. The soil is sandy clay : the track is good except after rain. Harbeh Canal, from Tigris, consisting of three channels each about 15 ft. wide, 10 ft. deep, the banks 15 ft. high! Only one channel had water in it in Feb. 1903. The canal is crossed by a brick bridge (Jisr Harbeh) of solid construction. In 1903 it was reported to have four arches, and to be 60 yds. long, carrying a roadway 27 ft. wide Beyond the Harbeh bridge is an open plain much inter sected by dry canal beds, with pebbly waste and acacia scrub. In this neighbourhood apparently T.L. leaves route, and runs NNW. to cross the river near El-Hawiyeh ferry, whence it goes NW. to Samarra. Peshatiyeh canal (45 ft. wide, banks 25 ft. above bed). Water in Feb. 1903 6 ft. wide, 3 ft. deep, crossed by a brick bridge about 10 ft. wide. For about 4 m. the country is covered with old and dry canal beds, with banks varying from 5 to 40 ft. in height. Some of them are crossed by the route. Dry canal reported to r., 30 ft. deep and 60 ft. wide ; sides very steep. Mouth of Dujeil Canal, a short distance to r. Henceforward up to Samarra boat-bridge the route runs close to the river: the railway is apparently close to it on the 1., and near the railway seems to be the bed of the dry Ishaki Canal.

The track now skirts some low hills to the W., and is broken in places. Sheriyet el-Hamzeli, camp-ground, with good water from an arm of the Tigris, 30 ft. wide, 5 ft. deep. The track now lies through continuous cultivation. At 3 m. it touches the river, which is here about 150 yds. wide. The hills are here about ^ m. to the W., rising to 70 ft. above the plain. The track is easy, occasionally touching the river bank. The track skirts the river, which is here about j m. wide, | m. from the hills to the W. At some point in this neighbourhood is the ravine, reported by a German traveller in 1893, which marks the boundary between the Vilayets of Baghdad and Mosul. The hills are 1 m. to the W., with cliffs 70 to 100 ft. high, and after some distance give way to sandy mounds. Qal'at Mekrun, ruins on a projecting bluff. This is perhaps identical with Khan el-Kharnineh, Turkish barracks on the site of the ruins of a thirteenth-century building. The track here runs N. by W., skirting low sandhills, 50 ft. high, on the W., over a sandy, ellipse-shaped plain, 7 m. long and 1^ m. broad. Sher eimiyeh, guard-house and camp-ground.

A few pools of very salt and quite undrinkable water. The route from here to the point where it rejoins the river at Qal'ah Sherghat is lacking in good water. The country is desert. There is here no settled population, but occasional encampments of Dilaim may be seen. In autumn 1903 water reported 5 ft. below surface. Arabs camped here in spring. In autumn 1903 water was reported 4 ft, below surface. In autumn 1903, it is reported, water-holes were found in a nullah about 14 m. from Shereimiyeh at a locality called Mnseltain. The water was 3 ft. below surface, and was estimated to be sufficient for 5,000 camels a day. It may be brackish. Track approaches Jebel Hamrln creek, rather difficult for wheels. Eilalij, spring at foot of the Jebel Hamrln. The water is scanty and brackish. This is perhaps the spring reported by another traveller as being bitter with sulphur and pitch. The quantity of water has been estimated at 50 gall. p.h. The hills are here intersected with many nullahs, up and down which the track winds. The ascent to the crest of the range, which is here about 200 ft. high and 1 m. wide, is easy. The track keeps along the crests of the spurs. The track crosses a valley (? the Wadi Jahannam) at right angles, and gradually ascends the Jebel Khanuqah by a sandy track. Jebel Khanuqah, summit of the range. The track is difficult for wheels, and winds over occasional outcrops of marble among low hills. From the summit it descends, winding in and out of ravines. 'Ain Shababik.

The country between Qal'ah Sherghat and the Tartar is open and undulating, traversed by a number of deep wadis which have water in spring. There is much rich pasture in this region in April. The Wadi Tartar near El -Hadr (see below) is 25-30 ft. wide, and in spring is 5-7 ft. deep. The banks are rotten. There are few places where camels can cross. About T 31 m. WNW. of Qal'ah Sherghat are the ruins of Hatra (el- Hadhr), situated about 2^ m. W. of the Wadi Tartar. These ruins include the remains of a palace with seven vaulted halls, some of the walls of which are still standing to a great height built of squared blocks of stone. Protection was afforded by a wall over 3 m. in circumference and strengthened at intervals with towers and by a wide, deep moat. Considerable portions of the wall are still standing. At the SE. corner, inside the wall, is a sulphur spring, and a little to the NE. of this spring, outside the wall, a pool of rather brackish water. There is said, however, to be a good spring of freshwater just outside the walls, though no other indication is given as to its position. The period of the greatest prosperity of Hatra fell in the first and second centuries a.d ., under the Parthian Empire. It was destroyed by the Persian king Sapor I ( a.d . 242-72). The mileage up to Shura (see m. 204) is very uncertain; the authority from which these distances are taken gives 7 hrs. as the time between Qal'ah Sherghat and Shura, but this appears to be an error. Another authority estimates the distance between Qal'ah Sherghat and Shura as 42 miles and gives the time taken from Kaiyara to Qal'ah Sherghat at 8-| hrs. Creek, 20 ft. wide, 5 ft. deep. The track now enters the open desert again, the hills trending to the W. The track skirts the hills, with the river 1 m. E. The track enters a small alluvial plain called Sherghat, partly cultivated. The road is good and sandy, skirting the hills, which are here about 100 ft. high. The track touches the river, which here has banks 20 ft. above the water. In 1903 there were sheep grazing on the plain and nomad Arabs in the valley. The road is good, lying up the bed of a stream over a low line of hills. Summit of the hills. Stony downs to r. and 1.

The water is clear, but brackish, and not fit for drinking. The road enters a large open valley along the Tigris. Small nullah, dry and easy. The track skirts a creek with steep banks. The water is clear, but slightly brackish. A nullah on the W. skirts the road. Shura village. There is drinking water here, slightly brackish. In 1903 there were 20 saptiehs belonging to the Sultan's farm and acting as desert-guards, housed in ^ a khan 60 by 40 yds. The place has a Mudir. The distances N. of Shura are again uncertain: the M178 LAND EOUTES Miles from Baghdad authority from which they are taken gives the time between Shura and Hammam 'Ali (see m. 217|) as 7 hrs. Another authority supports the distance given below making it 13 m. between Shura and Hamniam Ali. A nullah on the W. 30 ft. deep, but easily crossed at various points, skirts the track.

Outside the village are the remains of an ancient town, each side measuring about 420 yds., surrounded by a square of mound walls as at Nineveh. In the centre is a large mound. Makhmur itself is a new place, being the centre of a large estate of the Da'irat which comprises most of the country between the two Zabs in the neighbourhood of the Qarachok Dagh. Makhmur isKOUTE 27 181 connected by telegraph with Erbil. There are here a large khan, a bazaar, and a (government building) erected by the Da/irat es-Scn The town in 1903 was flourishing, a good many caravans passing through the place. Some Turkish troops under a captain were stationed here. In 1903^Agha Ibrahlm 7 the chief of the Disdlyeh Kurds, resided at Makhmur. He exercised civil jurisdiction over his tribe, who are semi-nomads (1,200 families) having their head-quarters in the Qara- chok Dagh. In 1903 they were armed with Martinis manufactured at Suleimaaiyeh. From Makhmur the track ascends the saddle leading across the Qarachok Dagh. This pass is called Hasan G -hazi, after a Kurdish saint, whose tomb is here. The shrine is much reverenced by the Disdlyeh, and is a place of refuge for outlaws and persons pursued by a blood-feud. At some points the pass is difficult for wheels, but it might easily be improved. Summit of the Hasan Ghazi Pass. At the eastern foot of the pass, the track bears ESE., running over an open plain parallel with the southern part of the Qarachok Dagh. It is quite easy in fine weather.

Via K hanikin Authorities :—Routes in Persia, vol. iii, 96 (1910) ; Corrections to vol, in 1914 • Koute Report of 1909. ' ' This is the main caravan and trade route between Mesopotamia and Persia. It is passable for wheels in dry weather, but in wet weather, unless the season is exceptionally mild, the road becomes very heavy and in places a quagmire. In the years immediately preceding the war there was a motor-car service between Baghdad and Baqubeh. The complete journey is performed in 20 days by camels, and in 14 days by horses and mules. Mules, ponies, and donkeys are the usual transport animals, camels being used only in the summer and not after the rains have set in. As far as Khanikin, on the Persian border, the road lies over rich alluvial soil which in many places is subject to inundation. After 1 in. of rain the whole country becomes so boggy as to be almost impassable. From November to April the road is impassable for camels owing to the rain and snow. A Persian company was formed in 1905 to put and keep the road in repair. A few years before the war it was reported to be in fairly good order and quite passable for wheeled traffic, though very rough in places, especially bey ond Khanikin. The range of low hills over which the road passes to Khanikin would offer no obstacle to the construction of a railway. In January and February the cold is considerable and water often freezes. During July, August, and September the heat is intense during the day, but very hot nights are unusual at any time, and in June there is generally a refreshing north breeze. The annual rain fall is about 7 in. and falls in the cold weather. Between Baghdad and Khanikin the rainy season may be said to commence about November and to end in March. Beyond Khanikin the rain starts somewhat earlier, and ends later. Snow falls in the region between Ser-i-Pul and Kirmanshah.ROUTES 27, 28 a I8 3 Supplies of all kinds would be available in large quantities, especially after the harvest, as the surrounding country is very rich and well cultivated in the Baghdad districts. In the Persian districts there is not such a large amount of cultivation, but still the country traversed is fairly rich. The grazing varies much from year to year, there being seldom much except in the spring. Mules, donkeys, and horses using this route are fed on barley and straw, which are always procurable. In the spring camels graze on what they can find vvi voute* At other seasons they are fed on barley-flour made into cakes, and straw. Until Persian territory is reached, fuel is very scarce ; there it can be obtained in any quantities from the mountains. Water is good ancf plentiful throughout the route, generally being obtained from streams or canals. At Baghdad about 1,000 camels could be collected in a fortnight; other animals ordinarily about 100 daily. Beyond Khanikin no animals are obtainable until Kirmanshah is reached. Most 01 the mules and ponies used in this route come from Persia, time were given very large numbers could be collected, as large caravans are continually passing along this route. As far as Qasi- i-Shlrln (m. 112)^ there are practically no obstacles, except for the heavy state of the road after rain and the numerous irrigation channels which have to be crossed. The boat-bridge over the Diyaleh Kiver (m. 30^) might require to be improved. ^ When last reported on (1907) it was only fit for the passage of light vehicles, unhorsed and man-handled across, and was unfit for the passage of guns or heavy vehicles. The river is fordable in the 1. w. season. The pass over the Jebel Hamrln (beginning m. 64) is iiarrow but passable for carts drawn by 4 horses abreast. At the Taq-i-Garra Pass (m. 143) guns would have to be double-horsed in certain places. In the stretch from Karind (m. 164-1) to Khorasabad (m. ^75^) the fiist 3 m. are stony and exceedingly rough, and the remainder of that stretch along the valley is heavy and swampy after rain, and passes over frequent streams. The Nal Shikan Pass (m. 190^) would have to be improved to render it fit for the passage of guns. T.L. accompanies the route on left hand. . c _ / * .

To this point the road is good and pass able to all arms in dry weather. Some of the canals would require ramping, and some of them are crossed by rickety bridges. In wet weather the worst part of the road is the last mile. Between Baqubeh and the frontier (100 m.) the road used to be dangerous owing to the depredations of the Shammar Arabs and Hamawand Kurds, and more recent accounts (e. g. 1909) suggest that this was still the case in the years immediately preceding the present war. The road emerges from the northern entrance of Eaqubeh through the walled gardens, bearing easterly, and winds through hillocky ground over numerous irrigation chan nels, and would be deep and bad in wet weather.

The track generally has been described as a carriage- road, but a very bad one, both over the hills where it is very stony and the gradients are apparently steep, and over the plain where it is very soft. For the first m. from Shahraban the road is heavy in wet weather and impracticable for wheels. Numerous culverts and small bridges are required.

The road crosses by an ancient brick bridge with roadway of 12 ft. between the parapets. Some ruined houses near by. From here the road traverses undulating gravelly country crossed by broad, shallow ravines. Rising gently, the road enters the Jebel Hamriu range (low barren hills) by a narrow pass. See also under m. 69 below. On the ordinary track the path here, only wide enough for single animals, is a deeply worn gut in the smooth rock. After about a hundred yards the gut widens and the road spreads into several deep worn paths divided by ridges of smooth rock. Gradual ascent for 2 m., road widening and traversing some plateaux. Summit of pass, 400 ft. above the plain. Apparently at the summit the pass is narrow but passable for carts drawn by four horses abreast. The descent is gentle by a broad track over stone and gravel. The road emerges from the hills and descends a gravel slope. There is said to be a comparatively easy cart-track over the Jebel Hamrln range by which guns could pass; it enters the hills about 1 m. to the S. of the ordinary track, winds about till it joins after reaching the summit.

There was very little traffic on this route before the war. It was used by the people of Mandali to carry produce to Kirmanshah, but not by people from Baghdad. As far as Beledruz (also spelt Baladoz) it has been in use as a route for carts carrying heavy machinery, &amp;c., for the D'Arcy Oil Company. (For another road to Beledruz see Route 30.) The remainder of the route in its present condition is only a mule track. It is a difficult route for camel transport. As far as Mandali the route lies over alluvial plains which after rain become more or less inundated and impassable owing to the boggy nature of the soil. Even a little rain, by making the road slippery and sticky, may produce a serious obstacle. After heavy rain some 24 hours at least are required to allow the road to dry sufficiently to permit of the passage of caravans. The latter part of the route lies through mountainous and rocky country, and the going is bad until the main Baghdad—Kirmanshah route is reached at Khor- asabad (see m. 170|). To render the route fit throughout for the passage of carts a large amount of labour would have to be expended on a great number of points. Till Khorasabad there would be practically no supplies along the route with the exception of the stretch from about 16 m. before Beledruz and the stretch between Beledruz and Mandali. A certain amount of live stock, however, might be purchased from nomads. After the rains in the spring there would probably be an abundant supply of grass and grazing for animals, but later in the summer it would be extremely scarce. Fuel would be scarce or practically non-existing until the Persian border was crossed, after which there would be a certain amount of small shrubs and bushes, becoming more plentiful in the later stages. The water for the first 73 m. is rather brackish, more particularly in the summer months. In Kirmanshah road goes in a general ENE. direction. It is throughout good and passable for all arms. Kirmanshah. (see Gazetteer o/ vol. ii). Supplies abundant. Water and forage plentiful. Fuel from the mountains. EOUTE 28 bKOUTES 28 a, b 195 % the latter part of the route the water appears to be good and fairly abundant from streams. Along the road itself there would be practically no transport animals obtainable, as the districts passed through are almost without inhabitants except for some nomad tribes. Miles from Baghdad 0 Baghdad. The general direction of the route is NE. The country through which it runs is flat but inter spersed with mounds which are seldom more than 15 ft. above the surrounding country and have gently sloping sides. They form no real obstacle to the movement of men, horses, or even carts, but they afford cover to view or fire to a considerable distance in rear of them. For the first 8 m. the track is passable for carts in dry Aveather, but even a little rain is a serious obstacle, and after a heavy fall it would be impassable for at least 24 hours after the ground began to dry. An inch of rain makes the country difficult even for men on foot. 3| The first group of mounds mentioned above. 7 Silted-up remains of old canals running generally N. by W. to S. by E. There are two or three such embankments varying in height from 15 ft. to 5 ft., and in breadth from 40 ft. to 10 ft. 8 The soil, which up to this point has been a light clay, now becomes more sandy. 13 Boat ferry at the Diyaleh. The river here has steep banks even at the ferry, and they are in many places precipitous. It is about 60 yds. wide. The depth varies considerably according to the season, say from about 15 ft. to 2 ft. The current of the river varies according to the season from 4 m.p.h. after a rise to an almost imperceptible flow during the dry season. The ferry a few years before the war consisted of a light boat of rectangular or punt shape, about 30 ft. long by 10 ft. wide, one end of which was open and nearly flush with the bank ; at this end embarkation and disembarkation took place. A slack hemp rope was stretched from bank to bank and moored to wooden pegs let into the banks. Along this rope the ferry-boat was hauled by men in the boat; two men sufficed for this unless the wind was unusually strong and directly up and down stream, when more labour would be required. The boat could carry eight horses at a time, n 2196 LAND ROUTES Miles from Baghdad u and a proportionate number of mules or other animals. The sides of the boat were only about 8 ft. above the water, and if the animals were restive there was some danger of their jumping out of the boat or putting their feet through the sides, which were lightly built of laths laced between timbers about 4 to 6 inches in diameter which formed the ribs of the boat. The outside of the boat was covered with a kind of pitch or bitumen apparently a sufficient protection against leakage. The boat was furnished with a long rudder built out on a framework of light timber. The rudder made a powerful lever, and the boat was proportionately handy. Despite the steepness of the banks, it is not necessary to unload animals laden with ordinary weights. On the far, or 1, bank there are at a distance of 50 ft. the remains of an old canal—the Nahrawan Canal. It is silted up but is about 20 ft. wide and about 10 ft. high. Abu 'Aruj, a little N. General direction of route NE. The country E. of the Diyaleh is said to be much greener than that on the Baghdad side. There is sporadic cultivation in some hollows where rain-water has collected, but it is not annual. There are one or two encampments of wander ing Arabs who halt at places where there is water until it is finished. The country is featureless and flat, with a few mounds at intervals. During the h. w. season this portion of the desert is dotted with shallow lakes, and it is not possible to move in a straight line in any direction for more than 3 or 4 m. at a stretch. These lakes are merely collections of rain-water in depres sions of the ground, and do not generally exceed 3 ft. in depth. There are no reeds or grass in these lakes and no cover of any kind on or near them. During winter grass is abundant but very short, and in the hot season the water and grass disappear, and the place becomes a burn ing desert of dust. A portion (not located) of the land along this route belongs to the es-Saniyeh and is fertile. As one approaches Beledruz the land becomes lower and marshy. During or soon after rain this part of the country must be quite impassable. At 2 or 3 m. from Beledruz a few irrigation channels are met with, but they are not a serious obstacle even to carts.ROUTE 28 b 197 The main canal from the K, however, known as the Beledruz Canal, is about 8 ft. deep and about 20 ft. wide, and when full is a complete obstacle to all progress except at the few places where it is bridged. There are only- three such places in the neighbourhood of Beledruz, and when they were last reported on one bridge only consisted of two palm-trees thrown across with some dust and mud spread over them. The other bridges are one of brick and one of wood in the village of Beledruz itself. The brick bridge is about 10 ft. wide and strong enough for field artillery or ordinary carts. It leads into the farm-yard of a farm which belonged some years ago to a Constantinople Greek named Zarifi. From the farm-yard there is an exit to r. and 1. on the opposite side of the bridge. The farm-houses and buildings are of brick and consist of four courtyards leading by narrow passages one into another. Beledruz (Baladoz). The place is thickly wooded and con sists largely of date gardens and orchards. All these gardens and orchards are enclosed by walls, about a foot and a half thick and about 10 ft. high. Each enclosure has one or two narrow doors. The bazaar consists of one street and is insignificant. The lanes between the gardens are about 12 ft. wide and very filthy; they are nearly all on a rectangular plan. The wooden bridge over the canal in the centre of the village has been described as a frail structure of wood fit for loaded mules and perhaps camels, but hardly for anything heavier. It was about 4 ft. wide and was sup ported in the centre by a brick column. Water plentiful and good. There are no trees or bushes between Baghdad and Mandali except at Beledruz, and the country round, with the exception of a few mounds and canal-banks, is perfectly flat. At Beledruz JRoute 30 joins the present route. The general direction is now E. by N. Leaving the gardens, the route starts over a broad clay track through grassy fields skirting an irrigation-cut. For 2 m. the only road leads through a reedy marsh with from 18 in. to 2 ft. of water ; the bottom is fairly firm, but in places there are deep muddy cuts into which the animals sink. The track is cleared of reeds, and there is no chance of missing it in the water. The marsh is said to be dry or nearlyLAND ROUTES so in the summer months. By making a detour of some miles to the S. the marshy part to be crossed is said to be less, but the route described seems to be the regular caravan route. 50f The marsh is left, and the plain regained, in the hollows of which there is an abundance of short green grass. 58| Small stream, with an occasional pool of sweet water (in spring ?). From here the ground slopes down gently to Mandali. 64 The Mafat River, a sluggish stream 20 to 25 yds. wide and 6 ft. deep, with steep earth-banks lined with reeds and tamarisk scrub. In the hot weather the water is not only unpleasantly flavoured with petroleum, but is un wholesome to drink, causing diarrhoea. The banks of the Nafat are at present impassable for carts, but ramps could easily be made, for the soil is a soft red sandy loam. 66f Ford over the river, which is some 40 yds. wide and 2 ft. deep, with easy approaches. Bottom muddy. 68 The large tomb of Nabi Tehran or Imam 'Abdallah is passed, on a mound m. to the S. A stream flows mid way between it and the road. There are several springs and streams passed in this dip, all brackish and unfit to drink, and the ground is thickly covered with saline incrusta tions. The only vegetation is a few low bushes. ^OJ A f ew scattered fields of barley as the town is approached. 73 Mandali, village situated in a large patch of date gardens. It is surrounded by trees in walled gardens similar to, but much more extensive than, those in Beledruz. The houses are largely built of mud or sun-dried bricks, and the enclosure walls in nearly every case of mud. Mandali is on ground sloping to the S., and is amply supplied with good water, which is brought by a canal taken off, from the Gangir River, at a distance of about 3 m. to the NE. of the town. This canal divides into three branches, of which one turns northwards without entering the town and is lost in the desert about 6 m. to the N. of Mandali. (This branch may be almost parallel to the first part of Boute 29). The other two branches pass through the town and bifurcate in various directions on the way. The supplies available at Mandali are of the same kind as at Beledruz, but about treble the quantity. There is ample water in the Ganglr River all the year round.

The banks are greatly shelving and the bottom is pebbly. At the time when the snows have begun to melt the stream is probably much larger. The road continues in a general NE. direction. It runs at first through the narrow street and date gardens between high mud walls, and crossing several small irrigation channels emerges on to the plain and follows the edge of the enclosures. Date-groves end, and road crosses a wide grassy plain, leading towards gap in the range in front. Two small irrigation canals 6 ft. wide and 2 ft. deep are crossed. Small date plantations, with tombs dotted along side these canals. There are also several mills, and the banks are lined for a short distance with barley crops. The clay soil ends here, and the ground becomes stonier and rougher. The Rud-Klianeh-i-Gangir or Ab-i-Ravan (Ganglr Eiver) lies 500 yds. S., running in a wide gravel bed along several small channels. The road crosses some low undulations. Route lies along the course of the river here 400 yds. wide. The water is brackish, and the banks quite bare of vegetation. On the 1. bank are some low sandstone cliffs. The Turco-Persian frontier is here marked by a pile of stones standing just at the mouth of the open valley through which the road now runs, leaving the plain. The road is a good 30-ft. track over red sandstone and gravelly conglomerate. This open defile, where the river debouches into the plain, is known as the Tang-i- Stuimar. Road continues up the valley, here about 1 m. wide, bordered by low undulating hills. A small and very brackish stream enters on the left bank from the direction of Jebel Atish. Naphtha springs lie in that direction. The river here winds considerably. [From this point only a summary is here given of the detailed report in Routes in Persia, vol. iii, no. 95.] Road continues up Ganglr Valley by a track generally easy200 LAND KOUTES Miles from Bagiidad 98i 105 1071 108| 109| 1101 mi 1141 and broad, occasionally crossing spurs of hills over gravelly or stony soil.

Then fairly easy till- bteep rocky spur juts across valley causing river to make a sharp bend. The track ascends a side valley for a short distance and then turns up over the ridge, following a steep ascent for 300 yds. by a series of short zigzags. Road descends into the river valley and again reaches a wide grassy terrace overlooking river-bed. A cutting in the soft shale round the extremity of the ridge would make this into a good cart-road, i About 1 m. farther on the road becomes for 500 yds. a track along a 1 to 2 foot ledge taking advantage of the broken parts of nearly vertical strata overhanging the river. It is impossible to avoid this bad portion as the river is not fordable here. Cuttings in the soft shale would not be difficult. The road then becomes a broad track closely overlooking the cliff along the left bank. Pass through Tang-i-Slintar Gardan gorge. Ford liver. The ford is 40 yds. wide and 2 ft. deep over a rough, rocky bed in a rapid stream. Approach and ascent easy. Eoad now enters Sambak Valley. Road turns sharply to the right up a side valley, the Tam Valley, the track following bed of a small stream. Valley gradually opens out into the wide undulating plain of Cham-i-Surkh, rising towards the N. with some signs of irrigation and cultivation, with several side valleys. The stream flowing through this plain is crossed four times. Camping-ground in centre of valley. The only supplies wou d consist of sheep and goats, which could be pur chased from the nomads in large numbers. Water from the stream good. Grazing excellent. rEOUTE 28 b 201 General direction to Zarneh Valley is SE. Eoad at first follows a broad track up the centre of the valley on the stream bank inclining towards N.E. and gradually ascending. Several small springs in the hill-sides, and the water-supply good and abundant. On the W. of the plain is a curious isolatedhill called the Qal'ali-i-Markai'a, the top of the hill being crowned by a cliff 60 ft. high and the ruins of an old fort. Koad skirts slope of Bagh Kuh range to E.: lower slopes earth, with large boulders ; shrubs, stunted ilex, and oak. Eoad turns up through the Tang-i-Klmshk and ascends a gentle slope up a valley. Gilan Kuli, a steep, rocky ridge bounding the valley to the NW., lies to 1. The pass is a deep gap between this and the Bagh Kuh. At the foot of the pass the gradient is 5° and the valley is 60 to 80 yds. broad with a small stream. The road winds among trees and boulders and is stony, but is fairly easy going. The ascent to the summit of the pass is gradual the whole way, and could be made a good cart-road. It is at present passable for artillery. Summit of pass, 1,875 ft. above the Cham-i-Surkh Plain. Immediately below to the NE. lies a deep narrow valley running down towards the Ganglr. The road from the summit keeps along that side of this valley and is rough and narrow ; in places it is only an 8 to 5 ft. ledge. Soil rich clay covered with grass. After 2 m. the road descends by a series of sharp zigzags. Eoad takes a sharp bend through the lower pass, also known as the Tang-i-Khushk. The pass is a rift in the mountain range from 30 to 40 yds. wide, the total length being 1,300 yds., bordered by precipitous cliffs of grey limestone. The road is rough and stony and in the spring a torrent sweeps down the centre. It is level throughout and for the last 300 yds. the track lies in the dry bed of the torrent. There are several caves at the N. mouth of the pass. ^ m. farther on the road opens out into a narrow valley with steep stony sides, and -J m. farther emerges into the Mindar Valley running NW. in the direction of Gilan and SE . in the direction of Zarneh.

It slopes gradually towards the centre and numerous small streams are passed flowing towards Zarneh. These join the head-waters of the Ganglr. Ruins of village of Zarueh. on a large tumulus 200 yds. in diameter and 100 ft. above the plain. A few of the houses are still standing. Just north of the tumulus lies a large spring called the Chasmeh-i-Zarueh, from which a stream of good water issues. Numerous other small springs are passed and water is abundant at all times of the year. The plain grows good grass, and patches of Indian corn are sown on it by nomads as soon as snow is off the ground. At southern end of plain is Manisht Kuh. The road leaves Zarneh Plain and turns up through a pass in the ridge bordering it on the E. The pass is 30 to 40 ft. wide at its narrowest, and 400 yds. at its broadest, bordered by steep grassy slopes dotted with a few trees and topped with steep rugged cliffs. The track is leve], but the going is rough owing to loose stones which might at parts easily be cleared away. At times the road follows the dry bed of a stream. Road emerges into a small grassy valley -J- m. broad bordered on the N. by a steep ridge called the Gnmir Kuh im passable on this side because of sheets of vertical limestone strata. The valley runs up 2 m. in a NW. direction and is well wooded. The road leads diagonally across the valley. To the S. lie the undulating table-land and hills of Asimabad or Asiuanabad, where are the extensive ruins of an ancient city. A long gradual slope rises from here to the flat summit of Manisht Kuh. Head of the valley is reached and the road turns E. up156 KOUTE 28 b 203 a stony, rough ascent for 400 yds. through trees.

The head of the Cliillav Valley is passed. Track descends from the head of the col into it and then turns north again and emerges into A small grassy basin shut in between hills. This place, Charmilleh camp, is sometimes used by the nomads as a camping-ground. Supplies, especially live stock, might be obtained from the nomads. A road runs through the Chiliav Valley from CHlan, and another branches off here to Harunabad through Guar. Through the valley also passes a route from Ser-i-Pul (i-zuhab) to Deh Bala. See Eoutes in Persia, vol. iii, 97. The route now goes in a general N. direction to Tirau camp. Begin the ascent of the Kalaja Kuh, a lofty rocky ridge separating the road from the Harunabad district. Track rough at times: it could be improved by clearing loose stones.

Summit of Derbend-i-Kalaja Pass. This is the highest point on the route. The crest of the ridge, a rounded summit, lies 1,000 ft. higher to the right. The descent of the northern slope of the range is much steeper and occasionally rough, but becomes easier towards the end. Foot of the range is reached and the route strikes across the Guar Valley, which extends for some 20 to 25 miles. It averages 3 to 4 m. in width and is covered with abundance of fine grass and watered by numerous small springs and streams from the foot of the border ranges.

The road crosses a hollow, said to be the ancient bed of the river, in which there is water in high floods. River bank is reached. The stream is about 150 yds. wide, with a moderate current. It runs in a deep bed sunk 25 to 30 ft. below the general level of the plain with steep earth banks. Ferry, as last reported, consisted of an old hull of a native craft which carried about six animals. Bahriz, 400 houses on 1. bank of the stream. There are two caravanserais and a small but well-supplied bazaar, in which grain and dates, &amp;c., are procurable in abun dance, and fruit in autumn. Supplies plentiful. Good water from the river. Grass on the plain in the spring. Road now goes in a general E. direction. Leaving the caravanserai the road at first skirts the Khorasan Canal, crossing several small side channels emerging fromEOUTES 29, 30, 81 207 Miles from Baghdad sii 33 36 394 41| 42 44i 52i it. The track is 10 to 12 ft. wide, through barley and wheat fields. Good clover and grass on the waste land. The canals are mostly 4 ft. wide and 1 ft. deep, and easily crossed. The main channels are 6 to 8 ft. deep, and difficult for mules. Flocks of sheep and goats are grazed on the plain. Small shrine of Imam Abu Feyyab passed 1 m. to the S. There is a cluster of huts, with a few date-trees round it. This forms a good landmark on the plain. The belt of irrigated land now gradually ceases, and open alluvial plain commences. The shrine of Abu Khums lies about 6 m. to the S. Irrigation cuts are left, and the route strikes across the plain in a direction almost due E. Winding track. Shehr Habib, extensive ruins, strewn with broken pottery and bricks, marking site of an ancient town. Water lodges close by in some of the hollows of old canals, where plenty of green grass is to be found. Good water hereabouts, apparently from canal. The last of the brick mounds is passed. Small tomb 2 m. to the S. on a mound. Marshy hollow, about 1 m. square, to the N. The water in these hollows is not good, but is sweet and drinkable. A few Arab encampments with flocks of sheep and goats may be seen. The general direction of the canals is NE. and SW. They are not in straight lines, but wind in all directions. Eoad reaches the W. side of the large grove of dates, in which Beledruz (also written Baladoz) is situated. (For description, see Route 28 b, m. 46.) KOUTE 31 BAGHDAD—BAQUBEH (47 m.) Via the Diyaleh Beidge and Left Bank op the Diyaleh Eivee Authority : Route Report of January 1904 For main road to Baqubeh see JRo 28 a. In 1904 the country for 2 m. above the mouth of the Diyaleh (m. 9), near Bahrlz (m. 43),ir i 208 LAND ROUTES and between that place and Baqubeh, was cut up by numerous waW cuts which were impassable for wheels. The soil on the 1 bank f the Diyaleh is a sandy clay, in places heavy going. The authoritv above referred to calls the country on the river bank, from 2 m. aboJ the Diyaleh mouth to near Bahrlz, open desert. But another account describes the plain to the E, of the river in the region of Abu 'AnV as bearing abundant short grass in winter (which, however dries m completely in summer) and as containing patches of cultivation herp and there in the hollows.

In 1904 this bridge consisted of 16 boats, with one spare boat 1 each was flat-bottomed, 32 ft. long, 12 ft. wide, and 6 ft. deep. The bridge was divided into four sections connected by planking. The banks at the bridge, though ramped, were reported steep (about 20°) and difficult for wheels. In the neighbourhood of the bridge they were precipitous and 30 ft. above water, A few mud huts at each end of the bridge. Turn NNE., and ascend 1. bank of Diyaleh Eiver. Many water-cuts, described in 1904 as ' very difficult or rather impassable for wheels without a little bridging or ramping Water-cuts cease. Country 'an open desert—cultivable but uncultivated in all directions' (1904). In this neighbourhood there was in 1904 an encampment of Arabs belonging to a small tribe called Neza Da'ag (?). The authority already mentioned ' camped in their vicinity after having marched for six hours' (from Baghdad). V Continue along 1. bank over open sandy plain. In some places the sandy dust is heavy and trying to animals. Track crosses and recrosses several times an old dry canal or river bed, marked on recent maps as the iNah rawun Canal, on earlier ones, apparently, as the old bed of the Diyaleh.

In this neighbourhood the authority of 1904 crossed the ( old bed of the Diyaleh ' (Nahrawan Canal ?, see p. 33) at the point where it took off from the Diyaleh. He adds, ' This point was about 5 m. S. of Abu Khums, and the alignment on the map (Sheet 56, SW. Asia Series) of this old bed of the Diyaleh is quite misleading. At this point it looks as if the bank of the present stream were giving way on the E. side, and as if the river would in a high flood again take the old bed. This might result in a large marsh near Sifweh, which would probably affect the climate and health of Baghdad.' Pass Abu XEhuins, a shrine in the plain, apparently 2-3 m. E. of the river. As Bahrlz is approached, the country is much broken by water-cuts with narrow plank bridges. These water- cuts would be quite impassable for artillery or wheeled transport (1904). Bahriz.

Authority ;—Lorimer, Report on a Tour in Turkish Arabia and Kurdistan in April-May 1910. This route lies over open rolling country, the only serious obstacle to artillery being the Diyaleh Eiver (see m. 13-|). On the W. side of the river the road is reported to be frequently intersected by small ravines, few if any of them more than 12 ft. deep and 20 ft. broad, and probably all capable of being easily made passable for artillery. The country seems to be fairly well populated, and there is a certain amount of cultivation. Water seems sufficient, but there is no information with regard to a water-supply, beyond MES. Ill o210 LAND KOUTES the references to streams in the itinerary. Clover was seen here and there E. of the Diyaleh. The times given in the text of the itinerary are from the authority mentioned above : they are those of riders, not of the baggage caravan.

This track is over level ground all the way, and suitable for guns and wheeled transport, though the soft soil would make very bad going after rain or the passage of heavy traffic. The only serious obstacle is the Diyaleh (see m. 25 below). Sheep and goats plentiful, and perhaps some other supplies from villages in the Diyaleh Valley. Water plentiful in the Diyaleh Valley (canals from river). Very- good spring grazing. Fuel plentiful. Good camping-ground near the Diyaleh.

Authority :—Routes in Persia, vol, ii 7 no. 72, On at least one stage there seems to be some confusion in the authority with regard to distances : see under m. 20^. The report dates from 1888; the route was apparently traversed at some time in the dry season. The route appears to be very little used. The track is often ill-defined, and is much intersected by streams and ravines. It would be unsuitable for wheeled traffic without much previous preparation and labour. The Diyaleh River would need bridging: this, it is stated, could be easily done by pontoons or trestles. In 1888 good crops were passed Cattle were available in limited numbers. Water from streams, &amp;c., throughout. Forage scarce. No information as to fuel. Transport not obtainable.- 216 Miles from Qasr-i- Shirin o LAND EOUTES Qasr-i-Shlriu. General direction to Merkez W. Leave Qasr-i-Shlrln and strike across some low, gravelly un- dulations by a well-defined track, in direction 258° (W. by S.). Soil, light clay and gravel, growing thin grass mostly burnt up in dry season. For 1 m. out of town, barley and wheat crops (1888). Gradient ascends gradually till a few pools and little streams are passed in a ravine. Gradient now becomes steeper, ascending low, rounded range of conglomerate hills. Broad, easy track over ridge, which can be passed at any point. Grass sometimes available in hollows, Bounded summit of ridge, alt. 2,020 ft. (a rise of nearly 600 ft. from the start). Cross it skirting a dry, gravelly ravine to r. Along the summit of the ridge runs the Turco-Persian frontier, as settled in 1914. The NW. side of ridge is cut up by several long ravines running towards the Diyaleh. Begin easy descent along ridge of a spur ; valley with dry water-course to 1. Wide view over Diyaleh Valley, a gently undulating country intervening. Short steep descent for 100 yds. from end of spur at junction of two valleys. Valley to r. contains gravelly bed of stream 150-200 yards wide; stream in valley to 1. nearly dry in l.w. season. Water disappears in this gravelly soil, but could be found in wells or Follow stream bank: easy going over gravel and pebbles. Track in 1888 seemed to be hardly ever used. Stream contains good clear water. Tall hedges on banks; no trees in sight; some fields of Indian corn close by. Pass round masonry tower, some 30 ft. high, on spur to r. This in 1888 was a frontier mark (but see above). A line of these towers runs about NNW. towards Diyaleh (341°), and between SSW. and S. by W. (197°) towards Khanikin. Pass through some low gravelly mounds, and emerge into a fiat valley 1 m. wide.

The northern side slopes very gradually towards the Diyaleh Valley. Grass on hill-slopes poor, but improves nearer the valley. Track easy and gravelly. Salahi village, ^ m. to r. of track, surrounded by three large orchards and cultivation. General direction to Sheikh Sa'id on farther side of Diyaleh, K (Another Sheikh Sa'id is passed just after leaving Salahi.) With regard to this stage there appears to be some confusion in the route-book, and possibly in the W.O. map, sheet 38. The distance given between Salahi and Sheikh Sa'id in Routes in Persia vol. ii, no. 72, is 20 miles. This seems to be too long, unless a very considerable detour is made, of which there is no mention in the report. On the other hand, Hamrala is marked on the map as lying to the S. of Salahi, whereas the Sheikh Sa'id which is passed near Salahi is placed about WSW. of Salahi, between it and the Diyaleh. The Diyaleh Kiver at about 5 m. from Salahi, on bearing 26° (slightly E. of NNE.), breaks through a ridge in the hills and emerges into the plain. Cross large canal which runs through Salahi and irri gates country between it and river by numerous minor cuts. Canal 20 ft. broad and about 2 ft. deep. On the eastern bank the ground slopes up, and is drier and less cultivated. Clay track 15-20 ft. wide, through wheat fields, follows r. bank of canal. Pass deep irrigation cut 8 ft. wide and sunk 6-8 ft. below the surface. It is crossed by rough bridge of tree trunks with fascines and earth: there are several of these little bridges, otherwise the canal would be difficult for laden mules. Several mills dotted about the plain, each with a loopholed watch-tower some 30 ft. high. Pass Hamr'ala village (150 houses, some well-built of218 Miles from lasr-i- hirin. 25i(?) 29A(?)

Extending S. from here is a well-cultivated plain 8-10 m. long, dotted with several villages, each surrounded by an orchard. Another ruin mound 1 m. to r. From Hamr'ala cross plain to NW., approaching the Diyaleh. Soil fertile, irrigated by numerous small canals; narrow track through tall grass and cornfields. Pass Shaki village, 250 houses in 1888, including some good two-storied buildings, but apparently suffering from Hamawand raids; low mud wall breached in several places round village. Good crops of wheat and rice grown in this valley. Eafts constructed here for passage of the river in 1888: none ready-made. On nearing river enter belt of tall hedges and osiers extending to river-bank. Diyaleh Eiver. The river flows in a wide gravelly bed, with several channels. The course taken by the stream varies from year to year, and also the point for crossing. Rafts can only take light loads in high water. Mules and horses have to be swum across. When the river was crossed in 1888 there were broad sedgy flats and creeks on the 1. bank, and on the r, low gravel cliffs 25 ft. high, with ruins of small village. The main deep channel was then near r. bank, and the other channels were fordable. Opposite ford the ruins of a small village. Route from r. bank passes low gravelly undulations covered with a little grass. Soil improves, and, later, cultivation (wheat and barley) is to be seen. No cultiva tion or irrigated ground on r. bank, which rises rapidly to some low undulations on the 1. Pass dry gravelly bed of ravine from 1.

Gradually ascend a low range of hills on r. bank of Gok Su. Turn up side valley over some low spurs. This range is called Jebel Kushki (Dry Hill) owing to absence of water in ravines. Best line to Salahiyeh is parallel to ridge, the general direction of which is from NW. by N. to SE. by S.; it is easily passable at any point. No well-defined road, but several small paths.

Then follows a single 12 ft. arch with a paved roadway 8 ft. wide. 20 yds. farther the stream makes a sharp turn under the base of the cliff, and there is another bridge similar to the first. The road could be rendered impassable by the destruction of either of these bridges (called the Pul-i-Kalakh). Both arches were in a bad state of repair in 1888. The arch of the second was supplemented by a few sticks and fascines. (There is much confusion here in the times and distances as printed in the Military Report The distance given above between the top of the Zagirmeh Pass and the Tang-i-Kalakh (8f m.) is that given in the Military Report. The time at which the Tang-i-Kalakh was reached is given as 1.8 a.m. The next entry is under 10.18 a.m. A halt was apparently made at or near the Tang-i-Kalakh, but the time at which the march was resumed is not stated.

Via Dae Authority.—'Report of a journey, made apparently in 1909 (report dated February 19, 1910). This is not a main caravan track, but is used by caravans of mules and ponies in summer and in winter when the passes are open. The track, as far as Dar (m. 34), is bad for mules and impassable for camels, and requires improvement for any kind of transport. The last 9 m. require repair for camels. The country traversed consists of rolling downs and stony hills, generally low. The passes over the Qara Dagh are the chief obstacles : in winter they may be closed by snow, but this does not always happen. The plain of Suleimaniyeh is cultivated ; but beyond Temai', until Salahiyeh is reached, practically no supplies are obtainable apart from sheep and goats, which are plentiful throughout. Water reported plentiful from streams at Temar (m. 22), good supply from a stream at Dar (m. 34), abundant from the Aq Su at m. 58, and plentiful throughout the stage from Ibrahim Khanji (m. 60) to Salahiyeh. Grazing reported very good at Temar, Dar, Ibrahim Khanji, and thence to Salahiyeh. Fuel plentiful throughout. No transport. This route touches Boute 34 a at Temar and at Ibrahim Khanji, but the details of the two accounts cannot be reconciled. Miles from Sulei maniyeh o Suleimaniyeh.

Beyond the Eiver Sirvan (tm. 70) the route is practi cally only a mule-track, and in some places narrows down to 2 ft in width. The Sirvan Eiver and the Qara Su near Kirmanshah when in flood present the only serious obstacles. Movements in the mountains would be somewhat hampered by snow in winter. Between Halebjeh and Sirvan the construction of a cart-road would be difficult, as hill-cutting would be necessary for a few miles (1886). The snow in winter is nowhere very severe and the summer heat is not excessive. Large flocks of sheep and goats and herds of cattle are met with on most of the stages. Cultivation is not very extensive, but fruit of all kinds is plentiful. Luxuriant pasture is to be found in most of the valleys, but the supply of grain is limited. Water from streams is plentiful throughout, A sort of low oak scrub which might supply fuel grows on the hills in many of the stages. Near Mohun (m. 25) and Eavar (m. 97) is much liquorice. Numbers of donkeys can be obtained at various places for trans port. These animals will carry three-fifths of a mule-load at 2| m. an hour. Miles from Sulei- maniyeh 0 The road from Suleimaniyeh keeps at first close to the foot of the hills on the l. ? with considerable undulations. The surface is generally firm; width about 18 ft. General direction to Mohun SE. Later the valley is 6-7 m. broad, with abundant wheat, barley, and grass; the hills on either side are 1,000-1,500 ft. above the valley. Some of the steeper gradients into the ravines would require to be improved for wheeled traffic.EOUTE 35 233 Valley here 10-12 m. broad, mostly covered with grass. The hills begin to recede to the N.

General direction of track to Halebjeh SE. The track winds over the flat towards the hills on the S., crossing many streams flowing in deep channels between steep banks of clay. Liquorice root, grown here for firewood, is plentiful. Two streams, banks flush with the plain. One of these streams is 100 ft. wide and 3 ft. deep, the other 40 ft. wide and 2^ ft. deep. The valley here is about 15 m. broad, and in the high-water season swampy in places. Pasture luxuriant; numerous nomad encampments and villages with large flocks of sheep and herds of cattle. A good many horses are to be seen. Halebjeh, small town among gardens, which has developed greatly in recent years. Bazaar. Head-quarters of the Jaf Kurds. Climate hot in May ; some snow in winter. Route to Penjevin (40 m.), very bad from Zangisar (m. 25), From Halebjeh to Nausud (m. 68 below) the general direction of the track is E., width 10-15 ft., leading across the head of the valley through which it has hitherto run, and over foot-hills.

This route runs close beside the main road, and is said to touch the latter about 8 m. beyond Sadikabad. Road passable for all arms except at two or three points; but in 1897 it was reported inferior for troops to the main road. A trestle-bridge or cutting for guns would be needed at the Ab-i-Mark (about m. 22), the banks of the Lilufar stream (m. 42) need easing for guns, and small parts of the road between Patlabad (m. 28) and Dustavand (m. 43|) are liable to flood. Supplies on the whole good; water plentiful; grazing good after Shaliabad (about 15 m.) ; little or no fuel. See Routes in Persia, vol. ii, 75. (ii) Via Khaglistan. This is a detour to E. (about 54-66 m. according to the season), following route (iii) below for about 16 m. and branching off to S. a few miles from Kamara (Kamaran). Beyond that point it is a camel road which could with slight improvements be made passable for artillery, but a detour ESE. has to be made near Kir- manshah in winter and spring when the Qara Su is unfordable. Good water throughout; few supplies, little fuel and forage. See Routes in Persia, vol. ii, 78. (iii) Via Bilavar Valley and Tang '-i -Kiiiish.k ; a long detour to E. (75 m.). Fair track, only in parts passable for all arms; no great difficulties in road construction. Water plentiful. Supplies and fuel generally very scarce ; grazing good. See Routes in Persia, vol. ii 76.

In parts this route is practicable for led animals only, and would require considerable labour and expense to render it suitable for all arms. Military operations on it would be difficult in winter. Crops are met with along the greater part of the route. There are no details as to grazing, except what may be inferred from the presence of animals in villages. The only mention of fuel occurs near Barudar, 30 m. from Senna, and round Suleimaniyeh. In the former case the quantity is probably limited. Water is on the whole plentiful. The only local means of transport are the donkeys to be found in the neighbourhood of Suleimaniyeh. Considerable labour would be required to improve the road over the Qal'ah Kal Ya'qub (beyond Barudar, m. 114), and the Gerdilan River (m. 73) would also be a serious obstacle unless the bridge has been repaired. An alternative route goes by Harmaleh, rejoining the main route about m. 41 (see Route 36 b). It seems also that there is a third route by 'Alaweh, S. of that described, and rejoining it at m. 32, but no details regarding it are available.KOUTES 35, 36 a 237 attle.

ROUTE 37 KIEKUK—SULEIMANIYEH The country between Kirkuk and Suleimaniyeh consists of open rolling uplands. The Hamawand Kurds who live here are noted brigands and fighters. In 1887 a route from Kirkuk to Suleimaniyeh MES. Ill 0242 LAND KOUTES was reported on, which was said to be passable for wheels as far as the Baziyan Pass. The report on the route, which is given below under (A), has, it is stated, been confirmed by recent local informa tion. In 1903 a route from Kirkuk to the Baziyan Pass Kurga was found 'just passable for carriages', and a road similarly described led from the pass to Suleimaniyeh. (Possibly Routes (A) and (B) coincide from Chemchemal.) In 1909 a journey from Kirkuk to Suleimaniyeh via Chemchemal, and, apparently, the Baziyan Pass was made by a track which was said to be quite unfit for wheels except in the last 16 m. into Suleimaniyeh. It is impossible to say exactly what is the relation between the route (given under (C) below) and the road or roads described in 1887 and 1908. In 1909 a traveller, accompanying a caravan, made a detour to the N. through the Shuan country to avoid the Baziyan Pass. His route is referred to under (E) below. The only supplies to be obtained in any quantity between Kirkuk and Suleimaniyeh would be sheep and goats from the nomad Kurds. In peace time large flocks and herds pastured on these uplands at least from October till June. Beyond Chemchemal very few per manent villages, and these deserted April-No v. Water is reported plentiful on Route (A) between Kirkuk and Chemchemal. On Route (B), in spring 1903, it was reported scarce throughout. In 1909 a good supply was found at Chemchemal (wells and small streams) and Khan Jariyeh (stream). In the Shuan country to N. (see Route (E)) water is scarce in summer. Grazing is very good in spring and until June, especially in the Shuan country and in the Baziyan Valley. Fuel is very scarce. An uncertain quantity of mules, horses, and donkeys might be collected from the neighbouring tribes (A) Authority ;—Military Report on Eastern Turkey in Asia, vol. iii, 106 (a report of 1887). Miles from Kirkuk 0 Kirkuk. The route leaves in an E. direction over low gravelly hills, and is stony and steep in places. Water was reported plentiful (?) in 1887, but country mainly pastoral, with a fair number of villages at first. It would appear that it is not difficult to miss the right track, there being numerous side-tracks to Kurd villages. 30 Chemchemal, small town (about 200 houses). T.O. In 1887 there was a post of 250 infantry and a battery ofKOUTE 37 243 Miles from Kirkuk mountain guns. In 1909, 8,000 troops were collected here to deal with the Hamawand brigands. From Chemchemal the road continues over gravelly hills. 38 Baziyan Pass, an opening in the Qara Dagh, with room for two caravans to pass. There are still to be seen the ruins of a wall built across the neck of the pass by 'Abd er-rahman Pasha of Suleimaniyeh in 1805, in an attempt to assert the independence of this part of Kurdistan. NW. of the pass are the Chemala and Khalkalan ranges of earth hills, of no great height, with furrowed sides. 41 Deir Gezin, Kurdish village, with streams from the Qara Dagh. The road now enters the Eaziyan Valley, or plain, down the middle of which runs a line of hills lower than the Qara Dagh. The road passes N. of the end of this ridge. Baziyan village, the chief Hamawand village, lies a little way up the plain. 50 The road crosses the hills by an easy pass near the Taslnji Tepeh, down to the Suleimaniyeh Plain, open undulating ground, with several streams, all fordable, though the Ehanjiru or Bakhan is deep and swift as late as May. 66 Suleimaniyeh.. 2,500 houses.

Soane, To Mesopotamia an (The journey from Kirkuk to Suleimaniyeh was made in the spring of 1909.) In order to avoid the Baziyan Pass, where the Hamawand Kurds were plundering caravans, and also to obtain the protection of the Shuan Kurds who were friendly with the Hamawands, the caravan with which Mr. Soane travelled (a large one including 70 soldiers) struck off the ordinary Kirkuk—Suleimaniyeh route a few miles out of Kirkuk, and marched almost due N. into the Shuan country, open grassy downs with excellent pastures. The caravan suffered at first from lack of water. Long stops were made, the days being divided into morning and evening marches with a rest for some hours at noon. Apparently on the second day a point was reached from which the Lesser Zab could be seen. On the third day the caravan turned southwards, and leaving the Shuan country entered that of the Hamawands. Towards sunset, after passing through well-watered, well-wooded country with fine pastures, the Baziyan Valley, 2 m. wide, was reached. On the fourth day the caravan crossed a neck in the Tasluji Hills and descended to the plain of Suleimaniyeh. ROUTE 38 SULEIMANIYEH—EANIYEH (75^ m.)

This also goes by the Ziyaret Heib es-Sultan; after traversing the Heib es-Sultan Dagh it crosses the Kelek Khan Valley, leaves Nahrawan to 1., turns northward near Khudran village, and then crosses the route described above, passing over the Dahli Bisman, a small range of fiveROUTES 40, 41 257 a peaks about 4 m. from Eaniyeh, while the main route skirts round the SE. end of this line of hills. Sykes took 3 hrs. to Khudran village, and 3 hrs. again from that point to Raniyeh. There seems to be very little difference in the length between the two routes.

Authorities:— Routes in Persia, vol. ii, Route 106 (reports of 1888, 1902, and 1905). Military Report on E .T .A., vol. iii. Route 108, pp. 269-70. The distances given in Routes in Persia for the stage from Raniyeh to Shlamatte (Shalmatti) are confused, probably owing to misreading of the account in the B.port onE.T.A. The nature of the road varies greatly, and, from the information given, it is doubtful whether it would be passable, except here and there, for guns or carts and transport. It is very hilly and stony with steep inclines in some parts, in others the track crosses muddy rice-fields and marshy valleys. From Ser Desht to Banah the route goes over a good open road and would probably be passable for all arms at all times. There are two intricate fords at 7fm. and 131 m. from Eaniyeh which are difficult to cross without guides. Many of the streams in the valleys are liable to flood, and would then have to be crossed higher up, necessitating considerable detours. No exact data can be given regarding supplies, but a limited amount could probably be got from the villages. Forage, fuel, and water are fairly plentiful in parts, especially near Eaniyeh. Water is chiefly from streams or springs and is plentiful everywhere except in hills. No details can be given about transport. The climate is good in general, cultivation of most kinds flourishing. Between Eaniyeh and Ser Desht, however, the roads are blocked by snow from the middle of December to the middle of March. Whether this is due merely to the small amount of traffic, or whether the route is rendered quite impassable, is not stated, but the former seems possible. mes. m jj258 LAND ROUTES Miles from Baniyeli o 6 7|? 10i 12 131 Raniyeh.

Route here rounds a spur and enters Eaba Derbend, defile by which the Lesser Zab issues from Pishder into Eaniyeh Plain. A narrow rocky ridge extends NW. to the Qandil Bagh, and a similar ridge to the Kerkur Dagh. The gap is 300 yds. broad ; the river being 80 yds. wide, 6 to 8 ft. deep, and unfordable. There is no track on 1. bank of Lesser Zab into Pishder. On the r. bank is a track, 18 ft. wide, well revetted, but loose stones and boulders require to be removed to make it passable for guns.

In spring the river fills this wide bed. On the 1. is a succession of low spurs, terminating in the banks under which the road runs. Between these are gullies down which streams flow to join the Zab. The valleys are marshy, which makes the streams difficult to ford although they are not deep, but in spring it would be necessary to ford higher up. Kharaju, small Mangur village under the bank.

This track crosses broken country with two bad hills to Bireli Kafra, about 7 hrs. from 'Aqreh. From there about 3 hrs. easy going takes one to a raft ferry across the Zab at Uizan. The next 3 hrs. are steep and stony and mostly up-hill to Baibarun, from which the road is difficult for about 8 hrs. to Slieitaneh., a place which grows good tobacco. From Sheitaneh the road is fairly easy, through hills, to Rowanduz about 5 hrs. farther on. These times appear to be at the rate of 2-2^ m.p.h. The track now descends a long stony gully and crosses a swift stream, Jodah., village consisting partly of caves, on the 1.: about 15 houses of Surchi Kurds.

Near it is the village of Qarateh (60 houses of Surchi Kurds). Susnaweh village, 30 houses of Surchi Kurds, on the outer slope of a range of hills, possibly a continuation of the Harir Hills, running towards the Great Zab. The track now winds along watersheds between complicated valley systems, all apparently draining into the Great Zab. In places the track is steep and narrow, but quite passable for horses. The hills are a gravelly conglomerate, covered with grass and clover. Qandil ferry. In 1910 there was only one of 18 skins. In l.w. the river is fordable a little way below the ferry.

Cham-i-Klialifan, open camping-ground. Khallfan village, seven houses, on the opposite side of the Khalifan stream. The track now runs for over 2 m. down the gorge of the Khallfan, here called the Gali 'Ali Bey. A report of 1888 describes the upper end of the gorge as 30 yds. wide, but it broadens to 50 yds. a short distance on. River a rapid torrent. Road close to water's edge. Height of cliffs increases. About 13 min. from Khallfan village, cross wooden bridge of three spans with masonry piers. Bridge (in 1888) 35 yds. long, with 10-ft. roadway. In 1910 its upper structure consisted of strong timbers overlaid with earth and brushwood. It had no parapets. Round rocky spur by good 12-ft. road (1888) among enormous boulders.LAND KOUTES Border cliffs 250-300 ft. high ; valley 200-250 yds. wide In 1888 the track passed along river bed for 50 yds. through 2 ft. of water round spur. This is not mentioned in tL report of 1910. 6 Lablai waterfall. It is not possible to get a satisfactory view of it from the track. The fall is very high, and the water pours over undivided. Towards the end of the gorge the valley is 300 yds. wide with cliffs 400-500 ft. high on either side. The river is 10 yds. wide, 3-6 ft. deep, with a rapid current over boulders. The road, in 1888, was an easy track 12-15 ft. broad following the r. bank, generally 50 ft. above the water. It sometimes wound round boulders fallen from cliff above. Portions of it are paved. The banks of the river are wooded with oaks, sycamores, and shrubs. The Khalifan Eiver joins the Rowandnz Chai near this point. The gorge at the Eowanduz Chai is generally 30-40 yds. wide at the bottom, though sometimes it narrows to as many feet. The hill-sides are covered with low oak and brushwood. Precipices 1,500 ft. high on either side of the valley. The track now winds steeply up-hill, often over very bad surface. The rock is hard and slippery where worn smooth. Parts of the road (which in 1888 was 6-10 ft. wide) were de scribed in 1910 as cobbled and ridged across at intervals of 2-3 yds., the packing between consisting of large unshaped stones of -j-1 cubic foot in size. It was reported in 1888 that this made ascent was 3| m. in length, and was called the Serderiyeh Pass. In 1910 the made ascent seems to have been less long (it took between 40 min. and 1 hr. to walk down it); and it crossed the shoulder of the Kurek Dagh by a pass called Darakasab. Apparently the road described in 1888 crossed the Kurek Dagh higher up its slope. See note at end of route. As regards the name Serderiyeh, see Route 44 a, m. 1-|. There is no information as to the line of the new cart-road (1916). Pass called Saraibasab, a shoulder of ICureik Bagli. Bala- kyan Hill 2 m. to N.

Via the Euphrates Valley Authorities :—Dobbs's Keport of 1903; Mi (a report of April 1896) ; Bury, Baghdad — Aleppo Road, March-April 1907; Route reports of May-June 1905, Nov. 1905, and March 1908 and 1909; J. P. Peters, 1897 ; Sarre &amp; Herzfeld, ArchaologischeReise (journey of 1907-8) ; E. von Hoff- meister, Kairo — Baghdad— Konstantinopel (journey of 1908); oral information. This is a regular caravan route. Caravans take from 20 to 25 days; a carriage about 15 days. It is on the whole suitable for wheeled traffic, although some stretches are so sandy and others so stony as to necessitate slow going; the going is good over other stretches where the ground is level and hard. A 40-h .p. Argyll motor-car went over the stretch from Anah to Aleppo in 31 hrs. It experienced little difficulty up to Deir Hafir, except where the road was being remade near Tibni. There was one bad wadi, but once over the Tibni Hills the running to Sabkhah was excellent. Prom Deir Hafir the road was greasy after rain, and considerable difficulty was experienced. Prom Kaqqah to Aleppo a motor journey has been done in 8^ hrs. See note at m. 410. As far as Pellujeh there is a good, although unmetalled, driving road. At Pellujeh the route crosses the Euphrates and goes along its r. bank to Meskeneh via Hit and Anah. There are some troublesome wadis between Hit and Anah, which might require improvement for heavy wheeled traffic. There are also numerous gullies between Deir and Qishlaq Ma'dan, some of which are now bridged. At Meskeneh the route leaves the Euphrates, and stretches W. across a great unirrigated but not uncultivated plain to Aleppo. The road is at its worst in May when the river is in flood and the wadis are full of water, but even then it is passable for wheels. There are very few gradients, and those that do occur are short. BetweenEOUTE 46 289 ' Meskeneh and Aleppo the track by Tel Aghul (see left branch under m. 482, below) is said to be the better for military purposes, though it is not the usual caravan route. A good road could be made over this route ; for which purpose an ample supply of metal is obtainable at certain points on the route, as between Feheimeh and Anah and at Deir ez-Zor and Qishlaq Ma'dan; while there are no serious engineering difficulties : only a few stone bridges and culverts—no iron girders—would be required. In May and June it is said to be better to march by night, or evening and morning. Sandstorms are common below Anah. The mosquitoes are not intolerable, but a virulent sandfly is found in cer tain places, when neither man nor beast can sleep unless a strong breeze is blowing. During floods the difficulties and discomforts of this route are increased. Violent storms may also occur, including storms of very large hailstones. Within a few minutes after sunset a blast of cold air comes from the E. which may tear down a tent that is not properly fixed. Over many parts of the route there are probably alternative tracks besides those indicated in the itinerary. For Arab tribes on the route see Introduction to Euphrates Kiver Routes (pp. 94, 95). Compare Boutes IV E-H throughout. The T.L. follows the line of the route to Fellujeh and is carried across the Euphrates up-stream of Fellujeh; thence it accompanies the route. The poles for carrying the two wires are of wood near Fellujeh and Kamadiyeh, but elsewhere iron standards are used. Pits are dug round these poles to prevent caravan animals from pushing them out of position, but they have frequently to be set straight. Arabs occasionally damage the wires, and, from one cause or another, telegraphic communication may be altogether suspended for days together. The route passes, to a large extent, by irrigated or non-irrigated cultivation, through jungles of tamarisk, thorn, and liquorice, or over land which has rich pastures in spring. The irrigated cultivation is only on a narrow strip of the river bank, and is rather poor. No supplies can be relied on except for small parties. The best part of the route, as regards supplies, is from Meskeneh onwards. Water 1 ® | enera lly plentiful. Some pools are brackish, but the river water, although thick, is good. Watering-places would have to be prepared a nd ramps made in the banks. All along the route fuel is very scarce, especially in spring, when the sap is in the thorn or tamarisk scrub; there is a little wood in the large villages, and camel dung, ransport and live stock may be got from the nomad tribes, and is source of supply is naturally most abundant when the nomads mes. m m290 LAND KOUTES are using the pastures. After the second hour from Baghdad flocks of 80 to 100 sheep are met with. On leaving Fellujeh the track passes through corn land, and there are only occasional flocks. After 2 m. of cultivation the track from Kamadiyeh to Hit strikes across the desert. From Hit to Anah the track leads for the most part across the desert, touching the river at long*intervals. There are narrow strips of cultivation on the river hank. About Anah cultivation improves, but beyond Anah, between Nahiyeh and Abu'l Kemal, the river-valley is almost uncultivated. From Abu'l Kemal to Deir ez-Zor there is almost continuous but poor cultivation. Round Deir ez-Zor there is a belt of cultivation and good grazing. From Deir ez-Zor the cultivation becomes only occasional instead of continuous, but the route traverses a plain on which there is rich grazing. Continu ous cultivation begins again at Abu Hureireh. At Meskeneh the route leaves the Euphrates and runs through cultivated country. Of this stretch a traveller in 1906 says: ' On the way from Haleb (Aleppo) to Meskeneh, as far as the eye can see, there stretches a glorious tract of corn-bearing land, spotted with mud villages, containing a mixed race of people who reply equally readily in Turkish, Kurdish, or Arabic to the questions put by the passing traveller. Many of the villages are the property of wealthy citizens of Haleb, whose influence is sufficient to obtain protection for their tenants from the Government. The cultivation is not elaborate, but the ground is fairly tilled, and the continual influx of industrious people is steadily regenerating the land. ... At present the reclamation only extends within an hour of Meskeneh, but as the most easterly villages were only built last year, there is every hope that within a short time the river banks themselves will be populated.' Miles from Bagiidad 0 Baghdad. For details of the route as far as Fellujeh, see vol. ii, JRoute 22. For Decauville Railway to Ridhwaniyeh see p. 396. 43-| Pelliijeh. Here the route meets the Euphrates Valley and crosses by a bridge of boats from 1. to r. bank. Except in flood-time there is very little current; but in flood-time the crossing is difficult. At the bridge of boats the river is 200 to 250 yds. broad. Khan at each end of the bridge. The track starts at first S. by W. round a bend of the river, then generally W. by N. for 5 m. through corn-fields irrigated by cherrads (water-lifts). A few mud huts of settled Arabs. Many irrigation cuts. Ground rather heavy and liable to flood.A i .&lt;? 1 \\khj EOUTE 46 291 Track touches river and enters a plain. It is spoilt by sand drifts for 1 m. Sinthabaneh Hills to 1., behind which are said to be quarries of white stone. T.L. crosses from 1. bank. Low foot-hills (120 ft. high) dominate the track. Country becomes dead flat; good soil but no grass. Two shallow water-courses, sometimes dry, but having 2 to 3 ft. of water at flood. Ramadiyeh. Heavy going beyond this in the high-water season. Koad crosses tributary with banks 6 ft. high crossed by a single-arched stone bridge. Away from the river the ground is barren, and beyond is a waste of broken hills, but a continuous strip of cultivation follows the river banks. Cross Et-Tash. (Azeziyeh) Canal, 18 ft. broad, by an old single-arched brick bridge. This canal connects with the W. side of Lake Habbaniyeh, but is sometimes dry. Numerous neglected irrigation cuts with or without water are mentioned as occurring iij this part of the route, some of which form obstacles even to light wagons. The road, which for 2 m. from Eamadiyeh has gone through cultivation, strikes off across level desert through the country of the Beni Hasan tribe and some of the Dilaim. The former are here the more numerous. The ground becomes covered with tamarisk scrub, about the height of gorse ; soil sandy. Eoad reaches the river at the S. extremity of a great horse shoe bend. The river is here ^ m. broad. The road again leaves the river. Abu Ray at (Khan or Sheriyet Abu Rayat). Eoad rejoins river and rises 100 ft. over marble-like rock at the foot of which the river flows. The road is very rough here for carriages (1907). There are low hills on 1. bank, and the smoke of Hit bitumen pits can be seen. Cross a ford over a wadi (Wadi Mohammadi?) with water up to the hocks (end of March). From here for 2 m. track winds through a succession of knolls, numerous side gullies running back from the track and suitable for ambuscades. As one approaches Hit the smell of sulphur becomes noticeable, and a dirty - deposit of sulphur and bitumen forms on the ground. t 2292 LAND EOUTES Hit. Furnaces in which bitumen is melted and which emit dense clouds of smoke are passed close by. Brooks discoloured by minerals flow near the town. The track skirts a succession of walled date gardens -J- m. wide extending W. of the town along the bank of the river for nearly 1 m. Piles of limestone fragments are now passed, their yellow colour denoting the presence of sulphur. Track then crosses stony undulating desert. Salabiyeh. Track touches the river. Track now cuts off a bend of the river, crossing desert and three wadis. The road, which has lately been rocky and difficult in places, now descends from the high land into the valley and continues between the foot of the cliffs and cultivated land to Khan Baghdadiyeh. A khan was being built here in 1908. An authority (March 1908) reports that the Wadi Baghdadi is in this neighbourhood, and that it has steep banks and a mud bottom ; this is probably the wadi over which a substantial bridge has lately been built. Jibbeh. fort, small zaptidi post, near the river. The village is on an island f m. above Jibbeh fort. There is plenty of grass in April, and supplies may be got in small quantities from the neighbouring villages. Note .—Authority of 1909 gives the distances as follows :— Hit—Salahiyeh 5 m. Salahiyeh—Baghdadiyeh 19 m. Baghdadiyeh—Jibbeh 4 m. Between Jibbeh and Hadlseh a number of wadis are crossed : see under m. 146^ and 150^. The route at first strikes up on to high stony plain. Cross bed of Wadi Hanrau, which is usually dry, but subject to periodic floods of great violence. The bed is conglomerate slabs. One authority says that there is a possible route to Damascus in six days by following up this wadi and then proceeding W., but the lawlessness of the Anazeh has made it unsafe. Wadi er-Kajadan lies apparently beteen Wadi Hauran and Wadi Fadiyeh. Pass Alus village. Cross Wadi Padiyeh.ROUTE 46 298 Wadi Hajlau. All these wadis give grazing in spring; but they were found to be somewhat serious obstacles by a traveller (1908) passing over the route with two light wagons. Before reaching Hadlseh there is a cave in a cliff beside the road which will shelter a caravan of 100 animals. Hadiseh. A good place to camp on r. bank opposite the village. Supplies and grazing to be had. There is a bad khan. Note .—Authority, 1909, gives the following times between Jibbeh and Hadlseh (some of the intermediate points cannot be identified) :— Jibbeh—W. Hammam | hr. W. Hammarn—W, Abu'l Hasan 1| hr. W. Abu 1 ! Hasan—Altis % hr. Alus—W. Zughdan | hr. W. Zughdan—W. Fadiyeh 1 hr. W. Fadiyeh—W. Hajlan ^ hr. W. Hajlan—Hadlseh hr. From Hadlseh to Feheimeh is said to be better going than the previous stage. The track keeps on the plateau parallel with the river and about 1 m. from it for the first 8 m. There is said to be good camping-ground between Hadlseh and Feheimeh. Cross the Wadi Ausayiyeh. Feheimeh village and jzaptieh post. Swamp at mouth of wadi near post. A good deal of work is required on the stretch to Anah to make the road easy for wheeled traffic. There is abundance of stone, and labour in plenty can be obtained from Anah and the neighbouring villages. Road and T.L. leave river for high ground. The road is described by one authority as bad until it returns to the river. Hereabouts road and T.L. rejoin river and continue close _ to its bank as far as Anah. Anah becomes visible about this point; it extends some 6 m. along the river. Track descends to cross a water-course with a pebbled bed. There is a bridge here, in disrepair before the war. The Anah end was in 1907 much dilapidated, leaving a step 4 ft. high. Owing to this wheeled traffic had to cross 2^ m. up the torrent bed by another bridge. Before reaching Anah two new bridges over shallow but rocky gullies are crossed (1907).if 294 LAND EOUTES Mlies from Bag-hdad 1861 2051 212 216i 2311 2351 247^ Auah. After leaving N. gate of Anah and passing for 1 m. through gardens and fields, the road ascends to high ground apparently by the Wadi Rawa (authority 1889), leaving the river, which here makes an acute bend N. Eoad keeps mostly along the plateau, occasionally- descending to the river bank. It has been reported that in April 1896 a large grassy plain was reached at 1 m. from Nahiyeh, with good grazing, but no supplies or village. Another authority (early April 1907) speaks of a lack of grazing round Nahiyeh. Country is not so thickly populated as below Anah. ahiyeh khan and zaptieh post. Qasim el-'Assa iyeh. The road continues due W., leaving the river, which it again approaches at El-Qa'im. El-Q a'im, police post with two or three mptiehs normally. The post lies near the water's edge on a grassy plain which usually affords good grazing. There is neither village nor supplies. There is a very dirty khan. The country here is sparsely populated and villages are rare. The road now runs over low-lying ground through out, marshy in places and with brushwood near the river. The road keeps over the grass, avoiding the marshes (in flood time the river overflows its banks), and affords bad going to vehicles, the soil being soft sand and clay (1908). About half-way to Abu Kemal one passes from |he Vilayet of Baghdad to the of Aleppo. Several wadis are passed. Ruins of 'Anqah. (also called El-Jabriyeh from neighbouring shrine of Sheikh Jabir), and large mound covered with shapeless masses of stone. Cross large wadi called El-Jabir. Among the other wadis crossed between this point and Abu Kemal are several of large size, the most considerable being the Wadi c Ali. Abu Kemal. Road (hard sand) reported good for wheeled vehicles in March 1908. It runs through ploughland succeeded by sparse tamarisk jungle. Cross Wadi Sawab N. of Abu Kemal and strike NW. across a broad plain between river and desert plateau.ROUTE 46 295 Miles from Kuin -mound called Tel Madquq (60 ft. high), graves on the summit. A smaller Tel Madquq is a short distance nearer Abu Kemal. Tamarisk growth covers the plain to Salahiyeh. Salahiyeh khan and zaptieh post. In about | m. the road reaches foot of cliffs and continues to run beneath them. # At the extremity of a promontory of these cliffs, or about 1 hr. distant from Salahiyeh khan (one authority gives the distance as m.), are the remains of the Koman fortress of Salahiyeh, through which the road runs, having zigzagged up the otherwise inaccessible cliffs. The ascent begins with a masonry culvert forming a steep ramp constructed in 1906. The ruins comprise a gypsum wall some 15 ft. in height, running from one side of the promontory to the other (about ^ m.) with gate towers in the centre, 30-40 ft. in height. An inner wall at the NE. corner of the promontory marks the site of the citadel. Eoad keeps across high, stony ground for 9 m. ^ . . n Road now descends to and crosses a large plain. Ruins of Qalah Rahbeh on high ground can be seen for 12 m. This is a well-preserved castle on an abrupt rocky knoll 246 ft. above river-level. x The knoll is scarped away in places and faced with stone and brick. Ascent is very difficult. In the castle is a blocked well 60 ft. deep. Meyyadin. The road proceeds skirting what was till lately the river bed, now dry. It then lies mostly across a level plain, at first grassy. As Deir ez-Zor is approached the ground rises and is covered with wormwood. Large spring and summer camps of the Anazeh with flocks and herds, and many mares come for grazing on the Meyyadln Plain which extends W. some 25 m., terminating as the edge of the desert plateau sweeps round to the river again shortly before Deir ez-Zor. The plain is very fertile, and once was thickly peopled. It is still the most populated region between Birijik and Hilla. T.L. appears to run generally I-I tt m. W. of road.

From Deir to where they rejoin is 11 m. by the valley road and 12 m. by the upper road The valley road is about 20 ft. broad and ditched and metalled for some 10 m. A traveller (1909) in a 40-h.p Argyll car found no difficulty on this stretch of the route. Gully; bridge washed away (1907) by a torrent, i m. a bridge of three farther on is another gully with arches, central arch 12 ft. high. Eavine spanned by a single-arched bridge (26 ft. span). It is 20 ft. from the keystone to the torrent bed. The stone is brought from Ma'dan (two stages up-stream), and is durable against water and harder than the local stone. The road keeps to the valley, mostly over plains, grassy in spring, where numbers of bullocks and camels graze. Single-arched stone bridge hereabouts (1909). Track then proceeded across a muddy plain for 11 m., in the middle of which were 3 m. of earthwork raised 12 ft., for a chaussee, also two single-arched stone bridges.

This is said to be better supplied with water than the other. It crosses a rolling plain growing scanty, stunted barley, harvested in May. Villages of beehive-shaped huts, tents, and flocks are seen, and water is got from wells in the limestone, 2-3 ft. below the surface. Some of these wells are brackish. Tel Aghul, a beehive hut village of Haddidin Arabs. There are good water and grass here (May-June). The road now continues over stony soil, well cultivated.

This route has been little used, the caravan route by the r. bank being that regularly followed. There is no traffic whatever as far as Buseireh, and very little from Buseireh to Eaqqah ; but no serious difficulties for pack-animals are encountered, and as a rule it is possible either to follow the river or to strike across the river-bends, sometimes over the desert plateau. The neighbourhood of the mouth of the Belikh is marshy. The Khabur River is unfordable and there is at present no adequate ferry. Beyond Eaqqah there is a caravan-road, apparently little used, to the ferry at Meskeneh, but no evidence is available as to its condition. Water is always to be had from the river. On the first part of the journey, where there is irrigated cultivation, it is possible to water animals at the water-wheels. Beyond Raqqah there appears to be very little cultivation, and watering-places would have to be constructed. The country is thinly populated, and no supplies are to be obtained except at Deir and Eaqqah, and even there only for small parties. Pasture is good along the river in summer, and various tribes of nomads are to be met with at that season. (See Introduction to Routes IV E-H.) Transport animals might be procured from them. There are large areas at different parts of the route covered with tamarisk and thorn, which may be used for firewood except in spring. A good many of the distances given below must be regarded as uncertain. Compare Euphrates, Routes IV G, H, throughout. Miles from Anah 0 Anah. Cross the Euphrates by ferry to the 1. bank.

Ferry opposite Meskeneh.304 CONNEXIONS BETWEEN TIGEIS AND EUPHRATES VALLEYS ROUTE 48 ANAH—BAGHDAD A cross the D esert The desert between Baghdad and Anah was traversed (from Anah to Baghdad) in the autumn of 1908 by officials of the MacAndrew and Forbes Liquorice Co., who made the journey on horseback. Their object was to inspect the route with a view to a proposed motor-car service. The details given in (C) below are based on their information. In September 1909 the desert from Anah to Baghdad was crossed by a motor-car (see (A) below), and in November the return journey was made (see (B) below). Both (A) and (C) journeys were made via Helwat wells, but it is impossible to say exactly how far (A), (B), and (C) coincide. It was reported in 1908 that Sallh er-Kashid of the Suq Abu Leban on the r. bank of the Tigris at Baghdad knew this route, and had several men always passing over it. He used to run the camel overland post, and owned riding camels. He was to be found at the coffee shop of 'Ugeil. The route lies across level plain on slightly undulating ground, which would seem generally to afford good hard going, though in places tyres may be cut or punctured. Apparently in the region E. of Hit the desert is broken by wadis, which would give some trouble to vehicles. In the neighbourhood of Baghdad and near Lake Aqarquf the ground is liable to inundation in spring, and near Baghdad the going would be heavy after much rain. There are no permanent habitations in the desert, and no supplies can be counted on. Water very scarce, from a few wells (see (A) and (B) below).■« KOUTE 48 305 (A) Account of a journey by motor-car from Anah to Baghdad in September 1909. Water for the journey was carried from the Euphrates. About l-J days._ First day. Cross river at Anah. This was a matter of considerable difficulty, as piers had to be improvised. Leaving river proceed over stony ridges, which continue for an hour or more (but see (C), hrs. 0-11). Then traverse level plain of hard soil, and after 1 hr. of excellent going reach a well of bad water. Soon afterwards reach a strip of crystallized gypsum, which took 3 hrs. to cross: bad going. Then pebbly ground, generally good going, though soft in places. Reach Helwat wells, better water (compare (C), hr. 43£). Here halt was made for night. Second day. For about 80 m. from Helwat the ground is hard and level, with only occasional stretches of soft sand. Numerous herds of gazelle. Then reach nomad encampments, then dried marshland (Aqarquf?), which could only be taken slowly (compare (C), hr. 66J). Thence to Kazimain. (B) Baghdad—Anah by motor-car, November 28-29, 1909. Total running time, 22 hrs. First day. Very little difficulty: a good day's running. One puncture. Second day. In the first part of the day's run, many difficulties with wadis. Then excellent running till 3 p.m. The Wadi Tartar, which flows into a salt lake about 30 m. from Hit, was found to be in flood, and could not be crossed at the point where it was struck, owing to the bottom being of soft mud. An Arab showed the way to a crossing where the bottom was hard. The water was about 2 deep, and stones and branches of shrubs were placed in the river to assist the passage of the car. There was some difficulty in getting the car through, but in the end it was pulled out with the elp of some Arabs. On the other side of the Tartar the going was good for most of the way to Anah, but it was necessary to go slowly w some places lest the tyres should be cut by the small sharp s ones projecting through the ground. No difficulty in crossing the bef^ Anah, as shakhiurs and landing-piers had been prepared MES, III u L306 LAND EOUTES (C) Account of a ride from Anah to Baghdad, autumn 1908. See above. Total travelling time, 81| hrs. The times given below are said to be for travelling on horseback at moderate speed. Apparently this would make the total distance about 240 m. On the map the distance in a straight line from Baghdad to Hit is 160 m. The difference is perhaps accounted for by the necessity of going by wells, and by the Arab habit of marching not by compass but from landmark to landmark. But in view of the uncertainty as to rate of progress, &amp;c., no attempt has been made to give an estimate of the miles from point to point. Times are given in the margin. The places mentioned between the point opposite Anah and Kazimain are not villages, as these do not exist in this region. They are merely localities in the desert known to native guides.

Tel A'far, which is the residence of a Mudir, consists of about 3,000 stone houses. In 1906, the population had apparently been much depleted, the decline being due partly to recent attacks of the Shammar, partly to an epidemic of cholera some years previously. But a traveller who passed through the place in the winter of 1907-1908 estimated the population at several thousands. The inhabitants are mainly Turkish, with some Kurds. The Turkish inhabitants are indistinguishable in dress and appearance from the Arab fellahin, and many of them understand Arabic. There is cultivation to N. and S. of the town. Sufficient supplies for caravans are obtainable. Tel A'far is unwalled and stands on both sides of a stream, the water of which is slightly sulphurous. On a plateau overlooking the town from the E. is a building formerly used as a guard-house, and on the W. side is a hill several hundred feet high, on which are the ruins of a citadel called Qal'at Marwan.

From Tel A'far to Beled Sinjar the route is generally easy, running over open undulating ground or cultivated plain; but in January 1880 the going was soft, as the result of melting snow. Up to the Solaq Chai (21 m from Beled) the water on the route, though plentiful is brackish, and only just drinkable.

Half an hour farther on was another spring. ' In five and a half hours' a small stream near the ruins of an ancient village was reached. From here the dark line marking the wooded banks of the Khabur and the 'Abd el-'Aziz range beyond were visible at sunset. Two hours' ride from this point brought Layard to a Bedouin encamp ment, and after leaving it 'at length' (apparently not more than a few miles farther on) he reached the Khabur opposite Tel 'Araban.

This is the route followed by the camel-post which was discontinued in October 1912. It traverses the desert almost due W. to Dumeir. From the seventies of last century the post was in English hands, but Midhat Pasha was authorized by the Turkish Government in 1884 to establish a post to compete with the English one. This led to the latter being discontinued in the eighties, and therefore the Turkish post alone provided for a weekly exchange of letters between Baghdad and Damascus. Only ordinary letters, not articles of value, were taken. Each post rider, in addition to the animal on which he was mounted, had a reserve camel laden with water. The post-riders were almost exclusively c Ugeil. Passengers were not officially recognized, but sometimes accompanied the post at their own expense and risk. The post was discontinued owing to the frequent attacks326 LAND ROUTES by Bedouin, and post-bags were dispatched by a safer, if longer route by Aleppo. The journey over this route, always monotonous and sometimes dangerous, is extremely trying physically. It may require to be varied to avoid hostile Arabs, and it often happens that the usual wells are thus missed and the traveller left for three or four days without water. The camels march from 16 to 19 hours a day, and the halts are so arranged as never to allow a continuous rest of more than 2 or at the most 4 hours. Sometimes tempests of cold wind hinder the advance of the camels. In favourable circumstances and with good dromedaries the distance may be accomplished in about 7 days, but, as in any circumstances delay may occur, it is safer to calculate on the journey lasting from 9 to 10 days. The journey is shortest in the dry weather ; longer in winter and spring when the rains make the desert slipperv in places. The route leads over sandy or gravelly plains, hills or valleys, which are barren or produce only prickly shrubs and tall feathery grass which the camels eat. Over this region wander numerous tribes, the most important of which is the Anazeh. Sometimes a ghazm or plundering expedition of the Shammar or other wandering tribes may be encountered. There is most danger of these in winter, as w T ater can then be found in unfrequented spots, so that the marauders are not obliged to visit regular watering-places, always dangerous for them. In the centre of the desert there is scarcely any herbage for the greater part of the year, the plain being covered with black basalt, very trying for the feet of camels. Across the route a succession of wadis run NE. trending to E. Among these the Wadi Hauran, about one-third of the way between Hit and Damascus is important, as it is principally by means of it that this part of northern Arabia is drained towards the Euphrates some miles above Hit. The distances are very uncertain. Miles from Hit 0 Hit. lOf Kebeiseh village. Pop. 500 (1882). 50,000 palm trees (1911). Some commerce with the Bedouin in dates and other commodities.

This is a portion of the regular caravan route between Baghdad and Damascus, both goods and passenger traffic between these two places being fairly regular. Caravans cross each way every 40^ or 60 days. The present route occupies about 100 hours. According to a consular report of 1911 the Euphrates is left at Meyyadln, whence one goes direct to Blr Qabaqib; others, however, make Deir ez-Zor the point at which the river is left. The latter is accepted here as the beginning of the route. The caravan route across the desert consists of narrow footpaths worn by the feet of camels, and of these there may be a dozen or more at varying distances from one another. In the neighbourhood of brooks or settlements these paths may become hundreds in number. The route goes over the Hamad, the 6 hard stony desert' which extends from the Euphrates Valley and the mountains of Hauran in the N. to the oasis of El-Jauf in the S., crossing rather hilly country with numerous more or less independent parallel chains running from NE. to SW. Generally speaking, the Hamad sinks from W. to E. towards the Euphrates, and also occasionally inclines towards the S. as in the NE. part. These are accordingly the directions taken by the numerous wadis by which it is intersected. The water from these numerous slopes and wadis is gathered partly in natural pockets or depressions {radir), where it soon evaporates. Partly, how ever, it is collected in a few larger rain brooks, as in the Wadi Grharreh and the Wadi Hauran, which flow into the Euphrates, In winter and spring, during and after the rainy season, the steppe which constitutes a considerable part of the route has numerous Arab camps, and herds of gazelles may be seen. As the vegetation withers the Arabs draw nearer the cultivated districts and are followed by the gazelles, and the Hamad becomes a desert or desert- steppe in which water is only to be found in a few springs or in a few artificial cisterns or draw-wells. On account of the scarcity of water and the likelihood that marauding parties of Arabs may have been attracted to the few watering-places, the Hamad is seldom traversed by caravans in summer.rU 332 Miles from j Deir ez- | Zor o H 7^- ' 4 8 12 14| 22i 31i 42i 45 55i LAND EOUTES Deir ez-Zor.

Pools have formed in the neighbourhood of the wells, and in these the inhabi tants bathe ; in some of these there may be leeches. A town has existed here since ancient times but has dwindled owing to migrations to Aleppo, Homs, Hama, or Deir, and through the growing commercial importance of Deir, where most of the desert trade is now concen trated.

Kusafeh, formerly of great importance, is now ruined and almost abandoned owing to scarcity of water. There are no springs, and the subsoil water is 230 feet below the surface. It is now the head-quarters of the northern Anazeh. The chief ruins are those of a large building surrounded by a wall originally 25 ft. high which has hardly anywhere retained its original height. Outside is an earthen rampart 20 ft. from the wall. The W. side of the rampart has two towers. The outer wall of the ancient town, which, like a large part of the buildings inside, is built of stone blocks, was furnished with a chain of large and small towers interspersed (20 large, 9 small), those at the four corners round, the rest square. Inside is an arcade formed by the wall and a line of pillars which runs the whole length of the wall. Here and there are cross walls forming small cells. The outer wall is loopholed, and is on the whole well preserved, with the exception of a large breach on the E. side. The ground within the wall is higher than that outside. Within are ruins of churches and other buildings. In the SW. corner are six large cisterns, now dry. Track now runs WSW. over country level or intersected only by low hills.

Instead of the usual cisterns or wells there is a number of large stone basins which have served to collect rainwater. To S. are ruin-mounds, and there are similar ruins reported about 4 m. farther S. Anderin, the ancient Androna. Within a long rectangular wall, rounded at the corners, are the ruins of a few cisterns and churches. The most important are those of a basilica on the S.

General Description.—The town stands on an island about |m. long and ^ m. broad in the Lesser Zab. The direction of the river near here is from NE. by N. to SW. by S. The western channel is dry most of the year. In the h.w. season the water in the eastern channel may be 40 yds. broad and 10 or more ft. deep, but when the spring floods are over this branch becomes fordable above and below, but not at the town. It is crossed by a bridge of a single 60-ft. span, about 50 ft. above h. w. level, with some minor arches in the abutments. Owing to its steepness this bridge is difficult of ascent from both sides. The western channel is crossed by another bridge of 3 arches of about 20-ft. span each. It is less steep, but has a turn or elbow in the middle. It has a toll-station. The walls of the outer houses of the town are built in continuation of a low cliff-face giving the appearance of fortifications. One long street runs through the town from the bridge. The T.O. is near the eastern end; then come the barracks, which are only occasionally occupied, and towards the western end a small bazaar.ALTUN KOPEti—ANAH 351 On the E. side of the eastern branch is a suburb called Mahalleh Sulani, consisting of about 70 houses of Arabs, Kurds, and others. On the W. side of the western branch there is another suburb called Mahalleh Tis'in, of about the same size, of mixed population. On the r. bank of the river nearly due S. of the bridge and a little below the junction of the two arms is a small mixed Turkish and Arab hamlet called Kazabashi. Supplies and Commerce. —There are about 50 shops. Trade is mostly in wheat and barley, which are exported and floated down the Tigris on rafts. There is a small export of wool and timber brought by river from the hills. Drinking-water is obtained from the river. Inhabitants. —The inhabitants are mostly Turkomans, and there are also some Arabs and Kurds. They are reported to be not very well disposed to the Osmanlis. Turkish is the prevailing language.

Anah comes next in importance to Deir ez-Zor among the towns between Aleppo and Baghdad. It lies among paltn trees, and is a long, straggling town, consisting practically of a single street which extends for some 4-5 m. along the Baghdad—Aleppo caravan route. The road in the town crosses numerous water-channels by bridges that are rough for traffic. The houses are interspersed among gardens and date groves. The town has three mosques. On an eminence to N. of the town, close to the Euphrates, is a ruined castellated building, formerly a fort, built in the first half of the last century, to command the river approaches. The island of Ardeshlr or Lubbad and other352 GAZETTEEE OF TOWNS islands in the river opposite Anah are cultivated and contain palm trees. On the I. bank opposite the upper end of Anah is Rawa village with fruit-gardens and date groves. On the hill above are modern barracks (apparently defensible) called Qasr el-Za'im. Supplies and Commerce. —Before the present war all necessary supplies for a caravan could be obtained here. In the region of Anah wheat and barley are cultivated, but there does not seem to have been in recent years any appreciable surplus for export. Dates apricots, plums, figs, pomegranates, &amp;c., are produced in the gardens of the towns. The live stock of the consists mainly of sheep. Water is to be obtained from wells, and also from the river. Wool, butter, and dates were exported to Aleppo. Grain, soap, honey, and spices came down the Euphrates from Birijik. It was reported in 1911 that merchandise from Aleppo for Mosul was sometimes sent down the Euphrates by to Rawa opposite Anah, and thence conveyed by camel to Mosul. Arab cloaks are manufactured here. It was estimated in 1909 (with regard to a projected railway) that 7,000 men and 8,000 women would be available in the district for labour. Inhabitants. —The people of Anah are mostly Sunni Arabs. A few Jews live in the southern end of the town. The boatmen of Anah are famous for their knowledge of the Euphrates.

General Description. —The village stands partly on a steep col, connecting an outer and lower hill called Giri with a higher one on which is a prehistoric fort, and partly in two valleys which come down from the hills. These are called Gali Kanyarash and Gali Sheikh 'Abdul Aziz, and lie respectively E. and W. of Giri and the fort, uniting below Giri to form the Rudbar Samileh, which is said to reach the Zab at Zairao below Garmak.ANAH—AQREH—BAGHDAD—DEIR EZ-ZOR 353 The Jewish quarter is on the 1. bank of the western Gali, the Christian on the E. hank of the eastern. Supplies and Commerce. —The town is supplied with water from some large springs, and there are streams in the neighbourhood. Some rice and tobacco are grown for local consumption. Inhabitants. —The population is mainly Kurdish (another earlier account says Jewish), with 50 houses of Chaldaean Catholics, 10 of Jacobites, and about 20 of Jews. The Christian section of the popula tion are blacksmiths, joiners, and artisans, and the Jews traders and weavers. Administration and Authorities. — The place is the seat of a Kaim- makam under Mosul. In 1910 the Kaimmakam was Ali Niyazi Bey, a native of Syria, and in May of that year an Anatolian battalion was in garrison here. The chief Kurd in the hilly districts to the E. in 1904 was Hasan Agha, chief of the Zebari tribe. BAGHDAD.

The town stands on rising ground above the river opposite an island. It is said to be comparatively European in appearance, having macadamized roads, public gardens, and street-lamps. It has one fairly broad straight street in which are the bazaar, three khans, and the government buildings. There were two Turkish barracks, and a civil and a military hospital here before the war. There is said to be good camping-ground W. of the town. Supplies and Commerce. —In peace time all necessary supplies for caravans (including sheep, grain, fruit, and vegetables) could be purchased at Deir, but these seem to have been largely imported from other districts. It was stated in 1903 that there was no grain available for export grown in the country between Deir and Sabkhah. About 5,500 tons were imported from Birijik and about 1,600 tons from Najib and Sheikh Arud. Vegetables and fruit were also imported. Cultivation, however, has recently been increasing in the neighbourhood. Sheep and other live stock might be obtained from nomads in neighbourhood. Good blood-horses. Water-supply from wells and river. Deir is now a prosperous town, having revived with the increase of security in the Euphrates Valley. It is a meeting-place of trade routes: here the direct route from Damascus or Homs to Mosul crosses the Baghdad—Aleppo caravan route. The route Aleppo—Deir—Mosul has lately been more and more frequented. Here too the down-stream river-traffic from Birijik has its entrepot, the merchants of Deir buying up the cargoes of the Birijik boats and re-exporting them to places further down the river. It was stated in 1903 that 150 boats annually left Deir for towns down stream. They mainly carried grain (about 700 tons). The same boatmen are not accustomed to navigate the river above and below Deir. There was a horse-market here in which good thoroughbreds were bought and sold. Manchester cottons, tinned food, fresh pro visions, &amp;c., were found in the bazaar before the war. Inhabitants. —These are mostly town Arabs (Sunnis), and are said to be a very low class. There is a colony of Christians, mainly Syrian Catholics (Jacobite Uniates). There also are some Jews, some Armenians, and a Circassian settlement NW. of the town. A large number of deported Armenians were kept here in 1915. It was said that they were to be made to work on (he Baghdad road. Administration and Authorities. —Deir is the head-quarters of the Deir ez-Zor Mutessariflik, and is under the administration of the Mutessarif. In peace time there was a garrison here of one battalion of infantry and some mounted infantry on mules.f 1^6 DEIK EZ-ZOE—EKBIL 355 EBBIL, about 48 m. E. by S. of Mosul.

General Description. —Erbil (Assyrian 'Aba-Ilu, ' Four Gods') was a great Assyrian city, being especially famous for its cult of the goddess Ishtar, and under Persian rule it continued to be a considerable place, and its temple of Ishtar was still famous. Alexander won the decisive battle that made him master of the Persian Empire some where in the plain to the SW. of Erbil near the Great Zab in b . c. 831. Later Erbil was the burial-place of the Parthian kings. Its sanctity disappeared with the rise of Christianity, and since the Mohammedan conquest its history has not been of general importance, though its position as a road centre in a fertile district has ensured its continued existence. The battle which transferred the Caliphate from the Omayyad to the Abbasid family was fought in the neighbour hood about the middle of the eighth century. The modern town of Erbil stands partly on a large artificial mound of Assyrian origin, which rises 200 ft. above the plain with a slope of 1 in 1. The mound is 600 yds. in diameter. It is surrounded by a ring wall, against which houses have been built on the inside, with windows pierced through to the outer face. Inside, on the summit of the hill, there are many winding streets, some being only 4-6 ft. wide and very intricate. There are only two gates, both on the SW., with camps leading up to them. Below the mound a large quarter (said to be growing) has sprung up to the W. and S. The khan, baths, posting-station, and telegraph office are at the foot of the hill on the W. side. On the NW. side is a one-storied block of mud barracks. On the N. and E. sides of the citadel are the remains of a wall of mud 4 ft. thick which would still make a good parapet. The stony bed of the Erbil Eiver (usually dry) lies about 1 m. SE. of the town, and 1^ m. iflthe same direction is Badowa, a village of 50houses of Dizeih Kurds. WdW . from the mound, just outside the town, is an old minaret. Supplies and Commerce. —The of Erbil produces large quantities of wheat and barley, with a considerable surplus for export to Baghdad via the Tigris. There is much corn-land in z 2356 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS the plain and undulating country which surrounds the town and in the district of Shemamlik to the SSW. Some rice is also grown in the neighbourhood. In the hills to ENE., supplies of fruit, vegetables, and firewood can be obtained among the Kurdish tribes, who bring them into Erbil for sale. The capacities of Erbil as a supply centre are increased by its position at the meeting-point of numerous routes. In October most of the streams are dry, but abundant water can be obtained from karez and wells. There is a large karez, led first through an open brick duct 3 ft. above the ground and 4 ft. broad, where animals are watered, and then into a large masonry tank and other channels. It is excellent water if taken where it enters the duct, but becomes contaminated lower down. Water is carried to the upper town on skins slung on ponies and donkeys. The neighbouring tribes bring wool and hides to sell in Erbil, and articles are locally manufactured from these raw products. There is much transit commerce of goods passing between the Kurdish and Persian hills and Mesopotamia. Inhabitants. —The population is mainly Kurdish, of the Babari tribe. Their language is a variation of the Mukri dialect. There is also a certain Turkoman element, and Turkoman is understood. Administration and Authorities. —The place is the head-quarters of a Kaza under Kirkuk Sanjaq. The land-taxes are said to produce £T90,000 a year, of which one-third comes from land owned by the Dd'irat es-Saniyeh. In peace time the garrison consisted of one battalion. HIT, on the r. bank of the Euphrates, 79^ m. by river above Eellujeh, and 119-| m. below Anah. Pop. estimated (1909) at 1,600. Houses estimated at 600. P.O., T. (Baghdad—Aleppo line). River Routes. —For communication by the Euphrates see IV E, F. Land Routes— (i) Baghdad—Aleppo caravan road passes through Hit. (See Boute 46.) (ii) To Damascus across the desert. (See 52.) (iii) To Mosul across the desert. No details available. General Description. —Hit is a small walled town with two gates, built of field stones plastered with mud. It stands upon a mound on the river-bank which is precipitous to the plain, and slopes lessERBIL—HIT—KHANIKIN 05) 357 steeply to the river. A tall leaning minaret near the river-bank is a conspicuous landmark for miles. At the S. end of Hit are boat building yards. There is a khan below the town. In the neighbour hood of the mound on which the modern town stands are other, somewhat lower, eminences which mark the sites of former settle ments. To N. and S. are palm groves. To W. near some are the chief bitumen springs, and beyond them a barren desolate plain of sand, clay, and black-seamed rocks. There is a ferry at N. end of the town. The Mesopotamian plain on the other side of the river is here quite flat; a little farther down-stream it contains naphtha springs, and beyond these salt lakes. The atmosphere of Hit is smoky owing to the burning bitumen kilns, and the furnaces of the boat-building yards. A strong smell of sulphur (from neigh bouring sulphur springs) and of boiling bitumen pervades the air ; it is said to have saved Hit from a cholera epidemic. The ground round Hit is very dirty, owing to the bitumen and sulphur. Supplies and Commerce. —No appreciable amount of supplies for troops can be expected at Hit. The cultivated area near the town is a very narrow strip, which does not produce a surplus for export. Hit owes its existence to the bitumen springs around it, which are said to have been worked here for 5,000 years. The bitumen has a sale in Mesopotamia for caulking boats, binding bricks, &amp;c. Boat building is an important occupation. The boats are made with branches of tamarisk and mulberry trees interlaced with basket- work of reeds and straw, the whole covered with bitumen and sand. They draw 22 in. when laden, and 6 in. when empty. They are exported to other places in Irak. Earthen pottery is also made at Hit. Inhabitants. —The population consists of Sunni Arabs. Administration. —Hit before the war was the head-quarters of a Kaza and the seat of a Kaimmakam. KHANIKIN, 94 m. NE. of Baghdad and 6-| m. from the Persian frontier. Pop. 5,000 (1911). P.O., T. Bridge over the Alvand. Routes— (i) To Baghdad. (See 28 a.) (ii) To Kirmanshah. (See 28 ft.) (iii) To Mandali. (See 29.) (iv) To Salahiyeb. (Kufri). (See 32 a, b.) General Description. — The town lies among gardens on both banks of a tributary of the Diyaleh, the rapid Alvand stream, which358 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS is spanned by a solid brick and stone bridge, with roadway of 25 ft. This bridge was constructed at the expense of the Persian Govern ment to facilitate the weekly postal service between Turkey and Persia. The river here is 60 yds. wide, and fordable. The town lies mainly E. of it. There are some well-built houses in the main streets. The place owes its importance to its position so near the frontier, and on the Shiah pilgrim-route from Persia to Kerbela and Nejef. The Baghdad Railway Company before the war had taken up the scheme, for which a native company had previously secured a concession, of building a branch line from Baghdad to Khanikin. There are several khans. Climate and Hygiene. — Khanikin is the quarantine station on the Turkish side of the frontier. A report of 1894 states that there is here, as at most of the frontier towns, a European health officer. The altitude of the town is about 1,000 ft. above sea-level, and no extreme of cold is ever felt. Supplies and Commerce. —Water is abundant, and supplies are said to be plentiful, but few details are given. The gardens are famed throughout the Baghdad V for the excellence of their fruits, which include dates, pomegranate, figs, and lemons. Barley and wheat are the chief agricultural products. Inhabitants. —The inhabitants are mainly Kurds and Lurs, with some Turks, Arabs, Jews, and Persians. Administration. —Khanikin is the head-quarters of a Kaimmakam in the Baghdad Vilayet. KIRKUK, on the main route Baghdad—Mosul, 187^ m. N. of Baghdad. Pop. variously estimated at from 15,000 to 50,000. Probably 20,000 is fairly near the number (4,000 houses). P.O., T. Brick bridge of 15 arches across the Hasa Su from Kirkuk to Qarveit Mahalleh. Routes— (i) Main Baghdad—Mosul road. (See 25 a, m 187^.) (ii) To Suleimauiyeli. (See 37.) (iii) To Koi Sanjaq. (See 25 a, m. 187^, and under m. 198^-.) (iv) To Taktak. (See Boute 40, under m. 32.) General Description. —The town lies on the 1. bank of the Hasa Su, with the suburb of Qarveit Mahalleh. opposite it at the W. end of the bridge. In this suburb are the military barracks, military hospital, post and telegraph office, a school, and the residences ofKHANIKIN—KIRKUK 359 many officials. On the W., N., and NE. the low hills stand close round the town, hiding it from view in these directions until one is near it. At the northern end the citadel stands on a large flat-topped mound, 130 ft. in height, with the quarter near the Mosque of 'Ali at its base. The Chaldaean community has a new cathedral built by the French Roman Catholic mission. The town contains two arched bazaars and several khans, as well as public baths which are reported to be very bad. Owing to the sheltered position of the town, the climate is excessively hot and not very healthy in summer. Supplies and Commerce. —The town is said to contain apparently about 500 shops, but the local authorities claim that there are upwards of 1,800. Wheat, barley, a little rice, beans, melons,* cucumbers, and a few grapes are grown in the country round Kirkuk. There are several flour-mills on the bank of the river. The inhabi tants were reported in 1903 to own 30,000 sheep in the pastures near the town ; but the live stock of the district may have been diminished owing to the constant raids of the Hamawaud between the years 1906 and 1909. Water can be obtained after rain or the melting of the snow from the Hasa Su, but there is generally little or no water in the river bed, and most of the rather scanty supply comes from wells. There are oil springs at Baba Gurgur, 5 m. N W. of the town. Kirkuk is a centre for the purchase of Arab horses, which are exported. Some cotton is grown in this region, and the chief exports of the place are oil, wool, gall-nuts, wheat, barley, fruit, gum, and a little wine. The chief occupation is that of drapers and mercers, and the chief imports are cotton goods, Kirkuk being a distributing centre for Kurdistan. Fruit trees include the vine, lime, olive, fig, apricot, and mulberry. Inhabitants. —The inhabitants are of many races and religions. The principal are Turkoman, Kurd, and Arab. There are also Armenians, Chaldaeans, Syrians, and numerous Jews, who are said to own 200 houses out of 4,000. An equal number of houses is said to be inhabited by the Christians of various sects. Arabic and Kurdish are spoken indifferently in the bazaars, and Turkish is understood by most. The town itself has been strongly held by the Turkish Government, which has maintained fair order within the walls. The Sunni element is probably considerably stronger than the Shiah. There is said to be a fanatical population in the quarter round the Mosque of 'Ali to the N. of the town ; but the Moslems of Kirkuk have been given a good character for honesty and generosity, at any360 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS rate in their dealings among themselves. They are said to be more interested in local than imperial politics. Administration and Authorities. —Kirkuk and the surrounding country is administered by Mutessarif under the Vali of Mosul. In peace time it was the head-quarters of the 12th Division of the 6th (Baghdad) Corps. The ordinary garrison was a battalion of infantry and a large detachment of infantry mounted on mules. There is a Persian Consul (in 1909 a Kirmanshah Kurd). History. —Kirkuk, in recent years an important Turkish ad ministrative centre, is an ancient city. It is fairly certain that the town goes back far beyond Seleucid times, though nothing seems to be known about its early history. « Three tombs shown to visitors are said to be those of Daniel, Shadrach, and Meshech, and there was also one, now lost, of Abednego. The place was one of the most important sees of the Eastern Church, and figures largely in its martyrology. Outside the town is a mound called Tamazgerd which was generally the scene of martyrdom. It was acquired after the great persecution of Shapur II in the fourth century, and takes its name from Tamazgerd, the stimulator of the persecution in the reign of Yezdigird I, who is said to have turned Christian at the sight of the endurance of the martyrs. About 100 years ago the place was devastated by plague, which carried olf most of the educated community and consequently destroyed many local traditions. KOI SANJAQ, about T 90 m. ESE. of Mosul, between Erbil and the Persian frontier. 1,200 houses. T.L, Routes— (i) To Erbil. (See Boute 42.) (ii) To Kaniyeb.. (See Route 40.) (iii) To Snleimaniyeh.. (See 39.) (iv) To Rowanduz. (See Bo 44 b.) General Description, —The town lies in a kind of basin about 3 m. across, bounded on N. and E. by low hills. On the N. is a knoll with a ruined masonry fort 250 yds. square with towers at the corners. A report of 1904 states that it was used as a barracks. The town is less squalid thain Suleimaniyeh, and has a few^good houses. There are good places for camping in the neighbourhood. Supplies and Commerce. —There is good water from a large stream and springs to the N. Corn and tobacco are exported down theKIRKUK—KOI SANJAQ—MOSUL 361 Lesser Zab and Tigris to Baghdad. Pomegranates, apricots, figs, mulberries, melons, cherries, and vines are cultivated, but, according to an authority of 1904, without much knowledge of horticulture. Cucumbers and other vegetables are also grown. Firewood could be had from the wooded ridges to N. and E. There is no information as to forage, but it is probably fairly plentiful. Inhabitants. —The population are Kurds, with 50 Jewish and 30 Chaldaean houses. The prevailing language is Kurdish, but Arabic is generally understood. Turkish is spoken only by officials and educated people. An authority of 1904 speaks of the local Kurds as being neither interesting nor attractive, without intelligence or manners. Administration and Authorities. —The place is the residence of a Kaimmakam. There is no evidence as to the size of the garrison. MOSUL, on the r. bank of the Tigris, some 230 m.

(See vol. iv. 67 a, b.) General Description. —Mosul stands on the W. side of the Tigris trough and is bounded on the E. by the river. To the W. of the city the country consists of rocky formations, rising in gentle undulations out of the plain. In the immediate vicinity these formations consist of solid beds of compact, granular gypsum, m horizontal strata and non-fossiliferous. This rock is extensively quarried as ' Mosul marble and varies in colour from pure white to bluish grey. Superimposed on the gypsum is a layer of coarse362 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS friable limestone, abounding in shells. This layer is thin to the W., but much thicker to the S. of the city, where it is extensively quarried for building purposes. The Tigris at Mosul cuts into the side of its trough and threatens some of the buildings of the town. The whole river-bed, covered in high flood, is about 675 yds. broad, and there is a deep channel on the W. of about 150-200 yds. The bridge of boats crosses the river from a pier 32 yds. long opposite the Bab el-Jisr Gate (in the southern half of the river-front) to a gravelly bank which is sub merged when the Tigris is in flood. The boat-bridge is 125 yds. long, and has a roadway of rough planking 24 ft. wide, which is laid on 17 pontoons, flat-bottomed boats 26 ft. long by 10 ft. wide, with a waterway 10 ft. between each and its neighbour. The gravelly bank on the E. side of the river is crossed by a bridge of brick faced with sandstone, which is laid at an angle of about 45° to the boat-bridge. The masonry bridge is approached from the pontoon-bridge by a ramp 46 yds. long, and has a total length of 278 yds. : the roadway, which is 16 ft. wide, is laid on 29 arches, each of 20 ft. span, and at the eastern end there is a ramp 52 yds. long. Beyond the E. end of the masonry bridge the road may be under water for as much as 150 yds. in the flood season. In high flood the boat-bridge is removed, and the river is then crossed by boats. These boats (of which about 30 used to be available) are each about 24 ft. long by 8 ft. wide. They are punt-shaped, with the stern cut down to allow animals to go on board. Each boat can take 6 laden mules. The boat-bridge may be expected to be in position from some time in the early part of June to the end of March. The town of Mosul, though dusty, glaring, and treeless, is not unpicturesque at a distance, the outline of the walls being broken by numerous domes, minarets, and towers. The city is partially surrounded by badly-built rubble walls, 15-20 ft. high, with a thick ness of about 6 ft. at the bottom and 3 ft, at the top. These were constructed at the beginning of the last century as a protection against Bedouin raids, and are now out of repair. In many places they have already been breached, and the ditch has been filled in. There are 11 gates. On the river side, houses have been built into the wall, and their windows look out on to the river. To the N. and W. there is an expanse of waste land between the houses and the walls. To the S., beyond the Bab es-Serai, the river is fringed with mud houses inhabited by raftsmen, boatmen, and fishermen. Behind these houses is a broad road planted with trees, and E. of this is a broad open space used partly as the drill-ground of theMOSUL 363 garrison, and partly, apparently, as a cattle market. At the end of the road, about f m. from the city gate, are the barracks and Government offices, and the residences of the Vali and other officials. The post and telegraph offices lie on the road somewhat nearer to the town. The streets of Mosul are narrow, undrained lanes, winding between blank house walls. A few of the streets are paved with stones, which make very slippery going. The houses are built of sun-dried bricks or of stone (' Mosul marble ') set in gypsum cement. Little wood is used in their construction. The larger houses are built round a courtyard, into which the rooms and a hall open. They usually have serdahs, or underground rooms, for use in the hot weather. The number of houses has been estimated at 12,000. There are numerous mosques and several large khans. The bazaars are held in booths in the streets. About the middle of the river front, not far above the bridge, is an old citadel. The church of the French Dominican Mission is marked on a plan of 1873 as slightly W. of the centre of the town. Mosul is not an attractive place; it is insanitary and dirty, with a bad climate and smoky atmosphere. The smoke comes from the gypsum kilns. The most unpleasant quarter appears to be a cluster of some 300 houses near the river, which serves as abattoir, tannery, and dye-works for the whole town. In 1906 it was stated that the Government had twice endeavoured to abolish this quarter, but on both occasions the attempt had provoked a riot. Climate and Hygiene. —The climate of Mosul is very trying in the summer. The worst part of the hot weather is from July to September, when the thermometer may go as high as 120° F. in the day, and not fall below 95° at night. Hot winds blow in from the desert. Even in May a temperature of 100° may be looked for, and the cool season does not begin till November. In the cool weather, which is also the rainy season, the nights are often frosty. (See chapter on Climate, vol. i, and accompanying tables.) Owing to the glare and the dust, the amount of which is appreciably increased by the numerous kilns and pounding mills in which gypsum is worked, ophthalmia is common, and tuberculosis is said to be terribly prevalent'. Cholera, on the other hand, is not common, though its existence has been suspected. Visitations of plague are reported. Mosul has its 1 boilfrom which few who reside there long escape ; it is said to be not distinguishable from the Baghdad date-mark'. Almost all travellers comment on the filthy and insanitary conditions of the place; which, in the opinion of one observer, call for the abandonment of the site and the building364 GAZETTEEK OF TOWNS of a new town on another site. Sulphur springs, some of them hot, are found near the Tigris both above and below Mosul (e .g. at Hammam 'Ali, see Route III E, m. 167|). and are much resorted to for medicinal purposes. A hot eddying wind—the Sam —which blows in the desert W. of the city, is said occasionally to affect fatally those who are exposed to it. It is sometimes possible to avoid its worst effects by lying on the ground. Supplies and Commerce. —In spite of its arid appearance much of the country from which Mosul is supplied is fertile, and agriculture has on the whole been developing during the past twenty or thirty years. There are said to be about 200 flour-mills in the city. In normal times the bazaars of the town are well stocked with grain, fruit, and meat. The principal crops of the Mosul country are wheat and barley, which ripen in April, and among the minor produce may be mentioned lentils, peas, beans, millet, maize, cucumbers, as well as many fruits—melon, orange, fig, plum, pear, and grape. The date palm grows, but does not fruit freely. Sheep and goats were numerous before the present war. The water-supply is not satisfactory; there are numerous wells, but they are brackish ; and the people rely for their drinking supplies on the Tigris, from which the water is brought on ponies in skins. The Tigris water is considered good except when the river is low. Schemes for a municipal water-supply have been talked of for years, but nothing has been done. There is much excellent spring grazing near Mosul. Wood for fuel seems scarcely to be found in the neighbourhood of the city. In normal times timber is brought from the Kurdish hills. Mosul would make a good centre for the collection of transport animals of all kinds. In peace time numerous donkeys, mules, horses, and camels could be obtained here. In the Middle Ages Mosul was an important entrepot and manu facturing centre, and 'was celebrated for its jewellery, arms, and carpets, as well as for cotton and silk and embroidered fabrics (the word ' muslin' is said to be derived from the name of the town). Misrule, insecurity of transport, the introduction of cheap machine- made goods, and the diversion of trade by the Suez Canal have in various ways affected its prosperity, but there are still a considerable number of gold and silversmiths, of workers in iron and copper, of shoemakers, and above all of weavers; and only security is required to increase very largely its commercial importance. Mosul is a distributing centre for European goods imported through Aleppo, and for Indian goods which come through Baghdad; and to it areMOSUL 365 brought for re-export the abundant raw products and the textile fabrics of Kurdistan and NW. Persia. The following statistics (giving value in sterling) for 1912 show that before the war trade was still on a fairly extensive scale : Imports. Exports. £ £ United Kingdom . . . 51,000 163,000 India 41,000 22,000 Other foreign countries . 56,000 53,000 Total 148,000 238,000 Other parts of Turkey . . 30,000 188,000 Grand total 178,000 426,000 The chief articles of import were cotton piece-goods, and yarn, and the demand was increasing in spite of the superior durability of locally woven articles. Iron and copper were always in large demand, Swedish iron being much used. From France came tanned leather and cigarette papers, from Austria broadcloths, from India cotton goods, coffee, and gunnies, from Persia carpets. Petroleum was also imported. The imports from other parts of Turkey included piece-goods, soap (from Aleppo), dates (from Baghdad), dried fruits, peas, and nuts. The main exports to other countries were wool, hides and skins, boots and shoes ; and to other parts of Turkey wheat, sheep and cattle, galls, hides, and fruits. In favourable seasons exports of wheat were on a very large scale; in 1908 their value amounted to £200,000. There is a large local production of flour, the number of mills being not less than 200, and there is a good opening for the intro duction of Western methods of milling. About 40 m. from Mosul, near the bank of the Tigris, are the Kaiyara naphtha springs, which yield a thick black product. In 1908 the right of exploitation was leased to a native of Erbil, who sold the refined product at his own village at 9 to 15 piastres for 4 gallons. Inhabitants. —The population was estimated about 1904 at 40,000- 50,000, but more recent calculations raise it to double the former figure. Fully three-quarters of the people are Mohammedans, and practically all of these are Sunnis. The Mosulis are a race of mixed origin, their language being Arabic. They have a bad reputation for turbulence, cruelty, and viciousness. In normal times there is a considerable floating population of Arabs and Kurds. The Christians (perhaps about 16,000) are chiefly Syriac speaking, and belong to various sects—the Chaldaeans, West Syrian Catholics, and Jacobites are all represented; there are also some Nestorians.366 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS There is a large and important French Dominican Mission in Mosul, and at the Dominican mission-school many of the Chaldaeans and West Syrian Catholics have learnt to speak French. There are also a few native Protestants, the converts of an American mission; some of these probably speak English. The strong Jewish colony lives in a quarter of its own. Administration and Authorities. — The municipal administration before the war was in the hands of the Vali of the province and a council of notables. This council has a particularly evil fame for corruption and intrigue. Its members are wealthy merchants and landowners, some of the latter being descended from the Arab oligarchy which ruled Mosul in the eighteenth century. So far as they could not make the Turkish officials their tools, they were generally in more or less concealed opposition to the Vali's ad ministration. For the furtherance of their ends they used their money and influence among the lower classes of the city, and they have been known covertly to instigate violent outbreaks of riot. The Chaldaean Christians have a patriarch in Mosul; the West Syrian Catholics and Jacobites have their respective bishops. There was also before the war a Papal Legate with supervisory powers over the Uniate churches of the country. In 1914 there was a French consul at Mosul, and also British, Russian, and German vice-consuls. History. —On the 1. side of the Tigris, opposite the present city of Mosul, are the extensive ruin-mounds which mark the site of Nineveh. After the fall of Nineveh and of the whole Assyrian State in 604 B.C., no considerable city appears to have existed in the neighbourhood for many centuries. Under the Mohammedan Caliphate Mosul rose to importance as a centre of commerce and manufacture, and in the decay of the Abbasid's power it became the capital of an independent kingdom under an Arab dynasty. In the eleventh century it was ruled by a dynasty of Seljuk Turks— the Atabegs. It was sacked by the Mongol invaders of the thirteenth century, and at the end of the fourteenth was for some time the head-quarters of Timur Lang. The Persians conquered it early in the sixteenth century, but in 1516 it was won by the Turkish Sultan Selim. It was placed under the Pasha of Baghdad. The Turkish hold on the city was for long w r eak, and in the eighteenth century the city was practically ruled by an oligarchy of local notables. In the nineteenth century Turkish authority was revived, and in 1878 Mosul became the capital of a separate which was carved out of the Pashalik of Baghdad. lilloKo flloSt aloBa '0131MOSUL—RANIYEH—EAQQAH 367 BANIYEH, about ^ 100 m.

General Description. —The Arab settlement lies about 1 m. from the river in the SW. corner of a large semi-circular enclosure, formed by an old brick wall with round bastions at intervals. In the middle of the enclosure are the remains of a mosque. To the west of the368 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS Arab village, outside the enclosure and standing on high broken ground, is a Circassian colony. To the east of the enclosure con taining the Arab village is another ruin-field with a minaret rising from its centre. Supplies and Commerce. —There is a good deal of cultivation in the neighbourhood. The settlement has a bazaar, and is much used as a market by the surrounding Arabs. Inhabitants. —Arabs and Circassians. Administration. —Raqqah is the head-quarters of a Kaza in the Vilayet of Aleppo and is the seat of a Kaimmakam. History. —Eaqqah occupied the site of the ancient cities of Nice- phorium and Calllnicum. The later town, Callinicum, was a strong fortress and important market on the frontier of the Roman Empire. It flourished under the early Caliphs (Harun er-Rashld had a palace here), but by the fourteenth century it was a mere ruin-field, the city having probably been destroyed by the Mongols. About 40 years ago the site was nearly unoccupied, but the place has been growing in size and importance during the last few years. BOWANDUZ, about v 80 m.

(See vol. iv, 62 a.)RAQQAH—KOWANDUZ 369 General Description. —The town is remarkably situated on a sloping tongue of land, very abrupt in parts, which runs down to the canon of the Kowanduz Chai; this tongue is separated from the country eastwards by the Kalund, a great gully with precipitous sides which joins the Rowanduz Chai just above the town. An easy track, by which the narrow streets of the town can be avoided, leads from the S. end of the gorge to the Persian route in the river valley J m. E, of the town. At the top of the town is a suburb called Qalah Teluk on a plateau among gardens. It contains the house of Sa'id Bey, villas of Turkish officers, and the summer residences of some of the in habitants. The town itself is long, steep, and straggling, and is in two parts, of which the upper is the larger. Between the two parts is a tract less steep than the rest, with the summer quarters of the Kaimmakam and the palace of Abdullah Pasha. The T.O. and winter are in the lower town. The streets are narrow, and the houses are built across them in some places, while in others the road goes over the roof. To make a wheel road some of the houses would have to be levelled. Sanitation is quite unknown. A stream flows through the town. Below the lower town the Kowanduz Chai is crossed at a deep and narrow gorge by a wooden bridge of 18 ft. span without parapets. The Kalund gorge is crossed by a similar wooden bridge of 20 ft. span. Both are passable for mules but not for guns. About 1,500 yds. to the N. the town is commanded by an old Kurd blockhouse, and at a short distance are the insignificant ruins of a castle on a yellow, bluff, steep-sided knoll. They were con structed about eighty years ago by Mohammed Pasha. (See below : Administration and Authorities.) To SE. is the Beni Hindawln, a steep ridge rising to about 8,000 ft., wooded near the summit. Supplies and Commerce. —There is little evidence as to supplies. Water seems to be plentiful, and a little wine is made, but practically none is exported. Grapes may be had either fresh or dried. Trade is mostly in gall-nuts, wool, and goat's hair. Inhabitants. —The inhabitants are mostly Kurds. There are about 40 households of Jews and about a dozen Christians who have come for trade, unaccompanied by their families. Administration and Authorities. —Eowanduz is the seat of a Kaim makam in the Kirkuk Sanjaq of the of Mosul. In 1910 the Kaimmakam was a Moslem Greek. The Kam includes the following four Nahiyes (1910):370 GAZETTEEE OF TOWNS Deireh Harlr Barak Baradost Shirwan Nahiye Head-quarters Deireh Harlr Oellala Sadaqah Beirisivao A battalion of Nizam is usually quartered here (1910); they have no barracks, but camp near the Government buildings which lie in the suburb of Qal'ah Teluk (1904). In 1910 the place was the head quarters of two Eedif battalions, probably nominal, which had not been embodied. There is also a post of 60 zaptiehs (1904). SALAHIYEH (KUFRI ; in some maps also marked Zengabad), on the Baghdad—Mosul main route, 417 m. NNE. of Baghdad. Pop. (800 houses) ? 4,000. T. (Baghdad—Mosul line). Routes— (i) To Baghdad. See Boute 25 a. (ii) To Mosul. See Boute 25 a. (iii) To Suleimaniyeh via Zagirmeh Pass. See 34 a. (iv) To Euleimaniyeh via Dar. See 34 b. (v) To Qasr-i-Shirin. See 33.' (vi) To Ehanikin. See Boutes 32 a, b. General Description. —The town lies in a plain at the mouth of a gorge in a low ridge (300-400 ft. high) to the N., through which the Chechepan (Kufri Su) emerges. The river, on the r. bank of which Salahiyeh stands, is unbridged. A cultivated treeless plain extends for a few miles to the S. and E. for about 10 m. to NW. The hill of Bawa Shah Suwar, to the N. of Kufri, commands an excellent view of the town. There are a shrine and a cemetery on it. The town is surrounded by a mud wall in poor repair. The houses are of stone and mud, with flat roofs; a few on the S./ are built of lime and gypsum from the hills close by. There is a stone khan on the N., outside the town, and a new khan on the E. with upper rooms. It is 40 x 55 yds., with stabling for 150 horses, and of rough stone and cement. There is another khan, single-storeyed, 30 yds. square, and stabling for 50 horses. Supplies and Commerce. —There is a bazaar at Salahiyeh containing about 80 shops with a fair amount of supplies (flour, dates, dried fruits). The neighbourhood is said to produce good wheat, and near the town are gardens with date and fruit trees. Sheep and goats are plentiful in normal times. The water, which comes from theEOWANDUZ—SALAHIYEH—SAMAKEA 371 Kufri Su east of the town, is abundant and good. There is very- good grazing in the neighbourhood of the town. Fuel is plentiful. In normal times it was estimated that 400 horses and 300 mules might be obtained here. The Nasaleh coal workings lie in the low hills E. of the town, the nearest being about | hour from the town: the newest workings apparently lie at a distance of 1 or 2 m. The coal obtained before the war was of poor quality, but possibly a better quality has since been found in deeper workings. It is said that three workmen can excavate about 30 cwt. or 20 donkey-loads daily, and the coal is sold in Salahiyeh at 7^ Kaij Piastres per donkey-load (3|d. a cwt.). During the war coal has been exported by camel to Sindiyeh III D, m. 45^), and thence floated down the Tigris, and a Decauville railway has been reported. Inhabitants. —The inhabitants are mostly Kurds, though there are a few Arabs and Jews. The town lies in the country of the Jaf Kurds, whose power has recently been much reduced by the Turkish Government, though they are still a considerable tribe. They inhabit both sides of the frontier and live a semi-nomadic life, moving between the hills and the plains. The Turkish Jaf claim that, though they are the less numerous section, they number 3,000 mounted men: this is probably an exaggeration. In the country towards Khanikin live the Bajalan Kurds (150 riders) and the Zengabad Kurds (270 riders). The Hamawand Kurds at least as late as 1910 were a serious danger on the roads in the neighbourhood, and in spite of measures taken against them in recent years may possibly still cause trouble. Administration. —The Turkish Government is represented here by a Kaimmakam, and there was before the war a post of infantry mounted on mules. SAM ARB.

In Oct. 1903 (1. w.), when river was 370 yds. wide, only 270 yards were spanned by 32 boats: on k a nk it was necessary after leaving bridge to cross some shallow water for about 80 yds. to a sandbank, from which the river bank i C qao \ be reaclled - Roadway across bridge 12 ft. wide.

It apparently runs by Abu Khasheb and S. end of Tartar River, which carries water after rain. (iv) To Mosul via r. bank of Tigris. See 25 b. General Description. —The modern town is reported as lying about- 400 yards from the river bank. The country round is a rolling sandy plain strewn with ruins, with few or no signs of vegetation visible from the city. The river varies in breadth between 370 and ' 460 yds., according to the season. Its current is 3 m. an hour (mean water ?), and the depth is considerable : information reported unreliable estimates it at 30 ft. in deepest places. The 1. bank is high and steep, shutting off the view of the town from the opposite side of the river. The height is estimated at 60-70 ft. above low-water level. The r. bank is said to be about 30 ft. high (above low-water level) and steep. The banks and river-bottom are mainly firm earth, with not much sand and few stones (the sand is found chiefly on r. bank). On the r. bank at the bridge is a small village of 40 mud houses and a khan 50 yds. square, with stabling. The town is surrounded by a polygonal wall, with about 15 sides, 20 ft. high and 4 ft. thick, until near the top, where it narrows to little over 2 ft. It is crenelated with 2 rows of loopholes, one at a height of 6 ft., the other near the top. It has four gates, north, south, east, and west, and has a semi-circular bastion at each salient angle built to flank the curtains. The ruins and broken ground in the vicinity would afford good cover for an attack. The town is said to contain about 900 houses, mostly of brick, but not only is there much open space within the wall, but many of the houses are empty (as in the area S. of N. wall), and the place seems to be declining. Its im portance lies in its position on the Shiah pilgrim route from Persia to Kerbela and on its own sanctity as containing the tombs of the 10th and 11th Shiah Imams, and the cleft into which the 12th Imam (the Imam Mahdi) is believed to have vanished, and from which he is expected one day to reappear when he comes to establish the true faith upon earth. The principal Mosque in the modern town, where the Imams are buried, is jealously guarded against infidel intrusion. The tombs of the 10th and 11th Mahdis are under a dome of fine Persian tiles, while a smaller dome covered with gold-leaf is built over the place where the Imam Mahdi disappeared. Of the ruinedSAMAKKA 373 buildings of old Samarra, the most important lie to the N. of the present city. A few hundred yards outside the walls lie the ruins of the great Mosque (260 yds. x 170 yds.), a large rectangular enclosure (middle 9th century a. d .), surrounded by a ruinous wall, with four large angle towers, with smaller rounded bastions at intervals of about 20 ft. The longer sides run N. and S. There is a large gate in the middle of the southern side. The E. and W. walls are broken by numerous doors. The wall above the larger doors has in every case fallen away. There are 5 gates to the N. 'Windows occur irregularly. Near the centre of the N. wall stands a minaret called the Malwiyeh, about 160 ft. high, which is ascended by an external spiral path. From the top there is a wide view over the town of Samarra and the neighbouring country. To the X. of the Malwiyeh, between it and the ruins called the Beit el-Khallfeh, a space of nearly 3,000 yds. is covered with the remains of walls and streets. Supplies and Commerce. — Local supplies are described in general as limited, but before the war the town must have had sufficient provisions for the numerous Shiah pilgrims who visit or pass through the town. Melons and vegetables appear to be the chief agricultural export. The Baghdad supply of melons comes mainly from bamarra. There are no wells in Samarra containing drinkable water but the water which is obtained from the river is said to be excellent.' The pilgrim-waggons (capable of carrying about 20 men) which ply between Samarra and Baghdad are owned in Kazimain, but in the pilgrim-season there are usually 10-20 of them in the small village which lies opposite Samarra on the r. bank. Large sailing boats (boghalehs and saflnehs) can ascend to Samarra, except, apparently when the current is strongest at flood-time, and quffehs are still in use (see vol. i, p. 166). Before the war a small steamer made weeklv voyages to Samarra from Baghdad. /nAaMante.—Probably about four-fifths of the inhabitants are bmahs, and there is a Persian community in the place. Persian is said to be more spoken here than Arabic, and Persian coinage prevails. A few Jews are settled here, and there is a small British Indian colony, mostly Kashmiris. Administration and Authorities. —Samarra is the headquarters of a Kaza in the Vilayet of Baghdad, Histoiy.—-Samarra, was a small town for many centuries in the Assyrian, Persian, Greek, and Sassanian periods (here the army of the Roman Emperor Julian halted in its retreat from Ctesiphon fLk D '- • a , 1 near the toW11 Julian died of wounds); but at egmning of the ninth century there seems to have been little 0374 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS on the site but a Christian monastery. In 836 the Caliph Hutasim, anxious for political reasons to leave Baghdad, fixed on Samarra as the site of his new capital; and within the following thirty-seven years a great city rose, extending for 21 m. along the Tigris, with palaces, mosques, and extensive quarters for the Caliph's Guard (a large body of Turks and Berbers who had caused great discontent among the people of Baghdad when the Caliph resided there). About the year 872 the Caliph Muhtadi brought back the court to Baghdad, and Samarra fell into decay, being kept alive only by its connexion with the Shiah sect. SULEIMAMTYEH, v 60 m.

General Description. —Suleimaniyeh lies on the lower slope of the hills between two spurs. Through the valley between the spurs runs an abundant supply of excellent water. The town itself, seen from without, is insignificant, possessing no large buildings or anything conspicuous except a minaret recently erected. It has, however, a fine open square in the middle of the town on to which the Government buildings face, and a very fine vaulted bazaar. The streets are narrow and dirty, and most of the houses are fiat- roofed mud huts. A report of 1904 says that the barracks were a rather ruinous line of buildings of burnt brick. There are no walls or fortifications, the outskirts being composed of small one-storeyed houses. Supplies and Commerce. —There are fair supplies of cereals, vegetable and dairy produce from the neighbouring Kurds, though the capacities of the place as a base of supply are probably not what they were 10 years ago, for reasons explained below. The hills to the E. are well-wooded. The water-supply is very good and comes from some large springs near the town.SAMAEEA—SULEIMANIYEH X, 375 At the accession of Abdul Hamid the town was a market for the produce of all southern Kurdistan. Carpets for Mosul and Baghdad came here for sale, gum from Banah began to be sold here in stead of in Senna, and a large number of Chaldaeans of Mosul carried on here an extensive and profitable business in the cotton cloths of Aleppo and European fabrics. The beys and pashas of the Jaf tribe entered into agreements to send all the produce of the tribe—skins, wool, tobacco, and butter—to the bazaars of Sulei- maniyeh. In 1880 the value of the trade was estimated at .£T500,000. In 1909 it had sunk to =£T400,000 and was decreasing. The reason is to be found partly in the history of the town during the interval (see below), partly in the presence of a 15 per cent, customs duty. An important local industry is the manufacture of fire-arms, especially of rifles. The model for this is the Martini-Peabody American patent, but the bore is that of the Russian Bourdan rifle. All the cartridges are of Eussian manufacture. These weapons, which can be turned out at the rate of about 9,000 per annum, are fairly reliable up to 500 yds. One craftsman constructs the barrels (spirally welded strips of sheet-iron), another the locks and springs, a third collects and browns the arms and an agent sells them, the cheapest for £T2, the dearest for £T4. There is an excellent market for the weapons among the neighbouring Kurds. Shoe-making and saddlery are also important occupations. The coinage-system and weights and measures at Suleimaniyeh are more than usually complicated. Though it is long since the town belonged to Persia the Persian currency has been retained, no Turkish coin being accepted but the mejidieh. The actual coins are the copper ' pul', the silver ' baichu ' or Persian ' panj shahi ' and the ordinary 2-qran piece of Persia, here called ' tihraniEvery thing is reckoned in ' qamari', an imaginary coin worth 4 pul. The 'baichu' is worth 7 pul. For larger amounts there is the 'tihrani' which is equivalent to 5 baichu and 1 pul, or 9 qamari. Other names used are 'charkhi ', ' jout' deh para', ' ghazi' qran', and ' qran-i-rash (It may be noted that in Kirkuk the baichu is called a qamari and the tihrani a qran.) As for weights, the local ' huqqa' is equivalent to 2-| times that of the Stamboul ' okewhich is the basis throughout Asiatic Turkey. It is also, however, f of the Panjurn huqqa, f of a Tabriz man', and f of the Halebjeh 'man It is divided into 400 dirhams, and all fractions must be expressed in Turkish. Inhabitants. —The inhabitants are a mixture of Kurdish, Arab,376 GrAZETTEEE OF TOWNS and Turkish stock. There are said to be 100 houses of Jews and 20 of Christians who live in a separate quarter outside the town. Kurdish is the chief language spoken, though nearly everybody understands Persian. The dress is partly that of the Kurds, but in costume and other matters the natives are said to be extremely conservative. They are also suspicious and inquisitorial in their bearing towards strangers. Administration and Authorities. —The place is the seat of a Mutes- sarif under Mosul. There is also a Persian consul. The usual garrison is 4 battalions of about 400 men each (report of 1904). See also under History. History. —The importance of the place in modern times dates from the time of Suleiman Pasha of Baghdad. In 1779, during his tenure of office, the government of the district, which was then ruled by chiefs descended from a Kurdish priest called Mullah Ahmed, was transferred to the site of the present town. A government house and other buildings were built and the new town called Suleimani. In 1851 Kurdish rule in Suleimaniyeh (the more modern name of the town) came to an end with the seizure of Abdallah Pasha and his brother Ahmed. Ismail Pasha, a Turk, was appointed kaimmakam, and a garrison sent to the town. Prom now onward the priests, free of the restraints imposed by the Kurdish pashas, gradually acquired for themselves a position which kept both governor and governed in awe. Up till 1876, however, under Sultan Abdul Aziz, they contented themselves with gaining a reputation for sanctity. After the Sultan's death and the accession of Abdul Hamid, Sheikh Sa'id, the leader of the priestly family, began a system of self-aggrandizement and enrich ment. This led to revolts on the part of the people who summoned the Hamawands to expel the governor and sheikhs. The arrival of a battalion from Kirkuk drove off the Hamawands and Sheikh Sa'id began a campaign of open robbery,- assisted by a very effective spy-system. The merchants were the chief sufferers, many of whom moved into Persia, as did also the fruit and vegetable cultivators in consequence of a 300 per cent, special entry duty imposed on every load entering the town. The ultimate object of the Sheikhs seems to have been to make themselves practically independent. Matters at last reached such a pass that Sheikh Sa'id was summoned, or rather induced, to come to Mosul with some members of his family, where he was murdered by the mob in 1909, at the age of 85. Thereupon fresh revolts broke out in Suleimaniyeh, fomented by the family of the sheikh who had influence both there and in Constanti nople, and in August 1909 the sheikhs were still predominant.SULEIMANIYEH—TEKRIT 377 TEKEJT, on r. bank of the Tigris, 31 m. above Samarra by river.

General Description. —The town is built in the form of a semi-circle on conglomerate cliffs, which at the centre of the town rise to a height of 50-60 ft. The frontage of the town on the river is 400 or 500 yds. The stream here has been estimated at 250 yds. wide in October (1903), and 500-600 yds. wide in May (1910). It is shallow on the Tekrit side. In May 1910 it was possible to wade 100 yds. from the r. bank. The current has been estimated at 2-3 m. an hour (1. w. season). Along the banks, where there are no bluffs, there is a strip of cultivated land averaging ^ m. in width. W. of the town there is high broken and stony ground, uncultivated. The neigh bourhood of Tekrit is covered with ruins of the pre-Mohammedan city. There is a wide view over the country to S., N., and E. from an eminence a few minutes W. of the town. Jebel Selweh, 4^ m. WNW., rises to 407 ft. Above Tekrit the cliffs (mud and conglomerate) continue on the r. bank. The district immediately above the town is called Qa'im. Supplies and Commerce. —A few poor shops; sheep exported over land to Syria. Small local export of cereals, melons, &amp;c. ; import of cheap manufactured goods. The place is a centre of rafting trade down-stream; many raftsmen live here. Several large boats are available, fit to carry horses, which, however, are usually swum across the river. The wickerwork (ferry-boats) carry 10-15 men each. Inhabitants. —Mixed Arab population; the men are largely employed as raftsmen (some of them are settled for this purpose in Mosul). Administration. —The place is administered by a Mudir, under the Kaimmakam of Samarra.TEANSLITEEATION OF AEABIC, PEESIAN, AND TUEKISH NAMES An attempt has been made in the Handbook to transliterate Arabic, Persian, and Turkish names upon a uniform system, which is explained in detail in the following paragraphs. The aim has been to assist the reader in their correct pronunciation, without overburdening the text with a large number of dia critical marks. It will be noted that a long accent is used to mark the length of a vowel above which it is placed (a, I, o, u); the only other symbols employed are ' for the consonant Ain, and ' for the Hamzah, or cutting off of the breath which can precede or follow a vowel. Conventional spellings have been retained when sanctioned by general usage; a list of examples, with their correct equivalents, is given on p. 387.TEANSLITERATION OF ARABIC NAMES 383 V. Compound 14. The two components in a compound name (in the absence of the izafat or J1 between them) are written with a capital and without a hyphen connecting them, e. g. Da'ud. 15. When, however, the second member of the compound is a verbal root or is inseparably connected with the first, the whole has been treated as one word whether written in vernacular as one word or two, e. g. Imamsadeh, Salm 16. Words which have become Europeanized are left in that form, e.g. Mecca (for MaTikah), Basra (for al-Basrah), Medina (for al-Medmah). 17. The Arabic article J1 prefixed to names has been omitted in English, except in cases where its retention is authorized by general usage. 18. The word iln occurring in the name of a person is written without a hyphen before or after it, e .g. TbraMm. II PERSIAN I. Consonan 19. The same as for Arabic, plus : V = P i = z ^ = z j = v or w ^J = s j = zh £f=g ^ = c h II. Vowe 20. The same as for Arabic.384 TEANSLITEEATION OF PEESIAN NAMES III. Dipht 21. The same as for Arabic.

Kelehs conveying troops down the Tigris are said to carry usually 75 men each. But it is also reported that a may carry up to 40 tons or 150 men. For times based on evidence dating from before the war see p. 40 (Mosul—Samarra), and p. 20 (Samarra—Baghdad). The JceleJcs conveying troops are said to travel by day only. The following times are taken from the diary of a Turkish officer who descended the river in January 1916 :— 1st day 8J hrs. 2nd day 6 hrs. 3rd day 7 hrs. 4th day 6 hrs. 5th day (Tekrit) 5 hrs. 6th day (Samarra) 8 hrs. (From Samarra the journey to Baghdad was made by rail in 5 hrs.)396 APPENDIX The Euphrates and Connexions between the Euphrates and Baghdad (Compare Route IV E-H.) (i) The following are estimated normal times for native craft {shaMdurs) descending the Euphrates from Meskeneh to Eellujeh:— March-June : 6 days July-February : 12 days A Turkish prisoner seems to have taken 15 days on the journey in January 1916. It is rumoured that metal rafts are to be used on the Euphrates. (ii) There are now (1916) stores of petroleum at Hit, and depots of supplies at Anah and Deir ez-Zor. Compare pp. 351-352, 353-354, 356-357. (iii) Grain is reported to be sent from Deir to Eidhwaniyeh (see vol. ii, Boute IV D) by a small launch with barge. Eidhwaniyeh is the western terminus of the Decauville railway from the Euphrates to Baghdad via Abu Thubbah and Tel Aswad (see vol. ii, Appendix). (iv) It is reported that in 1916 motor-boats were sent from Baghdad to the Euphrates through the Saqlawiyeh Canal (see IV E, m. 8).

Caravans frequently use whole route. Miles from Khanikin 0 Ehanikin. General direction to Haush Kuri N. : quite flat. Water en route only from villages off road. Fodder sometimes from district of Ben Kudra, on Turkish side of frontier-towers and fort passed at m. 13. 15 Haush. Kuri, on stony ground under low peaked hill. Water from spring and stream. Very little supplies. From here route proceeds up Sirwan (Diyaleh) Eiver: tracks marked on both banks, but no information as to their nature except that they are well used.APPENDIX 397 Miles from Khanikin At Sheikh Nasr-ed-Din's village on 1. bank, a route joins from Chiah Surkh (about 14 m. distant). At Banakhilan ford, route from Chiah Surkh and Hurin joins from SSE., and route to Suleimaniyeh via Qara Dagh diverges to NW. See (iv) below. 75 ? Halebjeh. For route to Suleimaniyeh see 35. 120 Suleimaniyeh. (ii) Qask-i-Shikin—Suleimaniyeh Via Haush Kuki and Halebjeh.

Cross flat space outside Qasr-i-Shirin, at N. end of which track narrows and goes over seven sandstone ridges : rocky descent from last. Thence over flat ground to bank of Quretu River, very muddy after rain. Here track crosses some bad gullies. Quretu village on mound by 1. bank of river, 7 m. from Qasr-i-Shiiln. River crossed here by a ford bad after rain. Proceed NE. to Saikavand over gravel and mud. Cross Qizil stream by ford very bad after rain:398 APPENDIX stream is dry after April. Saikavand is a hamlet at foot of cliff on S. side of brook. Broad road hence ascends gradually to a high ridge, whence a bad descent leads through a valley about ^ m. broad where the ground is marshy and treacherous. From here path ascends steeply to the Oil Company's works at Chlah. Surkh. The Quretu River is crossed by a good ford apparently to E. of that mentioned above. A track leads to it, and, after crossing the Qizil stream 2 m. farther on, rejoins the other track 1 m. before Saikavand. (iv) Chi ah Sukkh—Suleimaniyeh Via Hurin and Banakhilan. Well used by pack-caravans. Hours from CHiah Surkh. o 9 13 Chiah Surkh.

Good going for all pack-animals to— Principal village of Hajilar. Prom here road almost to Hurin flat and good going, except at slight rise over Nao Machik, which presents no serious difficulties. The 'Abbasan ford at foot of these hills is quite easy. Approach to Hurin, on spur of the Bamu, about 400 ft. above the plain, is bad and stony. Water at several places, and large quantities of barley, wheat, rice, and maize are obtainable. Hurin. Alternative road from Chiah Surkh to Hurin, not so good as that described above and 1 hr. longer, goes NE. to Dar-i-Divan range, which it crosses by an easy pass, thence through eastern ridge of the same system (no difficulties), to Tileku Plain, flat and stoneless. Ample water here from spring and the stream, which disappears before the passage between the Band-i-Htian and Shawaldir hills to E. Eoad runs through this passage into Ser Qalau Plain, flat and stoneless. Abbasan R. crossed between Bawisi (summer village) and Mamishan (no village). Thence road leads along foot of Bamu hills, becoming very stony in parts. Abundant water Hurin in 10 hrs. Prom Hurin the road is stony and narrow, across spurs of Khoshik, till a descent is made to Basak, whence there is easy going to— Banakhilan ford on the Sirwan (upper Diyaleh). Thence two stages by Qara Dagh to Suleimaniyeh.(WO) APPENDIX 399 Hours from ChiaH. Surkh (v) Chiah Sdekh—Halebjeh. From Chiah Surkh, road leads E. to Pet Bur cliff: good going so far. Thence over undulating country to Kel-i- Huan, a narrow passage between the S. end of the Dar-i- Dlvan and Band-i-Huan, and the N. end of the Biznan Mt. Eoad stony near hills. Water at western mouth of Kel-i- Huan under a tree, 2 m. E. of Pet Bur. Beyond the Kel-i-Huan over stoneless plain to— Ser Qalau. Small village : scanty supplies : water from strong spring. Koad leads N. over low neck of Taqtaq, and as it descends into Jaiglran, an almost N. direction is taken. The 'Abbasan and Cham-i-Garrai streams are crossed, and a short distance farther N. is— Asgilleh village, low down on a spur of Bamu. Some supplies. Prom here road rises to neck between Bamu and N. end of Garrai, and then descends, keeping along Cham-i-Qala stream, which it follows as far as junction with the Naijanao stream. It then ascends the spurs of Shah Karam and Pusht-i-Qalan mts. by a rough, bad track, and descends into Shemlran Plain. Shemiran Plain. Hence it is 1 day's march to Halebjeh. The Sirwan is crossed apparently at Sirawan.0 CITY OF BAGHDAD</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100023045519.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/41/4</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023045519.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/41/4</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Handbook of Mesopotamia.
