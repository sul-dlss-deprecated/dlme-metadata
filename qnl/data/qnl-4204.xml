The letter states that the main object of the Persian Government in placing the order was to show the Persian flag in foreign ports. Because they were afraid of getting the worst of the deal if they bought second-hand vessels, their preference was to buy new ones, and they wished to obtain advice from the Department of Trade before placing any orders. It was therefore desirable that any such order should be placed in the United Kingdom. With covering letter from the British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire to the Political Agent, Bahrain, dated 27 January 1934.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Charles Dalrymple Belgrave</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000059#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
