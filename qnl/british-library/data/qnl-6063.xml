Rep ort by Abdul Razzak Yusuf al JBadr on the death of Badr Yusuf .on_30/l/37 translated by Abdulla Mulla jSaletu DEATH O F BADR YUSUF_0N 30-1-1937. After finishing his duty at 2 P.M. he came to his quarters and took two cups of Arab tea. Then he took bath and after having taken rest for ten minutes, he again had two cups of tea. At about 11 O’clock Arabic (about 4 P.M.)he went to play football with his Arab friends and played for about 45 minutes after which he felt pain in his heart. So he left the play and sat on the petrol tin near the playground for ten minutes. Then he walked to a small hut and lay down outside of it for ten minutes. Afterwards he sent a boy for his brother Abdur-Razzak. When the latter came, he found Manzoor, one of the drivers standing beside him. Badr informed his brother that he was feeling pain in his heart and could not walk. So his brother and three of his friends present there carried him to his brother's hut No.16. They laid him on the bed in the hut and his brother and Sulaiman Abdus-Salam went to summon the Doctor who came and examined him. Afterwards the Doctor asked his brother to take him to the Dispensary. Accordingly his brother and friends took him there in the touring car and the Doctor gave him medicine in a small glass, but when his brother poured it in his mouth, he vomitted it at once, after which he got a little rest. Then the Doctor brought medicine for smelling. When it was taken near his nose he suddenly became unconscious, and his hands and feet shrinked and stopped talking. After 5 minutes, the Doctor gave him same medicine and after 2 minutes an injection in his muscle of forearm was given. After 15 minutes he died.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Dbpartmint, led’iBjjj i EXPRESS LETTER JBS.l I Bd joo! ■V 'lej'lz (V.

If you will enquire as to the price ofilsh 4 and b years ago you will find that it was more expensive than it is now. The price just at the moment is decreasing, b. Coffee, wheat, and flour have all risen in the ..orId market ana I would refer yoi to the Comparative Tables of Commodity Prices which appear under the heading 'Finance and Commerce' in the .Vee .ly Times, The same rise in prices is experienced in other Gulf ports* The f;. ct that the .'orld rise is slightly less than the local rise is I assume accounted for by the fact th t when there is a demand in the /orld market the worst place to be from individual consumer’s point of view is near but not et an individual point of sup ly, since no one will divert to sell in a small market close at hand, when they are hurrying their goons away to a rising -orId market. 4. as regards mutton there hi s been a steady increase in the price in both Iraq and Kuwait since the buying of lambskins for Europe begun some years ago, ’ive years ago in Iraq an average sheep cost Ks.b/- today it costs Rs.ll/-. Iresumab^y beef would rise in sympathy as the price of mutton rises. Here in Kuwait it would on top of this perhaps rise to meet the recent demand by Juropeans./hen it is Hppreciuted in -iraq that there is a permanent increase of demand in Kuwait there v/ill be greater supply of beef and the price should drop somewhat, b. The remarks immediately above a pply to the rise in the price of eggs and certain vegetables. The purveyors have not had time to adjust the supply to the demand. The supply of vegetables to Kuwait is a matter being taken up seriously by several enterprising merchants in and outside Kuwait and a /ery great improvement in quality and price will soon take plat;e. 6. borne rises in prices that rosy interest you among goods not consumed by Europeans are:- Coraraodity 19S5 1937 Increa Cardamom beans Rs.7 per Rs. 17 p sr 143 ^ /aqiya h /aqiyah Clarified Butter lis.i/a/- Hs.1/12/- 16 &lt;7* Apricots as.-/a/- Rs.l/- 100 c /b Charcoal Hs.ii/lO/- Hs.b/5/- 47 &gt; per bag per bag Bate oyrup as.2/4/- Rs.iV - 33 % Tamarind Rs.4/- *s. o/- 50 /o Arab clothes 6 yds. 4 yds per 50 ^ per rupee rupee Salt Rs.-/o/- Rs.-/12/- 100 c /o per maund per maund In an official report from the Political Agent, Bahrain, dated blst Janusx^y l^b7, there occurs the following: 'Rumours of war based on the unsettled political 'situation in .urope have result :d in a substantial 'rise in prices of piece goods and luxuries in 'Lhe Bahrain market'. from the above it will I think be clear that in Kuwait no 'set' is being made at Europeans only, and thet the rise in the price of certain commodities is, except in very small degree as noted above, not due to the arrival of the Kuwait Oil Company, as might perhaps be supposed.

The routine of the observation takes about three or four hours with a little luck* Thus if nothing goes wrong,as it well may do with a relatively complex and delicate instrument one should be able to complete the observation in the course of one day. The observation consists of the following steps: (1) Determination of true north( axis of earths rotation) by observation either of the pole star or the sun with a transit* (2) Determination of magnetic north ( position of earths magnetie pole) so that deviation from true north can be determined* True north was determined in step (1)* (3) Determination of magnetic dip; i* e* , how far a magnetic needle deviates from the horizontal when it is free to rotate in a vertical plane. (4) Determination of Magnetic dip with an earth inductor compass (much as is used to determine direction on RAF and imperial Airway^ planes) which is much more sensitive and accurate than the dip needle. (5) Measurment of the strength of the earths magnetic field at the point of observation. Steps 2, 3, and 4 determine uniquely the direction of the earths magnetic field; step 5 determines the strength. Paul H. Boots* CONFIDENTIAL. JJo.

Our Reference H.M's Political Agent, KUWAIT. 5698 • Sir, We have the honour to confirm our recent conversations regarding monetary and exchange conditions in Kuwait and wish to thank you for the enquiries that you have made in this connection. We confirm the following points raised in our first conversation on the 11th May (1) The Kuwait Oil Co., have a banking account with the Eastern Bank, Ltd., Basrah, the method hitherto employed of obtaining cash lias been to sell Dinar cheques to an Arab merchant, Abdul Kerim Abul, who acts, we understand, as the Ruler's Treasurer and Rent Collector. (2) Until 5/5/37 we experienced no difficulty in obtaining rupee coin in this manner at rates of exchange approximat ing those ruling in Iraq, but on the date mentioned, we were informed that owing to the flooding of the Kuwait market with Dinars, a rate of Rs.13/1 per Dinar was the best Kuwait offer. At this time the Dinar/Rupee rate in Basrah was Rs.13/3/5. (3) On making enquiries of Abdulla Mulla Saleh we were Informed that the causes of this unfavourable rate were:- (A) Heavy purchases by Iraq merchants of lamb skins for v/hich payment was made in Dinars • (B) Seasonal requirements of Indian exchange to meet cost of rice and other Indian shipments arriving at this time of the year. (C) Requirements of rupees for financing the pearling fleet. (4) In view of the alleged local market conditions we obtained from our bankers in Basrah, Rs.20,000 worth of rupee drafts at the Basrah rate of exchange and these, Abdul Kerim Abul undertook to cash locally at 1% commission. In this way a rate of exchange slightly better than the local offer was obtained. (5) After obtaining Rs.16,000 in coin we were informed by Abdul Kerim Abul’s son that owing to export of rupees there were only 30,000 rupees available in the Town and there were no sellers. (Subsequently we have been able to cash our remaining drafts at no commission through Messrs.Gray Mackenzie Ltd.)/) (6 ) On receipt of this information we instituted enquiries which resulted in the allegation that (7) Other enquiries also elicited the fact that one of the biggest employers of labour amongst the local merchants was also having difficulty in obtaining rupee coin. (8 ) In view of the difficulty of the position and the possibility that it was being engineered by a small ring of local merchants, the matter was brought to your notice. resulting from your enquiries into the matter the following points have been made by the Ruler or his representative (Abdulla Mulla Saleh) (1) That there is no actual shortage of rupee coin in the Town. (2) That the present position is a seasonal one due to slackness of business at this time of the year. Local merchants at this season not requiring to purchase either Dinars in Iraq or Rupees in India due to this cause • (3) The position will in all probability rectify itself in the early autumn when the date crop comes on to the market. advising our London Office of the situation and recommending that steps be taken to make us independent of the local exchange market in case of necessity. about 750,000 rupees in silver had been exported during the year.

Shortage of rupee coin in Kuwait» Sir I have the honour to enc a letter from the Kuwait Oil Company, Wo*5698, dated the 15th May 1937, on the subject of exchange conditions in Kuwait. Kuwait Oil Company informed me, during the course of a general discussion on oil matters, that he had experienced some difficulty in obtaining in Kuwait a sufficient number of rupees to pay the monthly salary bill of the Company’s employees for the month of April. Mr.Scott went on to say that as a result of his enquiries he had learned that during the past year approximately 750,000 rupees had been exported from Kuwait with the result that there was now a serious shortage of rupees in the Town. 3. After my discussion with Mr.Scott, I mentioned the matter at an interview with His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait. His Highness assured me that there was no question of a shortage of rupees in Kuwait but that the Company’s difficulties had arisen solely out of the natural seasonal requirements of Indian exchange to meet shipments of goods arriving from India at this time of the year. His Hi^iness’s assurances were confirmed by enquiries I made from two of the leading merchants in Kuwait. On the 14 th May Mr .Scott, Fields Manager of the Though the result of my enquiries has been reassuri ng/ 4* 2 ■» reassuring a review of the figures quoted in the annual Trade Report for the years 19^4, 1935, and 1936 shows that during the ie st few years specie to the value of approximately ! Million rupees has been exported from Kuwait as opposed to imports amounting to some Rs.15,000 only. Presumably when the negotiations for the opening of a Bank in Kuwait are completed the export of specie will cease. In the meantime, however, it is possible that should the present high rate of export of specie continue the shortage complained of by the Manager of the Kuwait Oil Company may become embarrassing. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Captain, Political Agent, Kuwait. ►1/37. May, 1937.

' Sir Trenchard was interested by Stewards letter C-144 about-tlie shortage of rupee coin in Kuwait, which he discussed with me. It seems a rather queer business, and difficult to .ge of from a distance. Such an (apparently) excep- nal tightness of money could hardly be accounted for *ely by seasonal fluctuation in the demand for rupee n. On the other hand a carefully engineered ramp the part of the local merchants also seems improbable It occurs to me that the habit of hoarding, to which you have drawn attention ( in part 2 para: 12 of your Trade Report for 1935-36 ) as being a parti cularly prevalent habit among Kuwaiti merchants, might have something to do with such a situation as this. Any scare of a shortage of specie would naturally react ptain O.S. De Oaury, M.C., The Political Agent, Kuwait.2 very quickly in a society where wealth is reckoned by bags of silver rather than bank balances. Once the shortage of coin in circulation had become a fact, one or two of the merchants may well have gone on to take advantage of it, as it seems Abul Kerim attempted to do at the expense of the Kuv/ait Oil Company. But there seems no doubt that a steady outflow of specie has taken place during the last few years, and it is a matter for speculation where it has all gone. If you have any views on this, I would be very grateful if you would let me have them some time.L.o.;'i0.s-/7i~ !'U. 1 aIT The July lii.7. ; wia.a. lot you huve, for Gir Tronchard’s Iriforiaatioa, h full not a on the cor^exicy situation quite aeon, it is not duo to a coxupiracy a^ainst tho Kuwait Oil Company. the Mu'VQit Oil Company and the flow and ebb of commodities in Kuwait, I enclose copies of letters exchanged lest 'inter bet eon the Guperintendent yesterday told lae taui Lho ouporintondent, some weeks a^o, when I was away, was i.iucd pertui'bod TThei* he saw (or heard of) a oarloed of tomatoes on the road from Kuwait to Kubf ir.

Since the difficulty mentioned in the letters from Stewart and the General superintendent, the broker will by arrange ment give the rate of Rs. 15/5/6 only and receive at Ise.st a week’s notice of the Company’s requirements. (b) The difficulty was not so much the shortage of rupees as the excess of Dinars. Dinar cheques seemed to have flooded into Kuwait owing, first to a favourable rate of exchange, of which many people wished to take advantage, and then owing to the purchase of 50,000 lambskins by the Hudson Bay Company’s agent who paid for them by Dinar cheque. At this moment came the seasonal shortage of rupees. The Company’s broker found himself quite unable to find a good market for more dinar cheques and the Dinar fell to Rs.15/2/-. (c) On the other hand the average purchase price in Kuwait of rupee cheques on Karachi or Bombay is Rs.105/- for a cheque of Rs.100, such is the demand for cheques on India - Kuwait being economically more closely tied Their arrangement last year was that their cheques 7. H. Young Young, Isquire, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul BID HIRC.4./ - 2 - tied to India than Iraq, since most of her imports come to her from India. The purchase price of rupee cheques rises at times even as hi.^i as Hs.lOB per Rs.lQO cheque. (d) Vith regard to your remarks about specie, the exports of specie quoted in my reports must be set against the large sums coming in from (i) pearls sold for cash in Bahrain, (ii) the carrying trade in the Indian Ocean estimated at Rs.1,000,000 for one year 1935, (see my Intelligence Report No.9 of 1936 )• No exact figures are available since rupees are not imported ss 'specie'* (e) Two years ago Ibn Baud legalized the tendering of rupee in Saudi Arabia since vdien rupees have gone in that direction, e.g. against sheep sold to Kuwaitis, but o ving to the blockade do not return readily* (f) The Kuwait Oil Company is, - as individuals in the Company have pointed out to me - responsible fo r a wider distribution ofmofley* (g) Probably owing to better communications there is an increasing confidence in and exchange of cheques on T ^^ia in Kuwait, without movement of coin in Kuwait, e.g* between Kuwaiti pearl merchants and Kuwaiti importers* More Kuwaitis than heretofore own property in Bombay. (h) Rupees at one time Retiee-ifi-is^-kav-e-gsadualiyalwayB available at short notice in Iraq have gradually, since the change in the Iraqi currency, become rarer there* you are aware, it is always difficult to trace to their ultimate source various and some times conflicting financial currents, but I think I have Slven you all the more obviously relevant facts./ - a - 4* I conclude that Rupees are in fact somewhat shorter than they used to be, having ^one to India tnd Saudi Arabia, but that in any case the Kuwait Oil Conpany would have done better to use a bank in India, and not Iraq. 7ithin the Indian orbit, and where Rupee cheques ore wanted, they are trying to force linar cheques. njro C.10.36 KUWAIT OIL COMPANY, LIMITED.

FOR KUWAIT OIL COMPANY LIMITED.ARTICLE IN HEW3PAPBH 'AL SIJIL' DATED 6«7,g7 . HUs tha Kuwait Oil Co* failed at Kuwait ie this failure becoming a danger (at the finish). The K.O.C. drilling on the iforth side (of the hay) has ended in nothing* The Company lias encountered failure there, not having found oil after having spent considerable sums of money and working for a whole year on the site reconraended by the Geologists* The equipment has now been taken away and no one is left there* Therefore the Kuwaitis have lost their hopes of oil or black gold as it is called these days* people who have come from Kuwait say that the Company is doing its best in^ survey of the south but the slowness ox results show that they are uncertain of success - they believe that the only place in Kuwait territory that has deep oil is Subahiyah* This place the Saudi government claims as it is part of the land in which Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are partners, in accordance with the agreement mode at Ojair in 1922. The Kuwaitis who are reasonable men are asking (?) is there any reason for this failure and is it a bona flue failure . The Kuwaitis think that after the failure in the North the K*C*C. are surveying the south (though they know the only plentiful supply of oil is at Subahiyah) in order to alter the agreement between themselves and the She^I iq ox Kuwait, as they are relying on the following:- 1. The K#0*C. did not commence work in the north until the Geological party toad finished surveying the ground with a view to finding the likeliest place to drill for oil* A Chief Geologist cam© to Kuwait to give his opinion of the survey of tlje Geological Party and agreed their report* Eow then have they failed after all this accurate survey and is it true that the K.O.C. spent the amount of money they are reputed to have spent on 500 labourers in one year unless they knew there was oil there?m © 2* When the Company commenced operations, Subahiyah was never mentioned but when a dispute arose between the Saudi Government and Kuwait the Company began to discuss the possibilities of Subahiyah and to say that there was oil there These two reasons made the Kuwaitis think badly of the K #0 »C • and try to cletir txiem (out?) in the near future* It is believed that the Company wanted the opportunity of working on this ground jointly owned by the Saudi Government and Kuwait in order to alter the agreement between themselves and Sheikh Sir Ahmed al jabar as Subah, do noo want to leave this subject without drawing attention to one bad fact, and that is the K.0*C. would not play this game unless they knew that the discussions between the Sheikh and themselves were secret and that the substance of the agreement remained unknown to the Kuwaitis - for no Kuwaiti knew anything about it • It is not necessary for us to say that the Sheikh would benefit a great deal by consulting his people before making a final decision in this important matter and should publish the substance of the agreement for his people to study after which they will expound to him their enlightened opinion so as to protect the country^ interests* But so far nothing has been done* Although the Company has begun to play its dangerous game His Highness should not help them in the slightest degree* Physically, Kuwait has no great value except for oil and His Highness should fear God and think of his people and not help the Company in any way to this only wealth of Kuwait* We see no disgrace in His Highness* having a consultation over so important a matter* All leading nations discuss important matters with their people and it is hoped that the Sheikh will follow in their steps* As to the game the K*0*C* has begun to play - we trust it will not succeed* In , s f alla* One of them.CONFIDENTIAL.

It bHB been a matter of some diffioultT to obUln any y«ry pr«ol»e detail of the Munlci p£l l cw T« and Petrol Tax and to date no coot of the the.e taxe. has been forthcoming^ should c^iee of the.e^ document, prove to be obtainable, we will forward them?* you. From enquiries that we have made, it annea**® that up till Auguat 1937 there was a Municipal Car T^T ™ R..2/- per month per vehicle paid by all .ot£ oil o^.r. « e ? ce P tlon &lt;&gt;f the Political Agency Staff who had diplomatic Immunity and such other, a. .ere granted immunity by K.K. the Shaikh. Member, of the Company'. s b|ff * h o had private oar., including General Superintendent and Chief Local Representative did not pay the tax as thev were not informed of its existence^ nor were they asked to pay it# In August 1937 the Municipality obtained permission to substitute for the Motor Car Tax, a tax of 2 annas per tin on Petrol sold in the town. The alteration in the tax was due, we under stand, to difficulty in collecting it and discontent amongst taxi driver* who presumably, do not notice the tax so much in its new font® It is understood that car owners living and obtaining their petrel outside the Town do not pay this tax, however this appears to be a doubtful point® Members of the Company’s Staff owning private cars have been allowed to purchase their petrol requirements through the Company at the Company rdtes and thus have not been paying the Petrol Tax® One other point that may be pertinant is that taxi owners who hire their care by the day to the Company have recently been forced to pay the Car Tax of Ra®2/- per vehicle, in spite of considerable protest, as owing to ths fact that the Company fuels these cars, the owners avoid payment of Petrol Tax. The action taken by the authorities as regards these men seems to us to be quite irregular as their vehicles are employed on Company business and the petrol used is therefore untaxable. However, as they are all Kuwaitis, we consider we should not interfere in this matter* The following points have had our considerationj- (1) Which tax le payable. Motor Car Tax or Petrol Tax ? As the Petrol Tax was substituted for the Motor in so far as the general public were concerned, then the Tax our Staff are liable to pay is the Petrol Tax and not the Car Tax® Payment of a special Motor Car Tax by one section of the community only (i®e.Company Staff^ lays open the to extortionate taxation of that section of the community at the will of the local authorities.NOTE ON PAYlfOT OF CUSTOMS DITTY CQKCESSION AGK';£BmEHT - SECTION 7 A. We understand that at the same time as Abdullah Mullah asked the C*L # R, to obtain the writers views on whether Staff should pay Municipal Car Tax, he asked C#L # R*s views regarding certain wording in Article 7 A of the Concession Agreement. The only imports about which any question can be raised are:- A* Provisions and other items imported for the Provision Store for resale to Staff. B. Articles purchased and imported by the Company on behalf of Staff, or direct importation by the Staff for their own use. ff' The position regarding item A is that in January 1936, it was agreed with the local authorities that foodstuffs for the Prowls ion Stores were importable free of import duty. As alcoholic beverages were a prohibited import, permission was sought of the Customs authorities to import these for the Staff. H.H. the Shaikh was approached by the Customs Director and permission was granted for the import of these without payment of duty. Later, in February 1936, the question arose as to the import free of duty of other provision stores items such as toilet requisites etc. and it was agreed with Abdullah Mullah that these came under the category of ** Supplies*, line 4 article 7 A. As regards section B f such items including Motor Cars, Wirelesses, Gramaphonea, Household goods,Clogthing etc. are declared to the Customs authorities and ^uty on them is paid by the Staff under the provisions of lines 12-15, Article 7 A. The question raised by Abdullah ?!ullah with the C.L.R. recently was whether in his opinion the words * but not for resale to others* ( lines 8 and 9 of Artic3.e 7 A referred to H others outside the Company^ employe* or to ' others including the Company’s Staff *. The C.L.R., we understand, did not express any definite opinion in the matter. Judging by the feeler put forward by Abdullah Mullah, we presume that the local authorities are considering the possibility of raising the question of payment of import duty on all articles impowted under sections A and B above and bringing them into the category w personal goods, cloWthing and general merchandise imported by the Company for tne personal use of its employees or for resale to them, the ordinary duty in force for the time being in ti e state of Kuwait. * The only correspondence that has passed between us in the matter is to be found in our telegram &gt;io.4 of 1936 and your reply in memo No.15 of 10-1-1936, subseqaen / our memo No.50 of 21»1-1936 gave the details of the position at that date which was further modified in February 1936 as mentioned previously.In case this rruestion should b© brought forward in th© near future # w© should lik© to know whether th© present arrangements are in accordance with your views of the meaning of th© Article# We shall then be in a position to take a firm stand in the matter If any question is raised# » Kuwait* 13-2-1938.Telegram G.T.C.

KUWAIT OIL.cos FI 1 7l\L . .'irt A small qiiestlon has arisen between the Company and the Landing Company which no doubt H«H* has heard about. It concerns the unloading of a cargo of barytes which was rushed to us from Abadan on the s«8« n Taraqqi” which Is a shallow draft boat. The Captain was informed of the urgency of the case and instructed in Abadan to see that unloading was carried out as soon as possible* On arrival here he brought his boat in to Shuwaikh and our clerk pointed out the jetty to him, he asked how much water there was there and on being told decided to go alongside. We did not know he was going to do this. The Landxng Company had barges and motor boat out to unload at the usual anchorage. As the steamer went alongside the jetty it was found that the water was too shallow right at the jetty head and a Landing Company barge was utilised between the jetty and the w Taraqqi ,, and the cargo was carried across this by the coolies doing the unloading. Unloading of the barytes from the n Taraqqi n was carried out in accordance with mercantile practice oy tx.e ship *8 agent * s coolies and as the Landing Company luid iiien there they were utilized to carry the bags ivom a point on the jetty on to the foreshore# Under the circumstances, we consider the payment to the Landing Company should comprise:-- 2 ~ W© hay© discussad matter with Khalid Zaid wiiose point of view is that they should toe paid full lightering and unloading rate which is Rs .5/8 plus -/ 6 /~ aharfage s Rs.1041* on the grounds that that was the work they had expected to have to do.

Contract Labour« At preeent the woric of the Company is in ita infancy, if it increaaaa more and more work will be done by contract beoanae this method enablea payment for work on the busia of work done and relieves the Company of the neceseity o*. having to provide excessive auperviaion to ae# tliat labour doer not slack about* Also when a rush of work is in hand or fluctuationa in the amount of work occur theae can still be coped with to a great extent without alterations to Company»s supervisory staff. Contract work may quite soon be enlarged consider- ably and will probably soon entail employment by the contractor of skilled tradesmen who can read drawings and carry out work by measurement etc# One of the greatest handicaps so far, has been the ignorance of contractors of measurement practices and Kuwaiti contractors should obtain information of how contracting for Companies in Iraq, India, etc# is carried out, in order that they can carry out work efficiently on the same lines# Other wise they may lose many opportunities that may offer in the near future* Hoad work, building work, excavation, filling, foundations, pipe screwing, tank eroction, transportation, supply of building materials to sites, are all fields in which contract work may develop* The standard of work done has also got to improve« I am mentioning these points so that E*H* can advise his people as to how they can help themselves to take advantage of opportunities which may arise in future*» 8 « H *H« has asked us j - (1) To send him copies of all contracts and their acceptance etc# There is nothing mentioned in the Concession agreement in this connection, and whilst X will certainly ask the Directors about it, if iuK. desires, my view is that such a step, whilst giving us considerable extra work which we wish to avoid, would be of little use and mirtht not be altogether in our interests at some later date when really big contracts may be arran^d. So far as Kuwaiti contractors are concerned it would be more suitable to tic and so far as we can see, equally suitable to HJI# if he made arrangements for the contractors to provide this information to him* It should be borne in mind however that contractors are always very touchy about their offers being made known to others and in fairness to them this information should be kept very confidentially# (2) H.H* has also requested that our contracts contain a clause to the effect that contractors are to employ only Kuwaitis. Here again certain contracts may require skilled labour and tradesmen of trades not practised In Kuwait and such a clause would put this type of work out (X roach of Kuwaiti contractors which would be to the detriment of tooth the Kuwaitis and ourselves# It appears to us that this question of contractors * labour is one that should be dealt with entirely between the contractors and H.H , s. representatives and that it is not a matter for the Company to deal with. . _-C~L _Yn© &lt;t j t8i* wlshdD tlmt h® coijJLd see more Kuwaiti.® %*p/- ia skilled jobs but t^®y cannot get the necessary skill without training. At present there aeeias to be little attempt being mad© by the young iaen of the town to obtain the necessary training which in moat cases necessitates going abroad for tiae to some place where they can get it. It should be laentioned here that a smattering of knowledge of a job is worse than useless, it only results in being employed for a short ti»e, being found out, and then being discharged as incompetent* As regards 2nd class jobs the first requisite is a better standard of education, particularly in speaking and writing English and in mathematics. After this, special training for the actual job tlat a man decides to try to take up, xauct be undertaken. I append a list of the various types of Jobs in which vacancies may reasonably be e^pectod* Training In the more skilled of these will take as much as five years. It is essential if the Kuwaitis arc to take a full part in the skilled and technical Jobs of the Company, that fathers send their sons away and get them trained.

My dear Baxter, The Jedda manager of California Arabian Standard Oil Company, Lenahan, gave a very optimistic account of the Hasa oilfield two or three days ago. He described it as richer than that of California. He said that the expenditure of a sum of five million dollars up to the end of 1938 had been authorised, and that a refinery would have to be built in Hasa as the one at Bahrain was only sufficient for local purposes. ell No. 7 had been shut down, as there was nowhere to put the oil at present These statements were made to Day, who, as manager of Gellatly, Hankey and Company (Sudan; Limited, represents the Shell interests in the dejaz, and they should perhaps be discounted a little, as Lens.ian nay have been trying to scare the Shell.

(Prepared in the Petroleum Department, June 1938 .)—(Received in Foreign Office, June 11.) General. ., , r FOR the purposes of this summary the Arabian Peninsula may be said to xie south of a line joining Aqaba at the northern end of the Red Sea to Koweit at the northern end of the Persian Gulf. Included in this area are the following States, sheikhdoms or territories, in most of which petroleum concessions have been, or are likely to be, obtained :— (A) Under British sovereignty or protection— Koweit. Bahrein. Qatar. Trucial Sheikhdoms— Ajman. Abu Dhabi. Debai. Ras-al-Khaimah. Sharjah. Umm-al-Quwaim. Aden Colony. Aden Protectorate. (B) Independent States— Saudi Arabia— (i) Red Sea Area. (ii) Nejd (a) Hasa. (b) Remainder of Nejd. The Yemen. Muscat and Oman^ 1 ) (C) Miscellaneous— Koweit Neutral Zone. Petroleum Concessions (Limited). . . 2. As Petroleum Concessions (Limited) are interested m the majority o t e above-mentioned territories it has been thought worth while to include m this summary a short note on the genesis and composition of the company^ 3 The company, which was first registered in October 1935, is a subbidiai &gt; of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the change of name was order to facilitate the securing of concessions outside I ^q- J^ wh ol e ot shares in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) are he d by the same mteiests a the same proportions as obtain in the Iraq 1 etroleum P y* , p . ^ of the twocompanies are similarly composed, except that the Boaid of Feti m His Majesty's Government exercise by custom only a considerable degree oi influence over the affairs of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 9918 [330 1—1] B2 Concessions (Limited) does not include an Iraqi Government Director. Lord Cadman is chairman of both companies. The shareholding of the Iraq Petroleum Company is divided as follows :—- Percentage. British— Anglo-Iranian Oil Company ... ... ... 23-75 Dutch— Royal Dutch Shell ... ... ... ... ... 23-75 French— Compagnie Francaise des Petroles ... ... 23-75 American— Near East Development Company (i.e., Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum in the proportion of 50-50) 23-75 Participation and Investments (Limited)— C. S. Gulbenkian ... ... ... ... ... 5 00 100-00 Koweit. 4. The concession for this territory is held by the Koweit Oil Company (Commercial Agreement, dated the 23rd December, 1934; Political Agreement,( 2 ) dated the 5th March, 1934), the capital of which is held jointly by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of America (Mellon Group). 5. One well was put down on the north side of Koweit Bay, but only small quantities of oil were found. Another well has been drilled at Burgan. south of Koweit Bay, and was successful in striking oil. Koweit Neutral Zone. 6. The boundaries between Koweit and Nejd were settled at the Uquair Conference ol November 1922, when certain territory was recognised as common to these two States. Under this settlement the Rulers of Koweit and Nejd were to enjoy equal rights in the zone until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived Q t between them. Consequently, neither Ruler can grant an oil concession m the zone without the consent of the other. 7. Matters in regard to oil negotiations in the Neutral Zone have, in consequence, reached a deadlock. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) cannot move because the Sheikh of Koweit, to whom application has been made, refuses to grant respect of his share of the oil rights in the zone, since he considers that he is entitled to all the rights in the zone and hopes to obtain them when i bn Saud dies. Petroleum Concessions (Limited), however, have been informed hv the Sheikh of Koweit that he will, if he changes his mind, inform them before any other company. On the other hand, Ibn Saud, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, who is novv thought to favour exploitation of the zone by a British company, is committed to the Standard Oil Company of California by reason of a special agreement with that company, under which they received a preferential position m respect of Ibn Saud s rights in the zone much the same as that which they received in regard to the unallotted areas in Nejd (see paragraphs 24-28 below). Bahrein. d f ^ eve ^ 0 pnie n t in Bahrein is being undertaken by the Bahrein Fetroleiim Company (Limited) under a lease granted to the company by the Sheikh of Bahrein on the 29th December, 1934, and modified on the 3rd June, 1936. The lease covers practically the whole of the Island of Bahrein, and runs for a period hLn 7~» Ve / earS from u the 1st January, 1935. Up to the end of 1937 58 wells had been drilled or were about to be drilled, 33 were producing, and 14 were shut-in. I reduction during 1937 amounted to approximately 1,108,894 tons. concesLnarv^-nmn^n^ft^l ' 3 ' n memorandum an agreement between the an assentim? nartv' b-e n S' n ? 8 Government, to which the Ruler concerned is usually ZCtUhfnter^a/af b ‘he company undertakes not to transfer the concession to t,8h ' nterest8 and t0 be « ulded b .v ‘he advice of His Majesty’s Government generally.9. Negotiations in respect of the area belonging to the Sheikh of Bahrein, but not allotted to the Bahrein Petroleum Company in their lease, have been carried on between the sheikh on the one hand and both Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, on the other, but so far without f definite result. 10 The Bahrein Petroleum Company was incorporated in Canada in 1929, the whole of the share capital being subscribed by the Standard Oil Company of California. In 1936 an agreement was reached between the Standard Oil Company and the Texas Corporation, whereby the latter company obtained a half interest in the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As the Texas Oif Corporation has markets in various Eastern countries, this arrangement secures an outlet for the refined products obtained from the refinery recently erected in Bahrein. Qatar. 11. The oil rights in this territory were originally granted to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on the 17th May, 1935. A political agreement was entered into on the 5th June, 1935. The agreement, which runs for a term of seventy-five years, was transferred to Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) (the operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) in Qatar) on the 5th February, 1937. Geological survey work has been carried out and arrangements have been made to commence deep drilling operations in the autumn of 1938. 12. Considerable difficulty has arisen between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government with regard to the boundaries between Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. Ibn Sand claims a frontier which in effect overlaps the limits of the concession held by Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) and indicated in the map attached to the concession. His Majesty’s Government do not admit Ibn Saud’s claim, but have offered him a frontier which, while lying to the south of the Qatar concession boundary, is nevertheless beyond what they regard as the legal limit laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. The Trucial Sheikhdoms. 13. The position in the Trucial States is as follows :— 14 A jman. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) held an option giving them the exclusive right to explore for oil in this territory for a period of two years. The option period expired on the 22nd January, 1938, but the company have so far failed to induce the sheikh to grant an oil concession. 15 Ahu Dhabi. —The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 3rd January, 1938. Negotiations for a concession were recently suspended as the sheikh is proving difficult. 16. Debai. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) hold a concession in respect of this territory for a period of seventy-five years (Commercial Agreement dated the 22nd May, 1937, and Political Agreement dated the 5th February, 1937). No work has so far been carried out. 17. Ras-al-Khaimah. —The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 1st August, 1937. A political agreement, preceding the conclusion of a commercial agreement, was signed on the 25th March, 1938. Negotiations for the latter are in suspense. 18. Sharjah. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) hold a concession in respect of this area for a period of seventy-five years (Commercial Agreement dated the 17th September, 1937; Political Agreement signed the 12th November, 1937). 19. Umm-al-Quwaim. —No option or concession has yet been obtained in respect of this territory, but the sheikh recently informed Petroleum Concessions (Limited) that he was “ willing to negotiate.' Aden Protectorate. 20. An application for an oil exploration licence in respect of this territory has been made by Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and also jointly by the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have priority, and the Protectorate authorities have been recommended to grant that company an exclusive exploration permit for a term of two years, after which the other companies could be given an exclusive permit in respect of the territory not retained by Petroleum Concessions (Limited). A draft of the exploration permit has been agreed between the Colonial Office and the [330 1—1] B 24 company, and sent to the Governor for consideration, in the meantime, 1 etroleum Concessions (Limited) have been given permission to send an expioiation party to the Protectorate (see also note under Muscat and Oman ). Saudi Arabia: (i) Red Sea Area. 21 The petroleum rights in this area were granted to Petroleum Concessions (Limited) on the 9th July, 1936. The concession runs for a period of sixty years and covers the whole of the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia to a depth of 100 kilom. (together with the Farsan and other islands and territorial waters). Prospecting work has been carried out by Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) the local operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) but with the exception of the Farsan Islands and a very small stretch of the coast the results have been disappointing. Saudi Arabia: (ii) Nejd. 22. (a) Hasa .—The oil rights in this area were conceded to the Standard Oil Companv of California by Ibn Saud on the 2/th May, 1933. The con cession has since been transferred to the California Arabian Standuid Oil Company, a subsidiary company, the share capital of which is wholly owned by Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation equally. The concession runs for a period of sixty years. 1 he area of the concession as set out in the relevant article of the concession agreement is as follows : “All of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters), westward to the westerly edge of the Dahana, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia, provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line north, 30 degrees west, to the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana, such boundary shall continue in a straight line south, 30 degrees east, to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia.” 23. Drilling has been carried out by the company and some oil has been found. It has recently been reported that a well giving 3,400 barrels of oil per day has been brought in. Some of the oil from Hasa is being taken to Bahiein for refining. It is also understood that plans for the development of a port on the Hasa coast are under consideration and that the necessary chart will shortly be prepared by the Admiralty on the basis of information supplied by the company as the result of a survey carried out by them. 24. (b) Remainder of Nejd .—The position as regards oil exploration rights in territory of Saudi Arabia not included in the Red Sea area or Hasa aiea concessions, referred to above, is uncertain. It was believed at the time that the Hasa concession agreement had been supplemented by a special agreement or “ secret clause,” giving the Standard Oil Company of California some kind of an option on this territory, but details were lacking. 25. Information has recently been received, however, which points to the probability that on the 29th May, 1933. the Saudi Arabian Government and the company agreed upon a modified form of the concession signed on the 27th May (referred to in paragraph 22), the modifications consisting of the addi tion of two extra articles, numbered respectively 3 and 7, which have been inserted in their appropriate positions in the body of the original agreement of the 27th May, the subsequent articles being appropriately renumbered, and a revised version of the (renumbered) article 35. 26. The effect inter alia of these additional articles (or special agreement) is to accord to the Standard Oil Company of California— “ a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area (i.e., the Hasa concession area) as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations. ' His Majesty’s Government are not at present aware whether or where this “ contact line ’’ has been established. There is presumably an area uncovered by any concession or preference rights between the “ contact line,’' wherever tha may be, and the eastern boundary of the Red Sea concession. 27. shah hav : royalties i received 1 r 28 . ere excl company' Arabia paragrap | companv | to the Si Company Governm Oil Conij provisior The Yem 29. attitude interests ever, bee Yemen f ‘ Muscat c 30.

Dear Mr. Peel, veHen this Company first went concession hunting on the Trucial Coast, it was decided provisionally not to approach the Shaikh of Kalha - who was at that time on the point of 'being recognised by H.M.G. as a separate unit - on the grounds that his territory v/as so situated as to have no oil interest. It does not seem certain, however, that this was a wise decision since Shaikh Khalid, the Regent of Xalba, seems to be a man of some personality who, besides controlling a considerable area of mountain territory, seems to possess influence on the Western side of the mountains also. In tius connection the following passage occurs in a report dated May 10th 1938 from Bahrain 'The R.A. informs me that Khalid, the regent of Kelba, has managed to get Fujairah and Diban under his control. That is to say, they have sworn allegiance to him. This means that practically the whole of the Shamailyah is now depenuent on Kelba. At the same time Wadi A1 Qor and Wadi Helu, sometimes known as Wadi Ham, have both recently paid tax to Khalid, instead of to Sheikh Sultan bin Salem as heretofore. Wadi Helu runs southwards iron Khatt and joins Wadi A1 or in the YiCinity wc st ox continue he might eventually succeed as he io universally liked. I called on Khalid several times/2 times during last Ramadan at A^man, and afterwards cured him of malaria v^ith Atehrin. He seemed a nice type of man and has sent me many messages since then. At the moment it looks as if Ras A1 Khainah territory is now practically halved, Khalid is also friendly with the 3ani Chittah. At the moment H.M.G. are taking no action as regards Khalid’s activities, although they are fully aware of the progress he is making.' I write now to ask: 1. Whether you feel any objection to our approaching the Regent of Kalba in the same manner as other Trueiad rulers if the local situation seems to call for tuis : 2. Whether you have any objection to our approaching* through him, tribes or places which one of the other Qasawim rulers has claimed or may claim, if he offers us mere effective assistance than they: 3. Whether, in your opinion, a concession from the Regent of Kalba can be taken as covering the whole of the Shumaliyah which of course includes Fujairah, Dibah and other villages. As you will perhaps wish to consult your representatives in the Gulf, I am sending a copy of this letter mo our Bahrain Office. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) Stephen H. Longrigg.

Therefore the list of special endorsements required is as follows Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Dutch ast Indies. Furthermore it may be necessary to have special endorsements for Transjordan but the Passport Office will tell you if this is necessary or not. You will also require special endorsements for Arabia. *c believe it is necessary to have separate endorsements for the different parts of Arabia, therefore, you will definitely want one for Bahrein and if you are going there you will also want one for Koweit. For certain of the countries you will also require visas these being as follows Kgypt - 10 gold francs Syria - (obtained at French Legation) 50 francs. Iraq - visa 10 gold flancs. Iran - vis© 8 /- and two photographs are required with application. In some cases medical certificates are also required when applying for visas for Iran. Therefore when you make the necessary application please take this matter up as we do not want any delay to occur on this point. When you arrive in Iran the Police must be notified as to your residence within 48 hours and you have to report personnaly within 8 days to obtain 'permis de r&gt;ejour rt and four photographs are required. Therefore, we have increased the order for photographs from six to twelve copies. You will want also visas costing 10 gold francs each for the various places visited in Arabia and these visas for Arabia are all issued by the British Passport Office. Therefore/Therefore so ff»r as Arabia is concerned, you can settle the whole matter with the British Passport Office both as regards special endorsements and visas. In view of the fact that we have ascertained long delays often occur when applying for visas by post, we really think the quickest way will be for you to first visit the British Passport Office and get the various endorsements together with any visas necessary for Arabia, and then visit the four other Legations concerned i.e. £gypt, France for Syria, Iraq and Iran. In order that the Passport Office shall not query your application for these endorsements we enclose a letter to them signed by the Secretary of this Company stating the purpose of your visit and asking them for every assistance vn your behalf.

Gihson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.V/.l. Dear Gihson, The question of medical and hospital facilities for European and American Staff of the Company in Kuwait has lately 'been under consideration. Le rely, at present, upon the American Mission hut their objects do not, of course, comprise the supply of such facilities as we shall presumably need in the near future, if the numbers of staff in Kuwait continue to increase. It is probable, therefore, that in about two years’ time we shall have to construct our own hospital together with docotor’s and nurses’ quarters at some suitable place near Kuwait town. At present, ho ever, the minimum which coulc. be done in this way would be considerably in excess of our needs, so that the medical staff whom we would have to engage would, to a large extent, be unoccupied. Our general superintendent in Kuwait has discussed the matter with Dr. Mylrea of the American Mission and it has been suggested that we should temporarily convert a convenient house, which we already rent, in^o ^ hOopiu.- for our employees. The Mission would continue to p-ovihe medical services and, in order to handle the extra won., it is proposed that another nurse should be engaged in the United State! for service in Kuwait. The nurse would give/1 2 Pi give us whole-time duty whenever required hut v/ould otherwise he available for work in the Mission' 1 s ‘./omen’s Hospital. We hope to proceed on these lines and to arrange for the nurse to arrive in Kuwait at the end of September. I find it difficult to decide whether she will he an employee of the Mission or of the Company. In either case, the Company will no douht approach II.M.Government for permission, for the nurse to go to Kuwait and for a passport visa. Would you kindly let me know if, in the circumstances, the India Office would facilitate our obtaining these in either of the possible conditions of employment. Yours sincerely, (Sd) H.

W • 1 • Dear V/alton, I he Bhaikh of Kuwait has addressed an enquiry to Directors through Major Holmes as to the Company’s intentions regarding a declaration that petroleum has 'been founo. in commercial quantities and I enclose for your confidential perusal a copy of a letter which it is proposed to send to Holmes on the matter. Is you doubtless know, our relations with the shaikh have always been extremely cordial and the Board are anxious to do everything they can to maintain that happy state of affairs. They would like, therefore, to satisfy the Sheikh by making the declaration as soon as, and if, it is justified by the results of Burgan, No. 3 well. ^ Ji^ey have, however, to consider the incidence of Clause i0 of the agreement between H.M.Government and the Company which requires the letter, when it is satisfied that commercial production is assured, to examine with H.M.G* the question of establishing a refinery in Kuwait. The establishment of a refinery, as you know, involves very large capital expenditure which could only be made if the Company were assured that oil could be produced in Kuwait in large quantities over a long period of years. The two present wells and the third which is being drilled and which it is hoped to bring in shortly could/could not by any means provide such assurance. Moreover, the erection of a refinery in Kuwait has of course to be justified by commeidal conditions quite separate from the volume of production in Kuwait and the anticipated longevity of the field. In the Board’s view, the ’’commercial quantities” of the Concession agreement and the ’’commercial production” and ’’commercial conditions” of the Company/Government agreement ought to be considered independently. If, therefore, they were shortly to make a declaration under the Concession, they would not expect any question under Clause 10 of the Company/ Government agreement to be raised by H.M. Government. After you have had an opportunity of refreshing your memory on the various points raised by this letter, I shoula be glad to hear from you. Yours sincerely, (3gd.) H. KEMP.Major F. Holmes, Mill Hill, Sandon, Chelmsford, ESSEX. Dear Major Holmes, :ith reference to His Highness f letter to you dated ^4th 1 . 03 , I am instructed by Directors to request you to transmit the following observations to His Highness. At all times since the discovery of oil in Kuv/ait at uurgan Ho. 1 well, Directors have been mindful of the provisions of the Concession agreement relating to the aeclaraoion that oil has been found in commercial quantities and were anxious to make this declaration as soon as it was justified by the information obtained from drilling. ^10 you are aware, Durgan Ho. 1 well wns regarded as complete when it had penetrated only 18 feet into the oil reservoir. This action was taken on the sound principle of noc jeopardising a discovery well by further deepening at a time when reservoir conditions are virtually unknown. Burgan No. 2 well was then drilled and, having struck oil, was carried to a considerably greater depth than No.l. In order to obtain information on reservoir conditions, 0 pouroleum engineering examination was made promptly after the discovery of oil in No, 2. Unfortunately, the examination did no 0 provide the data which it had been hoped to obtain because the shales above the oil horizon in No. 2 well caved in and prevented tests being made in that well. In many respects, the information provided by the examination of No. 1 well was satisfactory but it was found that, after the well had been flowed and then closed in, recovering in bottom hole pressure was very slow. Thisfact m ill probably have a considerable influence of production irom the Burgan reservoir and if it confirmed by observation at other wells it may be to drill a much greater number of wells than are on methods is necessar*/ necessary in regions which are not characterised by slow recovery of pressure. v/itn these 1 actors in mind, but realising that His Highness v/oulo. doubtless wish a declaration to be made as soon as possible, Directors had agreed to reconsider the question immediately information from No. 3 well became avallaole * This well is now drilling in the cap rock, ll inch casing will shortly be set and the well will then be c billed into and through the reservoir. If oil is found in this well also, casing will be set throughout the oil sands which will be tested from the bottom upwards by gun perl oration. Directors are satisfied that this procedure is the oost that can be adopted for the development of the oil resources of His Highness* territory. Directors wish me to stress that the procedure for N°. 3 well outlined above will be carried out with all expedition. It is their great hope that the results of the drilling and examination of the well, taken in conjunction with infformation already obtained, will enable them to make a declaration that oil has been found in commercial quantities in the near future.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. 1 &gt;’ . t Department. ■ ' ' Confid^nUt IMPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL). rjj g.—fAii is an ORIGINAL message sent by AIR MAIL which provides a means of communication more expeditious than the ordinary mail and is cheaper than the telegraph.

It is true that under that Agreement the Company agree to examine with rl.M.G. the question of establishing a refinery if and when they are 'satisfied that commercial production is assured'. Jut under the Article the Company only declare their intention to erect a refinery 'should they consider that commercial conditions justify it'. The drilling of three wells, which is all that has taken place so far, represents in effect only a very early stage of the development of the field and it may be some time before the refinery question becomes a live issue. I think it is arguable that the Company’s declaration under the Commercial Agreement is a trifle premature but I do not feel that justifies us in raising the refinery question. 4.

According to that correspondence the generally recognised view with regard to areas outside territorial waters is that the sea-bed and the sub-soil beneath it is res nullius . but that it is capable of acquisition by effective occupation in the same manner as any unoccupied territory above the level of the sea, tfris basis the Sheikh could presumably be regarded as having only potential rights in such areas and could expect no support from His Majesty’s Government in respect of them un vl they had been made actual as the result of effective occupation, and the Company could only negotiate for a concession in respect of such rights as the Sheikh mayji ereaft e r acquire in the area which is marked in the chart and is not already covered by the existing concession. But we should be glad of your views as to the reply it would be desirable to send to Kemp on questions (a) and (b). ^ 3. It may be that there is no answer to question (c) that would be universally accepted, but prima facie , . ’ and/and subject to any information bearing on the point v/hich we may receive from the authorities in the Persian Gulf, it wou seem reasonable to regard Kov/eit bay as a territorial inlet. 4. I am sending a similar letter to Jarrett and Starling. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) R. PERU4603/39. Kuwait Oil Company ? Limited, Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, London, E.C.2. 25th July, 1939. J.P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. Dear Gibson, Further to my letter of today's date, I think it might be useful if, in the course of the present inquiry, you could give us a ruling on the extent of Kuwait territorial waters. I presume that for the most part the limit of territorial waters lies three nautical miles from low water mark around the mainland and around all islands appertaining to Kuwait. With regard to Kuwait Bay, as this is virtually a land-locked harbour, having all its shores within Kuwait territory, I imagine that the limit of territorial waters in this region would not lie closer inshore than three nautical miles beyind a line joining the two headlands at the entrance to the Bay. I can, however, find no clear ruling on this issue in the available text books. Yours &amp;c. (Sd.) H.T.Kemp.P.Z. 4603/39. KUWAIT OIL COMPANY, LI ITED, Britannic House, iinsLury Circus, London, E.C.2. 25th July, 1939. J.P. Gibson, Esq.., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. Dear Gibson, With reference to our conversation on 19th July, the following is the resume of the subject which Walton asked me to send for consideration. On 25th April, 1939, Major Prank Holmes, the London Representative of H.H. the Shaikh of Kuwait with the Kuwait Oil Company, called on me and proposed that the Company should acquire from H.H. an oil concession covering an area lying beyond the territorial v/aters of Kuwait and bounded by a line which he indicated on a chart. I am forwarding under separate cover two copies of a photostat showing the area concerned. Major Holmes’ proposal was considered by Directors, and I wrote to him on 6th July and received a further letter from him dated 10th July. Copies of these letters are enclosed. We should be obliged if His Majesty’s Government would give us a ruling on the following points (a) what exclusive and non-exclusive rights has H.H. the power to grant in the form of an oil concession over the area indicated. (b) if such rights can be granted, would H.M. Government have any objection to negotiations for, and conclusion of, a Concession agreement between H.H. and the Company. Yours, etc. (Sd. ) H.T.Kemp.H.T. Kemp, Esq., Kuwait Oil Co. Ltd. , Britannic House, E.C.2. Dear Mr. Kemp: I have to thank you for your letter dated 6th July, 1939. it appears to me that some confusion has arisen in respect of the status of the area which I indicated to you on the couv of the Chart Ho. 2837.B. Before commenting on your letter, I would like to make it clear that His Highness has always been most anxious that the terms and rights granted in the Kuwait Oil Concession he honoured meticulously both in letter and spirit and has impressed upon me that nothing should occur to disturb the pleasant relations that have always existed between His Highness and the Company. The Area which I pointed out on the Chart mentioned above does not include any portion of the 'Territorial Haters' of either the Mainland or the Islands belonging to the State of Kuwait. The whole of this area is situated outside the limit of 3.45 statute miles (3 nautical miles) from high water mark which distance (3.4-5 miles) is the Internationally recognised limit of 'Territorial Haters'. In other words the area under discussion is 'International Haters' and His s is fully aware that such is the Status of the Area. Highne His Highness has made no move, either officially or otherwise in respect of the area in question, except to make a private enquiry, through me, from your Company as to whether your Board would be interested in such an area. The position in respect of 'International Haters' situated opposite to Territory adjacent to the Arabian Coast, - but excluding that opposite to Kuwait - has changed considerably of recent months, I understand that a large area, the greater portion of which is International Haters, has been offered to an American Oil Company by His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrein. This action in respect of 'International Haters' may draw the attention of other Rulers along the Arabian Coast and naturally they may wish to protect, as far as possible, oil rights over International Haters lying adjacent to their respective Territories and may possibly do so on the same lines as Bahrein. I am sending a copvy of this letter to His Highness by the same mail that takes to him your letter of the 6th July. Yours sincerely, (S gd.) FRANK HOLMES.&lt;n Z i 6th July, 1939. Major P. Holmes, Millhill, Sandon, Essex. Dear Major Holies, You will remember that on 25th April you asked me to consult Directors on the question of the acquisition by the Company from H.H. the Shaikh of Kuwait of rights over an area covered by the sea which you had indicated on a copy of chart No. 28373. As you are aware, the Company’s Concession agreement gives it the exclusive right to explore, search, drill for, produce and will petroleum within the State of Kuwait, including all islands and territorial waters appertaining thereto. The phrase ’’territorial waters” was deemed to include all submarine areas over which His Highness has authority in any form, and, therefore, all areas over which His Highness could grant rights to any party. The intention, therefore, of the concessionary provision - in the opinion of Directors and doubtless also in that of His Highness - was to give the Company the above exclusive right over all areas which lay within the gift of His Highness. Directors would be glad if you would convey this expression of views to His Highness, and would be ..pleased to learn His Highness’s further opinions on the matters concerned. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) H.T. Kemp.P.Z. 5999/39. S,77.1 n 29th September, 1939. Dear Kemp ? Would you please refer to your letters of'the 21st June and the SOth/June on the question of the production of oil m it owe it in commercial quantities. it is noted that wajor nolmes has been authorised to intimate to the Sheikh the Company's hope that they will he enabled in the near future to make a declaration that oil has been found in commercial quantities. I am desired to say that His Majesty’s Government do not propose to raise the refinery question at this stage although they attach considerable importance to it and will 5 of course ? raise it if and when the oil field develops.
