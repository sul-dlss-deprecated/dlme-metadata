(2) For the purpose of the trial of a person for an offence against such Regulations by Court Martial, and the punishment thereof, the -__person may be proceeded against and dealt with as if he were a person 'abject to Military or Air Force Law and had on active service com mitted an offence under Section 5 of the Army Act or Section 5 of the Air Force Act.

(4) Any provision of any law of the Territory other than an Act of Parliament expressly or by necessary implication extending thereto which may be inconsistent with any Regulation made by the Governor under this Article shall be suspended and of no effect during the con tinuance of such Regulation. V.

(6) The Governor may direct that all the resources of any railway in the Territory shall be placed at his disposal for any purpose which he considers necessary in connection with the defence of the Territory, and no liability whatever shall be incurred on account of any interference with the regular traffic which may thus be occasioned. (7) The Governor may prohibit the export from the Territory of any article, and may seize and take possession of any grain, article of food, coal or other fuel, and mineral oils, within the limits of the Territory, and may sell at such prices as may be determined by the. Board hereinafter mentioned, or, if the emergency is such as to render it inexpedient in his opinion to wait for the price to be assessed by the Board, may himself fix the selling price and sell any grain, article of food, coal, fuel, and oils, so seized and taken. The moneys to be received for such sales shall be paid into the Treasury of the Territory. f (8) The Governor may, by Proclamation, prescribe the maximum price for which any article of food may be sold by retail, and any person who, after such Proclamation, and until it shall have ceased to be in operation, shall sell any article of food at a higher price than the price so prescribed, shall be deemed guilty of an offence against this Article, and shall, on conviction thereof, be liable to a fine not exceeding £50 or an equivalent sum in the case of a Territory having a silver currency, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months. (9) The Governor may take any steps he may consider necessary in the interests of the defence of the Territory for controlling the trade in beer, wine or spirits. (10) The Governor shall, out of the public funds of the Territory, pay to every person who shall be required to do any personal service by virtue of this Article such remuneration, and to every person whose property shall be taken, including any grain, article of food, coal or other fuel and mineral oils taken by virtue of paragraph (7) of this Article, or temporarily taken possession of or removed or destroyed by virtue of this Article, such compensation as shall be agreed on between the Governor and such person, and, in default of agreement, such remuneration or compensation as shall be awarded by the Board hereinafter mentioned. (11) For the purpose of determining the amount of any remuneration or compensation payable under this Article, and the prices at which any grain, article of food, coal, or other fuel and mineral oils taken under paragraph (7) of this Article may be sold, the Governor shall5 appoint a Board consisting of five persons, of whom one shall be a Judge or Stipendiary Magistrate, two shall be officers either in the service of the Civil Government of the Territory or in His Majesty’s Naval, Military or Air Service, and the other two shall be inhabitants of the Territory. All questions referred to the said Board shall, in case of a difference of opinion, be decided by the votes of the majority ^j^he members. The Judge or Stipendiary Magistrate shall be the Chairman of the Board. The decision of award of the Board shall in all cases be final. (12) The said Board, in fixing the price to be paid for articles taken under paragraph (7) of this Article, shall not make any addition on account of the purchase being compulsory, and they shall fix the prices at which such articles shall be sold at such rates as will, except under special circumstances, recoup to the Government the cost of purchasing the same, and other expenses incidental thereto. (13) Any person authorised by the Governor in writing in that behalf may enter upon and into any ship or vessel, land, house or other building, in the Territory, and examine and inspect any such ship or vessel and its cargo and contents whatsoever or such land or building and everv or any part thereof and, in case of opposition or obstruction, may use force to effect such entry, examination, and inspection, and shall not be liable for any damage directly or indirectly occasioned by such forcible entry. (14) Every person who refuses or neglects to obey or comply with any order or requisition made under this Article, or does anything whereby the execution of any such order or requisition is prevented or hindered, or with intent to prevent or hinder the execution of any such order or requisition, shall be guilty of an offence against this Article, and shall, on summary conviction thereof, be liable to a fine not less than 40s. and not more than £10, or equivalent sums in the case of a Territory having a silver currency, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month. (15) If any person shall, by obeying any order or requisition made under this Article, be prevented from fulfilling any contract, such person shall not be deemed to have thereby committed a breach of contract, but such contract shall be deemed to be suspended by such order or requisition so far as its fulfilment is thereby rendered impos sible. (16) The Governor may by Proclamation postpone for such period as he may think necessary or just and expedient, the time at which any rent or other moneys shall become due and payable, and particu- larlv may so extend the period of maturity of bills or other negotiable instruments payable in the Territory, and may suspend for such time as he may think right the execution of the judgment of any Court of Civil Judicature, and the enforcement of any process of evictment or other process for the recovery of the possession of property in default of payment of rent, if he shall consider that, owing to circumstances arising out of the State of War or the immediate apprehension of War,the immediate execution of such judgments or enforcement of such process would be inequitable or inexpedient. (17) The Governor may, if he thinks fit, delegate to the ISfaval, Military or Air Authorities in the Territory any of his powers under this Article. VI. Paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of Article V of this Order shall r apply to any person in His Majesty’s Naval, Military or Air Service, nor shall paragraphs (4), (5), (6), (7) or (13) apply to ships or vessels or to any other property belonging to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, to the Secretary of State for War, or to the Secretary of State for Air. VII.

The point at issue is whether the regulations for issue ( on the outbreak of war^ under the Aden Defence scheme to govern matters such as censorship, arrest, control of foodstuffs/&lt;- ( should be issued by the Resident under authority given by an Order in Council, or by the Resident under powers granted by the Governor-General of India or the Indian legislature* The question was previously considered in 1928 (see P.982/28 below) when it was agreed that the inclusion of Aden for the purposes now under consideration in a Schedule to an Order in Council relating to the defence of certain British colonies was undesirable so long as Aden remained part of British India. 2. The matters affected are of course essentially matters which are the concern of the civil administratio The civil administration continues to be an Indian responsibility; and the Aden settlement remains, as in 1928, in law part of British India. The only question is whether the situation has in any way been \/ti &amp;*-) changed by the Government of India Act of 1929, under which the military control of Aden was transferred from the Governor General in Council to the Resident and Commander in Chief 'who, is in the exercise thereof, required to pay due obedience to all such orders as he may receive from a Secretary of State** (Government of India (Aden) Order in Council 1929). Will you be so kindkind as to advise whether in your view the Act and Order in Council of 1929 in any way alter the situation or whether the position remains as in 1928? If the position remains as in 1928, and the necessary orders can only he issued hy the Governor General in Council or the Resident acting under powers delegated hy him, would Indian legislation he required to authorise their issue, or is there any less cumbrous method of proceeding? A precisely similar situation must I imagine exist in respect of the remainder of British India, and there are presumably powers (other than the emergency powers under Section 72 of the Government of India Act) under which the Governor General in Council can bring into force emergency orders etc. immediately on the outbreak of war? If legislation is necessary, the simplest practical procedure would appear to be to ~ — ~ arrange(with the Government of India that action on the lines desired shall be taken under Section 72 of the Act immediately on the outbreak of war, the requisite legislative action being taken subsequently? * ,4 ' * % t Exercise of emergency powers in the Protectorate. 4. Please see on this the Air Ministry’s letter of 16th June now atta ched, The position in regard to the exercise of jurisdiction in the Aden Protectorate is described in the note the Judicial Assistant at Aden, P.7/29 flagged below. Such jurisdiction as is exercised in that area is exercised under the35a 3000 5 31 Minute Paper. Department. Indian Foreign Jurisdiction Order in Council of 1902 through the Governor General of India in Council. You will remember that we considered at an earlier stage whether it might not be desirable to transfer jurisdiction in the Protectorate to His Majesty’s Government, (see P.4413/28 flagged) and that it was ultimately decided that serious inconvenience was likely to arise if matters were left as they were. The necessary alteration could, however, presumably be made with little difficulty and delay in the event of a situation so developing in war time as to render this desirable ? L tc tbs £dec Laws hegulsticc Ibck^is still in the same posi tion as any other part of 'British India' for the purposes now in question. If on the outbreak of war it beeanoe necessary to issue regulations of tne kind suggested legislative authority would have to be obtained. Such authority Eight be obtained by Eeaas of an Ordinance of the Governor General under section 72 of the Govt of India Act or a Regulation under section 71 of the ^ct or an Act of the Indian legislature. An Ordinance as you know remains in force for six months only.On the cut- break of the Great Aar we proceeded first by Ordinance and then by ordinary legislation.

In fact the Governor General in Council has acted under this A Order in respect of the Aden Protectorate. I cannot say what powers the Crown has in this Protectorate but these papers shew that the jurisdiction exercised has been of a very mild kind. 6 . 3 \ [b-AAjL*— ^ lt£y - CK&gt; &amp; L+-Aa*s ^-tisT VA^vjCc^ ^ ^ Ar&lt;-4r l \sjar4~ ttu± Xfct* C^4&gt;va_c_ ^ 1/3- (s&gt;uitt~ZAy/^k I should not go cut of my way to recommend a Regulation. xtxEE 8828 X An Ordinance is issued by tne Governor General but a Regulation is issued by tne Governor General in Ccuncit At present there is no difficulty about getting a Regulation issued but we do not know what Authority will nave the power to issue Regulations in future.

P.i&amp;zfe# ^ /f?7' CZ/wy ) My dear Evans, I write with reference to your d. ©.letter of 26th May to Cowell about the Aden Defence Scheme to se^y that we have now examined the points involved. 2. I enclose a copy of a note by Sir Edward Chamier which I think makes the position clear. The legislation of 1929 made no altera tion in the status of the Aden Settlement which remains as before part of British India. This being so, the same objections as were stated by us in 1928 would hold good to the issue of regulations of the type now under consideration save by an Indian authority. 3. As you will see. Sir Edward Chamier advises that the necessary authority might be obtained either by an Ordinance of the Governor General under Section 72 of the Governmait of India Act, or by a Regulation under Section 71, or by an Act of the Indian Legislature. We should, of course, need to be able to act at once in regard to the issue of the regulations on the outbreak of war, and in view of the 5000 1.32 delay/delay which might he involved we may, I think, dismiss action by means of an Act of the Indian Legislature. If you agree as to this, the alternatives open to us would be to arrange for the issue of the regulations either under an Ordinance or by a Regulation .. An ordinance under Section 72 of the Goverrment of India Act would remain in force for six months only* During that period arrangements could be made to secure the necessary authority by an Act of the Indian A Legislature, and as we understand that emergency action in respect of the rest of India would probably be taken under Section 72, no difficulty need be anticipated in securing this. j^B-u t a possibly simpler alternative in the case of Aden, would be action by the issue of a regulation under Section 71 of the Act. Such a regulation, once made by the Governor General in Council would remain in force for whatever period might be provided (e.g. duration of war) and would not require to be renewed or replaced^ 4. jjRfhichever method you think preferable (the final decision wouldj of course have to rest with the Government of Indiaj'the best course/€17 5000 1.32 General/ Draft Paper Department the best course would appear to be that you should send us a precise statement of the regulations the Dr^desire, that we should send these to the Government of India, and that we should ask them to intimate that they would be prepared immediately on the outbreak of war or in such other events as difficulty or delay if an arrangement of this nature were brought into being. 5. The preceding paragraph deals with the question of the Aden Settlement. The Aden Protectorate is of course in a different position. You have already had a full statement of the legal position in regard to the Protectorate and the Acts which have jurisdiction as is exercised in it at the present time is exercised under the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction^ Order in Council of 1902, of which I enclose copies, through the Governor mi ght ne c e s s it at o Commissioner at Aden by an Ordinance under Section 72, or to approve the authorise issue issu^ of a Regulation under Section 74-*-/ There would be no risk of been made applicable to it. SuchGeneral of India in Council. You will remember that we considered at an earlier stage whether it might not be desirable to transfer jurisdiction in the Protectorate to H.M.G.^and that it was ultimately decided that no serious inconvenience was likely to arise if matters were left as they were. I do not imagine that any very serious problem is likely to be presented by the Protectorate at any rate immediately on the outbreak of war; and the necessary transfer of jurisdiction could, I imagine, be arranged with little difficulty or delay in the event of the situation making this desirable. Action would presumably be by the cancellation of the Order of 1902, and the issue of a fresh order conferring such jurisdiction as the Imperial Government thought necessary. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Cowell. If, after reading it,?you would like to discuss the matter further with the assistance of the Colonial Office, perhaps you would let me know. J. G.

INDIA OFFICE^COPY. ’’AIR*MINISTRY, t ! r i ^ } Adastral House, J V v:: A Kingsway, W.C.2. 26th May, 1932. My dear Cov/ell, As you are yrobahly av/are a Defence Scheme for Aden is in course of preparation and the draft has heen circulated to the members of the Oversea Defence Committee. 7 e are in some doubt as to the basis on which would rest the provisions as to censorshi ), arrest, deportation, control of foodstuffs, etc; and in general those various powers which would correspond to those provided by D. C. R. A. in this country. T'hen the Defence Order in Council was made in May, 1928, there was some suggestion that Aden should be included in its application. The India Office, however, then sop res sed the view that if the Resident was to be empowered to issue regulations of that type it was preferable that he should do so in exercise of authority conferred by Indian legislation and that so long as ret.' Ired legally part India there would be strong objection to the application to it of the Defence Order in Council. It was urged by the India Office that in case of emergency the Governor General of India would deal with the situation by the issue of an Ordinance under Section 72 of the Government of India Act (see Colonial Office letter to Air Ministry of May 3rd, 1928, reference 50184/28). Since then the situation has been changed by the enactment of the Government o ^ India' (Aden) Act, 1929 and by the subsequent R. COl'ELL rr Sd. , C. ..G. Colonial Office,subsequent S.R. and 0. made thereunder (lTo.977 of 1929), whereby the superintendence, direction and control of the military government of \den, including every dependency of den, was transfer ed to and vested in the Resident and Commander-in-Chief at Aden. I am not clear, however, (and .anyhow it would be a matter for the legal experts of the Colonial Office and the India Office to determine) whether the Government oi India (Aden) Act makes it possible and practicable to apply to .‘den the Defence Order in Council: or whether it is still necesr ry, or at least preferable in view of the bearing of the emergency powers upon the working of the civil government at Aden, to base them on some authority conferred ^y Inaian legislation a', this is the ca e, we shall be glad to be advised as to what authority exists for the purpose. I see that the powers taken under Section 72 of the government of India Act would only be operative for six months.

The Government of India's proposal should O \^ meet all normal difficulties, but I am doubtful whether it will satisfy the Colonial Office, What they have in mind is an emergency arising at Aden through an unheralded air attack, in which event al' - o £ Kules would have to be brought into force without either a Warning or a War Telegram. In these circumstances the few hours which would elapse while Aden and India are exchanging telegrams might be important. 2. I therefore suggest that we should not commit ourselves to supporting the Government of India until we have the Colonial Office views. Personally, I much prefer our suggestion for retrospective legislation as being more adaptable to circumstances which we cannot foresee.

InblA GrriLm2621 6000 3 31 legislation/' * C f. e Minute Paper. political Department. It is necessary for the Chief Commissioner at Aden, under the Aden Defence Scheme, to issue certain rules on receipt of the War Telegran. These rules are the General Defence Rules, Aliens Restriction Rules, Safeguarding of Economic Security Rules, Safeguarding of Financial Security Rules, Aerial Defence Rules and Censorship Rules. It is possible that the Censorship Rules would have to be brought into effect^on instructions from before the issue of the V/ar telegram. The Chief Commissioner has at present no powers to issue these rules and it has been envisaged that such pa/ers would be provided by the issue of a Regulation under Section 71 or an Ordinance under Section 72 of the Government of India Act. Action was, however, postponed on account of the impending separation of Aden from India. 2. In view of the present emergency, we have suggested to the Government of India that they should prepare a drait Regulation or Ordinance (the Chief Commissioner has expressed a preference for a Regulation). There is, however, a possibility that the necessity for publishing the rules would come so suddenly that there might be an interval between this moment and the publication by the Government of India of their Regulation. The Colonial Liiice take the view that the Regulation should be issued now. There might, however, be political difficulty m taking powers at this particular moment^which would be obviously designed to deal with a war with Italy. The Committee of Imperial Defence, in a recent report, envisage that there might even be difficulty in enacting2 . legislation during the Vanning period, A possible solution would be for the Government of India to issue their Regulation after the receipt of the V/ar ‘telegram and mak&amp;a^f it validate rules previously made by the Chief Commissioner as well as enabling him to make further rules. This suggestion has been put demi-officially to the Colonial Office already, but for reasons which appear to be somev/hat ill-conceived they do not like it. I should be grateful if you could say whether you concur in the attached draft letter to the Colonial Office and draft telegram to the Government of India.

OCT 1/ jf-V 'VY LETTER v - 1 KjE I am directed by s/s for I. to refer to C.O. letter No.6214/14/35 of 11th October, regarding the arrangements for bringing into force the Rules under the Aden Defence Scheme, and to connected d.o.correspondence between the C.O. and the 1.0. on this subject. 2. The Marquess of Zetland recognises that it is essential that the Chief Commissioner at Aden should not be under the necessity of withholding issue of the Rules after the moment when they are required, merely because he has not received intimation from the G.of I. that they have made the Regulation under Section 71 of the G.of I. Act 3761 5000 5.55 He is, however, reluctant for the reasons set out in I.0.telegram to the G.of I., No.3178 of 6th October, to ask the G.of I. to make a Regulation of this type at the present moment, without the concurrence of the S/S for F.A. having first been obtained. A Regulation under Section 71 of the G.of I. Act is brought into force by its publication in the Gazette of India and it would therefore be likely to come to the knowledge of the Italian Government. It would moreover be obvious that the emergency/SJ emergency with which the Regulation was u&gt;&lt;*$ designed to deal with that of war between H.M.G. and Italy and Lord Zetland envisages the possibility of its publication being misinterpreted by the Italian Government. H.L.notes, moreover, that in the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the C.I.D. dated 8th October 1935 (Paper H0.1190-B) it is pointed out that it might be of the greatest importance to avoid publicity. The actual legislation required to give cover to the Rules in question at Aden cannot, for the reasons explained above, be enacted without publicity and presumably it may be «/ desiraole to avoid this until the War 'telegram or at any rate the Warning u 'telegram is issued. There upo n the necessary legislation^v/hich requires only a decision by the G.G.in C. ; could at once be enacted, as the Regulation required will already have beendrafted, couV^. and ean be promulgated forthwith. There is thus little reason to fear that there would be any appreciable delay in the Chief Commissioner's notification of the Rules. But in Lord Zetland’s opinion the risk of any such delay can be entirely eliminated in the following manner. 3. In His Lordship’s view it is unnecessary that the Regulation should be actually promulgated prior to the issue of the Rules. He suggests that the Regulation should so be drafted as I to /3761 5000 5.05 5./ * Draft Paper. Department. to validate Rules already made by the Chief Commissioner^ and acts done under them, as well as authorise him to make Rules. The Chief Commissioner could then issue his Rules as soon as such action was required under the Aden Defence Scheme, without the necessity 01 waiting for the actual promulgation of the Regulation. If the Rules were in fact issued before the publication of the Regulation they v/ould subsequently be validated by the G.of l*s Regulation. The G.of I. and the Chief Commissioner would no doubt consider whetherthis procedure necessitates any amendment of the introductory words of the draft Rules printed in Appendix VII (A) and VII(B) of the Aden Defence Scheme. that any difficulty would arise on this point. 4. Copy is enclosed of a draft telegram which Lord Zetland would propose to send to the G.of I. and repeat to the Chief Commissioner at Aden^if the S/S for the Colonies in the light of the explanations contained in this letter, concurs in its terms. This draft differs slightly from that sent to the C.O. in Mr. Clauson’s d.©.letter of ! llth October. Lord Zetland does not h ov/ever anticipateUBmUR.'WJlI.PWIWWMI^W 5. With reference to para.2 of the C.O.letter of 11th October under reference, Lord Zetland observes that according to the text of the Acien Defence Scheme the Chief Commissioner would bring into force the Rules under Appendix Yll(A) and VII(B) of that *&lt; Scheme, not on receipt of the Warning Telegram but on receipt of the War Telegram. The Censorship Rules would be a possible exception.

There is no question of 'shortness of precautionary stage or other reasons.' We do not see why there need be any real difficulty about the issue of a regulation immediately. The Government of India regulation need only empower the Commissioner to make rules 'on an emergency occurring'.

S i ^ rJ'-&gt; '1 You have probably seen the Aden Defence Scheme which was circulated by the Secretary, Oversea Defence Committee, under a covering note dated October 5th (O.D.C. No:853). We notice that the Resident has included under Chapter VII draft regulations covering general defence requirements to provide for the control of aliens etc.; six regulations in all, in addition to the draft proclamation for Marshal Law; Control of Supplies and for the Treatment of Neutral and Enemy Ships. So far as I can see, these are in order. The Resident (or, as he should be called for this purpose, the Chief Commissioner) had no doubt before him precedents taken from other similar Regulations. I do not know the source of these precedents. Do you, and do you agree that the India Office is primarily responsible for scrutinising them? As regards the sanctions on which the Defence Rules etc.,J would rest, I infer from the Acting Resident’s letter of July 12th, -that you have not yet had the Government of India's observations i /inmm in reply to the letter which Walton sent to Metcalfe on September 1st, 1932* This, however, presumably need not prevent the form of the regulations being approved if they are in themselves satisfactory.

Please see previous submission on P.Z.4583/32 flagged and the G.of I. 1 s reply. I should be grateful for your observations, particularly as regards the question of jurisdiction in the Aden Protectorate. I If the statementein para.4 of the G.of I.'s letter are correct it would appear that the Protectorate, while not British (or British Indian) territory, was .technically part of India up to the date of the Aden Order in Council of 1929 and this may be of some importance in dealing with possible queries iniespect of military expenditure from Indian revenues in the Protectorate prior tcf that date. / 4ilx I have always been rather hazy about the position in the Aden ’Protectorate' as rry previous notes shew. I was not aware that the Crown exercised suzerainty over the Aden Protectorate similar to that exercised over the States in India proper. Indeed I was under the impression that (see my note of the 8th January 1929 in P.3082/1917) that there must have been a declaration by the Crown under para 2 of the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council 1002. The treaties with the Sultan of Lahej in 'Aitchison' seem to leave him in a position somewhat different from that of the other Chiefs in the Protec torate. I suppose however that what Mr Metcalfe says in paras 4 and 5 1212 5(, CO 9.32U ^ of his letter of the 24th November 1932 is correct and if so lagree with his conclusion in para 6 that the Governor General in Council has ceased to exercise jurisdiction over the /V Protectorate on behalf of Bis Majesty and that for the future any necessary provision for the exercise of such jurisdictiop as Bis Majefety possesses there should be made by Orders in Council made directly by His Majesty in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act 1890.*\ Secret.

P.Z.4583/32, dated the 1st September, 1932, regarding action to be taken by the Chief Commissioner, Aden on the outbreak of war, or in other times of emergency. 2. So far as the Aden Settlement is concerned, it is in the opinion of the Government of India beyond question that legisla tion empowering the Chief Commissioner at Aden to make regula tions within the sphere of the civil government of the British Indian province of Aden (Schedule A to the Aden Laws Regulation, 1932) should be enacted by an authority competent to legislate for Aden under the Government of India Act. These authorities are t- (1) the Indian Legislature, which is competent to legislate specifically for Aden under section 65, (2) The Governor General in Council, who is competent to make regulations for Aden under section 71; f or (3) The Governor General, who is competent to make Ordinances/ Aden under section 72. 3. The first of these three alternative processes is of course inappropriate for the enactment of emergency legislation of the character in view; but the second is not materially more dilatory than the third and since a regulation, unlike an ordinance, has no time limit set upon its operation, it might not improbably prove convenient to proceed ab initio by way ofi of regulation rather than by way of Ordinance. The Government of India, therefore, while agreeing that the action indicated in paragraph 5 of your letter would be appropriate, would prefer to leave open the question whether the necessary legislation should, on occasion arising for its enactment, take the form of a regulation under section 71 or an Ordinance under section 72. They will take up the preparation of the draft rules to be in the possession of the Chief Commissioner Aden for promulgation under the regulation or Ordinance in the event of the emergency arising. 4. As regards paragraph 6 of your letter, the supposition that jurisdiction in the Aden Protectorate is now exercised under the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council and the proposal that it should continue to be so exercised appear to the Government of India to overlook the necessary consequences of the transfer of political control of the Protectorate from the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government. When political control was exercised by the Government of India the Protectorate was, by virtue of the exercise of that control by the Government of India in India as defined in section 18(5) of the Interpreta tion Act and therefore, within the limits of the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council under the opening part of section 2 read with section 6 thereof. With the change frcm the exercise of political control through the Government of India to the direct exercise of political control by His Majesty’sMajesty’s Government, the Protectorate ceased automatically to be in India and ceased automatically to be included within the limits of the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council. Its reinclusion within those limits by way of declaration under the latter part of section 2 of the Order, to the possibility of which Sir Edward Chamier alludes, would it is suggested involve a revocation of the decision, which we understood is immutable, that the political control of the Protectorate should be exercised directly by His Majesty’s Government. 5. The hypothesis that jurisdiction in the Protectorate is now exercised under the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council appears to rest on the notifications issued there under which were set out on pages 400-402 of Volume IV of the 3rd Edition of Macpherson’s British Enactments and to which reference is made in paragraph 2 of the Colonial Office letter dated the 29th September 1928. The position, however, is that these notifications were validly issued when the Protectorate was within the limits of the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council and that while they may remain in force de facto and may arguably remain in force de .jure with the status of orders made directly under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, they ceased, on Aden ceasing to be included within the limits of the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council, to remain in force in the character of notifica tions issued under that Order. Consequently, theI' U'fy 2 £. c , • the notifications in question were not reproduced in the 4th edition of Macpherson. 6. In our opinion, then, the position is that with the transfer of political control it became and remains impossible to exercise jurisdiction in the Protectorate by way of orders I made by the Governor General in Council under,the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council. It would appear to follow that any necessary provision for the exercise of such jurisdiction as His Majesty possesses in the Protectorate must be made through the medium of Orders in Council made directly for the Aden Protectorate by His Majesty in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890.

Uvr*** h* * Downing Street, My dear Laithwaite, Since I wrote to you on the 15th June enclosing a copy of ■Svans* letter aoout the Aden Defence Scheme, I have been looking into the question of the possibility of making provision in the Aden Protectorate for censorship and the other matters with which Evans* letter deals. You will remember that at the discussion which took place on the 15th you told us that the Government of India would not be likely to raise any objection to the issue of an Order-in-council making provision for such matters in the Protectorate, and, if necessary, would not object to the repeal of the Orders issued by the Governor General in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. I J.G.LAITHWAITE,ESQ. —I have not been able to ascertain exactly what is the position in this regard in the Protectorate, but it is explained in general terms in the despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Acting Resident dated the 29th of September, 1928, of which you doubtless have a copy in our Office Print Middle East No.22. Reference is made in that despatch to Orders issued m a Foreign Department notification printed in Macpherson* s 'British EnactInents ,, Volume 4, but our Library have not been able to obtain a copy of those Orders, although I understand that they have applied to the India Office Library.- If you can be good enough to obtain for us copies of the Orders bearing on the matter, we shall be in a better position to consider to what extent repeal or amendment is necessary if it should be decided to issue an Order-in-Council for the Aden Protectorate on the general lines of 'The Defence (Certain-&gt; ^ • lb / 4 ; q ^ o a.

I have also received a copy of Evans* letter to you of the 29th July. As far as the Settlement is concerned the questions at issue now lie between the India Office and the Air Ministry, and we are not involved. As regards the Protectorate, if it can be stated that adequate powers exist under the Indian (Poreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council, 1902, we should see no reason for making additional provision in anticipation of any emergency. We are, however, in some doubt as to the J.G. LAITHWAI extent of the powers given by the Order in Council. ItIt appears to delegate to the Governor-General powers and jurisdiction which His Majesty enjoys * , hy treaty, grant, usage, sufferance, and other lawful means. M Can the India Office take the responsibility of saying that under these powers the regulations required for the purposes of the Defence Scheme could be enforced in the Protectorate? If they can, we have no reason to object to the procedure. Yours sincerely, Jf-- &lt;35 - .Register No. ?Z^S$3 3Z .SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT I jetter Telegrrrm from Dated ajf Rec.

As the result of examination here the Secretary of State indicated that if the Resident at Aden was to be empowered to issue regulations of the type in question it was preferable that he should do so in the exercise of authority conferred upon him by Indian legislation and that so long as Aden remained legally part of India there would be strong objection to any proposal that he should be so authorized under an Order in Council applying to parts of/of the Jiinpire under the direct control of the Home Government. We added that in an emergency it would always he open to the Governor-General to deal with the situation hy the issue of an ordinance under Section 72 of the Government of India Act. Copies of the correspondence were sent to the Government of India in the Political Secretary’s weekly letter of 15th torch 1928. 2. In 1929 Section 33 of the Government of India Act was amended so as to remo-ve the superintendence, direction, and control of the Military ^overnnent of Aden from the Governor-General md to transfer 44; to an authority to he specif ied v (Inder the Aden Order in Council of 1929it. •5he authority specified order was the Resident, who was however required in the exercise of the powers so transferred 'to pay due obedience to all such orders as he may receive from a Secretary of state.' 3.

The suggestion U Cr&lt;^ therefore/tentatively made by the Air Ministry that the case would be met were the Government of India to undertake that they would, immediately on the outbreak of war, or in such other event as might necessitate bringing the requisite powers into operation, issue an Ordinance corresponding in terms as closely as possible to those of the Defence (pertain British possessions) Order in Council,1928,of which I enclose a copy. (I ought incidentally to add that thib Order is treated as Secret, although it is not so marked). 5. We should he v-e-ry grateful if the Government of India would let us know vtoether they see any objection to action on these lines; and whether they would he prepared! to agree to take the action in question in the events described. If they see difficulty in doing so perhaps you would he good enough to indicate what alternative procedure they would suggest. It is, I imagine, common ground that action of the nature contemplated to he effective must admit of being taken immediately on the occurrence of an emergency or the outbreak of war, and the only question in issue is that of machinery. -Tha suggasliuii has mn.i1 n bn.Vfi tlvit If the Government of India were to issue a Regulation or the Governor- General wens- to ioouQ an Ordinance, tire think- it preferable that- it should follow the lines of the Defence of India (Criminal Law Amendment) Act, 1915, i.e confer power to make rules on the matters dealt with by the Order in Council of 1928, since this/Draft Paper.

Here the position is rather different*^ foe Protectorate is not part of British India.

It was eventually decided that powers for the Aden Settlement could be granted under the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council of 1902, through the Governor General in Council. It was also decided that the Aden Protectorate would best be served through the issuance of a Regulation under Section 71 of the Government of India Act.Subsequent correspondence for 1935 concerns the Defence of Aden Regulations (1935), and the potential for retrospective approval of emergency rules issued by the Chief Commissioner, in light of worsening relations with Italy.The principal correspondents in the file are as follows: the India Office Political Department (Sir John Laithwaite, Sir Horace Algernon Rumbold); the Legal Adviser to the Secretary of State for India (Sir Edward Chamier); the Air Ministry (Charles Evans); the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (Herbert Metcalfe); the Resident (later Chief Commissioner) at Aden; and the Under Secretary of State for the Colonial Office (Roland Vernon).The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
