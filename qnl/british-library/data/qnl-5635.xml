His Majesty’s Government had hoped and expected that when this inciaent was brought to their notice, the Persian Government would have taken spontaneously such disciplinary action as the case required, or at least have offered an expression of regret.

He said that M. Ala, who is at present in Belgium on holiday, had asked him to inform the Foreign Office orally of the contents of a telegram from the Persian Government about the Bushire flag incident. M. Ardalan read me a translation of the telegram. He said that he was not authorised to leave me a copy, hut on my pointing out that unless he did so I might very well misrepresent the terms of it, he agreed to do so on condition that it was regarded as a purely personal communication, and that the fact that he had left a copy should not he referred to» 2m M. Ardalan added that M. Ala had instructed him to say that he hoped this telegram would he regarded as satisfactorily closing the matter. I said that I felt hound at once to express the greatest disappointment at the communication. The contents of the telegram, in so far as it related to what had happened at Bushire, were entirely at variance with our information. There was no douht in our view that force had heen used; it was difficult to understand how the flag came to he hauled down otherwise. The Persian Government appeared simply to have accepted the denial of the officer concerned - a denial which was natural in the circumstances. Frankly, we had expected something better from the Persian Government. There was no douht that had the positions heen reversed and the Persian flag suffered insult a great deal would have heen made of the incident, there would ha' heen a press campaign, and the Persian Government would never have accepted an explanation of the sort now presented to us. 3.3« M. Ardalan said that he thought that the Persian G-overnment had not confined themselves to enquiring of Lieutenant Daryazadeh; he felt sure that they would have satisfied themselves from other quarters that the facts were as now stated. Had there been any suspicion of an insult to the British flag the Persian Government could not have done otherwise than apologise, hut it was incredible that a naval officer could have acted in the way which we had alleged, and incredible to think that he could have been acting with the approval or under the instructions of the Persian Government. I said that we should naturally never have suspected that he would do such a thing under the instructions or with the approval of the Persian Government; nevertheless, the fact remained that the flag had been hauled down as a result of Lieutenant Daryazadeh^s action. I was quite willing to believe what was reported at the time, that the officer was under the influence of drink and was to that extent not responsible for his action, but in view of our information I could not accept this statement that he had not exercised any pressure or force. I could only report to my higher authorities the communication which M. Ardalan had made, and I could not say at present what view they would take of it. I could only repeat my own dis appointment that, at a time when our relations seemed to be improving so much, the Persian Government had not dealt with the matter in a larger spirit. M. Ardalan who evidently did not relish his task said that after all it was only a trivial incident and he hoped that we would agree to regard it as closed. I said that I felt sure the Persian Government themselves would not have taken that view had the positions been reversed, and I felt that the present communication made it clear that they did not appreciate its seriousness or the impression which it had created here. FOREIGN OFFICE, 13th August,1935.A demand for a reprimand would only 'be justified if it had 'been proved that Daryazadeh was guilty of an insult to the flag of a friendly power. Investigations made a second time, at the request of the British Minister, have, however, confirmed the first report and Daryazadeh himself denies having exacted any pressure or force. There is no doubt that if it had been otherwise, and the officer had resorted to a measure contrary to regulations and without instructions, he would have been reprimanded without any reminder on the part of the British Legation. A statement to this effect has been made to the Legation. You should explain the position on the same lines. KAZKMIINDIA OFFICE, P. C ] Z» SS'iO/o D • 'WHITEHALL, S.V/. !♦ 17th August 1935.

Similar letter sent to 14 —6130 10950(2) V-COPY f ' f 7 y British Legation, Tehran. 3rd June, 1935. With reference to your telegram No. 121 of the 25th May I have the honour to inform you that I called on the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on June 1st and reverted to the subject of the Garmsir flag incident at Bushire. I said that the present state of affairs had continued long enough and that it was really desirable that a satisfactory conclusion should be reached. It was impossible for me to rest satisfied with the replies which I had so far received and, unless the Iranian Government were prepared to give me something more acceptable, there seemed nothing for me to do but to terminate the affair in my own way: I should do this by writing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressing disappointment at the failure of the Iranian Government to maJke suitable amends and saying that I had naturally thought that they would not wish to condone such behaviour or to give the impression that they approved an insult to the British merchant flag. I said that I had reported the matter to you and had your approval for this procedure. 2. Monsieur Soheily evidently did not relish this method of concluding the affair and a long conversation ensued in the course of which he assured me officially that the officer concerned had been severely taken to task for his (E 4032/83/34) No.242. Sir, The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc*, etc*, etc*. The Foreign Office.his action: close enquiries had been made and a large 5 dossier existed at the Ministry of War. He added that the Iranian Government were particularly anxious that their newly-formed Navy should act up to international standards and not incur obloquy by breaches of good manners. He could assure me that the officer had been very severely spoken to. The fact that, after my refusal to accept the first account which had been given to me by the Iranian authorities (as reported in my despatch No. 140 of the 2nd April), the officer had been questioned again by the military authorities and had denied having done anything at all was sufficient evidence of his anxiety to escape punishment. 3. I thought it useless to follow His Excellency further into this labyrinth of reasoning, but I feel quite convinced that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have done all in their power to obtain satisfaction, that the assurance given to me by Monsieur Soheily as reported at the beginning of the previous paragraph is genuine and that our Just resentment at this officer 1 s conduct has been fully brought home to all concerned. 4. I therefore turned to the other point and enquired whether His Excellency was prepared to give me a formal expression of regret. Monsieur Soheily answered quite frankly that as far as he personally was concerned such an expression could easily and readily be given but he added, speaking confidentially, that it could not be regarded as official unless it received the prior sanction of the Ministry of War. It was here that the difficulty lay. Some discussion ensued and finally His Excellency undertook to instruct the Persian Minister in London to speak to you. I trust that Monsieur Ala will be enabled to give you some acceptable expression of regret-5. Monsieur Schelly*s remark about the Ministry of War illustrates the difficulty in which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs find themselves in dealing with this and probably many other matters in which that Department are concerned. It is difficult for us to understand their reasons for refusing to express regret, but it is evidently impossible to force one from them, nor would such an extorted apology appear to be of much value. I suggest therefore that, in view of the assurances given to me by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs the matter should be regarded as closed, subject to the action taken by the Iranian Minister in London. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 103) and to His Majesty*s Consul-General at Bushire No. 47). I have, etc., (Signed) H.M.

Unless this was done, he did not think, speaking personally, that X should have any alternative but to refer the whole case to you with a request for official instructions, £• fhe following morning Motamedy, the head of the English section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, telephoned to Mr, Loxley and ashed him to call as he wished to speak to him about this case, Mr, Loxley went later that same morning and Motamedy then read out to him Lieutenant Darayazada's own version of the story which had new been received from the Ministry of ar, tfhe gist of it wee that hen the s*s, f Vasna fhe Bight honourable had/ ^ir John uimon, G*C*o*I., etc,, etc,, etc,, foreign Oxrice*hbd anchored at hushire and the launch had come alongside, hleutenant harayazada had enquired of a member of the crew whether this wee the ordinary launch that took off paaaengera and mail or whether, since it was flying the Ked Ensign, it was a prirate resale that had come to teke off some special traveller. On being told that it wee the ordinary launch, he had r r iren it as his prirate opinion that it was a pity that it did not in that case fly the Persian flag, fie hed finally been taken off not in this launch but in a pinnace that had brought out the quarantine officer and rarioue other officials, and the letter oould ell confirm the accuracy of his remarks, 4, Mr, Loxlty at once remarked that it was 4 .uite incredible that the crew of the launch should hare hauled down the x\ed Ensign unless Lieutenant jaray&amp;s&amp;d* had acted In a far more violent manner than he now admitted, and he added that we had evidence to show that he had actually struck a clerk employed by the British India Bteam navigation Company, ^otamedy was perfectly ready to admit that it was likely that Lieutenant Larayaeada had considerably toned down the truth, but he said that they now had this officer f s word for it that he had only wished to erpress his own private opinion. He had spoken entirely unofficially and it was clear that he had not desired to provoke an incident or to insult the British flag. He hoped that I would rest content with this explanation, 5. After further disuse!on, in which Mr, Loxley made it clear that it was entirely proper that the launch should fly the Hed Knsign, a statement which Motamedy did not dispute, Mr, Loxley succeeded in extracting from him a reiteration of the assurance that no insult had been intended/_ intended end an expreaaion oi regret that this officer^ conduct had in fact ltd to an incidents 6 # it ia unfortunately true f how«Ter # that little or nothing ia ever gained by diwcusaing zaattera with *iotamedy. Whenever he ha a a statement to aalte, he reada out mechanically a translation of some document that has been received from acme other Government Department, and any other remarks that he makes in the course of discussion must be regarded ae purely personal observations* It is also virtually certain that he does not report to his superiors, or if so only very vaguely, observations that one addresses to him oneself. In ti» present case there *ae, therefore,littie doubt that the ; “,ulament tost no insult had been intended and the expression of regret came from himself alone; that the Ministry of fcar had not in faot done more then forward Lieutenant Daraymzada's own story, and that «iOtamedy would not report to anyone else that he had in faot delivered some sort of apology* Ltill less evidence was there that any reprimand had been addressed to Lieutenant Larayaaada or th* t even any admonition would reach him as to hie future conduct. 7# Mr. Loxley was accordingly in half a mind to refuse this explanation altogether but finally decided that, as I should be back in two days time, it would be best to report to me and to let matters stand as they were for the moment. 8 . Having decided that I could not let the (question drop until I had been iurnished with at any rate some satisfactory assurance of a more official nature, I took the opportunity of a recent call on i^azemi to revert to it but linking that he was, or pretended to be, ignorant of the details, decided not to purme it until he should have had time/time to familiarise himself with the dossier. He appears, however, to have misunderstood what I said, for 140 tamed? telephoned to Mr. Loxley on £7th March and said that Xa?.emi had told him that X had enquired when I might expect a reply in this matter. He wished to remind kr. Loxley of the fact that he had given him an explanation some three weeks before tnd to say that the ministry had no other information about the case in their possession. He would be glad if this could be brought to my notice. Mr. hoxley replied that he had reported the matter to m on my return, that X had studied lieutenant ^ar&amp;yaz&amp;de's version of the incident and that I had mentioned it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs because I wanted to dit^cuss the case with him further. fhe letter must evidently have misunderstood what 1 had said, perhaps because 1 had not gone into the question fully as I had found him unfamiliar with the details. 9. In the light of Motaraedy’s remarks I have thought it best not to await my next interview with Hi a 33 oellency before taking up the matter again, but to write to him at once. X have accordingly sent him a letter, of which I 3mve the honour to enclose a copy and which is designed to give him an opportunity of settling the matter on the easiest possible terms. Xn many ways the ministry of Foreign Affairs have already done their best - for instance, JOheily twice refused to accept and to pass on to me tne replies which he received from the Ministry of var - and X suspect that the very lame apology vouchsafed by Motamedy is as much as the? darp gif® us.

This has formed the subject of representations to the Iranian ministry of foreign Affairs on frequent occasions since &amp;£nd December ( ^©y let, 1313) when I first brought it to four excellency's notice. £• I need not repeat the details. It is sufficient to remind Your Excellency that the reports which I ha Ye received make it clear that this officer's conduct amounted to an insult to the merchant flag of a friendly Power and that the circumstances were such that It was impossible for me to overlook the matter. I therefore asked that the Iranian Government would be good enough to give me an assurance that they had marked their disapproval of this officer's conduct by disciplinary action against him. 3. Up to the pretent time I have received no such assurance nor indeed any written reply to tuy representations. 4. On 6 th inarch (Esfand Ibth) during my absence from Tehran, the head of the English section at the Ministry for f oreign Affairs read to Mr. Loxley Lieutenant Larayesada's account of what had occurred and stated that he had not intended to provoke an incident. Excellency's attention to the fact that I am still uninformed as/as to whether or not disciplinary action h&amp;e been taken against the officer concerned. I have no wish to magnify a matter which, however regrettable, was due to action for which the officer named above w&amp;e personally and solely responsible, hut incident a such as these cannot fail to have a detrimental effect upon tnoae good relations between our two oountrie s which Tour i&amp;oellency and X are so anxious to promote and if they are allowed to drag on, as in the present case, they ean only be the more harmful. 6 .

J 2nd February, 1935 Sir Y* With reference to your despatch No. 5 (E 7629/7277/34) of 3rd January, and to previous correspondence regarding the Bushire flag incident, I have the honour to inform you that since 22nd December, when (as reported in my telegram No. 208 of 23rd December) I first brought the matter to the notice of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have continually pressed for a reply indicating that disciplinary action has been taken against Lieutenant Darayazda. On 14th January I gave the prime Minister a copy of the Aide-memoire which I had handed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 22nd December and informed His Highness that in the absence of an early satisfactory answer I should have no option but to refer the matter to you for further instructions. 2. On 22nd January I mentioned the matter to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and showed him an aide- memoire couched in rather more emphatic terms which I had previously drawn up and which I said I should feel compelled to hand to him if no satisfaction were given within a short time. 3. On 1st February I again raised the matter with Monsieur Soheily, pointing out that it seemed to me incredible that an answer had been so long delayed. In the converse case not only would a spontaneous expression of regret have been/ The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc. , etc. , etc. , The Foreign Office.(ST) teen made immediately the occurrence were brought to the notice of the Foreign Ofi ice, 'but the whole matter would have been dealt with within two or three days. This was just one of the tiresome questions which I had hoped to see disposed of rapidly. I was leaving for the Gulf on 7th February and must press for a satisfactory reply by that date. 4. Monsieur Soheily informed me that he had had two separate reports from the Ministry of War but had refused to accept them on the ground that they did not form a suitable basis for a reply to me. Apparently these reports attempted to justify Lieutenant Darayazda's conduct on the ground that the 'Garmsir' was in Persian territorial waters and was consequently out of order in flying the red ensign. Monsieur Soheily evidently did not support this argument. I said that it seemed to me to be untenable. I could not accept the territorial waters argument and in any case it did not justify the officer’s conduct. I handed ..onsieur Soheily the aide-memoire of 22nd January (of which a copy is enclosed) which I had shown him on that date. He read it and, of his own choice, kept it. He assured me that the matter would be cleared un before I left on 7th February. 6* I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No.21), and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 9).

On December 22nd (Dey 1st, 1313) His Britannic Majesty’s Minister handed to His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs a statement regarding the conduct of Lieutenant Abdul Abbas Darayazda, Acting Commander of the Persian gunboat 'Shahrokh”. On November 26th (Azar 5th 1313), when the motor launch owned by the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation went out from Bushire to meet the s.s.'Yasna”, this officer, who was a passenger in the latter vessel, ordered the Captain of the launch to lower the Red Ensign. In the face of his attitude, which was threatening and abusive, the crew found themselves forced to comply. The conduct of this officer, who was in uniform at the time, amounted to an insult to the merchant flag of a friendly Power and His Majesty’s Minister requested the Persian Government to mark their disapproval of his conduct by disciplinary action. Failing receipt of a satisfactory assurance that such action had been taken, His Majesty’s Minister on January 14th (Dey 24th, 1313) handed to His Highness the Prime Minister a copy of his original statement and repeated his request. His Majesty’s Minister regrets that a month has now passed since he brought this matter to the notice of the Persian Government in the first instance. Mr. KnatchLull- Hugessen is reluctant to believe that this delay implies that the Persian Government condone the action of Lieutenant Darayazda and he finds himself, therefore, forced to press for an early reply indicating what action the Persian Government have taken in the matter.

I agree that incident cannot be allowed to pass without protest but various considerations point to need for caution. 2. In the first place Lieutenant Darayazda v/as a pas senger in a British ship surrounded by a British crew and, as it happened (though point is not very material), outside three mile limit, fact that he v/as in uniform makes com pliance of nakhuda more comprehensible but it is difficult not to feel that much of blame rests with those who obeyed f order or allowed it to be carried out in circumstances which did not constitute forc e majeure. 3. Secondly Lieutenant Darayazda cannot have been on duty and v/as apparently drunk. His action, v/hile inexecusable and all the more reprehensible for the fact that he was in uniform, must clearly have been unauthorised. 4. It is thus a matter of some difficulty to establish direct Persian responsibility and it would, I feel, be a mis take to take line at the outset that incident must be regard ed as intentional Persian insult to the flag, for which Per sian Government are responsible, as they would have been if the officer had been exercising his official duties or acting on instructions. 5. Your action should therefore at present be limited to bringing the facts to the attention of the Persian Government/** Government in the ma.mier proposed in the penultimate paragraph of your telegram mo. 179 (of Jecemher 5th) and pressing for disciplinary action against Lieutenant Darayazda on the groum that his conduct was clearly most improper on the part of an officer of the Persian Navy, whether actually on duty or not. v 6. Should the Persian Government refuse to take any measures against the officer concerned the position as re gards their responsibility will, of course, be altered and i matter will require further consideration.

The nakhuda was a Persian subject. The incident was public, but the ship has since put to sea with flag flying and has not been interfered with. It is not yet clear whether the incident took place (a) within the three-mile territorial water limit which we recognise; or (b) within the six-mile territorial limit claimed by Persia. a. I think the line taic.en by llr. Rendel in his letter of 10th December sftgssresai&amp;a is the right one. It would be a mistake to treat the incident as an intentional insult to the Flag, though we are clearly entitled to make a protest to the Persian Government ana to press for disciplinary action against the naval officer concerned, we nay agree with the Foreign Office also that at this stage it is unnecessary unuuly to magnify the incident, and on the whole I suggest that we might concur in the instructions to Mr. Hugessen suggested in paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office letter, viz. the Minister to speak to the M.F.A. as for himself, pointing out that in the few days I have been here this is the third serious complaint with which I have had to deal. I would add that it is hopeless for us to try to improve our relations if this sort of thing is to continue and appeal to him to deal with this case promtly before I am compelled to ask you for instructions'; the Minister further to press for an enquiry and disciplinary action against the naval officer.3.

Laithwaite, Esq. K£'\) But we feel that it is a case where COPY SENT BY AIR COPY SENT BY AIR I^U- . of _28DECJ954 (Vi* a t~a - 2 ru..shall have to proceed with a good deal of caution, since, seeing that the naval officer was not on duty, and appears moreover to have been rather drunk at the time, it is clear that his action must have been unauthorised; and it may thus be rather difficult to establish any direct Persian responsibility. We feel therefore that it would be a mistake to take the line, at the outset at any rate, that this incident must be regarded as an intentional Persian insult to the flag for which the Persian Government are responsible - as it would have been had the officer been exercising his official duties or carrying out instructions - and we think that the most we can reasonably do is to instruct Hugessen to bring the facts to the attention of the Persian Government - perhaps using the language suggested in the penultimate paragraph of his telegram No.179 - and press for disciplinary action against Lieutenant Darayazda on the ground that his action was clearly most improper on the part of an officer of the Persian navy whether/whether actually on duty or not* If the Persian Government then refuse to take any measures against Lieutenant Darayazda, the position will he different, and it may he easier to establish a good grievance against the Persian Government itself. ) 3. Meanwhile we feel that the less made of this incident the better, particularly as it is difficult to avoid feeling that much of the blame must rest on those who obeyed the order, or allowed it to be carried out. 4. I am inclined, therefore, subject to your concurrence, to suggest that we should authorise Hugessen to speak to the Persian Government on the lines he suggests in the penultimate paragraph of his telegram No.179, at the same time pressing for an enquiry and disciplinary action against Lieutenant Darayazda. If this leads to no result, we shall have to consider the matter further, but meanwhile we might give Hugessen the substance of the above considerations for his own information./information. 5.

Begins:- Addressed to Tehran No. 157, copy sent by sea mail to Secretary of State, Government of India and Senior Naval Officer. Manager of : esopotamian-Persian Corporation, Bushire, as agent for British India Steam navigation Company reports that on November 26th when the British India motor tender Garrnsir was alongside the s.s, 'Vasna' a Persian naval officer, Lieutenant Abdul Abbas Darayazda, Acting Commander of gunboat Chahrokh, who was a passenger on the 'Vasna', ordered the Nakhuda of the launch (the manager himself was not on the launda) to lower the ^od Design which was being flown at the stern a The attitude of Lieutenant Darayazda, who it is believed was under the influence of drink, was so threatening and abusive (he actually struck a British Indian clerk) that this order was obeyed and the launch returned from the 'Vasna' with the flag lowered. 2. The Nakhuda of my launch who had gone to the 'Vasna' in the Customs launch confirms the above report, 3 0 The clerk, Nakhuda and crew of the Garmsir are Persian subjects with the exception of the engineer who is2. an Iraqi, 4. The Garmsir is a British craft registered in Calcutta and has therefore every right to fly the Red Ensign at the stern. 5. The insult in forcing the flag to be lowered was a public one and must, for instance, have been observed by all on board the 'Yasna' and we cannot, in my opinion, let it pass, more especially in view of the Basidu flag in cident. I venture to suggest that the least we can demand from the Persian Government is an apology and punishment of the officer. 6. The Garmsir has since put to sea with flag flying and has not been again interfered with. Unless we take action, however, there is no guarantee that the insult will not be repeated. 7. I suggest that pending your decision as to action to be taken I write to the Governor bringing the facts in paragraphs 1 and 2 to his notice and informing him that I have reported the incident to you.

I take it th \t Garmsir had. been required, under Merchant Shipping Act of 1394 to fly the Red Ensign in the circum stances described. As Lieutenant Darayazda was a passenger in British India liner he woe presumably not an duty* If so, either he was wearing Persian naval uniform when not entitled to do so or he was in plain clothes, in which case he had no right to give orders; in either case I presume we are entitled to object. I am asking Political Resident to renort on this. Matter is clearly one which must be taken up strongly with Persian Government, i7e could use arguments in two preceding paragraphs (if you agree) and any others which you can supply. There may also be argument regarding territorial waters (see my telegram No. 140 to Bushire). In addition I suggest we should ask for full enquiry and disciplinary action against Lieutenant Darayazda. I doubt utility of asking Minister for Foreign Affairs to apologize as chances of getting him to do so are very remote but I would suggest asking either that Governor of Southern Ports.,..2. Ports should tender apology to His Majesty’s Consul- General or that Persian na.val authorities or officer con cerned should do so. I should he glad of your views on above points and also on suggestion in following paragraph* I would propose in the first instance to speak to Minister for foreign Affairs as from myself, pointing out that in the few days I have been here this is the third serious complaint with which I have had to deal* I would add that it is hopeless for us to try to improve our re lations if this sort of thing is to continue and appeal to him to deed with this case promptly before I am compelled to ask you for instructions. If this fails it will be necessary to consider what further action can be taken* Minister for Foreign Affairs is away for some days (see my telegram No. 175) so we have time.
