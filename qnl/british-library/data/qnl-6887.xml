DISPOSAL UP COIIQUttRKD 'MiHITORIES. X. eaopotamia. 1, The conquered territory in which India has the largest and most direct interest is Mesopotamia. As is well known, India has been mainly instrumental in the conquest of this region. The majority ef the troops employed were Indian; the expedition has throughout been based upon India; and the civil administration of the &gt; occupied districts has from the first been carried on under the guidance and inspiration of the Indian OoYernment. 2, Indian interest in Mesopotamia is not a thing of yesterday. Very close ties, mainly religious and commercial, have existed between the two countries for many years past. The religious connection, based upon the famous Shiah Shrines at Kerbala, Nejef, etc; found concrete expression in the H Oudh Bequest* 1 - a fund administered by the Oovemment of India, on behalf of the poor at the Holy Places. The comnercial relations of India with all parts of the Persian Gulf are loo well known to require description. It may be recalled that, before the war, the British Consul-General at Baghdad was normally an officer of trie Indian loiitiwal Department, reporting direct to the Government of India as well as to the Ambassador at Constantinople, and bearing in addition to his Consular designation, the Indian title of 'Resident' in Turkish Arabia.2. Above all, India has a strategic intereet in Mesopotamia. The story of German penetration in the direction of the Persian Gulf - the celebrated 'Berlin- Baghdad* project - is well known. It was recognised even beiort the war as a direct menace to our position in Indiaj^. By good fortune the enemy designs were still incomplete when the war broke out. We were able, within a rery few weeks of Turkey's intervention, to occupy Basra; and have since pushed our front northwards far beyond Baghdad. It is essential that our rivals should in no circumstances and under no condition what soever be permitted to resume their operations after the war. A barrier must be set up in Mesopotamia, whatever its precise form, that will effectually close the land line to the head of the Gulf against any potential enemy of the British Empire. 4. If this object is to be achieved, it may be regarded as axiamatic (1) that no part of Mesopotamia must be restored to the Turks; and (2) that the conquered territories must remain under effective British control. The simplest plan would be to annex the whole area, or at any rate the portions of it lying nearest the Gulf, to the British Crown, and to administer the country as a British possession. But if this is impracticable - as is understood to be the accepted view - and the only alternative is to set up an Arab State under British protection, we must at least ensure that our A. protection is real and exclusive, and that it leaves no opening for the machinations of foreign Powers. ^e need be under no illusions as to the ability of an Arab administrationadministration, if left to itself, to resist foreign intrigue or to bar the way to foreign encroachment. It is not enough to expel the Turk. We cannot afford to leave the house swept and garnished for seven other devils worse than the first to take up their abode. We must control, and effectively control, the external relations ol the Arab State. If there is to be a fair diplomatic field and no favour, German diplomacy will inevitably beat us with the Arabs, just as it beat us ^ with the Turks. We may live to see the Baghdad railway contract renewed by an Arab Grovemraent. We may start the next war with the mouth of the 3hat-el- Arab fortified by Oerman engineers as strongly as the mouth of the Thames, and with German submarine bases all along the Persian Gulf. de simply cannot afford to take the risk . 5. There is a further point which, though not of specially Indian application, may perhaps be mentioned here. we have an unparalleled opportunity of rescuing a country of enormous economic potentialities from the stagnation and neglect of centuries. To say that it is an opportunity of 1,000 years is no rhetorical exaggeration, but well within the limits of sober historical fact. We have already started the work of regeneration, and aannot throw up the task without incurring a heavy charge at the bar of civilisation. It is certain that the Arab,ff left to himself, will do nothing. Again, there can be no room for illusion on that score. If we stand aside, the result must inevitably be either (1) that the country will relapse into-Ill III into its old condition or (2) that the work of e p eration will fall to less scrupulous agents thari ourselves. The former alternative is scarcely thinkable. If for no other reason, the world, faced as it will be with something approaching t'j universal faaine conditions for some years to come, will not allow a huge new grain producing area to be pterilised. oomebody has got to do the work; and we, who have set our hand to the plough t cannot afford to look back. As the head of the American Relief Mission to Persia recently remarked to the Civil Commissioner at Baghdad:- ' v ou British must stay here to c^rry on this 'great work in the interests of the world'. IL aifl&amp;AN EAST AVRTCf. 1. India may be said to be interested in Grerman East Africa (1) because, in the hands pf a Power hostile, or potentially hostile, to Great Britain, it might atfford a base for enemy naval activity in the Indian Ocean; and (2) because of the advantages offered by the Colony for Indian immigration. The claims of India to colonisation rights in the new territory have been strongly urged by the Government of India. The decision to remove 1 esopotamia - in the conquest of which India has so largely participated - from the sphere of Indian interest makes it the more desirable to find a field for Indian expansion elsewhere; while it will go far to silence hostile criticism in India if we are in a position to show that the country has obtained some tangible advantage in return for its war services.
