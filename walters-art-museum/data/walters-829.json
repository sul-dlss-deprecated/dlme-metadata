Iznik, located in northwestern Turkey, was a major center for quality ceramics that reached a highpoint of production during the 16th century, when these panels were made. They would not originally have been placed next to one another, as they are not consecutive verses.\r\n\r\nThe first four panels are from chapter two, verse 257, which refers to Allah being a guardian of believers bringing them out of the darkness and into the light. The fifth and sixth panels are from chapter three, verse 26. This latter verse speaks of Allah being the beholder of the Kingdom, which is bestowed upon the devout.
