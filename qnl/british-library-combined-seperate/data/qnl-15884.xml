Replied to 29 July 1858. A memorandum sent (23 April 1858) by Henry Lacon Anderson from Bombay Castle requiring a report in connection with correspondence with Sultan bin Suggar bin Khalid of Ras al-Khaimah.Letter explains that the claim that the Sheekeyheen tribe [Sharqiyin] attacked the town of Dibba is 'wholly without foundation'. Jones contends that the motive for this claim is to enlist sympathy from the Government of India to allow Sultan bin Suggar to be allowed to march against the Sheekeyheen and subject them to his rule and divert them from their allegiance to H.H. the Imam of Muscat. The letter explains that in January 1859 the Resident learnt that Sultan bin Suggar was contemplating a naval expedition against Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi] and interdicted a naval movement whilst also taking measures against the Sheekeyeen to restore property to the Joasmee (Qasimi).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023650865.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
