CONFIDENTIAL. .... [September 23.] Section 1. i ■- ■ ' [37307] No. 1. Memorandum with reference to Sheikh Said, on the Coast of Arabia. THE accompanying cutting from the “ Republique ” of the 30th instant, which has just been received from Mr. Austin Lee, shows the reception accorded to M. Hugues Le Roux by the Turkish military authorities at Sheikh Said. The claims or designs of France with reference to this locality have given rise to much correspondence in the past, and more than one memorandum has been written on the subject. The place was originally purchased from an Arab sheikh by two Frenchmen named Maas (or Mass) and Poilex in January 1869, but the Porte denied the validity of the sale, and the sheikh declared that it was void by reason of the purchase money not having been paid. His Majesty’s Government have always maintained that Sheikh Said belongs to Turkey, and in 1893, when it was reported that the French authorities at Obokh were negotiating for its transfer to France, urged that a strong Turkish force should at once be sent there. On the 2nd May, 1895, M. H. Maas, who had written to this Office on the subject, was informed that the opinion already expressed to him that Sheikh Said was Turkish territory was in no way altered. The question of the occupation of Sheikh Said by France was again mooted in Paris in 1897, and enquiries were made at His Majesty’s Embassy as to whether it was occupied by British troops. The India Office concurred in the proposed reply that there was no truth in the rumoured British occupation, and that Plis Majesty’s Government considered it to be Turkish territory. In April 1897 a resolution for the “ reoccupation ” of Sheikh Said by France was introduced into the French Chamber of Deputies, when M. Brisson’s proposal that it should be printed and circulated, and, if unopposed, transmitted to the Colonial Commission, was agreed to by the house. The Turkish Ambassador at Paris was instructed to call M. Hanotaux’s attention to the fact that Sheikh Said was part of the Ottoman dominions. The last reference to this place in the correspondence now in the custody of the librarian appears to be the announcement made by Sir E. Monson in June 1899 that an offer had been made to the United States Ambassador at Paris on behalf of Messrs. Bazin and Rabaud, who claimed Sheikh Said, to sell it to the United States for 400,000 dollars.

[Continuation of Memorandum of January 31, 1901.] IN February 1903 the French Ambassador asked Lord Lansdowne L)r information as to our difficulties with the tribes in the neighbourhood of Aden, adding that France had no interest in the matter except to this extent—that there were French claims upon a spot called Sheikh Said opposite the Island of Perim. Lord Lansdowne gave him a rough sketch of the circumstances which had created somewhat strained relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Turkish authorities m the Yemen, and told him that the territory of the tubes m which we had an interest did not extend so far to the west as Sheikh Said, but wished him, however, to understand that he expressed no opinion as to the validity of the Irench claims to Sheikh Sa'id. On the 11th January, 1905, the French Ambassador told Lord Lansdowne that he had observed that we were engaged in a discussion with the Turkish Government as to the boundary of the Aden cantons, and that he wished to take this opportunity of reminding him that France had certain claims at Sheikh Said. The French Govern ment had no desire to raise the question, but it was desirable that we should be aware that it existed. Lord Lansdowne replied that, without making any admissions as to the rights of France at Sheikh Said, he was able to say at once that the frontier line as we proposed to draw it would strike the coast at a point considerably farther south than that place. It was therefore not necessary that the question of Sheikh Said should be discussed between them. It was then suggested that the matter should be referred to the Defence Committee, as Sheikh Said if fortified would render Perim untenable and close the narrow strait, though it would not dominate the wide strait, but the suggestion does not appear to have been acted on. Sheikh Said is in the Subaihi territory, and, in connection with the boundary agreement of 1905, the Turkish Government has undertaken never to alienate to a third Power the Subaihi territory lying between Husn Murad and Kudam, in which Sheikh Said is situate. Two masonry pillars in cement were built by the British Commission, and the Turkish had a cairn of rough stone erected in the vicinity of Sheikh Said. Foreign Office, September 23, 1911. G. E. P.

The point LXX is situated about 600 yards, i.e., nearly 550 ^ metres to the west and south of the hill called J. Mijbiya and is marked by a Cairo of rough stones, some two metres in height erected by the Turks. From LXX the line runs straight to point LXXI on the most northerly of the two rocky hillocks lying to the north and west of J. Sue’diya. Point XXI is marked by a masonry pillar in cement, about 2 ^ feet square at the base and five feet in height. The two hillocks are known to the Arabs and Jebel Laheji. | From point LXXI the boundary runs again in straight line to the highest point of headland called Husn Murad. At LXXII a pillar of masonry in cement 2^ feet at the base and 6 feet high has also been erected. Husn Murad is sometimes called Shekh Murad, or simply Al Husn {i.e., the fort) fr&lt;&gt;m an old native-built fort, the remains of which still exist at the spot. From this pillar the line follows the crest of Husn Murad to the water's edge at a point marked LXXI on the boundary map.

Sir:- I spoke to the Minister for Foreign Affairs a short time ago respecting the execution of some formality, such for instance as the exchange of notes recording officially the result of the Aden Frontier Delimitation. His Excellency concurred as to the desirability of something of the kind, but said that it would necessitate a fresh Irade and that in pre sent circumstances it would he very difficult to get this from the Sultan, and a formal request might possibly give rise to new complications. The maps signed hy the Commissioners of both countries had been received, by the Minister of War and the delimitation of the frontier as shown in them had not been question- ■ ed, so that the matter could in a certain sense be considered as settled. He was inclined, therefore, to think that it would not be advisable to broach the subject and the Under Secretary of State also Sir Edward Grey, Bart., &amp;c. , &amp;c., &amp;c. stronglystrongly recommended that the matter sq onId he allowed to remain as it stood, as the maps were in themselves sufficient proof of the work accomplished and the * delimitation agreed on in common. I am rather disposed to concur in Tewfik Pasha’s views, the more so that every section of the ooundary agreed to hy the Ottoman Commissioners has been sane- tloned by separate Trades and Vizirial orders obtained during the course of the negotiations; at the same time I feel that from an official point of view it would be more satisfactory, were the usual formalities completed. If, however, I press for an Trade it is quite possible that some of the difficulties and obstructions foreseen by the Minister for Foreign Affairs may arise and that the Imperial Government, in order to avoid making an application to the Palace for an Trade may advance the argument that the North East portion of tne boundary between Wadi Sana and the desert has not yet been delimited in detail, and that until that is done the final formalities by exchange of note or otherwise cannot be carried out. withoutWithout incurring the risk of raising an em barrassing question I think it may he possible for Mr. Fitzmauriee to compare the maps in the Embassy with those in the possession of the Ottoman Minis ter of War, and if you consider, as I am inclined to think, that this constitutes a sufficient record of the frontier delimitation, I am disposed not to move further. I do not, however, like to leave matters in their present condition without taking your instructions. I have &amp;c., .

I understand one of the main obstacles in the past has been the local jealousies amongst the Beda Chief and minor Sheikhs, which I trust, however, to be able to overcome and I am not without hope that within a reasonable time that the treaty in question will be concluded, unless perhaps the present troubles in Yemen should have a disturbing effect on the British side of the border. A fuller report on the subject will follow by next mail. 5 [C275FDJ3. The settlement of the south-west border (Subaihi) appears to me to be satisfactory, whilst it has also been a great advantage to have the north-east line put in principle on a more definite basis.

In accordance with the Government of India’s instructionsj conveyed to me in the British Ambassador’s telegram No. 16 of April 18th, I have, as reported in my telegram § of April 20th, settled with the Turkish Commissioner the out standing portion of some sixty miles of the south-west frontier of the Subaihi, as also the questions expressly included in the recent negotiations with the Turks respecting the north-east boundary line to the desert. I forward herewith the maps (^' to the mile, general map and 1/10,000 large scale map of the Sheikh Said Peninsula) with the boundary line marked thereon, as also a detailed description of this section of the frontier, all duly signed by Colonel Mustapha Remzi, the Ottoman Commissioner.

In it will be found mentioned the arrangement com municated by the Sublime Porte in a note verbale, dated March 14th, 1905, to His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople concerning the undertaking given by the Ottoman Government not to alienate to a third Power the Subaihi territory lying between the line actually delimited from J. Numan to Husn Murad and the line of the old Subaihi border from J. ’Akama through J. ’Akkar to Kudam on the shore of the Bed Sea. | Map iu Hid. 3. The wording of the Porte’s note is vague in not giving the north-western limits {i.e.y ’Akama and Kudam) of the territory to which the non-alienation agreement refers, but, I understand, that the British Ambassador has subse quently obtained from the Sublime Porte a statement in writing indicating T PrcNo. 263 in Secret E„ June 1903, No.' mOTe P^cisely the territory tO which the 178-323. arrangement refers. {Vide Secretary oi State for India’s telegram^ - of April 4th to the Government of India, Poreign Department). 67 4. The tenor of the official telegram on the subject from the „ Minister of War to the Turkish • Pro. No. 236 m Secret E„ Jane 150c, Noe. follows :— 178-323. Ottoman Commis- 1905, was as “ The British Government has wished to impose a condition that the Imperial Government shall never cede to a third Power the territory situated between the Akama-Kudam line and the second line terminating at Husn Murad which you are hereby instructed to delimit. Such a condition could not be deemed worthy of discussion even, but the Ottoman Ambassador in London has made a communication concerning the territory adjoining the Husn Murad line, which the British Foreign Minister has accepted as a sufficient pledge on the subject.*’ When urged to insert in the proces-verbal the words “ Akama and Kudam ” as the northern limits of the territory in question, the Turkish Com missioner demurred, saying that, in view of the above instructions, he could only agree to the mention of “ the territory adjoining the Murad line” and that the reference might even be to the territory to the south of that line. He subse quently agreed to the wording “ adjoining and to the north of the Numan Murad line.” 5. With regard to the section of the Subaihi border from J. Numan to Husn Murad as finally drawn on the accompanying maps, it may be remarked that the Boundary Commission, on entering the Subaihi country, was given to understand that the western Subaihi frontier passed by J. Am Missas and thence skirted the southern slopes of the hills, reaching the sea in the vicinity of Turba, while it was found that the Turks locally laid claim to all the territory east of Sheikh Said up to the line of J. Am Missas, J. Kharaz and Has Arab. 6. Subsequently investigations showed that the western borders of the Juledi, Buremi and Atifi sections of the Subaihi extended respectively to the points ’Akama, ’Akkar and Kudam and, although these extreme limits have not been insisted on, the boundary actually delimited from J. Numan to Husn Murad still vindicates the Subaihi claims as against Turkish pretensions, to the extent of some hundreds of square miles. The Turks had, in the past, un obtrusively exercised jurisdiction up the line of J. Am Missas and J. Kharaz, the Subaitii tribal subsections of Mudariba, Aghbari, Kaluli, Mahwali and Jarthati having actually paid taxes to the Ottoman officials at Mokha. 7 . The Turkish Commissioners at first insisted strongly on their claim to the Aghbari, mainly on account of the religious importance attached by their authorities to the well-known shrine of Turba Abu-Al-Esrar situated within Aghbari limits, and it was only in the coarse of the Ottoman Commissioner’s recent prolonged stay at Sheikh Said that the claim was relinquished. The result was to yield a natural boundary which from J. Numan almost entirely follows the watershed between the Bed Sea and the Gulf of Aden, is easily distinguishable and has the further merit of being the recognized border be tween the tribal subsections inhabiting the country through which it passes. 8. Despite the general barren character of the country this section of the frontier has also the advantage that it can be easily visited by largo or small parties, as sufficient water for a camp of from 300 to 400 men is to be found at short stages or marches along its entire extent at Mijza there is abundant flowing water and similarly at Mudariba some 8 miles to the west of Mijza. The wells at Turba Abu-al-Esrar, some 8 miles north-west of Mudariba, yield a fair amount of good water, and water is also to be had in the upper reaches of the Wadis Batan and Farrukhia, while there is a plentiful spring at Ghail Hurim (the point marked 1575 on the ^ inch map) in Wadi Hurim. Water is also obtainable lower down the same wadi at the point 1120 due south of J. Jariba, as also at Am Nabia and Sukaiya, which have each a fair supply of good drinking water. 9.

The Map in Secret e., March 1901 , Nos. 83-199. specific admission that Rups’aten, Na’wa and Dabiani belong to Yafa now definitely carries the line some twenty miles further in the north-east direction. 12.

I may point out that the basis of demarcation accepted by both Govern ments was the status of 1901, and that at that time all four places were considered as iurkish, while the A.deu Risidency records of 1894 mentioned Rube’aten, Na*wa and Juban as being within Turkish limits. Thus in obtain ing the recognition by the Tarks that Rube^ten, Na’wa and Dabiani are Yafa’, we are obtaining more than the status of 1901 warranted. Accord- I! Enclosure, to Pro. No. US in Secret E., March ing to the document inclosed in the Com- 1904 , Nos. 83-i99. mission’s No. 340|| of October 26th, 1903, Rube’aten is so indisputably Yafa’ that it could not have been left to the Turks without a loss of prestige vis-a-vis our tribesmen, but the Yafa* connection with the other places in question is much weaker. 13. The words in the proces-verbal “as also all other Yafa districts lying to the south and east of the aforesaid north-east line ” are intented to cover Reyu, an appanage of the Yafa’ Map Sultan Haidara Muhammad of Mahjaba, and also Ahl Said A1 Mashrik, a small nomad tribal section related to Dabiani, should the the Turks, at the moment of demarcation, desire to dispute their Yafa’ connection. 14. The statement of the Ottoman Commissioner quoted in the proces- , verbal that the basis of the north-east Map in Secret E., March 1904, No*. 83-199. , .. . • ^ a t^° demarcation is in general the north 45 E. line, or true north-east line from Lakamat Ash Shub up to the desert entitles us to consider at the least, all tribes to the south and east of the true north-east line as within the British sphere.15. The specific admission that the Aulaki with all its subdivisions and dependencies are one of the “ nine cantons ” completes the list of the nine tribes which the Porte since 1873 was supposed to have recognised as British. The late Resident’s telegram* of December 20th, 1903, states that the Aulaki Sultan claims If this is so in fact, the district is a depen dency of the Aulaki. I believe, moreover, a treatyf was concluded early in 1904 with Sharif Ahmad Mohsin of Behan al-Kasab. * Pro. No. 198 in Secret E., March 1904, Nos. 83- 199. + Enclo to Pro. No. 199 in Secret E., May 1904, Nos. 158-2J3. suzerainty over Behan-al-Kasab. 16. The recent demarcation was proposed by the Sultan of Turkey on the „ . c ,„ „ w .. 1on basis of the “nine cantons ” i.e., the nine British tribes notified to the Porte in 1873. As Beda was not one of these, it became imperative vis a-vis the Turkish Gov ernment, as repeatedly pointed out by the Commission, to enter into treaty en gagements with Beda as early as possible, and notify the same to the Porte so as to bring it within the scope of His Majesty’s Government’s declaration in j Pro. No. 120 in Secret e., June 1904 , Nos 22 - 1873 that it reserved the right to make 132 * fresh treaties with the tribes. The hitch § Fro. No 432 m Secret e , October 1904 , in concluding a treaty with Beda (vide Nos. c 61-445. Resident’s telegram^ to Poreign, Simla, of May 12th, 1901) and its consequent omission from the notification to the Porte of August llth§ 1904, made it, with its dependencies, the one serious gap in the north-east line. Secret E., March 1904, Nos. 83-199. 17. Were a Joint Anglo-Turkish Mission to proceed as far as the north-east limits of Dabiani, the Turkish Commis sioners would refuse to rec &gt;gnize Beda as within our sphere and a prolonged delay would occur before precise orders on the subject could be obtained and reach them from Constantinople. It is true that the words in ths praces-verbal, “ in general the N. 45 E. line up to the desert ” imply that Beda, etc., are on the British side of the line, but a Turk ish Commission on the spot would nevertheless, probably maintain that Beda and its dependencies, are part of the Turkish administrative subdistrict of Rada. 18. As a protracted stay in the Dabiani country, a barren tract wh ose com- 0 munications are execrable and transport Secret E., March 1904, Nos. 83-199. i-nr* . i -i -i r , dimculties very great, would be most costly, if not, indeed, dangerous, it would seem essential that, before any Joint Commission ever undertakes the north-east demarcation, the Turkish Gov ernment should be induced to send categorical instructions to the Yaman autho rities to recognize Beda, with it its dependencies as belonging to the district of the “ nine cantons.” 19. Eor that purpose, after a treaty is concluded with Beda, the Porte could he reminded that His Majesty’s Government, in notifying the original nine tribes to the Ottoman Government in 1873, had specially reserved the right to c xi, tut vto™ at on i qq enter into fresh engagements of the sort, Secret E., March 1904, Nos. 80-199. -i • p -i j i ° t x t t and informed that such arrangements had been concluded with Beda and, perhaps also Behan-al-Kasab, which lie mainly to the south of the true north-eastern line from Lakamat Ash Shub up to the desert, now agreed to as the basis of the north-east demarcation, and con sequently fall within the limits of the district of the “ nine cantons.” 20. Since they reoccupied Yaman in 1870—73, the Turks have only once o ^ qq ico penetrated in the direction of Beda, the small town of Rada being their starting point. Should the tribes report a Turkish movement into the Ghana mi or Malgami outlaying dependencies of Beda, we should, I think, even before the coaclusion of a treaty with Beda, be entitled to protest on the ground that these places are mainly south of the true north-east line to the desert now recognized by the Turks as in principle the boundary line in those regions. 9 [C275PD]* Pro.

The Turkish Commissioner at Sheikh Said being personally most anxi ous for a speedy settlement and at the same time unaware that we were pre pared not to insist on the definite recognition of the Aulaki and dependencies as one of the nine tribes, telegraphed on March 22nd, 1905 (please see my telegram No. 9* of March 21th, 1905, to the British t secret e„ March 1904, Nos. 83 199 .

With the somewhat important exception of Beda, the Turkish Com- I Pro No. so in secret e., August 1904 , Noi. ic* rnissioner has now accepted substantially si. the desiderata set forth in the Government of India’s || telegram of July 14th, 1904, to the Secretary of State for India. I may also point out that in the case of all four of the nine tribes whose borders have come under the delimitation {i.e., the Yafa’, Amiri, Haushabi and Subaihi), considerably more has been obtained than had been expected previous to demar cation. The accepted basis of the latter being the tribal borders according to the status of 1901, the frontier laid down is, in places, not a natural one. This applies, perhaps, especially to the section of the Haushabi border which crosses the Addareja valley between Basesa and Ras Namis instead of following the natural line of the crest of Jabal-Am-Amma and Jahal Jarban down to Pro No. 49 iu Secret E. ( June iv04. Nos. 22 - Jalisu {vide paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 132, and maps. of the Commission’s No. 19^[ of March 15th, 1904). 23 I understand projects are under consideration for the construction of a light railway from Aden up the Tiban valley to the Haushabi border presum ably somewhere in the vicinity of Addareja, and it was with a view to the possibility of a railway termimus in that neighbourhood that the Boundary Commission endeavoured, with success, to arrange that the principal water- supplies to the south of J. Am-Amma, should be left on the British side of the line. Should these railway projects be realized, the trade of the fertile districts near Taiz and Ibb would be tapped and there would certainly he an increase of traffic and business in and around Mavia, with a corresponding increase of Turkish Customs “ activity ” in the valley north of Addareja. In such an even tuality the necessity for a rectification of the boundary to the crest of J. Am-Amma, etc., would probably be more seriously felt than at present. 24. Though the status of 1901 precluded the possibility of taking the boundary along the natural line of the crests of the hills at the time of demar- ** Pro. No. 49 in Secret E, June 1904. Nob. 22 * CatlOU, the Arabic documents attached to 32. the Boundary Commission’s No. 19** of March 15th, 1904, show that tribally the Haushahi Sultan might he entitled to claim the Am*Amma-Jarban-Jalisa line, a rectification that would be more acceptable to the Wajibi and Shamera villagers now that the Haushabi Sultan Ali Mana has replaced the lately deceased Sultan Mohsin and the latter’s harsh rule has given place to the more conciliatory methods of his successor. 25. Copies of all documents and maps of the south-west Suhaihi frontier have also been forwarded, as usual, for transmission to the Government of India, Foreign Department, the Government of Bombay, the Secretary of State for India and His Majesty’s Ambassadar, Constantinople. The maps and descrip tion of boundary sent to the Government of India will, I presume, be forwarded to the Surveyor General of India with a view to the completion of the final boundary maps required for ratification at Constantinople. 1026. With, reference to the large scale map of Sheikh S lid, the boundary between J. Kuwah and Husn Murad had, according to my instructions, to be drawn so as to pass a certain distance inland from the actual shore line while leaving the village of Turba and its wells on the Turkish side. In the original survey the coast line was slightly inaccurate and the alteration shown on the map is by Captain Bond, R.E. 27. I have handed over the archives of the Boundary Commission to the Political Resident, Aden.

Numan situated on the watershed between the Bed Sea and the Gulf of Aden, on the condition, however, that the Imperial Ottoman Govern ment undertakes never to alienate to a third Power the territory lying between this latter line and the above-mentioned line of Akama, Akkar and Kudam ; that as the result of pour-parlers between the two friendly Governments, the British Embassy at Constantinople had just informed him that instructions m the above sense have been despatched by the Sublime Porte to tne Ottoman Commissioner. Colonel Mustapba Remzi Bey states that he has in fact received through the Imperial Ministry of War instructions dated the 6-19 March and based on an Imperial Irade Pf His Imperial Majesty the Sultan ordermg h.m so delimit the border of the Subehi Canton by a line terminating at Husn Murad, and that according to the instructions which have reached him, the Sublime i Porte uStonever to alienate to a third Power the territory adjoining and | situated to the north of the is uman*Husn-Murad line. Thereupon the two Commissioners draw up a detailed description^ of the section of the frontier between Barb Am ’Ashara (LXV) and the terminus at Husn Murad, and draw this line on the maps which they sign and exchange. As regards the part of the frontier north-east _ of the line which, according to the Imperial Irade ot 12th Febr „ ary igoatN.s.) ftarts from Lakamat-Es-Shub and proceeds in a north-east direction up to the desert Mr. Eitzmaurice, British Commisssioner, states that, as one portion of this line, i.e ,the Shabi-Mares border, has already been demarcated, there remains the question of fixing a basis for prolonging this line up to the desert; that, in virtue of the Imperial Irade above quoted, this part of t e demarcation should follow, in general, the true north-east line fr °“ ^ a “ at ' Es Shub up to the desert, except of course such- deviations as the features ot • the ground P may necessitate ; and that the documents and other proofs furnished bv the Sheikhs of Yafa, establish indisputably that the places called Rube Aten, Nawa and Dabiani form part of the Canton of Yafa, while the Antaki fnlur : Awalik) with all their subdivisions and dependencies, as also all other Yafa districts lying to the south and east of the aforesaid north-eas me | belong to the “ Niue Cantons.”.

As regards the first point (a) mentioned by Captain Tandy, my distinct recollection is that, when I visited the col in question with Shekh Rabbash (Head Shekh of the Haiki Sub Tribe) and his followers they gave the name of the spot as Barh A1 Haima, a version which tallied with that given independently to one of the Turkish Commissioners; that Captain Tandy's native surveyor brought in a different name for the place, and that I again visited the col with thethe Turkish Chief Comnissioner, Colonel Mustapha Rerazi Bey, accompanied by natives who again gave the name as Barh A1 Raima. The Joint Commission, ac cordingly accepted that version as correct and it was inserted in the description of the boundary. There seems then no ground for altering it. As regards (b) I think the description of the line as 'following the watershed' and 'passing through Jebel Sin Sanfa* is not incorrect. My enquiries on the spot were to the effect that the lofty sharply- pointed pinnacle, mentioned by Captain Tandy, was called simply Sin Sanfa, or 'Tooth of Sanfa' (from its resemblance to a tooth) while the hill, of which it was the most praninent feature, was known to the nativesnatives as Jebel Sanfa, or Jebel Sin Sanfa. The description obviously refers to a line pass ing along the water parting of Jebel Sin Sanfa, and is not, I think, open to misconception. 3. As regards the third point (c), the des cription makes the boundary proceed 'in a straight line to the top of J. Kuwah' and not to the highest point of J. Kuwah, as it was at first intended to describe it. On visiting the locality in last April, I noticed that the Cairn erected by Captain Tandy did not seem to be quite the highest point and it was therefore decided to take the line to the point tri angulated by Captain Tandy and to make it thence fol low 'the heights' to LXX. As both points, between whichwhich there is a difference in height of only 4 or 5 feet* are, so to speak, on the top of J. Kuwah, it would appear that* if the map with the line on it be compared with the ground, there can be no mi sunder« standing as to where the boundary runs and consequent ly no necessity for altering the description. There would then seem to be no reason for delaying sending the maps to press. (Signed) G. H. Fitzmaurlce. London, August 3rd, 1905.r'k ! ♦ opy. lo. 502. THERAPIA. July 25th, 1905.

I need, however, hardly point out to Your Lord- ship that it will be very difficult at the present moment to make any alterations or modifications in the Proces Verbaux signed by the British and Turkish Commissioners and further that such a course must necessarily delay the exchange of maps &amp;c., of the Boundary Question. # I have » V (Signed) N.

Sir:- With refei*ence to the documents and maps recently forwarded by to. Fitzmauriee to Your Excellency direct in connection with the recent local settlement of the Aden Boundary, I am directed to forward herewith for Your Excellency 1 s consideration a copy of a letter from Captain M. O f C. Tandy, R.E., formerly British Survey Officer with the Aden Boundary Commission, in which he draws attention to discrepancies between the descriptions and the maps signed by the British and Turkish Commissioners. Captain Tandy*s references are to the text of an English description signed by Mr. Fitzmaurice alone. The substance of his re marks, however, applies equally to the jointly signed documentdocunent in French, 2. Your Excellency will, no doubt, after con sultation with Mr. Fitzmaurlce consider whether the points raised under (b) and (e) in regard to Jabel Sin Sanfa and Jebel Kuwah are of sufficient import ance to make it advisable to attempt a revision of the jointly signed description of the kind suggested by Captain Tandy. 3. No action is being taken on Captain Tandy’s suggestion for the Insertion of Barh-ol-Mujariba in the final map which will be exactly as signed by the Boundary Commissioners. I have &amp;c., (Signed) S. M. Fraser.!opy. My dear Somers Cocks:- I return herewith the description of the Aden Boundary from Barh am 'Ashara to the sea which you sent me with your demi official letter of the 13th instant. 1. With regard to this part of the boundary there are three points to which I should like to call your attention viz: (a) The description of the boundary states 'Prom J. Human the line turns .... pass ing through the points • • the name of this Col should be Barh al Mujariba. While the survey was taking place both Col.Wahab and Mr. Pitzmaurice decided that this was a suitable spot for the boundary to traverse and its correct name was therefore carefully ascertained. Mr. Fitzmaurice has, I fancy, forgotten the correct name and to identify the point has called it after thendarest/ village. Which nanie shall I put on the fin al naps? (b) In the same paragraph of the description the line is said 'to pass through J. Sin Sanfa' whereas on the map the red line stops nearly a mile short of this hill and then passes about a mile and a half to the East of It. This hill which is visible from the sea and which forms a very noticeable feature in the country culminates (as its name implies) in a lofty, isolated and sharply pointed pinnacle so that the name does not refer to the range but only to the point marked with a triangle ( ) on the map. In this case the intention of the Commissioners was undoubted ly that the boundary should run as shown on the map and, in order that the description should agree with the map, either the word 'J. Sin Sanfa' should be om itted or the description might be amended somehow as follows: 'From J. Human the line turns . . . . passing through the points . . . . Nijd am Rahaz (54); to the hill about 1 kilometer North of J.J. Sin Sanfa and thence by Barh Mashari to the summit of J. Jariba.* (c) The description (under heading LXVIII states 'It (the boundary) then descends . . . . in a straight line to the top of J. Kuwah'. Now on J. Kuwah there are two points of almost equal height, from the western and slightly the lower of these two points I made some observations and at this point I built a small rubble cairn, this point is shown on the map by a triangle ( ) and to this point the boundary line has been drawn by the Commissioners, it is not however the true top of the hill and anyone trying to fix the boundary on the ground from the des cription would undoubtedly go to the highest (i.e. the eastern) point, the difference in height between the two points is about 4 or 5 feet and they are about 150 yards apart, a distance which can be clearly shown on the large scale on which Sheikh Said has been sur veyed. It is impossible to say what were the inten tions of the Conmissioners, if they meant the boundary toto run as shown on the map to the small cairn which I built, the description should be altered 'the western summit of J. Kuwah' being substituted for the top of J. Kuwait', but if they wished the boundary to run to the highest point of J. Kuwah the line as drawn in red by the Commissioners should be altered. 2. The above may seem small points to you but I feel it is my duty to bring them to your notice and hope you will be able to give me instructions about them at an early date as until you do so I shall be unable to send the maps to press.

I replied that, without making any admissions as to the rights of I lance at Sheikh Said, 1 was able to say at once that the frontier line, as we proposed to draw it, would strike the coast at a point considerably further south'than that place. It was therefore not necessary that the question of Sheikh Said should be discussed between us. [January 11.] The Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir F. Bertie. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) LANSDOWNE.

I said that his Excellency’s recollection was correct, although we had not admitted that the French had any rights to that place.

His Excellency cited his communication of the 18th January as toKoweit, of the 8th March as to the occupation of Menawa, in the neighbourhood of Bahrein, of the 8th April upon the same subject, and of the 3rd instant in regard to Koweit. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) LANSDOWNE. [1973 r —3]&amp; [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] THE Turkish Ambassador called upon me to-day, and I took advantage of the opportunity to mention to him several matters which have recently formed the subject of discussions between yourself and the Turkish Government. After touching on the obstructive attitude which the Turkish Government had adopted during the six months preceding the final settlement of the Aden frontier, I pointed out to his Excellency that while Railway Concessions with heavy kilometric guarantees were being constantly granted to foreign Companies, the only British line in Asia Minor, the Smyrna-Aidin Railway, which was self-supporting and enjoyed no such guarantee, was persistently refused the extension which it urgently requires. The representations of His Majesty’s Ambassador in support of the Company were disregarded, and the attitude of the Porte constituted, in effect, an unfriendly discrimination against British enterprise. I then mentioned the arbitrary withdrawal from the British Steam-ship Companies in the Persian Gulf of privileges in regard to supplies of coal, which they had enjoyed for many years, and the repeated refusal of the Sublime Porte to grant to the British Khedivial Mail Company coaling facilities similar to those permitted to all other foreign mail-steamers entering the port of Constantinople. These complaints had been the subject of representations not only by His Majesty’s Embassy at Constan tinople, but also by myself to his Excellency, but up to the present time nothing whatever had been done to meet them. I added that further grounds for dissatisfaction were :— The obstructive attitude of the Sublime Porte towards all British mining enter prise in Turkey and the refusal of concessions to British subjects, even in cases where they have incurred large sacrifices in preliminary operations with the full consent of the Turkish Government. Again, the Sublime Porte had up to the present time failed to fulfil its solemn promises to pay within a specified period to the British concessionnaires the remaining moiety, with interest, of the purchase-money of the Haifa-Damascus Railway. The treatment by the Turkish Government of the British firms interested in the construction of ships of war and the provision of munitions of war had also been singularly unfair. British ship-building firms had modified their terim in accordance with the demands of the Turkish authorities but without result, while the tenders made by British manufacturers of arms at the invitation of the Imperial authorities had been subsequently rejected in favour of the less advantageous offers of foreign rivals. In neither case had any explanation been vouchsafed of the conduct of the Turkish authorities. . I furnished his Excellency with a Memorandum corresponding with the observa tions which 1 had made, and he undertook to communicate the substance of them to the Turkish Government. . , . . Before leaving my room his Excellency handed to me an aide •memoir e, in vhich it was stated that a report had lately been received by the Porte from the Vali of Bussorah to the effect that four British war-ships, which were at that moment at Koweit, were, notwithstanding the opposition of the Sheikh, carrying out _ certain operations in the neighbourhood of Djehre, Beana, and Umkasr as a preliminaiy to the construction of fortifications around Koweit Such proceedings were, hk Excel lency said, of a nature to constitute a violation of the status quo, of which the maintenance at Koweit had been agreed upon by the two Governments, and he was instructed to call my attention to the matter. I asked his Excellency what evidence there was to corroborate the Vali state ment that the presence of these British ships had anything whatever to do with the construction of fortifications in the neighbourhood of Koweit. I thought we ia&lt; good reasons for complaining of the manner in which such allegations were con- [1973 c—2] ARABIA. [May 3.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. {Vi; The Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir N.

I HAVE the honour to transmit the Report .by Mr. Fitzmaurice of the 30th April on the Subaihi border and north-east. 2. With regard to his remarks on Beda, paragraphs 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, I beg to point out that I have been and am now taking steps to induce the Chief of that tribe to enter into the Treaty sanctioned by Government. I understand one of the main obstacles in the past has been the local jealousies amongst the Beda Chief and minor Sheikhs, which I trust however to be able to overcome, and I am not without hope that within a reasonable time that the Treaty in question will be concluded, unless perhaps the present troubles in Temen should bave a disturbing effect on the British side of the border. A fuller report on the subject will follow by next mail. 3. The settlement of the south-west border (Suhaihi) appears to me ^ to be satisfactory, whilst it has also been a great advantage to nave the north-east line put in principle on a more definite basis. By the wording of the proces-verbai Mr. Fitzmaurice has not expressly recognized Juban as Turkish, and to a certain extent this would seem to leave the matter open, should the claims of Yafa’ and the general circumstances of the case, in the event of any future demarcation of the north-east boundary, render it expedient to insist on its connection. I would also venture to point out that the words “ at the moment of demarcation ” in the proces-verbai, would appear to be a certain limitation on our cession^of the Subaihi territory between the boundary actually delimited and the Akama-Eudam line. 4. In forwarding the last Boundary Commission Report by Mr. Fitzmaurice, I beg to place on record my appreciation of the good work he nas done in connection [2040 g—1] 13i 2 with the boundary. Apart from his actual services^ in connection with demarcation, I have always found him ready to help me with his advice and experience in many matters which 1. have consulted him on, and that his assistance os the result ot his long experience in the hinterland has been of much value to me.

IN accordance with the Government of India s instructions, conveyed to me in the British Ambassador’s telegram of the 18th instant, I have, as reported in my telegram of the 20th instant, settled with the Turkish Commissioner the outstanding portion of some 60 miles of the south-west frontier of the Subehi, as also the questions expressly included in the recent negotiations with the Turks respecting the north-east houndarv-line to the desert I forward herewith the maps ( 2 -inch to the mile, geneial map, and large scale map of the Sheikh Said Peninsula) with the houndary- line marked thereon, as also a detailed description of this section of the irontier, all duly signed by Colonel Mustapha Remzi, the Ottoman Commissioner. This brings up the total extent of boundary actually delimited with the Turks to about 200 miles from point I on the Wadi Bana to Husn Murad at Sheikh Said. 2. I further inclose the signed proces-verbal in Trench (with a translation m English) of the last official meeting of the Joint Commission. In it will be found mentioned the arrangement communicated by the Sublime Porte in a note verbale, dated the 14th March last, to His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople concerning the undertaking given by the Ottoman Government not to alienate to a third rower the Subehi territory lying between the line actually delimited from J. Nuinan to Husn Murad and the line of the old Subehi border from J. ’Akama through J. Akkar to Kudam on the shore of the Red Sea. 3. The wording of the Porte’s note is vague in not giving the north-western limits (i.e., ’Akama and Kudam) of the territory to which the non-alienation Agree ment refers, but I understand the British Ambassador has subsequently obtame from the Sublime Porte a statement in writing indicating more precisely the territory to which the arrangement refers. (Vide Secretary of State xor India s telegram 0 t is 4th April to the Government of India, Foreign Department.) 4. The tenour of the official telegram on the subject from the Ottoman Minister of War to the Turkish Commissioner, dated the 19th March, 1905, was as follows . “ The British Government has wished to impose a condition that the Impeiial Government shall never cede to a third Power the territory situated between the Akama-Kudam line and the second line terminating at Husn Murad, which you are hereby instructed to delimit. Such, a condition could not be deemed worthy 0 discussion even, but the Ottoman Ambassador in London has made a communication concerning the territory adjoining the Husn Murad line which the British loieign Minister has accepted as a sufficient pledge on the subject.” When urged to insert in the proces-verbal the words ‘ r Akama and Kudam, ^ as the northern limits of the territory in question, the Turkish Commissioner demune , saying that, in view of the above instructions, he could only agree to the mention 0 “ the territory adjoining the Murad line,” and that the reference might even )Q 0 the territory to the south of that line. He subsequently agreed to the woicmg, “ adjoining and to the north of the Numan-Murad line.” _ 5. With regard to the section of the Subehi border from J. Numan to A™ Murad, as finally drawn on the accompanying maps, it may be remarked fha ie Boundary Commission, on entering the Subehi country, was given to understanci the western Subehi frontier passed by J. Am Missas and thence skirted the souU j slopes of the hills, reaching the sea in the vicinity of Turba, while it was lounc the Turks locally laid claim to all the territory east of Sheikh Said up to the nu J. Am Missas, J. Kharaz, and Ras Arab.^. Subsequently, mvestigations showed that the western borders of the .TnlAi : Buretnx, and Atxh sections of the Subehi extended respectively to the po nts ’ ’ ama Akkar, and Kudam and although these extreme limits have not been instted on Tim boundary actually delimited from J. Numan to Hum Murad still vindicates e ™ m 1lT’ZXKr^ Prete r n8 { t0 the -tent Of^tntodstf squaie mile^ Ihe luiks had m the past unobtrusively exercised iurisdiction tin to r the hne ot J Am Missas and J. Kharaz, the Subehi tribal subsections of Mudariba offic,ls)t Motlia 1W ’ and haYine aotuaU y P aid ‘axes to the Ottoman 7. The Turkish Commissioners at first insisted strongly on their claim to the Aghban, mainly on account of the religious importance attached bv their authorities to the well-known shrine of Turba Ahu-el-Esrar, situated within Aghbari limits- and ShT, * e « C0U T-° f the ° tt0man tjommissioner’s recent prolonged stay at Sheikh Said that the claim w^as relinquished. The result was to yield' a naturai boundary, which from J. .Human, almost entirely follows the watershed between the bed Sea and the Gulf ot Aden, is easily distinguishable, and has the further merit of being the recognized border between the tribal subsections inhabiting the country through which it passes. ‘ r 8 Despite the general barren character of the country this section of the frontier has also the advantage that it can be easily visited by large or small parties as sufficient water tor a camp of from 300 to 400 men is to be found at short 1 stages' or marches along its entire extent. At Mijza there is abundant flowing water, and similarly at Mudariba, some 8 miles to the west of Mijza. The wells at Turba Abu- el-Esrar, some 8 miles north-west of Mudariba, yield a fair amount of good water, and water is also to be had in the Upper reaches of the Wadis Batan and Barrukhia, while there is a plentiful spring at Ghail Hurim (the point marked 1575 on the^-inch map), in Wadi Hurim. Water is also obtainable lower down the same wadi, at the point 1120, due south of J„ Jariba, as also at Am Habia and Sukaiya, which have each a fair supply of good drinking water. ^ rf**) 9. The Memoranda forwarded with the Commission’s letters of the 4th June, 1904, and the oth June, 1904, contain the information obtainable from native sources as to French and Turkish past dealings at Sheikh Said, and their hearing on Subehi rights to the place. The Hakmi Sheikh Thabit Am Duren was the individual with whom the French dealt, while Sheikh Mohammad Ali Fattahi was confidentially employed by both French and Turks, as appears from his evidence given in the Memoranda above referred to. Both Sheikhs, who were very advanced in years, .died early in last February, two interesting links with the past history of Sheikh Said being thus removed. 10. In accordance with the instructions contained in the Secretary of State for India’s telegram of the 18th April to the Government of India, two masonry pillars in cement (3 feet at the base and 5 feet high) have been built under the supervision of Lieutenant H. J. Couchman, K.E., at the points LX X I and LXXIX in the vicinity of Sheikh Said, while the Turkish Commissioner has had a cairn of rough stone, about 2 metres in height, erected at the point LXX. 11. The proces-verbal records the definition of the north-east boundary line from Lakamat-ash-Shub to the desert agreed upon with the Turkish Commissioner, as also the places and tribes definitely recognized as on the British side of such a line. By the Sultan’s Irade of February 1903 the Turkish Commissioners were instructed “to delimit in a north-easterly direction from Lakamat-ash-Shub towards the desert,” but, as shown in paragraph 4 of the Commission’s letter of the 1st October, 1903, they then considered that they had carried out their instructions to demarcate in a north easterly direction when they had delimited to point I on the W. Sana. The specific admission that Lube’aten, Xa’wa, and Dabiani belong to Tala’ now definitely carries the line some 20 miles further in the north-easterly direction. 12. As may be noticed from the wording of the proces-verbal, I have not expressly surrendered Yafa’s rights to Juban, but have merely omitted all mention of their claim to the place, although the Ottoman Commissioner’s admission that Bmbe’aten, Na’wa, and Dabiani belong to Yafa’ is conditional on Juban remaining part of the liaza of Rada. I may point out that the basis of demarcation accepted by both Governments was the status of 1901, and that at that time all four places were considered as Turkish, while the Aden Residency records of 1894 mentioned Rube’aten, Na’wa, and Juban as being within Turkish limits. Thus, in obtaining the recognition by the Turks that .Rube’aten, Xa’wa, and Dabiani are Yafa’, we are obtaining more than the status4 of 1901 warranted. According to the document inclosed in the Commission s letter of the 26th October, 1903, Rube’aten is so indisputably Yafa’ that it could not have been left to the Turks without a loss of prestige vis-a-vis our tribesmen, but the Yafa connection with the other places in question is much weaker. , ^ 13 The words in the pvoces-vcvbcil &lt;c as also all other Yafa districts lying to the south and east of the aforesaid north-east line ” are intended to cover Reyu, an appanage of the Yafa’ Sultan Haidara Muhammad of Mali]aba, and also Ahl Said-al- Mashrik, a small nomad tribal section related to Dabiani, should the i arks, at the moment of demarcation, desire to dispute their Yafa connection. 14. The statement of the Ottoman Commissioner quoted m the proces-verbal that the basis of the north-east demarcation is in general the north 45 east line, or true north-east line from Lakamat-ash-Shub up to the desert, entitles us to consider at the least, all tribes to the south and east of the true north-east line as within the British sphere. 15. The specific admission that the Aulaki with all its sub-dii isions and dependencies are one of the “nine cantons” completes the list of the nine tribes which the Porte since 1873 was supposed to have recognized as British ike late Resident telegram of the 20th December, 1903, states that the Aulaki Sultan claims suzerainty over Behan-al-Kasab. If this is so, in fact, the district is a depenclenc} o the Aulaki. I believe, moreover, a Treaty was concluded early m 1904 with Sharif Ahmad Mohsin of Behan-al-Kasab. . rn . ,, . . 16. The recent demarcation tvas proposed by the Sultan oi Turkey on the basis of the “nine cantons,” he., the nine British tribes notified to the Porte m 18/3. As Beda was not one of these, it became imperative vis-a-vis the Turkish Government, as repeatedly pointed out by the Commission, to enter into Treaty engagements with Beda as early as possible, and notify the same to the Porte so as to bring it wit im the scope of His Majesty’s Government’s declaration in 1873 that it reserved the right to make fresh Treaties with the tribes. The hitch in concluding a Treaty with Beda (vide Resident’s telegram to Poreign Representative, Simla, of the 12th May, 1904) and its consequent omission from the notification to the ^ Porte of the lit i August, 1904, made it, with its dependencies, the one serious gap in the north-eastern line 17. Were a joint Anglo-Turkish Mission to proceed as far as the north-eastern limits of Dabiani, the Turkish Commissioners would refuse to recognize Beda as within our sphere, and a prolonged delay would occur before precise orders on the subject could* be obtained and reach them from Constantinople. It is true that the words in the proces-verbal, “in general the N. 45 E. line up to t e c eser , imply that Beda, &amp;c., are on the British side of the line, but a Turkish Commission on the spot would, nevertheless, probably maintain that Beda and its dependencies are part of the Turkish administrative sub-district of Rada. 18. As a protracted stay in the Dabiani country, a barren tract, where commu nications are execrable and transport difficulties very great, would be most costly, if not, indeed, dangerous, it would seem essential that, before any Joint Commission ever undertakes the north-eastern demarcation, the Turkish Government shoulc e induced to send categorical instructions to the Yaman authorities to recognize - e a with its dependencies as belonging to the district of the “ nine cantons. 19. For that purpose, after a Treaty is concluded with Beda, the Porte cou c e reminded that His Majesty’s Government, in notifying the original nine tribes to ie Ottoman Government in 1873, had specially reserved the right to enter into ies i engagements of the sort, and informed that such arrangements had been conciuaea with Beda and, perhaps also Behan-al-Kasab, which lie mainly to the south o ae true north-eastern line from Lakamat-ash-Shub up to the desert, now agreed to as tno basis of the north-eastern demarcation, and consequently fall within the limits o ie district of the nine cantons. 20. Since they re-occupied Yemen, in 1870-73, the Turks have only once p &lt; trated in the direction of Beda, the small town of Rada being their starting P 0 ^ 11 ^ Should the tribes report a Turkish movement into the Ghanami or Malgami ou y 11 ^ dependencies of Beda, we should, I think, even before the conclusion of a f rea M Avith Beda, be entitled to protect, on the ground that these places are main a sou of the true north-eastern line to the desert, now recognized by the lurks as principle the boundary line in those regions. . f 21. The Turkish Commissioner at Sheikh Said being personally most anxious io a speedy settlement, and at the same time unaware that we were prepared not to msmo on the definite recognition of the Aulaki and dependencies as one of the nine tn ,0 f 2ll A d ¥ al ' ch j 19 °® (l ,lease . see my telegram No. 9 of the 24th March a 9 °, %• i 1 rltl t S1 mliassador, Constantinople), pointing out that “as Nisab, the Aulaki head-quarters lay well south of the N. 45° B. line implied in the Imperial Irade of the 12th February 1903 (i.e., the 30th January, 1318, Turkish date?, the Aulaki and dependencies would appear to have been impliedly admitted as one of the nine cantons. _ On the 2nd April he received a telegraphic reply from the Minister ' Tul°r beha - lf ° f th , e . Grand Vizier = «iat “in View of the statements m his (i.e the Turkish Commissioner’s) telegram of the 22nd March, there was no reason to hesitate about the status of Aulaki as one of the nine cantons.” I give these details, as a reference to them may be useful, should Beda and Behan ever become the subject of discussion with the Sublime Porte. 22. With the somewhat important exception of Beda, the Turkish Commissioner has now accepted substantially the desiderata set forth in the Government of India’s telegram of the 14th July, 1904, to the Secretary of State for India. I may also ponit out that m the case of all four of the nine tribes whose borders have come under t ie elimitation (i.e., the lafa , Amiri, Haushabi, and Subehi), considerably more has been obtained than had been expected previous to demarcation. The accepted basis of the latter being the tribal borders according to the status of 1901, the frontier laid a na tural one. This applies, perhaps, especiallv to the section of the Haushabi border which crosses the Addareja Valley between Basesa and Has IN amis, instead of following the natural line of the crest of Jabal-am-Amma and Jabal Jarban down to Jalisa (vide paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the Commission’s No. 19 of the loth March, 1904). 23. I understand projects are under consideration for the construction of a liMit railway from Aden up the liban Valley to the Haushabi border, presumably some where in the vicinity of Addareja, and it was with a view to the possibility of a railway terminus in that neighbourhood that the Boundary Commission endeavoured, with success, to arrange that the principal water supplies to the south of Jabal-am- Amma^ should be left on the British side of the line. Should these railway projects be realized, the trade of the fertile districts near Taiz and Ibb would be tapped, and there would certainly be an increase of traffic and business in and around Mavia, with a corresponding increase of Turkish Customs cc activity” in the valley north of Addareja. In such an eventuality the necessity for a ratification of the boundary to the crest of Jabal-am-Amma, &amp;c., would probably be more seriously felt than at present. 24. Though the status of 1901 precluded the possibility of taking the boundary along the natural line of the crests of the hills at the time of demarcation, the Arabic documents attached to the Boundary Commission’s No. 19 of the 15th March, 1904, show that tribally the Haushabi Sultan might be entitled to claim the Am Amma- Jarban-Jalisa line, a rectification that would be more acceptable to the Wajihi and Shamera villagers now that the Haushabi Sultan ALi Mana has replaced the lately deceased Sultan Mohsin, and the latter’s harsh rule has given place to the more conciliatory methods of his successor. 25. Copies of all documents and maps of the south-west Subehi frontier have also been forwarded, as usual, for transmission to the Government of India, Eoreign Department, the Government of Bombay, the Secretary of State for India, and His Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople. The maps and description of boundary sent to the Government of India will, I presume, be forwarded to the Surveyor-General of India with a view to the completion of the final boundary maps required for ratification at Constantinople. 26. With reference to the large scale map of Sheikh Said, the boundary between Jabal Kuwah and Husn Murad had, according to my instructions, to be drawn so as to pass a certain distance inland from the actual shore line, while leaving the village of Turba and its wells on the Turkish side. In the original survey the coast line was slightly inaccurate, and the alteration shown on the map is by Captain Bond, H.E, 27. I have handed over the archives of the Boundary Commission to the Political Besident, Aden. They contain such a large number of documents referring to other than purely boundary matters, that I have thought it useful for future reference to subjoin a list of the principal documents having a direct bearing on the different sections of the frontier.

I forward herewith the maps (to the mile, general map and 1/40,000 large scale map of the Shaikh Said Peninsula) with the boundary line marked thereon, as also a detailed des cription of this section of the frontier, all duly signed by Colonel Mustapha Kesud the Ottoman Commissioner * This brings up the total extent of boundary actually delimited 9 with the Turks to about 200 miles from Point I ©n the Wadi Bana to Husn :^urad at Sheikh Said. 2. I further enclose the signed proces-verbal in Trench (with a translation in English) cf the last offipird meeting of the loint Commission. In it will be found men tioned the arrangement communicated by the Sublime Porte in a Hot© Verbal©, dated arch 14th 1905, to H.

Such a condition could 'not be deemed worthy of discussion even, but the Ottoman 'Ambassador in London has made a communication concerning % 'the territory adjoining the HUSH HUB AD line, which the 'British foreign Minister ha© accepted as a sufficient 'pledge on the subject'. When urged to insert in the pro* ca s-verbal the words f AKAMA ind KUDA1- as the northern limits of the territory in question, the Turkish Com-nis ei oner demurred, saying that, in view of the above insiruc tions, he could only agree to the mention of 'the territoiy 'adjoining the MJBAD line' and that the reference might ev&amp;i be to the territory to the South of that line. He subse quently agreed to the wording 'adjoining and to the Horth 'of the line'. 5. With reg:urd to the section of the SRIBIHI border from J. HIPv-AH to HU OH bUKAD as finally drawn on the accompanying3 Roct'mpEnv ing mEp&amp;, it mEy 'b® roxi&amp;rkftd tliat til® Boundary COruniBsion, on entering the StfBEIII eountry, was given to understand that the Western SUBBHI frontier passed by J. AM 1UBSAS and thence skirted the southern slopes cf the hills, reaching the sea in the vicinity of TUB BA, while it was found, that the Turks locally laid claim to all the territory east of SHKH SAID up to the line of J. AM MISSIS J. KHAHA2 and BAS ABAH. 6. S bsequently investigations showed that the ern borders of the JUXSDI, BURffll and ATIJT sections of the SUBTTUC extended respectively to the points 1 AK’AIA, &lt; AJ&amp;- KAB and KTOAM and, although these extreme limits have not been Insisted on, the boundary actually delimited from J. OTMAlf to HUSU MUQI still vindicates the SUBBHI claime&gt; as against Ti; ( rkish pretensions: to the extent of some hup-sda of aqjiare ralloa. Thi Turk# h*d, in th* past, oa&gt; C obtrusively exercised jurisdiction up to the line of J, AM V &lt; MXSSAS md J. ^iABAy, the STTBBRI tribal subsections of OTBABIBA, AOHBABI, TALTIU ,?iAHl r AI#I and JABTJUThaving ac tually paid, taxes to the ot oman officials at MOEHA* 7• The Turkish Commissioners at first insisted strongly on their claim., to the AGHBABI, mainly on account of the religious importance attached by their authorities to the well-known shrine of TUBBA ABU AX ISBAB situated within ACHBABX limits, and it was only in the course of the Ottoman Commissi ner*s recent prolonged stay at 8KHKH SAID that the claim was relinquished. The result was to yield a natural boundary which from J. MIMAH almost entire* &gt;■ ly follows the watershed between th® Bed Sea and the Gulf of Aden, is easily distinguishable and has the further merit of being the recognized border between the tribal subsections inhabiting the country through which it passes*^ 8. Despite the general barren character of the coun try this section of the frontier has also the advantage 4' / v /v thatit can 'be easily visited by large or sa : 11 parties^ as sufficient ater for a camp of from 300 to 400 man la % be found at short stages or marches along Its entire extent At MUZA there Is abundant flowing water and similarly at MUBARIBA some 8 miles to the west of MUZA. The wells at TUHBA ABU AI XSRAH, soma 8 miles M.

Water is lao obtainable lower down the same wadi at the point 1180 due moMth of X. JAEIBA, a© at m HABIA and SUKAIYA, ^hich have each a fair supply of good drinking water. 9. The memoranda forwarded with the Commission*s 41 of June 4th 1904 and ho. 42 of June 8th 1904 contain the information cbtainabl© from native sources as to french and Turk!eh past dealing© at SHKHT SAID and their bearing , on nrnFHI rights t© the place. The HAKMI Slhekh Tlmbit Am Duran was the individual with Whom th French dealt, while f?hekh Mohammad All F&amp;tt&amp;hi was confidentially employed by hath French and Turks, as appears from his evidence given in the memoranda above referred to. Both Shekhs, who worn very advancei in years, died early in last February, two interesting links with th© past history of SFjBKH SAID bei^g tJius removed. 10. In accordance with the instructions contained in th© Secretary ©f-State for India’s telegram of April 18th to the Government of India, two masonry pillars in cement (3 feet at the base and 5 feet high) have b en built, under the supervision of Lieut: H. J. Couchman, K.

E. direction when they had delimited to Point I on the W. BAKA. The specific admission that HUHE 1 ATEIT, $A f WA and BABIAtl belong to YAlU* now definitely carrier the line some twenty miles further in the If. E. direction* 12. A© may he noticed from the wording of the proces » ' I verbal, I have not expressly surrendered YAFA*o rights to JUBAT but have tmrel^r omit ,ed all mention of their cluim to the place, although the Ottoman Commissioner* s admission that HUHE^ATM, M K ¥A*WA and BABIAHI belong to YAPA* is conditional on JTOAH re maining part of the of HADA* I may point out that the basis of demarcation accepted by both Governments was the status of 1901 and that at that time all four places were considered as Turkish, while the Aden Re sidency records of 1094 mentioned ROTE*ATI U, UA*WA and JITBAH as being within Turkish limits. Thus in obtaining the recognition by the Turks that KOBE* ATM t fU^WA and BARI AMI are YAM*, we are obtaining iiore than the status of 1901 warranted. According to the document inclosed in tha Comil^ion* s !fo. 340 of October 26th 1903, RUhR*ATIIR is so indisputably YAEA* that it could not have been left to the Turks ’without a loss of prestige vis-a-vis our tribesmen, but the YATA* connection with the other places in question is much weaker. 13. The words in the proces-vsrbal 'as ilea all other ^YAFA* districts lying to the South and hast of the aforesaid •IT. B. iine w are intended to cover KEYU, an appanage of the YAFA* Sultan Haidara Huhammad of IfAliJABA, and also ML SAID AL YASHRIK, a small nomad tribal section related to DABIAIfl, shouid&amp; i © . r -0, at the moment of demrcation, desire to dispute their YAPA* connection. ' 14. The statement of the Ottoman Commissioner quoted in * the process-verbal that the basis of the N. *. demarcation is in general the ?T $ line, or true H. B. line from UKAMAT ASH nmm up to the desert entitles us |&lt;^'*t the least, all tribes to the South and last of tha trr* it v i &lt; true I. line as within the BrU tish sphere. 16. The specific admission that the AULAKI with all its subdivision® and dependencies are one of the -nine Cantons* com. I le-es the list cf the nine tribes which the Porte since 1673 was supposed to have recognised as British. The late Resident telegram of December 2Cth 19C3 states that the AUIAKI Sultan olaimr su^rainty over WUS AZ KASAB. If this is so in fact, tHe di8triei 18 * dependency of the AUI.AKI. I believe, more over, a treaty was concluded early in 1904 with Sharif Ahmad in of B1HA3T AX, KASAB. Ih ® recent demarcation was proposed by the Sultan of Turhey on the basis of the •nine cantons' i.a. the nine British tribes notified to the Porte in 1873. As HERA was not one of these, it became imperative vis-a-vis the Turkish G-overnwaAt, as repeatedly pointed out by the Co amission, to enter into trea ty engagements with BEDA as early as possible, and notify the fftme to the Thrte so as to bring it within the scope of H. M. Government'a declaration In 1673 that it reserved the right to majte free?; treaties with the tribes. She hitch in concluding a treaty with BEPA ( lr ide Resident* a telegram to Foreign Simla of hay 12th 1904) and its consequent omission/ from the notifica tion to the Porte of August 11th 1904 made it,with its dependen- clets,the one serious gap in the V. |. line. I,*. Were a Joint Anglo-Turkish Mission to proceed as far as the i . £• i.iaits of OABlAiil, toe Turkish CoBimisaloners would ret-ise to recogniae BEDA as within our sphere and a prole-ged eeiay would occur before precise orders on the subject could be .6 obtainedobtained and reach them from Constantinople. It is true that the words in the procee-verbal, 'in general th S« 45° 1 line **up to the desert* imply that 1 ? *K'DA &amp;c are on the British side of the line, but a I’urkieh Commission on the spot would* never theless, probably maintain that HEDA and its dependencies are part of the Turkish administrative subdistrict of EADA.

Since they reoccupied YAM AH in 1S70-73, the Turks havs only once penetrated in the direction of BHDA, the small town of BABA being thsir starting point. Should the tribes report a Turkish movement into the GEklWU or kAJ.GAJil outlying dependen cies of HKDA, we should, I think,, even before the conclusion of a treaty with BEDA, be entitled to protect on the ground that these places are mainly south of th© true M. E* line to the do* sert now recognised by the Turks as in principle the boundary line in those regions. 21 Th® Turkish Commissioner at SHEIKH SAID being person-a ally niost axixiovB tor a speedy sattlensnt and at the a&amp;mft time unaware that we war© prepared not t© insist on the definite re- cc. i ■ v)f the A1TIJJCI and dependencies as one of the nine 22nd ■ $ ^iegraphed on March A l9C5 (pXease telegrsp $r©« n . arc -i4tli 1905 to the British ■Ajah&amp;ssadorj Co nstantinopi©) pointing out that 'a© FISAB, the AUXAEI headquarters, lay mil * south of the If# 45° 2* line implied in the Imperial Trade of ** 7 elruarv 12tn 190S ( i *e * 30 J anuary 1318, Turkish date) , the •ATOAKI and dependencies would appear to have been implifdly adwit- w ted as one of the nine cantons. w On April 2nd he received a telegraphic reply from the Minister of Far informing him, on ■behalf of the Grand Vizier that 'in view of the statements in 9 * (i.e. the Turkish Commissioners) telegram of 'arch 22nd, 'there was no reason to hesitate about the status of AG1AKI as 'one of the nine Cantons.'

I may also point out that in the case of all four of the nine tribes whose borders have come under the delimitation (i.e. the YAFA*, AtTBI, HAUSHABI and StXBKHI), considerably more has been obtained than had bean expected previous to demarcation. The accepted basis of the latter being the tribal borders according to the status of 1901, the frontier laid down is, in places, not a natural one. This applies, perhaps, ©specially t© the section of the KAUSHABI border which crosses the ABBAR'JA valley between BAS1S&amp; and FAG • AAIS instead cf following the natural lin* of the crest of JABAL AH AMMA and JABAL JAHBAiT dc.|m to JALISA (Vide Pafa ?. r S , 9, 10 and' 11 of the CcrmnisBion’ s bo. 19 of '/..arch 15th 1904). * v' 23.

In such an eventuality the necessity for a rectification of the boundary to the crest of J. AM AMA &amp;c. would probably be more seriously felt than at present. 24. Though the status of 1901 precluded the possibility of taking the boundary along the natural line of the crests of the hills at toe time of demarcation, the Arabic documents at tached to the Boundary Commission's Ho. 19 of llarch 15th 1904 show that Lrtb&amp;liy the KAUSHA3I Sultan might be entitled to claim the AM A-h?A-JAETW -lATJHA line, a rectification that would be more acceptable to th® WAJIKI and SHAMKKA villagers now that the HAUSEABI Sultan ALI 1 AKA haw replaced the lately deceased Sultan '&lt;Tchadn and the latter's harsh rule hue given place to the more conciliatory methods of. his successor. 25.

Lord Lansdowne proposes, if Mr. Brodrick concurs, to approve the action taken by Sir N. 0*Conor in the matter. Aden Boundary Delimitation, upon which, how- I am Sir Your most obedient humble Servant he Under Secretary of State, India Office.spy* C ON STANTINOPLE, April 4th, 1905. | o 3. 223. My Lord:- With reference to my telegrams Nos. 56 and 58 of the 21st and 25th ultimo, I have the honour to report that on the 29th instant the Minister of War telegraphed to the Ottoman Aden Frontier Commissioners repeating his instructions to accept the insertion in the proces verbal of our claim to Dabhiani, Juban, Naawa and Huhaiyatein as being dependencies of the Canton Yaffai, and further authorizing them to recog nize the Aulaki as one of the nine cantons. On the same day however he received a tele gram from the Commissioners raising two fresh points, the first a proposal made by Mr. Fitzmaurice to substi tute in the clause relative to the non-alienation of that part of the Subaihi territory of which we recog nize the Turkish occupation the words 'territory be tween le Marquess of Lansdowne, K. G., c!x»c. , d&amp;c * , •between the two lines' lor 'territory adjoining tne line terminating at Sheiich Mirad'; and the second Mr. Pitz- raaurice's declaration that the proposal that neitner lb , party should send troops into the nine cantons was one that could not he taken into consideration. The Com missioners therefore asked for instructions as to their attitude on these two points. On the following day Mr. Lamb learnt at the office of the Grand Vizier that a letter was about to be sent to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs asking that these two points should be discussed with the Embassy and having in mind the extreme difficulty which has so constantly confronted us of making the details of this question clear to the numerous departments through which the correspondence has passed, I considered it in expedient at this stage to introduce any changes into the wording of our proposals which have been repeatedly recorded in the same words. The expression 'the terri tory between the two lines' conveys no meaning to the departments, whereas they have at last come to under standm l the Ubj P itz- Bither ’ v a8 one C Qui to their 'he office ) be sent at these sy and as so s of this rough which tin- ■es iiito pedtedl'J e terrl- m :er- understand what we mean by demanding that the 'terri tory adjoining the line terminating at Sheikh Mirad' should not be ceded to any third Power; and any attempt to change the accepted phraseology now would be sure to lead to further trouble and misunderstanding. Mr* Lamb succeeded in inducing the Grand Vizier not to refer to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs but to instruct the Minister of War to send orders to the Com missioners that 'the question of sending troops into the nine Cantons was one with which they had nothing to do since it had been disposed of between the Embassy and the Porte, while as to the non-alienation clause they were to abide by the instructions already sent'. I accordingly sent to Mr. Fitzmaurice in reply to his telegram Mo. 10 of the 27th of March, repeated by him to Your Lordship, the telegram of which a paraphrase is enclosed herewith. I have, &amp;c,, h (Signed) N. R. 0*Conor. LParaphrase of Telegram In Cypher from His Majesty's Representative at Constantinople to Mr. Fitzmaurice, Perim. No. 13. March 30th, 1905. With reference to your telegram No. 10 of the 27tli instant. I see no necessity for seeking to modify instruc tions to Ottoman Commissioner as there can be no doubt as to the territory to which the non-alienation clause refers. In view of the fact that the matter has been dropped by mutual consent, I agree with orders sent to Turkish Commissioners that they have nothing to do with question of sending troops into the nine Cantons, Although I think mention in Proces-Vorbal of fact that Aulaki is one of the nine tribes is superfluous, you can insert it if you think it advisable, as Turkish Commissioners have been told that it is reckoned in the nine Cantons.Prop er ty of His Britannic Majesty's Government,] [March 6.] Section 2.

PENDING the receipt of the instructions solicited from your Lordship in my despach No. 481 of the 16th ultimo, I thought it advisable to pave the way for the request that the new green line should be accepted by the Ottoman Government, by handing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs a map showing the course of the line in question, as well as a short description of its passage. I have the honour to inclose a copy of this document herewith. The Commissipn having recently informed me by telegraph that their Ottoman colleagues hesitated to acknowledge the Aulaki as one of the nine tribes, and also declined to recognize certain of the subsidiary tribes of the Yaffai as being under our protection, I presented to the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday a pro-memorid, copy inclosed, requesting that orders should be sent to put a stop to these continued difficulties, and I took the opportunity of recapitulating once more by name the nine tribes. The Grand Vizier, whom I subsequently visited, informed me that the Amiri frontier-line as laid down in my Memorandum was already before the Sultan, and that he hoped very shortly to be able to tell me that instructions had been sent to the Turkish Commissioners on both points as desired. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum.

THE continued refusal of the Turkish Government to settle the question of the boundaries of the nine cantons in the Hinterland of Aden renders it necessary that the Sultan and his Ministers should be left in no doubt as to the determination of His Majesty’s Government to insist on a solution in accordance with the promise made by His Imperial Majesty to the King’s Ambassador in September last. The recent stages of this controversy which have led to the present situation are well known to you and the Turkish Government, but it will be useful that I should briefly summarize them. In the summer of last year the protracted labours of the Joint Commissioners appointed by the two Governments had resulted in a satisfactory agreement in regard to the greater part of the boundary line between the nine cantons and Turkish territory. Only two portions remained unsettled, namely, the boundary of the Subaihi tribe from Mudariba southward to the sea and the line from Lakmat-es-Shub north eastward to the desert. In respect of both these portions of the line an agreement in principle has already been arrived at between the two Governments. On the 11th August last, Sir N. O’Conor presented to the Sublime Porte a Memorandum containing proposals with a view of arriving at a friendly settlement of these two outstanding difficulties. In the case of the Subaihi boundary, His Majesty’s Government were prepared to cede to the Sultan a considerable tract of territory to which that tribe had valid claims, on the sole condition that those claims should be reserved in case the territory in question should be ceded to any other Power. Their proposal for the settlement of the boundary from Lakmat-es-Shub to the desert amounted to no more than a request that the Turkish Government should adhere to the terms of the Imperial Irade of the 13th February, 1903. On the 23rd September, 1904, His Majesty’s Ambassador, who was about to proceed on leave of absence, was received in audience by the Sultan, and His Imperial Majesty then promised that he would, on the following day, give his formal assent to the Aden frontier delimitation. This promise was not carried out. Sir N. O’Conor consequently postponed his departure from Constantinople, and during the ensuing fortnight repeatedly pressed the Sublime Porte for its fulfilment 111 the usual form of an Imperial Irade. These representations met with no result, and finally, on the 9th October, his Excellency sent his First Dragoman to the 1 orte to demand a categorical answer. Mr. Lamb was then informed that the Irade tv as actually promulgated, and would reach the Porte on that day. _ On the faith of this assurance Sir N. O’Conor left Constantinople on e 10th October. - 1 , -1 j + -n On the 10th October you were informed at the Porte that the Irade had ac ua 7 been received, and that it was favourable. Mr. Lamb saw the Turkish Mims er 01 Foreign Affairs the next day. He was not shown the text of the Imperial Ira e, u was assured by Tewfik Pasha that it was perfectly satisfactory and m accordance with the terms of the Memorandum communicated by Sir N. O Conor on the 1 1 ugus . Mr. Lamb was further authorized to tell you that you could report o me 111 this sense. , T n i Two days later, on the 13th October, you learned that the Irade had een reca e [1830 g 1J 11 V © :r . s* / I M r -This Trade falls far short of a fulfilment of the promises of the Sultan and his Government. It is obviously based on misconceptions of the geographical details, and it introduces a new condition with regard to the dispatch of troops to the nine cantons to which His Majesty’s Government are entirely unable to assent. . On the 9th ultimo I instructed you by telegraph to explain to the Porte the views of His Majesty’s Government on this communication. The representations which you have made have met with no response, and I have now to request that you will point out to the Porte that after the long delays which have taken place, and the trouble and expense which has been incurred in this delimitation, His Majesty s Government cannot any longer tolerate these repeated attempts on the part of the Turkish Government to frustrate the efforts of His Majesty’s Government to obtain a reasonable and friendly settlement. You will inform the Turkish Government :— Firstly, that although the line of frontier described in the new Trade is obviously founded on a misconception of the geographical details, His Majesty’s Government take \ note of the fact that the Sublime Porte have sent instructions which will enable their I Commissioner to draw the frontier line of the Subaihi tribe from Mudariba to Sheikh ) Murad through Jebel Kuwah, leaving this fort and the village of Turba with the wells on the Turkish side of the frontier. Secondly, that with reference to the large tract of country, measuring some 550 square miles, belonging to the Subaihi tribe, which His Majesty’s Government recognize as in Turkish occupation, they take note of the declaration that the Turkish Government will not alienate any portion of the Ottoman dominions at any time or under any circumstances as a binding pledge to Great Britain in regard to this territory. Thirdly, that His Majesty’s Government consider that the districts known as Dhabiani, Juban, Maawa, and Rubeaten are dependencies of the Y r affai, one of the nine British cantons, but that they reserve a final decision upon this point for the Commission which will delimitate the frontier from Lakmat-es-Shub north-east to the desert, in virtue of the Imperial Trade of the I3th February, 1903. Fourthly, that His Majesty’s Government, will hold the Turkish Government to the pledge given in the new Trade that no Turkish troops will be sent into the nine cantons, but that His Majesty’s Government record their indisputable right to send British troops thither to such places and at such times as occasion may require in the interests of public security, as they have been in the habit of doing since 1837, when the districts in question came under British protection. ^ ' On this understanding His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to demarcate the line from Mudariba to Sheikh Murad as proposed in Sir N. O’Conor’s Memorandum of the 11th August, and now agreed to by the Turkish Government. Should the Turkish Government raise any further difficulties in regard to the above points, His Majesty’s Government will find themselves compelled to decline topursue further the negotiations which have been so unnecessarily and vexatiously prolonged. They will thereupon take their own measures for defining the line which they consider it necessary to claim, and for maintaining their rights over the territory included in it. You will read tliis despatch to the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, and supply him with a copy if he should desire it. ’ tw „ I am, &amp;c.

I represented that some of these Cantons were far removed from the Province of the Yemen, and were in immediate proximity to Aden itself, and that the Turkish Government could hardly seriously anticipate that Great Britain would relinquish such a right over territory which had been under British suzerainty since 1837. The Minister replied that he did not know / * how the clause had got inserted, but that of course no one could prevent Great Britain sending troops into the Nine Cantons if she felt so disposed. Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., ., &amp;c. , &amp;c ., II concurred, but pointed out that the matter could not be settled satisfactorily until the Porte had withdrawn a condition which was obnoxious in form, how ever inoperative it might of necessity remain in prac tice # I have &amp;c., (Signed) Walter Townley.PERSIA AND ARABIA CONFIDENTIAL. Mr. Townley to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received January 2, 1905 ) (No. 982.) My Lord, Constantinople, December 27, 1904. I REMINDED the Grand Vizier yesterday that he had told me on the 19th instant that the Aden boundary question was to he submitted the following day to a Special Council of Ministers sitting at Aildiz Palace, that their deliberations would certainly result in a new &lt;c Mazbatta, advising the Sultan to approve of the proposals made by Sir Nicholas O’Conor in August last, which had been already accepted by the Irade that made such a meteoric appearance at the Porte in the early days of October, and that the matter would be settled in a day or two. A week, I said, had now elapsed, and I could only conclude, since no Irade had appeared, that either the Council had not decided in the sense he had indicated, or that His Majesty was not willing to accept their advice. Such being the case, it only remained for me to inform your Lordship that a settlement of the question seemed as remote as ever, in spite of the assurances which bad been conveyed to you by Musurus Pasha that it would be settled immediately. The Grand Vizier assured me that the Special Council had advised the Sultan to ratify the arrangement come to with Sir N. O’Conor, and begged me to he patient for one day more. I consented, but said that I could not conceive that your Lordship would be willing to wait much longer before taking the steps, as reported by Musurus Pasha, which would have humiliating results for Turkey. Mr. Lamb ascertained at the Porte this afternoon that, after my departure yesterday, the Grand Vizier sent an urgent letter to the Palace, asking why the Trade had not been issued. To his query answer was made that the decision given by the Extraordinary Council must now he submitted to the ordinary Council, which meets to-morrow. Mr. Lamb was promised that the Irade would appear on Thursday or Friday at latest. It is now rumoured that Abdullah Pasha, late xActing Vali and Commander-in- Chief of the Yemen, is to be appointed Vali of that province. As it has been openly stated and acknowledged at the Porte that he is responsible for the delay that has occurred in the settlement of the Aden question, I deemed it advisable to instruct Mr. Lamb to warn the Minister for Foreign Affairs that such an appointment, coupled with the Porte’s repeated breach of promises and procrastination in settling the Aden Delimitation Agreement, would make the worst possible impression. Tewfik Pasha professed to be ignorant of any intention to send Abdullah Pasha back to the Yemen, but asked if such an appointment would meet with the opposition of His Majesty’s Government if the Aden question was first settled. Mr. Lamb replied that, as far as he was aware, it would not. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) WALTER TOWNLEY.Register No. 1 Minute Paper. SECRET DEPARTMENT -zfir LetteiSfrom Dated ^ Bee.

Aden Delimitation. Turkish Commissioner states that he has not yet received instructions, which apparently, notwithstanding obscrurity of the wording, would enable line to Murad to be settled. “Admission in the Turkish Ambassador’s Note ‘to delimit Subaihi border by line from Kudam ’ seems most important, and the Ottoman Government might be held to it with a view to compel the withdrawal of the objectionable would-be restriction against British troops visiting the Nine Cantons, which include Dthala and even Aden, according to Turkish interpretation; also to secure specific reversion territory up to Akama and Akkar and Kudam, as proposed in the Government of India’s telegram, 14th July last year, to Secretary of State for India, instead of the vague promise against cession of territory, coupled with condition of territory outside line to Murad ‘ remaining in Yemen Vilayet.’ “ I would accordingly, subject to approval, propose to Turkish Commis sioner line of the watershed from Numan to Nojan; then to Uzzan paragraph 9 of Memorandum enclosed in Commission’s No. 41, 4th June last year), thence by Kudam, TTmari, Kuwah and Murad, thus leaving to the Turks the strip of littoral with village of Dabab, the telegraph, road, and their necessary wells, as shown on the half-inch survey. “ Embassy telegram No. 48, 5th November last, to me, apparently con tained Sultan’s decision concerning north-east delimitation, and, for reason given in my telegram No. 38, 6th November, it should not be left, perhaps, ( without a reply.”———India Office, London, 7th April 1905, Secret, No. 10. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor- General of India in Council. Mr Lord, I have considered the Secret Letter of your Excellency’s review of the results then accomplished, the Resident’s report on the proceedings of the Aden Delimitation Commission, and submitting to the notice of His Majesty’s Government the services performed by the officers concerned in the demarcation. 2. Since the date of your letter an agreement has been arrived at with the Porte which should lead to an early iemaroatterrof the remaining section of the line from Sheikh Murad to Mudariba in respect to which unexpected delays have arisen owing to the attitude of the Turkish Government. The work of delimitatioa from the sea to the Wadi Bana will then be completed, and a definite frontier laid down between the Turkish dominions and the territories of the Subaihi, Haushahi, and Amiri tribes under our protection. 3. His Majesty’s Government, while appreciating the difficult and complicated nature of the work entrusted to the Resident and the Commissioners, regret that it has been prolonged by the causes mentioned in your Despatch under reply. They concur in the view expressed by your Excellency of the services rendered by General Maitland and by Colonel Wahab, Mr. EitzMaurice, and the officers employed in the work of the delimitation. , .Aden Delimitation Commission : services of the officers.

Sir:- I am directed hy the Marquess of Lansdowne to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, inclosing the report hy General Maitland on the work of the Aden Delimitation Commission, to gether with a covering despatch from the Government of India. With reference to Mr. Secretary Brodrick's ob servations respecting the services of the Officers r \. ■ 1 ■ employed in the Delimitation I am to say that, in Lord Lansdowne’s opinion, any approval hy His Ma jesty's Government of the conduct of these Officers should he expressed in very measured terms. It is true that the task entrusted to them was difficult and complicated, and, inasmuch as that task has actually been accomplished, the Members of the Commission are entitled to the thanks of His Majesty's Government. Lord e Under Secretary of State, India Office11 II—III f Lord Lansdowne considers however that the time taken to complete the work of delimitation was un duly prolonged; that the delays were not by any means entirely due to Turkish obstruction or the inherent difficulties of the task and that the lack of har mony and frank cooperation between the Resident and the Commission which manifested itself on frequent occasions was most unfortunate. It would be invidious now to go into these mat- ters, or to endeavour to apportion responsibility for these shortcomings but Lord Lansdowne does not think that the case is one in which upon the whole any warm commendation on the part of His Majesty's Gov ernment is deserved by those concerned.
