General Arab history from the very earliest times snows us a race, largely nomads, split up into numerous tribes, ever warring with each other, and without any sense of nationality. Such the Arab is to-day. Independent, and restive under personal authority, he is yet the slave of immemorial tribal custom- To him his tribe is everything: its interests overrule all other instincts and emotions: its customs are the only ones he can conceive to be endurable; a nd in ancient times, his own particular tribal god was the only one worthy for a man to wor ship. To this constant hostility between tribe and tribe must be added the loathing and contempt with which the nomads regard the settled agriculturists, and the hatred of the latter for the nomads, to whom they are superior in numbers, wealth, and education. No combination between these tribes has ever been of long duration. At times one tribe or another has gained ascend ancy over its neighbours, but the authority so won has been precarious, short lived, and, in the more outlying regions, pure ly nominal. And so it has been with other nations that have conquered portions of Arabia. The Assyrians, Persians, Chaldeans, and C387GSB bin later times, Egypt and Abyssinia, all had their turn, though none held any but a nominal authority for very long. The nature of the Arab tends towards disintegration. Even the complete and lasting triumph of Islam over the multitude of tribal gods, and the unity of purpose which forced the Mu- hammadan faith upon surrounding nations were more appa rent than real. For the Arab, at least the Bedouin Arab, is not and never has been fanatical on religious matters. In ancient times his god was the symbol of his tribe as opposed to all other tribes, and it was as such that it held his esteem ; while in these days, although he carries out the ritual of reli gion, he is not excessively concerned about its tenets and dog mas. For long the minds of men had been prepared for change. First the proselytizing Jewish trader, who had spread through out the country, undermined men's faith in their tribal gods, while vague notions of Christianity accentuated the feeling of doubt and encouraged enquiry. Some Bedouin tribes had been entirely converted to the Jewish faith. Then came Mu hammad who, after hovering between the Jewish and Chris tian religions, finally evolved one of his own: a simple reli gion suited to a simple people. And although he raised Al lah, one of the many Arabian deities, to the position of the one and only god, he retained the sacred stone of his own town, as the symbol of the deity. It is still to this stone that the Arab makes his pilgrimage, even as his pagan forefathers did in ' the age of darkness'. The new religion spread, partly as a result of the ruthless wars of extermination that Muhammad carried on against those who opposed him, and partly because of the rich spoils that fell to the tribes that consented to fight under his banner. And as admission to the ranks of the conquerors could be gain ed by the mere repetition of a simple formula, the tempta tion to join and share in the plunder was irresistible, especi ally for a people whose habitual occupation was raiding their richer neighbours. But there were constant jealousies and feuds between the various tribes, which even the prospect of looting a common enemy could not suppress. And even to-day each tribe hates its neighbour at least as heartily as it hates nations of another faith.Another impulse driving the tribes to temporary combi nation in foreign wars was the increasing poverty of the country. The trade between India and Persia on the one hand, and Europe and Egypt on the other, which in ancient times had crossed Arabia by caravans, was gradually being trans ported more and more by sea, thus depriving the people of one main source of their wealth. • The geological formation of the continent of Arabia also suggests that another influence was at work, more slow in its action but far more relentless. The centre of Arabia is be lieved to be composed of a vast sandstone plateau whoso sur face is constantly disintegrating under the effects of air and change of temperature. It is thus continuously forming loose sand which, spread by the winds, is gradually covering the Cultivable land, killing off the vegetation and drying up the country. In many places the signs of this process are evident, for rivers flow beneath the ground, rich soir is often found buried deep beneath the sand, and deserted ruins in the de sert suggest that they were once surrounded by considerable areas of fertile and cultivated land. This process carried on for centuries must have involved the obliteration of oases and large tracts of grazing land, leaving in its place nothing but unprofitable desert. So it is probable that what appeared to be a great religious movement was in reality nothing but the symptom of a power ful economic cause. The country could not support its popu lation and emigration was the inevitable result. The lesson which history thus teaches us is that, by taking advantage of the jealousies between the tribes, we might well succeed in conquering the country; but we should find it very difficult to hold. At the best our condition would be one of unstable equilibrium; while in time of trouble temporary coalitions would certainly be made to drive us out. The only events connecting the protectorate with the cut- side world that offer points of any practical interest may be given in a few words, The Abyssinians make vague pretentions to an interest in the country, but their connection with it is ancient history and only lasted for three quarters of a century. In 629 A. D. the king of Abyssinia sent an army of 70,000 men to Aden, b24 conquered the country and ruled It until driven out by the Arab^, assisted by Persians, in 605 A. D. Far more important are the Turkish dealings with the coun try. In 1538 the Turks captured Aden as a base fof their oper ations against the Portuguese; and, except for a short inter val when it was taken by the latter, they remained in posses sion of it till they evacuated the Yemen in 1630. From that time onwards the political status of Western, Southern, and parts of Central Arabia varied from complete independence to a more or less nominal subordination to the Ottoman dynasty^ until, in 1871 a Turkish army from Syria finally conquered the Yemen. Since then Central and Southern Arabia have been entirely independent while the western provinces, though frequently in revolt, have never succeeded in throwing off the Turkish yoke. These events explain the attitude of Turkey in their deal^ ings with the British protectorate; for although officially re cognising our present position, they cannot help regarding it as a blow to Turkish prestige. The British connection with the protectorate commenced in 1609 when the Honourable East India Company's ship Ascension visited Aden. The captain was made a prisoner by the Governor, who seized goods to the value of 2,500 dol- la is. On the 3rd May 1799 Perim, not being claimed by any other power, was formally taken possession of by the East India Company, but was evacuated in September owing to want of water. The troops were first withdrawn to Aden, where? the Sultan offered them an asylum, until the following March, when they returned to Bombay* British interest in the Red Sea and Arabian Ports had al ready manifested itself for some 200 years, when, towards the beginning of the 19th century, the need for the more effi cient protection of shipping, and of a coaling depot and port of call, made itself more acutely felt. Aden was at this time in the possession of the 2 Abdali Sultan: its former commercial importance had greatly declined, and its population numbered less than a thousand. In 1829, some coal was landed on Sira Island, Aden, for the use of the Hugh Lindsay, the firstd steamer built in India, but as labotir was nnobtainable, was adopted as a coaling station instead. In January 1837 the ship Deria Doulat, bailing under British colours, went on shore a few miles from Aden, Was plundered, and the pas sengers subjected to brutalities by Arabs. In order to pre vent the recurrence of similar outrages, Captain Haines I. N^, with a detachment of the Bombay European Regiment was despatched by the Bombay Government, to obtain repa ration, and to endeavour to secure the place by purchase. A portion of the indemnity required Was obtained^ and a bond granted by the Sultan to the effect that he Wottld cede the place to the British, in March 1839, against an annual pen sion of 8,700 dollars. The treachery of the Ar&amp;bs, however, tendered further negotiations abortive aiwj# iu consequence of this and further evidence of bad faith, an expedition was despatched from Bombay to take possession of Aden. It arrived in Aden Back Bay on the 16th January 1839, and con- Sifted of H. M. S. Votage (28 guns) and H. M. S. Gruizer (10 guns), with 400 men of the Bombay European Regiment, the 24th Bombay Native Infantry (now the 124th Baluchis), the 4th Company, 1st Battalion Artillery, and the 6th Com pany Artillery. The Arab garrison was composed of 750 sol diers from the interior. On the 19th the attack was carried out from the East, and Aden was captured with a loss to ourselves of only sixteen killed and wounded. The SultUn fled to Lahej* From the very first, it became evident that the occupatidnf &gt; of Aden itself would be of little use unless a good understanding were arrived at with the neighbouring tribes, as in their hands lay the power of interfering with the land-borne trade, and the ! Supplies on which the town was, in those early days, so largely dependent. Before the end of January, treaties of peace and friend ship were concluded with the Azzaibi, a bfanch of the 'Abdali, who maintained consistent friendship with the British; and during the next month, similar agreements were entered into with the 'Akrabi, Subaihi, Fadhli, Yafa'i, Amiri, and Shar- jabi (the last-named, a tribe now well Within the Turkish border.) The population soon began to increase, and; Mttle more than a year after the first capture, it had risen to 4,600. The first years show a turbulent record with a good deal of fighting, though a^ regards the British, not of a very deadly6 kind. The 'Abiali Chief had been paid a sum of 541 dollars, the first instalment of the purchase stipend originally agreed Cm, but on the 11th November 1839 ? he made his first attempt to retake Aden, in conjunction with the Chief of the Padhli. The attack was m^de on the Isthmus position at 4 o'clock in the morning in three columns of 2,000 men each, but was met by fire from the trenches while the Company's brig Fuphra- Us enfiladed the columns. The enemy was routed with a loss of 200 killed and wounded, while the British had no casual ties. The 'Abdali's stipend was stopped and the Fadhli coast and the port of Shuqra blockaded. Three more unsuccessful attempts to retake Aden were 1 made by the Arabs, the last being in 1846, at which time the garrison of the fortress consisted of 1,200 European and 1,300 Indian troops. Since then, when military operations have been necessary we have always taken the offensive and invaded the territory of the offending tribe. As the rest of our dealings with the Arabs have almost invariablv been with individual tribes they will be dealt with in the historical accounts of the tribes concerned. First, how ever, it is desirable to give a short description of our relations with our most powerful neighbour, Turkey. The year 1873 is an important one in the history of the protectorate, as Turkish aggression from the north then first made itself distinctly felt, and its consequences led up to the re cent formation of an international commission to define the respective spheres of influence of the British and Ottoman Em pires. The Turks, absent for many years from Yemen, found their opportunity in the confusion which prevailed after the evacuation of Yemen by the Egyptians in 1840. In 1849 a Turkish expedition from Jedda captured the port of Hodeida and obtained possession of the Tihama, or low-lying coast belt, the same year. The Turks continued the extension of their conquests inland from the coast in succeeding years, till in 1873 they had reached the limits of the tribes under British influ ence. The Haushabi Sultan, aggrieved at his reverses at the hands of the 'Abdali, and in temporary disgrace with the Bri tish authorities, intrigued with the Turkish Governor at Ta'- izz, and was successful in inducing a Turkish force to advance to the frontiers of Lahej. Representations were at once made to the Porte, and the immediate withdrawal of the Turkish troops was promised. Thepromise was, however, not carried out, and at the instigation of an intriguing brother of the 'Abdall Sultan, a Turkish' force actually occupied his fortified house at Al-Hauta, the capital of the Lahej country. The Resident, on this, with a force of artillery, infantry, and cavalry, occupied the Lahej district but the Turks did not withdraw till December of the same year.' A Turkish force also marched through the 'Alawl countrv' and compelled the head Shaikh who had refused his allegiance to the Turkish authorities at Ta'izz to surrender his son as a hostage. The Ltter was eventually released on the renre- sentations of the British Government. In this year also occurred the Turkish occupation of Dhala which practically continued in a greater or bss * degree till the evacuation of Jalila in 1903. A despatch from Lord Gran ville, detailing the 'nine tribes', informed the Porte that Her Majesty s Government could not view with indifference anv Turkish interference with them. It was followed in 1874 by a further despatch from Lord Derby, strongly deprecating any interference by Turkish officials with stipendiary chiefs The Porte replied that the Governor-General of Yemen had been instructed to prevent any such interference. ^Turkish encroachment, although subsequently making it self felt to some extent all along the boundary, has alwavs been particularly active in the Amiri country. In the year 1900 trouble occurred on the northern Haush- abi boundary between the Turkish tribe of Humar and the Haushabi. The representative of Turkish authoritv in tho,« regions at that time was an Arab of Humar origin W J™! Muhammad Nasir Muqbil, an astute, but intriguing and gerous man. As well as possessing very considerable influ- t !! e u 1 : urks ' | e liad come to ^ understanding with the Abdah Sultan and in the early part of 1900 he erectpd a tower at Kafuf about two miles to the north -west of the vil lage of Ad-Dareja, and well within Haushabi limits from which he and his Humars were able to cause considerable annoyance to the Haushabi. Representation to the Turkish authorities produced promises of evacuation but no action Fighting ensued, but the Haushabi were unable to turn out the Humar unaided, and in July 1901 n. 'RWHcTh ^ sisting of 200 of the West Kent Regiment, 200 of the SthBom'. bay Light Infantry, a camel battery of 7-pounder guns, sappers8 •and part of the Aden troop, were despatched under Major Kowe of the West Kent Regiment to eject them. In the mean time Muhammad Nasir, by misrepresenting to the Turkish authorities at Ta'izz that the British force was intended to commit a wanton aggression on Turkish territory, induced them to despatch a force of 400 men, who proceeded to Kafuf and -occupied the tower. On the arrival of the British force, the heights near the village otAd-Dareja were found to be occu pied by the Humar. They were attacked and put to flight and the attack was then directed on the tower which was mainly defended by the Turks. When night fell, the Turks were still in possession of the tower, but they evacuated it during the night, leaving 5dead on the ground and 8 prisoners. Their total casualties were estimated at 40. The British force lost four killed and 5 wounded. As a consequence of this contretemps, the Porte, which ihad previously rejected offers of demarcation of the frontier, itself proposed it. The offer was accepted, and in January 1902 the British Commissioners proceeded to Dhala, the por tion of the boundary which seemed to promise the most dif ficulty. The first meeting with the Turkish Commissioners took place soon after. During 1902 negotiations with the 'Turkish Commissioners proceeded but slowly, owing to Tur kish obstruction, and at the beginning of 1903 matters were little more advanced than they had been a year before. The escort of the British Commissioii had originally been a double ■company of Indian Infantry, but owing to the demeanour of the Turks who were still occupying Jalila, a village in Amiri territory within 3 miles of the town of Dhala, it was found necessary to exert pressure; and in January 1903, a column was despatched to Dhala consisting of some 300 British and 200 Indian soldiers. This was still further strengthened, in the ensuing month, till in March there was present a force of 700 British infantry, 860 Indian Infantry, the Abbottabad Mountain Battery and a section of camel 7-prs. with details from No. 45 Company, Royal Garrison Artillery, making a total of 2,200 fighting men. No. 6 British Mountain Battery arrived soon after, and 2 cruisers from the Mediterranean Squadron were despatched to Aden to hold themselves in readi ness; A force of 400 British and Native Infantry arid 4 guns (two 9-pr. field guns and 2 7-pr. camel guns) occupied Dar Akkan, a post commanding the Tiban valley route.9 Towards the end of March the Turks received orders from the Porte to evacuate Jalila and to retire to Ka'taba ; the British Commission followed them to Sana, an Amir! village some 2 miles from Ka'taba, and in these places they remained till the 16th December when, an agreement as regards the Amiri boundary having been reached, the Bri tish Commission marched by the Tiban route into the Hau- shabi country, the majority of the British garrison at Dhala being withdrawn to Musaimir. In February 1904 the Commission entered the Subaihi country and on the 23rd May* reached the coast at Ras-ui Ara, having completed the field work. Tkibal History, (References are to Aitchison's Treaties, Engagements and Sanr.ds 19090 \ibdalu Since the beginning of the last century, when the declin- ing power oi the Imams of Sana enabled the'Abdali chief, in concert with his neighbour the Yafa'i Sultan, to seize the stronghold of Aden and to proclaim his own independence;, we do not read of a single attempt on the part of the tribe to increase the extent of their territories, or to put in execution the schemes of aggression, which they doubtless secretly nour ished. In 1728 Fadhl-bin-'Ali, who had been appointed Gover nor of Lcyhej by the fmam of San a, declared his independenoe and allied himself with the Yafai, Fadhli, Haushab-, and other neighbouring tribes by paying them tribute. By these means he was able to repulse the forces sent against him by the Imam. In 1742 he was treacherously murdered, at the instigation of the Imam, by the Yaf a'i, who at the same time seized Aden. Although his son succeeded in retaking it, Aden, during the succeeding years was frequently attacked by neighbour ing tribes and even Al-Hauta, the capital, was more than once in danger. But, sometimes by the assistance of the Hushabi, at other times by buying off their enemies, the Sultans of Lahej succeeded in maintaining their independence. In 1799 Ahmad, grandson of Fadhl-bin-'Ali, offefed an asylum to the troops under Colonel Murray upon the evacua tion of Perim; and in 1802 entered into a commercial and poli tical treaty (No. XV) with the British Government. Durina C387GSB b c10 his reign the 'Abdali were at various times at war with the Yafa'i, the Wahabis, and the Upper 'Aulaki. Sultan Ahmad disd in 1827 and was succeeded by his nephew, Muhsin-bin-Eadhl, from whom we captured Aden on the 19th January 1839 in circumstances that have already been recorded. Various engagements were entered into with this tribe during the years that followed, but all were broken; and in 1857 'Ali -bin-Muhsin entered upon a course of open hostility which resulted in his complete defeat at Shaikh Othman in March 1858 by a force composed of 2 or 3 companies of the 57th Regi ment, a wing of the 29th Bombay* Infantry and a detachment from the Elfhinstone. In 1873 a force of Britisn and Indian intantry with three guns marched to Al-Hauta to protect the Sultan against the aggression of the Turks who had invaded his territory. After some negotiations the Turkish troops were withdrawn. In 1882 the Sultan's stipend was increased to 19,682 dollars (Treaty No. XXIV) and we obtained by purchase 35 miles of territory attached to Shaikh Othman, between the Hiswa and 'Imad ! together with the salt pits and the aqueduct. In succeeding years the 'Abdali had frequent troubles with the 'Akrabi and the Subaihi, and an arrangement made in 1881, by which the latter tribe had been placed under the control of the 'Abdali, fell into abeyance. But, though de sultory fighting has constantly occurred, the 'Abdali have under taken no operations on a large scale for many years. The relation of the late Sultan, Ahmad Fadhl, with the British Government were uniformly friendly. He came to the throne in 1898, and died early in 1914, being succeeded by his nephew, 'Ali bin Ahmad bin 'Ali. 'Akrabi. The 'Akrabi were originally a sub-division of the 'Abdali. Of their early history nothing is known; but about the year 1770, under the leadership of their Shaikh, they threw off their allegiance to the Sultan of Lahej. The ruined fort of Bir Ah mad which fell into their hands was restored and, assisted by the Fadhli, they resisted the attacks of the 'Abdali. Since then they have retained their independence and have a reputa tion for high courage. _ For the first year after our capture of Aden the Akrabi maintained friendly relations with us; but under the influence11 of the Fadhli chief their policy was reversed and they remained consistently hostile until 1857 wheu the chief renewed his pro fessions of good will. In 1863 an agreement was made with him (No. XL) by which in return for an immediate payment of 3,000 dollars and a monthly stipend of 30 dollars he undertook not to sell, mort gage, or give for occupation any part of the peninsula of Little Aden save to the British Government. In April 1889 by another agreement (No. XLI) we acquired the peninsula for 30 ? 000 dollars, the stipend of the chief being raised at the same time to 40 dollars a month. For^ many years there was constant animosity between the 'Akrabi and their less warlike but intriguing neighbours the 'Abdali, who gradually deprived them of all revenue from transit dues, and more than once caused much distress by cutting off the stream of the Wadi-ul-kabir before it reached Bir Ahmad, besides instigating the Subaihi and Ahl-us-Saila to commit mis chief. These troubles culminated in 1887: various other tribes were drawn into the quarrel; and finally the 'Abdali besieged Bir Ahmad in a desultory fashion. Finally, as plundering began to extend to the British limits at Hiswa, the Resident intervened and peace was restored. In July 1888 an agreement (No. XLII) was concluded with the 'Akrab! Shaikh by which a strip of foreshore was purchased for Rs 2,000, to connect the British limits at Al-Hiswa and Bandar Fuqum; and at the same time, by a separate treaty (No, LIII), a protectorate was established over the 'Akrabi. For some years the 'Akrabi had intermittent trouble with the 'Abdali and Subaihi; but since 1907 the old standing feud with the 'Abdali has ceased to exist and the present Shaikh, Fadhl ba'Abdulla, is under the influence of the Sultan of Lahej. 'Alawu The 'Alawi are said to have come originally from Lower Yafa. In former times the district was ruled by a governor on behalf of the Imam of San'a, but subordinate to the governor of the Haushabi country. When the power of the Imam dec lined the governing Shaikh declared himself independent. In^ 1873 a body of Turkish troops marched through tha ? Alawi country and compelled the Chief, Shaikh Saif-bin-Saif, g212 who had refused to render allegiance to the Turks at to make his submission and to surrender his son as a hostage. The latter was eventually released in consequence of re monstrances made by the British Ambassador at Constanti nople. Amirl, The district was originally ruled by Saiyids subject to the Imam of San'a; but when his power was broken up the descen- dants of certain Muwallads, or half-castes, who had been his slaves, succeeded in evicting the Saiyids and established them selves as independent rulers. Such, at least, is the popular version of the origin of the Amirs of Dhala and the events are supposed to have occurred about 1550 A. D. By alliances or conquest their territory has been extended to cover Kharafa, Jabal Harir, the valley of the Suhaibiya as far south as Al-kafla, the hill of Adh-Dhubayyat, Sufyan and Zobaid. Friendly relations were established with the reigning Amir soon after the British occupation of Aden, when he was granted an annual stipend of fifty dollars. This was confirmed by an agreement (No. LXVII) in October 1880 when the Amir agreed to keep the roads open and to be answerable for out rages committed by tribes subject to him. In 1873 'Ali-bin-Muqbil, who had been recognised as Amir by the British Government, was required by the Turks to make his submission to the Porte and to send a hostage to Ta'izz. A Turkish superintendent was sent to Dhala, a detachment of Turkish troops quartered there, and finally the Amir was imprisoned at Ka'taba. In January 1874 'Ali-bin-Muqbil was released, but only to find his throne occupied by a rival whose pretentions were supported by the Turks. It was not till March 1878, when the Turks ceased to countenance his rival, that he was again able to establish his authority, with the loss, however, of several villages that had yielded allegiance to the Porte. In 1881 the Kotaibi commenced exacting dues on the Har- daba route, and in July 1884 it was found necessary to support the Amir. Fifty sabres of the Aden Troop with some sappers were despatched, a few forts were destroyed, and the Kotaibi quickly tendered their submission. Meanwhile; Turkish encroachment and intrigue continued with little interuption, and the Porte resisted or eluded all13 efforts made by the Foreign Office to bring about an amicable settlement by a delimitation of the frontier. In January 1885 a Turkish force with a gun encamped between ? A1-Jalila and A1 Wa'ra and forcibly levied tribute from the Ahl Haj Sa'id and from the villages of Al-Wa'ra, DM Haran, Ar-Bubat, Surafi, Kaukaba, and 01 Sumaid. The Turkish autho rities also put pressure upon the Shairl Shaikhs to seduce them from their allegiance to the Amir, and they sent an armed force up to Jabal Jahaf. In November 1885 the Resident with 50 sabres of the Aden Troop visited Dhala, but this did not check Turkish activity. In the summer of 1886 the Turks again established themselves near Al-Jalila and now proceeded to build a fortified post and instal a regular garrison. They sent an expedition into the country of the Mafari and Humaidi south of Jabal Jahaf, but the tribesmen strenuously resisted and the Turks withdrew and contented themselves with intriguing, forming in each tribe a faction which favoured submission to Turkish rule. On the 10th September 1886 the Amir J Ali-bin Muqbil died, and his nephew, Shaif-bin-Saif, was elected to succeed him, but was not recognised by the Kotaibi, who resumed their indepen dence. The Turks from their base at Al-Jalila continued to exact tribute from the Amir's subjects of the Ash-Sh^raf villages, of Hazzat-ul-Abid, and of the Wadi Safiya, and from the Shairi tribe; also, through their adherent, the Zendam chief, from the people of Jabal Jahaf. In November 1888 in consequence of the irregular levying of dues on the caravan route by the various Chiefs, the Resident summoned a meeting at Al-Min jabah in the 'Alawi country, when the Amir among others subscribed to a schedule of rates to be levied in future and the Kotaibi formally recognised the Amir as their superior. On the Dhala plain affairs seem to have remained unalter ed until Turkish rule in Yemen was shaken by the rebellion of the Imam in 1891-92. The Turks, driven out of the A1 Aud country, fell back on Ka'taba. They were followed up by the insurgents, and took refuge in Dhi Haran, Dhala and other places in the Amir's territory. The Amir collecting several thousand of his followers, took up a position at Sanah, and occupied the line of the W^di Ka'taba to withstand the further advance of the Zaidi insurgents.14 The latter meanwhile took Ka'taba, looting the treasury and the town but leaving the Arabs' property untouched. They then found themselves checked by the Amtr. He refused their demand for the surrender of the Turks on the ground that they had cast themselves on his protection. After about a month large reinforcements reached the Turks, and the refu gees returned to their original posts in Ka'taba and the neigh bourhood. In return for these services the Turks appear ^to have restored to the Amir many of his rights which they had usurped. A Turkish regular garrison of 40 or 50 men was main tained at Jalfla, and the place, together with the neighbour ing Shairi villages of Lakmat-ul-Hajfar Jalas and Al-Waba', remained in the possession of Turks, but from this time forward the Amir had free access to his northern villages, to those of the Wadi-us-Safiya, Ahl Haj Sa'id, and Ash-Sharaf districts, and he drew revenue without hindrance from them and from the greater part of the Shairi tribe, as well as from the Mafari, H maidi Ahmadi, etc. In 1892-93 Captain AVahab was employed in surveying the Aden hinterland, and in the course of the operations he visited Dhala. Turkish influence was then so established and their occupation so far a recognised fact that, besides Al- Jalila and the surrounding Shairi villages, the villages of the Wad! Safiya, of Ash-Sharaf, and those west of Dhala at the foot of Jabal Jahaf, were pointed out to him as Turkish villages. Jabal Jahaf, and the country of the Mafari, the Azraki and the Mihrabl had come to be described in the Aden Residency records as Turkish, and, as no suggestion to the contrary appears to have been made at this time, the error was carried on in the survey maps then made. With the year 1900 began the series of events, alread y described above in our dealings with, the Turks, which resulted in the delimitation of the frontier, an operation which lasted from January 1902 to December 1904. The casualties among our troops during these two years were:— Losses in action— Killed .. -. ,, ., .. 16 Wounded .. .. ., .. 39 Invalided— Officers .. .. .. .. .. 26 British Troops .. .. .. ..100 Ihdian15 The latter figures are, however, not representative; for two British regiments were sent Home, while one British and one Indian Mountain battery returned to India. The number of men invahded was therefore probably much less than would have been the case had these units remained in the country. In November 1904 a protectorate treaty ( jSTo . LXVIII) was concluded with the Amir: his stipend, which had been raised to one hundred dollars in 1881, was confirmed, and he undertook never to cede any territory to a foreign power. 'Audafit The Audaii are supposed, to liave been concerned, in an attack made on a British survey party in 1903. No treaty has ever been made with the Sultan, in spite of several overtures on his part. Upper 'Aulakl. In former times the Shaikh of the Upper Aulaki was the WakTl of the Imam of San'a but he established his indenendence over a century ago. For many years the Upper 'Aulaki had a standing griev ance against 'the people of Yemen', i. e., the 'Abdalis and JFadhlis, on the subject of ' ousto-mary rights'. So long as the 'Aulakis had the power, they were able to extort a species of stipend^ from their weaker neighbours; but with the growth of the 'Abdali and Fadhli power they have had to be content with such gifts as the latter give them. Whenever the gifts fall below their expectations the 'Aulakis bring up the old claims of 'customary rights'. At last in 1889 the upper 'Aulaki Shaikh voluntarily gave a written agreement to abandon his claims. They also have a grievance against the Lower 'Aulaki from whom they claim a part of Maqatin. During the protracted struggle between the neighbouring States of Shehr and Mukalla the 'Aulakis threw in their lot with the Naqib of Mukalla, and often lent a force of men to assist him. From 1884 to 1886 there were frequent collisions with the Ahl-Khalifa, an independent neighbouring tribe. During 1888 the Upper 'Aulaki Sultan and Shaikh made a combined attack on Dathina. This province is almost16 independent, its Shaikh having for many years evaded payment of the tribute of 5 dollars per 'dhimd' of cultivated land due to the Sultan. In 1894-1895 the Upper 'Aulaki Shaikh assisted Muhsin- bin- 5 Ali ? the Wahldi, against his tribesmen. In December 1903 a protectorate treaty (No. XLIV) was concluded with the Upper 'Aulaki Shaikh by which he agreed to enter into no relations with any foreign power. In return he was granted a monthly stipend of sixty dollars. In March 1904 a similar treaty (No. XLV) was concluded with the Upper 'Aulaki Sultan, whose monthly stipend w^s fixed at one hundred dollars. There was some desultory fighting in 1907 betmeen the Upper 'Aulakis and some of the Dathina tribes. Lower \Aulakl. In 1855 a treaty (No. XLVI) was made with the chiefs of the Lower 'Aulaki by which they agreed to prohibit the importation of slaves from Africa. An engagement was entered into by the Sultan in 1871 to use his best endeavours to prevent outrages on shipping and to protect shipwrecked mariners. In 1883 dissensions with the ITadhli tribe occurred, which the Lower 'AulakT were defeated witb he^vy loss (see ITadhli, below). In 1888 the Sultan was granted an annual stipend of 360 dollais , and in June of the same year a protectorate treaty (No. XLVII) was concluded. The Sultan at the same time voluntarily signed an agreement abandoning his 'customary rights' over the Yemen. (See Upper 'Aulaki.) In 1893 a dispute occurred with the Upper 'Aulaki over somo land near Marir, and the latter tribe were excluded from Lower 'Aulaki territory. The ill-feeling between the two sections broke out agaih in 1901, when several skirmishes took place. On ^ more than one occasion the Sultan has complained of Sun fishermen fishing in his territorial waters. But the Surls, who are subjects of the Sultan of Musqat, claim the right of immemorial custom. The old feud with the Fadhli broke out again in 1904 owing to the latter firing on a Lower UulakI dhow; but theren\ 17 was little figliting and, towards the close of the year, a truce was proclaimed. No intercourse was held with the tribe until the demar cation of the frontier in 1903 when a protectorate treaty (No, XLVIII) was concluded with the Sharif. Fadhll. It does not appear that this tribe was ever subject to the Imam of San'a, while on the other hand it exacted money from the Sultan of Lahej for keeping the trade routes open. For nearly 30 years after our occupation the Fadhli tribe was consistently hostile to us and although various treaties or engagements were entered into, none were kept. In 1865 they plundered a caravan within gunshot of the Aden fortifications. A small body of troops was despatched against them in December, defeated them in an engagement, entered their territory and destroyed several villages. But, this punishment proving insufficient, a second expedition was sent from Aden by sea in March 1866, which destroyed the inland forts of Shuqra. As a result, a treaty (No. XXXIV)Vas concluded, in May 1867 by which the Sultan agreed to keep the roads open, and left, a near relation in Aden as a hostage. Shortly after, the Sultan was granted a stipend of a hundred dollars a month, and on his death in 1870 the hostage ceased to be kept. In 1872 transit duties on goods conveyed to and from Aden were abolished in Fadhli territory (Treaty XXXV) and the Sultan's stipend increased. A long outstanding boundary dispute with the 'Abdali was settled in 1881 (Treaty XXXVI). In 1883 the Lower 'Aulaki invaded Fadhli territory but were repulsed. In 1888 territorial disputes arose with the Lower Yafa'T, who cut off the water supply of the Nazi'a. This resulted in desultory strife broken by occasional short truces. A protectorate treaty (No. XXXVII) was concluded with the Fadhli in August 1888. More fighting with the Lower Yafa'i occurred in 1892 and the following year over the water supply of the Nazi'a. C387GSB d % %18 In 1894 the Markashis gave trouble, plundering in British territory. Finally the Sultan declared himself responsible for them. Hostilities with the Lower Yafa'I continued intermittent ly until 1906, a further cause of dispute being the establish ment by the Fadhli of a customs post at Zanzibar and the levying of duties on caravans. Ilaushabl. An ancestor of the present Sultan of the Haushabi governed the district on behalf of the Imam of San'a. Failing to pay tribute he was attacked, but succeeded in making himself in dependent. In June 1839 the British Government entered into a friend ly engagement (No. LXII) with the Sultan, who was granted an annual stipend. In 1868 the Haushabi cut off the stream that irrigates the Lahej territory and destroyed the crops of the 'Abdali. Fighting ensued and the Haushabi, who were defeated, were compelled to cede the town of Zaida and its lands. In order to regain the lost territory the Haushabi Sultan in 1873 obtained Turkish support and for a time he held part o-f Zaida, but, on the Turkish troops being withdrawn, he was compelled to retire. The dispute was finally adjusted in 1881 by an agreement (No. XXII) whereby a portion of the Zaida lands were restored to the Haushabi. Five years later this arrangement was modified by the Haushabi Chief selling his iands at Zaida to the 'Abdali for 5,000 dollars. Frequent raids on caravans and vexatious dues levied on passing trade had been a constant occurrence for many years, and in November 1888 a meeting of the chiefs concerned was effected and a schedule of rates agreed upon (see Appendix HI Treaties, Engagements, and Sanads, 1909), but was not adhered to. In 1890-91 skirmishes took place with the Subaihis, but, by the intercession of the Amir of Dhala, peace was conclud ed between the Haushabi and the 'Abdali. This was broken in 1894 when, owing to the heavy taxes levied on caravans, the 'Abdali entered the Haushabi country and the Sultan19 being repudiated by his chiefs., was deposed. He was reinst ated in the following year under certain guarantees (No. LXTV ) and a protectorate treaty (No. LXV) was concluded with him* In 1900 Mnhammad-bin-Nasir Muqbil, a Shaikh of the Humar tribe, and a Turkish Mudir, built a fort in Haushs bi limits which the Turks garrisoned. The Turkish authorities were requested to vacate it. This they failed to do, and the Haushabi Sultan was given permission to drive them out. The attempt failed, and in July 1901 a force of 500 men was des patched from Aden. The Turks and Muhammad-bin-Nasir Muqbil's adherents were driven from their position at Ad- Dareja on the 26th July and the expeditipn returned to Aden. Throughout 1906 the Haushabi were constantly harassed by the Subaihi; while the Dhambaris, who are practically an independent clan of the Radfan range, made frequent raids north of Nubat Dakinu Kaaifl. Until some 400 years ago the whole of Ka'aiti territory was in possession of the Kathiri; but, disputes having arisen among the members of the ruling family towards the close of the fifteenth cehtury, one of the claimants called in the Yafa'T, who, in return for putting him in power, retained for themselves the ports of Shehr and Mukalla. They appear also to have obtained further territory from which they were ejected by the Kathiri before the middle of the 19th century. Nothing more appears on record till April 1850, when the Turks sent an agent to Mukalla and Shohr to place those ports under Turkish rule. The Turkish force consisted of about 300 regulars, with 4 or 5 hundred other armed men. The forces of Shehr and Mukalla united at Burum (an anchorage near Mukalla) to resist the intruders. The Turks were defeat ed with considerable loss, and fled to Sharma, whither the chief of Shehr sent a force to dislodge them. In January 1851 the Naqib of Mukalla feariftg a second attempt by the Turks offered the port to the British Govern ment ; but the proposal was declined. Shehr and Mukalla were formerly centres of active traffic in slaves from Zanzibar and the east coast of Africa. The slaves wero despatched to the Yemen, the Hijaz and tho per sian Gulf. In May 1863 an engagement (No„ LXXIII) wcm b220 concluded with the chief of the Kasadi sub-division of th© Yafa'I, who was Naqib of Mukalla, by which he agreed to abolish the trade in his dominions, and the chief of Shehr entered in to a similar engagement. Meanwhile the struggle between the Kathiri and Yafa'i continued, and the Ka'aiti, a sub-tribe of the Yafa'i,^ besieged and captured Shehr and attacked Mukalla, but were repulsed. The Ka'aiti chief, fearing that his communication with the seaboard might be cut off, applied for assistance to his bro thers, who were in the employment of the Nizam of Hyderabad. In spite of the refusal of the Government of India to allow an armed expedition to be fitted out by Arabs from the Indian coast, the brother of the Ka'aiti chief left Bombay in April 1867, with a party of Arabs, obtained arms and stores at Aden, and, attacking Shehr by land and sea, speedily cap tured that port. An attempt made by the Kathiri in Decem ber to recapture the port was repulsed and the Ka'aiti have since remained in undisputed possession of it. In 1867 a Turkish vessel of war visited Mukalla, and endea voured to assert Turkish sovereignty over Mukalla, Shehr and the whole coast ; but these pretentions were evaded by the chiefs, who desired to obtain the protection of the British flag. In June 1869 the Naqib of Mukalla renewed his request for annexation by the British Government, being still apprehen sive of Turkish aggression; moreover, he had quarrelled with his old ally, the Ka'aiti Chief of Shehr and was not secure from the inroads of the Kathm. The Government of India were unable to accede to the Naqib's desire, but addressed the Fo reign Office with a view to restraining the Turkish authorities from threatening his independence. In 1873 the undertaking to abolish the slave trade was con firmed by the Chiefs of Mukalla and Shehr (No. LXXIV and LXXV). In the same year the Ka'aitT, by force and treachery, com pelled the Kasadi to cede one half of Mukalla, of Bandar Burum and of the district of Al-Harshiyat for a payment of 80,000 dollars (Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. XIII, Appendix IV), Hostilities between the Chiefs of Shehr and Mukalla eonti- nued until 1881 when Government was compelled to inte- ferej and the Ka'aiti Jemadar of Shehr was put in possession21 of Mukalla and its dependencies. He became a British sti pendiary in 1882 (No. LXXVI) and in 1888 a protectorate trea ty (No. LXXVII) was concluded. In 1902 the title of the chief was changed from Jemadar to Sultan. In August 1907 hostilities broke out with the neighbour ing Hamumi tribe, but no fighting of importanes resulted. Kaihiri, The country inhabited by the KathTri tribe was in former ages of vast extent, reaching from the 'Aulaki districts on the west to the Mahri tribe on the east, and including the sea ports of Mukalla and Shehr. Civil wars led to the interfer ence of the Yafa'i, and much of the KathTri territory in the past 40 years came under the sway of the Kasadi and Ka- 5 aiti, and the Kathirl now possess no seaport at all. They have had very little intercourse with the Aden Resi dency. The circumstances that led to the loss of Mukalla and Shehr have been recounted in the history of the Ka'aiti tribe. In 1895 the Kathiri attacked and captured Dhufar but lost it again two years later. Mdhn. The Sultan of the Mahri is also ruler of Soqotra, and our dealings with the tribe have been mainly in connection with that island. They will be found described in the chapter on islands. A protectorate treaty (LXXXII) for Soqotra and its dependencies was concluded in 1886 and another (LXXX- III) for the Mahri tribe in 1888. Subaihl. The Subaihl have always been on bad terms with the 'Ab- dali and have even raided British territory. After the capture of Aden several engage»ments (No. XXVI) were arranged in 1839 with the chiefs of this tribe. Until 1871 the only chiefs enjoying stipends from the British Government were the heads of the Dubaini and Rijai clans. In that year the Mansuri clan attacked and plundered a caravan coming into Aden. A detachment of the Aden Troop, which had been raised in 1865 for police purposes^ was22 despatched against them,, and an action ensued in which ofle of the Chiefs and most of his party were killed. Eventually, in 1871, the Subaihi Chiefs came into Aden and tendered their submission; they also entered into Engagements (No. XXVII) to preserve the peace of the roads; to restore plundered pro perty ; and to abolish transit duties and taxes on the roads passing through their territories, in return for monthly sti- pends. An additional Engagement (No. XXVIII) was also signed in 1871 by the Mansuri Chief, by which he admitted his responsibility for the good behaviour of the Kuraisi. A separate Engagement (No. XXIX) was made in 1871 with the Atifi sub-division of the tribe, by which they agreed to afford protection to shipwrecked seamen of any nation, and to protect and send to Aden deserters from the garrison and shipping. An expedition despatched in 1878 by sea and land was successful in putting a stop, for the time, to the depredations committed by the Barhemi, a sub-tribe of the Subaihi, but on the recrudescence of disorder the whole tribe was put under the control of the 'Abdali (see The 'Abdali, agreement No. XXII); in 1886, however, the Subaihi agreement became in operative, the various Subaihi tribes resumed their old position of independent relations with the Aden Residency, and their stipends were restored to them. In 1889 protectorate Treaties (Nos. XXX and XXXI) were made with the Atifi and Barhemi. These were ratified on the 26th February 1890. In April, 1899, owing to continual robberies by the Subaihi the 'Abdalis were given permission to occupy Ras-ul-Ara, Turan, and Umm Rija. In November the Atifi attacked an 'Abdali post, but whan the 'Abdali collected a large force the Atifi submitted. In 1904 the boundary was delimited, a column being sent from Aden to Dar-ul-Kudaimi to support the commission in case of need, but except for a little sniping no opposition was offered. Since then, although inteiference with caravans, dissen sions between the various sections, and quarrels with the 'Ab dali have been frequent, no serious troubles have arisen.Wahid Tlie tribe takes it name from the founder, Abdul Wahid, a Koreish chieftain who became independent about a hundred years ago when the dominion over Yemen of the Imams of San'a came to an end. He conquered a large portion of the territory from the surrounding tribes and established his prin cipal residence at Habban, a town formerly of considerable importance. The Wahidi are a Hadhramailt tribe. In 1885, Hadi-bin-Salih being made the principal Sultan, the Waliidi were practically united under one ruler; but the title of Sultan is borne by several subordinate Chiefs belonging to the ruling family. Until recent years this tribe had had no dealings with the Aden Residency, but their country was visited by Captain Miles and M. Werner Munzinger, C. B., in 1870. In the beginning of 1882 'Izzat Pasha was appointed Tur kish Governor-Ceneral of Yemen, and on his way from Baghdad to Hodeida to take up his appointment, visited Balahaf and Bir 'All. No agreement of any kind was made between him and the Sultan of Balahaf; but Nasir-bin-'Abdulla, one of the Sultans of Balahaf, apprehensive that Balahaf might be annexed by the Ka'aiti Chief of Shehr and Mukalla, ob tained a Turkish flag, which was to be hoisted every Friday and on the approach of a foreign vessel. The Wahidi Sultan of Habban and 'Izzan, while denying all complicity in the mat ter, stated his inability to prevent the Sultans of Balahaf from flying the Turkish flag, and proclaimed his readiness to go against them with British aid. From the correspondence which took place in connection with this incident, it appeared that the then Wahidi Sultan of Habban and 'Izzan had little, if any, control over Bir Ali, Balahaf, and Majdaha. It was eventually decided to enter into closer relations with the Wahidi, and with this view protectorate Treaties (Nos. LXJX and LXX), similar to that executed by the Chief of Soqotra were concluded in 1888 with the Sultans of Bir 'Ali and Balahaf. In March 1895 a protectorate Treaty (No. LXXI) was con cluded with the Sultan Salih-bin-'Abdulla.24 On 1st June, 1896, an amended protectorate Treaty (No. LXXII) was concluded with the Wahldi of Bir 'AH. Daring 1901 the Wahldi complained of Ka'aiti intrigues and asked for British protection; and the Wahidi requested that Muhsin -bin-Salih the ex-Sultan, might be recognised as titular chief, but their request was refused. In 1902 Muhsin-bin-Salih plundered a Ka'aiti boat contain ing specie. The Resident proceeded to Bajahaf with a small force. As Muhsin-bin-Salth failed to give up the plunder, the fort at Balahaf was demolished, and the Resident returned to Aden, bringing with him Sultan Ahmad-bln-Salih, Muhsin's brother, as a political prisoner. The port was closed against all shipping. In October the specie was restored, but it was not until December 1904 that Sultan Muhsin-bin- Salih came into Aden and tendered his submission. He was forgiven his past misdeeds. His brother was released, and he himself has received recognition as Sultan of the Wahidi of Balahaf, in the place of Sultan Salih-bin-'Abdulla, who proved himself a weak and inefficient ruler and gained the disapprobation of his tribe and the censure of Government by an attempt to part with his share of the port Balahaf to the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla. On the occasion of Sultan Muh sin's recognition the opportunity was taken to reaffirm with him the protectorate Treaty of 1895 (No. LXXI). Yafa'l. This tribe is divided into two sections, the Upper and Lower Yafa'i. Their territory inland is very extensive, but the mari time districts east of Aden, which formerly belonged to the tribe, were wrested from them by the Fadhli shortly before our capture of Aden in 1839. Upper The Upper Yafa'i are said to have separated from the Lower Yafa'i about one hundred years ago. In 1894-95 several of the Shaikhs visited San'a and acknow ledged Turkish authority. Very little intercourse was held with the Upper Yafa'i till 1903 when it was proposed to demarcate the frontier. Protecto rate treaties (Nos. LV to LX) were then concluded with the Dhubi, Mausatta, Muflahi, Hadhrami and Shaibi sections, and with the Sultan as titular chief of the whole tribe.© 25 In the same year some of the Musatta tribe attacked a British survey party at Awabil. The attack was repulsed, but, as the Turks declared that any advance into the Bad 3 district would imperil the negotiations then proceeding bet ween the two countries, the idea of surveying the north-east irontier was abandoned. However the boundary line in Shaibi 'country was demarcated and the Shaikh of that section un- dertook to keep the pillars in repair '(No. LXI). In 1904^ the Sultan Kahtan-bin-'tJmar was deposed by his brother, Salih, because of the agreement entered into with the British Government, and all attempts to reinstate him failed although a sum of 3,000 dollars was given in aid by Government.' In 1906 there were differences between the Mausatta sec- tion and the Turkish tribes of Juban and Na'wa. From time immemorial there has been close commerce between the Yafo'i, Juban and Na'wa, and the disagreements were settled in the following year. The Yafa'i Shaikhs displayed satisfaction at our withdra wal from the Hinterland, and since then have generally been more friendly, owing no doubt to there being less interference with their affairs. Lower Yafa'i, The^Lower Yafa'i were formerly subject to the Imams of San'a, but established their independence. SoOn after the capture of Aden an engagement (No. LIII) was entered into with the Sultan, similar to that concluded with the 'Abdali and Padhli chiefs, and has been loyally adhered to. Hostilities broke out with the Fadhli in 1873 over the use 6f the water of the Nazi'a for irrigation. The ill-feeling was aggravated in the beginning of 1876 by the aid given by the Yafa'i to the chief of Dirjaj against the Fadhli. But in July of that year the Nazi'a Question was temporarily settled and soon after the chief of Dirjaj submitted to the Fadhli and rela tions improved. In 1888 in consequence of territorial disputes with the Fadhli and the building by the latter of a fort at Bir Majhar, the Yafa'i again cut off the supply of the Nazi'a and attacked the fort, but were repulsed. The feud continued, interrupted C387GSB i is k26 by occasional shorf truces, till 1894. In that year the Turks tried to induce the Sultan to accept Turkish suzerainty, but without success, and in the following year we concluded a protectorate treaty (No. LIV) with the Sultan. In 1902 the Eadhli Sultan established a customs, post at Zanzibar and levied dues on Yafa'i Caravans. The Yafal retaliated by cutting off the water supply from the Nazi'a. The Fadhli then attacked Al-Hasan and Ar-Rawwa. In 1904 they also attacked Raha and occupied Khanfar. No settle ment has yet been arrived at. Our relations with the present Sultan of the Lower Yafa'i are somewhat strained owing partly to his dissatisfaction with the position accorded to cerain sections of the Upper Yafa'i, over whom he is inclined to assert a claim to general suzerain ty, and oartly to his dissatisfaction with the rank and precedence assigned to himself. Soqofra. The island &lt;jf Soqotra waa famed in ancient times for the incense which it exported to Egypt and was known at a later period to the Greeks and Romans as the island of Dioscori- des. In 1507 an expedition of fourteen sail of the line under Tristan da Cunha and Alfonso D 7 Albuquerque was despatched by the king of Portugal to protect the Christian inhabitants of the island. The Portugeuse attacked a fort on the north coast in the neighbourhood of the present capital, Tamridah, garrisoned by Mahri Arabs from Qishn. They succeeded in capturing it, but not until all the defenders were killed. We entered into relations with the Mahri chief of Soqotra in 1834, when he agreed to the establishment of a coal depot. The subsequent occupation of Aden rendered this concession of no value, but the advantage of the island as a refuge for gj^p-^f0(»]j©d crews, or as a station for a lighthouse, ied to the continuance of close and friendly relations with its rulers. In 1886 a formal protectorate was established over the Sultan, who undertook to enter into no arrangements with any foreign power except with the sanction of the British Government,27 CHAPTER II, Geography. General description. The British Protectorate of Aden extends from the neigh bourhood of the Red Sea to Ras Sighair (Sajar) near the fifty-fourth degree of east longitude, and consists of a littoral belt of lowland occasionally fertile, an irregular mountain range run ning parallel to the coast line, and, farther inland, a desert plateau. The low-lying and sandy coastal plains are intersected by the beds of mountain torrents which, however, except in time of flood, do not reach the sea. These are the only sites of cultivation and water can usually be obtained by digging in the river bed. In many places the surface soil consists of a silty alluvium which has been brought down from the hills by the streams in the ordinary manner of delta formation, and in these cases there is rich cultivation. Between the cultivated lands there are large stretches of blown sand, which has been carried by the winds and overlies the alluvium. This process is contin ually going on as the sandstone formation of the central plateau disintegrates under the action of the air and changes of tem perature. Between Shaikh Sa'id and Aden the coast is entirely devoid of cultivation, the soil being either soft sand or hard desert sparsely covered with mimosa thorn. East of Aden in the Fadhli country, cultivation and villages are found within a mile or two of the shore. Beyond Maqatin, to the east, the sandy coast is varied with low rocky points and commanding head lands, the greater part being uninhabited, and cultivation only occurring in the neighbourhood of towns and villages. Behind the low sandy littoral rise the irregular mountain- ranges that border the central plateau. These reach their high est elevations in the west, where they join the mountains of Yemen They are cut through by numerous well-defined wddls, most of which, however, are dry except in flood time. In the west fertile little valleys lie between the ridges, and farther north where many of the ranges are flat-topped and elevated table lands occur, cultivation is carried to the summits and slopes by means of terraced fields. ^28 The most tertile tracts are the western hiily region bor dering on Turkish territorv, a description of which will be found below, under the heading 'Tribal Areas', and that portion of the Hadhramaut lying south of the sixteenth parallel of latitude and east of the 47th degree of east longitude. Singularly fer tile and self-sufficing, the settled districts of Hadhramaut are so situated geographically as to hang closely- together, and to be isolated as a whole from the rest of the peninsula ; while at the same time they lie within reach of ports which are in con stant eommunieation with mid-eastern Africa and India. The main fertile valley of the region, carrying the drainage of the south-eastward slope of the highlands of Southwest Arabia, lies for a long distance (about five hundred miles) l almost paral lel to the coast, but screened by a high desert plateau. The fact that its waters are'absorbed in the irrigation of this long de pression leaves the last hundred miles of the main wddl a de sert, and removes the oasis tracts from direct contact with the sea. To the north stretches unbroken the most terrible waste of eand-dunes in Arabia (Alaqaf), never, to our knowledge, crossed; and farther east is the firmer, but not less, waterless, desert of' Mahra. Boundary. Tbe boundary line begins at Husn Murad, near Perim, and; extends over 200 miles to a.point on the river Bana, near Ka'taba, From here onwards a line drawn north-east from Lakmat-us- Shub, a village in Amiri territory, defines the dividing line of the sphere of influence of the two powers. On this frontier, the most important section is that comprised by the Amir of DhUla's, the Haushabl, and a portion of the Subaihi territories. Through these districts pass the main trade routes from Turkish Yemen, and they are also the only- routes which could be utilised by a force advancing into British territory from Turkish Yemen, or the converse. These main lines of advance may be brought under three heads, and it is proposed to consider shortly how the frontier, as at present estabhshed, affects each—■ [a) Through the Dhala valley from northern Yemen (San'a Yerim, etc.). \ Through the Tiban valley from, Ta'izz and Ma via.t-Z (c) From the Naqll Hamra past Mafalis and down the Wadi Ma'adin. With regard to (a), the boundary crosses the valley drained by the Sailat Ka'taba, and bounded to the north and west by the high and precipitous mountains of Al-Aud, through which the main route to San'a passes. Any move from the British side of the border, either to the north or to the west, would entail the ascent of high passes, both difficult and susceptible of effi cient defence. The Turkish advance on the other hand, though across the undulating Dhala vallev, would encounter the chain of low hills stretching from near A1 Jalila towards Jabal Harir, which present a line of positions which must be passed before reaching the heada of the passes, at Khuraiba and Ar-Kabad, leading down from Dhala to the lower-lying country. Assuming that this were accomplished, their only route would be down a river-bed commanded by steep hills on either side, or by side tracks, barely passable for transport, over most difficult mountainous country. With respect to (6)^ an advance from Ma via would encounter a line of low hills on the British side, very close to the actual bound ary, which effectually command the valley as it opens out at the south foot of the Ma via pass, and the open plateau of the Habil Arabi. These positions, it is true, would be within distant fire from heavy artillery from the Jalisa-Am Amma (Turkish) range, but the difficulty of getting big guns iato effective positions, if indeed possible at all, would be so great, that this scarcely comes within the scope of practical politics. In the first instance, it would involve the existence of such guns, which is extremely doubtful, and in the second, the makingapf roads practicable for them. On the other hand, any advance on Ma via would involve the passage of the Mavia pass, a defile easily defensible by light artil lery and musketry. An advance on Mavig, from the east, by the WadlsTusanandHilhal, would also encounter great natural diffi culties. An advance from the Turkish side from Ta'izz would be most difficult against opposition. The actual western frontier of the Amii Haushabi follows generally the crest line of a chain of hills, completely commanding the extensive plain in Turkish territory to the west. This chain is passable for transport at four points by the Wadis Akkan (or Natid), tho Warezan, the S^iilafenffff 30 Sudan, and by the Wadi Hakab. In each case the passage is in the nature of a defile to which access could be effectively barred by the high ground on the British side of the actual boundary. The Amri country itself also presents positions which it would be difficult to pass, while still further back, the vicinity of the junction of the Akkan with the Tiban, forms a position, the forcing of which may be regarded as practically impossible. It must also be remembered that by the Tiban route alone would water in sufficient quantity for a force, large enough to attempt such offensive measures be found. lor an advance from Amri territory in the direction of Ta'izz, the initial advantage of terrain would lie on the side of the British. The Akkan-Natid route is, for some distance at any rate, commanded by the high Turkish hills to the south (the Yusufi range), but an advance across the low-lying Badu country near the course of the Sudan and Warezan would appear possible. The country between the Badu and Ta'izz, as far as can be seen from the hills of Humala and Tinsum, is broken by low hills, and natural difficulties, favouring defence, would no doubt present themselves. The only thing that can be said in the absence of a survey of this tract, is that we know the country beyond the Turkish border near Ta'izz to be low lying, comparatively level, well-watered and fertile, and gene rally more practicable at this point than are the other portions of the frontier. With regard to (c), the heights are entirely in possession of the Turks, and the Naqil Hamra, though a good road, possess es such facilities for defence, as to be practically impregnable. On the other hand, the Wadi Ma'adin, on the British side of the frontier, offers several positions dominating the surround ing low-lying country, and a long desert march, the few wells being either held or rendered useless, would effectually check any forward movement, even if these positions were passed. The western border, north-eastwards from Lakmat-us- Shub, in its present undefined condition, need only be touched on very briefly in as far as it affects the military aspect of the the frontier. The main barrier to any Turkish encroachments to the east is the exceedingly difficult and high mountainous country of the Yafa'i tribe, a warlike and independent race of great numerical strength. The Turkish district of Rada lies on the lofty tableland, some 30 miles to the north -west31 of the line from Lakmat-us-Shub. any aggressive move of theirs towards the east would almost certainly meet with onnn sition from the tribes in very difficult country, nor is there any route which would permit of an advance south-east, through Yafa, or along the Bana, which in that part flows between high and precipitous hills. ween In fact, to summarise the situation as regards the Anolo- Tnrkish frontier the hrgh ranges and mountain passes m the hands of the Turks except in the TaW-Haushihi portion and should eSeotuaily bar any advance from our side l.l on the British side of the frontier, .treng poeitTl^eur on every route, which although not so commanding, are DerLn« tactically better fitted, and more easily adaptable, for defence It is possibly rather unnecessary to imagine so unlikelv a situation as hostilities in Yemen, between Great Britain and Tnr key involving an advance from one side or the other esoe' cialiy in a country in which places capable of supplying even a brigade, with sufficient water, and food or forage are &lt;3 rare occurrence, and in which marching bv detach be a necessity. At the same time, if Jm. ^rththZto attempt to give a general idea of what the strategical a pect of the frontier is, at the points where the main routes crossTt nor^surveye^ 111 ' 61 ^ ^ fr0ntier ^ neither visited Mountains. The buttress range, Jabal Sabar, which falh ih a c* u of Bab-el-Mandeb, forms a sort of gabt westward and the southward slopes of the Arabkn mnf w ! of the fiftieth degree of longitude the soutwTslone of^h plateau is much disturbed by hard intrusive rocks whioh ! through the calcareous mass, now stand up as shnrf ' I chains of varying direction. To the eL thT is more gentle and the general elevation appears to be lower In the Subaihi country, in the south-west corner, the mari' time range bordering the Red Sea roughlv follow*+l!f r * the coast at a distance of about ten m les ffit 0 ! parallel lines. The mountains are wyrlged a^ ^ void of vegetation and, as a rule, difficult of ascent. Theprin' cipal peaks are, the curious point of J. Sin Samfi A ® 2.834 ft. J. Umm Wusid, ^ and the almost elated massea of J. u mm32 nnd J. Kharaz 2,7&lt; j 6 feet, the end of the nlaritiiile range abufc ting on the sea coast. Further inland, to the east, a succes sion of -ranges border the numerous idcidls draining south towards Turan, rising about 1,000 feet above the level of th6 river beds, while to the north-west, on the boundary line of the Protectorate, a group of high mountains, of a general altitude of 4,000 to 6,000 feet occurs, of which the most noticeable p eaks are the isolated range of J. Hawab, J. Rasin in Turkish territory^ and the long ridge of J. Jardad which forms the beginning oi the system running roughly east and west across Southern Yemen. The mountains at this point form a water-shed, the wadls in British territory (with one or two exceptions) drains ing south, while those on the Turkish side* of which the^Wi Umm Ghail is the principal, drain west to the Red Sea. To the east of Jardad and J. Umm Ibdar, the ZuraikI hills* of which the principal peak is J. Manif, 6,856 feet, cut through by the Wadls 'Ubil and Adim, carry on the scarp towards the long ridge of J. Iraf, which turning almost north, on the west bank of the waits Ma'ad in, connects this line with the highest range in Southern Yemen, that extending in an unbroken line from J. Sabar near Ta'izz to the Tiban. The mountain Wall from Hawab eastwards in roughly the north-west bounds ary of the British Protectorate, the foot-hiUs of the main ranges^ and in a few cases, the exterior ridge only, being in Subaihi territory. North of the high J. Sabar range, of which the extremities east of the Kubati and Yusufi mountains, are in the posses ion of the Juhaili-Subaihi and 'Amri-Haushabi respectively, is th6 'Amri country, consisting of broker! low hills. To their north, another high range runs east and west, its western ex tremity curving to the south; from J. Jalisa On the south west to J. Jarban, and thence east to J. Am Amma (7,313 feet) and J. Warwa (5,879 feet)the portion of this range, west of J. Basaisa, is Turkish and east of it, Haushabi. To the east of the Tiban, in Haushabi Country, between it and the Wadi-Ul-Milah, lies an irregular mass of bare and rugged mountains between 3,000 and 4,000 feet high, while to their east again are the Dhanbari hills, the southernmost range of the Radfan system. Bordering the Tiban on the west, is a high mountain wall, pierced in places by wddls draining east to the 'liban, of which the main feature is the mass of J. Hasha (8,417I o 24 33 feet), the lower eastern spurs being in the territory of the Amir of Dhala. The Amiri country is entirely composed of mountains of an excessively rugged and abrupt description. On the east is the continuous range formed by Jabal Harir (7,790 feet) a flat- topped ridge running north to south, with exceedingly steep and precipitous sides falling away to the Bana, and J. Halmin connected with Harir by a col, a rugged mountain, rising steeply on the west in sharp peaks and running eastwards fn long ridges to the Bana. In the centre are the Shairi hills, and the rugged promontory Jutting out from the head of the Dhala valley, and culminating in the remarkable plateau of Adh-Dhu- bayyat, whence it falls away in a series of rocky foot-hills to the Suhaib valley. The north-western part is occurWl by the great mountain mass of J. Jahaf (7,840 feet), the summit of which contains fertile valleys and slopes and which extends southwards in two great spurs, the easterly, culminating in the bluff of J. Mafarl (6,490 feet), and the westerly, forming the HumaidT mountains, with the abrupt pinnacles of J. Mism-ir. (7,033 feet) and J. Seyan. On the north are sheer precipices of 2,000 feet. The south-western part of the AmTri country is an intricate mass of rugged mountains, separated from the Jahaf system by the deep gorge of the Tabaghain, of which the most conspicuous peaks to the north are J. un-Nad (7,131 feet) and J. Mashwara (6,355 feet), continuing down to the Haushabi mountains be tween the Tiban and the Wadi-ul-Milah. The Radfan range, in the south-eastern corner, juts to the north in bold spurs, and falls away on the east to the Bana The principal peak is J. ul Huria (8,107 feet), and the range encloses fertile valleys. To the north of J. Harir in Amm territory, are the Shaibi mountains, connected with Harir on the south, and with Maiais on the west. They are excessively steep and rugged, but contain fertile valleys. J. Awabil (7,647 feet) is the principal peak. North of the ShaibT, across the Bana, is the high plateau ofRub'- aUain with J. Anitha, and J. Shamroh (7,900 feet), as its most conspicuous peaks. To the east of the Shaibi mountains, and separated from them by the Bana, are the lofty and rugged peaks of the Upper Yafa'i, which present an inhospitable and serrated front to the south. The higher points, of which J. Al'Ali is C387GSB F34 the principal, rise to above 8,000 feet, and enclose deep valleys which are said to be very fertile. They have, as yet, not been visited by Europeans. To their south, separated from the Radfan mountains by the Bana, are the Lower Yafa'i hills, which rise at their highest point, in Jabal Maufaja, to 7,276 feet, and are composed of short ridges running east and west, well wooded, and with the slopes cultivated by terraced fields. To their south again, separated from the Lower Yafa'i by the River Hasan, is the maritime range of the Fadlili tribe, the peaks varying from some 2,000 feet to 6,596 feet (J. Urais). Eastwards of the Yafa'i and Fadhll mountains lies an un- surveyed tract, concerning which there is very little informa tion, though the naval charts show a practically continuous range of high mountains running parallel to the coast. The main system in the Aulaki country is, from the account of Mr. Bury, who traversed the country some 5 years back, the chain of the Kaur-ul-Audilla, which crosses the country between the Upper and Lower 'Aulaki, from east to west, and of which the estimated height of the highest peak is about 8,000 feet. J ahdf. Jabal Jahaf is a considerable mountain mass which bounds the Dhala plain on the west. Its highest point, Jabal Manara, is 7,840 feet high. The central part is in the form of a broken plateau with an average elevation of 7,000 feet. The northern and southern parts take the form of long irregular spurs of con siderable height and steepness, with deep narrow valleys between. The principal valleys on the north are the Wadi Sewat, and the Wadi Ma tar, and the three main northern spurs are Jabal ul-Urr, Haidh-ul-Kasas, and Jabal Umail, On the south, the principal valley is that, which in its upper course is called the Wadi-ur-Rahan, in its middle course the Sailat-ul-Habil, and in its lower course Wadi-ul-Bun. It is between the Mafarl spur on the east, and the Humaidi spur on the west. Another valley, the Wadi Ma'bar, taking its rise among the peaks east of Sarir, runs south-east, and drains to the cultivated lands west of Dhala town. Tha central and northern parts are inhabited by the Ah] Jahaf, and the western part by the Bani Sa'id. The central plateau is bounded on the north by a row of peaks, he most prominent of which are Jabal Manara, Jabal Ba Kudac.ir,35 Jabal-un-Nauba and Jabal Masna*. On the east is a serrated ridge, the highest points of which are Jabal Rabek-and Jabal Shijan, with ruined buildings upon them. Near the village of Kama is the shrine of Wall Sahib-ur- Rubat and just below the summit of Jabal Manara is a tomb, about 20 feet long, reputed to be that of Nabi Sha'ib or Jethro, father-in-law of Moses. The summit of Jabal Jahaf commands an extensive view to the north over the plain country of Al-Hajar to the mountains of Jabal Sha'r, Jabal-ul-Aud, and Jabal Marais, and west up the Tiban valley to Jabal Suhban. All the central part of Jabal Jahaf has a good and plentiful water-supply from numerous wells and springs, and there is a very considerable extent of cultivated ground. Besides the usual crops of millets, peas, sesamum, etc., irrigated crops of wheat, barley and Indian corn are grown in some of the valleys, and there are a few coffee plantations. Waras (bastard saffron) is grown in places, and a rose garden was seen near the villags of Shima, Approaches to Jdbal Jahdf. Nail Suaida. —From Dhala to Karna. A good camel road, 8 feet wide, and with a ruling gradient of 1 in 8, well drained, with culverts and Irish bridges, was made by the troops of the Aden column in 1903. Distance from Dhala to Karna 5^ miles. Total ascent about 2,000 feet. From Dhala the road runs north-west across fields to the ridge, which connects Jabal Jahaf with JabaJ Mafari, ascends a steep spur by zigzags, and, at 2 miles, passes below the Azraki village of Thalat on a rocky crag, then goes over a col and past the deserted site of Subahrir at 2f miles. The road runs north at 3 miles leaving the Mafari village of Suaida to the west, skirts the base of a cliff and turns west to the site of the camp occupied in 1903 just below the village of Balas (3J miles). The road then descends for a short distance, and, at 4 miles, ascends to a small plateau which was the site of another camp. The road continues northwards passing Al-Asdaf on the right and Bude'a on the left, then ascends to the steep southern slope of Karna plateau by a series of zigzags and after a level | f236 mile reaches the plateau, 5| miles, over a short bit of paved road. {From report by Major Crawford.) Naqil Shedud.—A steep footpath, but not difficult, leads up the ravine of the Wad! Ma'bar, at first following the watercourse past the village of A1 Humra, then ascending the rocky slopes, passing Dar-ul-Haifa, and issuing on to the Jahaf plateau near Sarir. ^ Distance from Dhala to Sarir about 5 milegL A I mile above Al-Humra a path branches west and ascends steeply to Balas and Karna. Naqll-ush-Shima or Naqil~uih~Dliahar. —From near OI Su- maid on the Ash-Shiraf District a steep footpath ascends from below the spur of Adh-Dhahar. The path is very stony and winding, and the ascent is a trying one of about 1,000 feet before the path debouches on the cultivated valley in which Ash-Shima, Al-Madad, etc, are situated. When the Turks had a garrison on Jabal Jahaf they used to send mules up and down this Naqil. Naqtl-ul-Haib* —The only approach on the north side of Jahaf which is practicable for camels. The ascent begins near the village of Hadana in the Dakkam country, and is a very tedious one of fully 2,000 feet in 3 miles. The path reaches the summit of the western, Sabra, ridge, near the villages of Al-Haib and Kumala, but there is still a rocky ascent of 200 feet before the Tillage of Yaqub Lakma on the Jahaf plateau is reached. The following are steep foot-paths only :— Naqil Matwat. —From Matwat to Al-Hakl. Naqil Rukba. —From Rukba in the Dakkam country to Sabra. Naqll Ghumrog. —From the Dakkam country up the Wadi Matar to Sharan and Hadur. Naqll Jem. —Up the Wadi Sewat to Jabal Manara. Naqll ud Danaha. —From Danaba on the east up to Madad^ Naqll Tabl. —From Wadi Ma'bar to Subahrir. Naqll Morejaha. —From Al-Haud near Dhala to Aifar. There are also a few steep approaches from the Humaidi country.37 Majaru The following description of Jabal Mafari is mostly taken from a report by Major Crawford, R.A. :— Jabal Mafari is a conspicuous mountain, the summit of which is in the form of a plateau about half a mile square, and with an average elevation of about 6,000 feet. If forms as it were the south-eastern bastion of the Jabal Jahaf system, with which it is connected on its northern side by a col known as Kharif Rahwa about 900 feet below the summit. On the south and east it overlooks the Azraki valley, on the west the valley of the Wadi- ul-Bun which divides it from the Humaidi country. Its eastern northern, and western faces consist of sheer precipices from 100 to 250 feet high, from the foot of which the ground slopes, steeply to. the valleys beneath. On the southern side the slopes, though more gradual, are still precipitous in parts, and are broken up by detached rocks and outlying spurs. The plateau on the top is not flat, but in the form of a horse shoe shaped depression sloping southwards, gently at first, but getting gradually steeper and contracting in width to a narrow exit. The centre of this depression is occupied by the village, Madmat-ul-Mafari, with Naqib Ghalib's tower of Malama, while on the northern and western edges of the plateau are command ing eminences crowned by towers, Dar Tuwarak, and Dar Lakama. Some distance below to the south is the shrine of Wali Hadej-bin-Muhammad. Jabal Mafari is a position of great natural strength, but the entire absence of water on its summit goes far towards discount ing this advantage. Catchment areas and reservoirs might be made to collect rain water. There is a considerable quantity of lime at the top of the northern approach. Approaches The main approach is from the col Kharif Rahwa, (5,160 feet) on the northern side. Paths lead to this col as follows :— (a) From Dhala: Leaving Dhala town the path, which leads towards the Azraki country, is followed south to near the head of the Naqil Darjat-un-Nishfi. Then turn west over an easy pass, then down a steep wind ing descent to cross the Sailat Mithman.38 Path continues west, fairly level, passes deserted village of Dar Dawaja, and a well called Mahalat-ur~Ruhba, thrn a stiff rocky winding ascent of 800 feet to Kharif Rahwa ; 5 miles. (&amp;) From As-Suaida in the Uzlat Mafari: Path leads south past Anim, and down a spur, steep in places : 2^ miles. (c) From the valley of the Wadi-ul-Bun. Ascent of 2 miles. Not difficult. Good spring half way up. Major Crawford describes the ascent from Kharif Rahwa to Jabal Mafari as follows:— The ascent from the col to the foot of the cliff is by a zigzag path. The cliff itself is negotiated through the medium of a cleft or 'chimney' from side to side of which the path crosses, the returns getting shorter, narrower, and steeper towards the top. This path is built of stone and is well, and ingeniously constructed, in some parts being carried on wooden beams. It is said to have been put into its present state of repair by the Turks, who occupied the mountain with a small force in 1902. It is practicable for infantry only. ' The ascent is about 1,000 feet. Donkeys are taken up this path. A second approach is from the Azraki village of Mojaran at the eastern foot; a foot path ascends, passes above Wali Hadej-bin- Muhammad, and reaches the summit from its southern side. A third approach is from the Azraki village of Al-Masns ' at the southern foot of Jabal Mafari, a foot-path ascending by Wall Hadej. Water. ' There is no spring nor natural source : only a few tanks for collecting rain-water. When these are exhausted water must be fetched from springs beneath the mountain. There are two of these:— (a) Ghail Hufaira in the ravine running from the col on the north to the Wadi-ul-Bun : the spring is about 250 feet below the col. (b) A spring below the ravine by which the tableland of the summit drains to the south. ' {Crawford,) The Uzlat Mafari, 2J to 3 miles north of Jabal Mafan, is on the western slopes of a conspicuous hill to the west of Dhala, called Jabal Bayada. The Uzlat comprises an extensive basin of terraced cultivation, most oi which drains west to the Sailat- uI-Habil, the water-course which divides the Mafari from the39 Humaidi. The distance from Dhala is 3 miles, and the ascent is made by an easy pass, the Naqll Suaida (see Jahaf) to the vil lage of Suaida. The Mafari boundary on the north is here marked by the rocky slopes oi Safa Saha, above which is the southernmost group of Jabaf villages, Balas, Ukema, Al-Asda c , and Bude'a. These belonged formerly to the Mafari. Harlr. The high ridge of Jabal Hanr rises to the east of the Dhala plain, from the centre of which its summit is about 8 miles dis tant. The ridge extends nearly 5 miles north and south, and the highest point (about 7,800 feet) is a little north of the centre. The top is mostly bare rock shelving to the west and from i a mile to 1J miles wide ;there are many depressions in which there is fertile soil cultivated in terraced fields. On the east the shelf breaks abruptly away in crags and precipices, below which long rocky spurs run out eastwards with sheltered valleys between, where wheat, barley and coffee are grown. These valleys from north to south are the Sailat Baka'in, Sailat Adina, Sailat Seika, Sailat Asha and Sailat Moghar 'AH, all draining to the Sailat Shara, and so to the Wadi Bana. To the west the mountain shelves gradually from its crest line for a mile on an average then falls steeply to the Wadi-un-Nauba which lower down becomes the Wadi-ud-Dabab. A col connects Jabal Harir on the north with Jabal Awabil of the Shaibi. The descent to this col from the village of Ad- Bahira at the northern end of Jabal Harir is very precipitous. On the south Jabal Harir is connected with Jabal Obaira of the Halmin by a low col, across which leads the Naqil Sait pass on the route from Dhala to Mahjaba ; a steep path leads down to it from the southern point of Jabal Harir. On the highest point of Jabal Harir half a mile east of Al- Fokaha is a shrine known as Wall-ul-Ma'ud, a white tomb in a walled enclosure, with tanks lined with cement. An extensive view is obtained of the Shaibi country to the north, the Yafa hills to the east, and the Halmin hills to the south, and the Dhala country and hills beyond to the west. The northern part of Jabal Harir, with the villages of Ad- Dahira, Arshi and Marat, belongs to the Muflahi division of40 the Yafa. Ad-Dabira stands conspicuously on the northern most point, of Jabal Harir wjiile Arshi and Marat are just below to the east in a sheltered valley with a wide extent of cultivated land and several wells. Approaches to Jabal Harir, There are 3 approaches to Jabal Harir at its north-western shoulder. 1. Naqll Haban, —This is the only approach to Jabal Hanr practicable for camels, and it is only fit for lightly laden camels carefully led. The road from Dhala to the foot of Naqil Haban starts north east past Kabar, and south of Jabal Shahad, then turns north, leaving Kurain, Mashak, and 01 Sabula to the rightj and Lak- mat Hajfar, Haiaz, and Kurai to the left. At 5 miles turns east up the Wadi Haslab passing Rakka on the left; Dar-ul- Hajaf and Dariba on the right; enters the cultivated valley of Sarara at 7 miles. Over a low ridge into the Kharba valley and up it. At 9 miles is a running stream, Ghail Haban, two good springs and camping ground (Asfal Naqil Haban). Hence the route follows an old Himiaritic paved road, which Major Crawford describes as follows :— The route follows the old Himiaritic paved road—an interest ing relic: though washed away in several places it can be ascended by camels loaded up to 200 lbs. The road whem in repair has a minimum breadth of 10 feet and is of solid construction. Per pendicular faces are surmounted by zigzags and in some places it is carried along rocky slopes a considerable distance by build ing up level. It is regularly stepped in places where the slope is too steep to admit of ramping. It is overgrown in some parts and in a few places has quite fallen into decay, fortunately not in any essential places. In traversing comparatively level stretches of rock its course is marked out by low stone parapets—a bad plan as they tend to confine the water that falls on the road, to deliver it on the paved portions lower down, and wash these away. On the other hand where the road is led along steep rocky slopes, on the edge of pre cipices, or in the zigzags, where a parapet would be really useful, there are no traces of its having ever existed. , Proceeding up the road, which is about 4 miles long and in volves a rise of about 2,200 feet, a pool of drinking water is passed41 and tlie roa.d proceeds in an easterly direction up a spur with A deep ravine on either side. The western side of the spur is generally adhered to, until a col which practically divides Harif into two parts is reached. The village of Dahira will be seen about 1 mile to the north, Marat far below in the valley to the east and Arshi on a rocky spur just opposite the col. These are three Muflahi villages. Turning south, Fokaha is approach ed up a narrow ravine with cultivation (including coffee) in it. and a col is reached, having Fokaha just above on the east and Hauta (a new village with a mosque) on the west. Half a mile of gentle descent through intermittent culti vation and camping ground is reached just opposite Masna (2 dars) and separated from it by a ravine. Just below in the ravine is a spring suitable for washing purposes and a well Bir Marhad (6 feet square, 12 feet deep with 5 feet of water i'n it and good to drink). The camping ground is small and pleasantly sited. Wood is difficult to get and should be sent up from below if possible. Camel grazing is scanty. The infantry work ing very easy and with frequent halts took about hours over this march. 2. Naqll Tesarcm.—From Al-Malaha in the Shairi country a path leads east to Ar-Rakka at the foot of Jabal Harlr, and thence a footpath goes due east up a ridge to Al-Fokaha, miles from Ar-Rakka, 6| from Al-Malaha. 3. N aqil-ul-Kabl. —From Lakmat-un-Nub, which is also reach- ®d by the path from Al-Malaha, a path goes south-east up the western side of Jabal Harir to Dar-ul-Kabl at IJ miles. Thence a very steep footpath up the crags for a mile till the shelving rock of the top is reached, 2 miles over rock and terraced fields by Al-Jos, and Masna' to Al-Fokaha, 4|- miles from Lakmat-un-Nub 8 miles from Al-Malaha. This is the most direct approach from Dhala, via Al-Kurain, Al-Malaha and Lakmat-un-Nub. The only other approaches are very steep foot -paths. Dhuhayyal. The tongue of broken highland which projects 10 miles to the south from Dhala reaches its greatest elevation in the plateau of Adh Dhubayyat at its southern extremity. The plateau is irregular, about | square mile in extent. The greater part is bare, and stony or rocky, On the north the ground is in tlwi C387GSB a42 form of an amphitheatre draining to the west, and contain ing a basin of fertile soil which is cultivated in terraced fields. The southern part is more in the nature of a tablelnnd with flat ledges, partly of bare rock, partly of cultivated ground, a sort of shelf which terminates on the south in abrupt precipices A sheer rock. The whole plateau slopes gradually up to the cul minating point at its eastern end, the rocky hill, on which stands the white shrine of Wall Hasan. Most of the drainage goes west through the amphitheatre above described and down to the Sailat Tuwana, but several deep ravines run down from the southern edge of the plateau ; the largest of these are the Sai lat Tolaba which drains south-east to the Wadi Hardaba, and the Sailat Satab which drains south-west to the Wadi Tuwana. The greater part of the plateau is treeless, but in the fields be low Ad -Dhubayyat village there are several fine Tolak trees, a kind of ficus, and some of the ravines to the south are well wooded with acacia. There are four wells, about 300 yards north of the village and about 50 yards apart. Only two of these are fit for drinking; each contains about 7 feet of water, and the water is 25 feet below the surface in one, and 50 feet in the other. Both are in constant use by the inhabitants. There is a masonry reservoir for rain water half a mile east of the village, which measures about 20 / X 20' X 6^ but it is not in good condition. The distance from Adh-Dhubay}^ to Adh-Dhala by road is 10 miles. Leaving the plateau there is a steep rocky descent and the path is rough and winding for 4 miles, then enters a gorge between rocky hills ; to the east Jabal Da far with ruins of an old Saiyid village and tanks, to the west Jabal Nakha. At 5 miles there dire good springs in the Sailat-ur-Eida, and camping space on the fields of Al-Hukl. Thence a steep stony path leads down, and across the Sailat-ur-Eida to the Az-Zanad plain. From Az-Zanad the path leads over a low stony pass to Zobaid whence Dhala is 3 miles distant by a good path. This route is practi cable for laden camels and for horses, but the roughness of the 1st half makes progress slow. A path practicable for camels, but re ugh, leads south-west from Adh -Dhubayyat down into the Wadi Tuwana, It is known as the Naqil Satab 843 A footpath leads south-east past a precipitous crag known as Bait-ul-Wa'I, and down the Sailat Tolaba into the Wad! Har- daba. A path practicable for camels leads west from Adh-Dhubayya^ down to the head of the Naqil Tuwana, then continues west down the Sailat Suman, passing below Suman, to the Azraki valley near Khushan miles. Shairl. The Shairi hills form a series of parallel ridges, the inter mediate valleys draining westwards into the Dhala valley. The highest peak of Jabal Shairi (6,525 feet) rises conspicuously between the Khuraiba gorge on the west, and that of the Sailat- un-Nauba on the east. Jabal-un-Nad. Jabal-un-Nad (7,131 feet) is a very fine peak, which towers above the valleys of the Tiban and the Tabaghain. Near the summit is a shrine sacred to Nabi Sha'ib, a saint especially venerat ed in this part of Arabia. Near the shrine is a curious cleft which runs down like a chimney to open at the base of a cliff some hundreds of feet below. • The northern, southern and western sides arc very precipi tous. On the east, below the steep upper slopes is a broad valley in which the village of Jabal-bin-Awas is situated. Further oa^t across the deep cleft of the Sha ? b-un-Nakab, is the open plateau of Al-Hakl, with ample camping space, and sufficient water-supply at a height of about 4,500 feet. Rivers. The most important volume of surface water is that thrown off by the highly elevated south-western corner which catches the main monsoon precipitation. This does not run directly to the sea but flows eastwards for a long distance, collecting at last in the Hadhramaut, though.the dry river bed continues to the sea near Saihut. . A series of shorter wddis rise in the southern hills and run southward towards the sea, losing themselves in the sandy plains before they reach it. Wddl Tiban. The valley of the Wadi Tiban practically forms the western boundary of Amiri territory, which it traverses from north to44 ^outh. Its source is in the Turkish sphere of influence beyond the mountain ranges of Jabal Suhban and Jabal Badan, through which it passes before entering the lands of the Dakkam tribe ( Amin). Above this point its course has not been reconnoitred. Traversing the Dakkam territory between steep' banks, with cultivation here and there on each side and the lofty mountain of Jabal Hasha on the right, it enters a deep gorge between that mountain and Jabal Jahaf about half a mile below the village of Karad (Dakkam). Two miles further on a narrow gate, the Bab Fajra ul-'Ali is reached with lofty precipices on either side. Another five miles and the Shab Mofattah, a dry ravine on the right bank is reached marking the boundary between the Dakkam and Ahmadi tribes. Cultivation recommences here and a mile further on is the village of Rahwat-ul-'Abcblla (Ah madi). The junction of the Wadi Tabaghain is reached on the left bank in 2 miles. A well frequented trade route follows the bed of this Wadi and turns down the Tiban. It is made use of by cara vans trading between Dhala, Mavia in Turkish territory and Musaimir (Haushabi). The river bed between Karad and the Tabaghain is but little used as a road. # The going is rough and stony. In the actual pass it involves wading down the bed of the stream often between boulders of considerable size. It would be impracticable^ if the stream were swollen, and dangerous; if there were a chance of a freshet or spate. But under normal conditions though tedious, it can be, and has been, used by men, horses and baggage animals. If an advance party be sent ahead to remove obstacles left by the last floods, the passage of a column will be much facilitated. After passing the confluence of the Tabaghain two small villages are passed on the left bank, a short gorge about half a mile long with a large detached rock in the bed of the stream at either end is traversed, and the Wadi Haura on the right bank is reached 2 miles lower down. A mile further down, the Wadi Tusan comes in on the right bank also nearly opposite the village of Tawarsa. A caravan route to Mavia proceeds up the Tusan. There is another short gorge half a mile further on, on emerging from which Dar-ul-Husain, the residence of the Ahmadi Shaikh, is seen, picturesquely perched on the right bank. Two miles below, the Wadi Hilhal (up which an alternative route to Ma via proceeds) comes in on the right bank just beyond45 Takafal, a well-built village on a bluff on the left bank. The river bed now becomes more open, the hills in the immediate vicinity of it lower, the course of the river is less winding and the crossings constantly fewer. A few poor villages are passed. In 4 miles the Wad! Shan on the left bank is reached and this is the limit of the Ahmadi territory. A little frequented route leading over a steep pass goes up the Wadi to Dhala, traversing MehabI and Azraki territory en route. Continuing down stream the hills close in again, the river resumes its winding course and is frequently dammed for irriga tion purposes, channels leading from field to field, and frequently carried round bluffs of rock supported on built-up banks of stone and sometimes on timber. The villages of Sukamr(both banks) —Mubarak (right bank)—-here the Sailat Mubaraik comes in from Jabal Warwa on the right— and Dirjud are passed in the ord^r named, and in 2 miles Al-Kama is reached. This is a conspicuous ruined fort on an isolated rock on the right bank commanding the valby for some distance both up and down stream at a bend. It appears to have been deserted owing to natural decay,, the walls having fallen apart. The course of the stream now becomes very winding, tha hills on either side more or less precipitous, culminating on the right bank in the lofty and inaccessible peaks of Jabal Warwa, frequented by ibex. The villages of Hasna and Ma'mrat on the right bank, Dal and Lijma on the left bank are passed and that of Makhran (left bank) is reached two miles below Al-Kama. The Wadi Makhran comes in on the left bank just below 'it. A track—said to be difficult for loaded camels-—leads up this valley and across a pass into the Wadi ul Milah where it joins the Mishwara route just below the well of Uluf-Uluf, Half a mile lower down the river issues from the mountains in a narrow gorge, those on the right bank receding in a westerly direction towards Ad-Dareja. On quitting the gorge, Bashariya, a village with a white mosque is seen on the left bank and after passing the ruined tower of Majar and other small villages of stone hovels with thatched roofs (Dhi Ashar, Fusail, Kaibbib, Gaudun) Musaimir is reached in 5 miles, Musaimir is the residence of the Haushabi Sultan, whosa dwelling is a large 3-storeyed building of mud bricks surrounded by two or three detached groups of huts&gt;43 t , Conbnuing, the nver passes through a defile a mile below .iabai Mana, with its perpendicular precipices conspicuous on the left bank, and again traverses a plain between banks of sixty feet or more. Four miles more and the Warezan-a perennial stream with a flow about half that of the Tiban—comes in on the right bank opposite the village of Habil Maswaida and a mile further on tne Akkan, reduced in the dry season to a few chains of brackish pools, also on the right bank. The spur of Dar Akkan opposite the tower of that name is just below the junction on the right bank. It is a good tactical position commanding as it does the junction of the Warezan and the Akkan with the Tiban and was occupied by a British and Native detachment in the early part oi 1903, but was abandoned on account of its unhealthi- ness. The gan:es of hills, higher on the right bank than the left, now close in again and continue to within about 2 miles of u j Dakim, the village of Jol Madram (left bank) being passed on the way. At Nubat Dakim the hilly region is quitted lor good, a barren plain is traversed and in 6 miles the village (mud walled) of Al-Anad is reached. This is the first village 1 f fk 0f Lahe i' s territory, and just beneath it the valley o tne Jjilih water-course almost unites with the Tiban. Two miles further on is the large village of Shakka marking the commencement of the highly cultivated district cf Lahej and a WfiT . 18 Zaida. These two last villages are both on the ™ ii i are Slmilar in chaiac ter, built of mud bricks and walled as protection against the robbers of the Subaihi tribe. Zaida th0 COurso of fcho Tibrjn div idos into two branches : r ,,' or eas torn one being called the Wadi-us-Saghir, the' nf g T a T 0r - w 0rn ? r - e ' 4110 Wadi-ul-Kabir, the main district rlnr' a ween them. The loft branch is usually dry except during a flood and gradually dies away. The right branch t , , 1 ie stream, but its waters are eventually absorbed f/ 10 cultivation. Between the district of Lahej and the sea aere is a barren tract of land. It is said that the waters of the liban occasionally, although rarely, reach tho sea after abnor- niaj tloods m the rainy season. Although the stream is perennial, short waterless stretches of river bed will be met with during the greater part of the year between Bashanya and Musaimir. This is owing to the entire o ume o watur which in the dry soason is not very consider- ^ ie )(]ng led off into the cultivation and returned again lower47 down. During Febmr.ry (1904) a stretch of about 500 yards immodir.tely bolow Musamir rt-mained dry. On the 3rd of February a streteh of nearly a mile below Bashariya was dry. Two days later water was observed to bo running in this stretch, but a similar portion of river-bed somewhat lower down was observed to be dry. This of course was due to the manipula tion of the stream by the inhabitants in acoordp»nco with recog nized water-rights. On thq 3rd of February the water in the gorge above Bashariya was running in a single rivulet 6 feet broad with an average depth of 4 inches, but in the rainy season the normal size of the stream when not swollen by floods or fresh ets would be about 15 to 20 feet broad with a depth of one foot. From Rahwat-ul-'Abdalla downwards cultivation—except in the gorges—is general. The fields are perforce narrow and are to be seen so. Cultivation exists in the bed of the stream as dis tinguished from the plain traversed by it, there being no moans for raising the water up the high banks. (Fields on the plain would furnish rain crops only.) This is the case as far as Shakka. The Musaimir plain has a hard stony surface, the banks of the river being composed of stones and boulders. The same applies to the plain between Nubat and Al-Anad. From Shakka onwards the banks are much lower and are of semi-hardened sand or alluvial soil perpendicular in places, channelled and liable to cave in in the rainy season. River pollution is much greater above Musaimir than below it. In the Dakkam country are several marshy tracts which drain to the river. These are impregnated with mineral salts and largely composed of decaying p8 &amp;t' CO nd vegetable matter. The fields, too, as far as the Wadi Tusan, are heavily manured with goats' dung. The water is turgid and not very palatable. Diarr hoea is prevalent among the natives and must be guarded against. Bolow the Tusan the soil of the fields is richer and less in need of artificial manure : towards Musaimir the matter in suspension decreases, the current gets slower and allows more time for impurities to settle. But water taken from the river for drinking purposes should always be boiled so as to throw down salts and destroy eggs of parasites, which are liable to be met with at places, where cattle drink. During the rainy season there is usually much mud in suspension and filtering should be resorted to. * Malaria is prevalent along the course of the river./ 48 ' Wo.rezan and tributarie Tho Warozan is a perennial stream the main branch of which rises near J. Sabar. At the point where it enters Amid territory, near J. Tinsam, it is joined by tho Sailat Sudan which has' its source under Naqil Maharras in Soban. Daring the dry sea son, the Warezan is some J foot deep and 10 yards wide, and flows at the rate of 3 miles per hour. Alter rain, its dep'th is from 1' to 1' 6', and the width of tho stream proportionately increased. Tho bed is some 50 yards wide near the border. The natives consider the water unhealthy, but those, whose villages are close, drink it freely. It is liable to sudden floods. Some dozen small villages are scattered, and strips of cultivation extend, along either bank from Kuddash and Azzan down to the W. Ziyak, where the river-bed is fairly open, but from tho Ziyak down it flows between higher banks, where there are neither vil lages nor cultivation. Quicksands are reported near its junc tion with the W. Fakir. W. Z The Wadi Ziyak rises to the north, below J. Jar ban, and for the greater part of its course contains no water. However, just above Kafuf, near J. Thamaran, a small stream rises and flows some 5 feet wide and J foot deep for about mile, where it is diverted and loses itself in cultivation. The water is excellent in quality, but care should be taken in watering animals on account of the presence of leeches. The Ziyak contains several small villages, and the land on either side is cultivated in places for a width of several hundred yards, a large proportion of the fields, however, being owned by the Saiyids of the neighbouring shrine of Shabwa and not by the Amin. The left bank is precipitous in the lower reach. Wadls KarJcahan Although not actually withiq Amiri territory, it is as well to mention here, the Wadis Karkahan and Rida, which rising to the north, near the foot of the Am Amma range, unite just to the east of the ruined tower of Muhammad Nasir Muqbil, north of Kafuf, and join the Warezan a mile below the junction of the49 Ziyak. TI10 Rida contains a stream of excGllotit water flowing for about half mile till it is diverted, to irrigate cultivation, ori* ginating^in a spring which fills a pool some 20 ya^dsin diameter and 2' 3' deep. A small stream of good water rises in the Wadi Karkahan, just above its junction with the Rida, and flows for about ^ mile, breaking forth twice before the Wadi, under the name of the Wadi-ul-Milah, reaches the Warezan. Th3 level uplands, between the Ziyak and the Rida nullahs, afford an excellent camping ground with water sufficient for several tnousand men. Water would be less plentiful about April, but these nullahs are s?*id never to run dry, Wddl Halchab* The Wadi Hakkab^ to the south of the steep slopes of J. Thamaran, which joins the Warezan about a mile above the confluence of the Ziyak, is well wooded and bordered in places by cultivated fields. It contains no running water. There are several small villages which obtain their water from shallow springs and wells in their vicinity. Wddi Mijza. The Wadi Mijza, a dry nullah formed by the junction of the Wadis Kuruf and Ulub, joins the Warezan from the south. Tho village of Ulub with well is ina fertile little valley, well cul tivated. Several other dry nullahs drain into the Warezan on either side. Wddl AleJcan and Tributaries. There is, as a rule, no running water in the Akkan or tribu taries during tho dry season. Tho Akkan, 40 to 50 yards wide, is formed by tho junction of tho Wadi Natid, rising at the foot of the Yusufiym hills near Al-Hajr in Turkish territory, and the Wad! Hidaba, coming from the foot of tho Naqil Wuzif between the Kubati and Yusufi hills. Wddl Hidaha* The portion of the Wadi Hidaba above Minjara, near th© Yusufiyin border, contains some ten small villages with cultivat ed land on either bank and in the vicinity, C387GSB H50 The water-supply, from two indifferent wells, is not more than sufficient for the population (Bir Minjara, bad water, Bir 'Aii and Bir Hanesk). Above the village of Al-Ashar, the Wadi Hidaba enters a precipitous defile between the mountains of the Kubati and Yusufi groups, with here and there a narrow strip of cultivation on either side. About a mile above the village is a third well (Bir Dariba) used by some six of the villages. Depth in January 5'; refills after one hour's rest. Forty-two feet to water. A little beyond this well, the Wddl takes a westerly turn, and is joined from the south-east by the Wadi Fan (Juhaili). A mile or so further up occurs the boundary between the Amiri and the Kubati. There is a good spring of water 2| miles above Bir Dariba, in Wadi Makar in Kubati territory, and another smaller one in Juhaili near the junction of Wadi Fari. The natives say that after a good year's rain, there is flowing water during the dry season in Wadi Hidaba from near the Kubati boundary to the village of Al-Ashar, and after heavy rain an impassable torrent comes down. The Wadi Hidaba joins the Wadi Natid about a mile below the Minjara tower. Wddl Natid. The Wadi Natid which is the main branch of the Akkan, maintains an average width of 50 yards, the banks wooded with tamarisk and ' rak ' (pileu). The level spaces on either bank, from i to J mile wide, are cultivated from the Turkish border atove the village of Ta'bra, down to the village of Hawaimi. It comtains four small villages. There is a good well, Bir Adlan, in the river-bed, 5 feet of water (January) and a total depth of 50 feet, just above the junction of the Wadi Faki, a mile above Hawaimi, from the north-east. The upper part of this Wadi (Al-Faki) is wooded, with steep and precipitous banks. One and a half miles from its mouth is an indifferent well and thence down it widens out to about half mile of cultivated ground on the right bank. There are three small villages on low hills. Hawaimi Springs. The most reliable and abundant water-supply in this portion of the Amiri country consists of a group of springs on either bank of the Wadi Natid in the neighbourhood of Hawaimi. The most plentiful are at Hawaimi itself, on the left bank. From an undulating stretch of turf, a few acres in extent, several springs furnish a practically inexhaustible supply of water, which,51 on issuing from the ground, is so hot that the fingers can only be plunged in hastily. Here and there are small pools of cool water. The water, when hot, has a sulphurous smell and leaves a deposit of saltpetre on the grass, which the natives use in mak ing powder, but when allowed to cool it is excellent drinking water without any taste. Hathowa. —Half a mile up the nullah from Hawaimi, a path on the right bank, leads over a low rocky pass for f mile to another hot spring, called Umm Hathowa. A fast running rill of water fills a basin some 5 yards in diameter and 2 feet deep. The water is cool when it reaches the basin. Karrash. —On the right bank of the W. Natid on the regulor caravan track, 1J miles from Hawaimi are the springs of Kar» rash. Several basins are filled by numerous springs. The water is cool. No force of much over 200 men would find water sufficient for men and animals in this part of the 'Amiri country without having recourse to these springs. Level uplands with space available for camping a large force exist near Karrash within easy reach of all the above springs. All other Wddls in Amiri territory are torrent beds which are either dry except in time of sudden flood or have only a few small springs. The largest of these are :— The watercourse which rises west of Jabal Harir and runs south under the names of the Sailat-un-Nauba, Sailat-ud- Dabab, and the Sailat-ur-Rabwa to the Suhaib valley at Jimil. There is a good ' ghail '&gt; or running stream in the part of this watercourse, three miles above Sulaik. The Sailat Hardaba, the sources of which are in the gorges of Al Khuraiba and Al-Hakl immediately east of Dhala, and which also runs south to the Suhaib valley at Jimil. There are good springs at Ghail Hardaba, 16 miles down the valley from Dhala. The Wddl Tabaghain, which is formed by the junction of the channels which, taking their rise high up on Jahaf, descend south draining the Azraki, Mafari, and Humaidi country, and runs west down a fine gorge to the Tiban. There is a small h252 perennial stream at intervals in its course, viz., in the Ban-an- Nishfi gorge south-west of Dhala ? in the Azraki country just above Ad-Dakka, and in the Ahmad! country below the Al- Madhiq gorge. In the Azraki country the watercourse is known as the Wadi-ur-Rona. The Wddl Mashwara, which takes its rise on Jabal Mashwara? and runs due south in a deep rocky gorge, becoming theWadi- ul-Milah when it enters Haushabi territory. The Wadl Tern which drains the southern slopes of the Hal- min mountains, and the north-eastern slopes of the Radfan Moun tains and runs east in a wide open valley to the Wadi Bana. The Sailat Masra which rises high up in the Radfan hills, and runs north-west through the Kotaibi country to Naubat-ul- Qaryati at the northern foot of the hills, then turns south to join the Sailat Umm Suhabiya, near Jimil. The lower part of the valley is half a mile to a mile wide, cultivated up to the foot of the kills on either side. The watercourse is dry and sandy. Higher up the valley narrows and there is a running stream. The Sailat Bujair which has its source among the Al-Bakri hills of the Radfan range and runs west to join the Sailat Masra at Naubat-Ul-Qaryati. There are two main branches, in the more northerly of which, a running stream {ghail) takes its rise. This stream runs about 15 feet wide, and 1 foot deep, till it loses itself at Naubat-ul-Qaryati, five miles from its source. The lower part of the valley is a narrow gorge between rocky hills. Near the village of Sum'an the gorge opens, and there is cultivation ? though the valley is still narrow. Nazi'a. The Nazi'a flows in a natural channel from the Bana near Al- Masna', a little below Al-Hasan. Artificial irrigation carries its water over the cultivated lands between the Bana and Hasan, Band. The Band rises in tSae Yafa'i country among the hills to the north of Ibb. Sweeping round to the north of the Marais range, it enters the British Protectorate between the district of Rub'atain, and the Shaibi country, running east, to the south of Dabiani, till at its junction with the Sailat Sih its course southwards begins.53 It runs continuously from May to October and freshets occur frequently which reach the sea. It Was crossed in September 1903 (the rainy season) by a British force, between Shaibi and Rub'atain. The altitude of the river bed at this point is 4,200 feet, the slopes above the banks being very steep and precipi tous, and the summits of the highest mountains rising to about 8,000 feet. The stream was 20 to 25 yards wide with a current of three miles per hour and a depth of 2 feet to 2| feet. The banks were about 3 feet above water-level with a varying width on either side of level ground up to a maximum of 50 yards, covered with rushes and undergrowth, and in places, a fair number of large trees. In the dry season the depth does not probably exceed 1J feet, but after heavy and continuous rain, the stream becomes an impassable and rushing torrent, some 10 feet in depth. On its course through the Upper Yafa'i and Halmin countries, the Bana flows between high mountains, and cultivation occurs in its valley in parts. Then, skirting the Kadfan mountains, it enters the Habil Jabr plain. The valley here opens out, and the stream, making a bold curve eastwards and then southwards, emerges from the hills into the plain. Below the Habil Jabr plain, the Bana again passes through the mountainous tract between the hills of the Dairi tribe (the Radfan system), and the mountains of the Lower Yafa'i till it emerges at the village of A1 Masna', whence it flows southwards over the alluvial plain to the sea. The Abyan or low-lying tract between the rivers Hasan and Bana is well irrigated and cultivated, the matter of the water-rights forming a ground of standing feud between the Fadhli, and Lower Yafa'i tribes. It is only at times of flood, that the water reaches the sea. The quality of the water seems to be good for drinking. Mrs. Bent describes the Bana bed below Khanfar in the Lower Yafa'i country, as so thickly overhung with trees that their branches had to be lopped off to enable the party to pass, and also mentions the reported existence of quick sands in this neighbourhood. The Bana has no perennial tributaries of any importance. There are quicksands in some parts of the Wddl. Hasan, The Hasan rises in the Yafa'i country. It is a broad river, but never unfordable and its waters do not reach the sea more than a dozen times a year. It enters Fadhli territory from54 the north-east and traverses the valley of the Yeramis be tween the I'adhli maritime range^ and the mountains of the Lower Yafa'i. It receives the drainage east and south of Al J^ara (the capital of the Lower Ya'fai country) and also a consider able share of the drairiage of the country inhabited by the Markashi. Its principal tributaries, flowing from the Lower Yafa'i country, are the Wadis Silib, S^rrar, Taiba'a and Hatat. According to information received by . Mr. Tate, who con ducted a survey of a portion of the Lower Yafa'i country in 1893, the three first join the Hasan in the vicinity of the village of Na'b, and are said to contain water throughout their course- He describes the valley of the Wa:li Silib as fairly open, but that of the other streams draining the Lower Ya'a'i as narrow trough like valleys. The Wadi Hatat rises under the Naqil Maskaba pass, and joins the Hasan about 12 to 14 miles north-east of Al Husn. In the upper part of its CDurse, water is frequently met with issuing from springs in the river bed ; trees, from which the stream takes its name, and of which the leaves are poisonous, line the banks. Aden. British territory was formerly limited to the peninsula of Aden proper, extending to Khor Maksar, two miles north of the defensive work across the isthmus. In 1868 the island of Sira and the peninsula of Jabal Ihsan or Little Aden, were acquired by purchase from the Sultan of Lahej. In 1882 a further small tract of territory was acquired by purchase, ex tending to just beyond the village of 'Imad on the north and to Shaikh Othman on the north-west. The inhabited peninsula is an irregular oval 15 miles in cir cumference, connected with the continent by a neck of land 1,350 yards broad. It consists of a crater walled round by pre cipices, the highest peak being 1,775 feet above sea level. Bugged spurs radiate towards the sea. To the west of these hills lies Aden harbour. Aden town and part of the military cantonment lie in the crater, the commercial centre is at Tawahi facing the harbour, while on Steamer Point at the harbour mouth are the two forts, Morbut and Tarshyne, and the rest of the cantonment. The total area of British territory is 75 square miles, of which the peninsula and isthmus (Aden proper) contain 21 square55 miles, Shaikh Othman, 'Imad, and Hiswa, 39, and Little Aden 15. Aden is a healthy station for troops, British and Indian, but the climate is very enervating. The absence of vegetation and the purity of the drinking water constitute efficient safe guards against many maladies common to tropical countries but on first arrival troops are subject to sandfly fever. The most trying season of the year are the months of May and June, and from the beginning of September till the middle of October Heat apoplexy occurs during these months. During July and August the monsoon winds alleviate the heat. From November till March the weather is pleasant, but chills are common as a result of exposure to the north-east wind after exercise. The settlement is exceptionally free from diseases and epidemics. The average rainfall is from 2J to 4 inches in the year. Occasional outbreaks occur of horse sickness, w^hich is suppos ed to be imported from the African coast. Perim, The island of Perim lies in the narrowest part of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, only one and a half miles from the Arabian coast and nine miles from the shores of Africa. It is 3^ miles long by wide with an area of 5 square miles, and its highest point near the south-eastern end is 214 feet above sea-level. The formation is entirely volcanic with coral and sand in the valleys and on the outskirts. There is no water and little vegetation. Soqotra. The island lies about 150 miles east of Cape Gardafui and is 72 miles long, by 22 miles broad. On the southern side the shore preserves nearly an unbroken line, but, on the northern and western sides, it is broken into a succession of small bays, none of which are safe at all times of the year. On the south side are the Nauhad plains, the largest of which extends nearly the whole length of the island and is for miles covered with dunes of drift sand. The southern side, though considerably less fertile than the northern, is towards Ras Romi near the eastern end, tolerably productive ; but, westwards, it is as arid and barren as the we&amp;t part of Arabia56 The interior may be described as a tableland 700 to 1,900 feet high with rugged peaks rising nearly 5,000 feet above' sea level. It is intersected by broad and fertile valleys and descends to the coast in precipitous slopes and cliffs. Plains, averaging from two to four miles in width, separate the tableland from the coast and are dotted with bushes and palms. There are many perennial streams in the centre of the island, but only a few reach the coast. The rivers on the north side of the island only fill their beds during the latter part of the south-west monsoon, and then so copiously, and with such rapidity, that they are said not to be fordable for camels, even at a considerable distance from the sea. There are only three places on the island that can be designat ed as towns. These are Tamridah, Kadhup and Kallansiya. Tamridah is the capital and stands in a plain four miles broad formed by a semi-circle of hills closing to a narrow valley towards the south. Tamridah is a clean and picturesque village built among palms and covering about five acres of ground. Some of the houses are built of white cbral, while others are of rubble, and all have flat roofs surrounded by a parapet. Each house has its ,own garden fenced round with branches of the date- palm, where melons, peas and tobacco are grown. The Sultan's palace is a fort with a frontage and depth of about forty yards, and loopholed walls some twenty feet high. The water-supply is obtained from a perennial stream which runs close by. Climate*—The climate is remarkably cool and temperate. The mean temperature of Tamridah amounts to about 70° in January and 86° in June. There are two wet seasons on the island, one from June to August, and the other from November to January. February to May are the finest months on the north coast. The low-lying country round Tamridah is very malarious and troops should be camped on the highlands south of the town, but, beyond this, there is very little disease prevalent on the island. Tribal Areas. ^ Ah doll. The district inhabited by the 'Abdali tribe, which has been known from very early times as Lahej, is bounded on the west by a line starting from a boundary pillar situated about a mile from the sea near the Hiswa, on the northern shore of the Aden har-X e9 57 bour.

Southwards, it falls away in a series of broken mountains and hills to the Aden littoral. The above mentioned tract consists mainly of rugged moun tains of igneous rock, with here and there broad cultivated valleys. The Amir of Dhala's territory is bounded on the north by a line which leaves the WadiBana at the foot of a prominent hill, Haidh Ithri, runs west over the crest of this hill and down to the valley of the Sailat Bakain, across it, and up Haidh Sala a big spur of Jabal Harir, divides the village of Adina on the south from Marat on the north, and reaches the summit of Jabal Harir just north of the village of Al-Fokaha, descends by the Naqil Haban spur, passes just north of the Shairi vil lage of Khubaidat and then runs down the southern branch of the Wadi-ul-Haslab to near the village of Sarara, then turns, north, over the peak of Jabal Akram, and crosses the valley north' of that hill between the Amiri village of Dar-ul-Han- bali and the Mufla'u village of Khalla, then north-west among the foothills of the Shaibi range near the Amid village of Al-Kurain to a conspicuous red rock which marks the junction of the lands of Habil-ul-Jilb (Shaibi), Al-Kurain and Al-Ukla. The line then goes north up a steep spur to a point on the Marais border known as Ras Naqil Adana. From this point westwards the Amir's border is the frontier between the British protectorate and Turkish territory. The line goes west a,cross the Naqil Suqda to Nijd Ma'wad at the head of the Wadi Keshan, then south to the summit of the hill called Jabal Barkan; west along the southern slopes of a rid'e to its western point, known as Jabal Jerad, thence to Nijd Aslum | a mile south of Ka'taba; crosses the Sailat Ka'- taba two miles below the town, then south-west to Nijd-un- Nus, turns due west across Habil Bajah and the Sailat Human to the tomb of Wall 'Umr Isma'Il. thence goes south-west, cross ing the Wadi Jimri just above kule'a-us-Sufla, to high ground called Habil Hawar; thence it runs south across the Wadi Tiban and up to a high north-eastern shoulder of Jabal Hesha known as Jabal Sarir.59 The districts which border on the Amir of Dhala's territory along the above line are as follows:—From the Wad! Bana to the Sailat Bakain, the Shaibi districts of the Ab-Musallami and the As-Siel; thence across Jabal Harlr and across Jabal- Akram to the Shaibi foothills is a district belonging to the Mc- flahi section of the Yafa'i, the central village of which is Khalla. Thence to near Al-Ukla, the small district of Habil-ul- Jilb, belonging to the As-Siel section of the Shaibi. Thence to near Ka'taba, the Turkish district of Marais. -The lands of Ka taba itself up to the main Sailat Ka'taba water-course : thence to the Sailat-ul-Jimri, the district of Yubj; thence up to Jabal Hesha, the distiiet of Haiki. The western border of the Amir of Dhala's territory also marks the frontier of the British Protectorate. The line runs south from Jabal San'r, generally parallel to the course of the Wadi Tiban and a mile or two west of it, travers ing the steep slopes of Jabal Hesha: first to the high point J. Mansura west of the Dakkam village of Ukaib, then across a valley to another point J. Fanana ; across the valley of the Wadi Hafasa, and up to the peak of Jabal Rima which marks the Ah- mac.i border ; then down to the Wadi Haura which it crosses just above the Ahmadi village of Haura, then south over a spur of J. Attaba, and across the Wadi Mukhailan and the Wadi Tusan just above their junction; then up to a point, Lakmat-ush-Shijfa, and along the crest line of the range from which the Wadi Kurim and the Wadi Hilhal drain east to the Tiban, then up a broken ridge by J. Mimtar until it meets the Haushabi border at a peak called Ha id Hasun on the range which connects Jabel Warwa with Jabal Am Amma. The districts which border on the Amir of Dhala's territory trVf ^ 1S line are ' from fche Haikf district down to the Wadi Mukhailan Jabal Hesha ; thence to the Naqil Hilhal, Amara ; and from the Naqil Hilhal to the Haushabi border. Humar. Th e Amir of Dhala's territory is bounded on the north by a line which, from Haidh Hasun, runs east for a short distance along the mam range, then follows to the spur forming the southern water- shed of Wadi Hilhal, crosses the Wadi Tiban at the junction to i s lett bank tributary, the Wadi Shan, ascends and follows south wards the crest of the mountains above the left bank of the Tiban so as to exclude the Haushabi villages and lands of A1 Kama and •Lijma, and meets the Wadi Tiban again at the junction of the Wadi60 Makhran; leaves the Wadi Tiban again, following eastwards the crest of the hills forming the southern watershed of the WacE Makhran to the Kalaban peak, thence along the col, which is cros sed by the pass (Naqil Hesha) at the head of the Wad! Bilih, then south-east along the southern watershed of the Sailat Kharjan and down a spur to a point called Safa Atla on the right bank of the Wadi-ul- Milah; thence north across the Wadi-ul-Milah up to the peak of Jabal Barrash and follows the crest line 3^ miles further north, then follows round the head of a tributary of the Sailat-umm Suhaibiya and runs south-east down to the ridge above the right bank of the Sailat Tuwana, then turns east across the Sailat-umm- Suhaibiya just leaving the villages of Al-Hamra and At-Tamair to the south. The line now turns south ascending a north-eastern spur of the Radfan mountains called Haidh Musa, to a peak call ed Jabal Fallaha, then turns east along the watershed which con nects Jabal Fallaha with Jabal-ul-Huria, the highest peak of the Radfan mountains. From Jabal-ul-Huria, it runs down east or north-east ta the Wadi Bana. The districts which border on the Amir of Dhala 7 s territory along this line are as follows:— From Haidh Hasun on the west to Safa Atla on the bank of the Wadi-ul-Milah, the country of the Haushabi. From Safa Atla round to Jabal Fallaha the country of the 'Alawi. From Jabal Fallaha to the Wad! Bana, the Dhanbari and Dairl districts of the Radfan mountains, both of which tribes are supposed to acknowledge the supremacy of the Haushabi Sultan. On the east the Wadi Bana forms the boundary of the Amir of Dhala's territory dividing it from the Yafa country on the left bank The country comprised within the above limits is about 750 square miles in extent. Almost the entire country consists of mountains of a remark ably abrupt and rugged description. On the east is the continuous range formed by the Jabal Harlr and Jabal Halmin. In the centre are the Shain hills, and the rugg ed promontory, which just south from the head of the Dhala valley cuiminates in the remarkable plateau of Adh-Dhubayyat, and falls away, in a series of rocky foothills to the Suhaib valley. The north -western part is occupied by the great mountain mass of61 Jabal Jahaf, with its far-reaching spurs and offshoots. The whole of the south-western partis an intricate mass of rugged mountains conspicuous among which are the peaks of Jabal Mashwara and Jabal-un-Nad in the north, and Jabal Hakla, Jabal Hadwa, Haid- ul-Harfa and others, in the south. The south-eastern comer is occupied by the massive and rocky northern spurs of the Radfan range. Rivers. The only rivers are the Wadi Bana and the Wadi Tiban. The Wddl Band, which rises far to th^ north-west among the hills north of Ibb, sweeps round the north of the Al-Aud, Marais, and Shaibi countries and enters the territory of the Amir at its north-eastern corner. Thence it forms its eastern boundary until it passes out of Anuri territory again at the junction of the 'Abdalla and Dairi borders on the east of the Radfan Mountains. It runs in a deep valley between big hills, but there are broad cultivated spaces on its banks in parts. The river runs from 2 to 3 feet deep in the dry season. The Wddl Tiban which rises between Ibb and Jibla enters Am- iii territory in the lowlying Dakkam country north-west of Jabal Jahaf. It then turns south and flows near the western border down a narrow gorge between Jabal Jahaf and Jabal Hesha. Through the Ahmad! country its valley is comparatively open, as much as a quarter of a mile wide in places, with stretches of cul tivation at intervals along it&amp; banks. The Wadi Tiban runs about a foot deep y and 10 to 15 yards wide in the dry season. It leaves Ami i territory at the Haushabi border, about 25 miles south of the point where it entered it. Both the Wadi Bana and the Wadr Tiban are frequently enclosed by narrow gorges and both are liable to sudden floods. All other Wadis in AmTri territory are torrent beds,, which are either dry, except in time of sudden flood, or have only a few small springs. Dhdla. (Lat. 13° 42' north; Long. 44^43' east; Elevation, 4,900 feet.) The town of Dhala with the residence of the Amir stands at tha head of an open high-lying valley, which falls away gent ly to the norths draining to the Ssjlat Kc/tabja, and so to tho63 fiat-topped ridge of Jabal Harir which bounds the view to the oast. Enclosed in this amphitheatre of mountains lies the Dhala plateau. Its eastern part is broken by the rocky ridges of the Shairi country which rise to a high peak at their southern end, while- north of them Jabal Akram of the Muflahi (Yafa) stands con spicuous. Immediately north-east of Dhala town is a mass of rocky hills, which hide from view the open plain at the head of the Khuraiba pass. Just beyond these hills to the north stands the. commanding isolated hill Jabal Shahad, which overlooks all routes across the plateau from Dhala, and from tiie Khu raiba pass, and which was fortified and occupied by the Turks throughout 1902. In the plain that lies stretched below, as one looks north from Jabal Dili Bait, the village of Al-Kabar, on a conical hill, is a central object a mile distant. Half a mile further north is the shrine of Wall Shafi, which stands at the eastern foot of the Kharba ridge ; this is a narrow sharp crested ridge which rises 150 to 200 feet above the plain, and lies across it east and west about |-mile in length. Near its western end, not far from the foot of Jabal Jahaf* is another abrupt rocky hill on which stands the village of Ar-Rubat. Looking past the eastern side of Al-Kabar, and about a mile beyond it Al-Jalila is seen, on a low ridge which runs north west from Jabal Shahad. A mile and a half north of Al-Jalila another isolated hill, Jabal-us-Sauda, similar in appearance to Jabal Shahad, rises from the middle of the plain. Ka'taba is visible on a clear day, the direction being over Wadi Shafi and the low hills near Sirafi. Over the western shoulder of Jabal-us^Sauda three towers on a ridge mark the posi tion of Lakmat-ush-Sh'ub, and still further Al-Ukla may be discerned at the foot of the Marais hills. Over the eastern shoulder of Jabal Shahad, Al-Husain, where a weekly Tuesday market is held, may be seen on a spur which runs west from Jabal Akram.64 DJidla town. —Tho residence of the Amir is oniwi r&gt;- , Haidh.

Its area is estimated at 1,600 square miles. The Lower Aulaki territory is bounded on the north by Upper 'Aulaki—a hill called Hajar-ur-Rayyan defining the limit. On the south it extends along the coast between the Fadhli and Dhuyaibi tribes; but the port of 'Irka belongs to an independent Shaikh of the Badas family. The area is not less than 1,800 square miles. Baidd, The Baida territory is bounded on the north by Baihan- ul-Kasab, on the west by the Upper Yafa'i country, on the south by Al-Marakisha, and on the east by the 'Aulakl. It is an elevated plateau sloping gradually to the lower-lying country of Baihan-ud-Uaula to the north, and the 'Aulaki country east and south. The soil is of a sandy nature and fertile. Baihan-ul-Kasdb. Baihan-ul-Kasab is an independent country bounded on the north by the country of Harib, on the west by Jerabat, a district of Karn, on the east by a desert tract called Bal Harith, and on the south by Al-Malajim and Baihan- -ud-Daula, which is under Baida. The capital, is Suq-uI-Kasab, on the Wad! Baihan. The houses are built of mud bricks, The territory occupied by the Fadhli tribe extends from the eastern boundary of British limits near 'Tmad to the western boundary of the 'Aulaki tribe at Maqatin. The northern boundary is conterminous with those of the 'Abdali, Haushabi, Yafa'i, and 'Aulaki tribes. The country is divided into two large districts, the lands of Abyan, and the highlands of the north-east, Haushabi. The territory inhabited by the Haushabi tribe lies some 30 to 40 miles to the north of Aden and is roughly about 600 squaro miles in extent. The country consists of a long and narrow strip, its greatest length being from Harur on the east to beyond 387GSB • ■ ■ ' -•66 Kuddash on the west. The whole of the western part is moun- tainous the mountains being^of a particularly bleak and bar ren character with little vegetation and rugged sides difficult of ascent. In this portion, cultivation is almost entirely carried on in the valleys of the Tiban, Warezan and various stretches of 'HabiP or stone-covered plain, occur frequent ly between the hills, but these are useless for purposes of cul tivation. The eastern part is with the exception of some cul tivation near Harur and Ar-Raha, sandy desert. The southern boundary runs from Harur to Nubat Dakim, whence it follows the crest-line of the range of hills running parallel to the right bank of the Tiban to a little below the junction of the WadI Akkan, from which it passes in a south westerly direction, south of Minjara and Hidaba and skirting the north of the Juhaili hills to J. Muharrika. From Harur fi , xfuhat Dakim the border marches with the 'Abdali; thence to j Muharrika with to Subaihi. From J. Muharrika it crosses the Wadi Hidaba just below the Kubatl village of Suq -ur-Rabu, then the Wadi Natid at Dar Nasir HarbC whence it follows in a general north-west direction the crest-line of the low hills (J. Ghefan, Humala and Rakabat Tinsam) overlooking the low-lying Yusuflyin and Badu countries. From Tinsam it follows a general north east direction crossing the Habil 'Arabi just to the south of the village of Nabu, and the Am Amma range at J. Basaisa, on the north side of which Ahmadi territory is met. This portion is the boundary with the Turkish Sanjak of Ta'izz, the conterminous districts being KubatI, Yusufi, Badu and Humar. The boundary is shewn in detail on the map. Hence the Haushabi boundary with the Ahmadi runs east, north of J. Warwa, to the junction of the Wadi Shan with the Tiban whence it turns south, on the left bank of the Tiban to the Wadi Makhran, the villages and lands of Lijma and Ai Kam'a, being included on the Haushabi side. The line then runs east along the southern watershed of the Wadi Makh ran to J. Kalaban, and along the col crossed by the Naqil Hesha pass at the head of the Wadi Bilih; then south-east along the southern watershed of the Sailat Kharjan and down a spur to a point called Saf a Atla, where the boundary with the Amiri ends. The line then passes south to Al-Milah bordering on tlie *Alawl and south-east, by Dar-ul-Ashraf, Bir Shakfa and/pN 67 Bir-al-Jiyin, to Harur, the Dhanbari (Radfan tribe nominally under Haushabi influence) being to the north. The villages in the Haushabi country are as a rule small and badly built, consisting of a tower or two each, and a clus ter of little stone hovels. The largest villages are Harur with about 50 houses and Ar-Raha, a cluster of small villages. The Sultan himself lives at Musaimir in a large tower of stone in mud, some 75 feet square and 40 feet high. With the excep tion of one other tower, the only habitation is a cluster of reed huts where his soldiers and slaves lives. The tower is situated on an eminence some 200 feet above the left bank of the Tiban. The locality is most unhealthy. There are springs of water in the Wadi Jiref, about a mile above its point of junction with the left bank of the Tiban below Musaimir, yielding an abundant supply of good drinking water. The tribe is estimated to number 7,000 souls, Kaaitu The country in possession of the Ka'aiti lies on the north coast and includes the ports of Shehr and Mukalla. Behind the coast district are bare downs, known as 'Jol', that rise to over 6,000 feet. Mukalla is the capital Kasddu The country occupied by this tribe is the western region of the Ka'aiti territory, having been conquered by the Ka'aiti tribe in 1881. On the west are the Wahid! and the Beduin tribes of Al-Bahaish and ' Akabira: on the north are the Kathiri; on the east, the 'Akabira, Bani Hasan and Ahl-ul-Haik; while the southern boundary is the Arabian Sea. The country is intersected by chains of hills. The whole area is estimated at about 375 square miles. Kathlrl. The country inhabited by this tribe was formerly of vast ex tent, extending from the 'Aulaki on the west to the Mahri tribe on the east, and including the sea ports of Mukalla and Shehr. Civil wars led to interference by the Yafa'i, and much territory has come under the rules of the Kasadi and Ka'aiti within the last half century. The Katbiri now possess no j^orfc at all. The capital is Tsriait k20 Mahrl. The Mahri territory extends along the coast from near Masna' to Damkut. Inland the country is believed to consist of sandy steppes, but its boundaries are unknown, Subaihl, This large tribe inhabits the country bordering on the sea from Bab-el-Mandeb to Ras 'Imran and bounded on the north by the Maktaii, Sharjabi, Athwari, and other tribes under Turkish Suzerainty. Although covering a large area, it is but sparsely inhabited, the greater portion, either consisting of sandy wastes with an occasional well and a little cultivation, or of bleak and rocky low hills covered with thin thorn scrub and intersected by a network of ravines, as in the north-east corner, water in both cases being scanty and often brackish. There are, however, certain exceptions to this barren and waterless character, and these may be found in proximity to the border of the Turkish tribes. The Turkish districts abutting on the Subaihi, from near the Naqil Madraja to the Wadi Ma'adin, situated on a range of fertile and well-watered mountains rising to altitudes of 6,000 to 7,000 feet, drain southwards to the Subaihi border, which follows the foot hills of the range, by numerous well- marked wddls and it is in, and near, these wddls that almost the only fixed habitations of the Subaihi, and cultivation, are to be found, Wahldl § The territory occupied by the Wahidi is situated on each side of the Wadi Maifa and enclosed on three sides by hills, while on the south is the Arabian Sea. The coast line extends from near Ras-ul-Kalb for about fifty miles to a point west of Ba- lahaf. The area is about 160 square miles, and on the west of the Wahidi country are the Upper 'Aulaki and the Dhuyaibi, and on the north and east the NVman and Buraishi tribes. The territory may be divided into three districts : Habban to the north, Bir 'All on the coast, and 'Izzan in the centre. Upper Yafa (Yafa-s-Sufld). The country of the Yafa'i lies to the north and north-east of Aden, and is divided into two main divisions hitherto known69 officially as the Upper and Lower Yafa respectively, Upper Yafa being to the north and the Lower Yafa to the south. The tribes themselves call the northern division the Yafa-'s- Sufla, or low, and the southern division the Yafa Bani Afif F or Bani Kasid. The boundaries of Yafa-'s-Sufia are on the north-west, the Marais country, and Hajajia and Riyashia in the Turkish district of Rida; on the north, the tribes of Al-Husainia and Malajim under the influence of 'Amm Rasas, on the north-east and east, the territory of 'Amm Rasas; on the west, the terri tory of the Amir of Dhala and the subordinate tribes of the Shairi, Halmia and Al-'Ajud; and on the south, the Yafa Bani Kasid. Yafa-'s-Sufla is a country consisting of high mountains and deep valleys. The principal ranges of mountains are Jabal Shimr lying between the country of the Dhubi and Mausatta clans; Jabals Shamsan, Dhi-Marsua and Zaivi, in the Mausatta territory: and the Jabal-ul-'Urr range forming the border be tween Yafa-'s-Sufla and the Baida country and Jabal-ul-'Ali ^and Jabal Sulaiman in the centre of Yafa. The principal river of the country is the Wadi Bana, which flows in from the north-west, but there are several of its trib utaries and small valleys which have running streams in them; Amongst these are the Wadi Hatib, the Wadi Jahami and the Sailat-us-Sih. Water can be found in nearly all valleys during the months of July, August, and September, the rainy season. The general elevation of Yafa-'s-Sufla is between 4,000 and 7,000 feet above the sea and the climate is equable and generally cool and pleasant. For limits of territories occupied by sub-tribes ; see Chapter III. Lower Yafa. {Yafa Bani Kdsid or Bani Afif). The territory of this tribe is bounded on the north by the Upper Yafa'i, on the south and east by the Fadhli and inde pendent tribes, and on the west by the Amiri and the Haushabi. The country is said to be very mountainous, but well watered, and to abound in fertile valleys.70 Climate and Health, In a country of such varying altitudes as the Aden Hin terland, ranging from the sea level to 8,000 feet, it follows that a general appreciation of the climate is impossible. For purposes of description, the country may be divided into three general classes, the low-lying plain country between the hills and the seashore, the lower valleys and river-beds, and the ele vated plateau and hill country. The plain, of which the majority consists of sandy desort fc or 'Khabt' is, as may be expected, very hot. In the actual neighbourhood of the sea^ the atmosphere is like that of Aden^ moist and steamy, but a very few miles inland, a marked diffe rence is perceptible, the atmosphere being of the typical dry and desert character. The cooler weather in this plain lasts for three or, at the moat, four months, from November till February. Although no actual cold weather is experienced, the climate at this season would offer no obstacle to the operations of troops. The nights are fresh and, even up to the end of May, no really hot nights are experienced. As a rule a gotod breeze blows dur ing the day and night, dying away in the, early morning and evening. The Boundary Commission was working in the # lower country between Jabal Hawab and Shaikh Sa'id till the end of May,, and although it had been found advisable to send away the British troops with the escort and supporting co lumn in April, as several slight cases of sun-stroke had occur red (the troops were in single-fly tents), there were no casual ties either among the British officers, or the native troops. The labours of the survey-party and their escort were arduous* involving day-long exposure to the sun and the continual ascent of hills, but no evil effects resulted. The highest temperature recorded under the single fly of a tent, during the month of May, was 104 deg. Fahr. This tract may in fact be summed up as hot, but healthy^ the only factor for sickness, other than that due to the sun, being the occasional necessity of drink ing brackish water, which after a few days produced diarrhoea and, occasionally, dysentery. From May to September, sand-storms are of frequent occur rence,^ and thunder, accompanied by heavy showers of rain, sometimes all three combined, occur. WMle the Commission was encamped among the low hills at Karaba, at a height of Skbout 2,000 feet, in early May, after several oppressive daya^71 a heavy thunderstorm ^as experienced, with a violent wind which levelled many tents, and torrential rain mingled with hail. The storm lasted for two hours when the river ^beds became rushing and impassable torrents. These characteris tic i do not, however, apply to the lower-lying country under cultivation, such as the Lahej oasis, where the standing crops and irrigation channels, not only rendered the atmosphere more oppressive, but a^so conduce to the k breeding of anopheles mosquitoes, and consequent malaria. The neighbourhood of Lahei, and the Tiban above it, have a bad reputation on this account, and the shortest possible halts, compatible with the necessities of the occasion, should be made. Though somewhat cooler than the low-lying plain-country, the lo^e: hills, and country near the river beds, are responsi ble for nearly all the sickness that occurred among the troops, both native and British, employed in the Hinterland during 1903, and the early part of 1904. That this sickness was most severe, the medical reports show; for beyond the large percentage of deaths and the very large roll of sick, every regiment or corps, whether British or native, which passed a month or so in these parts, was reported unfit for further active service on their return to Aden. The fore going remarks apply particularly to the valley of the Tiban, at certain points of which, political and military requirements necessitated the presence of troops; at Dar Akkan and at Mu- saimir, for some months each, and at Nubat Dakim practically continuously. The first named place may be described as a death-trap. Malaria also occurred among troops stationed near Har- daba and at Sulaik in the Sailat Hardaba as well as among those employed in the Kotaibi expedition, where camping near the river bed^ was a necessity, but to a less extent. Mos quitoes are common in all these parts. We know little about the Bana; the uppex Bana at any rate does not bear a malarious reputation, but the lower reaches are^ no doubt, unhealthy. With regard to the Yeramis valley, Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Bent, who passed up it in 1897, were brought back to Aden quite prostrated by malaria, and lay ill in hospital for several weeks. Mr. Bent's death, immediately on returning to Eng* land, may be attributed to this illness. The malaria, especially in the Tiban valley, is of a serious and sometimes a malignant72 kind. At the same time, it does not appear that this malarious belt extends very far from the river. The Boundary Commissiou marched down the Tiban in December 1903, from the Dakkam to near Musaimir. Camps were, wherever possible, selected on the high plateaux several hundred feet above the river. Turning oft near Musaimir, the Commission passed two months near Ad-Dareja and above Hawaimi in the Wadi Natid. There was practically no malaria either among the personnel or the escort. Anopheles mosquitoes were observed, though not in large quantities, and no doubt in the rainy season the results would have been different. Prophylactic quinine parades were regularly held. The quality of the drinking water in the parts visited was on the whole, good, and, though dysentery occurred, dis- ' due to water cannot be said to have borne a large part in the general health of the troops. With regard to the diseases most prevalent among the Ambs and which came under the notice of the various medical officers malaria was almost universal, more severe of course in the vallev and similar districts, where greatly enlarged spleens, duetto malaria, even among small children, were the rule. Syphilis was common, and many cases came for treatment Leprosy is ; nt infrequent, especially near the coast. Several cases : 'an' r weS met ^th! and LMedical Officer with the Com mission discovered a cancer 'nest' at a village on the Upper San Ulcers and bad sores were frequently met With, the native treatment for these being to bind a brass plate over the affected part. Cases of guinea-worm were observed Small- Tinx from time to time causes great ravages; vaccination is known among the Arabs, many of whom undergo it when visiting Aden or Shaikh Othman, and they practise a rude form of inoculation themselves, but this is, of course, by no means urn- wrsal Plague, when prevalent in Aden, is said to have caused I^aVrable mortality in the interior, but nothing has been heard of it lately. Ophthalmia and other diseases of the eye are frequently met with. This seems more prevalent in the Lf towns The general impression left by a flying visit to Mukalla was that about half the children were blind of one eye Medical knowledge, as might be expected, is practically nil. The properties of a few plants used as purges, etc., are73 1 known, but firing is generally resorted to in serious cases. Sao? tation in the towns and villages is unknown. Latrines are Usually a projection from an upper story, the filth being allowed to accumulate below and every village is surrounded by a mound of refuse and the excrement of generations of domestic animals In the coast-towns, such as Mukalla and Shehr, open cess-pools project from the houses into the street into which the drainage from the houses.' is carried. The odours of the streets are not easily forgotten. For information regarding Aden and Soqotra see under 'Aden' and 'Soqotra' earlier in this Chapter. Amlri. There is a difference of nearly 6,000 feet between the highest and lowest altitudes in the Amir of Dhala's territory. It follows that there is much variety of climate. In the valleys off the Bana and the Tiban and in the low country south of the Dhala heights the heat is severe during the greater part of the year, and the climate is malarious and ill-suited to Europeans. •i. • Jt i ro On the Dhala plateau, the elevation of which varies from about 5,000 feet to about 4,300 feet the climate is comparatively cool and healthy, sufficiently so to suggest its suitability for a sanatorium for Aden. It is an equable climate ; no real cold in the winter months, and in summer the heat, though try- ing at times. Was never very severe. The lowest temperature recorded under the outer fly of tent was 40° tti February, the highest 102° in June. The diurnal range of temperature is often as much as 30° and over. The prevailing wind at all times of the year Was from the south-east. The rainfall is precarious. It is not evenly distributed, and does not appear to depend upon any regular monsoon current. It nearly all falls during the months of June, July and August, and is in the form of sudden thunderstorms of short duration, and very local in their character. The total rain fall for 1902 was a little over 18 inches. From December to March, the air is fresh and clear, and fairly bracing. Though there is practically no rain, a good deal of moisture is furnished by the regular mornins mists C387GS'B74 known by the Arabs as 'Am Amma'. The mist gathers in heavy masses in the valleys, and generally rolls up to the pla teau with the southerly wind by about 8 or 9 in the morning, and is dispersed by the sun towards midday. Not frequent ly thick wet mist forms during the night over the Dbala plateau and lasts for the greater part of the day. A north wind blew at time? in the morning and there was then no mist. In April and May there was much gusty wind, with dust, and occasional thunderstorms. In May 1903, in the country about Kataba, there was daily rain for a week or more. In June, July and Agust there was much atmospheric dis turbance. Frequent thunderstorms with heavy rain and hail, generally in the afternoon, made the air cool and pleasant. These storms seldom lasted for more than an hour or two. They circled round and came from all directions, but most frequently from the north and west. The mountain mass of Jabal Jaliaf seemed to intercept many storms and prevent rain falling in the immediate neighbourhood of Dhala, and the rainfall on Jabal Jahaf and in the plain country to the north appeared to be greater than at Dhala. The hailstones do much damage to yoang crops, especially on Jabal Jahaf. The wind sometimes blew from the north for some days during the summer and autumn months and was accompani ed by a good deal of haze. In July and August this wind brought large flights of locusts which were very destructive. September, October, and November were the most un healthy months of the year. Malaria was very prevalent, not only among Europeans, and natives of India, but also among the Arabs themselves. Anopheles mosquitoes were present, though not in great n3 .111 bers, from July to October. The most prevalent diseases among the troops were malaria, dysentery, bronchitis, and boils. Much of the sickness was con tracted while marching through the low-lying country, and muck was due to exposure in tents, and would no doubt disappear under more favourable conditions.77 fj The heights of Jabal Jahaf 2,500 feet above the Dhala plain offer a much more bracing climate with a much cooler tempera ture during the summer months. The violent istorms, which visit Jabal Jahaf during July, August and September, and the cold weather mists, have been regarded as disadvantages, but with good shelter they should do no harm» l Alam. The climate is moist and unhealthy. Baidd. A rainy season of three months' duration begins in July. The temperature then is cool and pleasant.

In winter the cold is sufficient to freeze the streams.79 Veterinary* Mange is very prevalent throughout, and is responsible for many break-downs. The Arab, though he knows the remedy well enough, is often rery careless about it in the earlier stages. Katran, a kind of native tar, much used in the Sudan, is as good a remedy as anything, and can be obtained at almost any Arab village. There are occasional out-breaks of African horse-sickness in Aden, and also, it is believed, at A1 Hauta (JLahej). Wastage in animals, —Few data are available, as the transport for the Boundary Commission (the only operations of any dura- ton) was mostly hired. Horses and mules kept in good condition, and among the camels losses were very few, those which occurred among the hired transport were chiefly due to the owners working unfit, or immature, animals.go CHAPTER III. POWLATION. The Arabs belong to the Sttnni sect of Mnhammadans and, generally speaking, the more civilized they are the more they are fanatical and suspicious of foreigners ; while the wild Beduin of the desert pays but littb attention to the practice of his religion and k almost entirely ignorant of its tents. It serves, however, as a temporary bond of union against the rest of the world. The Wahabi and Seuussi movements that have affected other parts of the Muhammadan world have had no influence on the tribes in the Aden Protectorate. The British Protectorate is inhabited by a number of tribes, each sub-divided into sub-tribes or clans, varying both in char acter, in their manner of living and in the nature of their political institutions. They may be said to present the same essential characteristics, modified to some extent by their origin, and still more so by the nature of the country they inhabit. The ruling trait in the Arab character is pride and an intense love of inde pendence. This is noticeable throughout, though naturally less so, in the case of a tribe like the 'Abdali, in constant com^ munication with Aden. To such an extent is it carried in the case of the wilder tribes like the Subaihi or the Upper Yafa'i, that in the case of the former, scarcely a clan owns one acknowledged tieadman, and in the case of the latter, who nominally own allegiance to one Sultan, the powerful tribal Shaikhs are ready at a moment's notice to disobey him, if his views do not happen to fall in with theirs, and every tribesman is equally tfeady to differ from the views of his Shaikh and to follow his own impulse. Curiously enough, therefore, this love of independence is a source of weakness rather than strength, as it is the chief factor in preventing tribes who might otherwise be formidable antagonists from combining. In fact, this quality may be more properly called impatience of control, and would make any use of Arabs as soldiers, except under the most irregular and lax con ditions, impossibly That they a/re both jealous and quarrelsome, the existence of blood-feuds among the various tribes gives ample proof, and treachery is often resorted to attain their ends. They are ordinarily self-contained and quiet in demeanour, but it takes81 very little to rouse them to a state of wild excitement, when they appear as yelling and gesticulating maniacs, liable at any mo ment to explode or to let off their guns ; still, in the wildest moments, a leaven of sense seems to remain which, as a rule, pre vents their going to extremities. Possibly by force of contrast, the quality, which they seem to admire most and which certainly produces the best effect, is firmness, combined with infinite pa tience and a quiet demeanohr. Anything in the shape of bluster or loss of self-control, either in the most important or most trivial transaction, seems to at once bring out the latent spirit of oppo sition. The Arab has quite enough shrewdness to know when severe measures have been deserved, but anything in the nature of arbitrary -conduct or hot temper receives his unsparing con demnation. In dealing with a variety of tribes with such different char acteristics, it is difficult to generalise ; broadly they may be di vided into settled and agricultural, and nomad, races, with the •differences due to, and inseparable from, their mode of life. The settled Arab is industrious ; the terraced fields on the mountain slopes, and the carefully constructed irrigation-channels, bear witness to a capacity for steady and persevering work. The women work hard, but the men do their share of the field work, the women's task being mainly about the housa and involving the carrying of water, which as the Arab invariably builds his tower on steep and rocky knolls is no light labour. Their habits are simple and their diet frugal. They are hospitable and, like ali Muhammadan communities, charitable to the poor, and their love of children, generally, is a very noticeable feature. It is a curious fact, that hated as is the Turkish rule throughout Yemen, Turkish deserters making for Aden, almost invariably arrive safely. They are, as a rule, quite destitute at starting, and depend entirely on the charity of the Arab tribes through which they pass. The Arabs are fanatical Muhammadans and much under the influence of their Saiyids, but, in ordinary intercourse with them, after the initial distrust has been overcome, their fanaticism is rarely apparent, and the chief men, not excluding the Saiyids, are ordinarily courteous in their demeanour and pleasant to deal with. The quality which is perhaps most in evidence, and which is so repugnant to the average Englishman as to often overshadow C3870SB M82 their bettor qualities, is their excessive and very apparent cupid ity, which appears to be inherent in all classes. The religion of tho groat majority of tho country is that of the Shafi' sect of Sunni Muhammadans. Tho practice of the religion varies, of course, in tho different districts. Among some of tho nomad races, it is little more than a name, and more civilized Arabs say somewhat contemptuously of the wilder clans of the Subailu 'They do not even know how to pray.'' Mosques are universal, in tho villages, and are well kept, and in even tho wildest parts, shrines erected to the memory of soma departed Saiyid, are common, and are frequently the resorts of pilgrimage. Among the more settled population, education is carried on, on the usual Muhammadan lines, and it is the exception to find an Arab of such districts unable to read or write. Among the no mads, education is rather the exception than the rule. Physically the Arab is usually rather short, but wiry and capable of great endurance and exertion. In many districts there is a considerable admixture of negro blood, but tho puro Arab possesses aquiline, sometimes rather Jewish features, with a light brown complexion, and bright and intelligent eyes.

The inhabitants are divided into 'Arabs ' and Cfe Bedouins,' the latter inhabiting the mountains and the more sterile western half of the island. The so-called ' Arabs ' are a mongrel race descended from Arabs, Indians, Somalis, Portuguese and other nations. They all wear the same dress, speak the same language, and observe the same customs, but their features vary from the negro type to that of the pure Arab. They are bigoted Muhammadans and cannot be trusted to the same extent as the Bedouins. Their chief occupations consist of the cultivation of small patches of ground, the tending of cattle, the minding of date-groves, fishing and trafficking, but the greater part of their time is spent in idleness, coffee drinking, visiting and gossip. The Bedouins may be looked upon as the aborigines of the island. They are divided into families or tribes, each occupjdng a defined domain and having at its head a patriarch, whose office is hereditary, but whose influence is^now hardly more than nomi nal. Fortunately the Bedouins are a peaceable people, having no weapons but sticks and stones, and occasionally knives picked up from the Arab traders. They usually dwell in caverns, which are exceedingly numerous in the limestone regions throughout the island, and lead a wandering life to find pasturage for their numerous herds. Like the Arabs they are Muhammadans, but, like the island Arabs, the doctrines of Muhammad sit lightly upon them. Their moral character is high and the occurrence of heinous crimes is very rare. They are very shy of strangers, but, when their confidence has once been gained, very hospit able. 'Abdall. The district inhabited by the 'Abdali is known as Lahej a,iid the capital is Al-Hauta. The population, which is roughly esti mated at 15,000, consists of 'Abdali Muwallads,* across between Arabs and Africans who are only a degree below pure Arabs in social status, a sprinkling of Somalis, Khadim, a migratory people of nogro descent employed as scavengers, and Hajiris,* another despised class who visit the maritime plain in harvest time a *The number of Hajiris in 'Abdali territory is estimated at 150 and the number of Muwallads at about 400. m2 5 \I 61.

Unlike most Muhammadans the 'Akrabi are not all total abstainers. Their usual alcoholic drink is toddy. It is impossible to give an estima,te of their population, but they are a small tribe capable of furnishing some 250 fighting men. 'Alawu The 'Alawi are a small tribe whose principal village is AI Kash'a, in the Sailat Hardaba, other villages being Al-Khariba, As-Sauda, Al-Hauta, Adh-Dhanib, Jiml and Al-Hajar. The total population does not exceed 1,500* They are a friendly tribe ? on bad terms with their neighbours, the Kotaibi. The inhabitants consist of tribesmen, and &lt;6 Ra ? ayaor subjectSj in about equal proportion. They have slight peculiarities of dialect by which they may be identified. The population of the villages is as follows :— Al-Kash'a Al Khariba As-Sauda ma •• *0 •• Adh-Dhanib . • Jiml •• •• •• .. •' Al-Hajr Tribes subject to the Amir of Dhdla. The Amir of Dhala's territory is inhabited by a number of different tribes that have little in common besides their Arab nationality, and few ties to bjind them together beyond the need for mutual support and protection. Many of them barely 500 100 200 100 50 100\ 86 acknowledge the Amir's suzerainty. Their frequent fouds and dissensions keep them apart, and they cannot be regarded in any sense as one people. Society is divided into classes as usual among Arabs, viz., the Saiyids, the priestly caste descended from the Prophet; the Shaikhs, hereditary chiefs; the Qabail, or tribesmen; the 'Asakir, professional soldiers ; the Ra'aya or peasant farmer class ; and the slaves. The people are physically a poor race, the men short and slight, though wiry and active. The majority are not pure Arabs, but show an unmistakeable strain of African slave blood. This is even the case with the Amirs themselves. There are a consider able number of pure negroes among them, the descendants of former slaves. The people are industrious and simple in their habits; they have the ordinary Arab characteristics of pride, and an intense love of independence. They are hospitable, self-contained under ordinary circumstances, but very excitable when provoked. They are very jealous and quarrelsome as is proved by the con- tant strife between tribes and clans, and the blood feuds in almost every family. The manner in which these feuds are carried on shows them to be vindictive and treacherous, with little sense of honour. They are much under the influence of their Saiyids, and have all the fanatica intolerance of a narrow-minded Muham- madan community. On the other hand, many of the better class men, not except ing the Saiyids themselves, when once their prejudices are over come, prove to be intelligent, courteous, and pleasant to deal with. ' r A considerable number of the people have travelled and seen the world, either as traders, or as stokers on board ships, but their experiences do not as a rule seem to have lessened their pre judices against the unbeliever. The women though kept in a position of inferiority as usual with Mussalmans, are not secluded, but go about freely and un veiled. They do a great deal of the work of the household, such as tending cattle, drawing water, cutting firewood, etc. The majority of the population is settled, living in villages of solidly constructed stone houses, and occupying them selves with agriculture and commerce. A large proportion how ever, in the southern part especially, are nomadic, keeping largeI .5 0t 87 herds of goats and sheep, and moving about as the grazing and water-supply at different seasons require. The men wear a loin cloth, a cloth wrapped round the waist and supporting the jambi'a knife, and a body cloth of dark blue cotton. The headdress is a small blue turban, but in the remoter parts of the hills the men bind a mere strip of cloth tightly round their heads, comb their hair out and tie it in a fuzzy bunch at the back of their heads. The custom of tying the 'fatila,' or slow match, round the turban is dying out, as matchlocks are replaced by rifles. It is usual to go barefooted, but for long distances on the stony hill-paths simple leather sandals are used. Every man carries either a rifle or a matchlock, or a spear and all wear the jambi'a, a broad curved dagger, in the waist cloth ; those of well-to-do people are handsome with chased silver sheaths. Men, who own rifles, wear a waist bandolier with cart ridges. The women wear a loose robe with wide sleeves, generally dark blue, but sometimes green or red, embroidered round the collar and dow n the front and back, and tied in at the waist by a sash of similar material, the embroidered ends of which hang down in front. They wear a dark head cloth, which falls gracefully over the shoulders. They often cover their faces and bodies with a yellow powder made from the 'waras,'' or bastard saffron, and Iluvcl (// iiti] n -'y 1''} i i ] I (it'J. /) as a precaution against fever. On occasions they paint their faces with designs in narrow black lines, and some daub their cheeks with a greasy pigment of a ver milion hue. Their chief food consists of bread made from wheat or millet; ' asid,' a thick porridge made of flour with 'soman ' (ghi, or clari fied butter), and boiled goat's flesh, or a soup called 'maraq.' Fowls and eggs are regarded as luxuries. As vegetables they take onions, garlic, carrots, and radishes. They drink coffee at all times, generally a concoction from the husk, called 'qishr,' flavoured with ginger. The men smoke a great deal, using ordinary hookahs, and either Indian tobacco, known as ' surati, ' or country tobacco, called ' hanumi ' which comes from Mukalla and elsewhere, and the best quality of which is called ' arifi.''88 All who can afford it are addicted to chewing 'leal.' There are no regular doctors, but some Saiyids profess a knowledge of alchemy and the use of herbs as medicines, and dis pense extracts from the Koran as charms. Barbers bleed and cup and perform circumcision. In the rainy season, when fever is prevalent, a common cactus called * kassas ' is chopped up and mixed with food as a purgative. For ulcers, which are very common, effusion from leaves are dsed, and a brass plate is bound firmly over the sore. For aches and pains it is usual to sear the patient with a hot iron. Sanitary arrangements are wanting. Latrines even in the best houses are merely projections from the wall in the upper ■storey, the filth being allowed to accumulate below. The religion of the country is that of the Shafi'i sect of the Sunni Muhammadans. The masjids are kept with care, and the hours of prayer generally observed. Shrines are very numerous, every section of the population having one to which it is specially devoted. The shrines are either to a revered ancestor, or to some patron saint of ancient tradition. The position of *7nan- sab 5 in charge of a shrine is an honoured one, and is generally hereditary. The more sacred shrines are centres of pilgrimage. All joyous occasions are celebrated by feasting, slaying bul locks or sheep or goats, and eating ' kaV Anv solemn compact between tribes and individuals is sealed by the killing of a goat in the name of the Almighty. The Arabs are punctilious in matters of etiquette. A Shaikh always receives any visitor of distinction with the ' TashiraJ or a salute of guns, with ball cartridges as a rule ; and he would oonsider himself slighted, if the visitor did not accept his hospi tality for at least a night. The ordinary mode of greeting bet ween friends is to clasp and kiss the back of one another's hands. An inferior greeting a Shaikh or Saiyid will bend low and kiss him on the knee, and head, and even on the back. There are many local peculiarities of dialect, and the language differs in many respects from the Arabic of Egypt. The tribes of the Amir of Dhala's territory may be grouped as follows:— 1. The Amir's own relatives, connections and dependants. 2. The Shairi.89 3. The Ahl Jahaf, Bam Sa'id, and the A hi Mafari. 4. The Azraki and the Mihrabi. 5. The Humaidi and the Ahmadi. 6. The Dakkam. 7. The Halmin. 8. The AFAjud tribes. The Amir's own clan are known as the AM Ahmad or Ahl-ul- Amir, They together with related clans, the Bani Mas'ad, 'Ayal Murshid, 'Aydl Muthanna, etc., live in Dhala town, and in the Ash-Sharaf district, in Zobaid south of Dhala, and in the districts of Tafwa in the Hardaba valley and Khatafa in the Wadi Dabab. The other branches of the Amir's clan are :— The Bam Ilddl of the Ash-Sharaf villages of Dhi Haran, Al- Wa'ra, Kokaba, 01 Sumaid, and Ar-Rabat ; and of Kharafa. The Banl Mutahhar of Kharafa and of the northern part of the Dhala plain, viz., the villages of Al-Husain, Marfad Lakmat- ush-Shub, Kubah, Utaria, Sannah, etc. The Banl Shafai of Dhala Zobaid, Haiaz and Kharafa. The Baul HuTshid of Khobar and Minadi. The Banl Qdsim of Dhala, Harir, Tafwa and Kharafa. Besides the above there are a great many families who, though not blood connections of the Amir, are immediately sub ject to and dependent upon him. Such are the Banl Ahadl, of Dhala, the Ahl Amama and Banl Ydqut~ul-Kahaila~ul-Janadha of A1 Khabar, Bam Juharl of Habil Dhi Ishar, the Banl Masha, Banl Habjur and Bdnl 'UHadldl of Zobaid. The Banl Juwair of Al-Hajar and Al-Kurb, the Ahl Sa'ld Ismd'll and Ahl Kurman of Marsaba, and the Bani 5 1-Kumasi of Laghwal. The people of Jabal Harir also come under the heading of immediate dependents of the Amir. They are of the Ra'dya class, and number about 800 souls. They were formerly under Yafa influence and are perhaps of Yafa origin. Other communities that are among the immediate dependents of the Amir are :— The Ahl Haj Sa'ld oi Lakmat-us-Sallah, Sha'b-ul-As'ud, Ad- Dahar, Bajaha and Hadida, They are a Saiyid clan who claim to C387GSB ^ ' K •90 be descendants of 'Abdui Qadir Jailam; Ha) Sa'id was born in Hadhramaut; he became a darwesh, migrated and settled near Jabal Ha did, the spur of Jabal Jahaf above Lakmat-ns-Sallah. He is said to have wrought many miracles ; his tomb is preserved with much veneration and his descendants are revered by the people of Dhala as their special Saiyids. The Ahl Haj Sa'id number about 500 souls. The Abid of Hazzat-ul-Abid, a district comprising four vil- ages at the north-eastern foot of Jabal Jahaf. They are des cendants of former slaves and number about 600 souls. The AM Basaisl of Al-Minadi, a clan of hereditary caravan guides and camel contractors, who originally immigrated from Haushabi country. Some of them are still in Haushabi territory, some in Shairi country, and some in Yemen at places on the cara van route to San'a. Those of Al-Minadi number about 50 souls. Altogether the immediate subjects of the Amir probably number about 6,000 souls. Shairi. The Shairl inhabit the central part of the Dhala plateau, the bills to the east, and the Khuraiba valley. The estimated population is about 3,000, with about 500 fighting men. There are about 30 villages. They are divided into five clans :— 1.

These belonged formerly to the Mafari. Azrahl. The Azrahl (Ahl Azarak) inhabit the valley south of Dhaia, approached by the Naqil Darjat-un-Nishli pass ; they also in habit the hills further south down to the Haushabi border. There are two divisions :— The Saba descended from the Yafa, Bani Saba. The Murhaibi descended from the Zaidi of Hashid wa Bakil, • northern Yemen. They are bounded on the north and west by Dhala ; Mafari; Ahmadi; Mihrabi ; and Haushabi. On the south by Haushabi- and 'Alawi. On the east by 'Alawi, and the Amir of Dhala's districts of Adh-Dhubayyat, Az-Zanad, and Zobaid. The most northerly outlying village is Thalath on the hilis miles due west of Dhala town. The gorge of Al-Madhiq in the Wadi Tabaghain marks the meeting point of the territories of the Azraki, MafarJ, Ahmadi, and MihrabL o2100 The hill of Safa Atla on the right bank of the Wadi-ul-Milah marks the meeting point of the territories of the Azraki, Haushabi and 'Alawi. Estimated population, —1,800, with about 350 to 400 men capable of bearing arms. The Shaikhs have full criminal jurisdiction over the tribe. They pay no tribute to the Amir, but are required to give mili tary service in time of war. The settled population is chiefly centred in villages in the valleys of the Sailat-ul-Azarak, which is the upper course of the Wadi Tabaghain. There are fair perennial springs near the northernmost villages, but the rainfall is precarious, and the crops are to some extent dependent on freshets from the surrounding hills in the rainy season. To the south across the hills (JabalMashwara, etc.), which bound the above valley, are several deep valleys, the nomad inhabitants of which constitute rather more than half the popu lation of the Azraki. The district is called Balad-us-Saraya Ruhba. The chief valleys are those of the Sailat Tuwana, and the Selat Mashwara (upper course of the Wadi-ul-Milah). To the south-west the Wadi Makhran, draining to the Tiban, has a small Azraki population (40 men). There are isolated patches of cultivation in all these valleys, but for the most part they are narrowly enclosed between steep rocky hills, and water is nowhere plentiful,, The people are pastoral.

Country. —The country is a confused mass of barren rocky hills, with deep winding valleys, the chief of which are the Wadi Lassat, the Wadi Raima, and the Wadi Hadwa. There are small patches of cultivation near the villages in these Wddls, but the only villages with any extent of cultivation are those in the Az raki valley, Kafla, Ubab, and Na'man. The Mihrabi are chiefly pastoral. The highest peaks are Jabal Mashwara (6,355 foet) and Jabal Kohilan (5,462 feet), on the north, and Jabal Lassat (4^929 foet) on the south.108 Hesha: the gorge of the Wadi Tiban, between Jabal Jahaf and Jabal Hesha, down to the Ahmad! border at Sha b Mofata : and Jabal Umur, a big spur of the Jabal Jahaf system, which runs westward from Jabal Ayub to the Wadi Tiban just north of the Humaidi country. The northern entrance of the gorge of the Wadi Tiban is known as Bab-ul-Pajra-ul Asfal, and a gorge by which the Sailat Ka taba enters Dakkam territory is known as Bal-ul-Fajra, al-'Ali. The plain country inhabited by the Dakkam forms part of the wide tract of low-lying country known among the Arabs as 4 A1 Hajar. * This term comprises all the districts from Jabal gha'r and Jabal-ul-Aud on the north, to Jabal Hesha and Jabal Jahaf on the south, and from Jabal Marais on the east to Jabal Suhban on the west. The northern border of the Dakkam is the boundary between the territory of the Amir of Dhala and the Turkish district of Al-Yubf. The western border the boundary between Dhala territory, and the Turkish districts of Al-Haiki and Jabal Hesha. The Ahl Dakkam are said to have originated from the Umur division of the Haushabx, and to have migrated to the Al-lajra country, where they maintained an independent position until they were conquered and subjugated by the Amir Shafal Abd- ul-Hadi. They pay no regular tribute but bring an annual pre sent to Dhala in token of allegiance. The Turks exacted tribute in 1901. The estimated population is 1,800 with about 300 fight ing men.

The Dairi together with the Mahala'i inhabit the low country of the Wadi Diradam and Wadi^ir-Kabwa. They acknowledge the authority of Shaikh Muhammad Salih of the Kotaibi. They are mostly pastoral and nomadic, living in temporary settlements. The greater part of the Dairi are outside Dhala territory, on Jabal Harith, an eastern spur of the Radian mountains. The Dairi are divided as follows : • [a) Ahl Usaill (on Jabal Ahrath)— Ash-Sharak. 8 All ? Ubaid. (&amp;) Al-Ahmadl (on Jabal Sharak)— Hirath.

(c) Ahl-ud-Danaba— Ad-Danaba, Dar-ud-Dakka, (d) AM Hajaf—• Al-Hajat120 The various Saiyid communities settled in the Amir ot Dhala's territories constitute a large and important element in the population. Though generally looked up to as the priestly caste there is little in their outward appearance to distinguish them from ordinary Arabs. Only a few of the principal ones, who specially devote themselves to religious exercises, wear white clothes and carry rosaries. The majority dress similarly to the Arab tribesmen, carry arms as they do, and occupy them selves with agriculture and trading. They are as much engaged in feuds and quarrels, and as ready to resort to fighting. ' &amp; The Saiyid communities are generally wealthy and powerful and in most cases are practically independent. Saiyids are per mitted to marry women of other classes, but their own women may only marry Saiyids. Adh-Dhubafyat. —The Saiyids of Adh-Dhubayyat are of the branch of Saiyids known as ' Sufian who are said to have originated from Jibla near Ibb. The tomb of their founder' Abu Sufian, is, however, at the village of Sufian near the capita! of Lahej. They own a considerable extent of rich land and are very well to do and independent. They are greatly respected by all the people, and the shrine of Wali Hasan, the tomb of one of them who died 20 to 25 years ago, is the chief resort of pilgrims in the Amir of Dhala's territories. The Saiyids together with their adherents (the Bani Mashali, Bam Hashid and Bani'l-Anshali) and their slaves and depen dents, number about 500 souls, AM HajSri Id. —The Saiyids of the Ahl-Haj Sa'id have been described above among the immediate dependents of the Amir . Saiyids of Arshi. —-(See Bani Sa'id above). Hcdbil-ul-Jabr. —The Saiyids of Habil-ul-Jabr are a small community only numbering about 50. These Saiyids are asso ciated in many ways with the Yafa across the Wad! Bana. Jews. —.Jews also constitute a considerable element in the population numbering some thousands (Crawford says 5,000). Their largest settlements are in Dhala itself (400), at Khurdi on Jabal Jahaf, at Al-Malaha of the Shain, and at Habil-uI-Jilb at the foot of the Shaibi hills. They are treated by the Arabs with a good deal of contumely and kept under various restrictions, such as not being allowed to own land, not to carry arms, nor to build houses of more than one121 storey. Nevertheless they seem to be a fairly .prosperous arid contented community. They live in quarters set apart for thorn and support themselves as traders, weavers and artificers* The men are distinct from the Arabs in dress and appearance. They wear a white loin cloth, and a longitudinal garment with a hole in the centre by which it is passed over the head, the gar ment falling to the waist in front and behind, and being tied by strings at the side. On the head is a coloured skull cap and long locks of hair are brought down in front of the ears. They are industrious, submissive people, and many of them have good features, and not unpleasing appearance. Upper 'Aulahi. —No estimate of the total population can be given. The principal towns and villages in the Upper ? Aulaki Sultanis territory are as follows:— Estimated population, Misab .. .. ,4,000 Hamman. Al-Mishkafa. Khumari Umm Salab . , 1,000 Musaina'a. An Nakub. Ta'an. Soltib. Muqbala. Al- Y aul. Ash-Shirj. Ar-Rukba. Dathina. In the Upper 'Aulaki Shaikh's territory there are no towns and the inhabitants are chiefly nomads. The following are some of their villages :— As-Sa'ald. AI-Atf. Kaula. Idat-Shams. Yeshbum. As-Sufal. The sub-tribes under the Upper 'Aulaki Sultan are the foJlow- ing Al Hajar. Marazlk.

Al-Ahdal. Al-'Abdum. Tausalf. Bakri - Baras. Yeslami. Lower Aulahl.— The total population may be roughly estimat ed at 15,000 souls. The principal places are : Al-Mauka'a. Ash-Shukaib. Hamara. Al-Kabs. Hauta, Al-Yaul. Al-Mahfid. Al-Husn. Al-Haik. Hauad. Ahwar,— Said to have a population of 4,000 to 5,000 souls. The Lower 'Aulald consist of two main divisions, the Lak- mush and the Ba Kazim. The Lakmush, though among the Aivalik, are not of them. They claim to be of Himyaritic origin and to have kinship with their neighbours the Dhujaibi. The Ba Kazim have many sub-tribes, among whom are the following:— Sham' i. Yahwi. Yarlf'. A 111 Badi * Ah. Nashra. Ahl-Salim. Mansuri. Maribi, Ahl-ul-Haik, Hatali. Baz'ali. Ahl-ba-YarM. Of these the Sham'i takes the lead on account of their supposed superior intelligence and sagacity,123 Districts under Baida. Baidd or Balad-ud-Dakar {the plateau country). Baida proper is inhabited by some ten tribes :— Dubani. Madafari, Mash'an. The Azzani. Homaikani. The APUman Hashami, Dafari. Hayashi. Maljami (more properly class ed as a dependency). The fighting strength generally attributed to the first nine is 3,000 men, but this is probably much exaggerated. Taffa is a generic name comprising the Hayashi, Hashami and Dafan tribes. The soil is of a sandy nature and is fertile, indigo being 'grown as well as jowari and bajri. The inhabitants of Baida city are largely engaged in dyeing cloths. Other small tribes which appear to be directly dependent on Baida are :— The Banl Yuh. —Whose country is also called the Wad Markha. They number some 300 fighting men and their country is described as very fertile, the 'usual crops and fruits being grown, as well as cotton and indigo. The people are mostly weavers and cultivators. The Tahrl, —A small clan of 50 men, north of Maljami. Sul tan Husain-bin-'Ali of the 'Amm Rasas family lives with them. Villages. —A1 ? Ark and Ayai.

Marib (Saba)— A district under the Amir of Marib, As-Sharif Husain-bin- 8 Abd-ur Rahman, comprises the large city of Marib, in which the Sharif lives, and certain outlying villages. The country is level and sandy. Wells are said to be nume rous, and dates, cotton and indigo are grown. Rock salt is also extracted from two hills, and exported in large quantities to dis tricts to the south and south-west. There are many camels and horses in the country. The population is said to be 1,500 men, of whom one-third, being weavers and dyers, are not classed as fighting men. Clans, —Ad-Dahana ? Ahl Sharjab, Bani'r-Rabi, Bani Sudan, Al-Ashraf, Bani'l-Hudaibi. The Ashraf number 300 men. Villages, —Al-Kal'a, Kusdan, Zobra, Bankala, Moj a, Al'Akaer. Balhdrith,' —A nomad tribe under the influence of the Amir of Marib, inhabit a tract which appears to be sandy desert, with oases containing wells and date palms. The inhabitants, who own horses, camels and large flocks, are tent-dwellers, and there are no settled villages.127 Clans. —Sudani 'Uzaibi, Raji, Muhsini. Hani or Hinna. —A smaller tribe of about 100 fighting men under the Amir of Marib. The people are entirely nomadic, owning horses and flock and living in tents. They also weave rugs and export salt. The country is sandy with a few wells and date-palms. Harib. —Is a large district under the Sharif 'Amr Hadi-bin- Ahmad, to whom the people pay tribute. It appears to be e ntirely independent at the present day. The country is fairly level and well cultivated, with numerous wells. Cotton and indigo are grown. There are two towns, Darb-ul-'Ali and Darb-Abu, Tuhaif built of brick, and many smaller villages. The population is estimated at 800 men, of whom the Ashraf, the only fighting men, number 200. The remainder are weavers and dyers in indigo. Clans. —Tuhaifi, Musa'i, Khashl, Madafari, Ahl Abu Komairi, Ahl Islam, Ahl 'Amr-ul-Wadi. Murdd—• Is a large district rugged and uncultivated for the most part. The inhabitants are independent nomads. Bastard saffron {warns) and coffee are said to be grown near the village of Ai-Rakhs. The majority of the people own largoflocks which they water from springs in the ravines, few wells existing. Ar-Rakhsis the only settled village, others being only tent settlements. They also traffic in salt, probably brought from Marib, which they exchange for grain, and weave rugs. Their fighting strength is estimated at 1,000 men.

They number some 50® fighting men and own flocks of sheep and goats. There is only one settled village, Ar-Ra'ed. Al Hada. —A nomadic tribe of some 300 fighting men: connected with the BanI Dabilnl, whom they follow. The ■country presents the same characteristics and is watered by small •streams draining to Murad. The people, who are tent dwellers, weave rugs and own flocks. As-Sabla is the only settled village. Koman. —A nomadic tribe with some 200 fighting men. Oharacteristics of people and country approximate to Al-Hada* It is connected with Jauf-ul-Khalid to the north-east, a dis trict, concerning which no details were obtainable. Fadhli, —The FadhlT are a proud, warlike, and indepen dent race, and possess in a high degree the virtues and vices of the true Bedouin. They are quick to take offence and are vin- •dictive and treacherous enemies, but, their friendship once secured, they are said to be trustworthy. This last statement must, however, be accepted with some reservation, as, like most Arabs in the neighbourhood, they possess few scruples, when their interests are concerned, and are always grasping and avaricious. In the arts of agriculture they are behind the 'Abdall. The total population is estimated at under 20,0@0, of whom about 6,000 reside at Shuqra, The Fadhli are sub-divided as follows :— ,. GOO 5.

Note. —From 1 to 14 of the above are hill tribes and from 14 to 22 are Abyan. The Markashi are a gait? sub-divided as follows :— (1) Ahl Salim. (2) Ahl Sanad. (3) Ahl 'Abad. (4) Ahl 'Amna-Busha. - (5) Bil'idi. (6) Hautari. (7) Mahmari. The Markashi claim descent from the Himiyarites, while the La third and Hasani come of Upper 'Aulaki stock. The code of morality among the mountaineers of the Fadhli appears to be of a lower order than that prevailing in the rest of the Yemen. The curious custom exists among the Markashi of holding a base-born son in greater estimation than a legitimate one. Haushabl. —The population of the Haushabi country is esti mated at about 7,000 souls, mostly nomads, who wander in search of grazing and water for their live stock, whilst a few are engaged in cultivation and camel driving. They form one tribe under their Sultan, sub-divided into some 50 small clans. There ar 3, however, two main divisions, the Haushabi proper, inhabiting the eastern part of the country, and the Tiban valley, as well as the northern boundary, and the 'Amiri (plural 'Umur), a division comprising some 6 clans inhabiting the tract enclosed by the Wadis Warezan and Akkan, and the Wadi Hidaba. They were formerly a small independent tribe who, some generations back, came under131 tV- domination of the Haushabi Sultan ; they pay tribute an d nir.y be considered an integral portion of the Haushabi. There are no large villages in the Haushabi country and many of the people are nomads. The 'Umur are the most independent spirits among them, but the Haushabi generally are peaceably disposed, and although, of late years, they have done a good deal of fighting with their neighbours, they would not coma under the heading of the War like tribes of Yemen. The classes of society represented in Haushabi territory are the Saiyids, whose principal colony is the shrine of Shabwa in tho north-west corner. They are of the Suflan branch, and connected with the Saiyids of Dhubayyat. The tribesmen form the bulk of the population. Those inhabiting the unhealthy Tiban and Warezan valleys ore much e^ffectod by malaria, and are of inferior physique, the personal retainers of the Sultan are represented by 'Asakir, of whom there are about 100, and the slaves.

Humunu. Sa'idi. 'Aliyyi. Kirzi. Tha'yan. The inhabitants of the district may be roughly divided into four classes. First the Saiyids and Sharif's, who are very influential in the Hadhramaut. They are to be found in all the large towns and considerable villages : disputes about property and water rights are referred to them ; although their influence is on the side of law and order, they are very distrust ful of foreign interference. They never carry arms. Even the Sultans show them marked respect and kiss their hands. Secondly, the Arabs proper, who are of Yafa origin. They live in towns and culti ate the lands around, trade with India and the Straits Settlements, and some of them are very wealthy. Thirdly, the Bedouins, who are scattered all over the country, do all the carrying trade, and rear and own most of the camels. They are very numerous and powerful and the Arabs of the towns are afraid of them, for they make travelling in the country very difficult, and even blockade the towns. They never live in tents : the richer ones have quite large houses, while the poor dwell in caves. Fourthly, the slaves and freed slaves who have married and settled in the country. They are all of African origin, many are cultivators, others are personal servants and soldiers of the Sultan. The most influential people in Mukalla are the Parsi business men from Bombay, and here Hindustani is very generally spoken. Kasddl. —The Kasadi were originally a sub-tribe!of the Yafa'i. The population of the country is very mixed, including Sidis Akabiras, Hajiris, and in Mukalla many Hadhranus and a considerable number of Indian traders, Khojas and Banias.135 The population is estimated at about 18,000 souls. Tbe principal towns with their approximate populations are- Mukalla Fuwwa Burum Khirba A1 Bakarain Harshiyyat Thikh Rukub .. (capital) Souls. 12,000 1,500 1,500 500 400 700 400 Mukalla, however, with its dependencies is now in the hands of the Ka'aiti, who conquered it in 1881. The Kasadi, properly speaking, has no sub-tribes, but it has a sub-division, called the Nakhkhabin. Kathlrl. —The Kathin are enterprising travellers and are found scattered over various parts of India, Java, Singapore, and Aden ; also in other parts of Asia and Africa. The total population is not known, but for number of fighting men, see Chapter V, Military. Their principal towns a^e :— Terim (capital). Bur. Al-ghuraf. Maryamih. Sirvun. Tins. Tariba. Al-ghurfa. Mahrl. —The Mahri tribes are almost certainly survivors of the oldest Arabian race, forced out of richer lands in the south by the Semitic peoples. They speak a tongue which is distinct from Arabic and not Semitic in origin, practice animistic cults, and have the superstitious habits of a refugee population. The poorer classes show great indifference to religion and many are unable to repeat the prescribed forms of prayer. The popu lation of Soqotra is estimated at 9,000 souls, while that of the136 mainland, including many Bedouin tribes, is reported to amount to 50,000. Qishn is the capital and the residence of the Sultan. The other principal villages of the mainland are Dafkut, Jubail, Shin, Shanhit, Wadi, Daghbant, Kidlfut, Kaish, Khartanut, Harut, Haswain, Mokhaifik, Saihut. Qishn and Soqotra belong to the Ahl 'Afrir, a Mahri tribe that does not number above 20 persons. The following Mahri tribes are reported to be subject to the Sultan :— Bait Ziyad. Bait Harawuz. Bait Bararshi. Bin Mahamid. Bin 'Akid. Bin Jadhi. Bin Duhus. Bin 'Ali-Sa'd. Bin Sahl. Bin Basir. Bin Rab'ain. Bin 'Isa bin Mubarak. Bin 'Assut. Bin Da'kan. Bin Shara. Bin 'Ilayyan. Bin Mahmush. Bin Kalshat. Bin Salaimi. Bin Maghfik. Suhaihi. —The Subaihi are mainly nomadic. They have no Sultan nor head Shaikh, and are divided into a number of sub- tribes with very little cohesion and frequently blood-feuds between them. The classes chiefly represented in the Subaihi country are the tribsemen, and the Saiyids, who are very numerous in the Wadi Ma'adin and in small settlements to the west (in the Mudariba valley, Turan, etc. ). The majority of these are of the Sufian branch. They are peaceable people, and though many •of them go armed, are not, at any rate, aggressive. The '' Hajiri '' are also frequently met with, and are a very useful class as messengers, guides, etc. The Hajiri are said to have migrated from a village of that name in the Hadhra- maut. They are of unmistakeable African origin, and are migratory in their habits, travelling from place to place, •and working at harvest-time, collecting supplies for petty trading transactions, etc. Of all the tribes.in the vicinity of Aden the Subaihi approach nearest to the typical Bedouin character. They are divided into a large number of petty clans. Few of these devote any137 attention to agriculture, nor do thdy engage to any extent in commerce. Many members of the tribe, however, earn a livelihood as Muhadams or leaders of c?*ravans from other dis tricts which pass through the Subaihi country en route to Aden, On account of their frugr.l diet, which consists of little else than jowari, they are very spare in fr^me, but possess great powers of endurance. They are extra neljr poor 9 and possess no horses and few camels. Humcddl, Basus, Juhain, Huzaiml. —Are all $mall clans inhabiting the north-east corner near the Madraja and adjoin ing the Juhaili mount?&lt;.ms, but now actually abutting on the Turkish districts. It is difficult to imagine bow these people live as there is, to all practical purposes, no water in the rocky wastes they inhabit. The Humaidi, and probably others, make use of Bir Humaid on the north side of the Madraja pass, and the Basus are said to use the Tiban at night. There is no known water-supply on the south side of the Madraja, in any but the very smallest quantity (Bir Mala'ut dry), though it is very pro bable that water may exist at the foot of the Juhaili hills. They own flocks of goats and purchase what '^rain they use. more especially have the repu a ion of shameless highway robbert the mouth of the Akkan, and the Tiban at Tannan near Nubas Dakim, being particularly dangerous places for small bodies of travellers. The Juhaill, —Inhabiting the eastern extremity of th r ; Kubati range and bordering on the west with that tribe, are a small clan of about 100 men who have, since demarcation, once more been included among the Subaihi. Although of Subailu stock, from the circumstance of their living actually on the mountains adjoining the Kubati, they have for several generations fallen under the influence of the Kubati Shaikh, and have paid taxes to the Turks, when these wore forcibly exacted from the Kubaiti. Their hills, comprising some 5 small villages, are fertile and well-watered, and neither the country nor the people can be said to partake of the characteristics of the Subaihi. The Matarafl. —West of the Humaidi, live in the Wad is Mulaihia and Dar and border on the Kubati. The three stone towers in Wadi Mulaihia are evidently more for the purpose of defence than residence, the majority of the people living in temporary huts of Karhl. There is a narrow strip of cii- tivation in Wadi Mulaihia and somewhat more in Wad J D5r C387GSB138 near Bir Kurain, but it is entiraly dependent on the rain fall, and when traversed in February, 1904, did not appoar to have produced a crop in the preceding year. The remainder of their country is very rugged and barren and with the exception of Bir Kurain, a good well, and some spring's in Suaida ravine—some 2 miles north of Bir Kurain and near the foot of the Kubati mountains—it appears to be waterless.. The pools in the Suaida ravine, though somewhat difficult of access, would have watered (February 1904), at the least, 500 camels. Water was reported in two adjacent ravines, but there was no opportunity of inspecting it. The North-East Subaihi tribes are physically rather fine men, lightly built, but very wiry. Many of them have good features and bright, singularly light coloured eyes. They are exceedingly ignorant and suspicious, and require most care ful treatment to avoid arousing hostility. Most, if not all, seen were armed with breech-loaders (mostly the universal Legras carbine), and it is no exaggeration to say that their fingers are, figuratively, continually on their triggers. The Matarafi own riding camels but not apparently in large numbers. Throughout the whole Subaihi .country, the riding camels observed were all exceedingly young—the owners evi dently selling all animals of 4 years of age and using the young ones for their own riding, at the same time breaking them to the saddle. Curiously enough, this does not seem to produce the bad effect one would expect, as the Subaihi riding camel is much sought after and bears a high reputation for en durance. The Matarafi own large flocks of goats which they pasture at the foot of the Kubati hills. The blood-feud, which exists between them and the Kubati is probably owing to disputed pasture rights in the first instance. TheMakMumi. —Living in Wadis Alasan and Marasa, com prise some 5 sections. The country is much the same as that previously described, a little cultivation existing in the two river-beds. The only two wells known (Bir Ghassan in Wadi Alasan and Bir Marasa) contain a poor supply of water. A ravine—al-Kadi—near the foot c f the Kubati hills north of Dar Murshid Nasir, is reported to contain a good supply of water, but there was no opportunity of inspecting it. Doubt less there are several water-holding ravines along the Kubati139 border, but the suspicious and semi-hostile people keep their existence secret. The Mansurl, —Living in the neighbourhood of the Wadi Masharij, number about 300 men, and were formerly the most powerful of the Subaihi tribes, exercising effectual, as they still do (in the case of the Shujaifi at least) nominal, suzerainty over the Shujaifi, Jaz'ai,and Koraihi clans to the north-west. These clans held the position of ^ Ra'aya' or subjects of the Mansuri, to whom they paid tribute. The continual feuds existing among the Subaihi tribes for many years past have served to destroy the preponderating influence of any particular tribe, and to cause the small out lying clans to the north to fall almost entirely under the influence of the powerful Turkish tribes of Kubati, Absi, and Yusufi. The actual chief of the Mansuri is Saif ba 'Abdalla, a boy of about 14, his uncle, Salih ba Ahmad, administering his affairs for him. There is a little cultivation in the Wadi Masharij around the few scattered towers, and a little in the Wadi Sulaib. The only well in Wadi Masharij had fallen in, and the owner was given money to repair it. A good many riding camels were seen, 'dijr'' (vetch), which was plentiful, being the fodder used for them. AM Heh. —The small sections inhabiting the Wadi Heh, which contains some cultivation but no well, are counted among the Mansuri. The Khulaifi, especially, bear a reputation for robbery and were originally domiciled near the' Abdali border, from which the Sultan forced them to move in consequence of thoir constant depredations. They are still said to push their raids as far afield as the Tiban. These clans were the only Subaihi who manifested any overt hostility to the passage of the commission, causing some delay by disputing the passage of the Am Fidna pass into Wadi Heh. When driven from the heights, they continued firing from Dar Ibrahim, which was partly destroyed by shell-fire, and from the surrounding hills, and they subsequently fired a few shots into camp at night on sev^ral occasions. The Dubainl. —Beyond the Wadi Heh, the country becomes markedly more fertile in character,—Wadi Umm Farsha, the head-quarters of the Dubaini, containing the first date-palms mot t2140 With, and good strips ^of cultivation extending down to tW sandy plain near Dar-ul-Kudainii ? with several small villages of two or three towers apiece, and several wells. Umm Farsha itself is supplied by two wells, of whieh one contains a good quantity of water, but both are brackish. The 'Dubaim villages also extend westwards along Wadi Aliij, in v/hich there is a well, to the southern part of Wadi Hakat where there is a good deal of cultivation with date-palms and a good well at Birain. Although the Dubaim and the Jurabi' are at feud, ex ception seems to fee made in the case of Jaraiwi section, whose principal village, Tafih, is in the Wadi Ma'adin among those of the Jurabi. The Zaidm are a small tribe north of the Dtibaim near the Ku- batl border numbering some 60 mm. They live in the Wadls Tukar (uppef part of the Wadi Umm Farsha), Hakat, and Sihr. Although they have of late years to some extent fallen under the influence of the Kub&amp;ti Shaikh, Salim, they have always re mained entirely Subaihi. The Shujaift —This is not, however, the case with the Shujaifi, a small scattered elan (v. Statement &amp;, Mansuri), the villages in th&amp; Wadis Sha'b and Yumit having been practically absorbed by the Absi Shaikh, who collected taxes from them on behalf of the Turks. The Shujaifi in the Wadi Sha'b have been restored to Subaihi status, those in the Yusait remaining on the Turkish side of the boundary. There is a small stream in Wadi Sihr near Nubat-us-Sihr and a good deal of cultivation around both Zaidin and Shujaifi vil lages. The Ahl Sha'b inhabit the eastern extremity of the Wadi Sha/b y which is very fertile. They are a small community of Saiyids or religious sect, who have of late years come under the influence of the Absi Shaikh and through him paid dues to the Turks. They have now been included within the boundaries of the Subaihi. Their headman, one 5 Abd-ul-Qawi, is a courtly and well educated old gentleman, who passed many years at the Court of the Nizam, of Hyderabad and forms a curious contrast to his wilder neighbours. The Jurdbl —The JurabTj sub-divided into a number of sections and numbering between 300 and 400 men, inhabit the valley141 of the Wad* Ma'adin, which is by far the richest part of ther Subaihi county* Not only is the head of the Wadi a singularly well-adapted col- lecting basin for the rainfall rendered certain by the neighbour hood of the high Absi and Yusufi mountains, but a good stream appears twice in the Wadi between Mafalis and Kuhlan, by means of which the fields near the Wadi itself can be frequently watered m the dry season. There are several wells in the Wadi itself as well as at Ghurik and at Habil-us-Sabt. Groves 01 date-palms are^nu- merousv most of the produce being sold wholesale by the ^tree' to contractors from Aden. The staple rain-crops are jowari and baj- ri; good irrigated crops of Indian corn were being cut at the end of February. Sesamum, mustard seed used for making oil-cake, and a few limes are also grown. Although some 600 transport camels were stationed for nearly two months in the Wadi Ma adin, no difficulty was experienced in supplying them with Jcarbi, ^ 10 camel-men and others dependent on native supplies, were able to obtain all they required at very reasonable rates. here was not much demand for meat,, the troops being sup plied with Somali sheep and goats from Aden,, but beef of fair qual ity was procurable locally, and the Arab breedis ; of sheep and goats were plentiful. The sheep, although affording good mutton, are small, and cost, usually, 4 dollars a head. Several large markets are held near the Jurabi border, the only one actually in Subaihi territory being Suq -us-Sabt (Saturday) in the Wadi Ma'adin at Ghurik. Others held are a Wednesday market in the Humaidi country in Wadi Mia bak, one near the Ath- wari border, and one near the Koraihi villages below Mafalis. Coun try produce, animals^ etc^are sold, as well as imported goods such as cloths, sugar, cheap cigarettes, etc. Arms and ammunition are also procurable, the chief market for these being Suq -ur-Rabu in the Humaidi (Turkish) country. A Legras carbine costs 14 dol lars, about 12 rounds of ammunition going to the dollar. The Jurabi are well armed, and should be a powerful tribe well able to resist the encroachments of the pLurkish tribes, but they are much weakened by internal dissensions, which prevent their co-operating, except in case of actual hostilities. Attne present time (1904) a stubbornly prosecuted blood-feud exists between the Atawi and Mifyahi sections, with the result that the latter have been unable to obtain access to the stream to irrigate their fields for two years, can raise no crops and their palm-trees are dying*142 but neither the Qadhis n or other influential men have succeeded in adjusting matters. The two streams—the Ghail Akashi and the Ghail Maula--as well as being the life of the country, are also the cause of most of the internal disputes. They are each controlled by a tribesman bearing the hereditary designation of the 6 'Sid-ul-Ma' or controller of the water, to whom the various sections pay dues for the use of it. The water is diverted now to this, and now to that, bank, and allotted to the various individuals for a specified time, being led by artifical channels to the land to be irrigated. Attempts to divert or obtain an unfair share of the water lead to quarrels in the first instance, with a blood-feud to obtain for years. Treacherous murders in pursuit of these feuds are common and S3veral occurred during the stay of the Commission in the Wadi Ma'adin. One of the Subaihi Qldhis, Thabit Abu Bakr lives with the Jurabi at Habil-us-Sabt near the Sanawi shrine, the principal Qadhi living in Wadi Ma'bak with the Humaidi. Theoretically, disputes, etc., are submitted for their arbitra tion, but the Subaihi are an unruly people and not addicted to agreeing with a decision which does not fall in with their inclinations. Baggage camels are owned by the Jurabi as also by the Wahasha tribes, lower down the Wadi, but they are not nume rous. Al'Wahasha (v. statement A) is a generic name for several tribes living in the Ma'adin valley below the Jurabi. Of these the principal and the only tribe abutting on the Turkish boun dary are the Julaidl, who live at and near Shawar, at the east foot of the J. Iraf range. The Julaidi are another tribe whose influence, originally widely extended, has waned of late years. Although numeri cally weak, and actually inhabiting a very restricted area, the Julaidi Shaikh exercised influence, and exacted tribute in the past, from various small clans as far west as J. ^Akama, some 30 odd miles only, east of Mokha. But at the present time, partly owing to the extension of Turkish influence from Mokha and partly to the independent spirit engendered among these clans by the possession of rifles, although they acknowledge143 his suzerainty, it has became nominal only. Certain clans, such as the Mudariba and the Aghbari, still pay a small amount, or more probably offer 'entertainment' 2 only, while others (the Mishwali, Bokari) have of late years paid to the Turks through the Shaikh of the Durali. The Julaidi proper border on the Zuraiki on their (Julaidi) west, along the J. Iraf range, and on their north, along the Wadi Danuba, till the Buraimi are met near the Wadi Adim. Shawar is a village of some i dozen towers built on a hill above the Wadi Shawar, the Shaikh's being a large and well- built tower. There is a well below the village. The Buraimi, —Who border on the south Zuraiki territory for a short distance near the Wadi Adim consist of some four sections in all not exceeding 150 men, but, as with the Julaidi, there are several small tribes or clans, 'Ra'aya' or subjects of theirs, although practically independent at the present time, who inhabit country as far west as J. 'Akkar about 25 miles east of Mokha, but the northernmost clans have fallen under the influence of the Mokha authorities. The Buraimi proper live at Dar Mujaba and a few near Umm Fajra, the Khulaifi division of the Buraimi living at Umm Fajra itself, a small village with a tower, a few huts and a good well, at which the neighbouring nomads water their flocks. The country to the south consists of rolling sand hills, to the north, the range of hills of J. Musinna and Masna's and to the west, between Umm Fajra and the Wadi Adim, is an undu lating stony plain with many accacia thorn trees. The Bushbushi section live at the hamlet of 'All ba Jirjah in the Adim on the Zuraiki border, and the 'Utri, at Nassara and Dar SalTm Thabit, a couple of miles to the south. There is a little cultivation in the neighbourhood, but water is very scarce, the only well which produces any appreciable supply being Bir Majdura in Wadi Ma;dura, and that is brackish. The Buraimi are an ignorant people, to a great extent nomads, and covering long distances on their camels. In common with the other western tribes of the Subaihl, they seem much more peaceably disposed than the eastern tribes such as the Matarafi.144 The. Shurnaya. —Are a small clan living in Julaidi territory but now independent. They border on the Zuraiki in the Wadi Ubil, the boundary being just above their hamlet of Mijza-, which consists of two towers and some huts. There are dato- p.jms in the Wadi and cultivation, which they irrigate from a good stream coming from the Zuraihi country and ending just above Mijza. The* stream breaks forth again mile below Mijza and flows for about a mile. Umm Mijba and Umm Majarih are small hamlets with a little cultivation lower down the Wadi. From the Wadi 'Ubil on westwards, the inhabitants on either side of the border consist of small clans, on the Subaihi side living in either Atifi, Julaidi or Buraimi territory, in small valleys with a little cultivation frequently watered by small streams. Many of them were either originally, or have of later years assumed the character of, Sufis, a religious sect of which the founder is buried near Lahej, but which has branches in nearly the whole of South Yemen, Adh-Dhubbayat in the Amir of Dhala's and Shabwa in the Haushabi Sultan's country, being among their principal centres. This character confers certain advantages in the shape of immunity from tribal femds, and to a great extent from the payment of dues to the ruling Shaikh. Mudariba. —South of the Alkami (Turkish) and west of the Shumaya, separated from the latter by some 8 miles of stony and uncultivated country, are the small clan of Mudariba, in- 'habiting a fertile little valley traversed by the Wadi Umm Barhana, which, joining the Wadi Khosana, forms the Wadi Turan. The majority of the inhabitants are Sufis and occupy a clus- i;er of little hamlets, consisting of a tower and a few huts apiece, surrounded with date-palms and cultivation near the junction of the Wadis, whore a good stream springs forth and flows at intervals for some two miles along the Wadi Taran. There are also two wells, and a third well with poor supply and some small springs in the Wadi Umm Juail close by. is abundant. The people of Mudariba, adherents of the Julaidi Shaikh in whose territory their valley is, were found to be peace able and well-disposed. About 7 miles further down the Wadi Turan is the village of Umm Shat in Buraimi territory but also inhabited by Sufis145 It contains some 30 houses and stone huts, and is supplied by three good wells, one of which is nearly two miles up the WadI, one near, and one a little below the village. A stream, Ghail Rahban, rises in the Wadi about two miles below* on the road to Turan. The Ka'lull. —West of Mudariba in the Wadis Bitan and Ka'luli (also called W. Furrukhia and Umm Lasb) are a small tribe of some 200 men. The Wadi Bitan, of which the left bank is bounded by a rugged spur of Jabal Hawab, contains a good stream, Ghail Manobait, which flows for about a mile above the junction of Wadi Harhar, four wells and three or four towers at intervals, a few palm trees and a little cul tivation. There is a good spring in rocky pools in a nullah under Hawab, about a mile to the east of Dar Talib. There are very few inhabitants, among them some Sufis, the majority of the Ka'luli living in the wddl of that name separated from the Wadi Bitan by the ridge of J. Ahmad, crossed by a rough little pass, Barh Dhamka. The Wadi Ka'luli contains 6 or 7 small villages with 4 wells and good strips of cultivation. The best water-supply is a stream, Ghail Funkur, IJ miles below Bait Dmm Lasb, which contains good water and flows for about a mile. Lower down is another stream—Ghail Funi,—giving a good supply, but slightly brackish. A well about a mile below, Bir Sulaimani, is said to contain sweet water. A fair quantity of karbl, and ordinary native supplies in small quantities^ are procurable. The ArJcami,- —At the head of the Ka'luli Wadi, is a small valley at the south foot of J. Hawab inhabited by a small clan of about 20 men. There is a tower with a little cultivation near, and a well in a ravine about a mile to the south, only some 18 inches in diameter, and containing, when seen, about 100 feet of water. It was said by the inhabitants to yield a good supply. The road from the Wadi Bitan to the Haiki valley passes through this valley—Wadi Sudair—the passes leading in and out, though not high, have several very difficult bits for camels. Both the Ka'luli and the 'Arkami inhabit Buraimi terri tory. They are independent, at the present time, of the Bur aimi Shaikh. The ShubaiJcl. —A small nomad tribe in Buraimi territory; inhabit the desolate valley of the Wadi Tarbaha, to the west of the Wadi Ka'luli: it consists of a stony plain enclosed on C387GSB146 both sides by rocky and barren hills, Is intersected by nume* rous dry nullahs and covered with sparse vegetation afford- ino- grazing for the goats and sheep of the Shubaikl. Its aver age width'is about 2 miles. With the exception of Hisi Ah mad, a deep well with a very scanty supply of brackish water, there is no water between Ghail I'unf in the Wadi Ka'luli and Ghail Kulaita in Wadi Hurrim, a distance of about 8 miles. There is no cultivation nor are any supplies procurable on the spot. [Turbat -Abul-Asrar or Bani Surer, are a smull commu nity of Saiyids inhabiting a fertile little valley to the north east of the Hawab range. The shrine there is of some local renown. There is a small village with three wells of good water and a certain amount of cultivation, jowari and date-palm. It is as yet undecided whether this settlement will be included on the Turkish or the British side of the border though the land was originally Subailu. The valley adjoins that of Mud- ariba and fair tracks lead from it to the Wadi Bitan, to Umm Albia, and to the Haiki valley.] The Atijl. —The Atifi proper do not appear to number more than about 50 men, although their tribal limits extend south of the Buraimi from near Umm Fajra to Hawairib and the little group of Turan villages, their only fixed habitation, and along the coast from the Barhaimi border to Kuddam, north of Dubab. With the exception of a well about a mile east of Nubat Sayyaila (Sayyaila well is dry ) and a little cultivation near it, the whole of the southern portion is desert. Turan itself contains three fair wells and a stream, Ghail Hazaruf, not far up the Wadi Turan, and there is some cultivation near the villages. The Busaili, a small clan of Saiyids, live with the Atifi, at Turan. There are several clans living in Atifi territory to the north and along the coast. Of these the Mahwall or Hu are nomads who inhabit the neighbourhood of the Wadi Hurrim and the Sanfa range to the north-west. There is no cultivation in the Wadi Hurrim except at Umm Nabia but water is plentiful at intervals in spring pools, the most abundant being at Ghail Kulaita, where the track from Ras-ul-Ara to Karaba in the Haiki country, Strikes the Hurrim. 300 men and 400 camels were watered147 there in May before the rains, and produced no apparsnt dimi nution of the supply. The Wadi Hurrim is enoloaed by steep rocky banks for most of its course and below Ghaal Kulaita is very difficult for transport. The MaJchaya and the Bant Fatah. —Inhabit the lower part of the Wad! Hurrim, where it issues from the hills, near the hamlet of Umm Nabia, which consists of one stone tower and a few Karhi huts with a few acres of cultivation. There is a good well, and springs in the Wadi Hurrim about 2 miles abovo the hamlet. The Bani Fatah, who are Sufis, also own the wells of 'Uzzaf and Sukaya on the coast. They own a few riding camels and flocks of sheep and goats, with which they wander in search of pasture. The Jarthatl live near J. Wusid and J. Kharaz. About 2 miles north of J. Wusid is a narrow gorge, Ghail Barbar, containing a perennial rivulet, which fills a masonry tank in good repair, of a capacity of about 5,000 gallons once in 12 hours. There is a tower and a little cultivation, irrigated by this tank, a little below it. A fair well—Hisi I ara—exists about 2| miles off, just to the south of J. Wusid. The Boundary Commis sion and supporting column, some 800 men and 500 animals in all, were camped for two days at Ghail Barbar, and good water was procured in sufficient quantity with reasonable economy from the spring and well. A wing of a Native Infantry regiment camped there for several weeks and obtained sufficient forage for their camel transport. Some cultivation exists at Ad-Didia a few miles south of J. Wusid. Throughout the Atifi country, the men, in the proportion of about 2 out of 3, were armed with breech-loaders, the remain^ der carrying spears or swords. They appeared perfectly peav.0- ful and well disposed, and under normal circumstances, a small escort of ten to twenty sowars would probably be sufficient. The tribes enumerated above include practically all the Subailii clans of any importance with the exception of the Barhemi, who inhabit the sea-coast, east of Jabal Kharaz ana who are from all accounts a fairly well behaved section, noma a for the most part, and the Rijai of Umm Rija numbering about 70 men.148 The latter are, mainly from their geographical position, in constant communication with the Sultan of Lahej. A tabulated statement (A) is appended shewing the locali ties of the various sections (with the exception of the two last named) and an estimate of the number of fighting men of each as far as it could be obtained from local information and observation. A statement (B), shewing the treaty engagements existing with, and the stipends and presents payable to, the various sections. STATEMENT A. Suhaihl tribes in proximity to the Turkish border.

Radhum, with some 800 inhabitants. Other villages in ^ahldf territory are Ras-ij|rKJalb, &gt;'Ali, Balahaf, and lias-ul-Majdaha. The population of Ras-ijl-Kalb is estimated at 2,000. Bir-'AU and Balahaf contain very few in habitants. The harbour of Bir 'All is a small circular and, safe bay, 1 mile long by broad, exposed to winds from the south. The total population is estimated at over 9,000 souls, besides a sprinkling of Jews and Hadhramis. The Wahid! are one of the least aggressive tribes in the country and have for the most part settled down into peaceful tillers of the soil, or herdsmen, tending their camels, goats, and sheep. There are no men of wealth in the country and the general equality of fortune i? very noticeable, except as regards the Jews. These are industrious, but very poor: they are not allowed to own land and are chiefly artisans, while theii; wpmen rear poultry. The population may be divided broadly into two classes— the settled agricultural and the Bedpuij^s. The latter subsist on their camels, goats, etc., and what they can get from the Sultan and travellers. There are no nomads. A savage custom exists among the Bedouins of never accepting the 6 diya y or blood money. Tho higher Shaikhs, and nxost of tfre Sharifs can read and write but the rest of the population is illiterate. The inhabitants, as seen in Al-Hauta, are taller, fairer, and more slender than the ordinary Arabs, and wear their long, curling hair loose, or fastened behind with a band. Ignorant and superstitious, they are consequently bigoted and fanatical, yet by no means strict Muslims, very lax in religious duties, neglecting their daily prayers, except on Fridays* The women are very fair, with a slight yellowish tint, and go about ^nyeiled, th^e^r hair being worn in long ringlets round the head. The ordinary food of the people consists of coarse jowan or bajri bread, with ghee and dates. Very little rice is consumed The only beverage is Icishor, an infusion of coffee beans and husks* x2 ; l I H h156 Inhabiting Ar-Raudha in the northern Wahldi country are the Haiuk, an inferior caste of Arabs engaged in weaving. The following are sub-tribes of the Wahidi:— (1) Bil-laksar. (5( Ahl'Umm-bin-'AH. (2) Habtur. (6) Ahl Khadar. (3) Aswad. (7) Ahl'Othaiman. (4) Harizi. (8) Ba Kutmi. Upper7 afci'l. The Yafa'i are Himyaritic in origin with the exception of a few border clans who have come from the north and have gadually become affiliated. The Yafa'i were formerly under the Imams of San'a, but they revolted about the end of the Seventeenth century and became independent. They are now perhaps one of the most powerful tribes in Yemen. The total fighting strength of the Upper Yafa'i is estimated at over 15,000 men. The five clans of the Upper Yafa'i are— 1. Mausata .. 3. Mafiahi 2. Ad-Dhubi .. 4. Bo'si 5. Da'udI Besides these there are the connected tribe of the ShaibI, of Yafa origin, and the district of Ar-Rub'atain. I. The Mausata are the most powerful clan and are situated in the centre of Yafa'i to the east of the Wad! Bana and in the valley of the Wadi Hatib, a tributary of the Bana. Their total fighting strength is estimated at 8,000 men. The chiefship of the Mausata clan is in what is known as the Bani-Naqib family of Ahl l Askar 'AH, whose headquarters are at the town of Al-Kudma. The section of the Mausata clari are— 1. Yaslami. 6.

The section of Ratuan-ush-Shaiwahi live in Al-Had in a village of that name near the border of the Ahl Humaikani, a tribe under a rule of 'Amm-Rasas. 15. The Section of Na'wa live in that town which lies to the north of Rub'atain. The population of Na'wa is about 4,000 souls, and they are said to muster 500 fighting men. Ar- Razaim is a village under Na'wa. 16. The section of Jubani live in the town and district of Juban with 4,000 inhabitants. Their sections are— (1) Waisi. (5) Yahan. (2) Ishaki. (6) Ma'athi. (3) Darhanii. (7) Hanjari. (4) Qadhi. (8) Thuwairi. The district of Juban is divided equally amongst the Shaikhs of the two families, or houses. Those of the houses of Ishak own half and those of the house of 'Abdul Rub the other half. II. The second clan of the Upper Yafa'i in importance and num bers is the Dhubi. Their territory is the southern portion and they are bounded on the south by the Lower Yafa'i, on the east by the country of Umm Rasas, on the west by the Bo'sl clan, and on the north by the Mausata and the Dabiani. The total fighting strength of the Dhubi is about 5,000 men. The Shaikh of the Dhubi lives in the town of Dhi Surah and his authority extends over the whole clan, with the exception of the Hadhrami, who are practically independent. It ia divided into seven principal sections—• (1) Surri. (4) As-Su'aidi. (2) Sharafi. (5) At-Taffi. (3) Aa-Salahi. (6) As-Saili. (7) Al-HadhramLT BjU^ '4 I i I I I 5 .. i 165 The total fighting strength of the Muflahis is estimated at 5,000 men. IV. The Bo'si are a smaller clan than any of the preceding, their total population is estimated at about 2,000 souls, and the num ber of their fighting men at 500. The Bo'si country is flat plain intersected by small valleys, the principal of which is the Wadi-ul-Ab'us. The Bo'si clan are bounded on the north by the Mausata clan, on the east by the HadhramI section of the Dhubi clan, on the south by the Dhubi clan and on the west by the ISaqibi sec tion of the Yazadi clan of the Lower Yafa'i.

The Da'udi clan live in a district known as Al-Had, which ia bounded on the north and east by Al-Hamra of the Bai a country, on the west by the Khulaka section of the Mausata clan, and on the south by the Dhubi clan. There are said to be no mountains in tlie Da udi country.167 The Bam Kais section live in the town of Ban! Kais. The Rafai Tarika section (originally from Upper Egypt) occupy the villages: (1) Kharba. (2) Arash. VII. The Shaibi clan is a large one whose connection with the main clans of the Upper Yafa'i is somewhat indefinite, consisting mainly of a doubtful claim by the Naqibs of the Mausata to tribute and military assistance from the Shaibi. The total population of the Shaibi is estimated at about 10,000 souls, and their total fighting strength at about 2,500 men. The approximate boundaries of their territories are on the west the districts of Marais ; on the north Rub'atain; on the east Dabiani, Raw, and the Muflahi; on the south-west the Mufiahi of Khalla ; and on the south-east the Halmin tribe. The country is a high and broad mountain ridge with deep valleys draining north and east to the River Bana. The head Shaikh of the clan resides at the town of Bakhal; population 1,000. He has control of the following villages :— Population. (1) Yafhul .. .. ..50 (2) Katid.. .. .. .. 300 (3) Halaj .. .. .. 100 (half belongs to another Shaikh). B3sides the head Shaikh, there are nine others of importance whose villages are as follows :— 1. (1) Dhi Kania. (4) Amlah. (2) Al-Kaddam. (5) Ath-Thijr. (3) An-Nusaiba. (6) Al-Hahl, 2. (1) Anfad.

All the above seven villages are situated in Sailat-Dhi-Naqib, The Naqibi can muster about 400 fighting men. (2) Madik. (3) Rahwah. (5) Humhuma, (6) Mudedha,173 CHAPTER IV, Resources. Agriculture, —Agriculture claims the attention of a large proportion of the inhabitants of the British Protectorate. Un promising as the country looks, the fertility of the mountain valleys and slopes, and the alluvial tracts near the streams and rivers, is surprising. Immense pains are taken throughout to secure'any possible irrigation; water rights are the most fre quent cause of inter-tribal strife. In the mountains, where the crops are dependent on the rainfall, great ingenuity is often displayed in leading the ram-water round a hill to a particu lar field to be watered. From the rivers, frequent irrigation channels carry off the water, while the smaller streams are divert ed to the fields. The staple food stuff of the country is millet (Sorghum) either 'dhirra', (jowari), or 'dukhn,' (bajri). Of the dhirra, there are several varieties:— ' Resl, ?? a white jowari, ' Gharib 'a coarse red jowari, chiefly used for feeding cattle, ' Saumi™ a red jowari of a better kind than Gharib. The roots of the Saurril are left in the ground to sprout again and three crops are often obtained from one sowing. The time of sowing varies of course in different dis tricts, the spring and autumn generally being the chief times for sowing. With the exception of Sauml which is sown in the autumn, all the above are sown in the spring in the higher districts. The crops take about four months to ripen. ' Seyali' {China) is also grown in the Tiban valley; it is a fine millet* Other cereals grown are maize or Indian corn, called by the Arabs either ' Hind n or 'Seri\ This is apparently some times irrigated, and sometimes not. Grown entirely by irrigation are, 'Bur' a bearded wheat, and barley {Shcfir). ' Dijr, ' a species of vetch, seems to grow at any time; and is sown among the dhirra&gt; or dtikhn. It is used for cattle food, and in the Subaihi county is largely the fodder given to riding camels. There are several kinds of pea, Helha tf &amp;nd u Attar ' growA in the autumn, and used chiefly as a cattle174 food, and ''Dal, ' grown in the spring, &lt;c Jiljil ^ (sesamum) a small oleaginous plant and u Tartar' mustard seed, are used for making oilcake. Dates are grown in large quantities in the Wadl Ma'adin and in the SuJbaihi valleys, westwards to wards the coast. Those not required for home consumption are exported : contractors from Aden buying the crop on the tree. They are also grown in the 'Aulaki country, but not to the same extent. Onions of small size but fair quali ty, and leeks, are also grown. Potatoes of excellent quality were obtainable in Dhala, being imported from Turkish Yemen. Coffee is not grown in large quantities in the British Protec torate, the best coming from the Turkish side of the border. Some, however, is grown in Yafa, the Halmin and Kotaibi val leys, and a little near Dhala. Kat n is an irrigated crop, on which much labour is ex pended. Some, but not very much, is grown in British terri tory. Indigo is chiefly grown in the neighbourhood of Baihan and the northern ? Aulald country; it is largely imported into other districts and is the staple dye for clothes. ' Warns' bastard saffron, is grown, chiefly on J. Jahaf, and is exported to Aden. Cotton is grown in Baihan and the northern 'Aulaki country. In the higher regions the climate and soil are well adapted to European vegetables, most of which were grown in Dhala successfully. Supplies, —Broadly speaking none of the districts in the British Protectorate produce more cereal food stuffs than are required for the consumption of the inhabitants^ taking good years with bad. This applies particularly to the majority of the country, which is non-irrigated and dependent on the rainfall. The district of lahej can be depended on for larger quanti ties than other districts, as it has the advantages of irriga tion. During the occupation of Dhala in 1903, it was found im possible to supply the mules of the 2 mountain batteries with forage locally. The two Turkish districts, of Yubi and Haik in close proximity to the Amiri country and with a level roadfor transport, produce a quantity of jowari, but the probabi lity of Turkish interference discounts their value. It is as well to note that the Turkish country, practically all along the border, is most fertile, and that the tribes on the British side, often obtain their supplies thence, when their own crops fail. The sequel to our purchase of grain in Dnala was that the har vest of 1903, proving a failure, the people who h^d sold most of their grain reserve, h^d some difficulty in suplying their wants, and in the ensuing winter and spring, had to pay exorbitant rates and import grain. Transport is also a difficulty throughout, in obtaining supplies from a distance, as the people, in the case of an ex pedition of any size, will have hired out thoir camols, ^nd un less camels are supplied by the troops wanting the supplies, there is a great difficulty in getting thom in. In the Haushabi country, there is no difficulty in getting grain and forage in moderate quantities, but for a large force, Lahej, and other neighbouring districts, would have to be drawn on, as the cultivation in the western portion is mostly in the restricted Tiban bed. The Fadhli country contains a very fertile tract between the Banaand Hasan. It is not apparently as much cultivated as it might be, and the standing dispute between thu Fadhli and Lower Yafa'i above referred to, introduces an element of uncertainty as to the yield to be expected at any given sea son. The Subaihi country is entirely barren in its eastern and southern portions, but a fertile tract is found near the Wadi Ma'adio which compares favourably with other districts. No difficulty was found in supplying some 800 camels with forage during March and April, and the markets were well supplied with native food-stuffs at moderate rates. The valleys westwards, thence to the coast, were, as a rule, fertile, and some 600 camels were supplied with forage with out any difficulty. The staple forage for animals is, universally, the stalks and leaves of the dhirra and duJchn, During the Kotaibi expedition in October and November, the Bujair and Mazra' valleys were covered with excellent dhirra and dukhn crops. Some 600 camels, and the mules of176 a mountain battery and transport mules, were freely supplied with forage. Much was also destroyed, but even then, whole fields remained standing. It is worth nothing for similar expeditions that the Arab, in case of hostilities, invariably buries his grain, either in a ' mad fan n or deep grainpit, or under the manure heaps near the villages, the grain being sewn in bag or matting. These are carefully concealed and often hard to discover, but they repay a little investigation. The Shaibi valleys and Ruba'tain, and by all accounts Yafa also, are fertile. Bearded wheat and barley are chiefly grown. It is impossible to estimate the amount of forage available, but it does not seem likely that a very large quanti ty would be procurable, while if the Yafa'i were hostile, it would be difficult to obtain. At the same time, in the case of an advance along the Sailat Sih, on the north-western Yafa border, the districts to the north-west, which are by all accounts fer tile, might be tapped. But too little is known of the local conditions to say anything for certain. According to Mr. Bury's account, dhirra is sown in Dahr and the Upper 'Aulaki country in May and in Dathina and other districts, south of the Kaur-ul-Audilla, in October, and ripens in four months. Dulchn is chiefly grown in Dathina in May. Dijr is grown in Dathina and ' Kadh n a species of clover in Dahr, and Upper 'Aulaki, and occasional good grass is found. Grass is, as a rule, very scanty, and imported compressed bales were almost always necessary. Commerce. —The greater proportion of the trade in the districts under British protection, more especially in the wes tern portion, is a transit trade from Turkish Yemen, from which coffee, ' Kat 52 and skins, in large quantities, are ex ported, and to which in return, kerosene oil, clothes, tobacco, etc., are imported; the districts, through which these commo dities pass, obtaining their revenue from transit dues, guaran teeing the safety of caravans, etc. Hides are the principal export from Dhala and the neighbouring districts^ as also, with the addition of dates, from the Subaihi. The coast towns from Aden eastwards do a considerable trade in sharks' fins and dried fish generally. These are largely exported to .the East by the sea, as also into the interior of the Hadhramauir.177 Dried fish are curiously enough often used as food for camels^ especially on the east coast, towards the Hadhramaut. Honey is an article largely exported from Yeshbum and the Hadhramaut generally. Much attention is also paid to apiculture in the western part of the Protectorate, but the ex port does not seem anything like so considerable as from the eastern districts. Frankincense, gum, and attar of roses are also exported from the Hadhramaut, while the imports are chiefly kerosene, cloths, hardware, etc. Breech-loading rifles and carbines, and ammunition are imported especially via Ras-ul-Ara, and favourable landing places between Shaikh Said and Aden, and some are said to filter through Turkish Yemen, being landed on the Red Sea eoast, but it would seem that the larger quantity is imported direct. Grain, especially jowari, is imported to Aden from India, and, in times of failure of crops, to the interior. ludustTics. Of these there are not many. Hides are rough- lydressed for export. Rough black-smith's work is done, such as simple repairs to arms and agricultural implements. Weav ing of a plain kind of cloth is carried on by Jews, better tex- tures of more elaborate design come from Yafa, while the nom adic tribes to the north and east weave a kind of irug, and the black cloth of rough texture used for tents. -cloths, both with the indigo and a green dye obtained from a tree, is carried on locally. Matting of palm fibre is made almost universally. Carpentring is of a rough nature : doors and their frames, and agricultural implements are the usual articles made. Powder is manufactured both by Jews and Arabs ; it is of a coarse kind, and usually used for the matchlock, but reload ing and recapping solid-drawn catridgesis carried on in Dhala, and probably in other places as well. Masonry is of a good, solid kind; the blocks of stone are well trimmed azid either built in with mortar, or, in more simple buildings, the crevices are filled in with small fragments of stone. Throughout the more mountainous country, stone, a kind of granite, excellent for building, is plentiful. In the plain towns mud-bricks are frequently used. •CS87GSB 2a178 Generally spoaking, manufactures are only sufficient for, and intended to supply, the simple needs of the inhabitants. Labour, except in Aden and the coast towns, centres to which those in search of employment migrate, is scarce and difficult to obtain, as well as expensive. In several cases, which came under notice in the Wadi Ma'adin, the most thickly populated part of the Subaihi country, for building towers and repairing wells, workmen wero brought from Turkish territory. Hajiris and analogous classes are often employed, but they are not nume rous. The experiment has not been tried in the interior, but it would seem that anything in the shape of a coolie corps from local Arabs would be unobtainable. Camels. —Camels are the universal beast of burden through out the country. They are smaller in size than the Indian camel and lighter in build, suggesting rather an inferior riding camel, than a regular breed of baggage animal. There are several varieties, but they may be divided generally into hill camels and plain camels. The former are exceedingly active and sure-footed, and their feet wear wonderfully well on the stony ground. Few can carry a 400 lbs. load, 300. lbs. would be about the average load for both hill and plain camels, and in very steep and mountainous country they will not take more than 2001bs. With a light load they will ascend rough slopes of 6° to 8° for a limited distance. Nearly all the camels employed during 1902-4 were hired and accompanied by their owners. On the whole they did fair ly well; the mortality was not great, and no large numbers broke down. The expeditions in which they were used, though the ground traversed was often very trying, did not give con tinuous marching enough to try them very highly, but the majority had been in hard work between Aden and Dhala previously. The Arab camel has, however, two very great disadvan tages as a transport animal: he is accustomed to being watered every day, and will barely go more than two days without water at a pinch and he is used to being hand fed with jowari fodder, and when in work, the owner never seems to let him graze. This is sometimes inevitable, as good grazing is scarce in many bill tracts, but excellent grazing was met with at times in the SubaihT country and though forage was very scarce, pressure had to be put on the men to graze their animals. The only179 camels observed grazing freely were she-camels with young and camels out of work. There is no doubt the camel would graze freely, if allowed to, and would be all the better for it. With regards to numbers, it is difficult to make any esti- mate. Large numbers are engaged in the carrying trade, and judging by the loads, they were also the best specimens: 800 was the utmost, the camel-contractor at Dhala estimated he could get from the Amiri country, and this number included some from Turkish Yemen. In fact, throughout, camels were brough% in for hire from the Turkish districts, a large black animal being a noticeable variety. It would be fairly safe to say that 1,500 to 2,000 workable animals would be the outside that one could expect to collect with a month's notice for any given expedition. The riding camel is very active and capable of great en durance, The best are obtained from Lahej and the Subaihi country. The Subaihi begin riding them very young, but they take good care of them and they grow into strong animals. They are good trotters and capable of hard work. Their feet l^st surprisingly well on stony ground. Some baggage camels purchased by the Commission, and carefully looked after, turned into fine strong animals and easily carried their 400 lbs. day after day. The nomad clans of the 'Aulaki own riding camels, but no details are available as to numbers. Horses. —Horses in the Protectorate are a negligible quanti ty. With the exception of the nomad tribes on the northern border, only the chief men are in possession of them. Small numbers are brought for sale from Jauf, but they are as a rule coarse bred animals. Donkeys.- —Are fairly numerous and of a strong but small breed. They carry loads up to about 120 lbs. Cattle. —Are of a good stamp, both plough and slaughter oxen and milch-cows. The milch-cows occasionally are parti cularly good. No difficulty was experienced in obtaining enough oxen to supply the British troops in Dhala (1,000 men) during the year they were&gt; there. Sheey and goats. —Are plentiful throughout. The sheep make good mutton, but they are small, and it was found more economical to feud the troops on Somali sheep marched from 2a2180 Aden. They are specially numerous among nomadic tribes like the Subaihi. The goats give a good yield of milk. In time of peace there would be no difficulty in obtaining good numbers of both if necessary. In case of hostility among the inhabitants,, they drive their flocks off to the hills and capture Would, as a rule, be difficult. Chickens and Small in size, obtainable throughout. Wood and Tree*. In the desert tracts and maritime plain, thorn |rees of the acacia family grow in fair profusion. The river-beds are r as a rule, lined with tamarisk; date-palms are common in the lower valleys to the west, as well as doiu palms, which are found in valley^ near the coast and in small quantities near the shore. The 46 halas, n an edible green fig, and various kinds of bastard fig, are common. Jumper trees grow in profusion on ranges towards the south-west and on the Juhaili hills. The most tiseful tree is on the whole the ' ulub,' or Indian 44 Ber'^ tree, which is universal in the cultivated portion. The leaves are used as fodder for camels and domestic animals and the tree is considered as private property. The fruit called 44 dom? 7 ' a small berry with a stone, not unlike a crab apple, is eaten by the Arabs, and the wood is strong and suited for building. Good camel grazing is afforded by the 46 Ealc 11 (Indian fileu), 44 asJiak n and several varieties of mimosa. Aden. All supplies are imported; fuel, vegetables, and fodder come from Lahej, beef and mutton from Somaliland, and all cereals from India. A reserve of slaughter cattle sufficient for fifteen days for the garrison is always kept in stock, as also 25,000 tins of meat. The total live stock available in Aden varies, but perhaps 200 bullocks, 350 cows, and 1,100 sheep and goats is a fair average. The following live stock might be obtained from the Hin terland if the people were friendly r— In one week, 50 cattle, 1,000 sheep and goats. lo a fortnight, 100 cattle, 2000 sheep and goats. The water supply of Aden is obtained from condensers? the aqueduct, the reservoirs^ and wells.181 There are three condensers at Steamer Point, and one at Sira Island. Working at full pressure they could produce 40,000 gallons a day for 10 or 12 days; but for a long period only an output of 27,500 gallons a day could be maintained. The aqueduct, which was built in 1867 at a cost of Rs. 170,7005 provides only brackish water, which is drunk by Arabs and Somalis and by animals. Horses and mules accustomed to this water will not drink condensed water unless a little sea water is added to it. There are numerous wells, but the best of these together furnish only about 1,800 gallons of brackish water a day, while the water from the others is only fit for washing purposes. The reservoirs furnish an irregular supply of rain water which only Arabs and Somalis will touch. The transport available in Aden consists of 1 motor lorry, 50 motor cars, 334 draught camols, 611 pack camels, 188 bul locks, 399 horses and ponies, 172 pack donkeys. In addition, there might be collected from the Hinterland :— In one week, 500 camels, 30 donkeys. In a fortnight, 1,000 camels, 60 donkeys. There am usually 100,000 tons of coal in stock. Perim. A considerable stock of supplies is maintained for sale to passing ships by the Persian Coal Company, which also main tained a stock of Welsh coal varying from 5,000 to 15,000 tons, of which 800 to 1,000 tons is always ready on lighters. There are water condensers near the harbour which fur nish all the requirements of the island as well as of the ship ping. Soqotra. Amongst the natural products of the island, the first rank is due to the aloe, for which the island has been celebrated from time immemorial. It grows wild on the summits and sides of the limestone mountains at an elevation of from 500 to 3,000 feet, and appears to thrive best in parched and barren places. The other products are dragons-blood and diites182 the latter supplying the inhabitants with one of their chiof articles of food. Jowari is the only grain cultivated, and beans, melons, and a little tobacco are grown in the gardens attached to the houses. There are also a few patches of cotton and indigo, and wild oranges and yams are met with in the granite mountains. There are no trees fit for building purposes; the metayne, however, a shrub rather than a tree, which abounds through out the island, is as hard as lignum vitce* The only domesticated animals are camels, oxen, sheep, goats, and fowls. The ass, which used to be the beast of bur den before the arrival of the camels, now roams over the plain, south of Tamridah, in troops of ten to twelve. Camels were estimated in 1886 at about 200 and cows in 1835 at about 1,200. Dogs and horses are unknown. Cows are kept principally for the sake of milk and are only killed on the death of some person of position. Sheep are found all over the island and goats are even more numerous. There is a pearl fishery off Tamridah, carried on by divers from 'Oman. Aloes, ghi, dragons-blood, tanned hides, and pearls constitute the only articles of export, and dates and stuffs are imported. Ghi constitutes the standard of value, but dollars and rupees are taken, to be converted into ear rings for the women. The revenue has been estimated at about 600 dollars a yea&amp; * Ab doll. The area under cultivation cannot exceed two-fifths of the whole territory. In the rich oases red and white jowari are grown, besides sesamum, karbi, vegetables, grass, and a little cotton. Near Al- Hauta are groves of date palms and wild almond trees. The fertile tract between the two branches of the Tiban supplies Aden with grass, forage, wood, and vegetables ; but it could not meet any very heavy extra call. 'AJcrabl. Jowari and karbi are the chief crops, but they cannot be very abundant as the revenue of the Chief from these sources only amounts to 200 dollars a year in ordinary years- The183 Khahtor desert tract, on the frontier of the ' Abdali territory, though uncultivated, produces wood, potash, and forage for camels. *Alawt. White and red jowari as well as hajri are grown. Cattle, sheep, and goats are reared to a small extent. Near the Sailat Hardaba it is estimated that 1,000 acres are under cultivation. Amtr of Dhdlas torritory. Agriculture. —Bare and rocky as the mountains of the Amir of Dhab's country are, 1 he fertility of the'intervening valleys is often surprising. In nearly all these valleys where the slopes are not too steep, there is a deposit of rich alluvial soil, and it is in some parts spread over a wide extent. Every available foot of such ground is carefully cultivated, the earth being retained by a series of terraces. All the staple crops of the country are rain-crops, and in order to utilise to the utmost the uncertain and often scanty rain fall every hillside and every undulation of the ground is drained in the required direction by water channels, simply construct ed of loose stones or pebbles. The plough oxen are of a good powerful breed. Crops. —The chief crops are millets, viz,, Dhirra, corresponding to the Indian Jowari, and jjukhn, the Indian Bajra. In the spring are sown Eesi, a white jowari ; Gharib, a coarse red jowari, chiefly used for feeding cattle; Dukhn, a fine mil let which* grows in a bulrush-shaped head, Dal, a small pea, and jiljil (sesamum) from the seeds of which oil is extracted in wooden mills of simple construction worked by camels. All the above are harvested in October, in the highlands, and somewhat earlier in the low valleys. The following are sown in autumn and harvested about March. Sauml, a red Jowari of finer quality than Gharib. Helba r a kind of pea chief!v used as food for cattle and camels. Attar, also a pea. Indian-corn, called Hind or Sen by the Arabs; Sha'ir, barley, and Bur, bearded wheat. The last three are only grown as a rule in places where irri gation is possible, and are therefore only produced in small quantities.184 The roots of Saumi are left in the ground to sprout again, and three crops are often obtained from one sowing. Seyall, a fine millet, known in India as is grown large ly in the Tiban valley. Little grain is exported as there is seldom much in excess of the requirements of the population. Pedder. —The leaves ot Dhirra and called are used as fodder for cattle, and the stalks for camels and horses. The finer dhirra stalks are the best. A fairly plentiful supply is obtainable provided that trans port is available to bring it in from a distance. It was how ever insufficient for the needs of the troops in 1903, when there were two mule batteries, besides several hundred camels. There is a fair amount of good ' ' grass on the Dhala plain after the rain. Kdt.—Kdl is an irrigated crop on the production of which much labour is expended. It grows in bushes not unlike small tea bushes, two or three feet high. The tender leaves and shoots are chewed while still fresh by every Arab, who can afford the luxury There are many plantations on the Dhala highlands, at about 4,000 to 5,000 feet, and it grows a good deal higher, the best being said to be that which comes from Tai'zz. It is found at about 3,000 feet in the Tiban valley, and that is probably the lowest elevation at which it will grow well. Coffee.—GoSee is only grown in small quantities ; the climate appears to be not so suitable as in other parts of Yemen. There are a few small plantations in the neighbourhood of Dhala; in sheltered valleys on Jabal Jahaf, in the valleys east of Jabal Harlr, and in some of the valleys of the Radfan mountains. The Arabs themselves prefer coffee made from the husk (qashr) to coffee made from the berry Fruit and Vegetables. —There is a very little fruit grown in Dhala territory, but grapes of very fair quality are brought in from the Marais hills, both white and purple; the best were white with no noticeable seeds. There are also obtainable figs, apricots, peaches, pomegTanates, melons, and limes. Plantains are grown in the Radfan Mountains.185 Potatoes of good quality are obtainable in large quantities from Yemen, and tomatoes are grown at Ka'taba and elsewhere. Onions, leeks, radishes, etc., are grown in enclosed and irrigated gardens. Most English vegetables will flourish at Dhala if well watered. Wood and Trees —Most of the valleys are well wooded; notably the Wadi .Hardaba, the Wad! Ka'taba, the Wadi Haza, and the Wadi-ul-Azrak so that firewood is always plentiful provided that transport is available. The commonest tree is the 4 Ulh? the Indian 4 Ber* Its yellow berries called 'domS are eaten by the people, the young branches are lopped off/to feed goats and camels, or to form hedges round the fields; it affords good timber and fuel and is highly valued by the Arabs. The frequent lopping of bran ches stunts their growth, but fine spreading trees, 40 to 50 feet in height, are not uncommon. There are several kinds of Ficus; the 4 Suhum ' which corre sponds to the Indian Daman. The ' BalasJ the edible green fig, the ' TolakS a fine tree, the best specimens of which are at Adh-Dhubayya,t; and others. One of the commonest trees is the c Athab ' (Indian Timur), from the inner bark of which the fatila, or tinder slow match, is made. It is also a ficus, tho'ugh like a willow in appearance. There are many kinds of Acacia, the Sumar, which corre sponds to the Indian Babul, and others known as the Ashrah Sarrahi, Duba, etc. Tamarisk (Aihal) is common both in the valleys, and in the form of low scrub on the Dhala plain. Stunted date palms (NaJchla) are found in some valleys and mats are made from their leaves. There are several kinds of aloe; the commonest is a hand some red-flowering variety. Stones —Quarries near Dhala and in many other parts afford a practically unlimited supply of excellent stone for building purposes. It is granite, grey or reddish. The Arabs are skilful in quarrying the stone by blasting, and squaring it in blocks for building their 6 ddrs 5 or stone towers There are outcrops of lime in many parts of tlie hills. C387GSB 2b186 _ Bee-ketfing.—The Arabs pay much attention to bee-keep- mg Honey of good quality is produced, that from the small yellow flower of the ' kassas ' cactus is said to be the best. Br arrangement between the villagers the hives are moved from the valleys up into the mountains and accord- dmg to the seasons when the plants most frequented bv bees are m bloom. The hives are loaded on camels for the purpose. The transit trade between Aden and Yemen is the chief source of wealth to the inhabitants of Dhala territory. A large portion of them own camels which they let on hire. The chief contractors for caravans are the BasaisI, a clan settled in Dhala territory, whose head Shaikh, lives at Al-Minadi 8 miles north of Dhala. , Little is exported from Dhala besides hides and skins the preparation of which is the chief industry in Dhala town itself. Imports from Aden are kerosene oil, spun yarn, cloths, tobacco, salt, dates, spices and many sundries. Imports from Yemen are coffee, grain, earthenware, etc. Market. Dhala town is the centre of a considerable local trade. The weekly market on Thursday is attended by people from every direction. On a well-attended market day the numbers coming in were counted and found to be approximately as follows-— men 2,300, camels 480, cattle 100, donkeys 450, sheep and goats 550. These numbers are exclusive of those already in Dhala and numerous arrivals over night. The attendance is much smaller at the season, at which agriculture claims the atten- tion of the people. _ A weekly market held every Tuesday at Al-Husain, 10 miles north of Dhala, is nearly as largely attended as that of Dhaia itself. The dealings at these bazaars are chiefly in live stock, grain, coffee, kerosine oil, and cloths. Industries —Weaving is' done exclusively by Jews They only m&amp;ke cotton cloths of the plainest texture. The only artificers are also Jews. Their apphances are the simplest, and, as blacksmiths, or silversmiths, they only pro duce the plainest work. All fine work cornea from Yemen187 or from Lahej. The Jews of-Dhala and Habil-ul-Jilb make gunpowder, and reload and recap cartridges. Camels. —The camels, though smaller than good Indian camels, are fairly good. Those bred in the country, b3ing usxi to the rocky hill country, are far preferable for work in the country of Dhaia and its neighbourhood to camels brought from the plain country of Lahej. The maximum load should not be calculated at more than 300 lbs. About 100 camels can be collected at Dhala at any time at two or three days' notice, and given longer time and suffi cient inducement from 600 to 800 could be collected from all the Amir's territory and 200 or 300 more from over the Turkish border. Cattle, —There is a very good breed of cattle. They are not used for transport, but the best of the plough oxen are fine powerful animals. Donkeys. —Donkeys are numerous. Though small, they are of a good type. They are active and surefooted in the hills, and they bring in loads of 120 lbs. and more from consider able distances to the Dhala bazaar. A large number could be hired. Horses and Mules. —There are very few horses or mules in the Dhala country. Only the principal Shaikhs ride horses. The few horses that are brought in to Dhala from the country of Job, 200 miles to the north, are coarse bred animals of an inferior type. Sheep and Goats. —Sheep and goats are kept in large numbers by all the tribes. The goats are of a good breed, but the sheep are very poor; they are of a fat-tailed variety, with coarse fleeces of reddish hair. Large flocks are kept in the Wadi Ka'taba, in the Dak- kam country, and in the southern Azraki country. There is no wheeled traffic in the Amir o £ Dhala's territory. The narrow roads only admit of pack trans port on camels or donkeys. 2B2190 'Aulahl. A large extent of the 'Aulaki country is under cultivation and there are numerous flocks of sheep and goats and herds of camels in the extensive pastures. The ? Aulaki possess a fine breed of horses and are the only tribe in these parts that poss ess any. Millet, wheat, and jowari are grown in the low lands; tahaf and Kinib (qinnab) (hemp), inferior grains, in the hilly districts. Salt mines are found in the neighbourhood of Nasab, the capital of the Upper 'Aulakfs territory. The sidr tree abounds in this region. It grows to a height of from 20 to 50 feet and is used for fuel and for making huts, while its fruit, called nabak, is eaten by men and cattle. Baidd.

For resources of this district see details given against the various tribes in chapter III, ' Population. 15 Fadhll. The low lands of Abyan, where the alluvium is not covered by drift sand, is very fertile, producing an abundant yield of red and white jowari, and sesamum. Among the hills to the north-west some wheat is raised in addition to jowari, while myrrh trees, the produce of which is gathered by Somalis, grow in abundance on the limestone heights. The valley of the Yeramis is estimated to yield 150,000 lbs. of jowari. At Al-Kawr, in the Abyan country north of the Al-Kadam range, are irrigation works watering 1,000 acres of land. There are said to be 4,000 camels, 10,000 sheep and goats, and 500 cattle in the Fadhli territory. Haushabl. The country is on the whole a poor one. Fourteen hund red acres are said to be under cultivation, chiefly in the bed191 of the Tiban, where jowari is grown. On the hiljs are bushes of habul and rakh: the latter furnishes grazing for camels. Cattle, sheep, and goats are reared, and camels are said to be fairly plentiful. RcCaiti, Antimony and deposits of guano are met with, and there are sulphur springs at Shehr, Dia and Hami. The coast district is well cultivated. Mukalla, the capital, is supplied with water from Al-Ba- karain, some four miles distant. Kasddl, The arable land between the chains of hills is estimated at about 8,000 acres. Date palms and trees abound tobacco is cultivated, and there are considerable numbers of camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep, and goats, SubaiM. For resources of the Subaihi, see details given against the tribe m Chapter III, ' Population.' Wahldl. In the vicinity of the Wadi Haifa' near Hauta wheat, ba ? n, barley, and tahaf are grown. Four crops are reaped year- ly, namely, one rain crop and three irrigation. The fields are neat and regular and the state of cultivation eenerallv ® u P er ^ or - The rotation of crops is observed. The Wadi is bunded for irrigation by numerous stone walls. ' There is an abundant supply of good water which is drawn ud bv bullocks after the Indian system. No fruits are grown excent dates and lemons. The few cattle are sent to graze in the neieh bounng deserts under the care of Bedouins. Sheep and goats are numerous, but there are no horses. In the neighbourhood of Habban the supply of water is very limited and procurable only from deep wells. The crons are therefore dependent on the rainfall.

A great fair is held annually at Hauta on the 12th Rahab, but otherwise there is little trade. Upper Yafa, The country is fertile and produces coffee, waras (bastard saffron), cotton, wheat, barley, and wax in large quantities. The Shaibi clan grow a little coffee; also red and white jowari as rain crops; and, by irrigation from wells, wheat and lucerne. Lower Yafa. In the numerous fertile valleys grapes, jowari, and mad der are grown in abundance. Coffee grows in the Wadis Mahal, Mamuma, Sha'b, Yahar, and Rahab. Horses, camels, donkeys^ skeep, and goats are said to be numerous.193 « CHAPTER V. Military. General Summary, 'Asakir' or professional soldiers are maintained by the rulers of the various districts under British protection, but except in the case of the Jemadar of Shehr and Mukalla and the Upper 'Aulaki Sultan, who maintain respectively about 1,000 men, they do not exceed two or three hundred per district. The main fighting force are the ' Qaba'il ' or tribesmen, and in the case of an un war like country like Lahej, the Sultan when going to war, hires the services of mercenaries from warlike tribes like the Yafa'i for the occasion. The ''Asakir are, as a rule, more in the nature ? of a body-guard for the chief, and an assistance to him in tax-collecting. They are often of the slave class, either of African descent, or ' 4 Muwallad 1 ' or half-caste. Armament. The principal rulers have a few cannon of antiquated pattern, which produce more of a moral than a real effect. The old matchlock, or long Arab gun, is rapidly being replaced by the breech-loader, the most common pattern being the Legras rifle or carbine. Remingtons, Turkish Martinis, and a few other patterns are occasionally seen, but in comparatively small numbers. The re-armament with the breech-loader is going on rapidly. Practically all the Subaihi now have them. The Kotaibi and Radian tribes are also well provided with them, as are the Haushabi. Generally as time goes on, the Arab will, from his better armaments, become a more formid able opponent. Ammunition for the breech-loader is of course not very plentiful, but the Arab husbands his rounds as well as he can § still any proctracted operations would be likely to exhausi his stock. During the Kotaibi expedition, a native report^ from a reliable source, stated that the tribesmen were running short, and for a few days they did not show up much. Another report, soon afterwards followed that they had received several camel-loads of ammunition from Lahej. It may have been a coincidence, but almost the next day, they made a sharp attack and fired away a good number of rounds. Each C387GSB 2c194 tribesman as a rule has his bandolier full of ammunition, some 40 rounds apiece, and unless he has sufficient warning to lay in a reserve stock, no very easy thing on short notice, his warlike career is necessarily limited. It would therefora seem well worth while, in case of future hostilities, to keep a sharp look-out on any side tracks by which the ammunition would most probably be brought up. In this connection, Arab allies might be usefully employed. Whether they could be trusted not to let the ammunition through, is another matter, but if they were allowed to keep all they took, it would probably be a greater attraction than, the opposing side could offer. Native reloading and recapping does not seem to have, as yet, attained to any considerable proportions. The sword is generally only carried by chief men, Saiyids, Sufis, and men of a more peaceful class. Spears are often carried by men without rifles, and are usually used for stabbing, the objective being the region of the liver. The '* Jambi'a,' a short broad curved dagger, is carried on all occasions by all classes. The ornamentation of the sheath and hilt depends on the status of the wearer. It is capable of inflicting a most severe wound. Fighting qualities and Most tribes may be described as fighting races. The least warlike are, perhaps, the 'Abdali, certain sections of the Haushabi, and the Amiri in the vicinity of Dhala. The best ally of the Arab is the country which he inhabits. About the plain country, it is not necessary to say more than that nand dunes, and rolling ground, with a certain amount of scrub, afford cover from which a resolute man can give a good deal of annoyance. The hillman is generally of a more warlike disposition. Accustomed from his youth up to petty feuds, in which carelessness in taking cover, or failure to keep his eyes open, may easily cost him his life, he is both active and sure-footed and can make good time on a hill-side. His fighting is gene rally in his own country or on the border, and he has a very shrewd idea of a commanding position and the best situation for a sangar. The average track in the hills is along the bed of a nullah with high and precipitous hills on either side, difficult enough195 of ascent in themselves. Artillery was found of the greatest assistance in clearing the way sufficiently for the gantry to crown the heights with little opposition, and had it not been freeTv employed, the casualties during recent operation would haw been much heavier. During the Kotaibi expedi tion, the Arabs at first showed little fear of shell fire, but time went on, they evinced an increasing aversion to it. iiiey were shrewd enough to discover that the occupation of sangara ZZan excellent target to artillery, and soon abandoned the practice. Of rifle fire they have little fear at any rate when behind cover, and though they are quite alive to the advan ta^es of smokeless powder, the solid bullet of the Lee-M is looked on with contempt, as they say that unless i in the heart or head, it does little harm. Their own firearms are carelessly looked after, the fore sight being frequently blunted and the slide of the back sight loose. At the same time they are far from contemp tible marksmen, and are capable of fair approximate shooting. \lthou&lt;di they do not understand the figures on the leat, tney have, from practice, a fair idea of how to regulate it, and not infrequently use a conspicuous tree or other object as a range- mark. As regards charges .or attacks at close quarters, we have no experience. The rifle-armed Arab carries no bayonet and has no stabbing weapon but the they occasionally follow up to short distances. A party of Kotaibi once got to 30 vards of a company of British Infantry and caused some casualties by -a' suddenly delivered fire, but of charges proper, there was no attempt. Night attacks were frequently promised, but on no occasion carried out. Inquiries from friendly Arabs as to the manner in which they would be delivered elicited the informatioa that they would take the form of heavy fire from any command ing position which they could occupy. Sniping into camps at night on a small scale was not uncommon, but j casualties were ever caused by it. As allies in carrying on operations against another tribe, the Arab has several disadvantages. In the first place it is impos sible to distinguish the friendly from the hostile Arab. Co operation being taken to mean pushing out well to the front in search of loot, if no actual fight is in progress, it is obvious 2c2196 that this not only hampers the troops, but constitutes a source of danger, as, if it is known that friendly Arabs are out in front, parties of the enemy may be allowed, as on one occasion actually occurred, to get close up with impunity. As guides they are frequently useful, and if on bad terms with the hostile tribe their fidelity can be depended on. Cer tain selected men in British employ rendered most excellent service. During the operations in the KotaibI country re tainers Oi the Amir of Dchala were on several occasions use fully employed in occupying hills near camp, which, while too far away to piquet, it was just as well to deny to the enemy. Experience went to show that the Arab is not a very early bird as a general rule. The Yafa'i were expected to attack, and, very possibly would have attacked Awabll in the small hours or at dawn but for a heavy storm at that hour; but the Kotaibi were never found to be early afoot, and on one occa sion found their sangars occupied, while they had left them to cook and eat an early meal. At the same time it is dangerous to generalise from isolated instances, and it is as well to be prepared both for night attacks and for finding the Arabs astir at early dawn. The Ahi ~ S3r ' w ' 0 l iave been for some time constantly fighting with 6 , ' , a f e sa id to charge not infrequently and it is also as well to make allowance for the difference in tactics which the lanatical spirit of a jehad might introduce. Boldness, at present, among the tribes, may be set down to ignorance as to the effect of modem weaporys, and less resist ance expected as operations advance. In fact, the action of the Ahi -Hen m holding up the escort of the Boundary Com- mission, 250 Infantry and 2 guns, when they had actually reached the head of a commanding pass, with a handful of about 40 men, can be accounted for on no other hypothesis. Although a good number of men are killed every year in small mter-tribal skirmishes and feuds, inter-tribal warfare on a larger scale is seldom of a very deadly nature. During the ^ certain Haushabi forts by the 'Abdali in 1894, the defenders, who opened a hot fire while the assailants were at a distance, ceased firing as soon as they had come within ? . lve range, and the casualties, after several thousand men .bad been engaged some days, did not exceed five. The Arabs are arrant braggarts, and describe their inter-tribal conflicts197 * • as sanguinary affairs, but enquiry shows that the casualties seldom exceed two or three aiide. In fact, the object on these occasions is to bring matters to an end without causing too heavy losses which would only impede the ultimate adjust ment of the dispute. The Arab of the hills may be not inaptly compared to the Pathan, though less formidable than, and without the dash of ? the latter. The conditions of life, their towers, which, in inter tribal warfare, are, to all practical purposes, forts, the continual existence of feuds necessitating constant watchfulness and practice in partisan warfare, all tend to produce much the same result. Operations hitherto have all been directed against isolated tribes, but should any cause such as a jehad ever lead to anything like combination on a large scale, there is little doubt that in view of the great natural difficulties of the country, both as regards offensive tactics and the supplying of a large force, operations would assume a very serious cha racter. % With regard to numbers, the estimates of the fighting strength of the various tribes, rough as they are, are the only guide that can be given, and on the political situation at any given time, would depend the numbers from whom opposition might be expected. Reference has been made in a former chapter to the unsuit- ability of the Arab temperament to regular military service. There seems, however, no reason why he might not be utilised and do good work in a more or less irregular capacity, if the bonds of discipline were made as little irksome as possible. The Arab has the following qualities as a fighting man : keen sight and wiry active physique ; he is accustomed to a very frugal diet. He has a natural aptitude for scouting, skirmishing, etc., and is, as a rule, intelligent and quick to learn. He is keen on marksmanship and with a little instruction could be a very good shot. He is fond of a fight and if led by men he trusts, would probably behave pluckily enough. On the other hand he is excitable, quarrelsome, and very inde pendent in spirit. Great tact would be required in dealing with him ; he is fairly easily led, but hard to drive. Much would depend on the careful selection of the men, more on that of the native officers, who should be of suitable social position and character, and still more on the British officer in charge,198 # f who should be not only thoroughly conversant with the language^ but also endowed with considerable patience and tactj for both would be required. Some ten Arabs were engaged by the Boundary Commis sion from the Dthala tribes, and remained with it throughout. They were employed as guides, orderlies, etc., and did most excellent work. Though nothing pleased them better than the chance of a brush with aggressive tribesmen, they were most useful as intermediaries. Aden. See under the heading ' * Forts '' in this chapter. Perim. There is a detachment of 26 men furnished by the Indian Infantry battalion at Aden and relieved every three months. The police force consists of 10 men only. Soqotra. As his only weapons the Soqotran carries a stick and a knife. Spears, and bows and arrows are quite unknown and firearms are exclusively in the hands of the Sultan's retinue. There are supposed to be about 50 Martini-Henry rifles and a few small bores of continental pattern, but old and unserviceable. Half an hour inland from Tamridah is a table-shaped hill, about 200 feet high, called Hasa, which completely com mands the whole flat district round Tamridah up to the mountains. On the top of the hill are the ruined remains of an old fort which, in a good state of repair, must have been practically impregnable. This locality is the only one in the neighbourhood adapted to the purpose. A force landing in the bay at Tamridah would be covered by fire from its ships anchored at 2,500 yards from the shore. From about half tide to full tide is the most suitable time as boats can then come close to the shore. Below half tide level the seabed slopes very gradually and troops would have to disembark in the water. A high bank gives good cover to troops forming up after disembarking, without being suffi ciently steep to hinder the subsequent advance. From the top, for about 50 yards inland, there is no cover ; but, on each flank, and to the south of Tamridah, scrub jungle, six or seven feet high, affords concealment.199 'Abdali (poor fighters) Akrabi .. • • • • ' Alawi Amiri tribes (under Amir of Dhala) .. .. 1,800 250 500 .. 10,000 'Aulaki (Upper, including 1,000 regulars) .. 9,000 The above tribes are mostly very independent and generally at feud with one auohther. The 'Abdali are the most civilized, but the least warlike, of all the tribes in south-western Arabia. The Sultan of Lahej entertains a number of Swahili slaves, who form his body guard. The population is estimated at about 15,000 but this gives no clue to the fighting strength of the tribe as they prefer hiring mercenaries to fighting themselves. In 1909 there were 30 Shaikhs of some importance in the tribe, with a total following of about 1,800 men. These Shaikhs were liable to be called on for military service.

'Alaivi, The fighting strength of the tribe has been estimated at 500, but this appears to be excessive. They employ mercenaries from the Dhanbaris and other Radfan tribes to assist them in their wars. Amir of Dhdla, There is no military organisation* in the Amir of Dhala's territories. The Amir maintains about 40 'Asdkir' or armed retainers, some of whom remain at Dhala in attendance on the Amir and others garrison Jabal Harir, Kharafa and other outlying parts, or collect dues at frontier posts. They act as escort to visitprs, and form the nucleus of the force of tribesmen in ease of inter tribal warfare. The Qabail, or tribesmen, form the real fighting force of the country. It is estimated that under the most favourable cir cumstances the Amir could collect 6,000 to 7,000* men at one time nearly all armed with rifles or matchlocks. Their only skill in fighting consists in quickness of movement among the rocky hills and cleverness in taking advantage of cover or occupying commanding positions. They often managed to keep up a hot fire upon our troops without a single man expos ing himself to view. They accompany their movements with a shrill cry. Most of the tribesmen are now armed with rifles. The greater number seen before we evacuated the hinterland were short French Gras rifles (model 1866-70) sighted up to 1,000 metres, imported from Jibuti. Most were marked ' Manufacture d 'Armes St. Etienne.' There are also among the Amir's followers about a hundred Martini-Henry and Martini-Peabody rifles, the latter obtained from time to time from Turkish deserters, a few Remingtons, and a few con verted Sniders. Many of the Arabs keep in practice by shooting game, and firing at marks and can make good use of their rifles. Ignorance of the use of sights generally prevents their fire from being ^For numbers furnished by each tribe vide Chapter III, 'Population.^201 accurate at any but point-blank ranges. During the fighting in the Ai'Ajud country in* November 1903 it was observed that the tribesmen had evidently ranged upon certain well-marked points beforehand and made good shooting in consequence.

Sniders c Tabak and all Magazine rifles ' Mesara corruption of Mauser. Those, who have not rifles, carry long matchlock muskets generally ornamented with silver studs and bands, and the butts sometimes inlaid with ivory. The other arms of the Arabs are simple light spears, and the curved dagger known as i jambi'a They sometimes use these in ambushing an enemy, but they rarely join hand to hand in open fight. Only Shaikhs of distinction carry swords. The Arab 4 ddrs ', or stone houses, are generally built and situated with a view to defence. They are solidly construct ed square buildings from two to four storeys in height with a parapet round the roof. The windows are small, like loopholes. Rough stone 4 sangars ' are built to defend approaches, * Aulahl. The 'Aulaki is a warlike, but not predatory tribe. According to Mr. Bury the Upper'Aulaki can muster some 9,000 fighting men, of whom about 1,000 are 44 ^ Asdlciri ' or professional soldiers, maintained by the Sultan. The two main divisions of the Upper 'Aulaki, called the Ahl Ma'n and the Ahl Mahajar, are said to be able to furnish some 4,000 fighting men each. No estimate can be formed of the fighting strength of the Lower 'Aulaki, Of its sub-tribes the Yarli are the most numerous, form the army, and are the chief strength of the tribe. Baidd.

They are quick to take offence, and are vindictive and treacher - ous enemies, but their friendship once secured, they are said to be trustworthy. The fighting men number about 6,800. For detailed statement of the numbers furnished by each sub-tribe, see Chapter III, c Population. ' Government is presenting the Sultan with one 15-pr. gun and one hundred rounds of ammunition. Haushabi. The Haushabi are generally peaceably disposed, and though, of late years, they have done a good deal of fighting, they cannot be classed under the heading of the warlike tribes of the Yemen. The 'Umur are the most independent spirits among them. This is a division of the tribe consisting of some 6 clans with 200 to 300 fighting men. The personal retainers of the Sultan are represented by about 100 ' A sdkir. The Dhanbarl, nominally under the Hasuhabi Sul lan though actually independent, number several hundreds of fighting men. The total number of fighting men of the Hasuhabi amounts to about 1,750. For detailed list showing the numbers available in each sub-tribe, see statement given in Chapter III, ' Popula tion/ Ka aitl. In 1887, the Ka'aiti Jemadar kept up an armed force of abcut 1,800 men in time of peace, to which he could add largely in case of war. Ha possessed a steamer, a ship and six or seven dhows for offensive purposes. KatJilrl. The tribe is supposed to number 7,000 fighting men. They are said to be a warlike and courageous people, and extremely loyal to their chief.203 Mahrl. The men carry a sword, which is never sheathed, and are armed with a stick, sharp-pointed at each end, which they use very dexterously. They also use stones as weapons of offence. Suhaihl. They usually select the hour of dawn for attack. They possess great powers of endurance and have a high reputation for courage, but are reputed to be treacherous. They own no horses and few camels, but the latter are af good breeding and very swift. They are a wild and independent tribe numbering in all perhaps 3,000 fighting men. There is, however, very little cohesion aonmg the sub-tribes and combination between, them on a large scale is, therefore, very unlikely. For details of the strength of the different tribes, see Chap ter III, 4 Population. 1 W ahldl. The Wahidis are probably one of the least aggressive tribes in the country. Possessing in the neighbourhood of the WSdi Maifa a most fertile and productive soil they have settled down into peace['ul agriculturists, fighting only when obliged to repel intruders. They hold their land on a feudal tenure, engaging to serve in time of war if called on. The Wahid! 8ullans of Balahaf and Bir 'All can muster 600 and 2,500 followers, respectively^ but many of these are Hajirls. In the centre of the country are the ruins of Nukb-ul-Hajar, situated on a commanding eminence on the right bank of the Wadi Maifa. It must once have been an impregnable fortress, and is generally identified with the Meepha Metropolis of Ptolemy. It does not belong to the Wahidi, but to a Bedouin tribe, who are perfectly independent: a wild and lawless people held in very bad repute. Yafa'l. For lighting strength of the different sub-tribes of the Yafa'i, see Chapter III, ' Population.' 2d24 204 Forts. Aden. On the south-west corner of the peninsula are the forts Tars- hyne and Morbut, which cover the entrance to the harbour and are garrisoned by two companies of Royal Garrison Artillery. The land side is protected by a strongly fortified position across the whole breadth of the isthmus. At the crater are various entrenched positions for infantry to oppose landings ; while the ridge, running North and South from Hedjuff to Viaduct Gate, forms a second line of defence and includes a redoubt at Ahman Khal, near the southern extremity. The garrison consists of the Aden Troop, one hundred strong, mounted half on horses and half on camels ; three companies of Garrison Artillery, two of which man the forts, while the third is employed with the moveable armament; six companies of British In antry; one battalion Indian Infantry, less small detachments at Perim and Shaikh Oth- man; one Portress Company and the Aden Section of Sappers and Miners. Arab Forts. Of fortresses, properly speaking, in the interior, there are none, but nearly all Arab villages in the mountains consist of solidly-built stone towers, almost invariably placed in com manding positions, and necessitating destruction by artillery or demolition by gun-cotton.* The towers are invariably loop-holed for musketry, and if stubbornly held, an attack without artillery would prove costly. They are generally square in shape and sometimes so built as to provide flanking fire on the door. They are usually 2 or 3 storeys in height with a flat roof surrounded by a low parapet. A few well-placed shells from a 10-pr. mountain gun were sufficient to demolish those fired at. At 500 yards the shell frequently passed through without doing much damage and the effect seemed better at 1,000 yards range. The villages are not surrounded by walls, but the erection of sangars would quickly convert them into positions impossible to assault by infantry unsup ported by artillery. Villages in the plain are occasionally *30 lbs. gun-cotton was the usual charge for an average tower. In ill-bullt towers where good tamping was i&gt;ossible 20 to 25 lbs. sufficed, and in the case of two or three extra large towers §0 to 60lbs. was used. Page 291.205 strengthened by a mud wall. The coast towns of Mukalla and Shehr are fortified chiefly against attacks from Beduins from the land side, and are extremely vulnerable against artillery fire from the sea. Muhalla. —There are three forts on the sea-level, semi-circular in shape, and built of stone. Several guns S. B., principally 12-pr. are mounted in each. They are very antiquated. In 1902, the limits of the town had just been extended, the west gate being beyond the New Palace, and a new gate-way having been erected. A wall, some 20 feet hi^ii and 10 feet thick, was in course of erection, from the barracks to the hill below the watch-tower and the hill had been scarped at its point of junction. On the cliffs above Mukalla are six watch towers for protection against Bedouins, solidly built of stone. The three forts have respectively 6, 4, and 3 emplacements, visible from the sea, and two of them seem to be fully occupied by guns. The third could not be seen distinctly owing to distance. Two forts command the landing at Mukalla, and even with old guns their fire at so short a range would be very deadly against boats. The buildings in the town are from 3 to 4 storeys high, and would lend themselves to street fighting. The water supply is brought in on camels and donkeys from Al- Bakarain, some four miles distant. Shehr. —Is surrounded on the land side by a wall, about. 20 feet high, with towers at frequent intervals ; average distance between them about 150 yards. They are about 30 feet high and 40 feet in breadth. There are 5 gates ; 2 large ones, one in the west wall and one in the north wall, and three small ones, at north-west and north-east corners of the wall, and in the east wall. All these gates are surmounted by fortified gateways. The sea-shore is quite open with no attempt at fortification' The wall seems to be of sun-dried bricks, but at each end, where it joins the sea, a very solid circular tower of stone is built into the sea, far enough to prevent it being passed even at low tide. These are joined by a heavy stone wall to the rest ot the wall. They have some gun emplacements, and probably mount some 12-pounder S. B. guns, of which there are some in the town. In the centre of the town stands a square fort. It has two doors on the sea-ward side, the walls are loop-holed and the top of the wall crenelated. It is about 100 yards square and 30 feet high, very solid in appearance, and built206 of stone, either sand-stone or granite. The houses are some 3 or 4 storeys in height, more scattered than the buildings in Mukalla, but effectively situated for the defence of the town against a landing party. The city of Shibam in the interior of the Hadhramaut, is also described as being surrounded by a mud-brick, wall with watch-towers, at intervals, but no details are available.20Y INFOEMATION CONCERNING THE TOWN AND TUR KISH FRONTIER POST AT KA'TABA. The town of Ka'taba lies two miles north-east of Sanah and The town. consists of a few stone and many mud houses closely built together. Houses on the outer perimeter have evidently at one time been joined by a high mud wall which surrounded the town. This wall now stands only on the south side and has been broken down and disconnected on the north and east. There is one large white mosque in the town which is visible from Sanah. The principal building is a large, flat roofed, three storied, stone built house, situated on the east side of the town and is used as a court house by the Turkish authorities. The water- supply is obtained from wells close by on the west and south sides of the town, which is situated on a rise in the plain at the foot of the western slopes of Jabal Marais. The population consists of Arabs, Jews and Turkish half- castes numbering in aU about 1,500, but it is impossible to ascer- tarn the numbers accurately, as the natives have no idea of numbers. # The fort lies on the same level as the town, | a mile du6 Turkish fort. north-west of it. Both are connected by a bad rough road, (a) Surroundings— I. (a) The position is commanded within 1,000 yards by liilla A and B, and entirely at longer ranges by the west slopes of Jabal Marais on the north and east. The fort is built on a small stony plateau which ends in an undulating, and, in places, very broken plain on the west and south. (c) The position could be ap proached from the Sanah side almost unseen from the fort by a force mak ing use of the dead ground up to within 300 or 400 yards. Jabai Marais — \5tony undulating ground Valley ^ / Sanahy^208 {d) The road from Sanah to Ka'taba is a mere camel track. (e) The valley is cultivated, but the remaining ground is mostly scrub and rocks. II. At B is the small village of Humar Ka'taba where, since the Yemen insurrection, there has been a permanent garrison of 50 men, as this position commands the road from Nadra. III. 800 yards north-west of the town on a small hill com manding it (at C) is a small post surrounded by stone with the Turkish flag flying. The garrison consists of one non commissioned officer and six artillery men, who are in charge of one mountain gun, which is trained on the town. Formerly there were two guns here, but one was removed by Amir Liwa (Brigadier-General) Ghalib Pasha when he marched from Ea'taba towards Sanah on the 14th of September 1905. The fort is a rectangular building 40 yards by 15 yards. Description of fort. with a stone building, 40 yards long by 20 high, running at right angles to it on the west side. The fort is built in two storeys, the lower, of good stone walls, 10'high, the upper, apparently an after thought, of mud. The walls are about 3' thick. I looked through a loophole from the outside, but the interior angle was so obtuse I could not see the inner edges. The lower wall of the fort and barrack are loopholed on the outside. Loopholes 1/ high by S' 7 wide outside are placed in groups of 3, with intervals of 2 7 between loopholes. The upper storey has square windows about by IS 77 with small rough loopholes cut in the mud wall near the top above them (see fig. II). The roof^of the fort is much broken and in bad repair, very little being left of it. Access to the upper storey is gaixied by the steps leading on to the tooi of the barrack (vide III). v 6 The building marked Barrack is well built throughout of stone with a flat roof, having a wall 3' high on its outer side. A sentry^ is posted on this roof by day {vide fig. IV). This building is divided up into rooms in which some of the men are quartered.The out -houses form two sides of a rectangle with the north wall of the fort. They are built Out -buildmgs. entirely of mud and are apparently used as stores. They are not placed in a state of defence and are all in an extremely dilapidated condition, as also is the upper storey erf the fort. Twenty tents are pitched on the south and west sides of the fort. These arc very old and rottea single fly bell tents. Many of them are raised, having mud walls about 3' high round the bottoms. Out side each tent is a brushwood shelter in which the men live during the day. Armament. There are no guns in the fort. {i) There are no form of obstacles Detensibiiity. whatever outside the fort. [ii) The field of fire from the loopholes is very bad; scarcely more than 200 to 300 yards in any direction. (in) Lines perfectly straight with no provisions for flank ing fire. {iv) The upper storey is probably bullet proof, but one shell would blow it light off. I was informed by the Turkish officers that the garrison was 450 strong. On the other hand I count d 20 tents, and was told that 10 men occupied ono tent. Therefore allowing for officers and guard tents they cannot possibly have more than 200 men. There is certainly not accommodation for the extra 250 in the fort and out-buildings. As far as my obser vations went I should estimate the garrison at most at 250 men. N.S. —On my last virit to Ka'taba I ascertained that the al ove estimate is correct as regards the fort. They thes* had 3C0 men garrisoned in the town and a standing outpost of 50 at Humar Ka'taba aforementioned,—making a total of 600. This increase, however, was solely on account of the war.

I gathered that there was one company Signalling, communications, of signallers in Yemen and that they teiegrspls. ^ haye no regimental signallers. The fort however is connected with the town by a telegraph which communicates with Ta'izz and Sanah; the latter line is at present out by the Arab insurgents. There are 30 mules kept in the fort; some of these are used ransport. for C8Crr y irl g water - They are all in very poor condition. Note. —I obtained the above information from observation during three visits to Ka'taba in May, July and September, res pectively. I was unable to gain an entrance to the fort itself. During the latter visit I had an opportunity of seeing the column under Amir Liwa Ghalib Pasha, which was then billeted in and211 camped near Ka'taba town. It &lt; onsisted of 2 battalions of Radifs (reservists) and I battalion of Albanian soldiers with 7 guns, making a total strength of 3 000 men. Alterations may have been made since writing this report, as I gathered from the Turkish officers that Marshal Ahmad Faizi Pasha intended, at the conclusion of the war, making a redistribution of the garrisons in Yemen, uno idea being to leave only a smallpost at Ka'taba itself and to establish a new post in the mountains above. „ , .

Perim harbour is divided into two branches by Murray Point. The main branch extends one mile to the north-west ward, the other about 7 cables in a north-easterly direction, and is much encumbered with shoals. The entrance between Perim point on the north-west and Lee point on the south-east has 8 to 0e fathoms in the fairway for a, berth of 2 cables, extending to within a cable of either side. The north-westem area has the more available space, and forms the port. Anchorage may be obtained in 5 or 6 fathoms with plenty of room for a ship to swing at about 2 cables from the coral stores. Considerable repairs to ships and machinery can be effect ed ; there is an extensive salvage plant, and European divers can be obtained. There are two small slipways, with winches for lighters and launches, which can h^ul up 100 tons dead weight. Several small steam cranes, steam hammers, etc., are available. Ras-ul-Ara is a projection 11 miles in width east and west, the centre of which is the southern extreme O 'f Arabia. There is good aiichorage in the small bay westward of Ras-ul-Ara affording shelter against the strong winds of the north-east monsoon. The beach round the bay is somewhat steep. Troops and stares were embarked and disembarked frequently during the months of April and May. In the case of the latter, some difficulty was experienced in rough weather as there is no jetty or convenience for landing. There is a well at Ras-ul-Ara providing a fairly abundant supply of brackish water, and a ruined tower built by the Sultan of Lahej. It is a -starting point for the Subaihi interior, and by its use a long desert march is avoided (v. routes). Landing was effected without difficulty at ? Uzzaf, in the Ghubbat-ul-Haiki, the bay to the west of the headland. Landing.—Bo&amp;is get within a foot or two of the water's edge; the shore is hard sand, sloping steeply, hence landing i&amp; very easy; no surf; even with a strong wind blowing from217 east-south-east varying to south-east. Men can almost jump from the boats to dry sand ; stores need be carried a few feet only. Animals could be towed in country huggalows to within a few yards of shore and then tipped out and made to scramble ashore. Country. —-A steeply-sloping bank of hard sand forms the immediate shore with a strip of some 20 yards of soft sand at the tops, then a fringe of low sand dunes, then a long stretch of fine, hard, almost level alluvial pJain covered with small stones : bushes are scattered plentifully ior some 2 miles inland, mixed with a few ' do7n ' palms and babul trees. Beyond the 2 miles line the bushes cease, but babul trees are numerous all over the plain. A landing was made at the mouth of a small dry Sailat. 200 yards up this on the left bank stands a deserted and half ruined stone Ddr built by the Sultan of Lahej. Water. —On the left bank of the Sailat 1,050 yards up from the Ddr, bearing 18° is a well of water 40' to surface of water, 2 / of water, 4 / in diameter. The water is very slightly brack ish, but quite drinkable. About 2 miles east-north-east is another well of similar dimensions called Bir-ul-Meheja, a number of Bedouins were living here in tents. No permanent dwellings were seen but there is some cultivation dependent on rainfall. It is probable that water could be found by digging in the Sailat near the existing well. Camping ground anywhere near the Ddr on the left bank of the Sailat between the Ddr and the well. TURAN.—Lies some 16 miles north-north-east of the Ddr. BANDAR 'IMRAN. Bandar 'Imran, east, of Khor 'Umaira, between the head land of J. Marsa and Has Imran, forms a bay with a depth of 12 and 13 fathoms at two miles off shore. It affords at its eastern end, under Ras 'Imran, excellent shelter from easterly winds. Water near the shore, fresh at Hiswa Kau, and brackish at Bir Mukhnuk. BANDAR FUQUM. A bay about 5 miles wide, between Ras' Imran and Ras Fuqum. It has regular depths decreasing from 6 or 7 fathoms in the entrance, towards the shore, over a bottom of sand and218 mud. The land surrounding the bay is a low, swampy tract. KHOR BIR AHMAD, OR SAILAM. Just west of Aden harbour, extends 3 miles westward of its narrow entrance. There is a depth of 6 to 8 fathoms in the approach and in the Khor which opens out to a mile or more in width. The shore consists of sand covered with small scrub. ADEN HARBOUR. Lies to the west of the Aden peninsula and is about 8 miles wide from east to west and recedes 4 miles northward. It is divided for administrative purposes into the Outer and Inner harbours. Vessels drawing 29 feet of water can enter the inner harbour at all seasons of the year. There are no piers or wharves for vessels. For boats there are the following piers on the east side of the harbour : Pilots pier, Military pier. Post Office pier. Prince oi Wales' pier. At the head of the harbour is Obstruction pier along which steam launches can lie at all times. There is also a pier at Shaikh Othman which cannot be approached at low tide. 100,000 tons of cpal is usually kept stored and coaling is effected by means of lighters always kept loaded in readiness. There is no factory capable of doing heavy work, but re pairs to hulls and machinery can be done by the firm of Luke Thomas and Company and castings up to f two tons can be done. There is a floating dock which will take a vessel of 750 tons if not over 185 feet long and a patent slip 75 feet in length for launches and small craft. Throughout the winter the prevailing wind is from the north-east, and, from beginning of June until the end of August or a little later from the south-east. During both these periods it is rarely possible to predict, even 24 hours ahead, when a land ing would be possible without undue risk In the months of May and June and also during September and the first half of October, although storms are not infrequent, landing on the east coast could generally be effected ; but the climate in these seasons is quite unsuitable for manoeuvres SHUQRA. The chief port of the Eadhli tribe. A small harbour for boats, with from one to 2| fathon s, is formed by a break in the reef which fronts the shore, at a219 distance of | mile. Good anchorage outside tlie reef witk from 7 to 9 fathoms, 4 or 5 cables outside. On landing at Shuqra, in February 1896, there was a con siderable surf on the beach, but no difficulty was experienced, transhipment from the ships into native boats being carried out outside the surf-line. The sea was moderately calm at the time. Good water can be obtianed at the village of Shuqra about a quarter of a mile inland. MAQATlN-US-SAGHlR. East of Shuqra is a small anchorage for boats, formed by a projecting point 5 miles westward of Maqatin. The water is shallow and the bottom rocky. Maqatin is an anchorage formed by a slightly projecting rocky point, from which four rocky islets and a, sunken rock project 2J cables to the southward. It is resorted to by native trading vessels for shelter during the north-east monsoon ; the anchorage is on the western side of the islets, where the water Is perfectly smooth, when it is blowing hard from the north-east. (A rocky patch of three feet lies three cables south by west of the islets, with a 4 fathoms patch at 3 cables south-south-east of it. Another patch of 1J fathoms, lies nearly i mile east of the outer islet). 5 IRKA. 'Irka is a small port of the DhuyaibT tribe, which is in the possession of a Shaikh of the Baddas Jamily, whose ancestors settled at Haura many years ago, whence they moved to 'Irka. It was opened as a port for trade some 40 years back against the wishes of the Wahidi Sultans who were^ however, power less to prevent it as the Shaikh possessed considerable influence. CrHUBBAT-UL-^AIK Troops have been landed on several occasions at Balahaf on minor military operations. Between Ras-ul-Ghusain and Ras-ul-Asaida, a bay named Ghubbat-ul-'Ain, is formed, re- -ceding 6 miles from a line connecting the two points. On its shores are the villages of'Ain ba Ma'bad, and'Ain-ul-Jawairi, the former consisting of a mosque and about 100 huts, the latter of 70 huts. Springs of water, date-trees, and jowari abound. Further eastward is the small fishing village of JU'a220 • ~ .. V and the anchorage of Balahaf, which affords good shelter dur ing easterly winds. The depth in this bay on the western side is about 20 fa thoms at 4 miles off shore, decreasing gradually towards the shore. The eastern side is deeper, and here are depths of 100 fathoms within 3 miles of the shore. B A lah A P . &gt; A port of the Wahidi country westward of Ras-uI-Asaida» In 1902 the town was bombarded by H, M. S. Perseus, and the place is now described as not easily distinguishable except at a short distance. The bay affords good shelter during easterly winds, but a sharp look-out must be kept in case the wind changes to the westward. The foreshore is rocky, with some sandy patches near Bala- haf; to the west, there is a long stretch of sandy shore, and to the east a rocky promontory runs out into the sea. There is a small sandy bay just beneath the place, where the tower stood, partly protected from the surf, where landing would be possible except in the very worst of weather. To the west, the shore is low-lying, rising near Balahaf to small hills at a distance of 500 or 600 yards, behind which lie other ridges. Further west, the hills recede from the shore. A mile and a half to the west of Balahaf, is a large mass of rock, called in the Admiralty chart Black Barn, some 200 or 300 feet high and quite isolated. Im mediately to the east of the bay is a rocky promontory, rising to 50 or 60 feot, close to the shore. An enemy occupy, ing this could greatly annoy any landing party. Surf permitting, a landing could be effected to the west. Ships can lie within 900 yards of the shore in 15 fathoms of water. There is indifferent water at Jil'a. BIR ? ALI (Bandar Husn Ghurab). A port in the Wahidi country, on the northern shore of a small, circular, and safe bay, one mile long by one and a half wide, which is, however, exposed to the south winds. To the east, near the entrance of the bay, is a hill named Shaaron, but generally called Al-Bostan. To the south of the bay is a nar row strip of land whence rises Jabal Husn-ul-Ghurab, a square black, solitary rock placed like a natural fortress to guard the entrance of the bay. 2f221 BANDAR Bimmr. (Lat. 14'20'north. Long. 48'57'east.) Is the Bay nearly 1| miles wide between the northern horn of Ras Burum and the bluff point of Radham. It is a secure anchorage during the south-west monsoon, but is open to easterly and north-easterly winds. Landing is at times difficult on account of the surf and rocks on the beach. The town of Burum is in the north-western angle of the bay; it is surrounded by date trees and stands at the foot of an offset of the -range of hills, about 1,000 feet high, which here extends down to the sea and forms a bold and rocky coast. This wret chedly built town, of which the population is about 500, as well as Fuwah, Al-Ghaidhar, etc., is under the Chief of the Buhaishi tribe, who has also several small tribes tributary to him, Ijilli, a white mosque on an eminence a sbcrt distance from the beach, may be plainly seen from the o ffin g, The territory of the Buhaishi tribe extends along the coast from Ras Rahmat to Fuwah in the bay of Mukalla, a distance of 25 miles, with a vast district inland. The tribe is called col lectively Buhaishi and, is under one Sultan, but is sub-divided into four lesser tribes, each having its own name and chief. The valleys inland are rich and beautiful, producing quan tities of jowari ; they are bounded by put pie veined mountains' which rise from 5,000 to 6,000 feet a^ove; whose summits in the cold season are at times snow-clad. Rain falls in November, December, July and August and sometimes heavy showers in April and May. Good water is to be obtained at Burum; also firewood, sheep, fowls, eggs, onions and pumpkins. Tobacco and dates are the chief produce, and a brisk trade is done during the South -west monsoon, when Burum becomes a port of refuge. The best anchorage during the south-west monsoon is in from 5 to 7 fathoms, good holding ground, with the town of Burum bearing north-west, but a ground swell rolls in. H. M. S. gull was at anchor here from January to March, 1881, during the North-east monsoon, in 7 fathoms close inshore, with the southern side of the town bearing west by north, and the north ern point of the bay north f east; the wind never blew sufficient ly atrong to make the anchorage at all dangerous, though at timesthe vessel rolled considerably. The current set continuously north -eastward, just outside the bay. MUKALLA Lat, 14° 31', Long. 49° 6'. Next to Aden, the principal commercial town on the south coast of Arabia it is partly built on a narrow project ing rocky point, and partly at the foot of a range of reddish lime stone cliffs rising to a height of about 300 feet to 500 feet im mediately behind the town, on which are four conspicuous tow ers for the protection of the place. The northern portion of the towns is built on ground sloping from the base of the hills to the bay, and is enclosed on the western side by a wall extending to the shore containing only one gate. The ground around Mukalla is barren, but one mile up the valley, west ward of the town, there are large date groves and gardens, with watch towers occupied by soldiers. A stream flows through this garden, which has its source at a place called Bokharain in a rocky ravine close by. The water supply of Mukalla is carried by an iron pipe from the source of this stream. Firewood, bullocks, sheep, fowls, fish, eggs, honey and certain vegetables can be obtained in abundance. During the south-west monsoon a considerable portion of the trade is diverted to Bandar Burum, which then becomes a secure anchorage. BANDAR RUWAINl. A small bay north-east of Ras Mukalla: has from 4 to 6 fathoms close in shore. Native trading vessels find shelter here during the south-west monsoon. SHEER L at . 14° 44 , ., L ong . 49° 35'. A large town of about 6,000 inhabitants : has an open road stead. The best anchorage is in 7 or 8 fathoms, from 7 cables to one mile from the shore. The foreshore is sandy and fiat, rising at a distance of about a mile from the shore, to a height of 50 feet, in a ridge of low sand-hills. During the south- west monsoon there is a good deal of surf, but landing can generally be effected in native boats. As a rule the surf is less in the morning before 10 a.m . When visited in February, although surf was present, a landing was effected without difficulty, transfer being made to native boats outside the surf belt. Water in the town, 2 bad wells only. Under a mile from the town towards J. Yaculif, at Dafuoja, some 30 wells of fair water. 2ir2223 On an eminence is a fortified castle, the residence of the Chief, The town is triangular in form, with high walls round it; the dwellings are much scattered. ( Sheep and vegetables may always be obtained, Sharma Bay. Twenty three miles east of Shehr. The best anchorage in this neighbourhood during the north-east monsoon. Four or five fathoms about half a mile from shore, SAIHUT. Lat , 15° 12'., Long . 51° m A Mahri town whose population varies according to the trade and season, but at certain seasons numbers 10,000. Steam vessels of the Persian Gulf Company call here occasionally; also small steamers from Aden. The scattered stone buildings in the neighbourhood are evidently erected with a view to de fence against small arms. The anchorage is an open roadstead ; regular depths of from 7 to 9 fathoms, sandy bottom, extend some four miles off shore. Sheep, fowls, milk and eggs are plentiful* QISHN. The bay is formed by the projecting headlands of Ras Sharwain tod Has Darja, 13 miles apart. The depths are regular there being 8 to 10 fathoms of water nearly two miles from the shore^ gradually decreasing towards the beach. 4 During the north east monsoon, there is a heavy ground swell and a high surf oil the beach, which renders landing dangerous except immediate ly westwards of Ras Darja, where there is a nook in which the small trading boats land their goods. The shore of the bay is low and sandy near the sea, having a high range of hills in the background with a barren tract of undulating sand hills intervening. The best anchorage is in Bandar Lask, the west ern part of Qishn Bay, is about 5 fathoms, J mile from the shore ; here vessels are sheltered from the south-west monsoon and lie in comparatively smooth water. In other parts of the bay a heavy swell rolls in at that season Landing was effected during-the month of February in nativ® boats without much difficulty.224 Qishn, a large straggling town, the principal port of the Mahri tribe and the residence of the Sultan, lies about J mile from the shore. For further details regarding the coast and anchorages gene rally, the reader is referred to the Red Sea Pilot. Good water from a well west of the town ; no supplies can be obtained. SOQOTRA There is not a single harbour on the island where vessels can ride in safety, protected from all winds ; and boats approach ing the island during the monsoon can only do so from the lee ward side. The following are the best anchorages during the south-west monsoon. Tamridah, the Bay of Kathub, Bandar Grarriah and Bandar Delaisha. At Tamridah the anchorage is very good except during the north-east monsoon, but ships must anchor about 2.500 yards out at sea, when the winds blows towards the shore, as the sea bed is of shingle and anchors drag. In any case landing is impossible in rough weather. The difference between high and low water level is about eight feet. The Bay of Kathub is more sheltered than Tamridah during the south west monsoon, but Bandar Delaisha is the best sheltered an chorage on the whole island at the period. The following are the best anchorages during the north-east monsoon—Kallansiya Bay, Shu' b Bay, Ghubbat Neh Bandar isal Bandar Faka ia sheltered by a reef from easterly winds.225 CHAPTER VIL Administration.

The Oad- is are entrusted with the administration of this law; the ruler his as far as the execution of his decisions is concerned. There , however, a wide difference between theory and practice and in the majority of districts the ruler's authority over most of the Lord orranviii e 3 an ^ Lord Derby's despatches, 1873-74,226 subjects, with the exception of his personal retainers and en tourage, is very dight. The Sultan of Lahej exercises a more absolute authority over his tribe than other rulers, with the exception, perhaps, of the Jemadar of Si ehr and Mukalla. The Haushabi, if a ruler of strong character, would, both from the nature of his country, and the character ot his people, wield much the same authority over the majority. In the Amiri country, which is a confe deracy of various small tribes, the Amir's authority, is only absolute over a comparatively small proportion. The Upper Yafa'i Saltan has little or no authority over his tribe as far aa administration is concerned. Of the Fadhli, several of the, sub-tribes are independent. The 'Aulaki have several rulers, while many of the outlying and nomadic tribes are practically beyond the control of their Sultans. The Subaihi are a law unto themselves. It will be seen, therefore, that the term u Ad ministration ' is somewhat difficult of application to so hetero geneous a collection of tribes. Penalties for the more serious crimes are, however, laid down; their exaction depends on the power of the ruler to exert his authority, or perhaps, in many cases, to get hold of the offender. Murder is broadly punishable by death, but the question is com plicated by the institution of ' diya ' or blood money, the rules as to which seem somewhat complicated and vary in their ap plication in the diflerent districts. Human life is very cheap in the sense of the frequency with which murder is committed. In the sense of the pecuniary compensation, it is expensive, a sum of 770 dollars (or 100 she-camels, which seems a very *—(Note.

For wounding, there is a scale of fines computed on the gravity of the injury inflicted.227 In the case of the capture of a murderer, the relatives of the deceased have the option of killing him or accepting the ' Amputation of the hand is the punishment for theft in most districts, but it does not seem to be often exacted at the pre sent day. Fines are inflicted for the same offence. , . Imprisonment for debt is common throughout, the debtor being generally held till the creditor is satisfied that he is unable to pay. He may be called on to pay at any subsequent time. Other offences are punishable by imprisonment or fine the greater part of the proceeds, of the latter remains with the Sul tan or Amir. is limited by his personal character to some extent, to an even , by his Pecuniary resources. Thus, though the Abclali are the least warlike of all the tribes, the Sultan of Lah- ej is universally looked upon as the most influential chief in the country, on account of his comparatively large income.

In the case of the ' Ra'aya u or ' sub ject u class, who cultivate lands owned by the ruler, from J to J the produce is paid in. Beyond the payment of taxes on pro duce, ^ales, etc., the revenue in most districts is derived from dues on passing caravans. The scale of charges varies with the nature of the commodity carried. A caravan carrying coffee from Ta'izz to Aden, stated that 2 dollars per camel-load, would be exacted for the passage through ? Abdali territory. The total cost per load (from 300 to 400 lbs,) worked out for the jour ney at 19 dollars, including camel hire, payments to Turkish customs, caravan Mukaddam, and transit dues, Coinage. —The coin universally current in British Yemen is the Maria Theresa dollar. The Indian 4-anna bit, locally called a ' baula n , has come to be the standard unit of division, five baula n going to the dollar. (Hunter in connection with Mukalla calls the same coin a ' kabir n .) The fluctuation of the dollar affects the interior very little. It is taken as being worth Re. 1-4-0, and as far as the average Arab of the interior is concerned, any alteration of that standard is looked on as an undue interference with a fixed institution. In the Sub- aihi country, rupees are current, but the dollar is generally pre ferred. The commoner weights and measures (chiefly grain) are The Rati, equal to about 1 lb. The Kasa equal to 5 rails generally: (in Dhala the Kasa is about 6f lbs and varies slightly in different districts in the neighbourhood). The KadTia equal to 16 Kasa* The Farasla equal to 28 pounds. Of these the Kasa and Kadha are used in measuring grain. The Rati and the Farasla for weight in bulk as a load of dates, etc. Superficial land measure in Lahej, according to Hunter, is the ' Dhimdf 1 equivalent to 1,700 or 1,800 square yards, or about J of an acre. The Dim apparently of about the same extent was used in Dhala. C387GSB 2a229 For eafcufating length of marches^ etc., from native infof- mation, nothing but practice and even acquaintance with the idiosyaeracies of a particular informant, are of much avail. Distances are of course measured by time, and the Arab's notions of time, according to our ideas, arte exceedingly vague. ' Sa'a or hour is a very elastic and misleading term. Distances natur ally vary much with the going, but a caravan day ' may be taken from 10 miles to a maximum of 15 miles. (If it Were a question of reaching water, the distance might be longer). A ' footday would vary from some 15 to 20 miles. A short march is often described as ' mnghadda ' literally from sunrise- to the hour of the first meal,, gefterally, taken about 9 or 10 a.m., tod would mean a march of some three or four hours' duration.

Aden is subject, politically, to the Government of Bombay, and the General Officer Commanding the brigade is also Poli tical Resident. Ho has under him five Assistants, two of whom reside at Steamer Point, one at the Crater, one at Shaikh Otb- miin, and one at Perim.230 i| r , The laws in force in the settlement are, generally speaking, illi those in force in the Bombay Presidency, supplemented oh cer- ^ points by special regulations drawn up to suit local condi- S» tions. iV ! The affairs of the Ports are regulated by the Port Trust, fe while the Settlement Committee corresponds to a municipal fit committee in India. !.? PEEIM. ^ The island is part of the'Aden Settlement and is adminis- * tered from Aden. An assistant Political officer resides in the island. SOQOTEA. Soqotra belongs to the Sultan of Qishn, and is ruled by his representative, who, also, is called SultSfi. There are no schools or prisons on the island and there appears to bo little, if any, crime. Revenue,—~ln 1847 the revenue of Soqotra was estimated by Lieutenant Cruttonden at 320 dollars collected in kind, but in 1877 Captain Hunter, Assistant Besident, estimated that it had increased to double that amount. Some revenue is derived by the Sultan from customs' duties at Qishn and Saihnt, but the amount cannot be Estimated. - •ABDAlX The administration of civil and criminal justice is in the •® hands of the Qadhi of Lahej. The Sultan occasionally adjudi- cates in serious cases. Murder, man-slaughter, etc., may be ^ punished by death at the hands of the nearest relative of the deceased, but blood moMy, 44 diya,' is usually accepted instead. In the case of wilful murder the price is about one hundred female camels.. Revenue.- —The revenues of the Lahej state are derived from sevorai sources ; land tax, transit dues, river tax and from a largo number of monopolies, besides a stipend from the British Governmont. )ffl' The tand tax aiinounts to If dollars per *dhimd ' (about J of an fii acre) per annum. In addition to this, tithes are levied on pro- l# duce. The total revenue derived from those sources m^y be 2a2 itZsr)231 estimated at 1,500 dollars per annum. In 1885 it was esti mated that the Sultan derived a yearly average of 30,000 dollars from transit dues. From the river water 3,000, dollars annually were obtained'; monopolies fetched 8, 000, dollars • his own landed property yielded 10,000 dollars; and the stipend' from Government aggregated to nearly 20,000 making an an nual total revenue of nearly 72, 000 dollars at that time. It is probably considerably mora at the present time (1914). 'Akrabi. There is one Qadhi for the 'Akrabi district, who, however only exercises jurisdiction in matrimonial matters. All cri minal and civil cases are disposed of by the 'Akrabi chief ac cording to custom. Revenue.- The chief source of revenue is the jowari and I \n d in ^ district - This y iolds in ordinary years dollars dollara - In extraordinary years it may yield 600 ^ dUe f a f, Ievied on g oods Passing out of Aden, and, owing to the gradual diversion of trade, the 'Akrabi chief has latterly derived little or no revenue from transit dues.

V f T ' he 0 . f ruling Shaikh came originally from Lower Yafa . _ At one time they were Governors of the district under the Imam of San a, but were subordinate to the Governor of the Haushabi country. When the power of the Imam declined they became independent.

JSe«e.-- T he revenue is estimated at 2,500 dollars annually derived from the crops, transit dues and an annual stipend of sixty dollars from the British Government. Each cultivator is supposed to pay to the Shaikh two (30 ' ot g rain whenever the crops are good.232 AmIr of DhIla. The Amir exercises immediate jurisdiction over his own kindred, adherents and dependents, that is to say, the inha bitants of Dhala town and the district of Jabal Harir, of the Ash ghiraf, As-Safiya, Ahl Haj Sa'id, Hazzat-ul-Abid. Lakmat-ush Shub, Zobaid, Tafwa, and Kharafa districts. He personally owns lands in many of the above, and farms them out to relatives, claiming a share of the produce for himself. This pro* duce, together with tribute in kind from some of the tribes, goes to the maintenance of the Amir's ^Asakir y or soldiery, and other dependents, to presents to Shaikhs, and to the entertainment of visitors and guests. The various tribes under the Amir of DhgLla are to a great extent autonomous, but the election of their Shaikhs is subject to the Amir's approval. Important matters and disputes between tribes are referred to the Amir's arbitration. The principal Saiyid communities are also to some extent autonomous. The relations of the different tribes with the Amir are of varying degree. The Ahl Jahaf acknowledge the Amir as their chief, and pay him a regular sum annually for certain lands leased to them. The Dakkam pay no regular tribute, but their Shaikhs visit DhSla annually, bringing presents in token of subjection. The Mafari country is the Amir's own property by gift from the Imam, as well as by sale from the Hadeyan Shaikhs. The Amir appoints the Shaikhs and they pay him revenue annually ia money and in kind. The Azraki are immediately subject to, and in close rela tions with, the Amir, they own lands in the proximity of Dhala, paying to the Amir a quarter of the produce, as well as a regular annual tribute. The Mihrabi stand in similar rela tions to the Amir. The Shairi are under the Amir's jurisdiction, and he owns lands in their country. They pay no regular tribute, but are bound to join his standard in case of war. The Ahmadi and the Humaidi both pay regular tribute, and acknowledge the Amir's authority.233 The Amir claims to exercise jurisdiction over the Halmin and 'Ajud tribes, but they pa} 7 no revenue, and are to a great extent independent, only owing a sort of general allegiance to the Amir and being supposed to join his standard in time of war. In the case of the tribes who do not pay regular tribute, the Amir exercises the right of ' Half.' This word which means literally 4 Alliance ' is used to express the compulsory enters tainment by people of one whom they acknowledge as a chief and protector. The entertainment generally consists in housing the chief and his followers and providing a goat for every ten men, and ' asid,' a thick porridge of flour, ghi, etc., for all. The chief civil and criminal administration is in the hands of the Amir himself. When at Dhala he holds court daily in his house, the Dar-ul-Haidh'. Offenders are brought before him and witnesses and others whose attendance is required are summoned by a crier from the top of his tower by name. Civil suits are brought before him for arbitration by contending parties, who are not however bound to submit to his decision. If dissatisfied, they can claim to have the mat • tei decided by Koranic law and take the case before the Qadhi ® 10 ^ )ar ) against whose decision they can further refer to the Qadhis at Jibla. In some cases the issue is at once referred to Jibla. Either party refusing to accept the decision of the Jibla court, would be punished by imprisonment. Arrests are effected by the Amir's ' Asdkir ', or armed retainers, and o. enders are imprisoned in a dungeon below the Dar-ul-Haidh. There is no code other than the Koranic law. Arwa is a term signifying a formal appeal to the Amir lor justice or protection, or the granting of a petition, empha sized by the slaying of a bullock in his presence as an offering. Tne office of Qddhl is hereditary. The Qddhls receive no legular stipend, but are assigned fees from the losing side in a case, and they receive occasional present^ from the Amir. Some tribes have their own Qddhls. Ail institution of the Imam's which seems to have outlived a ; l changes is a high court of appeal for all Yemen. It is at i . near Ibb, and is constituted by an assembly of learned Qddhls, leir decision is final in all cases. This is recognised by the Arabs everywhere, and their judgments are executed by the,234 Amir as well as by the Shaikhs of Turkish Yemen, Important eases are often referred direct to this court. The government of village communities is deputed to 'Alcils who are responsible to the Amir or to their Shaikhs for the' maintenance of order and the payment of dues. Man slaughter in pursuance of blood-feud s i s common. The feud is sometimes allowed to take its course, but the matter can be, and often is^ settled by the payment of' diya ? or blood money. The relatives of a murdered man have the right of killing the murderer. The latter when arrested is taken to the grave of his victim whose relatives may then demand his death, or the payment of 44 diya' or may condone the offence. The full ' diya ' is a slim of $770 or 100 camels. The delin quent if unable to pay appeals to his relatives, and if they fail to satisfy the claim, his property is mortgaged to the relatives of the murdered man. In a case of manslaughter the relatives may claim a sum not exceeding half diya} Adultery or assault are punished by a fine of $75 or failing payment 100 strokes. Robbery and other offences are punished by imprisonment, the culprit being sometimes tied in a constrained position and exposed to the cold ; by fines, and sometimes, though rarely, by the loss of a hand. Imprisonment is also inflicted for debt. For the continu ance of a quarrel, which has been formally settled by arbitra tion, both parties are imprisoned and only released on payment of a fine to the Amir* The assessment of crops is made by the Amir who, a little before harvest time, personally visits the districts in which he claims a proportion of the produce. In the absence of the Amir the assessment is made by his son or his principal agent. The Amir takes half the produce from Jabal Harir, the As- Safiya, Zobaid, Tafwa, and Kharafa districts. One-tenth from the Ash-Sharaf district, and the Az-Zanad lands. The weekly market at Dhala is an important source of re venue to the Amir. He employs agents to collect dues. The weights in common use are the Oqlya, about an ounce represented by the weight of 1 Rial. The Rati about 1 lb. The235 Kasa, 5 lbs. (This Varies, the Dhala Kasa is 6| lbs.) The Kela, 15 lbs. and the Farasla, 28 lbs. 16 oqlya = 1 rati. The standard of land measurement is the Dir'a, 16 Dir'a Shehla. The coinage in use is the Austrian Maria Theresa dollar or Rial, the value of which in Dhala is from 1 rupee 4 annas to 1 rupee 8 annas ; and the Indian coinage, from the rupee down- Wards. The four-anna piece is known as ' Baulacorruption of the Indian word signifying a quarter rupee. The Turks endeavoured to introduce the Ma ; idiya coinage, valuing the dollar at 2 rupees, but it did not prove acceptable to the Arabs. Revenue. —The Amir's income was in 1885 estimated at about 10,000 dollars per annum. It is derived chiefly from land, taxes on imports and exports, market fees and fines. Many of the inhabitants are absolute owners of the lands they occupy, paying a tribute to the Amir, but little attention to his mandates. Some pay one-tenth of the produce of their crops and in other cases, the Amir is part owner and shares the crop with the cultivator. The Amir also receives a monthly stipend of 200 dollars from the British Government. The Upper 2 Aulaki Shaikh and the Lower ? Aulaki Sultan were formerly Wakils or Viceroys of the Imam's, but establish ed their independence on the breakup of the power of the Imams of San'a about a century ago. All matters, criminal and civil, are disposed of by the Sul- tans or Shaikhs, acting on the advice of Shaikhs, Saiyids, or Sharifs in conformity with custom. There is one (jddhi at Nusab and one at Ahwar, but they only perform marriage cere monies. Revenue. —It is impossible to give any accurate estimate q £ the revenue, but the Upper J Aulaki Sultan's has been esti- 28 rati 5 rati 3 hasa 16 kasa 1 farasla. 1 kasa. 1 kela. 1 kada* ^A xtlaki.m ' mated at Rs. 16,000, the Upper ?

The district of Baida and its dependencies form a collec tion of small tribes in the nature of a confederacy urfder the' *Amtn Rasas Sultanate of Baida. The Baidii Sultans were formerly a very powerful factor, exercising a wide-spread and effective influence, involving the payment of tribute, and the performance of military service by the tribes subject to the central authority. Their influence has waned Considerably of late years. Some of the tribes have fallen under Turkish influence attd some^ more particularly those to the north-west^ have become independent. {See also Chapter III, &lt;tf Population.') Fadhli. The Fadhli chief has under his riominal suzerainty a large fiumber of tribes, but only a limited number are his full subjects. There are two QadhTs, one at Shuqra and one at Al-'Asala, who adjudicate on cases occurring in their respective districts. The murder of one subject by another is punished with death, or by the paymelit of blood-money {diyd) according to the choice of the injured side. The usual amount in payment is 100 she-camels^ or 750 dollars. Among the tribesmenji the accept ance of diya is not customary. Revenue.- —The Fadhli district is theoretically the property of the Sultan, wh.o exacts about half the produce from the tenants % but, as the cultivated area is small and the hill tribes not under complete control, his income from this source is small. Inclusive of the annual stipends from the British Goverri- ment, the Sultanas annual revenue may be estimated at 10,000 dollars derived from the following sources Land revetme^ revenue on ' harJca ' (a species of potash used for washing purposes and in the preparation of tobacco and snuffy import and export dues, taxes on qafilas, proceeds of land cultivated by the SuItSn on his own account and: fees onf shop-keepers. Transit dues were abolished by the agreement of 1872 C387GSB 2 m237 Haxjshabt, Criminal and civil cases are decided by the Sultan according to custom. Murder is punished by a fine but the deceased's heirs are at liberty to slay the murderer if the blood money (770 dol lars) is not paid within a certain period. There is only one Qadhi in the whole district. He resides at Ar-Raha and only performs marriage ceremonies. There are nine principal Shaikhs, each having from one to three hundred followers. Corre sponding to the sub-divisions of the tribe there are ten districts, one of these is ruled by the Sultan, the others by the chiefs con cerned. Revenue. —The annual revenue of the HaushabI Sultan is about 5,500 dollars, principally derived from land tax and tran sit dues, the latter being levied at the following rates — For every camel load of jowari .. T ^ths of a dollar. For every camel load of coffee, ghi, madder^ For every camel load of wheat and other unenumerated produce ,, |th The Sultan receives an annual stipend from the British Goy- erament of 648 dollars. At Shehr there is a civil governor assisted by a police magis trate. In the villages all petty cases are settled by the Shaikhs appointed by the Jemadar, all important matters being referred to the Jemadar. Revenue* —When the Ka'aiti Jemadar of Shehr became also ruler of Mukalla his revenues were estimated at not less than 120,000 dollars per annum. The majority of this revenue was derived from the customs at the port of Mukalla. The customs' dues are not levied at once, but an account is kept with merchants, which is adjusted every two or three months. There are also imports on land producing grass on grain, tobacco and dates. candles honey, war as, cloth and other merchandise from Aden Ka ? aiTL238 ''kasadi. All important criminal and civil matters are disposed of by the Naqib. Matrimonial and succession cases are decided by the Qadhi. Murder is punished by death ; homicide by mis adventure by imprisonment; while theft is punished by amputa- tier ot the hands and expulsion. Beienue.- —The revenue used to be derived chiefly from the ports wmch are now in possession of the Ka aiti. Mahri. The Sultan usually resides at Qishn and is represented at Soqotra by one or more of his nephews. Blood-money is accepted for murder, but the heirs may take revenge if it is not paid. There is generally a Qadhi in each village, who only per forms marriage ceremonies. Revenue. — See under Soqotra. Wahidi. The system of administration is patriarchal. The Sultans are poor and have little power. Their decisions in civil and criminal cases must be in accordance with the Mahomedan law and tribal custom, or they are disregarded. The Shaikhs are sometimes called in consultation, while, as a sort of court of appeal, a council of Sharifs or Saiyids may be assembled. The Sharifs have great influence even among the Bedouin of the hills, due in part to their descent and partly to their superior know ledge. They frequently act as peace-makers between contending tribes. Bevenue. —It is impossible to give an accurate estimate of the annual revenue, but it cannot exceed 3,000 dollars. The want of power and authority among the Sultans may bo accounted for by the absence of wealth or any large source of income on heir part the only means they have are the ' ashur a sort of property tax, and transit dues, besides the pro fits arising from any landed property of their own. Most of their income, however derived, has to be paid away to the 2B. 2239 Bedouins as a retainer for their services when required, and to restrain them from lawless acts, Upper and Lower Yafa' The connection between the two divisions of the Yafa'I ig a real one in time of war or tribal deliberation. The Sultana of Upper and Lower Yafa and the Naqib of the Mausata clan are regarded as being severally heads of the Yafa'i tribe and are supposed to unite and consult in time of national emergency. The Sultan of Lower Yafa, being of much older family than the Sultan of Upper Yafa, is regarded as the senior leader. At the same time the rule of either of these Sultans is, in many res pects, only nominal, and they have little real control over their tribesmen. Nor can they punish or imprison the latter, in the same way as, for instance, the Sultan of Lahej or Amir of Dhala. Also the power of the clans individually is great and they assert considerable independence of action. A clan or section of a clan, or groups of village, or even family, can and frequently does disassociate itself from the general policy or general action of the unit of which it forms a part. The power of the Sultan of Upper Yafa regarding tributo and revenue appears to be direcitly exercised over the people of Mahjaba (his chief town), the Da'udi clan of Al-Had and the people of Ar-Rub'atain. There are many rival claimants to Sull;3fHcbtj0, Revenues.—of Upper Yafa cannot be estimated. th^t of Lower Ya p a is estimated at 8,000 dollars, derived from posts on qdfilas and taxes, especially upon coffee.240 CHAPTER VIII. Communications. Beyond the settlement of Shaikh Othman, which may be to be part of Aden, there are no roads, properly speaking, in the Aden Protectorate. There are, however, numerous ca mel tracks, of which those on the main caravan lines are, as a rule, in good order, and offer no difficulty to pack trans port. A shore road runs from Mokha, past Shaikh Sa'Id, to Aden, sometimes actually along the shore and never more than two or three miles inland. It is only, suitable for mounted troops, convoys, etc., on account of the long distances between the wells, ol: w doh the majority are brackish, and the arduous nature of the march, caused by the climatic conditions and the stretchy of heavy sand. The most important routes from a commercial point of view are those corqimuaicating with Tur kish Yemen to the north and north-west of Aden, as the traffic of the eastern countries is nearly all by routes leading south, to adjacent ports on the sea coast Giioop I.—- Routes leadjito north and north-west to Turkish frontier. The three main routes to the Turkish frontier, taken in order from east to west, are—- (a) That leading to the Dhala valley and thence to Ka ? taba in Turkish Yemen. (5) That leading by the Tiban valley to Ta'izz and Ma via. (c) That by Mafalis and the Naqil Hamra to Ta'izz. In addition, the Turkish frontier can be reached at Karaba in the HaikI country, thence to Mokha, either direct from Aden, or more conveniently, by disembarking at Ras-ul-Axa. (a) The first 35 miles from Shaikh Othman to Nubat Da- kirn are the same for (a) and (b). The country traversed is, with the exception of the Lahej oasis, desert. Nubat Dakim may be reached either by Lahej, to which there are three tracks, the centre one pasiing Blr 'Amr being the most direct, or by a more easterly route past Bir Sa'id 'All, and thence, on the left bank of the Wadi-us-Saghir. This rout§241 was the one usually followed by the troops in 1903; two 10- mile stages and one 14-mile stage to Nubat Dakim. In the case of a brigade it would probably be necessary, on account of water, to use the Lahej route as well. These routes converge a little to the south of Zaida, but this would matter the less as there is a sufficiency of water at Nubat Dakim. Camel carts and wheeled artillery (field) were taken as far as Nubat Dakim, but with difficulty, on account of the stretches of heavy sand. On all routes, heavy going for infantry will be found, but there is nothing to delay transport. On the Lahej route, crops and irrigation may occasionally narrow the track, and cause slight delay. From Nubat Dakim onwards there are three main lines of approach to Dhala — 1. The Hardaba route. 2. The Mashwara route. 3. The Tiban valley route. No. 1 from Nubat Dakim 40 miles in three stages. This is the most direct and the most generally used. It gives a choice of three passes leading up to the Dhala valley, up to the foot of which it winds gently by the Sailat Hardaba. The passes are : the Naqil Rabad, used for the regular passage of troops and convoys 1902-4, with an ascent of about 800 feet in a mile at a fairly easy gradient. The NaqTl Thoba, an ascent of 1,000 feet in a mile, more difficult than the Naqil Rabad, but slightly more direct. The Naqil Khuraba, the pass generally used for cara vans to Turkish Yemen. The first portion of the ascent, about 600 feet in half a mile is the worst; after this, the remains of an old paved road are met, and the road has been improved by the troops. With the improvement of the lower portion, it would make the best road of the three. It leads direct to the village of Al-Jalila. Water sufficient for a Battalion with transport. 2. The Mashwara route, about the same in point of distance, is more difficult, and water is more scarce. Except as an al ternative, in case of a large body marching to economise water on the Hardaba route, it would hardly be used by troops. 3. The Tiban valley route is more circuitous, following the valleys of the Tiban and Tabaghain, and ascending to Dhala242 % by the short but somewhat difficult pass of the Darj-un-Nishfi. Distance from Nubat Dakim, 58 miles in 5 stages. During the dry season, the Tiban can be ascended to Karad, whence a fair track branches north-east to Sanah near Kataba, a distance from Nubat Dakim of about 55 miles. The Boundary Commission marched down the Tiban in December from Sanah, the stages being Karad, Hafasa and Asfal Tusan, where a halt for survey work, etc., was made. The advantage of Tu san as a stage is that a good spring obviates drinkiiic the Tiban water. The marching is in the bed of the river, and involves constant wading, but the only difficult part of the bed is in the gorge above Hafasa. A working party sent on ahead was able to clear away obstructions, and no great difficulty was expe rienced, nor did any casualties among camels occur. In the ©vent of a storm and consequent freshet, this route (above Hafasa) would be most dangerous. Fair caravan tracks lead up the Wadis Tusan and Hilhal to Mavia. From Dhala, the main caravan route runs straight down the valley to Kataba whence San'a (capital of Turkish Yemen) ia distant 8 marches, via the Naqil Hadda pass, Yarim, Damar and Wa lan. From . Nubat Dakim, a track, improved sufficiently in i ^m 0 admit of the P as sage of field guns, leads up the valley of the liban, with the mountains gradually rising higher on either side, for about 11 miles to the junction of the Wadi Akkan with the Tiban. Up to this point there is plentiful water from the liban. The caravan route to Ta'izz follows the Wadi Akkan to the junction of the Wadis Natid and Hidaba. Here it cross es the upland on the right bank of the Wadi Natid, for about % miles, till it strikes the Wadi again near Hawaimi, in which neighbourhood alone, would a plentiful supply of water be found. About 3 miles beyond Hawaimi, or roughly 16 miles from the mouth of the Akkan, the Turkish frontier is met. The Natid is followed from the border till nearly up to the Turkish customs-house of Rahda (9 miles beyond the border, in the Badu country). This portion of the route offers no itiiculty to transport, but is heavy marching for troops, ine held guns were not taken beyond Dar Akkan. In dealing with this route, the pass to the east of the Juhaili must not be forgotten, the Naqil-al-Madraja; on the south of243 it there is a barren, rough and waterless stretch of some 20 miles between it and the Tiban, but this would offer no difficulty to mounted troops, and the pass gives access to the flank of the Akkan-Ta'izz route near the junction of the Hidaba and Akkan Wadis. The caravan route to Ma via is the same as that to Ta'izz as far as the junction of the Akkan with the Tiban; thence, how ever, the Tiban is followed to the neighbourhood of Musaimir where the track crosses a rough and undulating stony plateau much intersected by nullahs and by the Warezan, in a north west direction, past the village of Ad-Dareja, and up the Wad! to the west of it. The best halting place is the vicinity of the Habil 'Arabi between the Wadis Ziyak and Raida, where water in plenty is found except in extreme drought; even then the Warezan is only a few miles away. There was an inexhaustible supply in this neighbourhood in January, and though it pro bably decreases towards April and May, a fair supply is from all accounts always available without having recourse to the Warezan. From this pointy a plateau intersected by several deep nullahs with occasional low hills, leads to the defile of the Naqil Ma via, just beyond the summit of which is the village of Ma via at a distance of about 25 miles from Musaimir Two fair tracks connect the Akkan-Ta'izz and the Ma via routes, in the Kafuf-Hawaimi line. N- B, —It is as well to mention here that the best and most plentiful water-supply is generally 'found in small streams flow ing in nullahs for a mile or so. Their course is, however, very capricious, and a stream which has been flowing abundantly for several years may suddenly disappear. It would there fore be far from wise to trust implicitly to any but the most recent report without further investigation. The same remark applies to wells. (c) The caravan route to Mafalis direct from Aden, via Bir Ahmad, Bir Fadlil, Umm Rija and the Wadi Ma'adin presents long and trying stretches of desert in the first stages. It was used by the troops supporting the Commission in the Subailn country, in the spring of 1904. The water-supply, till the stream in the Wadi Ma'adin is reached at Kuhlan, is brackish and scanty, and would not suffice for more than half a battalion with transport under present conditions, but even then great eco nomy must be exercised. Five stages to Kuhlan. Water,244 must be carried between Bir Fadhl and Umm Rija, Distance from Shaikh Othman to Kuhlan about 60 miles. Alternative route, slightly longer, but better going and water, by disembarking at Ras-ul-Ara and thence by Turan, Mu'ammaria and Umm Fajra to the Wadi Ma'adin, Transport could be marched out by coast road from Aden to Ras-ul-Ara. Abundant and good stream water at Kuhlan, whence short stage of about 5 miles to Mafalis. Easiest route for trans port, by the Wadi Ma'adin, which is, however, much commanded between Sanawi and Mafalis. In case of hostilities, best route i-, by the Nijd Rifad pass, the heights of J. Kawa and J. Nabat being held. They are, however, commanded, though not at close range, by mountains on opposite (right) bank of the Wadi Ma'adin. Lateral tracks exist connecting and (c). (1) From the Naqil Madraja by Al-Mulaihia, Dar Murshid Nasir and Dar Umm Farsha to Kuhlan. Passed by the Boun dary Commission (about 400 men and 400 animals) in Febru ary. Water was sufficient except at Dar Murshid Nasir, for which stage it must be carried. A rough road for transport and commanded almost throughout. 2. From Nubat Dakim to Dar-ul-Kudaimi Habil and Umm Rija. Sandy with waterless stretch of 20 miles between Habil and Umm Rija. 3. Tracks from Lahej and Hait-ul-Lim to Umm Rija vid Umm Sha'aibi. Sandy with waterless 15 miles stretch between the Wadi-ul-Kabir and Umm Sha'aibi. Between (r) and the sea, the track to Ras-ul-Ara from Dar- ul-Kudaimi, already mentioned; another route further to the north from Umm Fajra to Dar Salim ba Thabit, Umm Mijza and Mudariba, whence the Wadi Turan may either be followed to Turan, and Ras-ul-Ara, or another route taken crossing the Wadis Bitan and Ka'luli, via Ghail Barbar to Turan. Neither difficult for transport, but the Wadi Turan route easiest and most direct. Water sufficient for 300 men and 300 animals, was found throughout in April and May. The last-named route follows the line of the Turkish border. A track from Ghail Barbar leads by three easy stages to Karaba in the Haiki (Turkish) country, whence laden camels pass to Moza' and thence to Mokha, C387GSB 2i245 Group II.— Routes leading to the north. Our knowledge of these routes is very imperfect, Rub'atain being the most northerly point to which any British expedition has penetrated in the Yafa country, while in the Lower Yafa t Al-Kara marks the furthest limit of exploration northwards. Rub'atain was reached in four marches from Dhala. The first, across the Dhala plain to Khalla, a Muflahi village in the angle between J. Harir and the Shaibi Mountains, an easy march ; the second, to Awabll in the Shaibi country involving the ascent of three passes, 1 causing much delay and very trying to transport; the third, a descent to the Bana River by the Wadi Bakhal; ard the fourth, the ascent of a very difficult pass, the Naqil Saihan, rising nearly 3,000 feet. Some lightly-laden camels weie taken up with great difficulty, but the pass can only be saii to be fit for mule transport. Water was plentiful throughout. An easier pass exists ; the Naqil Yah a mis ; it is, however, lunger. Any extended reconnaissance was impossible on account of the threatened hostility of the Yafa'i. The main routes to the Upper Yafa country are by all accounts difficult. They necessitate the ascent of the Bana, which can be reached from Dhala by the pass, the Naqil Sait, between J. Harir and J. Halmin, and the turning off up the Wadi Hatib or the Sailat Sih. Al-Ka d, the capital of the Lower Yafa country, is about 90 miles distant from Aden. The most direct route is by 'Imad, Bir Mijhar and Al-Husn to the mouth of the Wadi Hatat, which is ascended as far as the Maskaba pass, whence the Wadi Umm Bttddara leads to Al-Kara. The road contains several bad places for transport including the Naqil Mask^ba, an as cent of aboMt 2,000 feet. Al-Kara can also be reached from Jimilin the 'Alawi country, and from the Yeramis valley, vid the Wadi Silib, but no details as to these routes are available. Group III.—Routes in the eastern portion of the protectorate. These traversed are few in number, including from Aden to Loder, to Ansab vid Shuqra, and to Ansab vid Maqatin. They were carried out by small parties, so that it is exceedingly difficul to gauge their resources as far as troops are concerned. From the reports furnished, however, it appears that water is scanty and bad, and that they are unsuited to the passage of other than small parties.246 Amir of Dhala's territory. \ There are no roads, strictly speaking, in the Amir of Dhala s s territory. All the main lines of communication are track practicable for camel transport, and there are few parts which are inaccessible for camels. There are three main lines of approach from Aden to Dhala:—• 1. the Hardaba route, 2. the Mashwara route, and 3. the Tiban Valley route. 1. Hardaba Route. —The first is the most direct and the most generally used. The distance is 83 miles in 7 stages. It winda easily up the stony Hardaba Wadi, and gives a choice of the following three passes leading up to Dhala:— (a) The Naqll Eabdd. —An ascent of 780 feet in a mile at a fairly easy gradient. (This was the pass used for the regular passage of troops and convoys between Aden and Dhala in 1902 and 1903, and the path was considerably improved.) (b) The Naqll Thoba, an ascent of about 1,000 feet in a mile, more difficult than the Naqil Rabad, but slightly more direct. (c) The Naqll Khuraiba, the pass generally used by cara vans bound for Turkish Yemen. The actual steep ascent is about 600 feet in half a mile.' There are remains of an old paved road in parts of the ascent. This pass is probably the one most capable of conver sion into a good road. It leads direct to the village of Jalila, and as an approach to Dhala itself is less direct by about a mile than the Naqil Rabad. 2. Mashwara Route. —The Mashwara route is more difficult than the Hardaba route, and water is more scarce. The dis tance is 84 miles in 8 stages. The Mashwara Pass is much more difficult than the passes on the Hardaba route. It is only used by caravans as an alternative route with a view to escaping tho exactions of the Radian tribes. 3. Tiban Valley Route.—The Tiban Valle route, though circuitous, is in some respects the most favourable of all. Th© 2x2247 distance is 98 miles in 8 or 9 stages. It ascends the Tiban Val ley to the junction of the Wadi Tabaghain, then turn^ up the Wadi Tabaghain and through the Azraki country to Dhala. The water-supply is good and plentiful throughout, and the road offers no difficulty except the short pass of the Naqil Darj-un-Nishfi close to Dhala. On the Dhala plain easy paths lead in all directions. The main caravan route to Turkish Yemen runs from the head of the Naqil Khuraiba straight down the valley till it crosses the frontier near Ka'taba, whence San'a is distant 9 mar ches via the Naqil Hadda Pass, Yerim, Damar, and Wa'lan. Paths practicable for camels, though none too easy, give access to Jabal Jahaf on the west of the Dhala Pla,in and to the Shairi country and Jabal Harir on the east, and to the Shaibi country on the north-east. A good path with a ruling gradi ent of 1 in 8 has now been made from Dhala to Jabal Jahaf by the Naqil as Sueda. &gt; There are two caravan routes which lead from Dhala territory to the Yafa country. The easier branches east from Ar Radu s a in the Hardaba valley, 8 miles from Dhala, goes to Dar-ul-Jabr atthefoot of the Halmin hills, then down the Sailat Dabab southwards for 5 or 6^ miles, then eastwards over plain country south of the Halmin hills, to Al-hajaf and Danaba, near Jabal Battar, then by a long descent into the Wadi Tem, and down the Tem valley to the Wadi Bana, and across it to the Southern Yafa country. Five stages from Dhala to AI-Kara. This route is joined in the Wadi Tem by an easy path from Jimil over a low pass, the Naqil-ur-Rabwa. The other route from Dhala to the Yafa country leads from Dhala itself down the Naqil Naima, or Naqll-ul-Karn pass in the Shairi country down to Al-Madi in the Halmin country; crosses the difficult Naqil Sait pass over the col, which unites Jabal Harir on the north with Jabal Halmin on the scaith. Then down the winding Sailat Shara to the Wadi Bana, and across it and up the passes leading to the northern and central Yafa country. Four stages from Dhala to Mahjaba. There are two caravan routes, which lead west from tha Bhala plain into Turkish Yemen. One leads through the Dak-248 kam country north of Jabal Jahaf and up the Tiban valley and branches to Ibb and Ta'izz. The other goes down the Wadi Tabaghain, across the Tiban Valley and through the Amara country to Ma via, thence to TaHzz. Soqotra. Kallansiyd to Tamridah via Eriosh and Kadhup. Between Kallansiya and Kadhup there is difficulty about water. There is a brackish well between Lim Dittar and Eriosh at a place called Dia. There is no water at Eriosh, but a brackish well at Diahamm affords the supply. From Kadhup the path becomes steep and dangerous, and is not wide enough for loaded camels, baggage, etc., being carried across the bluff by coolies. This path is passable for camels. Tamridah to Saihon {near Rds Morrl) via Dihelemnitin and Dis'hass, Water can be obtained from a stream at Dihelemnitin, otherwise the supply is very bad. The path is very rough and mountainous, in one place going over a pass 2,500 feet high. The ro®id is very bad for camels. Saihon to Tamridah via Jahaida, Roshl, the Eshall valley, Fere- ghet, Yehazahaz and Adahan, The path travels south-west through the valleys of the central districts to the Eshall valley and from there in a northerly direction to Tamridah. The path is extremely bad, though passable for camels, especially at the descent from the pass by Adahan to the plains around Tamridah. Water can be obtained at Roshi, where there is no village, and also from the numerous streams of the regions. Tamridah to Keregnigl. Keregnigi is two and-a-halt hours from Tamridah and lies in the Wadi Dial, which is the source of Tamridah's water supply. The path goes up the valley to Kischen above which is a pass. A path leading to the south of the island goes by way of the pass. Near the high pass at Kischen thera is a spring. A path leada from Keregnigl to Scheheli, which lies to the east of the high pass near Adahan. On the western side of Scheheli is a spot named249 Taleagje, where there are the remains of a sanitarium built in 1835 by the East India Company. Kcdlansiya to Tamriddh via Makan al Shiebah and Kadhup. The path leads south west from Kallansiya across some sandy plains and ascends an extremely steep bluffy to all appearances im practicable of ascent, of which the pass is 1,900 feet above the sea. From the pass the ,path travels in a south-easterly direction through grassy valleys to a hamlet where water can be obtained. Then for a distance of four miles the path leads over a stony level and then descends steeply over very rough ground into a broad rocky valley. The path then ascends some limestone hills, goes through a pass and down another steep descent, after which it turns in an easterly direction to Makan al Shiebah. It then runs north-west along a rocky river bed, and finally turning north-east comes into the plains by Goobet Koorma and thence vid Kadhup to Tamridah. Telegraph and signalling. Afield telegraph was laid from Aden to Dhala during the work of the Boundary Commission. It followed the line of the Hardaba route and the Naqil Rabad, and intermediate offices were estab lished at Bir-umm-Saifi, Nubat Dakim, and Jimil. So much trouble was caused by the constant cutting of the line, chiefly by the Kotaibi tribe, between Nubat Dakim and Dhala, that this por tion of the line was rolled up in July 1903. Signalling communica tion was established between Dhala and Nubat Dakim by an intermediate party camped on Dhubayyat, whence J. Shumshum at Aden is visible in clear weather. Much interruption was caused, especially during the winter months, by the mists. In the Subaihi country signalling communication with Aden was also maintained by a connecting station on Jabalain from the Ma'adin valley. In most parts of the country, in which troops were operating, it would nearly always be possible to establish good connecting stations, although convenience of signalling might not always coincide with proximity of water, etc., and parties, large enough to resist attacks, might have to be detailed. Sub-marine Cables. The Eastern Telegraph Company have a station on Has Baradl 1 , Steamer Point, Aden, with cables running to Suez, Perim, Zanzi bar, and Bombay.250 WlBELESS. There is a wireless installation on Elephant's Back, Steamer Point, Aden, belonging to the Colonial Office, for communicati on with Berbera. It has an ordinary range of 250 miles, but ships at 400 miles have been signalled. There are four operators, two Brit ish Eurasians and two British Indians, PSRIAl. Perim in telegraphic communication with Aden, Suez, Obokh, Mabsawa, and Suakin. 251257 APPENDIX D. Bibliography. A. The land of Uz by Abdulla Mansoor.—(E. W. Bury.)
