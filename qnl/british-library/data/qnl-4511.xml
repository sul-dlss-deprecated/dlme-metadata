If it is considered necessary to detach him from Frontier Commission at Kass [?

(January 24, 2 p.m.) YOUR telegram No. 3 of 21st January to Bushire, respecting the Khoremabad Railway survey. I yesterday communicated the substance of the recent telegraphic correspondence, with the exception of the portion relating to proposed gendarmerie operations, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency said that the Persian Government will not challenge the right to claim prolongation of option under the force majeure clause as the impossibility of proceeding is fully understood. He added that the Persian Government would take such steps as are possible to restore order, but recognised that they were helpless to do much at present. He cordially agreed that a good man must be found to fill the post of Governor-General of both Luristan and Arabistan, failing Nizam-es-Sultaneh, whom he considered the best man for the post if his health will allow him to go. He promised to make immediate enquiries about this. The Minister for Foreign Affairs asked me to supply him with a memorandum containing all the information about the actual situation that has reached me, and seemed to consider that the formal request for a prolongation of the option should be presented. He expressed the earnest hope that sufficient information may have been already collected to allow of negotiations for a final arrangement between the Persian Government and the syndicate being commenced here.

Last paragraph of Bushire telegram would appear to hint at the possibility of coming to an arrangement with Persian Government on information already collected. This would be most agreeable to Minister for Foreign Affairs, to whom I have communicated verbally fact that survey operations are temporarily suspended by force majeure.

Crosthwaite ['group undecypherable] here considered that detailed survey is impossible in existing circumstances, whether begun from south or north. As regards survey of any small selected party from north in autumn, proposed by Captain Wilson, Crosthwaite holds that its practicability will depend largely on effect of contemplated gendarmerie operations in Burujird district referred to by Minister in his telegram of 11th January, which cannot be foreseen. Before Captain Wilson’s scheme is discussed it should perhaps be considered :— 1. Whether, for the purpose of concluding arrangements between syndicate and Persian Government, information in addition to that already available is absolutely necessary ; and 2. If necessary, whether survey as proposed by Captain WilsonV^which would presumably be of a rapid nature, and which might not be of much service for constructional purposes, would suffice. These are points on which I am not in a position to offer any opinion. The tentative suggestion contained in my telegram y No. 25 [? to Government of India] of 21st January had reference to detailed survey and eventual construction of lines, not to survey as now proposed.

I gather from your observations that it is not this same difficulty which would arise on the Frontier Commission if he were temporarily withdrawn, but that what you apprehend is failure of supply and transport arrangements.

I therefore venture, with British commissioner’s cognisance, to submit the following suggestion in case my views are desired :— 1. Present survey party to leave Dizful at once and return to England. 2. Government to instruct me to leave the Commission after its arrival at Kasr-i- Shirin in order to take charge of duties of the Luristan officer. 1 should then be in a position to conduct a small and carefully selected survey party over the railway route from Khoremabad south in the autumn. This would involve extension of period of the syndicate option, but in view of the circumstances they can scarcely refuse. I believe that I could make arrangements for safe conduct of a party on the above lines, but in view of what has occurred, I do not advise party to try to go up from the south.

Copv to ? r&gt;- r, 5a 30 JAN 1914 W -0 27 JAN1914 121 - 288 ]lo [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] WITH reference to your letter of the 8th instant regarding the Mohamerah- Khoremabad Kailway Survey, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to inform you that the question has been engaging his serious attention in consultation with summarised as follows :— Alternative 1 was felt to be most undesirable on every ground. Alternative 2 would involve very, heavy and, indeed, quite unknown expenditure, for which the Persian Kailways Syndicate were justifiably not prepared to give a blank cheque. Alternative 3 offered a possible solution, as the Persian Government were proposing to mass 1,200 gendarmerie at Burujird by the 10th March, for an advance southwards on Khoremabad, and there seemed to be a fair chance that, with an escort of gendarmerie, the survey party might proceed northwards from Dizful to meet the main body without overt opposition from the tribes, restrained as they would be by the menace of this double advance. Alternative 4 was not a solution that would commend itself to His Majesty’s Government. Alternative 5, though in itself perhaps the best alternative, would take too long to be of any practical use in the present juncture. But at this interview Mr. Greenway strongly urged another course, namely, that Captain Wilson should be detached from the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, on which he is at present engaged, and sent to Dizful to secure the fulfilment of the obligations which the tribes had entered into with him. Acting on this suggestion, Sir E. Grey communicated by telegraph with Captain Wilson, who in his reply, just received, expresses the opinion that there is little prospect of the survey party getting through from Dizful this spring. This being the considered opinion of the officer most likely to ensure the success of the survey party. Sir E. Grey feels that it is useless to take him from his present work, where his services are urgently required, and that the idea must be abandoned. As regards the suggested employment of a gendarmerie escort, the latest view taken by Captain Crosthwaite is, as the Persian Railways Syndicate are probably aware, that a detaded survey is for the moment impossible, and that the situation depends on the result of the intended gendarmerie movement from Burujird. It therefore seems to Sir E. Grey that this solution can also be no longer entertained. PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. [January 26.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [ 3493 ] No. 1. Sir, Foreign Office to Persian Pailways Syndicate (Limited). Foreign Office, January 26, 1914. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and His Majesty’s consular officers in Southern Persia. In your letter it was pointed out that there appeared to be five alternative courses open to meet the situation which had arisen at Dizful, where the survey party had been brought to a standstill by the unwillingness of the Lur tribes to respect the agreements previously made by them with Captain Wilson. These alternatives were :— Persian Government. 2. To pay all subsidies, &amp;c., demanded by the tribes. 3. The despatch by the Persian Government of a strong protecting force of 1. To abandon the scheme completely and claim the expenses incurred-from the gendarmerie to Dizful. 4. The despatch by the Government of India to Dizful of a guard of Indian sowars. 5. The appointment of a strong Persian Governor to Luristan. On the 14 th instant Mr. Green way was good enough to call at this Department in order to discuss these alternatives, and the result of the interview may be shortlyIt accordingly remains to consider the situation in the light of these various factors; and I am now to put forward the line winch S.r E. Grey is of opinion offers the TheCor^o ^rrawnfromTe situation is that some sort of order must first be made to prevail in Luristan. For this, the contemplated gendannerie advance from Buruiird may pave the way, but it will have no permanent effect unless followed up by the appointment of a competent and energetic Persian Governor-General, with headquarters at Dizful, since there are no local authorities in whom any reliance whatever can be placed. Dizful would then become the base of survey operations, and ultimately of railway construction from Dizful to Khoremabad. Such an official would require an organised local force and the results could not be immediate. The raising of this local force might perhaps be directed by His Majesty’s political officer at Dizful, in view of the interests of your syndicate in the establishment of order in the neighbourhood. ^ . i i xv -i ,, Sir W. Town ley reports that the Persian Government have already ottered the appointment to the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who has accepted it, pio\ided that his health permits him to take it up. Assuming that the Nizam-es-Sultaneh or some other efficient Government can be sent forthwith to Luristan— a measure , which Sir E. Grey is prepared to urge most strongly on the Persian Government—it would seem well that the following steps should at once be taken :— 1. A demand for an extension of time for your syndicate to carry out the survey under the clause relating to force majeure in the contract of option ; 2. A request to the Persian Government, based on the same contract, that they will take measures in Luristan in consultation with His Majesty’s Government to render the survey possible; and 3. To the postponement of the despatch northwards of the survey party from Dizful until its safety and feasibility can be assured. In the meantime, it might perhaps be possible for your syndicate to settle the conditions of construction of the railway, at least in outline, on information already available—a course which, according to a report received from Sir W. Townley, would be most agreeable to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs—and some show of activity might be maintained by your syndicate south of Dizful, or on alternative routes. In view of the great importance of continuing negotiations with the Persian Government, Sir E. Grey earnestly hopes that it may be found possible to work on the information already available, and he would be glad to be favoured with your views on the question at your early convenience. I am, &amp;c. EYRE A. CROWE. P.S .—January 26.—I am to add that since this letter was written, a telegram has been received from Sir W. Townley to the following effect:— He has communicated the substance of the recent telegraphic correspondence, who, in reply to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the Persian Government would not challenge the right of the syndicate to claim a prolongation of the option under the clause regarding force majeure, as they fully understood the impossibility of proceeding with the work at present. His Excellency added that his Government would take such steps as may be possible to restore order, but recognised that they were helpless to do so at present.

We can include De Brucq, if he comes alone, as one of our party but if three green Belgians are coming with him, our supply problem will become much more difficult,and in all probability my agreements with the tribes will not be held by them to cover him and his party, and I cannot foresee what will transpire under those circums tances.

When I arrive I will telegraph to you again. (5). It is requested that the sura of £ Stg 3,000/- may be placed at the disposal of myself and my successor to meet the promised subsidies to the tribes. The money would be expended in consultation with Whitelaw when necessity might arise. The distribution should be made as follows :- £ 1000/- at the Imperial Bank of Persia Ramadan a$ once. £ 500/- ,, &gt; &gt; » &gt; ,, &gt; &gt; on March 1st. £ 1000 /- ,, &gt; * ,, Mohammerah at once. £ 500/- ,, &gt; &gt; ' ’» , 0 ? .

About £ 500 are required out of the third named sum to recoup me for payments I have already made out of my private money, including earnest money paid to the tribes, advances of subsidies, and expenses incurred on behalf of Douglas who has not enough money to cover his journey. A detailed account is being sent h toto the Anglo-PerElan Oil Company’s Agent at Mohammerah, and I should he glad if instructions could he issued to him tp pay me the amount in question. Unless there is some unforeseen delay, the pas r sage of the survey party through Luristan should he accomplithed on the above expenditure. The Resident in the Persian Gulf has been asked to communicate this to the Syndicate* s Agents at Mohammerah. It is requested that a copy may he eent to Captain Crosthwaite and that V/hitelaw may he informed- of the purport through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Mohammerah. ***-*-*•*-**Telegram P Prom Wilson via Hamadan (Khurramabad October 20th). To Resident. No. Nil. Dated 5.11.13. Received 6.11.13. With reference to my London telegram of today's date. There seems every reason to hope that the satisfactory and unmolested progress of the survey may be adequately guaranteed by the agreements with the tribes and that £ 3000/- will cover the subsidies. I received a telegram from Greenway about last May which gave me to understand that for subsidies connected with the preliminary survey only, £ 2000/- was the amount the Syndicate were prepared to expend. However, in order that unfortunate incidents may be avoided and to enable the Luristan Officer to cope with any emergency, it is essential that the latter on whom lies responsibility for the safety of the party, should have authority to spend Government money if urgent necessity should arise. For the above purpose I venture to request that the sanction of Government may be sought for a special non-recurringnon-recurring grant of £ 1000/- There are no means of communicating rapidly, so that reference to higher authority is impossible and on occasion prompt action is necessitated by local circumstances. The Persian Government might contend that such sums did not form a legitimate charge on the expenses of survey etc., and might in consequence refuse to refund them. Such abnormal expenditure cannot be met by the present office contract grant, which is only sufficient for current requirements. It is hoped that you will see your way to support ing the above proposal in consideration of the importance of the British Interests which are involved. It is clearly understood that only in case of real emergency will any payment be made from this sum.CONFIDENTIAL. No. 3483, dated Bushire, the aoth November (received the 1st December) 1913.

PrScis. .'s Forwards report on present condition of affairs in Luristan. Dated Khurramabad, the 19th October 1913. From—C aptain A. T. WILSON, C.M.G., Assistant Resident, On Special Duty in Khuzistan, To— His Excellency Sir Walter Townley, K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran. In continuation of my despatch dated September 30th, regarding the posi tion of affairs in Burujird, and in accordance with Your Excellency’s instructions 1 have the honour to submit the following report on the present condition or affairs in Luristan, with particular reference to the interests of the Persian Rail way Syndicate in the province. Luristan has been in a more or less continuous state of anarchy for many vparc varied by brief periods during which order was maintained by energetic Governors : but the relics of ancient well-guarded caravan tracks, and the reports of early travellers, indicate that previous to the introduction of fire arms there was an extensive traffic from South to North through the province. For practical purposes Luristan may be said to consist of four districts, situated relatively to each other as follows □ B»ni;ird. V- x:v % ^ % *4. V Paabt-i-Koh-3. Pusht’i'Kuh. —Pusht-i-Kuh is a district apart: it is well ruled by a strong hereditary Wali with a turbulent son : it is traversed by no trade routes and can for the present be left out of account. The VVali pays no revenue, but his tribes do not indulge in brigandage outside Pusht-i-Kuh, and the condition of the dis trict is on the whole satisfactory. 4. Pish-i-Ruh. —Pish-i-Kuh includes all the West and North-West portions of the province and is the habitat of the Silsileh and Dilfan clans, which are subdivided into a great number of minor and independent tribes. For the past ten years the district has been controlled to some extent by Nazar Ali Khan Sardar Akram, a brigand who has risen to his present position by his own force of character and ability, but remains potentially a brigand still. Like the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh he is on friendly terms with British officers, and has given every facility to me this year as in 19n, to travel in his country, besides affording other proofs of good-will. If a strong Governor General were to give some prac tical support to the Sardar Akram, the latter would probably be glad to co operate with him, and by this means some sort of order could be maintained in Pish-i Kuh. But occasionally official punitive expeditions would still be neces sary to deal with the tribes who live in Khaweh and Alishtar and raid Nihawand territory. When the Sardar Akram punishes such tribes he does so willingly enough, but with an eye to his future relations with them, and to the feelings of his own tribesmen, and is unable to mete out that ruthless punishment which alone has any permanent effect: he suppresses them for the time beincr that is all. 5. This district, which takes its name from the congeries of tribes that inhabit it, lies athwart the only practicable caravan tracks, cart-roads or railway alignments from South to North, and any Governor General who (like the ’Ain-ud-Dauleh) has attempted to open up the Luristan road has occupied himself mainly with this district, and with the Bairanwand (who are strictly speak ing part of the Bala Gariweh). y K Ihe inhabitants, Dirakwand and Judeki have no facilities for plunderine an\ one but their fellow's, and the townspeople of Khurramabad : their depredations in Arabistan are unimportant and do not affect the general question of Luristan they pay no revenue. . ^ an( ^ ^ben the Luristan road is to be opened, or a railway built this dis^ tnct must be seriously taken in hand : if not it is not worthwhile to do so. It is with this group of tribes that I have concluded agreements for the safe conduct of the Survey Party to Khurramabad. at 10 . 5a c &lt;, ' K ’ a ”/ir Tlli l t ^ be ’. with whom ’ for some purposes, are allied the All ivham bagwand, have their winter quarters in Pusht-i-Kuh, and spend the summer near Burujird. ^ fa f r &gt;i the gre fZ *? art . ° 1 f the brigandage that has devasted the settled stncts of Iraq and Malayir during the past few' years has been due to them. It was with them that Amir Mufakhan had to fight in 1911 before he could reach Khurramabad and though he had more than 3,000 men with him it was more by good luck than good management that he did not suffer a severe defeat. 1 strong Governor General at Burujird with a force of 1,000 men or even less, if under European leaders, whilst unable to enter the hills of the Pairanwand n punish them as they deserve could nevertheless keep them in check and put a stop to all raiding northwards or in the neighbourhood of Burujird. P It is only because there has been no sort of force at Burujird that the Bairanwand have been able to extend the area of their raids so far northwards.^ • ^ onl y r ^ mains t0 consider the town of Khurramabad, this is governed n the absence of any one else, jointly bv the heads nf tko t 1 ,• ^ r ... ’ known as the Diwanbegi and he BebeiCi The! °1 V lead ! ng fam,I,e l- British officers and are at present in recSf , ° n V£ry g °? d terms w,th Survev Partv n . present in receipt ot salaries in connection with the y y. 1 he town is unimportant commercially and manages to maintain4 fairly sat.sfactory relat.ons with the surrounding tribes : the absence of a Gov ernor General has no such grave effect on its prosperity as on that of Burujird. 8. The views submitted above may be briefly summarized as follows : Pusht-i-Kuh will not be affected one way or the other by a Governor General : status quo satisfactory to us. . Ptsk-t-Kuh. Governor General not likely to improve matters : from our point of view present position not unsatisfactory: from point of view of Persian Government no worse than for last ten years or so. Bata Gariweh : not worthwhile to take district in hand unless it is intend ed to embark on road or railway construction. Batranwand .—It is important to restore order : this can be done by a Gov- vernor at Burujird with a small force. 9. 1 he logical deduction from the above premises, if they are so fortunate as to meet with Your Excellency’s acceptance, would seem to be that the appointment of a Governor for Burujird with a small force (as already suggested) will suffice to dispose for the time being of the Bairanwand question. As regards the Bala Gariweh, it will be time enough for us to give active support to a Governor General when our railway option has been converted into a concession. Order once restored railway construction would be greatly facili tated, but the process would take some time, 6 months or more, and in the meantime work would be at a standstill. 10. I am hcpeful that the agreements I have made with the Bala Gariweh tribes and others will ensure the satisfactory progress of the Survey Party between now and next March or April, when it should reach Khurramabad, and until it has been shewn that the tribes will not act up to their engagements or until the Survey Party has left Luristan, I am inclined to deprecate the despatch of a Governor General to Luristan, unless it is understood that he will remain at Burujird. If however a Governor General is despatched, his first act should be to write to the various tribes and notables with whom I have conducted engage ments, expressing his approval of the latter and enjoining all concerned to act in conformity therewith under pain of incurring the wrath of the Persian Govern ment. I attach great importance to this step, and beg that Your Excellency will insist on its observance in event of a Governor General being appointed : I have given copies of all our agreements to the Beglerbegi of Khurramabad, a man who has enjoyed the confidence of successive Governors General and who is now the Khurramabad agent of the Persian Railway Syndicate at a monthly salary of 1,000 Krans (and also Deputy Governor) and have instructed him to communicate them to (?) 11. I will shortly submit to Your Excellency copies of the agreements in question, together with translations, in order that should it be deemed expedient they may be communicated to the Persian Government, though on general grounds 1 should be inclined to deprecate any such step as the Persian Govern ment is not unlikely to raise objections to them on one ground or another, to the prejudice of the Survey Party in Luristan, and to the Persian Railway Syndicate, when the time comes for the recovery of the cost of the survey from the Persian Government.

Wilson, C.M.G., Additional Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, on special duty in Khuzistan, To— Lilutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf. With reference to my telegram to His Majesty’s Foreign Office, dated October 21st, I have the honour to submit, as per attached list, copies of agree ments and undertakings which I have obtained and given in connection with the operations in Luristan of a survey party despatched by the Persian Railway Syndicate. For the sake of completeness, I have added thereto documents (Nos. 2 and 3) relating to a cart road from Dizful to Khurramabad through the Sardar Akram’s territories, which I obtained in 1911 together with an undertaking (No. 3) con firming and renewing it. 2. A few words of explanation seem called for as to the objects and effect of the enclosed documents. Enclosure No. /. is self-explanatory. C107FD■&gt; Mirza Ali Akbar has been retained to act as intermediary and negotiator between the Syndicate’s engineers (or the Lunstan Officer on their behalf) and Lurs and others. The ability, perseverance and energy wh.ch he has already shown in the course of the present negotiations ts, I think, sufficient justification Enclosures 2 and 3 have been mentioned above ; they relate_ to cart-road construction ; No. 2 was obtained by me in 4 911 less for its intrinsic value than as a first step towards practical relations with the Sardar Akram. Enclosure No. 4 envisages all arrangements for the Survey Party along tlie right bank of or west of the Kashgan River. Enclosure No. 5-* hw already related in my diary the circumstances which made it necessary to give the Sardar Akram this undertaking, and trust that it will be considered unobjectionable in form. Enclosures No. 6 and J cover the movements of the .Survey Party m Chigini territory from Pul-i-Kalhur on the Kashgan to Khurraimabad. Enclosure No. S needs no -explanation. Saifullah Khan made the offer of his house for the temporary use of the Survey Party voluntarily and it was deemed advisable to accept it. Enclosures Nos. g io 14 provide for the movements of the Survey Party between Dizful and Khurramabad generally and in particular from Qal’eh Riza 30 miles N.-N.-W. of Dizful to Chul and Jaidar, about 100 mites N.-W. of Dizful; the various signatories represent a powerful group of tribes who have in the past exercised and still claims rights over the whole caravan road from Dizful to Khurramabad. They are in a position to arrest the progress of the Survey Party at any point between Dizful and Khurramabad, and will have to be paid accordingly. Enclosures 15 an ^ *6 are designed to secure to the Persian Railway Syndicate’s officials the support and active assistance of the two principal personages of Khurramabad, who are joint Governors of the town, namely, the Diwanbegi and Beglerbegi. These two notables exercise a certain influence over the tribes generally, and are related to many of them by marriage ; in the last resort they are in a position to exert pressure on the tribes by depriving them of access to the town. The Diwanbegi with about 20 sowars will accompany the Survey Party and thus make the latter to some extent independent of local guards ; the Diwanbegi should in addition be able to assist the party materially by smoothing over differences between rival chiefs, which are a fruitful source of embarrassment to the traveller in Luristan. The Beglerbegi will remain at Khurramabad and act as the Syndicate’s agent there. He is a man of some ability, and owns a good deal of land in the neighbourhood and is in a position to be of considerable assistance to us. The Dewanbegi andPeglerbegi are rivals and it was necessary to place them on an equal footing ; they have become sureties for each other and also (enclosure 10) guarantee the good faith of the Bala Gariweh tribes. Enclosures Nos. IJ lo ig provide for the movements of the Survey Party in Judeki territory from Chul (near the junction of the Saidmarreh and Kashgan Rivers) to Puld-Kalhur, along the left bank of the Kashgan. I am not sure whether it will be possible to pay the Judeki only for the period that the party is in their territory or whether they will have to be paid all the time the Survey Party is at work between Dizful and Khurramabad. Enclosure No. 20 ) which will be supplemented by a detailed agreement, which has yet to be sealed, is designed to cover the movements of the Survey Party between Bukuh (some nine miles north of Dizful) and-Qal’eh Riza, some 30 miles N.N.-W. of Dizful. 3. Arrangements have still to be made wdth the Sagwand, who infest the west bank of the Diz near Dizful ; 1 hope to come to an agreement with them on the way down.* &gt; &lt;4* North of Khurramabad the Bairanwand and the Ali Khani Sagwand remain to be dealt with. I have entered into some preliminary negotiations with the ‘Bairanwand by letter and anticipate that they will prove amenable later on': at present the gendarmerie incident has made them difficult to deal with. \ The nature of the agreement to be made with them must depend to some extent on whether or not the Survey Party is to make a survey from Khurramabad to Burujird ; I am addressing you separately on the subject. 4. The following is a rough estimate of the approximate cost of tribal sub sidies, etc., provided for by the enclosed agreements, after making a liberal allowance for payments to tribes before or after the Survey Party reaches or leaves their territories.

I much regret that 1 have been compelled to agree on behalf of the Syndicate to pay the large subsidies detailed above, but the fact is that large as they appea? when shown as lumpsums, by the time they have been divided up amongst the scores of petty headmen who constitute in these days of unrestrained' anarchy the so e au her,ty of any sort amongst the tribes, they amount to little enough per i;“in»Si, 5 r4°.sr ■ .-A 6.

CrOSTHWAITE, Assistant Resident on special duty in Khuzistan, To— Lieutenant-Colonbl Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I,, Political Resident •in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to refer to Captain Wilson's letter to you dated the 21st October from Khurramabad, and also to his Diary from October 5th to October 31st, which were sent under flying seal to me, and which I am forwarding by this post. J 2. Until these documents reached me, 1 was under the impression that Captain Wilson’s present journey through Luristan was being taken with a view to showing Mr. Douglas, or one of the British Engineers, the most easterly of the possible alignments of the railway, and also with a view to introducing Mr. Soane to the various notables and tribal chiefs with whom the Political Officer appointed in Captain Wilson’s place, and the Survey Party would subsequently have to deal. I had mo idea that Captain Wilson was empowered to make or intended to make agreements for the Survey Party from Dizful to Khurramabad. Had I known what Captain Wilson intended to do, I should have at once pro- tested most emphatically against any action on his part, committing me, on behalf of the Syndicate, to any definite obligations. I should have based my protest on several separate reasons, each, I submit, sufficiently cogent to justify my action. * 1 J . 3 * the first place I do not consider it feasible to carry out the survey r it f*n 'll 0 ~’ etter sa ^ e g u ard than the agreements of the Lur chieftains, however or 1 e the agreements may be by oaths on the Quran or other solemn promises. Experience in the past has amply proved that such agreements are not on y not reliable, but are more likely to be broken than not. It would perhaps not be out of place here to call attention to Captain Wilson’s own words w ic quote from his Diary for October 9th 1913:—“The occurrence however ™ to emphasize the fact that in 1913, to a greater extent even than in 1911, men ave very little control over their adherents, and a few malcontents can easily render valueless agreements that have been signed, sealed, and deliver d (m return for valuable consideration) by their nominal chiefs, who are afraid to “ a ? y / ea a l Uthorit / Were the agreements backed by giving of host- ^ J members . of the tribe &gt; accompanied by their women folk to Lwerf ,1 , and located in Ahwaz or Mohammerah in the r P easoni hl h nd f S ? f Shaikh u Khazal &gt; the ' I am inclined to think that it would be hostaat, u l enter th u C0UI ? try with the Surve y Party. To arrange for such tion exrpnt 'th * l en gthy and extremely difficult piece of negotia- irnoMsm^fn nr h f ^ ° f a P owerful Governor. Captain Wilson has found it come into rv mc&gt; L e an P romise s that a number of the sons of the chiefs will them 0 ? 1 t . a ^ es ’ as tbere is no one in Dizful with power to keep such hostage*; ’ an i d aS cou ^ d S et back to their tribe in 24 hours, the tribesmen are ^ ’ 'a tkere 18 anything to be gained by breaking it, unless for the man ' certain . d egree by personal regard fnd liking made bv Caotain W '7 ° m 1^ ^ arG deakn S&gt; and I consider that the agreements smfl chance of 18 and liked b y the stand a very g ept ^hen Captain Wilson leaves the province and a*v #1 * -17 stranger takes over the conduct of negotiations. If there were any question of going into the country on the guarantee of agreements, I consider it absolutely necessary that the agreements should have been made with the Political Officer deputed to accompany the Survey Party, when the strength of the agreements would be tested. 5 ; Thirdly, any agreements Captain Wilson might make could only serve to complicate matters, if, as I have proposed (in my letter No. 1 dated 15th Octo ber last), the Nizam-es-Saltaneh is appointed Governor General. In° addition the agreements would involve the expenditure of money unnecessarily. 6. Captain Wilson has however now concluded agreements involving a minimum expenditure of some £ 3,000 and has in some cases spent large sums as earnest money. These agreements will have to be kept, though I think it will be possible in the event of my proposal being carried through, to reduce expenditure where payment is promised according to the number of guards supplied. 7. ‘I am of opinion that if the Nizam-es-Saltaneh is appointed, as proposed by me in my letter No. 1 quoted above, it will be possible to carry out the survey and commence work within three weeks of the new Governor’s arrival here. Thereafter I hope that the surveyors may be able to work in two parties, and complete the survey safely and expeditiously. If the Nizam-es-Saltaneh is not appointed, I do not consider that the survey can be carried out this winter. In paragraphs 3 and 4 above I have detailed some of my reasons, and in my letter No. 1 I have given others, but in addition to these reasons an examination of the agreements themselves shows that, as regards the journey of the survey party from Dizful to Khurramabad, they are loosely worded and would require careful revision and confirmation. I would also remark that in no single instance have I been referred to by name as one of the contracting parties. It will be observed that whereas in every case, Captain Wilson and Mirza Ali Akbar are mentioned by name, and Mr. Douglas is referred to as “ flis Excellency the Engineer”, the party travelling from Dizful to Khurramabad is referred to as “ the engineers and their establishment ” or in very similar terms. To take actual examples; in the oath of the Bahar- wand Kadkhudas, forming enclosnre No. 9 of Captain Wilson''s letter, dated from Khurramahad on the 21st October, the Survey Party is referred to as “ their excellencies the engineers and their establishments In the general oath of of the Khans, Mirs and Kadkhudas of the Baharwand and Judeki, enclosure No. 10, the journey of the Survey Party is provided for in the words ‘ or in the return of the engineers to Khurramabad from Dizful ”. Enclosures Nos. 11 and 12 are somewhat similarly worded, and in the document given by Captain \\ ilson to the Mir and Baharwand Chiefs, enclosure No. 14, the following passage occurs— “ * * * and provided that all the clauses and conditions of the agreement and the conditions of the aforesaid Quran are correctly and completely carried out and executed in such manner as to give satisfaction to the undersigned (Captain Wilson) and to the administration of the British engineers I am of opinion that in all these oaths and agreements I should have been mentioned by name as the person to whom the tribesmen would be responsible for the fulfilment ot their promises. As the documents are worded I have no locus standi and am not even covered by the promise of protection, unless I am presume to e a member of the engineers establishment. I submit that if 1 am to do useful work for the Survey Party my position should be distinctly shown and my status magnified rather than diminished, actually it would be possible to read some o the principal agreements and still remain ignorant of tne lac a Officer had been appointed to accompany the Survey Party. Captain Wilson in his Military Report on Luristan after describing the treacherous attack the Baharwand Mirs on Major Douglas and Lieutenant Lonmer, writes as follows “ The excuses given by the Chiefs for the transaction were typical. They alleged that C they § nad sealed the Quran only for the uPiourney and no for the return to Dizful; that their agreement wt h regard to ** n . r ( . 1 ..! _ ,.* &gt; 1. ^-1 ■ ru thr double iourney ”. I quote this fit As a matter of fact their oath covered the double journey^ as an instance of the necessity for the clear and defimttve draftmg of agreements.8 I greatly regret the ton/of criticism in this letter, but I feel bound to set beforf you my reasons for not accepting the responsibility of undertaking the safe conduct of the Survey Party through Lunstan on the guarantee concluded by Captain Wilson. o. I have not yet heard that the Nizam-es-Saltaneh has been appointed or not; in the event ol his appointment I propose following the line of action which first proposed in my letter dated October 15th last I he cost, however will be increased by a sum nearly equal to the amount to which we are committed by Captain Wilson in his agreements, and I beg that I may be informed as soon as possible, whether the Persian Railways Syndicate are prepared to pay the sum of A.ooo which will now be necessary. It may be possible to effect a reduc tion in this sum, but 1 could not at this stage make any definite statement to that effect. 10. Finally, I beg, in all deference, to again emphasize the fact there is a vast difference between the successful performance of a rapid journey through Luristan, by an officer thoroughly conversant with the Lurs, their language and customs, and the successful conduct of five British engineers, none of whom know Persian, and who propose slowly traversing the country^ doing field work in small detached parties, out of sight of camp and of each other. A perusal of Captain Wilson’s diaries shows that only his readiness and tact has availed to avoid “ incidents ” and that the latter are liable to arise suddenly and for no cause that can be foreseen. Dated Ahwaz, the 12th November 1913. From—C aptain A. T. Wilson, C.M.G., To—L ieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence regarding the arrange ments to be made for the safe conduct of the Survey Party through Lunstan, ending with Captain Crosthwaite’s letter dated November 4th, upon which I venture to submit the following comments. 2. The whole trend of the official correspondence regarding the arrange ments to be made for the Survey Party, both before and after it was decided that I should come down through Luristan in the autumn, indicates that it was intended that l should get into touch with the tribes before the Survey Party arrived, and make arrangements on my way down country with them for its safe conduct. It was on this basis that I discussed ways and means with officials in His Majesty’s Foreign Office, with Mr. Greenway and Messrs. Pearsons, and it was on this understanding that I submitted my plans in outline verbally to His Majesty's Minister in September. 3. When it was proposed to depute me to the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, my first request was, as you are aware, that I should be permitted to go through Luristan to make these arrangements, and this course received the formal assent of His Majesty’s India and Foreign Offices after full discussion. 4. The possibility of a competent Governor-General being appointed to Luristan was fully discussed with His Majesty’s Minister when I was at Tehran: I gathered from him that he considered the Farman Farma, then a candidate for the post, to be unsuitable, and I also understood that he was not inclined to press for the appointment of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh as Governor General of Luristan owing to his past record in this province : in the course of my discussion on this subject 1 expressed the view that, knowing what 1 did of his reputation in Luristan, and the bitter enmities he had aroused in the province, his chances of success were not sufficiently great to warrant us in giving active support to his candidature, though I was equally not prepared to recommend that his nomination be actively discouraged.The upshot of my discussion with His Majesty’s Minister was that I was told to uiake the best arrangements I could locally with the tribesmen for the safe conduct of the Survey Party. 5 * As regards the specific objections raised in Captain Crosthwaite’s under reference, I venture to offer the following comments letter Paragraphs 3 and 4 —These contain expressions of opinion with which I am not m entire accord I should myself be prepared to take the responsibility of taking the Survey Party through under existing arrangements, and I believe that the Lurs ' v 'l | keep or break the agreements irrespective of the identity of the incumbent of the Dizful: but this is inevitably a personal opinion and 1 aeree that the matter is one upon which there is room for wide and legitimate divergence of view. 7 8 Paragraph 5.—I have frequently discussed with local notables the possibi lity of a Governor General being appointed, and the probable effect of such an appointment on the agreements I have concluded. The unanimous opinion has been that no Governor General could ensure the safe conduct of the party without some such arrangements. Almost all hold that the appointment of a strong Governor General would greatly strengthen the hands of the Syndicate whose operations would^ in turn be of great assistance to the Governor General, but some incline to the view that the Syndicate could not work in Luristan until the Governor General has established himself strongly, i.e. } not for 6 or 8 months. I am not prepared to say which of these views is the more likely to prove correct, but I have a good ground for believing the agreements in substantially their present form to be essential, whether or not a Governor General is appointed. Paragraph 6 .—I concur that the agreements should be kept, and may add that I think the success of the Governor General will in large measure depend on our keeping them. Paragraph 7.—I am not prepared to express an opinion as to the view expressed in this first part of paragraph. 6. As regards the omission of Captain Crosthwaite’s name, this is not, I think, a matter of any importance. I need not enter here into my reasons for not inserting his name in the agreements: at the time they seemed to me to be adequate, but on reconsideration I am inclined to think it would have been better had I made him one of the contracting parties ; I can only express my regret for the omission, which is however easily remediable. 7. I will not offer any further remarks on the letter, but will conclude by stating, briefly, in case my views on the subject be desired, that, taken in com bination with the agreements concluded by me with the tribes, the proposal to support the Nizam-us-Saltaneh presents certain important advantages, whilst its dangers may be largely mitigated by the increased influence I believe we are now in a position to bring to bear on Nazar Ali Khan Sardar Akram, the Nizam’s bitterest enemy in Luristan. 8. I would enter here a caveat against too much reliance being placed on the views and opinions of the Shaikh of Mohammerah on Luristan affairs, with which he is not really in touch; I fear that his advocacy of the^ Nizam-us-Sul- taneh as Governor General in Luristan is, consciously or unconsciously, actuated by other considerations than his suitability for the post. Nor do I think that the Persian Railway^ Syndicate will be prepared to finance the Nizam’es-Saltaneh, who will, I am inclined to think, require ^2,000 or ^3,000 a month from some source or other if he is to have any chance of success. But these are largely matters of opinion, in regard to which I recognize that my own views may not be free from bias. I need hardly add that I entirely agree that if appointed the Nizam-es- Saltaneh should hold charge of Arabistan, Luristan, and Burujird : this arrange ment is one amply sanctioned by ancient, and up to recent times almost invariable custom and every Governor General of Luristan, including Amir Mufakham in ion, has considered the joint Governorship of the two provinces essential for success : both provinces were under Nizam*es*Saltaneh during his term of o ce in 190708.Telegram P„ dated Dizful, the 8 th Nobember 1913* From— Captain Wilson, \ . To—Foreign Office, Lo»don( repeated Tehran and Bushire). My telegram of October 21st, from Khurramabad. I beg that the purport of the following may be communicated to Mr. Greenway I arrived at Dizful to-day with Douglas, after traversing the Kashgan gorge which appears to afford an alignment which, though rather expensive, is in my opinion, for what it is worth, far more suitable and cheaper than the more westerly alternative I was originally responsible for suggesting. I have concluded remaining agreements with tribes and arranged for pay ments of subsidies up to the end of the current month. Captain Crosthwaite, my successor, to whom I hand over to-morrow will make arrangements in conjunction with Mr. Whitelaw for future action. The total sums expended by me tQtdate.Qut of my own pocket on behalf of the Syndicate in connection with Douglas’ journey and for the payments up, to the end of the current month of subsidies amount to a total of some 7,800 tumans. Your Mohammerah Agents have been given the accounts and have, 1 hope, by now been told to refund. I have given them a copy of the foregoing. Telegram, No. 3, dated 9th November 1913. From— Captain Crosthwaite, Dizful, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Whitelaw is wiring to Pearsons as follows :— Begins. “ Douglas and Wilson arrived 8th November both well.

If so, we await here his arrival if not delayed too long otherwise will start for Khurramabad on Wilson’s agreements with tribes under which we hppe to get through. Wilson recommends us avoid one tribe 15 miles from Dizful with 20 miles of territory and survey slightly more difficult route out of their lands ; this we shall do.” Ends. Whitelaw being satisfied I do not propose to raise any objections. Personally I see no reason to modify the conclusion arrived at in my letter No. 5.

There is no doubt as to the desirability of this from the standpoint of the interests of the Persian Railway Syndicate, but the feasibility of it depends on political considerations and the attitude of the Russian Government. I can do little more than commend the question to consideration. The latter portion of paragraph 2 of Captain Wilson's letter suggests that the Survey, if proceeded with, without further reference^ any body, could be pushed through without the Russian Legation hearing of it until it had been completed, when such explanations as were necessary could be given if questions were asked. Perhaps this possible alternative will also be considered. • The settlement of the question is a matter of some urgency to the Railway Syndicate. I trust that if possible any instructions that may issue on this reference will be telegraphic. I am venturing to send a copy direct to His Majesty’s Foreign Office as well as to the Government of India, for information.

In any case, owing to the normal absence of telegraphic communica tion between Burujird and the rest of Persia, it is unlikely that the Russian Gov ernment would hear of the survey (through their native Agent at Burujird) until sometime after its completion. Telegram, Foreign Office to His Majesty’s Minister, No. 89, dated the 24th March 1911 :— ' His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh will inform Russian Government that Wilson on termination of his survey will visit Burujird as an ordinary traveller, but will of course make no sur vey in the Russian sphere unless they wish him to do so ” • Vide stage 2, route No. 8, Military Report on South-West Persia, Volume V. 3 It will be remembered that I was prohibited in 1911 from surveying north of Khurramabad although as a matter of fact for at least 32 miles along the align ment which would, I believe, be approxi mately followed by a railway, to the Chavireh Shah Pass,* if not beyond, the line would lie south of the Russian sphere. 4. I have little doubt that it will be possible to make suitable arrangements for the safe conduct of the survey party between Khurramabad and Burujird, parti cularly if the former town is reached by the end of March, and I have already entered into preliminary negotiations on the subject with the Chiefs of the p inci- pal tribes concerned and received satisfactory assurances. 5.

Mohammerah to Khurramabad railway must be extended at least as far as Burujird, and I understand that the Directors of the Persian Railway Syndicate are of the same opinion. For this reason it would seem of great importance that use should be made of the present favourable opportunity to obtain, at a small additional cost, full details with regard to the extension in question, particularly as there is some reason to think (v:de paragraph 56 of my report above quoted) that it would be even more difficult and expensive to construct than the Dizful-Khurramabad section.

October 5th .—Struck camp and sent off caravan under a small guard at 8-30. Went to see the Sardar Akram as 'soon as he was awake, at 9-30 A.M. though he had signed the agreement regarding escorts for the Kashgan gorge the evening before, and thought it well to recapitulate the main points verbally, and it was well I did so, as it was clear that he had not understood the purport of the document. He raised all sorts of difficulties regarding our projected journey through the Kashgan gorge, alleging it to be impassable, unsafe, desolate, etc., finally however he assented and gave the necessary orders to the guards. My final argument, which appeared to carry conviction with him and his adherents, was that the Almighty had found a way through the gorge for His waters, and we were convinced that by trusting in God and following the same route we should find a way for a railway. This is in reality or somewhat free translation of the railway engineer’s maxim that a location should follow the main lines of drainage. We took our leave at about 10-30, the Sardar at once striking camp and proceeding towards the Kakawand country. A short march of 3 hours brought Rout. 99. Routes in Persia, Volume III, Stage US tO Laghfi, the Badawatl rivet being 5 * crossed at about 8 miles. We here struck Major E. B. Burton’s route of 1897 which enabled us to locate our position fairly accurately. A special messenger on the evening of October 4th brought news that a party of 150 horsemen of the Falak-ud-Din, who had killed two men on the Warazan pass a day or two before, had raided the vicinity of Nihawand on the evening of the day of our departure thence and carried off a number of donkeys. A few sowars gave chase but without recovering any of the animals ; the only casualties reported were one horse killed and one sowar wounded in the foot. When a large town like Nihawand, boasting of 1,000 riflemen and several hundred sowars, is unable to send out more than a handful to recover stolen property, and when the said handful is content- to return empty handed with no casualties worth speaking of, it is not a matter of surprise that Lurs find it a profitable game to raid the district. News was also received, from a reliable source (Said-ul-Nizam of Burujird) that the Bairanwand Khans bad undoubtedly intended to induce us to go through their country by false promises, friendly letters, etc., and then hold us as ransom for their friends captured by the gendarmerie. The feeling on this subject is so strong that I fear it will be some years before we can prudently enter into practical relations with the Bairanwand on a basis of mutual confidence, as we are doing or have done with other tribes. During the evening special messenger sent to Diwan Begi, Beglerbegi, news was received in our camp at Laghri that the Khurramabad by the Sardar Akram with letters to the Fathullah and Abbas Khan Judeki, and the Baharwand | C109FDKadkhudas, enjoining them to render me every assistance, had been stripped by some Lurs in the Tang-i-Gau Shumar (on our road for to-morrow) and the letters torn in pieces, apparently with no object except wanton mischief. October 6th .—Left Laghri (y^oo') at : a cold morning. On the way some of my sowars went to a hamlet to get bread: they tried to get it without payment but were refused. Shots were exchanged and in the scuffle that followed the mare of the head sowar strayed or was stolen. Half the party stayed behind to look for it, so I had a small escort only during the passage of the Tang-i-Gau Shumar which was alleged to be dangerous. This gorge which has not been visited by Europeans before, is a long defile through the Kuh-i-Safid, whereby the Kashgan (formed by the confluence of the Ab-i-Alishtar (Khaman) and the Laghri stream) obtains access to the Chigini plateau (a continuation to the west of the Khurramabad plain). It is an important defile, all roads for many miles east and west being very steep and almost impracticable for laden animals. There were, as is usual in most important gorges in South-West Persiai relics of a Sassanian road through the gorge: the track however is now bad and several mules had to be unloaded. We halted at 3 P.M. in the Tang: during the afternoon a violent dispute arose amongst the sowars whose headmen had appropriated a proportion of their daily salary, which had been paid ten days in advance. We had a pleasant, if somewhat chilly, bathe in the Kashgan before tea. October 7M.—Left camp at 7 A M. and started the steep ascent of Rikh Kuh, rising 2,500' to 8,ooo' in 1J miles : from the top of the hill we had a fine view in every direction to the north, the range forming the northern boundary of Luristan and overshadowing Nihawand were visible: to the south Kialan Kuh the southernmost range of Luristan was just distinguishable. To the south and west over 3,ooo / below, we could see the Kashgan winding through low hills on its way south, a portion of its course hitherto unexplored. After steep descent of 3,000' in two miles brought us to valley level, after which the road was easy to Tishkhin, a well watered district at the foot of the Safid Kuh, owned (nominally) by Sardar Akram, occupied by the adherents of Ibrahim Khan Shirawand, a sub-section of the Chigini tribe. Here we found the Diwanbegi and Beglerbegi (Joint Deputy Governors ex officio of Khurramabad) awaiting our arrival with some 30 sowars. I had origi nally asked them to Burujird to meet me, but the vagaries of the gendarmes under Major Skjaldebrand made this impossible for them, and I therefore asked them to meet me here. They have more influence than anyone else with the Chigini and exercise certain moral influence over other tribes : but even so they have little real power outside the walls of the town. I was suitably welcomed by all concerned on my arrival, and Ibrahim Khan did his best to produce wheat bread, barley, straw, etc., but with little success, as by breakfast time the horses and mules w 7 ere feeding on maize, and we on maize bread, whilst there was no straw for the horses at all. I held a reception of the various elders, greybeards, Khans, Kadkhudas, etc., in the evening before dark, during the course of which one Kadkhuda Kazim, re presenting an important section, took occasion to intimate politely that my 20 Chigini sowars (supplied by the Sardar Akram) were all from one half of the tribe, and that unless the other half, which he represented, w r as admitted to participa tion, there would be trouble. The section he represented was allied to the one which partially looted my caravan in the same district some 27 months earlier, whilst it was being escorted ^ my Diary for June 1 ath. by sowars belonging to the other half, so n Ifith*, lett6r Forei 2 n i there was reason to think that the mal contents were prepared to make good their threats. • ^ ues ^ on was discussed at length later in the evening w r ith the Diwan begi and Beglerbegi, with the result that 10 or so of the malcontents accom panied us next morning, the precise amount of their reward being left for sub sequent settlement.October 8th —Left Tishkin about 9 A.M. ; the caravan escorted by • some under the Beglerbegi went to the Dureh stream and camped near of Saiyid Nazar/ We took a different route, accompanied by Diwan- begi and some 40 sowars, visiting the ruin of an ancient bridge across the Kash- gan en route. Here I connected up with my old 1911 rou f e. For a description of this bridge see page 204-205 De Morgan and page 7 Mil. Report on South-West Persia, Volume V. (Luristan.) After a noisy dispute, which looked at one time as if it might end seriously, T managed to induce all our escort to accompany us to the Tang-i-Tir (or Tireh) an important point on the projected Kashgan alignment. We photographed the aorge and took observations, with not unsatisfactory results; there is no road, not even a footpath through the gorge, which is only some 400 y ards lon /’ , but a difficult footpath runs up the hill and gets through at a height of some 600. We returned thence to our camp, some 4 miles distant, arriving at 4-30 P.M. October oth. —After a great deal of discussion during the previous evening, Mirza Ali Akbar managed to arrange for us to visit Pul-i-Kalhur, on the kas * tran some 8 miles south of Tang-i*Tir, accompanied by the Beglerbegi and some riflemen under the leadership of Kadkhuda Shamsali, Wt^camp of the Chigini to which this part of the Kashgan val ey belOTgs.

It was fortunately settled, after much shouting and brandishing of knives and rifles, without bloodshed, and we reached our camp a little before 8 P.M. without further incident. The occurrence however serves to emphasize the fact that in 1913, to a greater extent even than in 1911, headmen have little control over their adherents, and a few malcontents can easily render valueless agreements that have been signed, sealed and delivered (in return for valuable consideration) by their nominal chiefs, who are afraid to exercise any real authority. October 10th .—Left camp about 9 A.M. for Khurramabad, accompanied by the Diwanbegi, Beglerbegi, my own escort (30 men) and representatives of all the six branches of the Chigini tribe, with most of their leaders: as a special precaution, the son of the headman of the Fathullahi sub-section, through whose lands we had to pass, was present, and it was further arranged that we should lunch in the tents and be accompanied to the town by Kadkhuda Kazim, head man of another sub-section. To prevent further mischief, every sub-section had been told they would share in the trial subsidy to be granted in connection with the movements of the survey party, and were promised something on account in advance. Nevertheless, no sooner had our cavalcade entered the lands of the Fathullahi, then 4 or 5 armed men came up from the fields and began to make mischief, firing shots only a yard or so in front of us and threatening actual bloodshed unless we stopped. The elders and notables with me displayed admirable discre tion as also did the 100 sowars in their train: no attempt was made to use more than moral suasion to prevent the malcontents from proceeding to violence and I fear that, but for the presence of the elders and notables and their baggage, our gallant sowars would have sought safety in flight, leaving us to negotiate personally with the riflemen. Some elders beseeched me to go on, others were equally importunate in their advice to me to go back. Finally the son of the headman of the Fathulla section managed to induce the malcontents, by sweet words and promises of subsequent rewards, to permit us to pass. The Fathullah clan were responsible for robbing me within a few miles of this spot in 1911, and doubtless wished to repeat the process (not having been punished in any way for it): they had not heard of, or had disregarded, the presence of their chiefs with me. The incident affords a further example of the difficulties which attend European travel in Luristan. An hour later we reached the tents of Kadkhuda Kazim and after a long delay had lunch: a further delay was necessitated by the non-arrival of Fathullah Khan, joint chief (with Abbas Khan) of the Judeki. On his arrival I interviewed him, his brother, Abbas Khan’s son, and two headmen named Kikha* Muhammad and Gul Muhammad. It was agreed that Fathullah should depute Abbas Khan as his fully empowered agent to come to the town to make an agreement with me, Fathullah being unable to do so, he or his adherents having recently robbed a town caravan. J Maving obtained his signature to a power of attorney, I started again for Khurramabad : a large “istiqbal ” of some 50 men met us some 5 miles from the .T’ j e,a 1 ^ . 1 ullah Khan, brother of the Diwanbegi, a cheery rascal who is hand-m-glovc with the Bairanwand and other arch-brigands as also is Sardar Khan, who was likewise in our train. I hope to take one of these two to Dizful to return with the survey party) on the principle of setting a thief to catch a At 4 miles from the town a deputation of Chigini ' Khans ” (ousted by their o lowers a generation or so ago and now separated from the tribe) met us open- mouthed and servilely obeisant for the expected reward which th ese beastly In Luristan Kikha and Kadkhuda are used synonymously..5- ceople demand as their right, apart altogether from any so-called “ services’’ rendered : they were told to come with us to the town and to remain hopeful. Dissatisfied, they seized the horse and rifle of one of the Diwanbegi’s retainers, and a further noisy quarrel arose which Saifullah Khan succeeded in quelling,’ not by force, but by promises of rewards in the town. In this case, as in previous ones, no one showed the smallest resentment at the spectacle of an important and strongly armed cavalcade being held up by a few ragged malcontents with guns. We reached the town soon after sunset, the sowars of my escort showing considerably more energy in chasing small boys out of the way than they had displayed during the various incidents of the day. October iith *—Halt at Khurramabad. We were accommodated in the house of Mirza Mahmud Mustaufi, it being feared that were either the Diwanbegi or Beglerbegi to put us up, it would lead to ill-feeling and jealousy on the par whichever individual was not so privileged.

Abbas Khan, joint chief of the Judeki. Barani of the Muradaliwand (=Baharwand) Dirakwand. Hussain AH, son of Husain Khan (Baharwand . Baksh AH, son of the late Yaqub ( do. )• ClOjFDThey were all friendly but inclined to press me to go down with the tribal, migration, in a fortnight’s time, and not at once, which would of course be very inconvenient. They likewise all wanted to have private talks with me alone, and were (unlike their brother N. of Khurramabad) rnclined to. ignore Mirza Ali Akbar and try to deal with me personally, as they knew little of the former. This, however, was plainly inadvisable, as I shall shortly be leaving the provihce, and I impressed on them (and on several small deputations at other times) that Mirza Ali Akbar was my Wazir and that they must deal with him, and with the Diwanbegi and Beglerbegi, in the first instance. I October !2th.—k meeting of all the Bala Gariweh headmen was held during the day : they adopted a new and unexpected line, i.e., that they wanted the railway to pass through the middle of their territories, so that they might benefit therefrom and not to one side as it would do via the Kashgan. ^ All their talk was of caravansarais and straw and barley and it seemed useless, if not dangerous, to try to convince them that the railway required none of these things : nor was I inclined, having regard to my past experiences of their trefid of thought, to lay emphasis on the benefits of rapid communication : the reply I well knew Would be “ our wives and adherents will run away by the railway—we will have none of it ” : as for the increased sale of their produce of wood, grass, etc., their answer would be “we already have insufficient; we require all we have for ourselves—no one shall take it away or buy it There seemed a real danger.of their taking fright at the idea of a railway so I impressed on them, through Mirza Ali Akbar, that only a survey was now in progress and that when it was question of beginning construction it would be time enough for them to consider their attitude to it. There was a fight amongst the Chigini chiefs in the evening over the divi sion of the money they had received, and several were wounded. Husain Khan Bairanwand left in the evening with a draft agreement for the Bairanwand to sign, on the lines of the Chigini agreement so as to “ keep them hopeful At dusk we went to inspect houses, the object being— 1. To lease a house for the use when in Khurramabad of the Luristan Officer—on a three years’ lease. 2. To obtain a house for the use when in Khurramabad of the survey party —for say a month. The task was complicated by the fact that all available suitable houses are out of repair, whilst it was inexpedient to take houses belonging to either of the principal factions in the town, for fear of annoying the other faction. Abbas Khan Judeki and Mir Haji (Baharwand Mirs) came to see tne secretly after dark : the upshot of a long conversation was that they, as import ant chiefs, wanted special allowances and guarantees. 1 did not coffrVnit myself to anything, but asked them how such a proposal was reconcileable with the fact that— 1. If it was known to others that they were in receipt of special treatment, trouble would be caused. 2. There was a strong faction hostile to them but whom they were powerless to influence for good. They showed strong inclination to oppose any idea of having a road, iron or otherwise, anywhere except along the old caravan route, but I think they will vllie^nrnv^ 6 ^ 4 . 0 - 1 ^ SUrVey P art &gt;: doln g w . ha t 't likes along the Kashgan \ alley, provided that it does not prejudice the railway question. I was informed this evening that on the previous night two Bairanwand n h ; e ;r:-r U t ght ? the a I‘ 0 makm § a hole in the wal1 of ™ adjacent dwell- mg with a view to entering the courtyard of our house. 1k October /^A.—News was received that Ihe persons captured in Burujird, including persons, Khurrumabadis ; a paper signed by countersigned by me relating to one of them the gendarmes had executed 14 of one or two undoubtedly innocent the local authorities in Burujird and unfortunately arrived too late. Another man, Burujird tradesman Kambar begi, was about to be executed when a similar paper also countersigned by me reached Sultanabad : he was at once released. If the Swedish Officers think they are going to improve matters in Luristan I -or elsewhere by raiding a town, scraping together a few odd Lurs, who are no more guilty than their fellows of any particular offence, and in some cases are plainly innocent, and executing them, they are much mistaken. Certainly my own position m Lunstan and that of the British generally has been for the time being prejudiced, as it is everywhere known that the gendarmes are our own creation and are supported by us. 1 he news had an unfortunate effect on the morning meeting of the Bala Gariweh chiefs and we made no progress in coming to an agreement with them,' In the afternoon news was received that the three Bairanwand chiefs wished to come to Khurramabad to meet me: 1 understood that their main object is to express contrition for past misdeeds, and promise to do all I wish in future, in order to get me to support an application to the Swedish gendarmerie for the release of Qasim Khan, son of ^ohrab Khan Sagwand, a relation by marriage (nephew) of Ali Mardan Khan Bairanwand, Salar Muzaffar. Had the gendarmerie executed this man at once with the 14 others, they would have done well, but not having done so and having run away from Burujird, they have been placed in a difficult position. In the evening I went to Beglerbegi's house to meet a selected deputation of the Bala Gariweh chiefs. They announced that they were prepared, in so far as our affairs were con- * cerned to sink their tribal feuds and to give hostages in Dizful for their good behaviour. As regards the railway, if Shaikh Khazal supported railway cons- struction, they would do likewise, if not they would oppose it : whatever terms Khazal agreed to they would also agree to (rhetorically only, I think) : they wanted a letter or telegram from him reassuring them, which they could show to their dependents, to show the latter that their chiefs were not acting inadvisedly. I promised to obtain them a letter from “Khazal ” (as Lurs, like Arabs, familiarly call him). As I have remarked in a previous diary, wherever I go in South Persia I find Shaikh Khazal’s name invoked as a standing example of a tribal chief who has assisted British enterprise and has reaped his reward. Some are jealous of his power, and many envy his position, but all recognize that his position to-day, compared with his position 20 years ago, when he succeeded to the Shaikhship is Sufficient justification for a policy of active encouragement to British enter prise : and Persians have not failed to remark to me that no counterpart exists m I North Persia, except perhaps Shuja-ud-Dauleh, who is a very poor imitation (from their point of view). The Bala Gariweh chiefs did not commit themselves as to giving hostages to Khurramabad on which I insisted. As regards their salaries and subsidies they asked for tomans 30,000 a year, or proportionately per mensem : this works out at something like ^500 a month for them alone, which is a good deal more than I am prepared to recommend the Syndicate to pay : doubtless we can effect a reduction in their demands later on.-e~ The present line of division amongst the chiefs of the various tribes is as follows :— — Muradaliwand. Kurdaliwand. Mirha. Judeki. Faction No. 1 ... ^ Baruni Hussain Khan ... Zohrab ... Mir Haji Mir Sarhang ... All. ' Faction No. 2 ... ’ Baksh Ali ... Jafar and brothers • •• Fathullah ••• Shir Muhammad •— ••• Mir Sardar Mir Iman ... Mir Tatar Mir Rustam Khan Mir Hatim Khan • •• ••• October 15th .—A letter was received in the morning from Ghulam Ali Khan, Bairanwand, Shuja-es-Sultaneh, expressing a desire to come to Khurram. abad to meet me and promising to sign the draft agreement : he stated that he would be staying near Burujird this winter and that he was building a fort. In a postscript he mentioned that Sardar Khan (a relation of his and of the Diwan- begi) a notorious local ruffian whom I proposed to take to Dizful with me, to be a Railway Syndicate head guard, in order to keep him out of mischief and to placate his fellows, had been imprisoned in Burujird by Haji Fakhr-ud-Din, Iftikhar-ul-Islam. Doubtless I shall be asked to take steps for his release. Sarhang Musa Khan Hasanwand called during the morning: I had gone out some three farsakhs to Rawat to lunch with him in 1911. He complained of the Sardar Akram’s behaviour to him. Negotiation with the Bala Gariweh continued during the morning and by noon they had agreed to a monthly subsidy of 800—1 ,ooo tomans to be shared between the Muradaliwand and Kurdaliwand sections of the Baharwand clan, and by the Mirs. The Judeki to be dealt with separately. Influential chiefs to receive separate subsidies : the subsidy to be payable so long as the Syndicate were in their territories. A rumour was current in the town in the afternoon that some gendarmes had reached Burujird. There was a tribal scuffle in the evening in the course of which Kadkhuda Baksh Ali of the Muradaliwand got severely knocked and one Khurramabadi was killed. October 16th .—Our special messenger arrived from Burujird during the day: the letters brought included letters of congratulation, somewhat belated, on my arrival at Burujird from Ghulam Ali Khan and Ali Mardan Khan Bairanwand, and another letter from Saiyid Husain Said-ul-Nizam, son of an ex-Wazir of Khurramabad and a brother-in-law of the Sardar Akram, to a like effect, incidentally mentioning that he would like to be employed in some capacity by us. A detailed report by they were attacked by • 300 tomans in notes. II rifles, 5 magazine. 7 rifles, Mauser. Cartridges, i load, bedding, I load. Tents, Officer’s, I load. Medical stores, i load. Maxim gun fittings, i load. Horse i. Mules 4. Saddles (of! dead horses). Said-ul-Nizam who was with the Bairanwand when the gendarmes, stated that the following articles were captured from the latter* and that 4 gendarmes were killed. I have already seen one gendarmerie rifle in Bairanwand hands. The report states that it was generally believed that I had instigated the gendarmes to attack the Bairanwand, as my arrival at Burujird coincided with the event.A later message dated 13th October stated that the Bairanvvand were meditating entering into negotiations with the notables of Khurramabad and with the Dirakwand for the surrender of Captain Wilson, Mr. Douglas and Mirza Ali Akbar, to be held as hostages against the balance of prisoners in the hands of the gendarmerie. It was reported that the Mardan Khan had offered 10,000 tomans to the gendarmerie for the release of the prisoners, but it had been refused, and the return of all loot taken from the people of Irak and the Malik-ut-Tujjar of Ispahan (who was seized and held to ransom for 15,000 tomans) was demanded. The condition of Burujird is pitiable: Lurs have gained access by night to parts of the town and ransacked several houses; three or four more people killed on the outskirts ; 150 loads looted from a Kermanshah caravan on the Daulatabad-Sultanabad road, and other robberies on a smaller scale else where. Meanwhile the gendarmes are occupied (no doubt to the gratification of the Lurs) in depriving the villages of Irak of their arms, their sole defence against brigands from whom the gendarmes are quite unable to protect them. It is anticipated that in a fortnight’s time or so when the Bairanwand have migrated southwards, the Persian Government will despatch a force of gendarmes or others to Burujird, which will be in a position to announce that it has restored order (the disturbers of the peace having left as usual for their winter quarters). My negotiations with the Bala Gariweh during the day centred on the question of hostages. They promised to provide them in Dizful, but not here: I at first stipulated Tor Nasiri instead of Dizful, but finding this impracticable, gave way, but insisted on hostages being provided at Khurramabad, to be retained until we had taken delivery of the hostages at Dizful. The chiefs declined to do this and every sort of argument was brought to bear to induce me to give way. October i*]th. —Baruni, a chief of the Muradaliwand and an old friend sought an interview at 8 A.M. : I refused to see him sending a message to the effect that if he was a true friend he should offer his son as hostage, but this and other means failed to induce anyone to provide them at Dizful and finally it was arranged that the following documents should be drawn up and sealed by the Bala Gariweh chiefs :— 1. A Quran to be sealed by the Baharwand declaring that in so far as the survey party was concerned, they would put tribal quarrels on one side. 2. A Quran to be sealed by the Mirs to a similar effect. 3. A Quran to be sealed by both Baharwand and Mirs promising to observe the agreement (4) sealed by them, to provide hostages at Dizful and to demand nothing additional to what is provided for in the agreement. 4. An Agreement to be sealed by both Baharwand and Mirs detailing their obligations and the amounts to be received from us. 5. An Agreement to be sealed by the Judeki to the same effect and also a Quran as (3) above. 6 . An Agreement to be sealed by the Divvanbegi and Beglerbegi of Khurramabad, whereby the former accompanies us to Dizful and back with the survey party with 16 sowars at 5 Krans a day each, with the Beglerbegi’s son and the Beglerbegi himself to act as our Agent at Khurramabad. 7 A written certificate from the Beglerbegi that he is satisfied with the documents (1) to (5) above and makes himself responsible for the signatories. Translations of these documents will submitted separately. October 18th —Further negotiations with the Bala Gariweh continued dnrinp’ the day : at the last moment they declared themselves unable to leave before October 26th (instead of 21st) and unable to guarantee my arrival at Dizful before November 17th (instead of 5th).4 A deputation of the chiefs came to see me in the afternoon to explain their views on this and other matters and after a protracted wrangle I was unable to get them to do more than promise (on the Quran) to be at Dizful by the 14th November; though I offered them every sort of inducement, financial and other wise. Their reason for delaying is mainly fear of the Qalawand, with whom they had a bitter blood feud, arising out of or rather culminating in a fight in which several (it is said 12) on both sides were killed and wounded, amongst the latter being Kadkhuda Hatim, popular leader in the tribe, who was struck in the face by a bullet blinding him in one eye and disfiguring him. They are afraid to approach this tribe with a small force and wish to pass by it in full strength, accompanying their flocks, herds and tents. Most of the chiefs sealed the various oaths on the Quran and the agreement in the afternoon, but a few who held back will it is hoped sign to-morrow. October 79///.—After much difficulty the rest of the chiefs (the Judeki excepted) sealed the agreements and oaths after a protracted discussion as I had stipulated for a fortnight advance only ; I succeeded, however, much against their will, in adhering to the stipulation that their pay was to date from our departure, and not from the signature of the agreement. Further difficulties arose over the question of 10 per cent payable by the chiefs, in accordance with previous precedent and custom to the Beglerbeo-i and Uiwanbegi of Khurramabad. I claimed that as these functionaries were afready in receipt of a handsome salary from the Syndicate they were not entitled to the benefit of this rebate, on which the chiefs insisted. In the afternoon negotiations began with the Judeki : Abbas Khan provine recalcitrant I sent htm a message to the effect that I had stood ten days of abblmg and procrastination from his fellows of the Dirakwand, and now that they had signed and the principles and details of the work were settled, I was h t:e P ^V?h San f V n L n ° nSenSefromhlm ' that 1 Could do without him ° r hint f .t d ^- h V he dld , not accept '’y terms 1 would work on the opposite S,r ?'

October 21 si. —I wrote to the Qalawand chiefs in Qilat, 30 miles north of Dizful, telling them to send hostages to Oizful to be kept in safe custody pending our arrival, and having done so to meet us on our downward journey and conduct us to Dizful from near Qal’eh Riza md Qal’eh Husainiyeh. I also sent them an oath on the Quran for signature, and sent our mail by the same messenger. I wrote to Sagwand Khans (Fazil and Sadiq) near Dizful telling them to give every facility should the survey party wish to work in their territory and to defer discussion as to rewards, etc., till my arrival. I wrote to our Agent at Dizful (Shaikh Abul Hassan) instructing him, amongst other things, to get accommodation for Mirza Ali Akbar and the Diwanbegi’s sowars and to arrange for the retention in Dizful of the Qalawand hostages by A. Ali, Imdad ud-Daftar or otherwise. (Sd.) A. T. WILSON, Captain, I.A., Additional Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, on special duty in Khuzistan. Diary. From October 22nd 1913 to November 4th, 1913. October 22nd. —Various chiefs came in to Khurramabad to see me and endeavour to get “ robes of honour ”, including Mir ’Adil whose brother, Mir A’Ali, was killed in 1911 whilst endeavouring to get possession of me and my caravan with a view to looting it. Mir ’Adil informed Mirza 1 ar a e considered me responsible for the death of his brother and that he consequent y expected a reward from me. My reply was briefly that I did not admit either His premise nor his deduction, and that he having got his share of the 900 tomans, would get nothing more from me. A rumour reached Khurramabad to-day to the effect that “ the Regent has returned and has combined with the Bakhtiaris to fight the gendarmes and the Russians; the gendarmes were defeated and reinforcements have een s Tehran by the gendarmes in Iraq.” Incredible as it may seem, pieces of intelligence such as ;j’ 1S credence in Luristan; Bakhtiaris, Russians and gen armes a “ mash- the Lurs as so many tribes like themselves, and the words ma J lls “ ^ rutah ” signify amongst the average tribesmen some m y ste '2 n f c ToTconver- cal alike to ' daulat ” “ Islam ’’ and “ qanun It .s a commonplace of convey sation amongst them that “ the Constitution as ecom b , t b e the Government is on its feet again, and I am o e . . - n( j s are j n majlis are all Babis and backsliders from Islam”. oart icular arvi' this chaotic condition, it is not easy to predict what effect any particular ar &amp; u ments or action will produce. »=e 3 SSSKS© 5 S 5 € seeing God. , A , u „After a great deal of angry discussion he got his way and made Abbas Khan sign a new agreement, in which this was made quite clear, no mean feat on AH Akbar’s part: it remains to be seen whether Abbas Khan has any kick left in him. October 24th .—I obtained a supplementary undertaking from Saifullah Khan, the Diwanbegi’s brother, undertaking to behave in the latter’s absence and to co-operate with the Beglerbegi. I wrote a letter to the VVali of Pusht-i-Kuh informing him of our intentions with regard to the survey party, etc., and also of the proposed furco-Persian Frontier Commission, and asking him to arrange for supplies at certain points. Intimation was received that the Director General of Persian Post Offices had ordered the office at Khurramabad to be re-opened if possible. Persian administrations generally require a large staff and the Khurramabad Post Office is no exception ; it will consist of a Superintendent, a Postmaster, and Assistant Postmaster and a farrash, all in receipt of pay, and costing about three times as much as the staff of an Indian Post Office in the Gulf with 50 times as much work to do. October 25th .—Mir ’Adil and Mir Rustam were induced to seal the various Qurans and agreements : I did not pay them anything. A useful letter from A Rabbia, the Sardar Akram’s Wazir, to his brother, was shown me by the latter ; it contained injunctions to the Beglerbegi to assist us in every way. October 26th .—I caused a letter to be written to Ghulam AH Khan Bairan- wand by Mirza Ali Akbar telling him to behave himself and to be ready to be of service to the survey party in the spring. October 27th .—Left Khurramabad soon after midday, escorted by the principal Baharwand and Mir Chiefs and Abbas Khan Judeki; the Divvanbegi and his son (aged 14) and Mansur Khan, the Beglerbegi’s son (aged 12) and about 16 sowars were with us, as arranged, and the Beglerbegi went with us to the outskirts of the gardens round the town. At half way we were met by Baruni and Hatim of the Muradaliwand ; the latter was wounded in the spring in a tribal fight with the Qalawand, losing his nose and one eye. He was one of the best fighting men of his tribe and his mutilated condition tends to keep alive the bitterness of the blood-feud between the tribes even more than his death would have done. Our departure from Khurramabad was somewhat delayed by further demands for money from Baruni and Husain Khan ; they were satisfied with 100 Krans each, to be deducted from future emoluments. We camped at Shah in Shah 9 miles south of Khurramabad, near Kadkhuda Muradi of the Muradaliwand. October 28th .—Left Shah in Shah at 7-30 and proceeded by the old main caravan track to the Dadabad plateau, where we left the main track and turned south-west towards the Judeki country halting for the night at Sarab-i-Nusrat, a spring on the west side of a hill overlooking the western wing of the Dadabad plateau and draining towards Raikhan and Chimashk. We climbed the hill behind our camp in the afternoon and had a fine view north and south. October 2gtk .—Left Dadabad plateau at 7-20 and marched west-south west crossing the Raikhnn stream at 8 and entering the Marubeh district short ly afterwards, which lies at the north foot of Kuh-i-Ghaz’al. At 9 we reached the district of Sarsang or Marg Pahanah, amongst well wooded undulating foot-hills, occupied in spring by the Judeki. At this point a track to Khurramabad diverges north-east through the Tang-i-Arjanak to Shurab. We here turned south-west and ascended the Kuh-i-Ghaz’al by an easy track to a pass (7,400') where we were met by all the principal Kadkhudas and Chiefs of the Judeki except Fathullah Khan. A fine view was obtained south wards and westwards and we were able to take some observations. The descent on the southern side was difficult for our animals, and one mule slipped and rolled down the hill some 20 feet but luckily was prevented by some bushes from going further. Some knives, forks, cups, etc., were scattered on the ground and before my servant could reach the spot a dozen willing hands had collected various• i „ onrl nocketed them, before the eyes of their Chiefs. Abbas Khan f“ c ''p- i, a( j some of them searched and we got most of the things back. After h °difficult descent of 2 miles we reached the district of Mamulun and camped near Fathullah Khan’s tents at 5,200'. The Tudeki are poor in this world’s goods, and we could obtain neither barley or even maize for our animals, nor did we ourselves fare much better, a little meat being all we could obtain even on payment. Pothnllah Khan and Kadkhudas Gul Muhammad and Muhammad, who had ^ , Khan to conclude an agreement on their behalf, proved very empowered Abbas Kb nts m J e by the i atter and attempted to claim unwilling to agree to 0 “ the same scale as the Baharwand, or even the it* “ s -s ° &amp; lattet 't d twtomtirtr exactly as mucK as I was no' offering them, and that accepted 450 tomans or bY we should bave no difficulty m working along the^opposite (western or right) bank of the Kashgan, in his terntory, instead of along the left bank in Judeki territory. .

November 1st .—Left Muruni at 7-10 A.M., crossed the river by an easy ford to the right bank, where I joined up with my 191 1 route, which we followed to the ancient bridge known as PuI-i-Kurro Dukhtar, in the Tang-i-Khirsdarr reached at 8 miles. We crossed the river again here and crossed the plain of Waidar to Sarab Hamman, a spring of fresh water at the foot of low hills bound ing the plain to the south-east. We had intended to go on beyond this, but neither the Judeki riflemen with us, nor Husain Khan and Mir Haji were willincr to do so, and Husain Khan objected actively, so we camped here for the night S November W.—Left Sarab Hamman at 7-5 A M. and crossed the low range of hills which divides the Jaidar from the Chul plain which we skirted till th spring of Gurr Hushki was reached, at the foot of the Chul pass ; this proved to be bitter, so we went on over the pass and down to some springs “ Kunar-i-Bahlul’’ (or Bagh-i-Bahlul) about miles from the mouth o f the Tang-i-Fani. Mir Haji left us at Gurr Hushki, after extracting a reward for his invaluable services ; the combination of avarice and servility which is characteristic of Mir Haji is most unpleasant but unhappily only too common amongst his November 3rd.

We found some Qalawand messengers, with a Quran duly sealed by the Kadkhudas, and with our Dizful post, with letters of November 3rd. I sent a messenger to call the Qalawand Kadkhudas in to see us and discuss the agreement already communicated to them in outline. I also sent a messenger to Dizful. November The Qalawand Kadkhudas, including Fazil Babakhan, Zaqi Naqdi, AH Shah and Hazir Beg arrived at 9 A.M. and it was decided that we should go with them to Qaleh Husainiyeh, and finish the negotiations for an agreement there. I should have preferred to have waited 2 or 3 days for the Baharwand to represent in strength, to add force to our arguments, but I could not afford the delay. I could have avoided Qaleh Husainiyeh and the Qalawand altogether, and proceeded direct to Dizful, but this would have prevented Mr. Douglas from passing over an important part of the alignment. 1 0 have delayed coming to an agreement with them would have meant concluding it while we were at Dizful; but the Kadkhudas dare not come to Dizful, and to bring them there would involve much delay, even if it were possible. After much discussion, they undertook to sign an agreement on the same lines as the Baharwand, the monthly salary being 720 tomans, fixed on the ground that they are considered to be equivalent to fths of the Baharwand. No personal salaries were proposed. It is probable that, unless the Survey Party delay leaving Dizful. they will be out of Qalawand territory within the month, as they only run to a point some 3 miles east of Qal’eh Riza. November 67 /*.—Further negotiations took place with the Qalawand during the early morning, with the result that the monthly salary was raised to 800 tomans (but not payable for a second month unless the Survey Party is still in their lands, and then fortnightly). They at first refused to allow us to leave till we had paid the money, but /ere eventually content to keep the Diwanbegi as a hostage. They accom- •anied us some 8 miles towards Dizful to War i-Zard, where they camped pend- ag the receipt ot the money from Dizful. Here we were rejoined by the Bahar- /and Kadkhudas, and proceeded to Dizful. I was met some way outside th own bv a large “ istiqbal ” of some 70 or 80 sowars, including the sons of all :hief men an^d representatives of various mahallahs ; Sadiq Khan Sagwand was also present.

It is sincerely to be hoped that the railway survey operations will suffer no check from the punitive measures against the Lurs carried out by the gendarmerie, and every effort will be made to assist rather than to impede their work. The people of Sultanabad are loud in their praise and expressions of gratitude for the relief afforded them by the gendarmerie. iNot a day passes that some Persian of position, owning property in the provinces does not express his appreciation of the good work done in various directions by the gendarmes One occasionally hears complaints of high-handed behaviour on the pa r of native officers and inen, but so far I have been unable to get any serious charge o this nature substantiated. Colonel Hjalmarson is fully alive to this evil, and^has pointed out to me that it would not be reasonable to expect that this essentially Persian weakness to wish to make one’s power felt, when in a position to do so, can be eradicated in a few months. Severe punishments are inflicted upon offenders, and it is hoped that by degrees the officers and men of the gendarmerie may be taught that power is not put into their hands to make a bad use of it. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. [1967 p—3]A?) A\ Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Diary from September 25 to October 5 , 1913 . Burujird. September 25.—Spent the greater part of the day receiving and paying calls. The proceedings at these ceremonies were more like “ fatiha-khaneh ” (funeral services) than social gatherings. Several Lurs were killed during the day by Lurs on the outskirts of the town. Corpses could not be taken for burial, and one body which the Lurs secured was found later with the teeth smashed, stripped, and thrown to the dogs, an incident which serves to show how bitter are the feelings aroused amongst the Lurs by the recent gendarmerie raid. Two villages in the neighbourhood were sacked this day. One was destroyed after it had been sacked, the beams of the houses being burned or carted off for sale in the neighbourhood by the Lurs. The smallest show of unity amongst villagers would make this latter step impossible, but unfortunately they are unable to resist the temptation of buying looted goods cheap. September 2(i.—Both to-day and yesterday there was some firing by night, and the gendarmerie raid has undoubtedly increased local insecurity : further attacks by Lurs on villages in the neighbourhood were reported. Letteis from Bairanwand chiefs to local notables indicated that they proposed to make use of my proposed journey to Khoremabad via their country to force the Persian Government to hand back the prisoners captured. It is to be hoped that when the Persian Government take in hand the restoration of order here no mercy will be shown to the Bairanwand tribesmen or to their chiefs. The districts within 50 miles of Burujird have been so harried by them that years must elapse before they can recover themselves. The chiefs have grown rich and own land and villages, a circumstance which should assist the Persian Government in its task, for the confiscation of these ill-gotten gains would be an easy matter and would produce an immediate effect, though nothing short of the execution of the principal khans can be considered adequate penalty for the misery they have caused. September 27.—I concluded an agreement with the British consular agent, Mirza Ali Akbar, whom I propose to take down to Dizful, to act as intermediary between the Syndicate’s engineers and Lur chiefs, and as general factotum. It was stipulated that he should be paid at the rate of 1,000 krans (270 rupees) a month from the 1st October, with 1,300 krans a month for all expenses. This seems a high rate of remuneration, but he is a fairly prosperous merchant, who has recently married money, and I know of no one else suitable for the purpose. Mr. Soane’s illness made it essential to obtain the services of some intermediary. September 28.—I had hoped ai«i it had been arranged for me to leave Burujird to-day, ostensibly for a night or two, to visit the village of Wannai, but really en route to Nihavand, whence to Harsin, or wherever the Sardar Akram might be, in order to obtain an escort from him to take us to Khoremabad, the direct route from Burujird along the projected railway alignment being impracticable owing to the vagaries of the gendarmerie already recorded. But a renewed outburst of Lur raids near the town made it impossible. September 29.—Left Burujird for Wannai, accompanied by the Gudarzi chiefs and others; spent the night in a village of theirs, after lunching with a number of Gudarzi khans. I heard of petroleum oil springs, coal and lead mines in the vicinity. During the afternoon a timely messenger arrived with replies from Prince Ihtisham-ud-Dauleh of Nihavand, inviting me to visit him, and from the Sardar Akram, enclosing letters to the Bairanwand advising them to behave themselves and give me all facilities, adding jn his letter to me that if I thought them unreliable he v ould gladly arrange to see me through to Khoremabad or elsewhere via Khara and ishtar. 1 had already decided on this route, and made these letters my excuse for ea\ ing next day for Nihavand, to the surprise of my hosts, who thought, like every one eise, that I was going to Khoremabad with the Bairanwand. September o0. -To Nihavand; entertained by Prince Ihtisham-ud-Dauleh, who wrote a letter to the Sardar Akram advising him to meet my requirements in every wa;y. lie asked me to send him a copy of Layard’s “ Early Adventures,” in which are numerous references to his father, and I promised to send him one. I have since ordered a copy to be sent to him direct from London bound in leather.3 October 1. 1 rince Ihtisham paid a return call first thing in the morning. He referred to the presence in Nihavand of a certain Count Ledekesh de Beaufort a traveller and pseudo-savant, whose connection with the French “ Mission scientifique en 1 erse is not clear. Jt appears that this gentleman was anxious to visit Luristan tor arc ecological purposes. I had met him in Ahwaz in April, and was not favourably Wimpressed with him After some private conversation with me the Prince informed me that he had decided to tell the Count that before he could permit him to proceed to Luristan, the permission of the Farman Farma and of the Persian Government must be formally sought and obtained. f. ieac ^ e( J ^riswan, the village of Salar Nizam in the afternoon, being escorted out of. hawand a large escort of some fifty sowars and met at Pariswan by about thirty. J October 2—Left Pariswan accompanied by the Salar in person and some fifty sowars and ascended the Khatun Bah Pass to over 10,000 feet. We here parted with our escort (and with a good deal of hard cash 1 ', and after enjoying the magnificent view southwards, proceeded to the southern foot of the pass, and thence to a village where the Sardar Akram s iskitbal awaited us. It consisted of the usual complimentary led horses yadaq j, mace-bearers, sfandard-bearer, and drum-major, with a pair of drums attached to his saddle-bow, which he beat continuously, with some seventy well- armed sowars (sic). The Sardar’s camp, 4 miles away, was reached in an hour’s time, in in a large if!i Akbar the health wished to a valley called Sanjabi. We were cordially received by the Sardar Akram tent of Swiss cottage pattern (Indian make). After lunch he paid a return call on me, only his little sons and Mirza being present. He soon got to business, and after a cordial enquiry after of Captain Lorimer, he turned to the business of the day, saving that he confirm to me verbally all that he had written in 1911 as to his readiness to co-operate with us in the matter of roads or railways through his territories. A translation of the agreement in question will follow. As regards railways, he said that he quite understood their advantages to him and to his people, and also their prospective disadvantages, which latter he described as increased vulnerability and increased opportunities for the Persian Government and its local officials to harry him and his tribe at pleasure. If this, he said, was what the newspapers meant when they said that railways always brought security, “ he was not taking any,” unless we could assure him that his position and rights and those of his people would be respected. Some further discussion followed, and on my pointing out that he was looking rather far ahead, there being at the moment no question of actual railway constuction, he asked me to give him an undertaking that construction would not begin in his territories without his consent, I assented to this, and a translation of my note to him to this effect will follow. October 3.—Halted at Sanjabi and had further discussions with the Sardar Akram. He was still apprehensive of the effect of the railway on his position and that of his tribes. Pie made constant reference to Sheikh Kbazal of Mohammerah, who is to the Sardar Akram, as he is to so many other chiefs and notables I have met, the exemplar of a man who has assisted the British and in turn been assisted by them. Finally, I told him the gist of the Sheikh’s undertaking with regard to land required for railway purposes ; this seemed to relieve his mind, and he said he would follow the example thus set. After further discussion he agreed to sign a detailed agreement regarding guards for the survey party and for ourselves, for such portion of the route to be. surveyed as lies within his territory. A translation of this agreement will follow. He also agreed to renew the road agreement of 1911 and a declaration to tins effect was obtained from him. October 4.—The Sardar Akram sealed the agreements in the morning and sent letters to various people counselling them to fall in with my wishes. Some fuither discussion took place regarding British claims against the Kakawand. October 5.—Left in the morning for Laghri, cn route for Khoremabad, vide next * * I,U ‘ N ’ A. T. WILSON, Captain (on special duty).4 Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Dianj 'from October 5 to October 19, 1913* October 5.—Left Sardar Akrams camp and proceeded to Laghri with escort of^ thirty men provided by Sardar. October 6.—Left Laghri at 7‘15. On the way some of my sowars went to a hamlet to get bread; they tried to get it without payment but were refused. In the scufHe that followed the mare of the head sowar strayed or was stolen. Half the party stayed behind to look for it, so I had a small escort only during the passage of the Tang-i-Gau Shumar, which was alleged to be dangerous. This gorge, which has not been visited by Europeans before, is a long defile through the Kuli-i-Safid, whereby the Kashgan (formed by the confluence of the Ab-i-Alishtar (Khaman) and the Laghari stream), obtains access to the Chigini plateau (a continuation to the west of the Khorernabad plain). It is an important defile, all roads for many miles east and west being very steep and almost impracticable for laden animals. There were, as is usual in most important gorges in south-west Persia, relics of a Sassanian road through the gorge; the track, however, is now bad and several mules had to be unloaded. We halted at o p.m. in the Tang; during the afternoon a violent dispute arose, amongst the sowars, whose headmen had appropriated a proportion of their daily salary, which they had been paid ten days in advance. October 7. —Ascended Eikh Kuh pass ; a fine view from the top in every direction. A steep descent of 3,000 feet in 2 miles brought us to Tishkhin. Here we found the Diwanbegi and Beglerbegi (Governor and Deputy-Governor ex-officio of Khoremabad). awaiting our arrival with some thirty sowars. I had originally asked them to come to Burujird to meet me, but the vagaries of the gendarmes under Major Skjaldebrand made this impossible for them and I therefore asked them to meet me here. They have more influence than anyone else with the Chigini and exercise a certain moral influence over other tribes ; but even so they have little real power outside the walls of the town. I was suitably welcomed by all concerned on my arrival, and Ibrahim Khan did his best to produce wheat-bread, barley, &amp;c., but with little success. I held a reception of the various elders, greybeards, khans, &amp;c., in the evening before dark, during the course of which one Kadkhuda Kazim, representing an important section, took occasion to intimate politely that my twenty Chigini sowars (supplied by the Sardar Akram) were all from one half of the tribe, and that unless the other half, which he represented, was admitted to participation, there would be trouble. The section he represented was allied to the one which partially looted my caravan in the same district some twenty-seven months earlier, whilst I was being escorted by sowars belonging to the other half, so there was reason to think that the malcontents were prepared to make good their threats. The question was discussed at length, with the result that ten or so of the malcontents accompanied us next morning. October 8. —Left Tishkhin at 9 a.m. Visited ruins of an ancient bridge across the Kashgan ; vide De Morgan, p. 204-205. Also p. 7, “ Military lieport on South-West Persia,” vol. v. After a noisy dispute, which looked at one time as if it might end seriously, I managed to induce our escort to accompany us to the Tang-i-Tir (or Tirch) an important point on the projected Kashgan alignment. We photographed the gorge and took observa tions, with not unsatisfactory results ; there is no road* not even a footpath, through the gorge, which is only some 400 yards long, but a difficult footpath runs up through the hill and gets through at a height of some GOO feet. October 9. Visited Pul-i-Kalhur, on the Kashgan, some 8 miles south of Tang-i-Tir, accompanied by the Baglerbegi and some riflemen under the leadership of Kadkhuda ohams Ah of the Shah Karm section of the Chigini to which this part of the Kashgan va ey belongs. ^ We went over the Kuh-i-Baghileh (Boghelu of de Bode) from the razor- i.ce top of which we could see Imamzadeh Haiat Ghait, where de Bode stayed the ni ” 1 ^ ome years ago and which has not been visited by Europeans since. nee hours across shale hummocks and rocky foothills, mostly on foot, brought us &gt; ue luins of I ul-i-Kalhur. This bridge, I believe, has never been visited by Europeans before; De Morgan’s brief reference to it (p. 204-5) looks as if he had only &gt;e&lt;ir o it 10J11 native information. Had he visited it personally he would scarcely have missed the inscription.

The incident affords a further example of the difficulties which attend European travel m Lunstan. i bour ]ater we reached the tents of Kadkhuda Kazim where I met some Judki chiefs and arranged for them to depute a fully empowered representative to negotiate with me in Khoremabad, they being unable to do so, having recently robbed a town caravan. I left for Khoremabad soon after, being met some 5 miles from the town by a large “ istikbal” of some fifty men under Saifullah Khan, brother of the Diwanbegi, and Sardar Khan, a pair of cheerful rascals who are hand in glove with the Bairanwand and other arch brigands. I hope to take one of these two to^Dizful (to return with the survey party) on the principle of setting a thief to catch a thief. At 4 miles from the town a deputation of Chigini “khans” (ousted by their followers a generation or so ago) met us, open-mouthed and servilely obeisant for the expected reward, which these beastly people regard as their right, apart altogether from any so-called “ services ” rendered. They were told to come with us to the' town and to “ remain hopeful.” Dissatisfied, they seized the horse and rifle of one of the Diwanbegi’s retainers, [1967 p- 3 ] ° catid a further noisy quarrel arose which Saifullah Khan succeeded in quelling, not by force, but by promises of rewards in the town. In this case, as in previous ones, no one showed the smallest resentment at the spectacle of an important and strongly armed cavalcade being held up by a few ragged malcontents with guns. October 11.—Halt at Khoremabad. Negotiations proceeded as to the amount of reward to be paid on the spot to the Chigini khans, &amp;c., and the terms of their agreement as to the future were discussed and settled. As to the present, each “ tireh ” or branch of the tribe was to receive 25 tomans, making, with additions in the case of one or two chiefs, a total of about 2,200 krans (40k). I was not present at the distribution of the sum to the various chiefs, but understand that pandemonium reigned for some time after the cash had been handed to the petty chiefs. Some refused to take it, alleging that they expected a rifle and a few hundred tomans each, others blustered, whilst their supporters, anxious rather for casli in hand than for future benefits, tried to wrest the bag from their chiefs and get their share before it was too late. Finally they departed, a little depressed, but still hopeful (the important thing) of more bounteous largesse to come. A translation of the agreement made with them will follow. In the afternoon Husain Khan, brother of Ali Murdan Khan, Salar Muzaffar, Bairanwand, came to see me to take his leave and get his expected “khilat.” One of his retainers was armed with a captured gendarmerie rifle. He brought friendly messages from the Bairanwand who, disappointed at not getting hold of me as a hostage, apparently wish to make the best of a bad job by making friends I fell in with this plan, expressed my disappointment at having been deprived of the pleasure of seeing them, and begged him to invite them to come here to see me. He having, as I expected, replied that this was not practicable, I sent them friendly messages. J this will, 1 hope, assist in restoring the status quo ante the gendarmerie incident. It goes much against the grain to have any dealings wdth notorious brigands and murderers of this type, who have wrought so much misery within the last few months, | so huig as the survey party is in the province, it is necessary to keep on terms with all parties. If and when railway construction begins such a policy will no lono-er be practicable, and other measures must be devised ; but for the present it seems best ' 1° re ly&gt; for these few months, on the power of the purse. Negotiations with the Bala Garimeh chiefs began in the afternoon. I impressed on a alike that Mirza Ali Akbar was now my nazir, and that they must deal with him and with the Diw^anbegi and Beglerbegi in the first instance. Ocfo5c?H2.—-Further negotiations with the Bala Garimeh. They adopted a new am unexpected line, viz., that they wanted the railway to run through the middle of leir territories, so that they might benefit therefrom, and not to one side, as it would do via the Kashgan. All their talk was of caravanserais, straw, and barley, and it seemed useless if not dangerous to try to convince them that a railway required none + V ese {^ngs; nor was I inclined, having regard to my past experiences of their trend ot tnought to lay emphasis on the benefits of rapid communication, the reply I well vnew, would be, ‘‘ our wives and adherents will run away by the railway, we will have none ° 1 • s ^ t ^ e increased sale of their produce, and of wood, grass, &amp;c., their answer would be, We have insufficient; we require all we have for ourselves, and no one shall take it away or buy it.” There seemed real danger of their taking fright at the idea of a railway, so I ‘mpressed on them, through Mirza Ali Akbar, that only a survey was now in progress tlimn ! W ' e j lf \T a - a ( l'! estl0n of beginning construction it would be time enough for them to consider their attitude to it. the ar ^ on ^ s t the Chigini chiefs in the evening over the division of the money they had received, and several were wounded. officer d S ° en ^ ereC ^ ne r. 0 ^ a Ii° ns f° r the lease of a house for the Luristan inclinationme late in the evening.

C7 October 14. News was received that the gendarmes had executed fourteen of the persons captured in Burujird, including one or two undoubtedly innocent persons. A pap( i signed by the local authorities in Burujird and countersigned bv me relating to one of them, unfortunately arrived too late. Another man, a Burujird tradesman, was about to be executed, when a similar aper, also countersigned by me, reached Sultanabad ; he was at once released. If the Swedish officers think they are going to improve matters in Luristan or elsewhere by raiding a town, scraping together a few odd Lurs, who are no more guilty than their fellows of any particular offence, and in some cases are plainly innocent, and executing them, they are much mistaken. Certainly my own position in Luristan and that of the british generally has been for the time being prejudiced, as it is everywhere known that the gendarmes are our own creation and are supported by us. 1 he news had an unfortunate effect on the morning meeting of the Bala Garimeh chiefs, and we made no progress in coming to an agreement with them. In the evening I met a deputation of Bala Garimeh chiefs. They announced that they were prepared, in so far as our affairs were concerned, to sink their tribal feuds and to give hostages in Dizful for their good behaviour. As regards the railway if Sheikh * Khazal supported railway construction they would do likewise, if not, they would oppose it. W hatever terms Khazal agreed to they would also agree to (rhetorically only I think) ; they wanted a letter or telegram from him reassuring them, which they could show to Their dependents, to convince the latter that their chiefs were not acting inadvisedly. I promised them to obtain them a letttii* from “ Khazal ” (as Lurs, like Arabs, familiarly call him). As I have remarked in a previous diary, wherever I go in South Persia I find Sheikh Khazal s name invoked as the standard example of a tribal chief who has assisted British enterprise and reaped his reward. Some are jealous of his power and many envy his position, but all recognise that his position to-day, compared with his position twenty years ago, when he succeeded to the sheikhship, is sufficient justification for a policy of active encouragement to British enterprise. I he Bala Garimeh chiefs did not commit themselves as to giving hostages at Khoremabad, on which I insisted. As regards their salaries and subsidies, they asked for 30,000 tomans a year, or proportionately per mensem. This works out at something like 500b a month for them alone, which is a good deal more than I am prepared to recommend the syndicate to pay. Doubtless we can effect a reduction in their demands later on. News was received that Sardar Khan, a local ruffian whom I proposed to take to Dizful to be a Persian Bail way Syndicate headguard, in order to keep him out of mischief and to placate his fellows, had been imprisoned in Burujird by Haji Fakhr- ud-Dun Iftikhar-ul-Islam. Doubtless I shall be asked to take steps for his release. Negotiations with the Bala Garimeh continued during the morning, and by noon they had agreed to a monthly subsidy of 800 to 1,000 tomans, to be shared by the Bairanwand and Mirs. Judeki to be dealt with separately. Influential chiefs to receive separate subsidies ; subsidy to be payable so long as the syndicate were in their territories. October 16.—A detailed report by Said-ul-Nizam, who was with the Bairanwand when they were attacked by the gendarmes, stated that the following articles were captured from the latter and that four gendarmes were killed :— Three hundred tomans in notes, eleven rifles (five magazine), seven Mauser rifles, one load cartridges, one load bedding, one load officers’ tents, one medical stores, one load Maxim gun fittings, one horse, four mules, and seven saddles off dead horses. I I have already seen one gendarmerie rifle in Bairanwand hands. The report stated j that it was generally believed that 1 had instigated the gendarmes to attack the Bairanwand, as my arrival at Burujird coincided with the event. A later message, dated 13th October, stated that the Bairanwand were meditating entering into negotiations with the notables of Khoremabad and with the Birakwand for the surrender of Captain Wilson, Mr. Douglas, and Mirza Ali Akbar, to be held as hostages against the balance of prisoners in the hands of the gendarmerie. It was reported that Ali Mardan Khan had offered 10,000 tomans to the gendarmerie for the release of the prisoners, but it had been refused, and the return of all loot taken from the people of Iraq and the Malik-ut-Tujjar of Ispahan (who was seized and held to ransom for 15,000 tomans) demanded. ; • The condition of Burujird is pitiable : Lurs have gained access by night to parts cF8 °f the town and ransacked several houses; three or four more people killed on the outskirts; 150 loads looted from a Kermanshah caravan on the Daulatabad-Sultanabad road, and other robberies on a smaller scale elsewhere. Meanwhile, the gendarmes are occupied (no doubt to the gratification of the Lurs) in depriving the villagers of Iraq of their arms, their sole defence against brigands from whom the gendarmes are quite unable to protect them. O It is anticipated that in a fortnight’s time or so, when the Bairanwand have migrated southwards, the Persian Government will despatch a force of gendarmes or others to Burnjird, which w r ill be in a position to announce that it has restored order (the disturbers of the peace having left as usual for their winter quarters). My negotiations with the Bala Garimeh during the day centred on the question of hostages. They promised to provide them in Dizful, but not here. I at first stipulated for Nasiri instead of Dizful, hut, finding this impracticable, gave way, but insisted on hostages being provided at Khoremabad, to be retained until we had taken delivery of the hostages at Dizful. The chiefs declined to do this, and every sort of argument w T as brought to bear to induce me to give way. October 17.---It was arranged that the following documents should be drawn up and sealed by the Bala Garimeh chiefs :— 1. A “ qur’an ” to be sealed by the Baharwand, declaring that in so far as the survey party was concerned, they would put tribal quarrels on one side. 2. A “ qur’an ” to be sealed by the Mirs to a similar effect. 3. A “qur’an ” to be sealed by both the Baharwand and Mirs promising to observe the agreement (A) sealed by them, to pro^de hostages at Dizful and to demand nothing additional to what is provided for in the agreement. 4. An agreement to be sealed by both Baharwand and Mirs detailing their obligations and the amounts to be received from us. 5. An agreement to be sealed by the Judeki to the same effect and also a Koran as (3) above. 6. An agreement to be sealed by the Diwanbegi and Beglerbegi, whereby the former accompanies us to Dizful and returns with the survey party with 1G sowars at 5 krans a day with the Beglerbegi’s son, and the Beglerbegi himself to act as our a^ent at Khoremabad. ^ ^ * 7. A written certificate from the Beglerbegi that he is satisfied with the documents (1) to (5) above and makes himself responsible for the signatories. Translations of these documents will follow'. October 18.—Further negotiations with the Bala Garimeh continued during the day; at the last moment they declared themselves unable to leave before the 26th October (instead ot the 21st) and unable to guarantee my arrival at Dizful before the 17th November (instead of the 5th). A deputation of chiefs came to see me in the afternoon to explain their views on this and other matters, and after a protracted wrangle I was unable to get them to do mure than promise (on the “ Qur’an ”) to be at Dizful by the 1 4th November, though I offered them every sort ot inducement, financial and otherwise. Most of the chiefs signed the various oaths on the “Qur’an” and the agreement in the afternoon, but a few who held back will, it is hoped, sign to-morrow. October 19. Practically all the remaining chiefs signed, and I issued 7,000 krans cash as advance payment of subsidy. Husain Khan Muradaliwand gave great trouble, as he did in 1911, by raising every sort of difficulty, dragging in ancient tribal feuds, etc. A. T. WILSON, Captain, I.A , Additional Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, on special duty in Khuzistan. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Captain Wilson to Sir W. Toicnley. . . Khoremabad, October 19, 1913. J . continuation of my despatch dated the 30th September regarding the position o a lairs m Burujird, and in accordance with your Excellency’s instructions, I have thehonour to submit the following report on the present condition of affairs in Luristan province ar referenCe to the mtere sts of the Persian Railway Syndicate in the s „ • tk L T 1 - t r Q ha ® !’ ee , n ia a more or less continuous state of anarchy for many years vaned by brief periods during which order was maintained by energetic Governors 7 but the relics of ancient well-graded caravan tracks, and the reportf of ^riy Welkrs ° f firearmS there “ ^0 from relatively^to'each' other°as S follows^&gt;—■ ma7 ^ t0 ° 0nSist ° f four districts - sltuated [Sketch not reproduced.] hered^ta^rw'd^vhiro P t USl b' i l' K; r h ’ S a . di . strict a P art 1 &gt;* is well-ruled by a st ong S Sfisi**' - «» —W- i a. .li..*. i., t: ;h 1 I ,/!- r-Kn h .—Pish - i-Kuh includes all the west and north-west portions of the prm mce and is the habitat of the Silsileh and Dilfan clans, which are subdivided into a g c t numbei of minor and independent tribes. For the past 10 years the district has een controlled to some extent by Nazar Ali Khan, Sardar Akram, a brigand who has risen to his present position by bis own force of character and Jbility^but remains potentially a brigand still. Like the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh he is on friendly terms with rno l f °v ''T’ an i glVe i n eVe17 facillt y to me ’ this year as in 1911, to travel in his fitly, besides affording other proofs of goodwill. If a strong Governor-General were gn e some practical support to the Sardar Akram, the latter would probably be &lt;dad PisM Kuh F t m ’ aD ? h J tl ? i8 meanS some sort of order could be maintained in w it htl p f-p Lut k oc 1 casiona l cfhcial punitive expeditions would still be necessary to deal ] 1 a t S Wh ° 1V - 7 Kha ^’ ehand Alishtar and raid Nihawand territory/ When the Sardar Akram punishes such tribes he does so willingly enough, but with an eye to his future relations with them, and to the feelings ofhis own tribesnTen andTs unable to mete out that ruthless punishment which alone has any permanent effect • he suppresses them for the time being, that is all. 5 Bala Garimeh -This district, which takes its name from the congeries of tribes that inhabit it, lies athwart the only practicable caravan tracks, cart-roads, or railway a ignments from south to north, and any Governor-General who (like the Ain-mL Dowleh) has attempted to open up the Luristan road has occupied himself mainly with GaHmeh) 1 ^’ ^ Bairanwand ( who are ’ strictly speaking, part of the Bala , . l he Dirakwand and Judeki,have no hicilities for plundering anyone but their fellows and the townspeople of Khoremabad ; their depredations in Arabistan are unimportant, and do not affect the general question of Luristan : they pay no revenue. j r j If and when the Luristan road is to be opened, or a railway built, this district must be seriously taken in hand; if not it is not worth while to do so. It is w ith this group of tribes that I have concluded agreements for the safe conduct of the survey party to Khoremabad. G. Bairanwand. Ibis tribe, with whom for some purposes are allied the Ali Khani Sagwand, have their winter quarters in Pusht-i-Kuh, and spend the summer near JBurujird. By far the greater part of the brigandage that has devastated the settled districts of Iraq and Malayir during the past few years lias been due to them. It ^\as with them that Amil Mufakham had to fight in 1911 before he could reach Khoremabad, and though he had more than 3,000 men with them it was more by good luck than good management that he did not suffer a severe defeat. A strong Governor-General at Burujird with a force of 1,000 men, or even less if undei Luropean leaders, whilst unable to enter the hills of the Bairanwand and punish them as them as they deserve, could nevertheless keep them in check and put a sto &gt; to all raiding northwards or in the neighbourhood of Burujird. It is only because there has been no sort of force at Burujird that the Bairanwand have been able to extend the area of their raids so far northwards. 7. It only remains to consider the town of— Khoremabad. —This^ is governed, in the absence of anyone else, jointly by the heads of the two leading families, known as the Diwanbegi and the Beglerbegi they are on [19G7 p 3] Dvery good terms with British officers, .and are at present in receipt of salaries in connection with the survey party. The town is unimportant commercially, and manages to maintain fairly satisfactory relations with the surrounding tribes : the absence of a Governor-General has no such grave effect on its prosperity os on that of Burujird. 8. The views submitted above may be briefly summarised as follows :— Pusht-i-Kuh. —Will not be affected one way or the other by a Governor-General; status quo satisfactory to us. Pish-i-Kuh. —Governor-General not likely to improve matters ; from our point of view present position not unsatisfactory ; from point of view of Persian Government no worse than for last ten years or so. Bala Garimch. —Not worth while to take district in hand unless it is intended to embark on road or railway construction. Bairanwand. —It is important to restore order; this can be done by a Governor at Burujird with a small force. 9. The logical deduction from the above premises, if they are so fortunate as to meet with your Excellency’s acceptance, would seem to be that the appointment of a Governor for Burujird with a small force (as already suggested) will suffice to dispose for the time being of the Bairawand question. As regards the Bala Garimeh, it will be time enough for us to give active support to a Governor-General when our railway option has been converted into a concession. Order once restored, railway construction would be greatly facilitated, but the process would take some time, six months or more, and, in the meantime, work would be at a standstill. 10. I am hopeful that the agreements I have made with the Bala Garimeh tribes and others will ensure the satisfactory progress of the survey party between now and next March or April, when it should reach Khoremabad, and, until it has been shown that the tribes will not act up to their engagements, or until the survey party has left Luristan, I am inclined to deprecate the despatch of a Governor-General to Luristan, unless it is understood that he will remain at Burujird. Ir, however, a Governor-General is despatched, his first act should be to write to the various tribes and notables with whom 1 have concluded engagements, expressing his approval of the latter, and enjoining all concerned to act in conformity therewith under pain of incurring the wrath of the Persian Government. I attach great impoitance ^to this step, and beg that your Excellency will insist on its observance in event of a Governor-General being appointed ; I have given copies of all our agreements to the Bagierbegi of Khoremabad, a man who has enjoyed the confidence of successive Governors-General and who is now the Khoremabad agent of the Persian Bailway byndicate at a monthly salary of 1,000 krans (and also duputy-governor), and have instructed him to communicate them to the Governor-General on receipt of orders to this effect from me or my successor. 11. I will shortly submit to your Excellency copies of the agreements in question, together with translations, m order that, should it be deemed expedient, they may be communicated to the Persian Government, though, on general grounds, I should be inclined to deprecate any such step as the Persian Government is not unlikely to raise o jec ions o icm on one giound or the another, to the prejudice of the survey party in uiis an, an o le ersian Lailway Syndicate, when the time comes for the recovery of the cost of the survey from the Persian Government.

Whitelaw is fully conversant with, and shares my opinions, which I have expressed in my despatches 1 to 13, and which remain unchanged.

The latest news from the north is to the effect that Bairanwand, on the invitation of Judiki, have taken up a position across our route at Domichul and are waiting to extort money from us; further, that the Sardar Akram has made an arrangement with the Bairanwand for the same purpose. Khoremabad city is disturbed, and Hasanawand have come down to a position where they can intercept us. Sagwand are conspiring against us secretly and the Qalawand have broken their oath openly. The only tribe which has kept faithful is the Bahaawand, and they had to be bribed by a sum nearly equal to half a months pay. I am sure that subsidies will cost 5,000?., and I can put no limit to the possible I cost.

With referenoe to the concluding sentence of para 3 of my letter dated 21st October, regarding the arrange ments made and in contemplation to ensure the safety of the survey party of the Persian Railway syndicate between Dizful and khurramabad, 1 have the honour to address you on the question of the nature of the Survey)^ if any to be made by the Syndicate's engineers between ^hurramabad and Burujird. 2. The position as I understand it in regard to this question is as follows:- hn option for a Mohammerah idiurramabad line has been given to the Syndicate by the Persian government, and a survey of the line is now in progress for and at the ex pense of the Persian Government* tfore the survey being conducted solely for and at the expense of the Persian Railway Syndicate, it might be considered that they were not entitled to push their survey beyond the point to which the option has been granted, and into the Russian sphere, but since this is not the case, it would not appear that the Russian Government would reasonably object to its being pushed as far as Burujird* In any case, owing to the normal absence of telegraphic communication between Burujird and the rest of Persia, it is unlikely that the Russian Government would hear of the survey (through their native Agent at Burujird) until s^me time after its completion/C ■■ oomplation. r9ffl '« b9r ^ that i ,ae prohibits in 1911 r-^rrsis —»*»« i'eteruburgh^ii^info^^uoaiiln* ! no, ' th of ‘ Ului ' - Uovarmaent that Wilson on terrina- l tion of his survey will visit Buru- ! r&gt;AIIiabad al though jird as an ordinary traveller but 2 ■rill of course make no aurvey'in aS a nlatt9r of u ' 1 *' *'“» i «.t fo r „ 5 least 32 miles along the alignment vrhioh fould I believe be approximately t0 til9 Ohafireh Shah Paso, if not Military Report 0 ^ 3 %!! °' 8 J b ° y0nd ' tha lin9 w ^ld lie f 90util ° r Ihe rvucaian sphere. 4. I have little doubt that it will be possible to make suitable arrangements for the safe conduct of the survey party between idiurramabad and burujird. particularly if the former town is reached by the efcd of .arch, and X have already entered into preliminary negotiations on the sub ject with the Chiefs of the principal tribes concerned and received satisfactory assurances. r&gt;.

From September aoth to September 25th. upplied with 10 hdia, Foreign XREiARY'f No 4 9 VI, dated 4 U£G19I3 ■1 September 20th. —After much discussion I managed to hire through the Bank eight mules and one pack horse on an eight months’ contract at the rate of 7^ Krans a day, four months’ hire (8,000 Krans) payable in advance, the balance monthly, after deducting advances made to muleteers on the march. This is a very high rate of hire, but not more exorbitant than at present ruling on roads in Northern Persia : the present rate between Resht and Hamadan, in spite of the wheeled traffic, is about eight Krans a day per mile. We left Hamadan at 2 P.M. accompanied by ten mounted guards obtained after some difficulty from the Acting Governor. Arrangements were made simultaneously for guards from Daulatabad (Malayir) to meet us at Mangawi where we arrived at 7-15 P.M. (13J miles). vide Route 66. The Mangawin pass (7,500' on map) Routes in Persia. Volume II. t j m il es f r0m Hamadan appears to be the accepted boundary between the Hamadan and Malayir districts. September 21st. —Left Mangawi at 7 A.M., dismissing the Hamadan sowars with a gratuity of 10 Krans each and taking on the Malayir sowars. On reaching Zamanabad at 8 A.M. news was received that a raiding party had occupied a pass on the main road to Daulatabad: after 4 or 5 hours’ delay it was decided to go on by a circuitous path, but no sooner had we started, and approached the next village, then a brisk fire was opened on us by the villagers, who mistook us for a raiding party. A further delay of an hour resulted and it was not until 7-15 p.M. that we reached Daulatabad, in heavy rain, and were escorted to the “ Diwankhaneb ” where w r e were to be the guests of the Acting Governor, Mirza Hussain Khan M’awin, whom I at once recognised as the M’awin at Shiraz of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh; he had followed the 39th Central India Horse from Shiraz to Ispahan, and had reason to be grateful for the kindness he had received at their hands on the way, at a time when he was in very low water. He was genuinely pleased to meet me again, and proved pleasant and helpful, though I gather he is not efficient as a Governor. September 23rd. —The following local notables called ;— Abbas Quli Khan, Salar Humayun, (“ Zargham ”) a big landlord, who disposes of some 50 mounted guards Muhammad Baqir Khan, Beglerbegi, a local chief who commands the district levies. u C99FD2 Ali Pasha Khan, Sartip, “ Haji Zadeh ” of Karmanshah, an old adherent of the Salar-ud-Dauleh, who is in command of some guards from Karmanshah. Mirza Ibrahim Khan, Rais*i-Maliyeh, who is shortly to be replaced by A. Sardar, a princeling who was formerly in the same capacity at Shiraz, and left in October 1911 for Japan on tour. The Aciing Governor was loud in his complaints against the Treasury Administration, who, he said, were bringing every sort of pressure to bear on him and on others to force peasants to pay revenue, but refused to provide money to protect the villages from Lur raids : he ascribed to M. Monard’s ineptitude the disastrous and repeated raids of this year, saying that had Monard not refused all assistance to the local authorities, the Lurs could not have carried their raids to such a point. During the afternoon we went to see the “ park ” of Prince Haji Saif-ud- Dauleh : it is the finest garden I have seen in Persia : almost unwalled, very well laid out, well planted and well watered, with a fine back ground of rocky hills. I saw the local Agent of the “ Oriental Carpet Company Limited ” several times: he is a young Swiss by name Hartmann. He talked a good deal regarding the diplomatic protection which his company, he said, claimed from British Consular Officials in Persia, though the Company’s headquarters are in Smyrna and though it was registered as a Turkish Company, he believed, as well as being registered in England. He said he had a British Flag ready to fly if necessary. As regards his personal protection, he said that he had been definitely informed by his principals in Persia (at Hamadan) that, being a Swiss, he could claim only French or German personal protection. I replied that this was not so, the Swiss Govern ment having to the best of my belief, formally given to its subjects in countries where there were no Swiss Consular Officers, the option of choosing the country from whose Consular Officers they might seek protection. This firm is extending its operations so largely in Persia that this matter despatch from Foreign Office to Constan- w T ould appear to be of some importance. , 1 he Company recently absorbed another arge concern, which was definitely under American protection. At dusk Mirza Ali Akbar arrived with 20 sowars from Buruiird via Nihawand : they were under the command of— j jdwau rvnan, son ot A. ^auuiyd, ^naqarwana or rsmurramabad.

So it turned out and after half an hour’s delay and much promiscuous firing and galloping over the plain, we passed three guards and some frightened peasants the sole cause of the panic. On the way we received news that a force of gendarmes had raided Burujird and introduced a fresh element of disturbance into the local situation. A separate report on this subject has been submitted by telegraph. After some difficulty l induced my escort to push on to Burujird forthwith, a total distance from Daulatabad of some 35 miles and 1 arrived at the town at 7-15 P.M. I was met at the outskirts by Hussian Khan of the Guzardi, who have been the sole defenders of the town (for consideration) against the attacks of the Bairanuand and other Lurs. We were provided with excellent accommodation in a largish new house recently built by our Agent, well carpeted and furnished and conveniently situated (in these troublous times) in the heart of the town. September 2^th .—I was occupied all day in receiving deputations of notables and merchants : the arrival of the Gendarmerie, 48 hours in advance of mv own entry into the town, was naturally ascribed to the action of His Majesty’s Legation, to whom a petition had recently been addressed by the inhabitants of the town. I found it difficult to reply to their expressions of gratitude to His Majesty’s Legation for having caused the Gendarmerie to be despatched, coupl ed as these expressions were with enquiries as to why the gendarmes had suddenly left the town, leaving it and its inhabitants in worse plight than before. I was reminded by my interlocutors that it was His Majesty’s Govern ment who was really paying the gendarmerie, and the hope was expressed that they would not be permitted to add to the difficulties of the situation in this un fortunate town by perpetrating such apparently irresponsible raids. At midday firing began on the outskirts of the town, a number of Bairan- wand tribesmen having come to claim the return of those imprisoned by the gendarmerie. Four townspeople were killed during the afternoon, and several wounded, and it was reported that the tribesmen were meditating an attempt to obtain possession of the tw r o Englishmen in the town in order to force the gendarmerie to return the prisoners. A gendarme (a Saiyid) who had been left behind in the town (having over slept himself) took refuge in my house (over which the British Flag was flying) in fear of his life, the townspeople being apparently greatly incensed, their gratifi cation at the gendarmes' arrival and successful sallies having given place to resentment at seeing them fly the town, without regard to the consequence that they would involve to the townspeople. (Sd.) A. T. WILSON, Captain, f.A., Additional Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on special duty in Khusistan. Telegram P., dated 25th September 1913. From—C aptain A T. Wilson, To—Minister (repeated to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf). On the 22nd instant a force of some 250 gendarmes under Skjalddrand arrived without warning. After some skirmishing with tribesmen, in the course of which several were killed and 30 captured, the town was occupied. A sally was also made against some Bairanwand near the town, and several tribes men were killed. The whole force left for Sultanabad (whence they came), unexpectedly before dawn on the 2vth. I had no opportunity of seeing the officer in command of the gendarmerie, as I arrived after dark on the 24th.I 4 It is alleged that the gendarmes had no orders from Tehran to undertake the above action, but whether or not this is the case, a deplorable effect has been created by their precipitate retirement. Having committed the local authorities to a policy of active hostility against powerful tribes they have not left the former ^against the reprisals which the latter are now engaged in preparing. Nothing but harm can come of this raid unless the gendarmes return or are replaced by a force at least as large, and the state of the district will be even worse than it is already. Local opinion ascribes to Your Excellency’s representations regarding the state of the district to the Persian Government responsibility for the despatch hither of the gendarmerie, a petition having been recently addressed to you by the inhabitants of that town : unless they are replaced or sent back the political effect of the incident to us will be very adverse and the gendarmerie’s prestige will be lowered. I trust that Your Excellency will feel able to make representations to the above effect to the Persian Government. I need hardly add, as regards my personnel plans that the action taken as above by the gendarmes is inconvenient in the extreme, and has upset all my dispositions, as the chiefs on w T hom I relied (Bairanwand) have had several of their friends and relations killed or captured. A special messenger will transmit to me any reply sent to Daulatabed to my address. Diary from 25th September to 4th October 1913. September 23th —Spent the greater part of the day receiving and paying calls. The Proceedings at these ceremonies were more like “ fatiha khaneh ” (funeral gathering) than social gatherings. Several people were killed during the day by Lurs on the outskirts of the town ; corpses could not be taken out for burial, and one body w*hich the Lurs secured was found later with the teeth smashed, stripped, and thrown to the dogs, an incident which serves to show how bitter are the feel ings aroused amongst the Lurs by the recent gendarmerie raid. Two villages in the neighbourhood were sacked this day, Bid Kurpi, some 8 miles to the north of Burujird, (in Malayir) by a band of Lurs under Husain Quli Khan, Papi, Sher Muhammad Khan, Ali Khani Sagwand and others, and Daiyichi ; the latter village was destroyed after it had been sacked, the beams of the houses being bound or carried off for sale in the neighbourhood by the Lurs. The smallest show of unity amongst villagers would make this latter step impossible, but unfortunately they are unable to resist the temptation of buying looted goods cheap. Amongst the principal callers were the following:— (1) Haji Farman Farma, Salar Mansur, Shahzadeh and his son, Haji Askar Mirza, aged about 20, speaks a little French. ( 2 ) Jalal-ud-Din Mirza, Telegraph Clerk, Shahzadeh, Wali Muhammad Mirza, Shahzadeh, a relation of ( 1 ). (3) Ghulam Husain Khan, Nusrat-us-Sultan, Gudarzi. (4) Husain Khan Sarhang, Gudarzi. (5) Husain Khan, Salar Nusrat, Wannai, Gudarzi. (6) Mustafa Khan, Gudarzi. (7) Murtaza Khan Wannai, Gudarzi. (8) Yusuf Khan. (9) Mutassir-es-Sultaneh, Deputy Governor. Return calls were paid on (1), (3) and (4). &gt; % &gt;5 The following merchants who were amongst those ^who called, were called upon in return • Haji Asadullah, Ispahan!. • Haji Abbas Ali, Ispahan!. The latter is an intelligent man and might be useful to us later on. Return calls were also paid upon the following local divines:— Haji A. Fakhr^ud-Din, Iftikhar-uMslam, strongjconstitutionalist and large landowner. Haji Muhammad Hussain, Hajjab-us-Islam, a large landowner and his son Mirza Muhammad Taqi, Siqat-ul-Islam. Both today and yesterday there was some firing by night, the gendarmerie raid has undoubtedly increased local insecurity; further attacks by Lurs on villages in the neighbourhood were reported. Letters from Bairanwand chiefs to local notables indicated that they proposed to make use of my proposed trip to Khurramabad vid their country to force the Persian Government to hand back the prisoners captured. It is to be hoped that when the Persian Government take in hand the restoration of order here no mercy will be shown to the Barrawand tribesmen or to their chiefs. The districts of Silakhor Pain and Silakhor Bala, and Burujird, not to mention Nihavand Malayir and ’Iraq have been so h/rried by them that years must elapse before they will recover themselves. The chiefs have grown rich and own land and villages, a circumstance which should assist the Persian Government in its task for the confiscation of these ill-gotten gains would be an easy matter and would produce an immediate effect, though nothing short of the execution of the principal Khans can be considered adequate penalty for the misery they have caused. September 27th .—I concluded an agreement with the British Consular Agent, Mirza Ali Akbar, whom I propose to take down to Dizful, to act as intermediary between the Syndicate’s engineers and Lur Chiefs, and as general fac totum. It was stipulated that he should be paid at the rate of 1,000 Krans (Rs. 270! a month from 1 st October with an allowance of 1,300 Krans a month for all contingent expenses of every kind, his transport and riding animals to be fed by the Syndicate when he is with them; losses by theft or unavoidable mishap to be reimbursed. This seems a high rate of remuneration, but he is a fairly prosperous merchant, who has recently married money, and I know of no one else suitable for the purpose; Mr. Soane’s illness made it essential for the Syndicate to obtain the services of some intermediary and Mirza Ali Akbar is the only person I know with the requisite qualifications. September 28th .—1 had hoped and it had been arranged for me to leave Burujird today, ostensibly for a night or two to visit the village of VVannai, 8 miles north-west of the town, but really en route to Nihavand,_ whence to Harsin, or wherever the Sardar Akram might be in order to obtain an escort from him to take us to Khurramabad, the direct route from Burujird along the projected ' railway alignment being impracticable owing to the vagaries of the gendarmerie j already recorded. But a renewed outburst of Lur raids near the town made it j impossible, Nusrat-us-Sultan, Gudarzi, who had undertaken to escort me to Wannai, being fully occupied elsew T here ; he promised how'ever to ride out with me, without fail, next morning. September 29th .—Left Burujird at about 9 A.M. accompanied by Nusrat-us- Sultan, and Husain Khan Sarhang of the Gudarzi, and others. Reached a willow grove near Kafshigivan, some 7 miles from Burujird, at the foot of the Kuh-i-Garreh, opposite Ushtarinan, at about 11 A.M. and after a long wait had lunch. Several other Gudarzi chiefs joined us from neighbouring villages. After lunch we rode some C99FD6 3 miles in a southerly direction up a gorge to Wannai, a Gudarzi village in a hill- bound valley, watered by a fine stream whose source is some 5 miles distant from the village, and is known as Chashmeh-i-Safid. There is reported to be a fine cave here, which was visited by Nasr*ud-Din Shah. We had no time to visit this spring, but went on for a mile to visit another, known as Chashmeh-i-Gilli, which feeds a different stream, also running towards Burujird. In the gorge through which this latter stream pierces the foot hills is reported to exist a show of petroleum oil. The Gudarzi Khans also mentioned to me a reported deposit of coal at a village within gunshot of Burujird called Fial. I asked Nusrat-us-Sultan to procure a donkey load of the coal in question and send it to the house of our Consular Agent, in readiness for the return of the party of engineers. A sample of lead ore obtained near Burujird is already available in the Residency at Bushire. The Wannai valley would be an excellent place for the incumbent of the Luristan appointment to camp in for a period, when visiting this part of Luristan. The Gudarzi Khans who own it are friendly and useful, and are in relations with all neighbouring tribes, who could be visited, or invited to come in, much more easily than at Burujird. The Gudarzi Khan extended a cordial invitation to me and to all my successors to camp in this valley. On our return from Wannai I was hospitably entertained at Kafshgiran. During the afternoon a timely messenger arrived with replies from Prince Ihtisham-ud-Dauleh, of Nihavand, inviting me to visit him and from the Sardar Akram, enclosing letters to the Bairanwand advising them to behave themselves and give me all facilities adding in his letter to me that if 1 thought them unreliable he would gladly arrange to see me through to Khurramabad or else* where via Khawa and Alishtar. I had already decided on this route, and made these letters my excuse for leaving on the following day for Nihavand, to the surprise of my hosts who, like every one else, though I was going to Khurrama bad with the Bairawand. September 30//*.—Left Kafshigivan at 7 A.M.; halted an hour later at the newly built villages of Haji Bashir-ul-Mamalik, Amir Toman, to have breakfast with him ; he is a nice old gentleman whom I met several times in 1911 and whom I owed a call. We then went on for another hour to the village of Qaid Tahir, where lunch was prepared for us. The Gudarzi Khans here took leave of us, sending however several sowars with us to Nihavand, reached at about 2-30 p.m/ We were met at the outskirts by the usual “ yadak ” (led horse) and mace- bearers, and escorted to the house of Zafar-us-Sultan, where we had tea with the Deputy Governor Haji Samsam-ul-Nizam, an unpleasant creature whom I had met in 1911. Later on I went to call on Prince Ihtisham-ud-Dauleh ; Mirza Ali Akbar had previously been careful to inform him that at Hamadan Malayir and Burujird the Governors and others had always paid the first call on me, but that I had insisted on paying the^ first call on him, in view of his rank and distinguished services. He was most friendly and cordial and was not a little flattered at my detailed references to the historic services rendered to Persia by his father Khamber M irza in the fifties and sixties. He wrote to the Sardar Akram advising him to meet my wishes in every way ; he asked me to send him a copy of Layard’s “ Early Adventures ” in which are numerous references to his father, and I promised to send him one. I have since ordered a copy to be sent to him direct from London, bound in leather. During the afternoon Ismail Khan Zafar-us-Sultan called on me ; he is a young man, of considerable wealth but apparently no force of character. October /sA—The caravan got off soon after 7 A.M.: we waited till 8-30 when Prince Ihtisham-ud-Dauleh paid a return call. He referred to the presence in Nihavand of a certain Count Liedekerk de Beaufort, a traveller and pseudo savant whose connection with the French “ Mission Scientifique en Perse” is not clear 5 it appeared that this gentleman was anxious to visit Luristan for» 7 archaeological purposes.^ I had met him in Ahwaz in April and was not favour ably impressed with him. After some private conversation with me Prince Ihtisham-ud-Daulah informed me that he had decided to tell the Count that before he could permit him to proceed to Luristan, the permission of the Farman ^ Farma and of the Persian Government must be formally sought and obtained. We left Nihavand about 9-30 a.m. accompanied for some distance by 3 of the Prince’s sons, Abbas Mirza Muin-i-Darbar, Ali Naqi Khan and Khamber Mirza ; (the first named a quite hopeless creature), and his nephew Hasan Ali Mirza. Pariswan was reached at about 2 P.M. We were met at about a mile from the village by a number of horsemen sent by Muhammad Sharif Khan Salar Nizam, the owner of the village who welcomed us and put us up in his guest room. I had met him in 1911 when he was acting as Rais-i-Nazmieh, and he was the more cordial in consequence. A Persian Armenian doctor named Mirza Tataus, of Hamadan, who spoke English fairly well, was staying with him. During the evening Mirza Hidayat, the son of the Beglar Begi of Khurramabad, who accompanied me in 1911 on my journey to Tehran and back, came from an adjoining village to see me. News was received during the evening that a caravan had been looted and 2 men killed by the Karm ’Ali tribe on the Warazan pass 3 miles distant. October 2nd .—Left Pariswan at 6-45 A.M., and commenced the ascent of the Khatun Rah pass across the high range which forms the boundary between Luristan and the Persian plateau. We were accompanied by Salar Nizam in person, with some 30 or 40 retainers to the top of the pass (9,600') whence a fine view was obtainable southwards of the broad plains of Chawari and Khaweh. These plains are at present little cultivated, but they are well watered and very fertile and with decent Government could soon be restored to their ancient prosperity, to which numerous mounds scattered over the plain bear witness. Descending steeply some 1,500' we crossed the plain to the village of Hormuz Khan, in Chawari, where a large “ istikbal ” awaited us. It was headed by Mirza Salim, the father of the Sardar Akram’s Mirza and consisted of some 70 well armed and well mounted men, with the usual complimentary led-horses (yadak) and mace-bearers, standard bearer and mounted drum-major, with a pair of drums attached to his saddle peak. The procession having formed up and Mirza Salim having delivered a friendly message of welcome from the Sardar Akram, we marched over undulating country to the Sardar’s camp in the locality called Sanjabi, some 4 miles distant. The Sardar received us in his tent (a large swiss cottage pattern of Indian make) and after apologizing for not having sent his son Ali Muhammad Khan to meet us, owing to his youth and inexpe rience, he introduced me to his progeny :— Ali Muhammad Khan, Shahab-us-Sultaneh, aged about Nusratullah Khan Jushmal Khan Yadullah Khan ... Assadullah Khan Several of the Kakawand elders were also present, notably— ... 13 ... 10 ... 6 ... 4 ... 4 Ibrahim Khan, Afghan-us-Sultaneh, brother of Baqir Khan, Azim-us- Sultaneh ; the former is on bad terms with the latter and is supporting Sardar Akram in his projected attack on the Kakawand. After lunch the Sardar paid a return call on me, only his little sons, and Mirza Ali Akbar being present. We soon got to business., and after a cordial 1 enquiry after the health of Captain Lorimer who, he said, had first showed him the way of prosperity by introducing him to the British Government, and after a friendly reference to His Majesty’s Consul Kirmanshah, he turned to the business of the day by saying that he wished to confirm verballv to me all he had written in 1911 as to his readiness to co-operate with us in the matter of j roads or railways through his territories. A translation of the agreement in [ question is attached herewith for convenience of reference, together with the document renewing and confirming the same.8 As regards railways, he said he quite understood their advantages to him and his people, and also their prospective disadvantages ; which latter he described as increased vulnerability and incieased opportunities for the Persian Government and its local officials to h/rry him and his tribes at pleasure. 1 this, he said was what the newspapers meant when they said that railways always hroupht security, “ he was not taking any ” unless we could assure him that his positfon and rights and those of his people would be respected. I replied that our experience of railways all over the world in the past 50 years or so was that they brought security not by making independent tribes less independent, but by increasing trade, opening new markets, and adding appreciably to the personal prosperity of every individual in their vicinity. 1 said somewhat disingenuously that thieves and robbers m Lunstan were seldom so by choice want and poverty having driven them to it, and when railways opened up markets to all and sundry to dispose of local produce, the resulting prosperity would itself bring security. 1 added that as regards his personal position, he was now the biggest land- owner in Luristan, and as such stood to gain enormously by the development of communications, which alone would make it possible for him to extract profit from the vast fertile areas now given up to pasture or totally deserted. For good or evil he and his people were the inhabitants of the land, and could not be ejected by any Government ; any change of habit or custom would come slowly and benefit all alike. Some further discussion on the subject followed, and on my pointing out that he was looking rather far ahead, there being at the moment no question of actual railway construction, he asked me to give him an undertaking that con struction would not begin in his territories without his consent. I assented to | this and a copy of my note to him to this effect is attached. October 3rd .—Halted at Sanjabi and had a further discussion with the Sardar Akram. He was still apprehensive of the effect of the railway on his own position and that of his tribes. He made constant references to Shaikh Khazal \ 0 { Mohammerah who is to the Sardar Akram, as he is to so many other chiefs and notables I have met, the exemplar of a man who has assisted the British and in turn been assisted by them. Finally, I told him the gist of the Shaikh’s undertaking with regard to land required for railway purposes ; this seemed to relieve his mind, and he said he would follow the example thus set. He still pressed for assurances against possible oppression by the Persian Government, but 1 declined to discuss this on the ground that references to this question would at the present juncture be premature. After further discussion he undertook to sign the detailed agreement regard ing guards, etc., for the Survey party and for ourselves, for such portion of the route to be surveyed as lies within his territory (i&gt;., nearly half of the total distance between Dizful and Khurramabad). A translation of this agreement is attached. After further discussion it was agreed that as additional consideration he should receive from me the following presents :— 1 sporting rifle and cartridges—handed to him on the spot. 1 pair Ross binoculars—handed to him on the spot. 1 large three pole two fly tent—to be ordered for him from India (cost debitable to the Persian Railway Syndicate). October 4th .—The Sardar Akram sealed the agreements in the morning, and sent letters to various people counselling them to fall in with my wishes. He also sent me a presentation horse, a nice young colt. I sent him a message saying that Captain Lorimer in 1904 and I myself in 1911 had refused to accept anything from him, as our friendship had not reached such a point as to make it suitable to do so ; having regard however to changed circumstances, I was will ing to accept it on this occasion.Some further discussion took place regarding British claims against the Kakawand the upshot of which will be seen from the attached telegram. I tried hard to get away during the afternoon, but was unable to induce the Sardar to collect the sowars ; he promised however to arrange for an early start next morning. (Sd.) A. T.

Please refer to your telegram of September 26th which reached me on the 29th. Instructions were sent to the Governor Malayir by the Farman Farma on the 22nd instant directing him to make all arrangements for my journey. It was, no doubt, after he had learnt of my safe arrival at Burujird that he sent his subsequent telegram on the subject to Tehran, and it is no doubt connected with his ambition to be made Governor-General of Luristan and may with safety be neglected. At present he has no concern with Luristan. Arrangements have been concluded with the Sardar Akram for my safe conduct {via Nihavand) to Khurramabad and on the 30th I shall reach his camp. At Khurramabad my arrival is awaited by all the requisite chiefs and not ables and very satisfactory assurances have already been received from all con cerned. With the exception of Burujird, which is susceptible of separate treatment, the present state of affairs in Luristan is much more satisfactory than it is likely to be if a Governor-General such as the Farman Farma, or anyone else, were appointed, and I venture to hope that any such nomination will be opposed by Your Excellency as a futile waste of money. Local opinion is unanimous to the effect that beyond amassing w r ealth as at present at the expense of the Persian Government, the Farman Farma will do nothing. Annex I.

From— Captain A. T. Wilson, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran (repeated to Bushire and Kirmanshah). Persistent assertions are current on all sides that the Persian Government have repeatedly asked the Farman Farma to take over the Governorship of Luris tan, and there can be no doubt that active correspondence on the subject is pro- ceedino; between him and the Persian Government. The Farman Farma is not on good terms with the Sardar Akram. from whom I have obtained a very satisfactory undertaking regarding the safe conduct of the Survey Party, nor with the notables of Luristan on whom 1 rely, and for this reason 1 fear that his appointment as Governor-General may operate to the prejudice of the Survey Party. This question apart, the omens seem favourable to the survey progressing smoothly. 10 Krans a day (30 Tomans per mensem), the Sowars 5 „ „ (15 „ .» ), the footman 3 (9 )» » . )&gt; in cash • of 1911. they are employed in places distant from those contemplated by the original agree ment.

He has undertaken to recover British claims of 1909-10 against the Kaka wand, amounting to Tomans 2,761, 400 Tomans of which are claims of American Missionaries. I understand that the above are Kirmanshah claims which have been trans ferred to Ahwaz. I would suggest that the Persian Government be asked to give the necessary instructions to the Farman Farma to issue orders accordingly to the Sardar Akram.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 342 of the 28th ultimo, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a diary which I have received from Captain Wilson giving an account of his movements between the dates of the 20th September and the 24th September last. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Diary from September 20 to September 24 (inclusive). September 20.—After much discussion I managed to hire through the bank eight mules and one pack-horse on an eight months’ contract at the rate of krans a-day, four months’ hire (8,000 krans) payable in advance, the balance monthly, after deducting advances made to muleteers on the march. This is a very high rate of hire, but not higher than that at present ruling on roads in Northern Persia. The present rate between Resht and Hamadan, in spite of the competition of wheeled traffic, is 8 krans a-day per mile. We left Hamadan at 2 p.m. accompanied by ten mounted guards, obtained, after some difficulty, from the Acting Governor. Arrangements were made simultaneously for guards from Daulatabad (Malayir) to meet us at Mangawi, where we arrived at 7*15 p.m. (13|- miles). The Mangawi Pass (7,500 feet on map), 11J miles from Hamadan, appears to be the accepted boundary between the Hamadan and Malayir districts.^ September 21.—Left Mangawi at 7 a.m., dismissing the Hamadan sowars with a gratuity of 10 krans each and taking on the Malayir sowars. On reaching Zamanabad at 8 a.m. , news was received that a raiding party had occupied a pass on the main road to Daulatabad. After four or five hours’ delay it was decided to go on by a circuitous path, but no sooner had we started and approached the next village than a brisk fire was opened on us by the villagers, who mistook us for a raiding party. A further delay of an hour resulted, and it was not till 7*15 p.m. that we reached Daulatabad, in heavy rain, and were escorted to the “ diwankbaneh,” where we were to be the guests of the Acting Governor, Mirza Husain Khan Ma’awin, whom I at once recognised as the Ma’awin at Shiraz of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh. He had followed the 39th C.I.H. to Ispahan, and had reason to be grateful for the kindness he had received at their hands on the way, at a time when he was in very low water. He was genuinely pleased to meet me again, and proved pleasant and helpful, though I gather he is not efficient as a Governor. September 22.—The following local notables called on us :— 1. Ali Pasha Khan, Sartip, Haji Zadeh, of Kermanshah, a Kalhor chief who commands some guards from Kermanshah. 2. Muhammad Bakir Khan, Beglerbegi, a local chief who commands some local levies. 3. Abbas Kuli Khan Salar Humayan (“ Zargham ”), a large landowner, who disposes of some fifty mounted guards. 4. Mirza Ibrahim Khan, Rais-i-Maliyeh, who is shortly to be replaced by A. Sardar, a princeling who was formerly in Shiraz in the same capacity and left in 1911 for Japan. 5. Mirza Ahmad Khan, telegraph clerk. The Acting Governor was loud in his complaints against the Treasury Adminis tration, who, he said, were bringing every sort of pressure to bear on him and on others [1898 u—13] Vide Route 66, “ Routes iu Persia,” vol. ii. )V Copy t i2 to force raiyats to pay maliyat, but refused money to protect the villages from L . raids ; he ascribed to M. Mornard’s ineptitude the disastrous and repeated raids of t}/ 1 * year, saying that had he not refused all assistance to the local authorities in the fi ^ instance the Lurs would never have carried their raids to the present point. ^ During the afternoon he went to visit the “ park ” of Prince Haji Saif-ed Dowl h It is the finest garden I have ever seen in Persia : almost unwalJed, very well laid oV^ well planted and watered, with a fine background of steep rocky hills. I saw the local agent of the Oriental Carpet Company (Limited) several times • h is a young Swiss, by name Hartmann. He talked a good deal regarding the diplomatic protection which his company, he said, claimed from British consular officers in Persia though the company’s headquarters are in Smyrna and though it was recfistered as a Turkish company, he believed. He said he had a British flag ready to fly, if necessary. As regards his personal protection, he said that he had been definitely informed that he could claim only French or German protection, being a Swiss. I replied that this was not so, the Swiss Govern ment having, to the best of my belief, formally given to its subjects, in countries where there were no Swiss consular officers, the option of choosing the country under w hos e. consular officers they might seek protection. This firm is extending its operations so largely in Persia that this matter would appear to be of some importance * t dusk Mirza Ali Akbar arrived with twenty sowars from Burujird via Nihavand • they were under the command of— ’ 1. Jawad Khan, son of A. Rabbiya, of Khoremabad. 2. Rahmatullah Khan, brother of A. Rabbiya, of Khoremabad 3. Murteza Khan, “ Wannai,” Gudarzi. 4. Mustafa Khan, Gudarzi, a relation of Nusrat-us-Sultan Gudarzi. He reported that he had a good deal of trouble with the sowars, who were restive and disobedient. September 23.-I was obliged to remain for another day at Daulatabad as the sowai s horses were tired and the sowars themselves wished to see the sights of the town I was visited by various notables, including Mirza Reza Khan, Messrs.

Laptain Wilson was at Burujird just at a moment when all was in confusion in consequence of the sudden apparition and departure of the gendarmes, and when the inhabitants naturally thought more of possible reprisals on the part of the Lurs than they did of the salutary eflect that the blow dealt to these cut-throats and robbers might have. The lesson administered was a severe one, and I have heard no more rumours of reprisals such as Captain Wilson appeared to fear. Bersian Government is now busily engaged in seeking a suitable man as bovernor-General of Luristan. Ain-ed-Dowleh is especially anxious to appoint someone who will be able to improve the situation, and for that purpose has ottered the post to Nizam-es-Sultaneh, whose return to Persia has been strongly advocated by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on account of his close relations with the oheikh of Mohammerah, the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, and other local chieftains.

Cox to Sir W. Townley. (•Telegraphic.) P. THE surveying party sent out by the railway syndicate, having finished their examination of possible alignments between Dizful and Mohammerah and Khor Musa have now returned to Europe to report and to make preparations for another expedition m the autumn to survey the Dizful-Khoremabad section. I understand that when they get home the question of alignment between Mohammerah and Dizful and possible connections with Khor Musa will be considered, and I have recently received n vf r f r T ® reenwa y ask, ng for an expression of my views on the question as to which bank should be adopted. 4 I have not felt myself m a position to answer his enquiries without reference to higher authority. Lp till now a line on the west of the Karun, either drawn straight from Mohammerah to Dizful or calling at Aminiyeh, has, in the light of such maps and information as have been available, seemed clearly indicated as much cheaper in construction and commercially not less attractive than any other possible alternative by which the construction of several bridges would be involved (please refer to foreign Office enclosure to me, No. 2642, to India, and No. 68/2683 to His Maiestv’s Legation, October, 1910). I am, however, surprised to learn from a recent private discussion of the question with the chief engineer of the surveying party that, in his opimon there is little to choose financially between any of the alternatives on either bank. I he syndicate will, therefore, doubtless be inclined to decide the question according to advice of His Majesty’s Government, as they will presumably have no preference themselves for any particular alignment. From the point of view of present political interests alone it would seem to me that, in the sheikh’s interests and our own, the best alignment would be the west bank route touching at Aminiyeh, leaving the town of Shuster to connect with the railway by water at Aminiyeh, and leaving Khor Musa to be connected up later, if necessary, by a bridge at Marid or oahmanshir junction over the Karun. In this selection, however, no account is taken of strategical aspect of the question. \Ye should be able to control with a greater measure of security an alignment crossing to the east bank at Marid, and thus not depending for the connection with Khor Musa on a destructible bridge, than an alignment on the west bank. But the question of whether future agression is likely to come from the east or the west must also to some extent be taken into account. In any case, it will be presumably worth while taking the line via Bandikir and Shuster d the railway goes by the east bank by Marid onward. I would respectfully urge that your Excellency and the Government of India communicate your views as soon as possible to His Majesty’s Government, and, should jou see no objection, 1 will inform Mr. Greenway that 1 have submitted my ideas to higher authority.

WITH reference to previous correspondence, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to express to you his great regret that, in the following circumstances, it will not be possible for Captain Wilson to undertake his proposed duties in connection with the survey of the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railway. I am to state, for your strictly confidential information, that arrangements have now been made for the definite demarcation of the Turco-Persian frontier by a commission consisting of British, Russian, Turkish, and Persian delegates. Apart from the urgent international considerations of this question, it is a matter of great importance to British interests (which it is unnecessary for me to specify more particularly) that the work of this commission should not be carried out without the presence of a British officer who is intimately acquainted with those interests and with local conditions, and Sir E. Grey is of opinion that Captain Wilson possesses the necessary qualifications in a marked degree, and, in fact, that his presence on the commission is indispensable for the adequate protection of those interests. He is, however, making arrangements for Captain Wilson to spend some weeks in Tehran in the latter half of September, and he will there be able, by telegraphic and telephonic communication, and by addressing communications to various chiefs and notables of Luristan, to do a great deal to facilitate the journey of the surveyors Avorking for the Persian Railways Syndicate. Sir E. Grey understands that Mr. Soane will accompany the surveyors, and he feels confident that that gentleman will, with the assistance of Captain Wilson, be able to make adequate arrangements for their safe conduct. The officer whom the Government of India will depute to take Captain Wilson’s place at Dizful will apparently be unable to proceed to his post in time to accompany the survey party, though on this point Sir E. Grey is still in communication with the Secretary of State for India. Captain Wilson suggests that he should be instructed to be at Mohammerah by the 15th October in order to take over from him there. I am, &amp;c. W. LANGLEY.

We are extremely disappointed at this change as under the terms of the option obtained from the Persian Government it is absolutely necessary that the survey should be completed within the above time. It has been arranged that the various Members of the Survey Party should meet at various points of the route at the end of next month in order that no time may be lost, and as it is very inadvisable for them to travel through Luristan unless accompanied by a Political Officer possessing a good Knowledge of the language and of the tribes we shall be glad to Know what steps His Majesty's Government intend taKing to fill up the vacancy Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. causedcaused by Captain Wilson's withdrawal.

' J Mr. MacLean concurs with Sir Percy Cox that it will be more than probable that i when construction work on the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railway commences, the syndicate will have to make some arrangement with the Persian Government for facilities for navigation on the Upper Karum and Diz, but he is not personally in \ possession of the views of the syndicate, if they have yet formed any, upon this I question. 4 Sir Percy Cox’s suggestion came too late for it to have been possible to have / moved the Persian (government to have made a declaration respecting the opening of the Lpper Karim to navigation at the time when the railway option was granted. If the moment is considered a suitable one, some such arrangement as that suggested by Sir Percy Cox can well be come to by the Persian Government when the final conditions under which the railway is to be constructed are concluded. I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by raising this question at the present time, because 1 am sure that we should receive an answer that the Cabinet are not prepared to take such a step until they can submit their action to the sanction of a Mejliss, because they have already taken upon themselves grave respon sibilities for which they will have to account when the National Assembly next meets.

This I have attributed to a hint from some Russian source, possibly through the Persian Minister in London. I had hoped to get concession signed before the departure of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but failed to do so for some occult reason due to a foreign influence, 1 think. Promises are plentiful that the matter will be settled next week, but a fresh week finds only small progress made. It seems hard on the syndicate to be blocked by Russian influence now when the Russian Government have all along been fully cognisant of all that is being done and concessions have been made to please them. From what the Russian Chargd d’Affaires said to me a few days ago it would appear that some Russian subject or protected person claims certain mining rights in the district. He did not know whether these rights are old or recently acquired.CONFIDENTIAL. Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley (Tehran). (No. 261.)

I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge receipt’d your letter of the 29th ultimo., relative to the mining concession which your syndicate desire to obtain in the district of Kerman in Persia. I am to inform_ you in reply that on the 25th ultimo, Sir E. Grey addressed a telegram to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in connection with your letter of the 22nd ultimo, stating that, while he did not consider that the Persian Government could justly be accused of bad faith in their treatment of this question, he agreed with you that the draft discussed by them with Mr. Preece, with the modifications subsequently introduced into it offered a better basis for negotiation than their own counterdraft, which was open to many technical and practical objections. Sir W. Townley was informed that Sir E. Grey had obtained from you an exact statement of the syndicate’s objections to the Persian Government’s counterdraft, and of the arguments in support of the syndicate’s contention, and that these papers would he sent to him as soon as possible. He was authorised, on their receipt, to bring the objections to the notice of the Persian Government, and to endeavour in a friendly way to overcome their opposition by the use of the arguments supplied by you, and he was instructed, in the meanwhile, to consult Mr. Maclean.

Mr. Maclean indicates that if Sir Walter Town!ey can intimate to the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government desire that the former should be accepted as the basis for further negotiations, he is of opinion that all difficulties will be removed and the concession be promptly concluded, and I shall be much obliged if His Majesty’s Government can see their way to instructing Sir Walter Townley accordingly. 1 am, Ac.

J The arguments in support of our claim which we M ould desire to brinn forward in addition to those indicated m my letter of the 12th ultimo are as follows •— 1. When making the stipulation referred to above, as indicated in my letter of the 14th July to you, and in my telegram of the same date to Mr. Wood, the “mining concession then referred to was, of course, the one negotiated by Mr. Preece subject to certain modifications suggested by Mr. Parker, the complete text of which is contained in the latter gentlemans confidential memorandum of the 3rd February, and not concession on totally new and quite impracticable terms such as are contained in the draft of the southern mining concession subsequently submitted by the Persian Government. J We are quite agreeable to accept any reasonable modifications of the former, and have already indicated to Mr. Wood certain modifications suggested by the Persian Government’s draft to which we are willing to accede. I enclose an amended copy of the concession negotiated by Mr. Preece showino - these modifications, and beg to suggest that this should be used as the basis for any further negotiations, in accordance with the instructions which were given by us to Mr. Maclean before his departure. 2. Our objection to using the Persian Government’s draft as a basis is that it contains so many impracticable conditions and restrictions, and is altogether so badly drafted and so likely to give rise to misunderstandings and trouble hereafter, that it would be very difficult indeed to put it into a reasonable and workable form. The most important of the objectionable conditions are the following :— Article 1. (a.) —Excludes the right to work lime, limestone, gypsum, building stones, and sand. All of these minerals would be necessary for carrying out the concession, either for fluxes or for building operations. (b.) All mines which are at present under regular and legal exploitation or which shall have been conceded prior to the date of the’present contract are excluded. Ihis condition might exclude the exploitation of every known mineral deposit in the area of the concession, and render it absolutely nugatory. (c.) The eoncessionnaire is required to repair all damage done to the surface of all soil belonging to private persons, or on cultivated, afforested, or constructed land belonging to the State. I his is an impracticable condition, and should of course only apply to roads and other made lands. Article 2. —Restricts each working area to 100 hectares, and stipulates that each working area shall be distant not less than 12 kilometres from any other. Both of these conditions are quite impracticable, and we cannot agree to any mutations of this description. Articled, (a.)—Only gives the concessionnaire the right to construct works, &amp;c., Within the area of the concession. : : '' - A y ' [2874 z—i] , 'o It will be necessary to erect smelting works in^ the locality where the ore, fluxes, and fuel can be most economically laid down, and this might he on the coast which is outside the area of the concession. ^ j , ( c \ Only provides for the transhipment of mining products. Provision also is necessary for transhipment of plant, stores, fuel, mixes, and other material necessary for working the concession. Article 6—Provides that payment must be made for lands haoitually destined foi ag we have f ounc i f rom our experiences in the Bakhtiari country, might be held to include rocky hillsides where only one blade of grass can he found in R ^Artwle 9.—Provides that all constructions shall be determined by mutual agreement between the engineer of the Persian Government and ourselves, and that the Persian Government shall have the right of pronouncing as to the necessity or otherwise of any constructions or installations. _ This condition cannot be agreed to by us, as the Persian Government would be quite incompetent to decide what works might or might not he necessary. Article 10.—The conditions of this article in regard to the formation of companies and exploitation of mines are not in accordance with articles 1 and 2. The stipulation that the exploitation of at least five mines shall be commenced within ten years would be an impracticable one should that number of remuneratively workino- mines not exist or have been discovered within that time. The stipulation as to the deposit of 30,0001, and forfeiture of 7,5001 in the event of a companv not having been constructed within eighteen months is a new one, and cannot be agreed to by us so far as regards the amount of the deposit. We have, however, offered, and understand that the Persian Government are agreeable to this, to make’a forfeitable deposit of 7,5001, which condition we have added to Mr. Preece’s terms. Article 11.—Provides that the Persian Government shall be allotted 10 per cent, of the shares in all companies that may be formed to work the concession. This condition would be impracticable. The intention of the Persian Government would be met by allotting to them 10 per cent, of the shares in the original, or parent company, and this we are willing to do if the royalty, as provided for under article 12, is limited to 6 per cent. From the above enumeration of some of the important points of difference between the terms originally arranged by Mr. Preece and the draft submitted by the Persian Government, it will be seen that it would be extremely difficult to bring the two into harmony. But we have instructed Mr. Maclean that, if he cannot induce the Persian Government to adopt the former as the basis for his negotiations, he may accept the Persian Government’s draft as the form on which the concession is to be completed, provided he can arrange all the necessary modifications.

On March 24th Wilson leaves Bushire for Ahwaz, and all necessary arrange ments for the survey party will be made by him. As far as Dizful he anticipates no serious difficulty in arranging for their safety. As regards arrangements for work beyond that place, Wilson anticipates no insuperable difficulty in arranging matters satisfactorily with the tribes, but he expresses the conviction (with which I concur) that direct arrangement with the tribes concerned with a view to securing their consent and co-operation affords the best chance of securing the safety of the parties. Any attempt to impose a survey party on the tribes by force, Persian or otherwise, will be fraught with considerable danger and will in all probability be unsuccessful. He trusts therefore that in the interests of the survey party he will be instructed himself to make the necessary arrangements with the tribes and that no attempt will be made by the survey party of the Syndicate to deal with them or other local authorities through the intermediation of the Persian Government or of its local official representatives.

April 10, 1913. I AM m receipt of your letter of the 7th instant conveying the substance of a further telegram which has been received from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, on the subject of the survey party which has recently been despatched to Mohammerah, and asking for any comments which I may have to offer on this message. Before commenting m detail upon the points raised by the Persian Government I would like to state that we have been guilty of no discourtesy at all, and to point out that the objections raised by them are frivolous in the extreme, and are apparently only put forward with the object of throwing impediments in the way of the carrying out of the survey, instead of assisting it to be carried out as expeditiously and as inexpensively as possible. In the letter of option dated the 9th February, and finally agreed and accepted on the 4th March it was stated that— “ The Persian Government agree to commence this survey now in co-operation with the syndicate ; ” and to comply with this stipulation we made immediate arrangements to send off a survey party to conduct the reconnaissance necessary to enable us to decide upon the most suitable alignment, in readiness for the operations of the party who are to conduct the preliminary survey, which, as the Persian Government point out, can only be conducted in the cold weather. It was necessary, as pointed out in my letter of the 19th ultimo, that this party should be dispatched without the loss of a single day, as even with this it will be difficult to complete the preliminary survey within the period of the option, and, inasmuch as the option letter stated definitely that the survey was to commence now, it did not, nor does it now, appear to us that there was any obligation to refer to the Persian Government on the matter, other than to advise them of the date when our party was leaving in order that they might arrange to send their engineers to meet them. To have sent out party, or any portion of them, via Tehran, would have been not only an unnecessary expense, but also have rendered the completion of the preliminary survey within the option period an impossibility. The inconsistency of the Persian Government’s attitude is evident from the fact that on the 13th March Mr. Wood wired as follows:— “ Persian Government desire to know when will your surveyors arrive to join theirs, who are ready ? ” To which we replied on the 15th idem :— “ Four engineers arriving Mohammerah 10th April, to undertake leeonnaissance survey in order to select route for main survey party, who will probably commence vork end of September.” Whereas they have now informed Sir Walter Townley that they have no engineers whom they can send to Mohammerah. If they have no engineers now ready to send to Mohammerah, the statement made to Mr. Wood on the 13th March was maccura e, an it is obvious that they are not in a position to carry out the condition of the option letter quoted above. ^ , -ui v The misunderstanding on the part of the Persian Government may possibly be partly due to their inexperience in railway matters, and to their no un ers an mg nature of a “preliminary survey.” This, in ordinary railway pai ance, means a suivey for the purpose of obtaining an approximate estimate of the cost of constraction for which it is necessary to take cross sections; study the surface conditions na u material available for construction ; water supplies; transport con i ions , n &amp; in g, [2874 /—5]2 and before this can be undertaken a reconna.ssance survey is necessary in order to decide upon the most practicable and economical route of alignment. From the telegrams received from Mr. Wood, it would appear that the Persian Government have lomething else than the preliminary survey agreed upon in their nbnds, for, on the 19th ultimo, he wired that the Persian Government- “ Honed that surveyors will arrive here in order to consult them and their representatives before embarking on survey, which is intended to be cursory and inexpensive.” And, again, on the 2nd instant, he wired— “Persian Government hope that two out of your four engineers will come to Tehran by tfe 15th May, and perhaps they will be able to supply sufhcient data to satisfy Persian Government’s requirements without further research. But the procedure thus suggested would not be in accordance with the terms of the revised option letter which states that— “ A preliminary survey is necessary. And stipulates that— “ The result of the survey with necessary data must be submitted to the Persian Government six months before the end of that period. And this stipulation is consistent with the Persian Government’s previous attitude when, as it will be remembered, they gave as their reason for not being able to decide whether to complete the contract already before them, or to grant a concession, that they must first of all be provided with an estimate of the cost of the proposed radway.^ ^ ^ ob j ect 0 f tbe preliminary survey is to procure for them (and us) this information, and this object cannot be achieved by a “ cursory survey,” nor by any “ data ” which our engineers could give them in Tehran without going over the route and estimating the amount of work required. With regard to the Persian Government’s complaint that they do not know whether or not the reconnaissance is intended to be the preliminary survey which they under took to carry out in co-operation with the syndicate, this point was quite clearly shown in our telegram of the 25th March to Mr. Wood, which read as follows : “It is necessary to commence reconnaissance immediately if we are to complete preliminary survey by the end of next cold weather. Tjnless preliminary survey then completed, we cannot submit result to Persian Government six months before expny option. Therefore, to comply with Persian Government’s letter they must send their surveyors at once to Moharnmerah to co-opernte with ours. As to the question of the approximate cost of the reconnaissance, we are unable as yet to give any definite figures; but, of course, the expenses will be kept down as low as possible, as, in the event of the Persian Government deciding to grant a concession, instead of entering into a contract, the cost is payable by ourselves. For convenience of reference, I beg to attach a complete docket of all the recen telegrams which have passed between ourselves and our representatives in Tehran in this connection. I am, &amp;c. C.

Our four engineers now en route Mohammerah, and commencing route 10th April, they cannot spare time go Tehran, Persian Government must send their surveyor Mohammerah at once.

I 1 oveign Office to Mr. (Jreenway, Sir ’ WITH reference to your letter of the nth ultimo/onX n^ect^f'the’ Keman mining concession, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to inform you that the information in the possession of this Office does not lead him to the conclusion that the Persian Government can justly be accused of having acted in bad faith in their treatment of this question. Apart from the facts that the terms of the concession were never actually agreed to, and that no answer was returned to letter addressed by Mr. Preece to the Persian Minister of Finance on the 13th October, 1910, there is good reason to believe that opposition to the transaction existed even in the earlier Cabinet with which, through \ ekil-el-Roaza, most of the negotiations were carried on. In these circumstances Sir E. Grey regrets that he cannot see his way to take action of so drastic a nature as that which you indicate. He is, however, disposed to send to your syndicate all the support which he properly can, and I am accordingly to inform you that if you will state exactly the points in the Persian counter-draft which are objectionable, and the reason of the objections, he will instruct His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to bring them to the notice of the Persian Government, and to endeavour to overcome their opposition to your proposals, using in support of your case the arguments contained in your letter under reply, and any others which you mav be able to supply. I am further to suggest that you should indicate the extent to which your syndicate would be prepared in the last resort to modify their original proposals with a view to arrive at a compromise should this prove inevitable.

Grey’s consideration. g The Board are not aware if the statements contained in Mr. Greenway’s letter of the 11th March correctly represent the facts as to the negotiations with the Persian Government in 1910, but, assuming them to do so, they are disposed to think that every effoit should bo made to obtain from that Government an adequate explanation of theii change of attitude, and, if it is not forthcoming, to secure the grant of the concession on the original terms. Should such a course be deemed inexpedient or impracticable, the only alternative would appear to be to advise Mr. Greenway to accept, as a basis for negotiation, the counter-draft now put forward by the Persian Government. Whilst the counter-draft as it stands is, in the opinion of the Board, open to serious objection in some important respects, particularly the limitation of the privilege de recherche to twenty years and the financial provisions contained in articles 11 and 12, it is possible that it might be so amended, as a result of discussion with the Persian Government, as to form an acceptable compromise. In the event of an intimation to this effect being conveyed to Mr. Green way, I am to suggest that he might be invited to furnish detailed observations upon the counter-draft, and to indicate the extent to which his syndicate would be prepared to modify their original proposals.

In view of the numerous verbal discussions and the proposal which you, as representative of the Persian Railways Syndicate, have made to the Persian Government, I have the honour to inform you that the Persian Government grants the right of option to the above syndicate for the construction of a railway from Mohammerah, or some spot adjacent thereto, to Khoremabad, that is to say, either the above-mentioned syndicate shall build the railway in question by means of a loan, on conditions to be arranged hereafter by mutual consent, as a State railway at the expense of the Persian Government, or the Persian Government, on conditions to be arranged hereafter by mutual consent, shall grant the syndicate a concession for the construction of the above-mentioned railway. Since, in order to arrive at a decision in the matter, and for the drawing up of the necessary conditions, preliminary study and survey are necessary, the Persian Government agrees to begin the above-mentioned study and survey from now in co-operation with the syndicate and at the expense of the Persian Government, on the condition that, if on the completion of the survey and study the Persian Government should decide to grant a concession for the construction of the railway by the syndicate, the syndicate refund to the Persian Government the expenses which that Government has incurred for the study and survey. Obviously the Persian Government will provide at its own expense the means for protecting the engineers and surveyors. The period of this right of option is from this date until the lapse of two years, within which period the Persian Government shall communicate its decision to the syndicate; but the result ofthe survey with the necessary information must be submitted to the Persian Government mx months before the end of that period. Should events of force majeure hinder the operations of the surveyors, the period of the right of option and the period fixed for presenting the result of the survey will be prolonged for a period equal to that during which the above-mentioned operations have been delayed.” I have, &amp;c.

WITH reference to the letter from this Office of the 28th ultimo, relative to the proposed survey of the alignment of the Mohammerah-Khoremahad Railway, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to inform you that he has received a further telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran reporting that the Persian Government, in reply to the communication made to them by Mr. Wood, made a formal protest against the dispatch of the party without reference to Tehran, and refused to recognise if or be responsible for its safety. Sir W. Townley induced the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to substitute for this reply a more conciliatory one, accepting the surveyors as making a reconnaissance, and expressing the hope that one or two of the engineers employed could visit Tehran in May with a view to see whether arrangements can be made without further survey. To this suggestion Mr. Wood has replied that the engineers will not be able to spare time to come to Tehran, and has asked the Persian Government to send an engineer to Mohammerah at once. The Persian Government contend that under the option letter they only agreed to meet expenses of a preliminary survey, and that if they are expected to pay for work to be undertaken by the syndicate’s engineers it would have been more courteous on the part of the syndicate to enter into communication with the Government before sending the surveyors to Mohammerah. The Persian Government complain that they are in complete ignorance of the approximate cost of the proposed reconnaissance, and do not even know whether it is intended to be the preliminary survey which they undertook to carry out in co-operation with the syndicate. , , r T v They state that they have no engineer whom they can send to Mohammerah immediately, and assert that, owing to the heat, surveying operations in the south will be impossible until September or later. c .

Sir, Foreign Office., March 28, 191 WITH reference to your letter of the 18th instant relative to the proposed survey of the alignment of the Mohammera-Khoremabad Railway, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edwnrd Grey to inform you that, according to a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, repeating a message from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire, Captain Wilson was instructed to leave the latter place lor Ahwaz on the 24th instant to make all necessary arrangements for the survey party. Captain Wilson anticipated no serious difficulty in arranging for their safety as far as Dizful, and no insurmountable obstacles to accomplishing the same result beyond that place by agreement with the tribes concerned, but he expresses the conviction, in which Sir P. Cox concurs, that the best way of attaining the object in view is to reach a direct agreement with the tribes and secure their consent and co-operation. Captain Wilson is of opinion that any attempt to impose the survey party on the tribes by force, exercised either by the Persian authorities or otherwise will in all probability be unsuccessful, and will in any case be fraught with considerable danger. Captain Wilson, therefore, expresses the hope that neither the syndicate nor the survey party themselves will make any attempt to deal with the tribes or other local authorities either through the Persian Government or through their official agents, and suggests that, in the interests of the party, he should himself be instructed to make the necessary arrangements with the tribes. Sir W. Townley supports Captain Wilson’s opinion, in which Sir E. Grey concurs, and I am to state that directions have been given by telegraph for the issuejto Captain Wilson of instructions in the sense proposed by him. 1 am to ask that orders in conformity with the arrangement contemplated may also be given to the survey party.

Persian Government option letter states Persian Government agree commence survey now. it is necessary commence reconnaissance immediately if we are to complete preliminary survey by end of next cold weather, and unless preliminary survey then completed we cannot submit result to Persian Govern ment six months before expiry option. Therefore, to comply with Persian Government letter, they must send their surveyor at once Mohammerah co-operate with ours.” The suggestion that our reconnaissance party should go to Tehran is a quite impracticable one if the survey is to be completed within the period of the option, as it would mean at least oue to two months’ delay, and prevent the reconnaissance, a necessary preliminary of the surveying work, being undertaken before the cold weather, and delay the start of the work of the main survey party until January or February next. This would only leave three or four months for the actual surveying work—a quite impossible time—as the surveying cannot be done at the rate of more than about 1 mile per day. To complete within the option period we shall, even by commencing the reconnaissance at once, require to employ at least two or three separate parties, each taking different sections of the proposed line. Moreover, the surveyors would have no authority to discuss questions with the Persian Government, and could serve no useful purpose by going to Tehran, and to so divert them from their work, and the consequent delay would of course considerably increase the expense of the survey. In the circumstances, we trust you will agree that the proposal of the Persian Government is unreasonable, and contrary to both the spirit and letter of their option letter. We are, &amp;c. C.
