The most suitable guns would be the Q.P. 3.7-in Howitzer fitted with pneumatic tyres. This can be carried on pack and ia in general use in Waziristan. If these guns are supplied they should be sent complete with spare parts, side arms and 40 ammunition ooxes per gun. I regret that I am not able to tell you the cost price of thpse guns. To avoid any parts being omitted it would be advisable to ask the Ordnance Depot concerned to despatch guns and complete equipment for one mountain section less saddlery.

The question of the continuanoe of the Arms Traffic subsidy has therefore to be oaaaidarod. (iv) With the aid of the pr subsidy, the Sultan has almost doubled the strength and improved the efficiency of his Levy Corps. Taking advantage of the illness of the present bmm, the Sultan is at present engaged in delicate negotiations with important Shaikhs of the hinterland with a view to fulfilling his long cherished ambition of extending his influence in the interior of Oman. His success would fsvour the interests of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India as it would facilitate penetration of this area for oil development, anti locust measures etc, but it will depend largely on the extent to which the Shaikhs of the hinterland are upresaed by the armed forces which the Sultan maintains, Muscat is not. a wealthy Stats and were the war subsidy to oease without some compensatory income, at least in part substitution, it will not be possible for the Sultan to omintain his Levies at their present strength and efficiency. He is also anxious to employ thrcngh Government an Adviser for the whole State and an Administrator for Gwadur and to reform his administration generally# It is important that he should be assisted to stabilise hie position arid carry out reforms. 4. Government of India are inelined to .agree with the Political gesident's recommendation at para 3(i) above, and would be grateful for an indication from Hie Majesty’s Government as to the period for which the facilities acquired under the Pr Subsidy scheme (SBQikely to be needed. 5. As regards para 3(ii) above. Government of India hops that it will be possible to initiate negotiations for the prop Med post-war Agreement in the near future, so that they amy be concluded during the period for which it may be necessary to pay the pr Subsidy on grounds of continued use of the facilities covered by it. If, however, the negotiations are not concluded within that period, Government of India would be prepared to consider continuing the pr subsidy till the _ termination of the negotiations, provided that the allocation of expenditure as between the Government of India and His Pjesty's Government remains as at present, viz, 55 : 40. 6. Regarding para 3(iii) above, Government of India consider that resumption of the Muscat Arms Traffic subsidy should be examined as a separate ieeue altogether• As His Majesty's Government are aware, the sultan oarmot clr.im its resumption as s matter of righs* flop^tmeot s demi- official letters No. j’.132-N/30 dated 4th August 1938 and F.132(2)-*/38 dated 21 st march 1939 and emnected correspondence). The present Sultan after his accession was not only informed that the am Traffic subsidy was personal to the late Sultan but explicitly agreed in writing to Government’s 'deoieion* in his letter of the 14th neoember 1932. The Subsidy was paid till end of 1935 as a special case, in order to save toe State from financial collapse but such justification doea not exist at present. If, however. Hie Majesty's Government coneider that the Subsidy should be resumed in view of omsiderations of policy such as are indicated in para, K iv) above, it is considered that the expenditure should be divisible between the Governsent of India and Hie Pjesty'e Government and should not fall entirely on the Government of India as in the past* 7.

We think these special war subsidies should be shared in same proportion; (ll) We will not consider restoration of arms sub si dy during currency of war subsidy. Alternatively we would agree to its renewal on the old conditions, provided that war subsidy were correspondingly reduced; (III) in making offer of these subsidies to the Sultan, Political Agent should require him to state clearly scope of -the security measures to be undertaken and inform him that continued payment of war subsidy will be conditional on their prosecution; (IV) it should be clearly understood that in agreeing in this case to meet a share in war increase of expenditure in Gulf on proportional basis, we set definite geographical limit to Arab states of Koweit, Bahrain, Muscat and irueial Coast, and will accept no war expenditure outside them. 5.

The Government of India will no doubt cause a reply to be sent on the lines we have already suggested and there is no need for us to make any comment at this stage unless the Government of India ask us for our views, but we should bear this request from the Sultan in mind when we come shortly to consider the question of his position in relation to H.M.G. in the event of war. It is quite possible that we may have to offer him a subsidy but if we do I would favour a subsidy directly related to his position as our ally and not a renewal of the Arms Subsidy. 1 jl cLtOj uVf o \ c~GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. r Department. r\ * i 'a jbojjibkktial.

We agree with the view expressed by the Political Resident and the Government of India, which the India Office share, that there is no case for renewing the subsidy - in view of the sound state of the finances of Muscat and of the unlikelihood of a -recrudescence of the conditions under which the subsidy was originally granted - unless the Sultan were in any case legally entitled to it. 3. V/e do not, however, consider that the Sultan has any valid claim to the subsidy, since, even if it was not made evident to the Sultan Peisal in 1911 that the subsidy was personal to him, it is clear that the present Sultan /accepted eel, Esq., C.B.E., M.C.accepted in 1932 the decision that the Arms Traffic Subsidy, as such, should cease. 4.

JIT PROM SrCR£T,vr, POUTIOL and SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE tixy m u&gt; vKuomoL I enclose a copy of correspondence (as noted in the attached list) arising out of an application made hy the Sultan of Muscat in November, 1937&gt; for the renewal, on the grounds both of his right thereto and of the financial needs of his State, of the Arms Traffic Subsidy of Rs. 1 lakh per annum which was paid to successive Sultans from 1912 up to the end of 1935- A brief note of the history of the subsidy up to 1936 is given in Enclosure D. Reference may also be made to Metcalfe’s letter to Fowle of the 9th July last, No. D.2510-N/38? relative to oil concessions in Muscat, a copy of which was sent to the Foreign Office with India Office letter of the 21st July, No. P.^. 5028/38. 2. The Political Resident and the Government of India are agreed in thinking that there is no case for renewing the subsidy either to secure its original object, since the/ H. L. Baggallay, Esq. , Foreign Officethe danger of a recrudescence of the arms traffic is small, or because of the financial situation in Muscat, since it is considered that the finances of the State are ,.uite as sound as when the subsidy was withdrawn at the end of 1935* e agree with this view. 3 . In considering the Sultan’s claim to be ’'entitled” to the subsidy we h^ive examined its past history and recognise that certain aspects of it are favourable to the sultan’s contention, viz. - (a) The Resident’s memorandum to the Sultan of 7th November, , describes the compensation as an increase in his subsidy (cf. enclosure to India Office letter P.2063/11 of 1st January, 1912), and you will remember the views expressed as to the permanence of the (Zanzibar) subsidy in correspondence last year (cf. your letter of 11 th March, 1938? E 954/305/91); (^) Neither when the subsidy was given to Sultan Feisal nor when it was renewed to Sultan Taimur was any intimation made that it was personal to the recipient; and (c) The circumstances in which the Sultan’s predecessor, Sultan Taimur, was informed in 1923 tnat the subsidy was personal to himself (Please see paragraphs 3 ond 4 of the note forming enclosure D). It was apparently on Sultan/3. Sultan Taimur’s letter of the 19th March? 1923? that the Sultan, in the discussions in London last spring, based his contention that the oil undertaking signed by his father in 1923 was not binding on himself, and therefore that oil concessions given by him were not subject to the approval of Government. It is 'unfortunate that no ansv/er, oral or written? was apparently sent to Taimur’s letter? and this leaves us in a rather weak position for resisting any attempt by the ^resent Sultan to repudiate obligations accepted by his father in his own name only. This, however, as Metcalfe points out in his latest letter? is not likely to be of much practical importance, and he appears to consider the Sultan’s claim to the arms traffic subsidy as a matter of right to be definitely ruled out by the letters exchanged at the time of his accession. ^s you will see from the letter sent to the Sultan on the 9th .uigust, 1932 (enclosure to India Office letter P.S. 5670/32 of 21st September, 1932) and his reply of the 14th December (enclosure to India Office letter P.3.2058/ 33 of 11th April, 1933)? the Sultan accepted the decision of Government that the Arms Traffic Subsidy as such should terminate and that the annual payment of ps. 1 lakh should be continued/4. continued for only a limited period, though he did ask that the period should he reconsidered. je should he glad to learn the views of the Foreign Office in the matter. Whether any reply need he made to the Sultan at all is a separate question on which we will consult the Resident and the Government of India. If the reply is to he negative there is something to he said, in view of the time that has elapsed since the Sultan s request of November, 1937? in favour of making no reply at all anless and until he presses for one. It will of coars^ he important in the event of an emergency to make sure of the guLltan’ s goodwill. The present, therefore, is-, hardly a good time, for making a disagreeable communication to him unless it is necessary. Moreover Fowle has recently suggested for consideration that in the event oi war we snould he prepared to pay the Sultan a subsidy of the same amount (or somewhat larger) as the arms traffic subsidy.

The only question, which appears to be still outstanding, is as to the reply to be given to the Sultan’s letter of the 20th November 1937 addressed to \7atts, in which His Highness contend ed that he was entitled to the Arms Traffic Subsidy. It has, I understand, been agreed that there are not sufficient financial or practical considerations to justify the restoration of the subsidy. The only consideration of this kind which seemed to the Government of India to carry weight was the effect oi Sultan Taimur’s letter of the 19th torch 1923 protesting against the decision of Q-overnment that the subsidy was personal to himself and would not be continued to his successors. In rny letter of the 9th July 1938 I presumed that this letter had been replied to by the Resident with a personal communication RECo. POL. acce P'k or P ass on Majesty s 27MAR1939 Government, it now appears that it was not answered at all and JNDIA OFFICj^ the position then taken up by Sultan Taimur regarding his Agreements&amp; 2 - 9 4^ r~\ ny f fy*j itjCvirf Agreements with Oovernment might be regarded as having been accepted by Government, although neither His Majesty’s Govern ment or the Government of India were actually informed of the protest* Even if this be the case, it hardly appears to be of much practical importance since the only two agreements, in which the Sultan’s successors are not mentioned, are Nos* XIX and XX in Volume XI of Aitchison’s Treaties regarding the Arms Traffic Convention and Oil Concessions respectively. The first of these is of no practical importance (vide Weightraan’s demi-official letter No.C/519 of 9th August 1938) and as regards the second, I understand that the Sultan has agreed to be bound by it in practice provided certain face-saving procedure is followed* 2. There remains the question whether the original terms of the grant of the subsidy to Sultan Peisal give his successors a valid claim to its indefinite continuance* It was decided by His Majesty’s Government in consulktion with the Government of India in 1921 that Sultan Taimur was only entitled to receive the subsidy during the period of his rule and for no longer* This decision was taken after careful consideration of the circumstances in which the original grant was made to Sultan Feisal and no fresh facts have since emerged to justify reconsideration, lafoen the present Sultan’s succession was recognized the position was carefully explainedC t&gt;M ' _ to him and as I pointed out in paragraph 3 of my demi-official letter No. F. 132-N/38 of 4th August 1938 to your address the present Sultan explicitly agreed in writing to fJovernment's decision. I am therefore to suggest that the reply to the Sultan's letter of the 20th November 1937 should merely regret that His Majesty’s Government are unable to accept His Highness’ claim to the subsidy quoting as authority for this view the correspondence of August — December 1932 between Major Alban and His Highness and making no reference to any previous correspondence onjthe subject.

Fowle’s note of 31st July 1933 - Flag *E\ The departmental note on the history of the subsidy is flagged at ’B’ below. The only additional fact which has come to light as a result of the reference to India is the discovery, in the Bushire Archives, of a letter dated 19th March 1923 (copy flagged at *C’ below) addressed by Sultan Taimur to the Political Agent, Muscat, protesting against the decision to regard the subsidy as ’’personal” to himself, and declaring that if the subsidy was ’’personal” any engagements made by him in which no mention was made of his successors would not be binding on his successors. This is apparently the letter to which the present Sultan referred during his oil talks in London last April and on which he based his contention that the oil undertaking signed by his father in 1923 was not binding on himself. It appears, however, that the then Political Resident did not send the Sultan’s letter to Government and contented himself with sending a personal oral message* to Sultan Tnimur (through the Political Agent) declining to accept the letter and stating that it was most inadvisable, in the Sultan’s own interests, for any such declaration as His Highness proposed to be forwarded to Government. This message seems to have served its purpose since the Sultan did not protest further o^ insist upon his letter being forwarded. Thus, so far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned, the matter rested, (until the present Sultan’s accession), with the decision communicated to Sultan Taimur in writing on/ 7173 Wt 8900/1 11 10.000 1.38on 24th February 1923 that the subsidy would ,f be maintained so long as the present Sultan of Muscat continues to rule but no longer'. It is perhaps a little unfortunate that a written reply was not made to Sultan Taimur's letter; but since he did not protest further, or insist on his letter being forwarded to Government, we can, it is submitted, accept the Government of India’s view that his letter does not prejudice Government’s position that the subsidy was ’’personal' or that it justifies the present Sultan’s repudiation of his father’s undertakings. Nothing more was heard about the subsidy from the Muscat side until Sultan Taimur’s abdication in 1932 but on that occasion Government’s position was stated in the plainest terms and in the light of x the correspondence which then passed between Sultan Said and the Political Agent it is difficult to see x (D on what ground His Highness can claim continuance of the subsidy as a matter of right. As regards the other considerations which might be held to warrant a renewal of the subsidy the Government of India agree with the Political Resident that neither the financial situation in Muscat nor the danger of a recrudescence of the Arms Traffic providefany good ground for its renewal and they are unwilling to contribute towards the subsidy solely in order to obtain greater control over the Sultan’s foreign relations. We have no good reason for dissenting from the Government of India’s views on these points. To sum up the Sultan has no valid ; ground for claiming that he is entitled to the subsidy ( 2 ; Letter to Sultan of 9th August 1932 at P. Z. 5670/32 in Col. 20/2.

The history of the subsidy is summarised in the departmental note which formed an enclosure to Peel’s letter to Metcalfe of the 14th June and as you will see the ondy additional fact which has since come to light is the discovery, in the Bushire Archives , of a letter dated 19th March 1923 addressed by Sultan Taimur to the Political Agent, Muscat, protesting against the decision to regard the subsidy as ’’personal” to himself and declaring that if the subsidy was 'personal' any engagements made by him in which no mention was made of his sue cessors/successors would rot Toe 'binding on his of a covering letter dated 20th June from Fowle to Metcslfe was sent to the Foreign Office with our printed letter of the 15th June 1938, No.P.Z. 4509/38.

It is perhaps a little unfortunate that a Written reply was not sent to Sultan Taimur’s letter but since, after receiving the Political Resident’s message, His Highness did not protest further or insist on his letter being forwarded, we agree with the Government of India in thinking that the letter in question does not prejudice Government’s position that the subsidy was 'personal' or that it in any way justifies the present Sultan’s attempted repudiation of his father’s undertakings. Further, in the light of the marginally noted correspondence which passed between the Political Agent, Muscat, and Sultan Said at the time of the latter’s accession, it is difficult to see on what ground His Highness can claim the continuance of the subsidy as a matter of right and we agree with the Government of India’s view that in present circumstances there are no other considerations of sufficient weight to justify its renewal.

On the other hand the whole question was carefully examined in 1921*1923 and Sultan Taimur was informed in writing that the subsidy would *be maintained so long as the present Sultan of Maskat continues to rule but no longer*.

In paragraph 3 of your letter you ask for the views of the Government of India on certain other considerations which might be held to warrant a renewal of the subsidy.

It is clear that Government intended thcit the subsidy should be personal to Saiyid Faisal but it is not clear that this was ever ex plained to him.

My dear Peel, Would you kindly refer to your demi-official letter No.P.Z.3179/38 dated the 10th May 1938, regarding the oil concessions granted by the Sultan of Muscat to Petroleum Concessions Limited? 2. You will have received Fowle’s comments contained in his demi-official letter No.C/351 of the 20th June 1938 of which a copy was sent to you. The Government of India agree with these comments as stated in paragraphs 2 to 7 of his letter and with his proposals as to the procedure to be adopted regarding the Political Agreement and Draft Letter No. I. 3. Fowle has now produced a copy of Sultan Said Taimur’s letter of the 19th March 1923, which the present Sultan has quoted, but he has not commented on the effect which this letter has on the Sultan’s repudiation of his father’s obligations. It seems to the Government of India that the 1 matter is not entirely free from difficulty, since it is clear that Sultan Taimur in 1923 definitely declared that no agreement entered into by him would be binding upon his successors, unless the agreement itself contained a mention of the successors. The undertaking regarding oil contained in the letter to Major Rae of the 10th January 1923 (vide Aitchison’s Treaties Vol.XI page 319) includes no mention of his successors, so that there is some force in the Sultan’s argument that, in view of his father’s letter, the undertaking with regard to oil did not descend to him and was not coveredN V by his own letter of 10th February 1932. His Majesty’s Government can presumably reply that the Political Resident of the time declined to accept Sultan Taimur’s letter, and conveyed a personal message to the Sultan through the Political Agent, Muscat that it would be most inadvisable in the Sultan’s own interest for any such j general declaration as His Highness proposed to be forwarded to Government. The Sultan did not protest or insist upon his declaration being forwarded and since neither the Government of India nor His Majesty’s Government were informed of the letter, they do not consider themselves bound by its terms. The validity of suah a rejoinder is perhaps open to doubt, but it appears from your letter P.Z. 2210/38 of the 19th May 1938 that His Highness the Sultan is actuated rather by motives of prestige than by any desire to embarrass Government and if his ”amour propre” is satisfied by the procedure now suggested by Fowle, it is perhaps unnecessary to pursue the question further in connection with the undertaking of 1923 regarding oil. I am sending a copy of this letter to Fowle. Yours sincerely, Sgd. H. A.F.METCALFE. R. T. Peel, Esq. , M.C. , India Office, London.P.Z.5028/38 NO.D.2510-N/38 Simla, the 9th July 1938. 11th My dear Powle, Please refer to my demi-official letter No.D.2510-N/38 to Peel with copy to you regarding the Sultan of Muscat^ attitude towards his liability under the oil undertaking of 1923. As you will see, the Government of India have takoi the view that Sultan Taimur's letter of March 1923 does not justify the present Sultans repudiation of his father’s undertakings, since that letter was never accepted by His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India. I do not know, however, how far that argument would be valid and I have therefore examined as a matter of interest the other undertakings given by Sultan Taimur regarding which the present Sultan could take up a similar attitude. So far as I can discover from Aitchison’s Treaties the only other undertaking of a perpetual nature entered into by Sultan Taimur was No.XIX of the 17th February 1921 adhering to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919. In this undertaking there is no mention of the Sultan’s successors, so that the position is precisely the same as in the case of No.XX regarditg oil. I am not sure whether the Sultan of Muscat’s adherence to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919 is at present of any practical importance or not. Would you be kind enough to give us your views on this point and also let us know ^f 'there are any other undertakings of Sultan Laimur s which might be affected by the present Sultan’s argument.

The Sultan originally objected to Article 3 of the Political Agreement, also to the last sentence of Draft Letter No.l, vide paragraph 3 of Gibson’s Note of 27th April. 3 . The situation now is, briefly, as follows. The Sultan has agreed to talcing cognisance of the Political Agreement with Article 3 as altered in paragraph 1 of Gibson’s Note- of 29th Ap&gt;ril. ; .I see no objection to this alteration. 4 # There are also the Sultan’s minor suggestions in the same paragraph of Gibson’s Note on Articles 5, 7 and 8 , l agree that the Sultan’s wishes could be met. 5 # With regard to Draft Letter No.l to the Sultan. (i) The Sultan has asked that the opening words should indicate by whom His Majesty’s Government were furnished with a copy of the Concessions (paragraoh 1 of Gibson’s Note oi 29th April)• This presumably will be met by the insertion of the words ’’Petroleum Concessions Limited” after the word ’’furnished”. (ii) The proposal is to omit the second half oi the last sentence from the words beginning ’’after/ Sir Aubrey Metcalfe,KCIE.,CSI.,MV0 ., ^ Secretary to the Government of India- in the External Affairs Department, Simla.sent un ider P.L.Ho.G/352 of 20/6/38. 'after which'. This the Sultan has accepted (paragraph 1 of Gibson’s Uote of 29th April). 6 . The Sultan, however, stated that while recognising that the correspondence would close by his receipt or a letter that His Majesty’s Government approved of the Concessions, he would not acknowledge its receipt (paragraph 5 of Gibson’s Mote of 29th April). Since uhe Sultan has said that he will accept this letter, i.e. he has not said that he will return it, from our point of view this seems adequate. 7 . As I understand it, no action can be taken until the Government of India and the foreign Office have concurred in the procedure outlined above. 8 . Y/ith regard to the letter of the Sultan’s fatner, Said Taimur, referred to in paragraph 3 of Peel's letter to you of 10th May. I have now found this in my archives, and attach a translation herewith, together with the reply of the Resident at that time and of the Resident’s Secretary’s forwarding letter to the Political Agent, Muscat.

We contradicted him saying that such compensation cannot be meant for that person in particular who rules this state, but its profit is meant for him and his successors in the State of Muscat and Oman. Undoubtedly what Sir Percy Cox promised to our late father Saiyid Faisal for this important matter was for the State and not for him (S.Faisal) personally. And as we agreed with you to abide by the promises of our predecessors, so our successors will also do accordingly in this respect, that is after agreement with you this subsidy will be continued. We with great sorrow explain to the High Government in this our letter that all promises, treaties, conditions and agreements made by us or which may be made, 1 an d in which no mention is made about our successors, are not binding upon them, and they themselves and their government may act as they wish if such agreements should be against their interest, and every one of us will observe them only for the time of the contracting government or for hi* person and i government. d Ngovernment.

This request hy the Sultan would appear to be rather a ’’try on”. He must know perfectly well that there is no question of his being ’’entitled” to the arms subsidy as he claims, and as Mr. Gibson shows ; the financial position of his State is quite satisfactory. If he should try to press the argument that it is so only because of stringent economies it would be relevant to draw his attention to the considerable sums paid to him by Petroleum Concessions Limited which he is apparently putting into his own pocket and to suggest to him that he might follow the example of the Sheikh of Bahrein wno allots two-thirds of his oil revenues to his State and only retains one-third for his privy purse. The authorities in the Persian Gulf are agreed that there is little risk of a revival of gun-running from Muscat if the arms subsidy is not renewed. While as regards the question of our obtaining greater control over the Sultan’s affairs it may be pointed out that the Sultan is already bound by the assurance which he gave in 1932 that he would be guided by the views of His Majesty’s Government in important matters, and in 1936 Major Watts laid stress on the realisationthe Sultan of the complete and utter dependence of his State for i If . continual existence 00 its support from His Majesty s Government^, a support which he was not likely to jeopardize by any action of nature likely to be considered unfriendly.

Would you kindly refer to your demi-official letter of the 19th April, No.D.1204-N/38, on the subject of the arms traffic subsidy formerly paid to the Sultan of Muscat. 2. The Sultan made no reference while in London to his request for the renewal of the subsidy. It is necessary however to send a reply to the Sultan’s letter of the 20th November 1937 (copy enclosed with Fowle’s letter to you of the 17th March, No.2C4-S). The Secretary of State notes that in this letter the Sultan claims that he is entitled to the subsidy. Before deciding on the terms of the reply to be sent to the Sultan the Secretary of State would be glad to receive the views of the Government of India on this claim in the light of the history of the subsidy. In this connection I am to enclose copy of a note prepared in this Office from which it appears that the subsidy was intended as compensation for loss of revenue from duty on imported arms, that there is no record of Sultan Faisal being told that the subsidy was personal to him, and that on Sultan Taimur claiming that as he had undertaken his father’s obligations, the allowancefpaid to his father should be continued/2 . continue^ it was decided to continue the subsidy on condition that revision of the 1891 Treaty was postponed. 3. Certain other considerations which might be held to warrant a renewal of the subsidy have been discussed in Fowle 1 s letter of the 17th March. They are (a) A serious deterioration in the Muscat financial position.On the facts mentioned in Fowle’s letter there is no evidence of any immediate danger of this, even allowing for the small decrease in revenue which will result from the decision not to renew the Civil Air Agreement consequent upon the transfer of the Imperial Airways base from Gwadur to Jiunri. (b) to prevent a recrudescence of the Arms Traffic. It is noted that in Fowle ! s view there is no real danger of the renewal of gun-running from Muscat and that the Government of India think that if the arms traffic should ever become a live issue it could be dealt with by other means than the grant of a subsidy (Parsons’ telegram to Walton of the 12th September, No. 1946). It /~P.Z. 6043/377 would be useful hov/ever if Fowle could give us a further expression of his views on this point in the light of the evidence which has recently come to notice of the existence of a certain amount of traffic in arms across the Persian Gulf via Debai.

It was fortunately not found necessary in London to contemplate the use of such a 'bargaining factor, and it may he improbable that any financial inducement will be needed to obtain the Sultanas signature to the Treaty. It may be relevant, however, to note that the continuance of the subsidy to Sultan Taimur was linked with the question of the Commercial Treaty as mentioned S * \ above. ^ (d) the acquisition of increased political control in Muscat. As Fowle says, if the subsidy is to be given for this reason a definite undertaking would have to be obtained from the Sultan. Such an undertaking would have to be framed in such a way as not to infringe the Anglo-French declaration of 1862 regarding the independence of Muscat, or alternatively the consent of the French l* Government would have to be secured*, in seeking such an undertaking we should also have to reckon with the Sultan’s extreme sensitiveness on the matter of ^ his independent status. The case for i granting the subsidy in order to strengthen British influence in Muscat would have been fortified if the Sultan had shown any disposition throughout his world tour to seek the friendship of aforeign power in substitution for his present relationship with H.M.G. There was no evidence of such a tendency in the Sultan’s conversations in London, and none has come to light in such reports as have hitherto been received on his visits to other countries. 4. The Secretary of State would be glad of the Government of India’s views on the above points as well as on the question referred to in para.2 above of the Sultan’s claim that he is entitled to the subsidy. 5.

The subsidy v/as intended as compensation for the loss the Sultan would, suffer from the reduction in revenue derived from import duty on imported arms. As^submitted to the Secretary of State for approval the grant of the subsidy was to be personal to Saiyid Faisal. (Ten years later it v/as discovered that tnere was no evidence that this condition had been communicated to the Sultan). 2. Sultan Saiyid Faisal died on 4th October 1913. In the ^letter sent to S aiyid^ Taimur on 14th November, acknowledging his acceptance of his father’s obligations and conveying recognition of his succession, the Political Agent said tnat the question of the x subsidies received by Faisal was being considered separately. The Sultan wrote back expressing surprise and saying he hoped that if he accepted his father’s obligations the allowances paid to his father would be continued to him. On 17th January the Secretary of State authorised payment ol the Muscat subsidies (Zanzibar subsidy and arms traffic suosidy) on condition that revision of the 1891 Commercial Treaty was postponed for a numoer of years. Apparently tne Sultan accepted the condition. There is nothing in our records to show that it was appreciated at the time that the two suosidies were different in kind, and in particular that the arms traffic subsidy had been intended to be personal to Saiyid Faisal. Both subsidies were treated alike and their renev/al to Saiyid matter of -urgency in consideration of i Taimur was agreed to as aP.372y/^1 P.5134/21 P.1589/23 v Vf i ' rv P.S.1999/32 the financial straits in which the new Sultan found himself. 3. In 1921 the Government of India consulted the Political Resident on the question of reducing the arms traffic subsidy. The Political Resident was of opinion that the subsidy was no longer necessary, that it should be maintained during the rule of Saiyid Taimur, but that when he ceased to rule it should be stopped. The Government of India submitted a proposal to this effect to the Secretary of State, adding that the circumstances of the two subsidies should be explained to the Sultan in order to avoid the possibility of a misunderstanding in the future. His Majesty^ Government approved. When the Political Agent conveyed the decision to the Sultan the latter ashed il it . as really the case that the grant of the arms traffic subsidy was personal to his father. Examination of Government files failed to show that Saiyid Faisal had been told that the subsidy was personal, and in the circumstances the Political Agent suggested that, in place of a statement that the subsidy would cease when Saiyid Taimur ceased to rule, the Sultan might be told that in that event the matter would be reconsidered and the question oi the withdrawal or curtailment of the subsidy treated as one of expediency in the light of the circumstances then existing. The Government of India refused, however, to modify the decision that the subsidy would ”be maintained so long as the present Sultan of Muscat continues to rule but no longer’ 1 . This decision was conveyed to the Sultan in writing on 24th February, 1923. The present Sultan succeeded towards the end of 1931 on the abdication of his father. Muscat finances were then in a very critical state. The Government of India proposed in March 19o2 that as the arms traffic subsidy was personal to the late Sultan it should cease, at any rate under its existing designation. But to prevent the State from falling into complete/complete financial chaos they proposed to continue the payment of Rs.l lakh for a period of 3 years. They added 'We are however of opinion that the continuance of this subsidy, whether now or on the expiry of this period, is merely a question of expediency and vie suggest that it should, be made clear to the new Sultan and the State Council that further extension cannot be counted on and that consequently during the next three years the finances of the State must be so organised that it will be able to meet the loss of the subsidy at the close of the period'. The Secretary of State sanctioned the proposals. In 1934 it was felt that the improvement in the finances of Muscat was not enough to justify discontinuance of the subsidy and it was decided to extend payment for one more year. The subsidy was accordingly paid up to the end of 1935, but Jr having regard to the improved state of the Muscat finances it v/as decided that there was insufficient justification for extending payment beyond the 1st January, 1936.State, and only keeps i/ 3r&lt;i for hiB kTi vy iurM# 7* Broaij the therefore, I aw still of the opinion 3 ^'(vide ray aeiaora^dun -to»5Sh*»3 aatsd the 30th April 1935; thc*t on financial grounds the Sultan hue no olaira on His Majesty's Govern- ment foi* the resumption of the Arma Traffic hubeidy# 6. with regard to otiier nor^-finanoial oonsiderations ( a ) to prevent the Sultan exercising Ms apparent right to resinse the Anas Traffic*# In this connection as you will see from paragraph 3 (3) of my dewi-official letter ‘0.526-3 of the 1 st July 1936 to Jaroe i do not think that there is an/ real danger of renewal of gun-running from Muscat (b) as an induonsent to the Sultan to be reasonable over the Treaty.

Please convey this to tne Government of India as early as possible. * as in originalExtract from letter from Sir Aubrey Metcalfe to Mr. Walton dated 24th March, 1938. 4(b) The question of the Arms Traffic Subsidy. You suggest that the Sultan should be informed during his visit to London, if he raises the question, that the matter is already under the consideration of the Government of India. As you will remember the present position is that the Sultan v/as told by me in Delhi that if he made an application for restoration of the subsidy through the Political Resident it would be considered. I have just received Fowle's demi-official letter No.204—S. of 17th March of which a copy has gone to you. In this is enclosed a copy of a letter from His Highness to Watts dated the 20th November 1937 asking for restoration mainly on the ground of the financial necessities of the State. Fowle does not regard finance as a valid argument for restoration and thinks that it could only be justified if the Sultan agrees to give us considerably more control over him and his State, than we at present exercise. As Fowle says this v/ill be a difficult matter and the whole question will of course require careful consideration aid consultation between His/His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. One issue will certainly be raised, viz., by whom the subsidy is to be paid, if it is eventually decided to restore it. I have not yet had time to take the Viceroy’s instructions or to consult other Departments but I feel quite sure that the Government of India will take the strongest objection to accepting responsibility for any part ofthe payment even though they may agree that restoration is desirable. Unless therefore His Majesty’s Government are prepared to accept full responsibility for this annual lakh of rupees, in case it is decided to restore the subsidy, it is obviously necessary to avoid at present giving His Highness any reason to believe that the subsidy will be restored or cause to reproach us with breach of faith, if the decision is ultimately unfavourable. On the other hand it would be correct now to say that the matter is under consideration and we should have no objection to the Sultan being so informed, if he raises the matter, provided you make it clear (a) that the matter is one which concerns not only the/4 Pt yp\RT CrT P.Z.1180/38 AIR MAIL Confidential.

With regard to paragraph 5 of your letter, we shall be telegraphing to you in the course of the next few days. 1 Yours ever, (3d.) H.A.F. Metcalfe J.C.

I sent a copy of tne same note to Faiton and enclose for your information a copy of extracts from the letter which I have received from him in reply. 2. You will no doubt agree, as we do, with Walton's general remarks as to the desirability of maintaining as friendly relations as possible with the Sultan at the present juncture. With regard to paragraph 35 nothing was said here about any proposal to visit Italy and I do not suppose that you have any further information. Personally I should be inclined to deprecate any attempt to dissuade His Highness from going there, if he has made up his mind to do so. That opinion is however based on a comparatively slight acquaintance with the Sultan and I should be grateful for your views on the question raised by Walton at the end of paragraph 3• 3« In paragraph 4 of his letter Falton raises two questions: (a) that of 'providing the Sultan with a British Officer. i?e have already had some Private and Personal correspondence on this subject and I have written to you deini-officially asking for your general views.

You will remember the previous correspondence on the subject which I have again examined. It was agreed between us in 1935&gt; when we were both at home, that there was no justification for making any further recommendation for the continuance of the subsidy. In this connection please see your demi-official le tter No.548-S. dated the 7th November 1935. There was some subsequent correspondence in 1936 (vide your demi- official letter No.526-3 . of 1936 , dated the 1st July 1936 to Caroe) in which reference was made to the Sultan’s liberation from his previous agreement with regard to the arms traffic by reason of the withdrawal of the subsidy. The recent interest shown by both the Japanese and Italians in the Persian G-ulf might possibly provide a reason for revising the attitude towards this question which you took up in 1935 and 1936. If therefore you like to raise the question of the subsidy without waiting for a direct application from the Sultan, I would certainly have it considered here and it would then be possible to agree with the suggestions made by Walton in paragraph q. of his letter. 4* I am sending a copy of this letter to Walton and it might perhaps save time if you sent a copy of your reply direct to him. Yours sincerely, (3d.) H.A.F. Metcalfe The Hon’ble Lieutenant Colonel Sir '-^renchard Powle , K. 0. I. L. ,C. 3.E. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.P.Z.8203/37. Extract from letter from Mr. Walton to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, dated 13th January 1938. 4. As a means of helping to maintain and strengthen friendly relations with the Sultan the Government of India will agree that it is desirable to do anything that may be possible to remove any grievances which the Sultan may feel on minor matters, and to give him any small favours which may be practicable. The Government of India will no doubt bear this consideration in view in considering the matters which the Sultan raised in his discussion with you. Two at least of the questions discussed, hov/ever, appear to be of considerable importance, viz. the provision of the services of a British officer as Yfazir, and the question of the Arms Traffic subsidy. As regards the first question it seems to us that it would be desirable, not only as a means of gratifying the Sultan, but also from the point of view of our own interests, to provide him with the services of a British officer to give him 'expert advice in the management of his foreign relations', since this is just the point at which it is so important to preserve our influence, and on which there may be some risk of his breaking away. We therefore greatly hope that it will be possible to lend the services of a suitable officer (if not Colonel Bremner then at any rate some other officer) for this purpose. As regards the Arms subsidy we must of course await the examination of the question by the Government of India. If, hov/ever, the -Sultan should return to this question during his visit to London, it would be of advantage if we could tell him that the Government of India already have it under consideration. Generally/2 Generally speaking, we should be glad if as much progress as possible could be made in examining the questions, both small and great, which were raised by the Sultan in India, and where this is possible, without waiting for His Highness’s return to Muscat. As regards point 6 in the note of your discussion, the payment in question has now been made, and the question referred to in point 5 is also being dealt with.(9) Arms 'Traffic ^ubsldff . The subsidy of Hs.1,00,000 per annum was discontinued from 1st January, 1936, 'subject to general examination of the Muscat financial situation in about two years 1 time'. (Jee P.Z. 38/36). We must await the views of the Government of India and the Political Resident in regard to this matter,&lt;?- r.om : 4 i- w I (®&gt; I Q ^ O Extract from Not© of © Aioc&amp;SflifQ 3 l JifiJ/d. on 17,11. »37. between Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary,External Affairs Department, and His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, at which the Political Agent, Muscat, was also present. ( 9 ) Arms Traffic Subsidy . The Sultan referred to his desire which he had mentioned he stated at his interview with His Excellency of being granted a resumption of the Arms Subsidy. He said at the present time there was 'a lack of rupees” in his State and though its financial condition was just solvent, there were insufficient funds to carry out the numerous measures required for its improvement and progress. Secretary pointed out that the Arms Traffic subsidy was originally granted to the Sultan's grandfather as a personal concession to compensate him for any losses he may have incurred on assisting the British Government to suppress 'the Arms Traffic. Secretary asked the Sultan if the Arms Warehouse in Muscat was still in use. The Sultan replied that since his father and himself had forbidden traffic in arms, importers had given up using the Warehouse, but that if he removed the restriction, he thought they would speedily resume trade in these articles. Secretary told the Sultan if he desired a resumption | of the Arms Subsidy, he should apply formally through the usual channels stating the grounds on which he asked for it. When the application was received, the question then vrould be considered by the Government of India. / 'j9 Extract from Note of an i iitetiKfiJfen His Extract xrom nui/e ux axi chiton Excellency the Viceroy, and His Highness the SuUan of Muscat, at which Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary, External Affairs Department, v/as also present. i 5 . Lastly His Highness spoke about the arms subsidy of one lakh per annum which he enjoyed on a temporary oasis until about a year ago. This subsidy, which was paid entirely by the Government of India nominally in order to prevent the Sultan from conniving at the arms traffic, was personal to His Highness' father and could therefore have been stopped when the present Sultan succeeded about two years ago. It was however continued on a temporary basis under considerable protest from the Finance Department and the Political Besident was asked demi- officially to furnish full justification for its continuance. As the result of considerable discussion Colonel Fowls finally gave as his considered opinion that there was no justification whatever for continuing it after December 1935 and it has accordingly ceased. The difficulty of justifying its revival is that arms tramc in the Persian Gulf is practically dead and it is doubtful if the Sultan could revive it unless he obtained very large supplies from Japan or Italy or some other country unfavourably disposed towards us. Equally the Muscat finances have recently improved owing to a contract with the Petroleum Concessions Company for oil which provides him with a regular income of about Bs.7,000/- a month, political Resident has reported that his financial position is satisfactory and the only argument which we could use in favour of the restoration of the subsidy would be a general political one that the friendship of the Sultan is of value to us in connection with the facilities which he provides at/I 2 . at Gwadur for the Imperial Airways and on the Muscat coast for the R.A.F. emergency route to Aden. He is already in receipt of rent of £ 1 , 000 /- per annum for the aerodrome at Gwadur and when the existing agreement expires in 1938 I understand that he intends to raise the rent, if he can, and also to charge as much rent as he can secure for the use of Gwadur harbour by flying boats. It would probably therefore be unwise to give him any concessions in regard to the arms subsidy until we have him tied under a fresh agreement for air facilities at Gwadur. I suggest that this matter might be discussed in more detail with Major Watts and possibly also with Mr. Oaroe when the latter goes through Delhi towards the end of this month.JKL/AW, (64 groups) CORY (UGJ ^ 6043 S 19 37 ) 4211* P E G Y P H J '.

Although it was apparently the intention that the suosidy should also be personal to Sultan Saiyid, this was not made clear at the time but in 1922 when the question was re-examined Sultan Saiyid was informed in writing that while the subsidy would be continued to him during his tenure of power it would not be admissible to his successor (see correspondence at P.4180,/21 in the oound volume).xir «' - imho tspnanssiMm^wvMHnMR 3.

This period was subsequently extended by a further year (see P.Z.7121/34 - copy in Colin.20/2). 4.

A copy ox my demi-official letter jmo. 107 -S d ated the 12th ^bruary 1936, referred to by Caroe, was forwarded to you under my Printed letter xio.lQS.S of the same date. 2 . x x x x x x x x x x x xx 3« As regards the Arms Traffic Subsidy* As pointed out by Caroe, the Sultans engagement was definitely in the nature of a quid pro quo and as we have on our part cancelled the quo i.e. the Arms Subsidy, personally I am of opinio- that in equity, and probably in law, the Sultan on ^ ~ s ^ a. is released from the quid i.e* his engagement ot 1912. This, as you will see, is Caroe's opinion also. 4* In these circumstances it is necessary to consider (a) whether there are any other restrictions on the Sultan to prevent his engaging, if he so desires, in the Arms Traffic, and (b) whether it is necessary to engage in any fresh agreement with Euswat in this matter. 5. As regards (a). The 1919 Arms Traffic C 0 nvention, to which the Sultan adhered, has been replaced by the 1925 Convention, to which the bultan did no c adhere, ani which itself has not yet been brought into operation as it has hitherto / Major R.P.Watts, I.A., Political Agent, Muscat•- £. hitherto been ratified onlj by the United Kingdom, Iraq una United fJtates of America. 6. The wultan’s Procla^iatton and Uottfication dated 13th January 1898 (‘f*reatiea and Undertakings in Force between the British Government and the Sultans of Muccat and Oman 184b- 1914 Ko.S (a) and 8 (b) respectively) prohibit the export of arms and ammunition from Muscat to India and Persia ana give British ancPerslai veseels of war the right to search Kuscat vessels in the India) , Persirn and Muscat territorial waters. Owing to the right that these two documents accord to Persian vessels of war It is undes.iraole to craw attention to them; in fact, in connection with the general question of the Arms 'Taffic Convention tae view was expressed by the Inula Office that it might be desirable to advise tae Sultan to cancel the Proclamation of 1898. -Moreover they are of a unilateral nature and there is presumacly nothing inherent in restricting the Sultan from going contrary to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Arms rai ic. them to prever; ^t the Sultan annulling them on hie own initiative. As, however, the latter war? the occasion of a definite na we on our sine nave cancelled this assurance to make the Sultan keep his part. there would k not app®&amp;- ear to be muen inducement xor tne i&gt;ulx-an /-3- Sultan to encourage the use of insert as a basts tor the Anis Traffic. For his own sake he is not likely to encourage the importation of arms for sale in his own territories, where th«y might well be used against him by the Omani tribes. As far as the Saudi Government is concerned they are in a position to import their arms direct from the manufacturers in any country they like, and are therefore most unlikely to procure arms indirectly via Muscat. Owing to the disarming of the tribes in Persian Baluchistan and the increasing authority there of the Central Government thef&lt;r mer traffic has shrunk in a negligible trickle. Owing to changed conditions X uo not think that there is any necessity at present for is to enter into any fresh agreement with Jtoscat. It is possible that the Sultan, though he is a shrewd individual, may not grasp the nuid nro cup arguments given in paragraph 3 above, a nc if this is so, X oo not think that it is up to us to bring the point to his notice. If the point does strike him, he will undoubtedly address us on the subject (probably with the idea of getting his Arms Subsidy restorea) before he takes any action as to the import of arms, ano we can then consioer finally what course we should adopt. 9 . Please let me have your own views, treating the .matter as secret. Yours sincerely, sd. T.O.?owle.Confidential ' JJ.O.Mo.C-70. Jane 10th, 1936* Dear Colonel Fowle, Please refer to your D*0. No. 318-3 of 20th April 1936. 2. The question whether the 1926 Convention is invald in view of the fact that not all the signatories have ratd fled it and the Sultan has not adhered to it or whether tl present signatories carry out its provisions so far as th&lt; themselves and the other signatories are concerned, is X take it rather a fine point of international law which wi: have to he thrashed out by the legal experts. 3. There seems to me , however, to be not the least doubt that the withdrawal of the ^rms Subsidy by us has given the Sultan a full legal and moral right to permit the traffic of arms in Muscat territory if he wished to d so as explained in paragraph 3 of your letter under refe rence* 4. *s regards the practical problem to be considered as to whether the Sultan, in the improbable event of his realising the fact that he is now free to allow the traff'^ of munitions, is ever likely to avail himself of this right, X am very definitely of the opinion that there is vio danger of his even attempting such a thing. There are t\*o main reasons which 1 consider would effectively prevent him in engaging In such a course of action. 6. First, the complete absence of any real inducemen The Hon r ble Lieut-Colonel T.C. Fowle, C.B.ii., Political resident in the Persian Qulf, Bushire.- 2 - nowadays to engage in the arms trade as detailed in paragraph 8 of your letter. I think that the Sultan would he exceedingly chary of allowing the importation of arms into Muscat with the object of re-export and sale since it is obvious that it would not be difficult for the Omanis to get hold of some of these weapons and he would then be hoist with his own petard with a vengeance# In fact it can safely be said that in these days so far as Muscat is concerned the bottom has dropped out of the Arms Traffic market. 6 . There is however another reason which even more powerfully than those above mentioned would,I believe, operate to prevent the Sultan from ever venturing to allow or encourage traffic in arms and that is his realisation of the complete and utter dependence of his State for its continued existence, upon the support of His Majesty's Government. His Highness is under ne delusions in this respect and the fear of the conse quences would, I believe, always debar him from doing anything, which although he might have legal and moral right on his side, would, he knows nevertheless,scarcely fail to be considered as amounting to a hostile act \ against Great Britain. In the course of conversation with the Sultan during my last visit to Iftiofar he remarked that he fully realised that his State derived considerably more advantages from its close connection with His Majesty's Government than the latter did from any treaties or agreements entered into between the two countries# 7. Under the circumstances I am in complete agreement with the views expressed in paragraph 8 of your letter that it is not necessary at present for us to enter into any fresh agreement with the Sultan and should the fact ever strike him that he is now free fromfrom his obligations not to allow traffic in anas, he would undoubtedly address us in the laatter before taking any action. Then but not before it would be necessary to take up the question. Yours sincerely, Sd. MiTTS.J w - r i8 conf identlel. / ^ *. D a O,^o&gt; 1Q7-S of 1936, ^ute&amp;ire/£he 12th February 1936. Vvy . c- v M Could you pleftae refer to your demi-official letter Ho.D.178-H/36 of the 21st January 1936, enclosing an interesting &gt;! ote prepared by the Director, Intelligence Bureau, on the subject of the activities of fHr Caimur bin Faisal alias l.F.T. Al Said, the ex-Sultan of Muscat. 2. Al Said’s wanderings appear rather mysterious but as you point out it is quite possible he may be looking to trade in partnership with his son, the present aultan, to supplement his straightened means, and if so would naturally like to keep hie activities dark. The money mentioned in paragraph 6 of the Intelligence Bureau Kote might have reference to such transactions. The further reference to Saifar (or Ilaffar) in the same paragraph is doubtless Dhofar, where the present Bui tan now is. Dhofar is a fertile part of the Sultan’s dominions and he has displayed considerable interest in increasing its prosperity. r 3. iftth regard to your suggestion that Dhofar would be an easy destination for arms smuggling from »&gt;apan, the sultan can purchase arms for himself and hie soldiers quite openly. If from India the usual 'Bo Objection” statement from me is required} but this is only from the point of view oi export from India. The Bultan can purchase arms from any country he likes, by the terms of Article 7 of the 1891 Treaty. On the other hand, he is still bound by his Notification of 1st June 1912, in which he undertook, among other things, that all arms / o.K.Caroe ^squire,CIK., Deputy Secretary (Foreign) to the Government of India, New Delhi. X 4w i t ^arms and ammunition imported into his territories should pass through the special warehouse at Muscat * &lt;t must be note! that no restriction on the juantity of arms imported into Muscat was ever imposed; and the suppression of the arras traffic was apparently brought about in virtue of No.11 of the rules for the management of the arms warehouse put into effect by the Sultan 1 s Proclamation of 1st September 1912, which empoY^ers the warehouse Superintendent to refuse a license for the issue of arras to any person who, he has reason to suppose, intends them for re-sale. 4 . in view of the above facts, 1 can only suppose that if it be true that the Sultan with the assistance of his father proposes importing Japanese arms into the country via Bhofur it is with the idea that His Majesty’s Government might possibly object to his importing large quantities of Japanese anus. Of course, by shipping them to Dhofar, instead of Muscat, he would be breaking the terns of the Notification of 1st June 1912. 5. With regard to the Japanese Government appointing a representative in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of promoting Japanese shipping interests (vide paragraph 2 of the Intelligence Bureau Note) this concerns our Minister at Jedda more than it does me and the appointment of such &amp; representative would appear to be quite legitimate. 6. ^ith regard to paragraphs 3 and 9 of the Intelligence Bureau Note. The Sultan, unlike the Rulers of Bahrain and Kuwait, can enter into Treaties with other Powers besides ourselves (he has already Treaties with Prance, America and Holland, besides His Majesty’s Government) but if he did so«* 3- he would make It for the whole of hie territory and not one part of it. Bren if he does not contemplate Treaties, he would be doubt!ens glad of arms and aarnunition to retake the highlands of Oman which were loet during the time of nis father, from the present Imam, who has practically independent rule over them# 7, I am eending a copy of tnis letter, together with a copy of youre and ite encloaure, to ifette for his coranents.

Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi, The Ji P ril 19^ . r\ . s y fill you please refer to your demi-official letter So. 107-3, dated the 12th februery 1936, on the subject of the activities of the ex-Sultan of Muscat? You will remember that this point was discussed in Delhi, and that it was pointed out that the Sultan's engagement under his notification of the let June 1912, whereby he undertook that all arms imported should pass throu^J a special warehouse at Muscat, was definitely in the nature of a qaiu aco im* The terms on which he agreed to this settlement were that he should receive in oompeneation an annual payment of Bs. 1 lakh. The point is mentioned in paragraphs 11-13 of the India Office Muscat Memorandum revised up to the 25th August 1928. In as much as the annual arms subsidy has been discontinued with effect from the 1st January 1936, it would appear that the Sultan ie now released from his engagement in this respect. 2. It is true that Muscat adhered to the 1919 Anas Traffic Convention. This, however, was replaced by the 1925 Arms Traffic Convention, which itself has not yet been brought into operation as it has hitherto only been ratii iai by the United Kingdom, Iraq, and toe United dtatee of America, and the Sultan does not appear to have adhered to it. 3. It seems therefore that the Sultan is now under no engagemento on^agement to prevent tr ffic in anas into and through his territories* This point does not seem to have been realised at the time when it was decided to agree to the discontinuance of the Arras Subsidy with effect from last January (see your demi-official letter to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe No # 848-&gt; f dated the 7th November 1^3^.

There is nothing to show that he is engaged on any subversive activity. The tone of his, and his correspondents* letters, shows him to be loyal to the British. He is engaged on buying something from Japan but what it is and what is the extent of his pur chases I am not yet in a position to say. ^rom his correspondence it would not appear to be on any big scale. I rather fancy it is some small com- j mercial venture. Alsald is a man of considerable common sens* and honesty of purpose judging from his correspon dence and his personal address. He is, however, very fond of night clubs and c.ancingt waste which he indulges with propriety. He takes great interest in the welfare of his son’s Sultanate and given him and members of his court very sound advice on occasions. Alsald Is shortly leaving again for Japan, chiefly at the request of a Japanese geisha girl who fell in love with him when he was last in Japan and has been urging hir to return to her. {roru.IGN AND PC^jrlaX-DSP Ho. .!&gt; ■m. ^ *riiS ^ ■ 9 !9 7 p^lc/cn J.

Alsald booted a 2nd class passage ticket for Japan by the Italian line, In Bombay and sailed by the 3.5. 'Conte Verde' an 25.3.35 acccrapaniod by a Jeti named Moallia 3aleh Haylm, who also travelled second class. On arrival in Singapore they secretly net Ibrahim Omar iOsagoff or sheikh mhaamed kl sakoff, an aliened Japanese representative In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and it was decided that while they were to continue their journey by the 'Conte Verde', Alsagoff k should teamHmn travel sepja’&amp;tely. He did so arriving in shanghai by the 'Felix Roussel' on 9.4.35 under the name of Mr. A.O. Ibrahim. While Alsald and toallm stayed In the .rabassy Hotel, Alsagoff resided In the Park Hotel. All the three met frequent ly In the libassy Hotel but always in ooraplete secrecy, nothing is known as to what transpired at those meetings. : An Intilan merchant from Japan who came to shan^iai, had business connectlans with Moallm and had been Instructed by his principals in Bombay to advance such funds as Moalim might ask for. At the same tine he t wrote to his agents in Japan at Moallm’s request, instructing than unaer no olgoumsfeaicfig to mention to any Indim or foreigner In Japan the fact that Alsald was visiting that country In the near future. Alsagof: travelling as Ibrahim Omar Alsagoff returned on 20,4.35 to Singapore by the S.b. 'Felix Roussel', while Alsald and Moallm left shanghai for Japan on 10.5.35 in the 5.5. 'Chenoncoanx'. They were to meet alsagoff In .jjjvapore...- 2 - Singapore on their retum journey. Although the cxinver sat Ions vvitri Alsagoff obviously finished before 29th April, Alsaid and Mcalim stayed m in Shanghai because, according to Moalim, 'they were awaiting the arrival of an important letter'. It was suspected at the time that Alsaid’s visit to the Far East might be connected with arms or alternatively that it had a political significance. An Egyptian, paper named Al Balagh contained an » * article in its issue dated 3.9.34 to the effect that the Japanese Government had appointed a representative in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the purpose of promoting Japanese Shipping interests in regard to the pilgrim trade between the Far East and Arabia. It was thought \ possible that Alsaid’s visit to Japan was connected with this mission or with the growing solicitude of the Japanese in attracting to Japan Muslim preceptors from Islamic countries particularly from the Al Azhar University of Cairo. Enquiries in Bombay showed that T.F.T. Alsaid ted been visiting Bombay off and on for the last 4 years. His last visit to Bombay was in the beginning of 1935 prior to his visit to Japan. He was reported to be touring for pleasure and there was no inform tion to show that his visit had a political significance or connected with arms smuggling. He held passport lio. 2003 issued at Muscat on 20.7.31 with visa No.26995 dated 5.2.35 issued by the passport Officer to the Bombay Government. Aalsh H&amp;yim l.oalim is a British subject by naturalisation, of iraqian origin. H® is a Jewish resident of Bombay and has been carrying on...on a cornnission agent's business In Bombay with his brothers for some years past. He holds passport Ho. 926552 dated 4.2.55 issued at Bombay endorsed for China, Japan and India. Following on this, a somewhat cryptic postcard addressed by C. Blanc hi, an Italian confectioner in Shanghai, to S.K. Moualiai, Bombay, seen in secret censorship carae to notice in September 1235, efforts to elucidate it, however, have failed. Alfiaid left Shanghai on his return journey from japan on 7.8.35 by the J. . 'Conteverde' along with Moalim and reached Singipore on 13.8.35 vdiare he disembarked while Mo&amp;lim went straight cm to Bombay. /asaid stated that he intenaed to reside in sln^pore for a year and rented a hou.se in Singapore and at the same time requested the Police not to divulge his incognito. subsequent to this a number of letters from and to T.F.T. iSLsald were seen in c ensorship. They referred among other things, to the despatch of raoney to the extent of 4000 dollars from r.auAllm in Bombay to Alsaid in dingapore. The money is believed to have been paid by the present Sultan of Muscat to loualln to be passed on to his father. It appeared from tto® correspondence that the Sultan of Muscat, his father Sir Sayid Taisur Bin Faisal, the ex-sultan alias T.F.T. Alsaid, ouleh Hayira Moalim who accompanied . Alsaid to Japan and Mr. ohabily, s/o Khan Bahadur A. some others were carrying on business in tea, match ooxes Shabby, Chief Secretary to the sultan of Muscat and etc....etc., and that they wished to keep it secret, hut we have been unable to elucidate some references made in the letters. In a latter to Moalim, *lSBld wanted Moalim to find out the views of the -“ultan (on v/hat ?) send let him mow. In a ias letter from l oalini to Alsaid, koalim refers to a letter received from 'Mr. Tawiq' from Jhanghai and topes they would see him once more. ,.e uo not know vtoo Tawiq is and way Alsaid and Moalim should meet him. In a letter from Alsaid to Mr. Shabily, Alsaid refers to his son the Sultan having written to him that he (the Sultan) wanted to go to Zaffar (or llaffar) this year along with the addressee’s father. The object of this journey is not clear. In another letter Alsaid tells Moalim that he has received Tawiq’s letter in which the writer wishes to see Alsaid, and that he would let him know tow he (T&amp;wif) could see him (Alsaid). In a letter from Moalira to Alaaid, Moalim says that he will send Mr. Alois to Japan for the purchase of the articles and that he will show Alsaid the samples. It is not clear £ what the articles are. The bultan of Muscat arrived in Botabay f rcta Muscat on 7.£.56 stayed in the Majestic Hotel till 25.9.35 and left for Muscat on 25.9.35, by the 5.5, 'Barpeta'. During his stay Moalim saw him frequently and the Sultan purchased quantities of silk and some carpets and took than with him to Muscat. Enquiries in Bushire stowed that the ex-oultan of Muscat and Oman is or used to be quite harmless and only abdicated from the throne of Muscat....Muscat somethree years ago because he dlsHked being In Muscat and also objected to vxjric and responsibility. The Residency in Bushlre had no news about T.F.T. Alsaid's 'mission' to the Far ^ast and surmised his object was to fulfill his fondness for travel and enjoyment. Recently the Bombay police received an anonymous comnainlcatlcn dated 28.11.35. It ms said that -ayed Talmoor bin Faail (T.F.T. Alsaid) the father of H.H. ouyud Bald (the present Sultan) want to Japan with his Secretary talon to make a new political and mercantile arrangement between the Japanese Government and the new Government of bofur, at the request of his son H.H. Bayed Said. When Alsaid returned from Japan, he sent his Secretary to Bombay to give his son who was there from 7.9.35 to 25.9.36 secret information atoout th© inatter.

It will be seen from Colonel Powle t s memorandum j5io.353-s of 1935, dated the 30th April 1935 that the financial position of the Muscat State is generally satisfactory. ihe Government of India are therefore of opinion that there is no justification for any further extension of this subsidy, and they accordingly propose to stop its payment finally from the 1st January 1936. I am to ask for. Secretary of State*s approval to this course. I have the honour to be.

I have been examining the matter since and feel doubtful whether a good case can be put up. 3 . Taking first the financial side. The following are the figures of the revenue and expenditure of the Muscat State for the past four years. Revenue. Expenditure. 1931 RS • 749,530. Rs. 706,695. 1932 tt 712,285.

It is true the State is now just ticking over and that the result has been brought about by the most stringent economy and the cutting down to the bone of the social and humanitarian services of the State, a sum ol Rs .80,000/- is however being expended on such services during the current year (vide correspondence ending with Foreign and Political Department telegram No.623, dated the 10th March 1935). Again, the last instalment 01 the Government of India loan was repaid in March 1933 and all debts to British / The Hon 1 hie „ _ „ u n Mr.H.A.F .Metcalfe,C*S .1. ,C*I•£• , C/o The India Office, London•e&gt; - 2 - British subjects have been cleared. 4 . 7 /e could of course make it one of the conditions the continuance of the Subsidy that the Sultan should raise the pay of the Levy Corps in order to get a better class 01 recruit but a rise of say Rs.5/-, which should be adequate, in the basic pay of the rank and file would only come to some Rs.9000/- a year. This is of course considerably less than the Subsidy and I am afraid that on this point Finance might say that the Muscat Government should raise it themselves. 5 . On the political side, the continuance of the Subsidy would doubtless ensure that the Sultan would turn to us more readily for advice. This, however, he undertook, on his coming to the Throne, to do. Moreove^his dependence on us is such that he cannot but turn to us for assistance in any matter of serious import to him, and irrespective of whether we continue the Subsidy or not we shall find it necessary in our own interests to support him (if necessary by armed force) as we did at Khassab in 1930 and Sur in 1932. It must also be remembered that he will continue to receive from us the Zanzibar Subsidy. 6 . Both on financial and political grounds therefore I am afraid that it is difficult to put up a convincing case which will pass Finance. I should however like to discuss the matter with you when we meet - as we doubtless shall - in London. ■»/VvDate. Initials. To Under Secretary j /3„ 3/ // t Secretary of State...

It has occurred to me tiiat the subsidy would be best spent towards these ends if Government accorap nied its payment to the sultan with deiinite conditions as to its expenditure, and since the continuance of the nrms Subsidy is entirely ex gratia , there would be no objections either from the Government or His Highness*s point Cl- of / (Signature) S. 4fc LiH DCFP—1124S&amp;P—(M-1314)—T*8-92&gt;~J2|000.

Government would expect that in the expenditure of the whole grant the i olitical Agent would be consulted by His Highness. 6 . The advantages of this scheme are obvious. It ensures that the money is properly spent and not frittered away, and the social services undertaken by means of this Government grant should have an excellent effect in our favour on public opinion* The proviso under clause 3 (c) ensures that we have some control over Muscat education, which /s which is most important. tr.

The subsidy would normally have come to an end with the aCQ e ®^i° n the Sultan on the 10th February 1932, but it was decided in 1932 to extend it for a further period of three years, up to February 1935, in view of the precarious financial position of the Muscat State. During the last three years the State has made strenuous efforts to put its financial house in order. These efforts have met with a considerable degree of success, but the improvement in the position has only been obtained by pursuing a policy of the most stringent economy. The Civil List (which here, as in other Arab States^is the largest single item on the expenditure side of the Budget) has been cut, and this has inevitably caused a certain amount of discontent among the Sultan’s relations; Muscat’s only school has had to be closed down and social services are now practically non-existent; the pay of the Levy Corps has been seriously cut down, the basic pay of the Sepoy having been further reduced from 25 to 20 rupees per mensem in 1932, following on a previous reduction from Rs. 30 to Rs. 2f in 1931, and this has resulted in a serious decline in the discipline and efficiency of the Corps^ finally it may be mentioned that sanitary conditions in Muscat are described as deplorable, and this 1 2956 6000 7/94 is mainly to be attributed to the lack of the necessary funds for maintaining an efficient sanitary service. In spite of these drastic economies it will be seen from the comparative figures of revenue and expenditure for the years 1932—33 and 1933-34 furnished by the Political Resident and enclosed in the Government of India's letter ol/ *S J^ of the 10th November^that without the assistance of the Arms Traffic Subsidy, the Muscat Budget could have been balanced, only in 1933 and not in 1932 or 1934. Tfi/hile on deputation in this country in April 1933 the Political Resident recorded a note which will be found at flag H, representing that the Muscat Administration had been cut down to the bone, and expressing himself strongly in favour of retaining the Arms Traffic Subsidy for a further short period of say two years beyond the date on which it is at present due to expire (10th February 1935) . Colonel Fowle suggested that he might wait for a few months longer before putting forward official proposals to the Government of India for the further extension of the subsidy. 3. In the Spring of this year the Sultan enquired whether there was any hope of the subsidy being continuec. until December 1935, the close of the Muscat financial year, whereupon the Resident addressed the Government of India in his letter of the 29th May (enclosed in the Government of India’s letter of 10th November) recommending that the subsidy should be extended for one full year, i.e. until February 1936. The Government of India now propose to continue paying the subsidy up to the end of December 1935 only ’’pending further examination of the issues involved”. . It appears from this that their present intention is to make a payment to the Sultan of^Rs. 90,000, and not to pay a full annual instalment of the subsidy, though this is not quite clear. Prima facie there seems to be a case for granting a somewhat more generous extension of the subsidy, but there is perhaps a good deal to oe said for waiting to see how the Muscat financial situation develops next year before deciding to extend the subsidy further. It may be noted in this connection that /3. Minute Paper. political Department. that if the actual figures for revenue collected in 1933 (at flag A) are compared with the Budget estimates (at flag B) the actual revenue for 1933 is seen to have exceeded the Budget estimates by almost Rs. 100,000. It is just possible, though perhaps unlikely, that a similar buoyancy in. the revenue during 1935 might make a further extension of the subsidy beyond December 1935 unnecessary. It may be mentioned that we have not as yet received the usual detailed statement showing actual revenue and expenditure during 1933, but this is no doubt due to the absence of a Financial Adviser at Muscat. Captain Alban's time at Muscat as Financial Adviser expired last summer, and we have not yet heard of the appointment of a successor. In the circumstances explained above it is submitted that the Secretary of State’s approval may be given to the G-overnment of India’s proposal to extend the Arms 2956 6000 7/34 X U UZL kW* utOLfJ&lt;bL.

OAlf,Oonfiden tial From Die Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office London Dated New Delhi, the November 1934 Muscat subsidy of Hs» 1,00,00 0/- per annum Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with the paper forwarded with my weekly letter No «44-M d ated the 23rd March 1933, I am directed to forward copies of the *Letter from the Hon*die the political Besident communications in the Persian Gulf,No•486-S of 1934,dated the 29th May 1934. noted in the Letter to -do- No.D.2774-N/34, dated the 16th July 1934. I margin. Die Letter from -do- No.763-3 of 1934,dated the 7th| have carefully considered the request of the Sultan of Muscat that the period, during which the amount of the Arms Traffic subsidy (Bs. 1,00,000/- per annum) is to be paid and which expires on the 10th February 1935, may be extended up to the end of December 1935. It will be seen from th r ' comparative statement showing the main heads of Muscat State budgets for revenue and expenditure during 1932, 1933 and 1934, that without the amount of Bs.1,00,000 the budget could have been balanced only in 1933 and not in 1932 and 1934. This result was however only attained (a) by heavy reduction in the Civil list with consequent great discontent among the cadets of the Sultan's family, (b) by closing down all beneficent activities including the State's only school, and (c) by a reduction in the pay Muscat, to be a grave cause of discontent and to have rendered the Corps inefficient. The State still owes to Government of Indis of the Levy Corps which is reported by the political Agent, merchantsmerchants debts amouriting to about; Rs»90,000&gt; ^ payment of the amount in question is stopped on the 10th February 1935, it is evident that the State will be face to face once more with grave financial difficulties, and is likely to be unable either to pay off debts or to balance its budget. 2. In the present state of political development in the Persian Gulf, and having regard to the fact that Muscat, with its dependency Gwadur, supplies an essential link in inter-imperial air communications, and is a State the good will of which must be retained if control over arms-traffic in this region is to be adequately secured, the Government of India have decided that, pending further examination of the issues involved, it is desirable to extend the period of the payment of the Arms Traffic Subsidy up to the end of December 1935 as requested by the Sultan. 5. I am to ask for the Secretary of State*s approval to this course. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Foreign Secretary to the Government of Inal a*J CONFIDENTIAL. (1) Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 486-S of 1934, dated the 29th May 1934. I have the honour to state that during one of the conversations which Major Bremner and I had with His Highness the Sultan during my present visit to Muscat, His Highness enquired whether there would be any hopes of the Arms Subsidy, wnich expires on the 10th February 1935, being conti nued until December 1935—the close of the Muscat financial year. As you are aware, vide correspondence ending with Government of India Express Letter No. F. 161-N/32 of 30th June 1932, there has already been an extension of the Arms Subsidy for a period of three years. His Highness said that he was very grateful to the Government of India for the previous sanction and felt some diffidence at asking for a further one. 2. He pointed out, which is quite correct, that the economies which he had effected during the last three years, and which, with the assistance of the continuance of the Arms Subsidy, have saved the State from Bankruptcy (the total balance in the Muscat Treasury from all sources at the end of 1933 was Rs. 165,737-11-0) have only been effected by cutting down the humanitarian services of the State to the bone. He pointed out that the State s one school which he himself had started in 1928 had had to be abolished in 1932 as part of his economy campa’gn. He went on to say that the sanitary conditions of i both Muscat and Muttrah were, in the absence of a proper Municipality and I Hygiene Service, deplorable. He stated that if the Subsidy were granted for &gt; another year, he would be only too wiling to ear-mark the amount entirely to such social services as well as paying off the debts which the State owes to merchants etc. amounting to about Rs. 90,000. 3. Prim'i facie it might appear that the balance of Rs. 165,737 in a snail State was a s'gn of settled prosperity. It must be remembered, however, that, unlike Ba irain for instance, Muscat has * no reserve whatever and the debts mentioned above have to be met. Moreover the Political .Agent, Muscat, in a recent report, referring to the credit balance on the working of the year 1933 wrote :— “ Thovgh there are undoubtedly signs of a slight revival in trade and merchants are, generally speaking, less pessimistic the above surplus balance can in no way be taken as a safe indication that the crisis is past. The fact has been lost sight of that whilst the local price of dates remained fairly high, the slump on the Bombay market later in the season in the price of Bishr dates, i.e. the inferior quality which is the staple export of theBatinah, will react most unfavourably on the population of that area who are already reduced to a state of penurious beggary. If the German market for Kasha is closed permanently it will undoubtedly have a most adverse effect locally till other adequate markets are found.” 4. Like His Highness I feel considerable diffidence in once more approach ing the Government of India for a further sanction. Both Major Bremner and I, however, are of opinion that there is much in what His Highness says. It was most regrettable that Muscat’s one school, which held more than 100 boys, and which was in a flourishing condition, had to be shut down, and its closing led to some criticism in the Arab Press—vide my letter No. 65-S of 20th January 1933 to you (F. No. 52-N/33). The sanitary and social condi tions of Muscat are certainly very bad, and I was much struck by them after mv experiences of the far cleaner conditions of Kuwait and Bahrain. The pavment of the debts to merchants, too, would enable the State at the end of 1933 to start afresh. If the Subsidy is continued I recommend that it be l\J for the period of a full year, i.e., until February 1936. The merchants are, ' I understand, willing to accept a reduction of 25 per cent, of their claims, 354(C) F&amp;P Jwhich would bring down the total under this head to about Rs. 76,500 thus leaving from the Subsidy for the initiation of Educational, Municipal and Hygiene services, the sum of Rs. 32,500 which should set such services on a firm basis. 5. In conclusion I trust that the Government of India will see their way to giving the Sultan’s request their favourable and sympathetic consideration.

No. (1)] I am directed to request that to enable a proper appreciation to be made of the latest information regarding the financial position and prospects of Muscat the Muscat State budget for 1934 may be forwarded to the Government of India at an early date. 2.

Cn a matter of procedure it would no aoubt be preferable that the approach to the Government of India should be made by the Resident rather than by the Secretary of State. The Resident &lt;&amp;ould repeat his proposals to us and might mention that the question had been discussed during his deputation here. The Government of India could be relied on in those circumstances to give the Secretary of State an ortunity of commenting before a decision was taken. Usx. tv-7 h A, ^4 .iv.?3Colonel Fowle, Muscat. Arms Traffic Subsidy . The subsidy under present arrangements is due to expire in 1935. The financial condition of the State seems from the latest papers received to be improving. On the other hand the economies which have been imposed are very severe and have apparently given rise to adverse comment locally. And on general grounds it is difficult to defend for any long period the reduction in educational facilities which it has been necessary to impose. 2. It would be of great assistance if you would be so kind as to let us have your views as to the desirability or otherwise of retaining the arms traffic subsidy for a short further period, if conditions seem to justify that course when the date of its expiry is nearer; so that they could be on record if and when the question came up for consideration. If you were in favour of a further extention you would, how r ever, presumably think it undesirable that we should give any hint to this effect to the Sultan or possibly even to the P.A.

I am very strongly in favour of the Arms Traffic Subsidy being retained for a further short period, say for 2 years, beyond the date, April 1935, on which it expires. The administration h s been cut down to the bone, and even perhaps to the marrowi , and such essentials as education havehave had to he eliminated altogether: the only school in the States, (the Government one at Muscat), having n^d to he closed. This has caused criticisms in the Arab Press, vide mjr letter of 20th January to Mr .Metcalfe, and owing to our special relations with Muscat Sta^e we have to oe&gt;,x some of the resulting odium. As you point oj. t i - woulc, oc false economy to risk a financial collapse, if tne risk can he reduced hy a short further extension of the subsidy, which would involve only a comparatively light expenditure. I think perhaps it would be best if an approach to the Government of India on the subject of an extension of the subsidy were postponed until say tne end of tne year, whe.. we will be able to see how the State then stands financially. If Government were approached now it is probable that they would reply “wait and see'*. By the way I have held out no hopes either to the Sultan or Captain Alban, or to Major Bremner, that the subsidy may be extended. 21.4.33.INDIA OFFICE. political department.

But in order to prevent State from falling into complete financial chaos we propose continuing payment of amount hitherto paid (Rs.l,00,000/- per annum) for a period of three years as suggested by Resident. We are however of opinion that continuance of this subsidy, whether now or on expiry of this period is merely a question of expediency and we suggest that it should be made clear to new Sultan and State Council that further extension cannot be counted on and that consequently during next three years finances of State must be so organised that it will be able to meet loss of subsidy at close of period. Issue of the above has been authorised. (Sgd.) H. A. P. Metcalfe. Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.Notes. Minute Paper. Register No. P* Z. 1238/32. SECRET.

Previous papers 2730 1000 4.34 FOR INFORMATION. It will he remembered that the question of the renewal of the subsidies to the new Sultan has not yet been discussed, but an advance copy of Colonel Biscoe* s despatch to the Government of India is now submitted. (a) The Zanzibar Subsidy of Rs.86,400 per annum. It has always been the view in recent years that this subsidy was absolute and paragraphs 3-4 reiterate this view. It is subject only to the Sultan’s ’’living in terms of amity and friendship with His Majesty’s Government and fulfilling his treaty engagements”. (b) The Arms Traffic Subsidy of Re.l lakh. The Government of India have promised to consult us before taking a decision (P.Z.7077/31). This subsidy is now, strictly speaking, an anachronism, and was only granted to Sultan Taimur and his predecessor for the duration of their rule. The former/former received a clear warning in February 1923 that it would cease when his rule terminated. The Government of India remarked in their letter of the 14th April 1921 to the Political Resident (P*4180/2l) that it seemed open to the Government of India 'to reconsider the position and to treat the question of withdrawal or curtailment as one of expediency in the light of the circumstances then prevailing'. Colonel Biscoe now suggests that the financial situation of the State requires its renewal for at least three years, with the possibility of a further extension of two years. A study of the budget figures for 1932 confirms this and it seems probable that the Government of India, hard up though tye themselves are, will support his recommendation. The estimated receipts are about 7 lakhs: to take away 1 lakh, just when Saiyid Said and Captain Alban have put the State finances on the road to stability would be disastrous. It will be observed that not only did the actuals for 1931 balance, as anticipated in the papers submitted at P.Z.5848/31 (on attached file), but there was a surplus of about Rs.30,000 to be devoted to repayment of the Government of India loan: x it seems probable, however, that this represents the repayment of Rs.43,000 to the Government of India included in the budget estimate for 1931 (page 5 of P.Z.5848/31) - so that, in effect, the actuals fall short of the estimates by Rs.13,000. There remain about 2 lakhs of debts altogether, including the whole debt to the Government of India. The 1932 estimate shows a surplus of Rs.1,800 without including the increased customs revenue which it is hoped to gain from the action at Sur and the revision of the Commercial Treaty. There is apparently the possibility of yet another cut in the pay of the Levy Corps, but this has not been included in the Budget. x (this seems to be borne out by para.7 on page 2 of P.Z. 5848/31). In/Minute Paper, Political © Department. In these circumstances it would certainly seem advisable not to cripple Captain Alban in the completion of his excellent work by the withdrawal of l/7th of the receipts. The time for its withdrawal is when in a few years the State has become completely self-supporting. The present expense would be amply repaid by the influence it would give us with a firmly seated Ruler. A.F.Morley 2.3.32. It should be noted that the estimated surplus of Rs.1,800 is irrespective of the 2 lakhs of outstanding debt. It is hoped to pay off about Rs.74,000 of this debt in 1932-3 (and the remainder in 1933-4). The State is therefore banking on a surplus of over Rs.70,000 over the estimated receipts. This makes it even more obvious that it would be a mistake at this stage to withdraw the Arms Subsidy. M. J.Clauson Financial Department . For information or any observation. M. J.Clauson 7.3. This appears,on the whole, to be quite a satisfactory budget. Some items of expenditure,however could be still further reduced - particularly that under the head 'Pensions”. In view of the opinion expressed by Major Fowle in para.4 of his memorandum that the anticipated receipts appear, on the whole, to be based on a conservative estimate, a surplus of about Rs.74,000 2621 6000 3/34 with which to reduce debts may not be unlikely. It seems certain/certain,however, that the withdrawal of the Arms Subsidy would cause a deficit, but I do not think it would be unreasonable of the Government of India to recommend its reduction. Perhaps it could be annually reduced on a sliding scale until it is finally withdrawn in 3 or 4 years time. D.M.C. 12.3. The 'Zanzibar' subsidy has a curious history. It is perhaps a little surprising that the Government of India should feel justified in continuing to pay it. But I think we might let this sleeping dog lie. F.E.Grist. 14.3. I do not think we are in a position here to say that the 'Pensions' payments could be reduced, at any rate for the present. One has to remember that the Sultan is not yet firm on the throne, and to keep loyal followers loyal is worth a little extra expense. As to the Arms Subsidy, it is so impossible to foresee the future ^ whether Muscat settles down comfortably under Saiyid Said, whether the increase of customs dues comes into being and is effective, whether trade is buoyant,etc. - that the Govt.of India may not wish to commit themselves beyond one,or two years. The 'Zanzibar 1 subsidy, tho’ its history is curious, appears to be in effect a definite commitment and one that the Government of India cannot evade.

In 1921 hc^irer in considering the question of the reduction of the Arm Traffic subsidy* the ’olitieal Agent* ^uscat* expressed the view that the Zanzibar subsidy was, subject to certain not very clear conditions, the right of any Sultan recognised by the British £overaiaent - a view which was concurred in by the Resident, vide Bushlre letter tfo*138-S of 13th June 1921, and it may be aaauifed that the Government of India also concurred as they instructed the lies! dent to explain to the Sultan the to mss of both the Sansibar and the Anas Traffic subsidy - vid © their a^oronauift ?to«1543~ &lt;*A», dated 29th December 1921* Whether any oosmauxiication was piade to the Sultan at the time i:y records do not show, but presumably soae verbal Intimation at my rate was given to His Highness, since in his letter lib*32*0, dated 22nd September* which formed an enclosure to Bus hire letter Ho*790*8 of 2^nd October 1* 2, the Political Aftmt reported that the Sul tan had aiscuesed with him the natuuw of the Arms Traffic subsidy, Ho further reference how ver ie road© in any carreo on donee of the Zanzibar subsidy and X thinh it will be seen from tiie above brief suEta&amp;ry of the history of this subsidy that the Government of India have accepted the view that it is an absolute subsidy grasn ted to the Sultan of J tiaent subject only to hia living in term of amity andfriendship with ilia Majesty 4 a Government and fulfilling his treaty engagements. 5 * The Araas Traffic subsidy is however on a totally different basis* It was originally grai ted to 3 niyid Taimacr in 1912 in return for m undertaking on his part/part to establish a bonded wa ©house In which arms and anmnnltlon mould b deposited on Inportatlozw on the death of Saiyld Faisal the following year it was decided to continue the subsidy to Saiyid Talsmr on certain conditions, but f as explained above, stme confusion arose owing to the two nubaidles having been treated as though they were on the same basis, altliotigh one was e permanent subsidy ana tim other u personal one. 6 .

For 1932 reductions have been made in the allowances of the Hoyal Family of Ptf, $$ and according to salary.

The Budget for 1932 will be affected by various factors on which it is impossible to prophesy (lara 3)* On the Receipte side the most important Individual item is the Arms subsidy* he receipts generally, as far as I can Judge, seemto be based on a conservative estimate (para 4)* The total expenditure for 1931 will be about Re*706 # 660. This ificludes various cute which were made in the course of the year-. The expenditure for 1932 i« estimated to be Ks.676,300 (deducting the debts) i.e. reduction of Kis.29,360, which has been effected by various further cute in pay all round. The most important item from our point of view is &amp;o*6, Defence (Muscat Infantry), and the point has to be settled whether the basic pay should be further reduced at K®.*0 p*m. (para 9). Some of the items, (for instance l*o*13 - yens leas - Which as far as I can make out is restricted to members of th£ Al du aid tribe, i*o* the one to which the Royal Family belongs) may appear abnormal from a western point of view* But we are not dealing with a part of British India, we are not even dealing with an Indian estate, our concern is with an independent Arabian Dultanate whose stability for various reasons, political and strategical, is important to us, but in whose afdaire we want to interfere as little as possible, provided that this stability is assured. This being so, subject to aim' remarks that captain Alban, the new Financial Adviser, hasto mafco. I think &gt;• may give the Budget, which eeeme to be the beet possible under present oircumetanoee, and whioh refleots credit on falyid Said and hie Aoocuntant-aeueral, oar approval.

The principal correspondents are officials at the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Government of India (Foreign and Political Department), India Office, Foreign Office, and the Political Agency in Muscat. The papers deal with the question of the renewal of the Arms Traffic Subsidy at various times:In February 1932, when Said bin Taimur [Sa‘īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] succeeded his father as Sultan (this is also when the payment of the Zanzibar Subsidy was questioned)At the beginning 1935 when a three year extension was due to lapseAt the end of 1935 when it was decided to discontinue the subsidyIn November 1937 after the Sultan had requested the subsidy to be restoredIn 1939-45 when the payment of a War Subsidy was also considered.Also contained within the file is correspondence discussing the right of the Sultan to import arms following the end of the Arms Traffic Subsidy and the question over the likelihood he might do so. Connected to this are communications from the Intelligence Bureau concerning suspicion over the activities of the Sultan's father in Japan (folios 128-30, 132-42).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Subsidies</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000214#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
