Monsieur Davaz says that he even has great difficulty in securing permission for the return to this country of Turkish women and children who have gone to iurkey ior a summer holiday and now wish to rejoin their husbands: the Iranian authorities dela^r oheir decision lor weeks, though an Iranian subject wishing to go to Turkey is able, the Ambassador declares to secure a visa for Turkey on the day of his application, dut it is chiefly in regard to the execution of the Turco- Persian frontier done Convention of 1937 that Monsieur Lavaz finds the Iranian Government most difficult. He says that the Iranian frontier authorities are never willing to attend the periodical meetings provided for in Article V of the Convention, and that in spite of the terms ol Article Xv they allow all their undesirables to remain near the frontier. 2. The Iranians may have a different version of the frontier question, but It is of interest that in matters which should be less difficult to deal with, the Turkish representative seems to find the same delay and ill-will that beset the path of this Legation.

Dear Department, With reference to paragraph 5(a) of our despatch No. 229 of the 19th June, 1937, and to the reprint from the Geographical Journal enclosed with Foreign Office despatch No. 48 of the 12th February last, (L 583/122/405), we enclose a copy of a note on the Turco-Iranian frontier rectification of May, 1937, written by Finch, who, as you know, resided in Kurdistan, not far south of the area in question, before coming here. 2. The rectification is very trivial, but the theory here offered directly traverses that of our previous despatch under reference, and, if it is correct, throws an interesting light on the careless ness of some of the work of 1932. 3. We are sending copies of this letter to the Department of External Affairs, New Delhi, and to the Embassy at Ankara. Yours ever, Chancery. The Eastern Department, Foreign Office.

The following seems to me the only explanation which will make sense of the two texts recited in Article i of the Accord of $ay, Map (ii) above, though it lails to bring out the full title of the village (a), which should be Bair Marbiahu (the monastery of Marbiahu), has the correct topography in all (i) Eastern Turkey in Asia, aheet 27 (Ur ia-julsinerk)■■■■Pi MHMMi © all cases (a) to (d). Jap (i) obviously also derives from the Identic Map which is the original of (ii), as shown by the absence of conflict in the fewer details that its smaller scale gives, and the reappearance, not only of the inflected form 'Deri', but of other forms of names in the surrounding villages, especially confirmatory being the reappearance of mistakes (e. g. Baki for Bani). ft ap (iii) has sloughed off the ’’Deri” for the more exact Deir Marbishu, but contains an error in putting a second 'Marbishu' further east, which is in reality a confusion with the Mar T &lt;)lena of the Identic Map. This error owes its origin to the authoritative map produced between the dates of ( ii) and (iii), - and, in fact, acknowledged as a source in the margin of (iii) - , namely, the series published with the Receuil des ^roces-Yerbaux of 1914, (and without a copy of which I unfortunately write this note), whereon, unless my assumption in the first sentence of paragraph 4 above is wrong, '’ITazbicho* appears either in the position of Avki or Mar Elena, in any case east of the river junction. A mistake was made in the name, and a mistake may also have been made in the position: not of any consequence in 1914, for the Commissioners of that year drew the frontier several miles further east, and were not vitally concerned with the exact position (or name) of Marbishu. On ’’the 1914 survey” the drafters of 1932, as would be reasonable, worked, and wrote ”la ligne descend vers le Sud jusqu’a ce confluent, puis elle suit le thalweg du Berdereehe Tchay Les localites d’Eli et de 'aqui restent a la Turquie, celle de Mazbicho a la Perse The reappearance of the incorrect 'Mazbicho” strengthens this suggestion. Then it was discovered that Marbishu lies (a) west ofoi the confluence, ^h) astride the Pagi stream, and that the above maxes nonsense. Bo the area is examined on the spot, the mountain north of the confluence (...'sommet qui se trouve a 2400 metres au Ford du confluent',... 1932 text) is surveyed for altitude, given its name, and provided with a boundary pillar ( ‘sommet de Papei Pochap, cote 2800, ou se trouve posee la borne o. 476 •••• 1937 text'), and the wording is circumstantially corrected. ’De Tape! Hochap eile descend en ligne droite jusqu*a la riviere venant de Paqui pour rejoindre cette derniere au point (b; .... situe approximativement a 50 metres au Nord-Ouest de Wazbicho et de ce point elle suit le thalweg de la dite riviere .jusqu’a son confluent avec la riviere Berdereche Tchay. Puis elle suit le thalweg du Berdereehe Tchay Lee localitee d’Eli et de Paqui reetent a la Turquie et la partie de la localite de Mazbicho situ^e a 1’Kst de la riviere venant de Paqui a I'lnan”. Assuming the topography of map (ii), this appears to me to make complete sense. It still does not explain the continuance of the word ’ azbicho', I admit; but that may be either one of the frequent misprints in the Journal de Teheran, whence we have copied our text, or it may be a slip that those responsible for the Accord of 1937 have yet to detect. 6. Other variations (according to the Journal de Teheran’s text) between the drafts of 1932 and 1937 are:- (1) alteration of '300 metres' 1 to ”800 metres’ in the passage dealing with the Bkmalouk Chai. This may be a re-survey, or a misprint. (2) the naming and description of ”fapei Hochap” mentioned above. Pap (ii) shows a fort near the position in question marked ”Kalat-i-Khavls-Abi', and map (i) has 'Kale Xhavieabi'. 'Tapei” is, needless to say, the word more commonly transliterated in English 'Teppeh” (hill). The parallel 'Hochap ! and 'Khavis-abi” makes it pretty certain this is the Kurdish that is commonlycommonly rendered in ’nglieh ’’khush-ab” (good water), for the variants ’khueh ! and M kh(w) ieh’* are, I think, known to Kurdish in the same way as to Persian. It is just possible, this being the area that was the habitat of the Marbishu tribe of Assyrians until 1918, that the real word is 'Khoshaba', a common Assyrian proper name. 7. I attach a sketch map to make the foregoing easier to follow. (Intld. ) J. &gt;.G.F. -W3British labatisy.

[E 3687/1117/34] Copy No. H5 (No. 229.) Sir, Mi‘. Seymour to Mr. Eden.—{Received July 5.) Tehran, June 19, 1937. WITH reference to my despatch No . 154 o f the 23rd April, I have the honour to enclose the text of the ten treaties, conventions and agreements enumerated in the communique which formed the enclosure to that despatch^ 1 ) These texts, as will be seen, have been appearing in rather amorphous instalments in the Journal de Teheran. They were submitted to the Majlis for ratification on the 16th May and duly ratified on the 5th June. 2. It has not yet been possible to give complete examination here to all these documents. They would seem, however, to bear out the view already expressed that they do not amount to very much or to be commensurate with the months and the labour devoted to their consummation. They seem also to bear out the various comments made to me on some of them by M. Husnu, head of the Turkish delegation, and recorded in my despatch under reference. The Agreement on Traffic and Transport from Trebizond via Tabriz to Tehran, in addition to dealing with road improvement, provides for the supply of a sufficiency of transport, and for simplification of customs and other formalities. As regards the Convention on Air Navigation, the nearest approach to anything concrete is contained in article 17, which provides that at latest within three months of the coming into force of the convention, a committee will specify the air custom houses, intermediary and terminal aerodromes, and the itineraries to be adopted. 3. The special agreement on telegraphs and telephones provides for the duplication of the telegraph line between Maku and Bayazit this year, and for joining up the Iranian system with the Turkish line between Katur and Van. The two countries’ telephone systems are to be linked up by the end of 1939 at latest. There is also a rather obscure article (article 5) which provides for mutual preferential treatment as regards the transmission of wireless telegrams in certain circumstances. 4. The two conventions on frontier security and extradition may be of special interest to the Government of India. The former is described as taking the place of the 1929 convention. A zone is laid down 100 kilom. wide—50 on each side of the frontier. Incidents arising in this zone are to be dealt with by major or minor officials, according to their importance. The major officials are designated by the Turks and Iranians respectively as “ Vali ” and “ Commissar.’' The minor ones are styled “ Kaimakam ” and “Assistant Commissar.’’ The major officials are to meet bi-annually, and the minor, bi-monthly, or urgently at any time at the request of either side. They are empowered to fix the scale of indemnities. They must produce bi-lingual records of all evidence taken. On application by one party the other party will afford necessary permits (available for the occasion only) for a visit to any locality in the zone for the purpose of collecting evidence. 5. The Extradition Treaty does not appear to contain any specially novel feature. Extradition can only be asked for in respect of persons who, if found guilty, would receive a minimum sentence of one year’s imprisonment. Political offenders are not liable to extradition, hut the following offences are not to be considered political:— (i) Offences against the head of the State or his family. (ii) Offences against the head of the Government. (iii) All offences liable exclusively to the jurisdiction of a military tribunal. 6. In addition to the documents already enumerated, I enclose the text of an agreement relating to a rectification of the 1932 frontier line between the two ( 1 ) Not printed with the exception of “Accord relatif a la rectification de la ligne frontiere entre I’lran et la Turquie ” printed as July 5, Section 6. [64 e—5]2 countries. This was signed on behalf of Turkey by the Turkish Ambassador on the 26th May and ratified by the Majlis on the 10th June. The rectifications which are in the neighbourhood of Marbisha, seem to be insignificant and apparently in favour of Turkey. 7. In conclusion, 1 would draw attention to the fact that the attempts to conclude a consular convention referred to in the third paragraph of my earlier despatch No. 38 o f the 26th January, have not yet reached a conclusion. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosures to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora and to the Government of India, No. 104 (conventions on frontier security and extradition only).

[E 2366/1117/34] Copy No, Mr. Seymour to Mr. Eden.—(Received May 10.) (No. 154.) Sir, Tehran, Afril 23, 1937. WITH reference to my despatch No. ISljifLfhe 9th April, I have the honour to report that M. Cemal Husnu, the head of the Turkish special mission, on the 22nd April signed a commercial agreement between Turkey and Iran, thus, at long last, reaching the end of his mission. 2. M. Husnu lunched with me after the signature, and showed me an advance copy of the joint communique, which has since been issued and copies of which I enclose. He was also good enough to show me a copy of the commercial agreement, the signature of which had been in doubt practically up to the last moment. It hardly seems of a nature to cause such hesitations, as it really only amounts to a mutual agreement for most-favoured-nation treatment. The Turkish Government had desired that the commercial treaty should be accompanied by a clearing agreement; but the Iranian Government were reluctant to commit themselves to any more such agreements at present—a policy which, in view of their present difficulties, seems wise. 3. As regards the agreement for air services between Turkey and Iran, M. Husnu told me that it had not been possible for his mission to reach an agreement on the route to be followed; this will be left to be dealt with by experts at a later date. 4. The two countries have agreed that their railway systems shall be connected and that road communications shall be improved. As regards a railway connexion, this is obviously not a practical proposal for the moment. The Trans- Iranian line must be finished and provided with rolling-stock before the Tehran- Tabriz line can be undertaken, and it is far from clear how the whole programme is to be financed. 5. The agreements relating to frontier questions will, M. Husnu hopes, be useful in providing a means of settlement for numerous petty incidents. It is proposed, I understand, to establish some sort of local joint commission which will hold regular meetings for the settlement of such cases. 6. The remaining agreements are, as I understand, in the forms commonly adopted for such agreements. Under the establishment convention, Turkish citizens will apparently obtain greater facilities for the acquisition of real property in this country than are, in the absence of a special agreement, accorded to foreigners under Iranian law. 7. I would ask that the information given me by M. Husnu about these treaties may be regarded as strictly confidential until such time as they are published. 8.

According to an announcement in the Journal de Teheran of the 16th March, these conventions dealt with the following subjects :— (a) Frontier security. (h) Extradition. (c) Judicial assistance.

Copy No. J 1 G Mr. Seymour to Mr. Eden.—(Received February 22.) (No. 38.) Sir, Tehran, January 26, 1937. WITH reference to my despatch No. 433 E. of the 19th September last, 1 have the honour to report that M. Cemal Husnu, the head of the Turkish mission which arrived in Iran in October last, is still in Tehran but expects to finish his negotiations shortly. 2. From what M. Husnu has told me it seems that the negotiations have not led to any very important results. A commercial agreement will, I understand, be concluded, but there have been a good many difficulties over it and it is not likely to have any remarkable effects. The Turkish delegation have naturally found it difficult to achieve much when the Iranian Government are already so committed, as regards their international trade, by their agreements with Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Nor does there seem much scope, even if this difficulty were removed, for increasing the trade between Turkey and Iran. 3. Attempts have been made to negotiate a consular convention, but this will almost certainly have to be left for the Turkish Embassy to deal with after the mission’s departure. It has not yet been possible for the Turkish representatives to overcome the reluctance of the Iranian Government to agree to the inclusion of the whole country in consular districts. The reluctance of the Iranian Government to accept proposals of this kind is already well known to your Department. 4. M. Husnu has taken a great personal interest in the promotion of a civil air service between Angora and Tehran. His instructions were to propose | a fully reciprocal Turco-Iranian service. Unfortunately, however, the General Staffs'of both countries considered that flying by Turkish pilots to Tehran, or by Iranian pilots to Angora, would give too great facilities for espionage. The present proposal is therefore, I believe, that the Turks should fly only to Tabriz, and the Iranians to a point at some distance from Angora. The final stage in each case would be flown only by national pilots. 5. Agreements for the improvement of ground communications between the two countries, the settlement of frontier difficulties and similar matters have, M. Husnu informs me, been successfully negotiated 6. From a political point of view the prolonged visit of the Turkish mission must be regarded as a success. M. Husnu was, I think, an excellent selection for this task. He has been a very patient negotiator, and has accepted with good humour the Iranian habit of reopening questions which the other side had supposed to be finally settled. He has also entered with zest into such social distraction as Tehran affords and has, I think, made a very good impression generally. 7.

Mr. BUTLER was good enough to send me a copy of his despatch No. 151 of the 28t h March on the subject of relations between Turkey and Iran. 2. The facilities given to the Turkish military attache in Tehran are probably in the nature of a return for the similar and very wide facilities given to the Shah during his State visit to Turkey in 1934, and to which attention was drawn by my despatc h No. 329 of the 7th J u ly, 1934 . 3. I share Mr. Butler’s opinion~TEat^we have no reason to grudge Turkey the position she has won for herself in Iran. The removal, for the time being at all events, of the ancient grievances that caused so much ill-feeling between the two neighbouring countries in former days seems to me a definite asset for peace in this part of Asia and thenceforth an asset for British policy. There are no grounds here for supposing that Turkey has abused the position she has gained in Iran, and there appear from Mr. Butler’s despatch to be none perceptible in Tehran, where they would presumably be more noticeable. On the other hand there is evidence that Turkish influence in Iran has been used in a moderating and conciliatory sense, especially as regards Irano-lraqi relations and difficulties, and that Turkey has held in careful regard and respect British interests in those regions. 4.

April 27, 1936. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. ^[E 2296/356/34] Copy No. Mr. Butler to Mr. Eden.—(Received April 27.) (No. 151.) Sir, Tehran, March 28, 1936. IN the annual report for 1935 a reference was made to Turkey as having retained her position as Iran’s best friend, and in his despatch No. .33 of the 18th January last His Majesty’s Minister reported the arrangement for the direct exchange of news by wireless between the Pars and Anatolian Agencies as a link m the rapprochement between the two countries. 2. I now have the honour to report certain respects in which the Turkish Embassy here seems specially favoured and which may conveniently be considered under three heads, military, diplomatic and court. 3. As regards military affairs, you are doubtless aware that the military attaches here (comprising the British, French, Russian, Japanese and Turkish) have not for many years been invited to attend any parades (other than the military review on the anniversary of the coup d'Etat) or to attend military functions of any description. 4. It seems to be a fact, however, that the Turkish military attache was singled out for an invitation to attend the army manoeuvres which were held near Tehran in November last, and that he was expressly asked by His Imperial Majesty the Shah to criticise the operations. Captain Orge apparently pointed out some errors in the tactical handling of the artillery and the Shah ordered that his criticisms and advice should be circulated throughout the army for its future guidance. Major Pybus, to whom I am indebted for this information, is of opinion that his Turkish colleague wms a brave officer, firstly in taking the Shah at his word and secondly, as a mere infantry officer, in presuming to teach a gunner his trade. Some time ago, too, His Britannic Majesty’s consul in Tabriz reported that several Turkish officers had attended the combined manoeuvres of the Eastern and Western Azerbaijan divisions which were held in October 1934. 5. In diplomacy the Turks are well served by their Ambassador, Mehmet Enis Akaygen, who in contrast to his predecessor is conciliatory, suave and quick witted. M. Enis was fortunate also in coming in on the crest’ of the wave at the time of the Shah's visit to Turkey, when a general air of friendliness between the two nations prevailed. It must, in part, be due to his skill that to-day this friendly feeling between the two heads of States appears to be no whit the less. At the recent No Ruz Salaam, M. Enis was the only diplomat whom the Shah seemed to me to regard with any pleasure. He’ is well supported bv his counsellor, M. Refet, and the rest of his staff. 6. In court circles, too, the Turkish Embassy has gained a footing where others have not. For the past year Mme. Enis and her tw T o young and vivacious daughters have been constant visitors at the palace, where, on an average of once a week, they take tea with the Queen and with the two elder princesses. 7. It is noteworthy also that when a deadlock appeared to have been reached in January in the negotiations at Bagdad, the Iraqi Government seemed to have conceived that appeal to the Shah could best be made through Angora and the Turkish Ambassador in Iran. And it will be remembered that after Persia had defined her own frontier with Turkey, the Persian and Afghan Governments invited a Turkish general to preside over the arbitral commission to fix the Perso- Afghan frontier, and that the Turk discharged this duty with success. 8. The reason underlying the Turco-Iranian rapprochement is no doubt to be found not merely in contiguity of territory or a common faith, but largely in the Shah’s conviction that Turkey and Iran are wayfarers on the same road of progress towards westernisation. Both have included in their programmes dress reform, language reform, the destruction of the power of the clergy, the substi tution of a national spirit for a national religion, apart from increase in [690 dd—2]armaments, and improvement of communications which, of course, are in no sense peculiar to these two countries. Nevertheless, to call the Iranian method a mere slavish imitation of the Turkish would, I believe, be less than the truth. I prefer to think that the Shah regards Turkey as a kind of pilot engine and hopes that, should there be a bomb on the line' to westernisation, the sight of Atatiirk ascending skvwards might enable Reza Shah to apply his brakes in time. 9. In the light of the above it is difficult to grudge Turkey the position of best friend. From this friendship the Shah may well hope also to get some insurance against Turkey’s ally, Soviet Russia, and even to exert greater influence on Iraq. Against this friendship between the heads of the two States must be set the age-long hostility between the two countries and the intense resentment felt in manv parts of Iran, notably round Tabriz, against Turkey as an ineradi- cally barbarous State responsible’for the unwanted changes now being forced upon a far more civilised country. 10. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora. I have, &amp;c. NEVILE BUTLER,No. 33 (T31/2/3 6) British Legation, Tehran. 18th January 1936. Sir, The Journal de Teheran announced on 15th January the beginning as from that date of a direct exchange of news by wirlees between the Pars and Anatolian agencies, and published a declaration by the Turkish Prime Minister on the subject in which Ismet Pasha emphasised the Turkish desire to find fresh means of completing the rapprochement between the two countries. 2. The Journal de Teheran reverts to this subject in its first article of 17th January, a copy of which I am enclosing. Apart from the purpose to which Isrnet Pasha referred - extended now to the four countries which have initialled the non-aggression pact - the object of the new exchange of news is to defend the Orient against malicious legends. Incidentally the four great Western powers are urged to follow the enlightened example set by the above pact to the extent of banding themselves against an aggressor; and a speech by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs is used to lay the laurels for the initiation of this Eastern pact at the feet of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. 3. An extended news service as regards all the three neighbouring and friendly countries is foreshadowed, and foreseeing perhaps that news from the Anatolian Agency or about these countries alone may not satisfy Iranian interest, the article makes it clear that the Pars Agency will continue to receive news from the big Western Agencies, sifting it with objectivity and impartiality. 4/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., Ltc., etc., etc., Foreign Office.2 4. Apart from the news aspect, the above is further evidence of the importance attached in Iranian circles to the Four Power Non-Aggression Treaty, and as Afghanistan at least seems in no hurry to conclude it until Irano-Iraqi disputes are settled, the Iraqi Government may be deriving some bargaining power from the situation. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador at Angora (131/2/36) and His Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad (No.3). I have the honour to be, etc. (Sd.) H.M.

The journey aimed at setting the seal on the new policy of friendship between the two nations initiated by the two great national leaders. 2.

I gather both from, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and from Feroughi Khan himself that the business to be transacted amounts to very little, and is more designed to provide some pabulum for public opinion in both countries than to fulfil any urgent political need. 2. The Treaty of Friendship and Security of the 22nd April, 1926, will be renewed, though, if I understood Tevfik Ru§tu rightly, article 1, recording inviolable peace and lasting friendship, will be taken out and recorded in a fresh and perpetual treaty. The two statesmen will also make a general survey of the relations of Persia with all her neighbours, especially with Russia, where Turkey’s close friendship with Moscow may prove useful to Persia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was possibly too polite to say so, but I have no doubt that he will be very fully informed of Mr. Hoare’s negotiations with the Persian Government. I might note in this connexion that Feroughi Khan, though as friendly and amiable as in the days when he was my colleague here, steered our conversation hastily into another direction whenever it looked like touching on the present relations between Great Britain and Persia. 3. Tevfik Rii^tii Bey further said that an extradition treaty might possibly also be negotiated. 4.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 352 of the 31st October last, I have the honour to report that the following instruments were signed at Angora on the 5th instant by the Turkish and Persian Ministers for Foreign Affairs : 1. A treaty of friendship, 2. A treaty of neutrality and of political and economic co-operation, and 3. An exchange of notes recording provisional agreement for extradition. The first two are intended to renew the Treaty of Friendship and Security of the 22nd April, 1926, and its protocol of the 15th June, 1928 (see Tehran despatches No. 225 of the 8th May, 1926, and No. 306 of the 27th June, 1928). The text of all three instruments will be transmitted to you as soon as copies can be obtained. 2. Tevfik Rii§tu Bey told me yesterday evening that the first two treaties were nothing more than the treaty of 1926 and the protocol oi 1928, divided into two separate instruments. His Excellency added that as soon as he and the Persian Government had fixed the date for publication, he would give advance copies of the texts of all the agreements to myself and to my Russian, Peisian, Iraq, and Afghan colleagues. 3. Feroughi Khan left with his suite for Constantinople on the evening oi the same day/the 5th November, and was seen off by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of National Defence, and numerous other officials. Several members of the Diplomatic Corps were also on the platform, including the counsellor of His Majesty’s Embassy, whom I asked to represent me, as I was confined to the house Avith a chill. The party reached C onstantinople the following morning, and Feroughi Khan is expected to remain there for se\'eral days, still as the guest of the Turkish Government, before leaving for Persia via Bagdad. . 4. The press of the 6th November published an official communique, dated the 5th November, of Avhich the following is a translation :— “His Highness Mohammed Ali Khan Feroughi, Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, had during his stay in Angora several intervieAvs Avith his Excellency Ismet Pasha, President of the Council, and also with Tevfik Riistii Bey, Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs. In the course of these interviews perfect conformity of political views was established. “ With a vieAv to strengthening still further the relations of cordial friendship existing between the tAvo countries, emphasis was laid on the great importance of personal contact betAveen the friendly statesmen of the two friendly States, as also on the desirability of increasing the number of such meetings. “Recent discussions have once again demonstrated the great benefits arising from the mutual comprehension and close co-operation of the tAA 7 o nations in the political and economic domains. “ Our Persian guests have been enabled, during their visit to Angora, to form an intimate acquaintance with all the manifestations of activity connected with the Kemalist regime, and have visited numerous Turkish establishments and institutions. o r t “ With a view to renewing the Treaty of Friendship and Security of the 22nd April, 1926, as also its protocol dated the 15th June, 1928, the two Ministers for Foreign Affairs have this day signed two treaties, one of friendship and the other of neutrality and political and economic co-operation, and, in addition, a provisional agreement concerning extradition.
