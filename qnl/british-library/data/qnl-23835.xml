I understand that a copy of Foreign Office Circular No.66 of July 26, 1949 was sent to you on August 18. I now enclose a copy of the Residency list of holidays for 1949. Some as you will see are Hindu holidays and as you have no Hindu staff I see no point in your observing them. Some of the others are distinctly overdone for instance the week at Christmas and the Moslem holidays. I suppose the latter depend on whether you are Sunni or Shia. And who ever heard before of a bank holiday on June 30? It seems to me that there is no point in your starting bad traditions in Doha but leave the selection of holidays you observe to your dis cretion. Political Agency, Bahrain, OctoberJLS, 1949 On the Id U1 Fitr it is the practice here to make calls the first day on the Ruler and the second day on relatives and others. This happens again on Id U1 Haj. Why I don’t know: nowhere else in the world to my knowledge does one pay two separate calls of this sort in one year. On New Year’s Day calls are returned ' by the Rulers and others. Gratuities are paid to office menial staff. In other posts it is once a year but here of course is twice: at Christmas and on the Id U1 Haj. I had some discussion with Gethin about this and came to the conclusion that it did not J matter much how many times a year they get a gratuity so long as the yearly total did not exceed Rs.10/- each. I myself do not see much point in giving a Moslem a present at Christmas. The gratuities should be debited as such in your Foreign Office accounts. / I presume you purchase coffee and insense for distinguished callers. I myself sometimes throw in a glass of orange squash as a personal contribu tion.
