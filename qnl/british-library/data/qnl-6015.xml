Brigadier Martin the Chief Engineer Iraq., and Colonel Crane the Deputy Chief Engineer, drove over from Basra yesterday and discussed the extension to the harbour facilities with Lieut-Col. Dickson, and Mr. Patrick, the Acting General Superin tendent of the Kuwait Oil Company at the Agency. led out to the Kuwait Oil Company pier and to the -landing Company's pier at Shuwaikh. He hoped that the Kuwait Oil Company would undertake the work and forward the bill to him. He also wanted a water tank of a minimum capacity of 100,000 gallons constructed and filled. Patrick said they could under- i take the work provided certain personnel could be provided and various materials not locally available. The site was inspected and it was agreed that the exact position of the water tank should be decided upon by Patrick and myself and that work should commence at once. It was also agreed that Patrick would work out the requirements for the pier extensions, begin ning with the innding Company pier, and also the approximate cost and that work would not start on these projects until Brigadier Martin had consulted the Transport experts and sent written confirmation. 4.

No. C/479 we have secured, yhat we believe to be, the required information you ask for. 1. Length of jetty 300 feet and width 16 feet. 2. Top of deck is 14 feet 2 inches above sea bed level at head of jetty. For your further information I might add that the level of ordinary spring tide is 2 feet 6 inches below the deck, which gives between 11 feet and 12 feet of water decreasing in depth until it reaches high water mark on foreshore 50 feet from the shore end of jetty. At lowest tides (January), the sea recedes 30 to UO feet from head of jetty; ordinary tides at other times do not usually leave jetty head at low water. I think 1 and 2 above is the information required by Brigadier C.G. Martin, V.C., C.B.E., D.S.O., but if you think best the other information might be also included. 11ajor T.

Prom the H.Q. Works L of C area point of view we recommend a contingency factor of % on the actual figures quoted by us for stages 1 , 2,3 and- and 5 fo on stage 5 * 3. The time estimate is almost entirely ruled by speed at which coral and v shingle can be supplied. In the case of coral availability of boats is the ruling factor. It is doubtful if more than 1000 cu. ft per day can be delivered over a prolonged period unless some special arrangements could be made with the aid of the Shaikh. 4. It is possible that work could be speeded considerably if Amy could arrange for supplies of Kharo- Island stone in large barges to supplement the local coral rock. This might be worth investigating, information could be obtained from Messrs. A.1.0.0. Abadan. 3. January is the month of the lowest tides and if this work is likely to be put in hand next year it would be advantageous to lay foundation layers up to beach level during that month. If this was done foundations would have to be finished off at sand level so as not to interfere with normal working of jetties. ^ 6 . In June, the month of high Shamals, (about 10th June to 10th July) very little work could be done except on upper parts of jetties. 7. If large quantities of cement are supplied before the rainy season ends, sufficient tarpaulins to cover piles of cement will be required. 8 . We have recently driven some piles for the water tank delivery stand pipe and met far less difficulty than anticipated indicating that there is less rock under the beach in this section than further east and some subsidence may be expected in the case of stage 2 , however this should not cause much difficulty and can be dealt with if and when it occurs. 9. The plan hereunder indicates roughly the finished work as visualized. 1 //VC- sufr/rg3BCH5T yolitlaal ^enoy. 3.0.'To. C/644-4/23 Kuwait, 29th Sovenher, 1941.

Presume maximum shipment of 300 cases at a time ^ — 200 trucks. Presume 1 crane on jetty can handle 1 case each 40 minutes. Working 24-hour shift, allow 4 hours down time for moving barges, oiling, greasing and moving cMtne. 2 cranes will handle 60 cases in 24 hours. i.e. would clear 300 cases in 5 days. = 200 lorries. Lightering Site of lighters to be supplied unknown, but presume they can stow 12 'to 16 cases each, average 14 cases. 2 cranes and five or preferably six lighters will be required to ensure continuous working, i.e., 2 lighters unloading at one time and 3 leading or in transit. ,, ,, _ . . With this equipment a ship with 300 cases would thus clear in 4 days leaving loaded lighters to be finished off by shore installation. Requirements This arrangement would handle 600 lorries, i.e., 900 esses in 15 days. 1 Tug (should be diesel owing to boiler water troubles) 6 Lighters (about 120* X 18*) 300 tons(?) 2-^ ton mobile dieiel slewing* &amp; luffing cranes with jibs capable of lifting 5 to 7 ton load at 25* to 30* radius. / Complete with crews, spares, fuel, lubricants, lines, anchors, slings etc. ready for service. ♦Drillers could learn to handle in few hours. NOTES. (1) An additional crane and 3 lighters would probably enable 1800 to N, 2000 trucks to be handled in a month, but does not allow for any breakdowns. _ ,, .. ,, (2) In utmost emergency with assistance of P*A. and Shaikh all suitable local era it down to vessels capable of carrying one case only, could be mobilised and could handle the lightering job, but landing of cases without damage and with any reasonable speed and efficiency would be impossible without cranes » Shore End. Any work such as previously proposed for extension of the jetties would prohibit the use of the existing jetties during the construction period and as the essence of the job sterns to be immediate availability, the answer is the construction of another jettey wider but otherwise of a similar JJfture to the existing ones - and not the joining up of the existing ones. The best position for a third jetiy would be further to the Vest, it woud neces -i- tate the removal of the fishermen’s huts etc. now existent „ It is considered thst there is not room for a third jetty between the existing jetties. ^ ^ . . , . , Advantage of existing jetties is that barges can be brought alo^side both sides aid in this way more craft can he unloaded at one time than if the two jetties were joined up. A third jetty would give facilities for six barges in all, at one time. clearanoe of packages from jetties can best be done by existing heavy trucks at start} iAey back on to jetty and receive load direct from crane. A truck would have ample time to take load to a clear assembly site, (south of main ror d near wai navigation marker) vdiere cases would be offlosder by rrounding one end ani driving out from under. Cooly gangs at this site with jacks, Aocks, etc. to let down the case when truck returns for next load. Later, assembled heavy trucks can also be used for this work.

T was astonished at the narrowness of the Khor Moduliah and the apparent ease with which it could be obstriicted by enemy action. I am unable to understand why Kuwait with its spacious harbour which I believe it would be practically impossible to effectively close is not nade ready for immediate use should either the hhatt-al-\rab or the Khor Vodullah be obstructed at some tine in the future. However I suppose the r ilitary and 'Taval duthoritiea, the latter bein^ I presumed vitally interested, have made their decision after full considaration and there is no more to be said. T am however surprised that the ^.meric^n Mission should have reached the same conclusion without even taking the trouble to visit Kuwait and examine the position for themselves.

As your Unit is now using for it’s water supply the water tank at Shuwaikh which^a g y o £ u. aye aware,was construc ted for war purposes under the 'Army authorities at Basra,^ I shall be grateful if you will undertake the responsibility for it^s proper control. Arrangements for filling the tank should be made by you direct with the Kuwait Y/ater Company which operates the water dhows running between here and Fao. I suggest that the tank be always kept as full as possible and that a boat load be ordered whenever the tank can take 12,000 gallons. The^ Americans now engaged on barge construction work at Shuwaikh also use this tank as their water supply, both for themselves and the labour they employ. A record of the water consumed by them is kept by their Chief Accountant and it v/as arranged that as soon as they had consumed a quantity equal to one boat load i.e. 12,000 gallons they would themselves order a boat load from the Kuwait Yater Company and pay for it. I suggest this arrangement be confirmed in writing. In order to afford greater protection Mr# Scott, General Superintendent of the Kuv/ait p Oil-Company has kindly agreed to place locks on the roof door* The keys of these locks should be kept by you. The handle of the hand pump should be removed at the end of the day, and you will doubt less be able to come to some arrangement with the Americans regarding this. The hand pump belongs to the Army authorities and if not required by you should be taken over by the Americans. There remains the question of Guards. Unless you con make alternative arrangements I consider that in order to prevent unauthorised persond taking water from the tank and to ensure the maximum protection, Arab Guards should be provided. Two would be required and they would be employed on the same terms as those to be provided for the protection of your posts.( 2 ) (3) Your letter reference No.C/730-4/E8 dated 28.7.42. is acknowledged. It is agreed that this Unit will take over the proper control and responsibility of the Water Tank. Arrangements will also be made to contact the Americans now engaged on Barge construction at Shuwaikh with a veiw to ascertaining the arrangements in force regarding the purchase of water from The Kuwait Water Company. When this question is settled, confirmation will be sent to you. Arrangements will also be made with the Americans regarding use of the hand pump. / officer, for Plight Lieutenant, Commanding, 38 Wireleas.Unlt^CONFIDENTIAL 4 rm \ N 0 V o ^ b Dated ^ ^rom 3$/Ii.p^iess To The Political Agent, Kuwait.

Dear Hickin'botham, I refer to telegrH^s exchanged with you and am most grateful for your reply through the Navy. The position is that as a result of an over- supply of ships from America there have been for some time six or seven ships lying at the Bar awaiting Berths at the Persian ports. They come to no harm there hut naturally the crews get restive and though I am hopeful that this may not happen there is a possibility that over the next month the number may increase. We have been discussing with the Americans Aether it would not be better to put the ships in to Koweit where they may be able to obtain a few fresh provisions while the crews could get ashore and the ships lie in better shelter#. The snag at the moment is Charts, as most of these ships have only the general Gulf Chart and the Navy think it best that they should not attempt to enter Koweit without Chart No.22. An additional supply of these is being sent over from India as at present we have not sufficient to send down to meet ships and we have to lend Charts to the few which call with craft for erection. When the Charts arrive we will review the position and I will let you know in good time if it is decided to send any ships to Koweit. It is probable that the'j#* stay there will be for about three weeks. Major T. Hickinbotham, Political Agent, Koweit. WHL:DTC onfidential . D.0.

Please see paragraph 3 of .ay telegraa of the 9th of January in Thich I intimated that fresh water and supplies would not he available. Perhaps I should make it clear that by supplies I meant all kinds of provisions. 3. T am afraid that it has now been decided that the crews 'souId not be allowed to land. 3nnuiries shov that even in more civilised ports where adequate police arran gements and launch facilities exist the behaviour of ships* crews has not been all that could be desired. In Kuwait we have no European police and no adeauate arrangements for the conveyance of men to and from ships ua^ but we have uncivilised element in the population so to avoid any risk of unpleasant incidents the decision has been made not to permit crews ashore.

In theory this launch vhich is owned anrj. maintained by the Kuwait Governieut is at the quarantine felical Officer’s absolute disposal free of all charge 'hen a shio arrives in the harbour, in practice tne launch is sometimes being use! by the Port Director or Shaikh Ablulla Palim to visit 'alaicha but this does not often happen and vhen it does the quarantine Medical Officer’goes out with the agent.
