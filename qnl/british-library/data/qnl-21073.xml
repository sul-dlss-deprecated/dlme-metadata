The reason for the 2era!an Government’* protest is obvious enough* the issue of such stamps * unimportant in itself - is one :mrm sign of Bahrain’s independence, conducing towards m further weakening of the Persian claim. it is possible that they * the Persian Cover men t * may shortly revive the whole question of their , -O' ' claim, with the usual threat perhape of a report to the :{') f———MM—Mi League of Hat!one# I hr^e baaa giring the question of fcfee Persian claim to iiaiiraiHi some tLo^bt sines arrival nsrs« and the following are some tentative comments and suggestions. 5* In going through the corves pond once on tm subject hers # of which there is u groat deal* i .have perused Mr* Lodd’s note of 4th March 1932 t which fomed an enclosure to W* Hoars*s letter of 9th March t© the foreign Office* In their express letter of 50th May 1952 the Oover-tment of India, ©©lamenting on Mr* .Dodd’s note, said;. * the suggestion there md* that His Majesty’s Government should decline to act as intermediary and should simply refer Persian aovernment to Lhaikh is attractive but we would invite attention to agro^ent of 1892 by which the Shaikh of Bahrain and or took not to enter into any eorrespondonce with any tower other than the British Government*. The main gist, however, of Mr* Dodd’s argument ms, X think, not the question of the Persian -levernmeat referring to the Shaikh direct, but that* (a) As the Shaikh was an independent sovereign the lersl&amp;n Government could not cite His Majesty*s Government before the League for arbitration in connection with any question concerning his independence. (b) for a similar reason the Persian Government could not cite the Shaikh himself before the League, quite apart from the fact that Im mm not a member. \.

The * Shaikh is the authority concerned.

If you like to inform the Sh&amp;lfc! * that you wish him to submit his sovereignty to w arbitration, we will act as a post office for that * purpose, but you can guess very well what his reply * will be. After you have received the Shaikh*s * refusal it is for you to decide what you will do* ** You may like to take the matter up to the League, * but as you know Bahrain is not a member of the * League, and even If it were the latter oftmot 4 Could we not therefore at the next suitable opportunity force .». * *this ♦ * * * • -4- il * force arbitration on one of ito membere regarding * the eovereignty the latter** s * 1 do know ^iat the ieraian Governsient will do next but they might adopt heraeeing taotice with regard to Baiirain dhows # ate.# It we eee eigne of their taking this line I suggest we could Issue them with the following warning ^^ith reference to such am such an incident we notice -‘that you ha to started harassing Bahrain dhows (or ** what ewer it my be).

The results of this suggestion ars dealt with in ay despatch Ho. 145 of 11th October 1932 addressed to His Majesty’s Minister, ' Tehran,(1©,761~S of 11th October 1932 to Secretary of State for India and Government of India), With regard to the second publicity case. In December 1930 an unfortunate British Indian subject was brutally flogged by the orders of a Persian military officer at Citarbar* His Majesty 1 * Government demanded from the Persian Government punishment of the officer, and compensation for the victim, the Persian Government awarded a nominal punishment on the offender, and refused compensation point blank. At the suggestion of His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, His Majesty’s Government, the Indian Government concurring, sanctioned that the Persian Government should be threatened with C publicity if they did not pay the compensation, After some argument the Persian Government paid up* ( aee correspondence ending with despatch ho,231, dated 17th November 1931, from Mr, Ho*re te Jir Hugh 'Biscoe (copies to Foreign office and \ Government of India) # I think that these two of ses show that the Persian Government do definitely 'respond to treatment*V v?)

As you know we gave Dodd’s arguments very careful consideration when the memorandum first reached us, and reluctantly came to the conclusion that they were fallacious and misleading. I sent you a copy of the relevant portions of a letter which Oliphant wrote to Hoare on the subject on April 19th under cover of my private letter No. E.3456/935/91 of July 18th. As Fowl© has had Dodd’s memorandum and obviously been strongly influenced by it, I think it would be only fair that he should also have our views on it.

It appeared preferable to His Majesty's Government to suspend any action until the political situation arising from the unilateral cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's cone ess ion vas clearer. 2, The receipt of the circular letter of vh i ch a copy is now enclosed fron the Internationa,! Bureau of the Universal Postal Union necessitates consideration of the desirability of any longer leaving unchallenged the Persian assertions on the subject of the status oi Bahrein. And. this is more particularly so in view of the wide publicity which will be given to the circular in qiestion. The terms of the Persian note, in the absence of any contradiction, mipht well produce a very unfortunate impression on states unfamiliar with the history of the Bahrein dispute. 3./ ,e Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Fo re ign Sc Pcl i ti c al Dec ar tmen t, 'Delhi.3 U 0 iAc) K of His letter Siioject io the views of the Government of India and Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, to whom a copy of this is being sent by the Foreign Office with a revest that he will communicate his observations direct to the Government of India, His Majesty’s Government are disposed to think that some reply would be desirable. They are further disposed to think that it would be preferable that the matter should be dealt with on a postal rather than on a political basis; and that the simplest course would be that, if no objection is seen, the competent Postal authority in India (presumably the Director General of Poets and Telegraphs) should write to the International Bureau d the Universal Postal Union with reference to the Persian letter circulated in the Union’s circular letter No.653/25, of 26th January to the effect that, since Bahrein is not Persian territory and consequently the Persian Government have no right to dictate what stamps the Sheikh shall issue, the Sheikh, at whose request a British Indian post office has for many years been maintained in Bahrein, is wi thin his sovereign rights in requesting the Government of India to arrange for the issue of stamps surcharged as new proposed. If the Government of India, in the light of Mr.Hcare’s remarks, concur in the action proposed, I am to ask that they will cause the necessary steps to be taken and will send a copy of any communication which may be addressed to the Bureau to this Office and to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,P*£*10,iU/33* Foreign Office, 22rd 'February 1922* Bo.73* {E.1037A2a/91) Sir, With roferenoo to your do«p at oh 10*482 of the 18th Boy ember regarding the proposed imue of Indian portage ntmpn bearing the nureharge *Bohrein ,, t I transmit to you the aoaompallying oopiee of further eorretpondonoe on thio subjaet• 2* I repueot that you will inform the Gorermerit of India by telegraph whether you see any objection to the motion proposed in paragraph 3 of the India office letter of the 23rd February, repeating your telegram to me. 3* I shall be rl&amp;4 if you will bear in mind the undesirabii ity on general grounds of the indefinite suspension of the issue of the new postage stamp© and will, when the political situation in your opinion become© sufficiently clear, furnish me with your views on this point. 1 mm &amp;e (34 •) Gr • # *Ben 4 el * H *H *iio ar e led ■ &gt; ^ ^ ^ # etc*, etc*, etc*, Tehran*I he Hon ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his com pliments to The Political Agent, Bahrain, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of tlm undermentioned docu ment (V)/ x'or information* British Residency and Consulate-General, BUSHIRE, a Dated... .7.th .April. 1933.#...

June 1 st, 1933. r Your telegram 11&gt; of April Pint about the surcharged Bahrain stamps is on my mind now that I an on the point of going on leave. I was unwilling to act on the lines agreed upon while the Anglo-'^ersian Oil Company business was still unsettled and with the passage of time my unwillingness has grown - exactly why I find it difficult to say, though partly because I really think that with treaty negotiations in the air the original proposal to surcharge the stamps was a mistake. It is true that T did not protest, but having only just arrived I did not realize that the matter was of any importance. ''here is no doubt that if their present mood lasts, the ^ersian Coverrment ^nfl the Shah will want to get on with the treaty when 1 get back in the autumn. I T m not particularly hopeful that we shall achieve anything, but even if we won't I am rather inclined to believe that a 'state of negotiation'is not as un satisfactory a situation as we have sometimes thought, by which I mean that the Persians are rather less likely to provoke incidents if they are negotiating than if they are not. If therefore Bahrain can bear to wait in the hope that we shall get Persian recognition of her independence in the autumn, I favour waiting; but if to wait wouldpake things definitely difficult for Loch and Oastrell, then 1 think/ H.A.F.Metcalfe,Esquire,C.I.E., M.

The basic of our action in introducing the sur charged stamp is that T ah rain is an independent State, of which the Baler has aefced the British Government to Issue his own at amps for him. To continue to use un surcharged British Indian stamps, without the Pier’s assent, wouL 1 then constitute a violation of the very sovereignty, which the introduction of the surcharged stamp is designed to support. To ask his assent is clearly impossible, for, apart from other/ath*r conn! d«mticm© § h# wottld th# fUlflSmimt of such ft request «« dcstroTlnir the ▼fane of the su*Qhsr*cd *tmp as an outward m€ rlsihle nlpp of the Sndcoend^ce of Bahrain* 4.

It is true that it is possible to retort that this course is only adopted owing to tho unreasonable attitude of the Persian Oovewmont # but it seems necessary to remember that the Postal Hnion may not be friendly disposed in the matter and may accept the damaging Btrsian contention rather than our excuse* The Persian Oovemment may* moreover, put into force ^ f&gt; ii r rr ' '' T '~ T ) their threat of treat- Bee Circtalar letter Ho # 663/Ph dated ) the S6th JubV - 1933 from the Bireeteur,) ing all postal articles Bureau International de I’^nion ) Bcstale Hniverselle, ) fr?oi %hr«in not frank ed with stamps as unfranked, and of only delivering them to the addressees against a payment of twice the internal postage, which would render our use of Inc 1 ian stamps ineffective and place us in a position in which it would be difficult to make any protest. 5, If the or si an Government take any action involving interference with articles in the post, the proper remedy seems to lie in a complaint to the 'ostal Union.

My argument that the letters were addressed care of me also fell absolutely flat. T The rule is^ he said, ’that a registered letter must be delivered to none but the addressee’ n . 2.

You will see that it bears a 'By Air Mail' label, Indian stamps to the value of 2$ annas and Indian stamps with the sur charge 'Bahrein' to the value of 8 annas. 3. A sum of 8 rials was demanded by the postal authorities for shortage of stamps at the time the letter was delivered and paid as a matter of routine by the Munshi in charge of the posts. 4. Subsequently I caused private enquiries to be made of the postal authorities, as a matter of interest, with a view to ascert aining their exact attitude towards surcharged stamps. They explained that as the envelope was sent by air mail the correct postage, according to its weight, was 10^ annas. But of the 10i annas worth of stamps which it bore, 8 annas were surcharged 'Bahrein'. The Persian Government did not recognise these stamps and their original instructions had been that all letters bearing these stajups should be returned to the senders. These Instructions had later been cancelled, however, and it was now laid down that surcharged stamps should be considered as non-existent and the usual double charge for under-stamping levied in respect of any shortage which their use might occasion. For such calculations (presumably the gold rupee) one rupee is at present taken as the equivalent of 8 rials, and the sum of 8 rials was therefore levied for a shortage of £ 5.

I said that both the Resident and I had been pressing for the immediate issue of the stamps and that the intention had been to issue them directly the Minister at Tehran had made a statement to the Persian Government. I said that there seemed to be some question as to whether this statement was desirable (personally I did not think that it was necessary and that we should get on with the issue of the stamps). I said that it was likely that the issue would now be made after my departure,and,therefore,if Capta.in Gastrell was not here,would like him to know about the matter. I wished to nave a set mounted on passe-partout to present to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad as a memento from the Agency. This should be done and I think that it might be well for the set to be handed to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad by the Indian Assistant if the Political Agent is away, but he had better mention the matter to Mr .Belgrave before doing so. I also told Mr.Belgrave that it had been my intention to tell the Shaikh that the King is an enthusiastic collector of stamps and that he might like to send the first set of the Bahrain issue to His Majesty with a suitable letter of thanks for the institution of the Bahrain issue. If I (or Captain Gastrell) am away when the issue is made Mr.Belgrave will see that a suitable letter is writtenand sent and will also arrange for the stamps to be put up in a suitable way so that they may not be damaged. I should be obliged if Mr.Thomas would at once call Mr.Belgrave 1 s attention to the issue as soon as it is made. 2. I have asked the Post Master to let me know directly the stamps arrive and also before they are actually issued. I have told him that my reason is that I want to give the Shaikh a present of the stamps before they are actually put on sale to tne public. If I am away he should letmm r Telegram:-No:1876 dated 1-8-1933 from foreign Simla. 1.
