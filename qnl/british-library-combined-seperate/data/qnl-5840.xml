It concerns Britain's relations with Bin Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] following the latter's occupation of Ottoman-ruled El Hassa [Al Hasa] and Nejd [Najd]. Much of the correspondence is concerned with how Bin Saud's occupation of Nejd and El Hassa will affect the continuing Anglo-Turkish negotiations [for the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, which was never ratified] and British foreign policy in the region more generally.Also discussed in the volume are the following: whether the British should allow the transhipment of Ottoman troops in Bahrein waters; a visit (regarded after the event as 'ill-advised' by the Secretary of State for India) paid by the Political Agent, Koweit [Kuwait], Captain William Henry Irvine Shakespear, to Bin Saud, at Majma'a [Al Majma], six weeks before Bin Saud occupied El Hassa; the death of Sheikh Jasim-bin-thani [Shaikh Jāsim bin Muḥammad Āl Thānī, Ruler of Qatar]; British hopes of securing the early withdrawal of the Turkish garrison from El Katr [Qatar]; reports that the Turkish Government intends to respond to the events in Nejd by appointing Bin Saud as Mutessarif [Mutasarrif] of the district.The following principal correspondents appear in the volume: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Sir Percy Zachariah Cox; the Viceroy of India [Charles Hardinge]; the Secretary of State for India, the Marquess of Crewe [Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes]; the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India, Thomas William Holderness; His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, Gerard Augustus Lowther; the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Edward Grey; the Political Agent, Koweit; Bin Saud.The part includes a divider that gives the subject and part number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in the part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>El Hassa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Nejd</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military occupation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Conventions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Ottoman Convention (1913)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000117#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000117#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
