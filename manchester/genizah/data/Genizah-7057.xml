Because of the repeated reference to the man's poor means, it seems the basis for this letter is the inheritance of money or property. The text is torn in the middle, so perhaps some of the important details are found there (the names concerned etc.).</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:type>Manuscripts</dc:type><dc:title>Arabic document</dc:title></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
