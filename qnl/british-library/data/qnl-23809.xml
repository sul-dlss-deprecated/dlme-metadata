MEMO : Pen icillin - T he Residency Hospital y Bushire • With reference to your memo: dated 18.5*46, please convey to The Hon’ble The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf my willing co-operation to fall in with his wishes to supply The Residency Hospital with 1,000 000 units (10 vials) Pencillin monthly from my monthly consignments from London if the authorities will augment my supplies proportionately. 2. As soon as each consignment arrives I will then for- -ward 10 vials to the Q.M.O. Bahrain to keep refrigerated pending shipment to Bushire. 5* The cost is approximately £ 0. 10. 0. per vial of 100 000 units, i.e. i 5. per month including air freight- -age. I will however forward an exact statement of accounts to the Agency at the end of each current year. 4. Regarding increasing my present indent to meet the needs of Bushire, will you very kindly order the necessary extra om my behalf,as I have no powers to procure this from w£4fe India Office or the other London authorities direct. If Mr F.A*K. Harrison External Dept: India Office be approached by the Political Dept: asking him to arrange for a further 10 vials (Total 1 million units) Penicillin to be added to my monthly indent,earmarked for The Residency,Bushire, there should be no difficulty in procuring it./ *11 GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. 2 . 5* The procedure whereby Pencillin was granted by the India Office to the Bahrain Government in October 1945 was highly involved, and its monthly journey out from the manufacturers to this dept: is still very indirect,although it arrives quickly enough, unrefrigerated, to be potent and effective. India Office first authorised Pencillin as being essential for Bahrain,and they requested The Director of Medical Supplies, Ministry of Supply^,to supply. The Pencillin Production Control Dept: were in turn deputed to arrange. It is this dept; who forwards the monthly consignments to India Office for forwarding by air freightage to the Agency,Bahrain, for eventual forwarding to the Bahrain Govt: Medical Dept; Its monthly journey from door to door is therefore:- Messers: Boots,manufacturers to Pencillin Production Control Dept: to India Office to B*0*A*C. to The Agency,Bahrain to Bahrain Govt: Medical Dept: I wish this arrangement could be shortcircuited. It would certainly help and save 24 hours if you would kindly authorise B«0*A*Co Bahrain to telephone me its arrival so I can instantly clear it and refrigerate it,without it passing through your office. 6. I gather that Pencillin is becoming increasingly plentiful in England,so I anticipate that this present arrangement will not be in force for more than a year,after which we will be able to procure the drug direct from the manufacturers in any quantity. 20.5.46 State Medical Officer, Bahrain.GTC Secretary to the Political Resident,Busbire.
