I have si f sted the following points to them:- (1) That all streets and lanes be named. (2) That all the bouses and amaras be numbered. (3) That 25 men be engaged from India for the work whose duties should be:- (a) A Jemadar to supervise the cleaning &amp; lighting o^ the town. (b) Two assistant Tamadare to help him. (c) Two men to light the lamps in the town. (d) Twenty sweepers to clean the town from 6A.M to Noon a^fi, 3 to 5 P.M. (4) That a plot of ground be alloted to these men to build their huts. (5) A number of stations be named in di^ferant parts of thetown where all the wastes be collected and that the sweepers are to remove them twice a day to a place where they could be burnt. (6) That a dozen of wheel-borrows (hand c^rts) be got from India, in which sweepers are to remove waste^from the town to the place of burning. (7) That a fund should be started in order to purchase the lamps for lighting the town. These- lamps should be replaced annua lly. (8) That an estimate ot* expenditure should be calculated and accordingly tax each house and amara so as to maintain the the upkeep of the establishment. I hope these suggestions would meet the pre sent requirements but, I think, i^ funds *permit,it would add to the convenience and improvement of the scheme if the town is di vided and subdivided in several quarters where waste- cisteras could be placed on each station for collecting wastes. ThatdD That all the cess-pools in streets and lanei he removed and an attempt he made to introduce the drainage sys. tem Isadine- the waste water into the se^-where this is not possi ble a big cistern should be built at eaiy distances from which the sweepers are to remove th* water daily* of the town|so as to avoid dirting lanes and street-sweepers are to clean the privies daily. That measures should he taken against those who disregard ordersjand throw wastes or call of nature in public streets or lanes. Once this work is well in hand there will he opportunities to improve the scheme. I am glad to say that the scheme is being discussed with great zeal and interest at Maha- rraq and I am sure it will he carried out there* improve the sanitary condition of Manama and I am quite confi- ^ dent that neither money nor zeal will he wanting in Manama to make the scheme permanent and successful one* However we may try / our best; I think it is very important that we should have a qualified doctor with experience of making of the Health Depart- ment of Municipality in large city,who may he able to inspect the work and suggest improvements on Sanitary lines* Though I hope to leave shortly for India,I trust that Sanitary measures in Manama would he introduced very soon. My brother who will succeed me will,no doubt,take very keen interest in the work-while I am in Karachi I would he very plea sed to assist from there with anything that I may he asked to supply to further this object. In addition to cleaning Sc lighting of Manama town there is another great difficulty felt by the people- that of supply of water to the town. The present time is not quite suitable to handle this question hut hope after the war it will he possible to do so. Finally I sincerely wish and trust in God that the Allies will he victorious in this World War. That privies should he built in several parts r I think time has come to make a start to</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001aa_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/947</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001aa</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/947</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File No. 40 Muharraq: sanitary measures in.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1918/1918</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-07-16T21:54:20</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (7 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the back cover with 7; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
