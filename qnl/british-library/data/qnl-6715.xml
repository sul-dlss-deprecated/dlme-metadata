British Relations with the Wuhahees. # [Communicated by the India Office.] IN April 1866 the then Wahabee Amir, Imam Abdullah-bin-Eysul, entered into a voluntary engagement with the British Government (in the form of a declaration, which was not signed on our side), by which he bound himself— 1. Not to oppose or injure British subjects residing in territories under his authority. 2. Not to “ injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, specially on the Kingdom of Muscat, further than in receiving the zukat that has been customary of old.” With the decline of the Wahabee power and the withdrawal of their influence from politics on the coast, the above engagement ceased to be of practical value, and all relations between the Wahabees and ourselves came to an end. It is worth recording that in October 1901, at a October^i^isoi. 01 ^ ^ me ser i° us intertribal disturbances in the interior of Arabia, we came to an understanding with the Turkish Government that we would do what we could to discourage the Sheikh of Koweit from aggressive action, on the under standing that the Turks would endeavour to restrain the Amir of Nejd. The successes of the present Wahabee Amir, Abdul Aziz-bin-Saoud, over his rival the Amir of Nejd (Abdul Aziz-bin-Rashid) again brought the Wahabee question to the front. In February Mr. Brodrick’s 1904, when the Government of India were telegram of ., . -i * i a February 8,1904. considering a proposal to send an Agent to Biadh, the Wahabee capital, for the purpose of collecting information on Central Arabian affairs, Mr. Brodrick telegraphed to the Viceroy as follows:— Lord Lansdowne “No steps should be taken to enter into closer relations with Nejd, or send Agents there, 1098 (2) B ywithout previous sanction of His Majesty's Government.” Sir N. O'Conor, who was consulted, wdiile recognizing the advantages of obtaining fuller information as to affairs in the interior of Arabia, held that the moment was not opportune for the action suggested ; and to this opinion the Govern ment of India, after receiving the view r s of Colonel Kemball, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, subscribed in a despatch dated the 24th March, 1904. They considered, however, that, in view of recent developments of the situation, there w^as reason to think that “ it may shortly be incumbent on us to take a more lively interest in the affairs of Central Arabia,” and they added that: “ later, .... when the political situation in Nejd has developed, and above all if the present representative of the Wahabee family .... succeeds in establishing and ex tending his ascendancy, which from the latest accounts received seems to be not imj^robable, we think that it may be desirable again to enter into relations with our old ally.” The successes of Bin Saoud in April 1904 led the Turkish Government to send troops and guns to the assistance of Bin Rashid. Bin Saoud thereupon wrote to the Besident in the Persian Gulf on the 2nd May, 1904, protesting against the Turkish invasion and soliciting the protection of Great Britain for himself and his country. At the same time the Resident received from Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit a letter addressed to the latter by Bin Saoud, in which he hinted that, if he failed to obtain British protection, he might have to fall back on the Russian offer of assistance made to him in 1903. The Govern ment of India, in reporting this on the 20th May, suggested that it might become necessary to revive the proposal to post a British Resident at Koweit, in order to watch events, should the Turks persist in armed intervention. Sir N. O’Conor had already been instructed, on the 10th May, 1904, to point out to the Porte that His Majesty’s Government, in the hope of assisting to preserve the peace, had “employed special efforts to dissuade the Sheikh of Koweit from taking part, even indirectly, in the hostilities that have broken out,” and to protest against any action being taken by the Turkish Govern ment “ which might add still further to the Sir N.

O’Conor was further ins tructed by telegraph to communicate at once with the Porte, and to repeat in urgent terms the representations he had already been instructed to make. Sir N. O’Conor replied on the 23rd May that it was difficult to see on what grounds the Porte could be pressed to refrain from assisting the Amir of Nejd, who was the party attacked. He considered that we should confine ourselves for the present to maintaining intact the territory o f Koweit and awaiting developments, but that, if the Turks persisted in rendering assistance to Bin Pashid, it might be expedient to reconsider the question of appointing a British Besident at Koweit. The substance of Sir N. O’Conor’s views was telegraphed to India on the 24th May. In reply the Government of India, in a telegram dated the 29th May, suggested that Sir N. O’Conor should be instructed to inform the Porte that we had no desire to assist Bin Saoud directly or indirectly, but that if, as a result of Turkish support, Bin Rashid became unduly powerful, our interests in Eastern Arabia might be injuriously affected. They held that British prestige at Koweit would be impaired if, by preventing Mubarak from assisting his friend and ally Bin Saoud, and by stopping the importation of arms, we allowed Turkish influ ence to determine the supremacy of the Turkish nominee in Central Arabia. Their conclusions were that an Agent should be sent to Koweit, and that the arms trade there should not be interfered with. The proposal to send an officer as Political Agent to Koweit was approved by His Majesty’s Government, and the Government of India were informed accordingly on the 24th June, 1904. It was decided at the same time to defer for the present any fresh measures for the prevention of the importation of arms at Koweit. Captain Knox, the officer appointed, proceeded to Koweit in August 1904 Towards the end of August 1904 the Turks, who had hitherto supported Bin Rashid, made overtures to Bin Saoud, and the latter applied to Sheikh Mubarak for advice as to how the Turkish advances should be met. Mubarak approached4 the Political Agent at Koweit on the subject in October 1904, but Captain Knox informed him that he had no instructions to give advice, and that Bin Saoud should consult his own interests in the matter. On the 30th December, 1904, Mr. Brodrick telegraphed to the Govern ment of India that “ His Majesty’s Government desire that it should be clearly understood that their interest and influence are to be confined strictly to coast-line of Eastern Arabia, and that nothing should be said or done to connect them even indirectly with warfare now in progress in interior. They agree that Knox should give no opinion on advice to be given by Mubarak to Bin Saoud, but should repeat to former warnings already given against entanglements in interior.” It may be added that in February 1905 a meeting took place at Koweit between Sheikh Mubarak, the Turkish Vali of Bussorah, and Bin Saoud’s father, and Bin Saoud seems subsequently to have come to terms, for the time being, with the Turkish Government. Towards the end of 1905 Bin Saoud, whose successes in Nejd had continued unabated, paid a visit to El Katr and addressed letters to the Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast, announcing his intention of visiting their territories in the following spring. The most important of the Trucial Chiefs, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, con ferred personally with the Sultan of Muscat on the situation, both rulers regarding the prospect of Bin Saoud’s visit with considerable apprehension. The Government of India addressed the Secretary of State on the subject in a despatch dated the 11th January, 190b, in which they pointed out “ how very serious to our prestige and influence the consequences might be if Bin Saoud should attack the Pirate Coast Chiefs or the Sultan of Muscat, or succeed in extending his influence over them, and how important it is that we should prevent, as far as lies in our power, such a contingency, especially now that the Wahabee Amir has recognized the suzerainty of the Sultan.” They accordingly proposed that inquiry should be made, either through Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit or through the Sultan of Muscat, as to Bin Saoud’s intentions, with a view to ascertaining “ whether he is prepared to stand by the engagement of his predecessors not to oppose or injure British subjects residing in his Captain Knox to Captain Trevor, October 17, 1904.

O’Conor had been consulted on the proposal to approach Bin Saoud otherwise than through the medium of the Turks. Meanwhile, on the 19th January, 1906, Captain Knox, the Political Agent at Koweit, had talked the matter over informally with Mubarak, and after inquiring as to the truth of the reports regarding Bin Saoud’s inten tions, gave the Sheikh a hint that any inter ference by the TV ahabee Amir in the affairs of States in Treaty relation with us would not be likely to find favour with the British Govern ment. Mubarak replied that he regarded Bin Saoud’s plans as designed merely to extort money from the Sheikhs on the coast, and that he had himself written to Bin Saoud strongly advising him against persisting in any such attempt. Major Cox, in reporting this conversation to the Government of India, suggested that he should be authorized to inform all the Trucial Chiefs that the Government of India “would not regard with complacency the intrigues of any of them with Bin Saoud.” The Government of India telegraphed on the 15th March, 1906, supporting Major Cox’s sug- Sir N. O’Conor, March 20, 1906. gestion, which was approved, with the concur rence of the Foreign Office, by Mr. Morley’s telegram dated the 9th April. As regards the warning to Bin Saoud con templated by the Government of India, the Foreign Office adopted the views of Sir N. 1098 (2) C6 J O’Conor, who had been consulted and had recommended in a despatch dated the 20th March, 1906, that any such warning should be conveyed ^ ^ direct to Bin Saoud, and not through the agency of the Sheikh of Koweit or tlie Sultan of Muscat. Sir N. O’Conor further suggested that Bin Saoud, in the event of his visiting the coast, should be met by a British vessel of war at one of the places which he proposed to visit, and told that no tampering with the engagements and Conventions of the Trucial Chiefs would he permitted. In conveying the decision of His Majesty’s Mr. Morley’s Government to the Government of India, the JpnUS 1 ’i906 Secretary of State wrote as follows in a despatch dated the 13th April, 1906 :— “ His Majesty’s Government accept the view that a warning to the Amir would be necessary if he were to carry out his reported intention. They consider, however, that it would be better that such warning should' be conveyed to him only in the event of his appearing upon the coast, and that it should then be conveyed to him directly as proposed by Sir N. O’Conor.” Bin Saoud’s reply to Mubarak’s letter of advice was communicated to the Political Agent, Koweit, on the 25th Pebruary, 1906. Major Cox described it as a “ very courteous response.” The terms of Bin Saoud’s letter, as translated from the vernacular, are obscure, but his apparent object was to disclaim any intention of objectionable action. As a matter of fact, Bin Saoud did not visit the Pirate Coast. In April 1906 news was received of the defeat and death of Bin Bashid at the hands of his rival, Bin Saoud. On the 16th September, 19(^6, Major Cox again raised the question of entering into closer relations with the interior of Arabia. He drew attention to-tire-overtures that had been made by and on behalf of Bin Saoud with a view to the establishment of a closer connection between himself and the British Government, and recom mended that the opportunity should be taken to come to.terms with the Wahabee Chief on the following grounds:— Major Cox to Government of India, Aprils, 1906. Major Cox to Government of India, September 16, 1906. 'S'lf.t 1. That overtures had been made at various imes by Bin Saoud himself, and by Sheikh^7 Jasim-bin-Thani of Katr and Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit on Bin Saoud’s behalf, witli a view to securing for the latter some measure of British protection, and that if we neglected these over tures Bin Saoud and his following might regard us with hostility. 2. That if a friendly understanding were to exist between the British Government and Bin Saoud, both the Sultan of Muscat and the Trucial Chiefs would be fortified by the know ledge that any attempt on the part of the W ahabee to make a descent upon Oman would involve a preliminary rupture between him and the British Government. 3. That if Bin Saoud were our friend he would be able to assist us in suppressing piracies in the northern part of the Gulf. 4. That such a friendly understanding would facilitate Major Cox’s dealings with the Trucial Chiefs and would render it possible for our officers to make occasional tours in the Nejd country. . 5. That the Arabs of Cent ral Arabia, apparently driven to desperation by Turkish interference, seemed disposed to make common cause to throw off the yoke, and were apparently trying to secure the support of the Sheikh of Koweit and even of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Bealizing, how ever, that they were not strong enough to stand alone, they saw the necessity of enlisting the support of a Christian Power, and if we did not respond they might approach some other Power. It may be explained that, in addition to the overtures of Sheikh Mubarak and Sheikh Jasim the subject had also been broached by an emis sary of Bin Saoud himself, one Musaad-bin- Suweilim, who arrived at Bahrein in Januarv 1906 and informed the British Agent there that Bin Saoud now felt himself strong enough to turn the Turks out of Hassa and Katif, and then wished to enter into Treaty relations with the British Government, allowing us, if we desired, to keep a Political Officer in Hassa or Katif in return for our protecting him from a sea attack by the Turks. Major Cox’s letter of the 16th September, 1906, was sent home for information in the ordinary course, without comment, in October 1906. / Mr. Morley’s On the 9th November Mr. Morley informed November 9, 1906 . the Government of India by telegram that “ His Majesty’s Government maintain view 1098 (2) D8 that their interest and influence should he confined to coast.” * c No steps,” the telegram added, “ should be taken to enter into relations with Nejd or to send Agents into interior without my previous sanction.” Bin Saoud lost little time in renewing his application. In October 1906 he sent a further message through Sheikh Jasim, in which his proposals were set forth in greater detail. This message, which was delivered by Sheikh Jasim to the interpreter of the British Political Agent, Bahrein, was thus reported by Captain Prideaux on the 17th November, 1906 :— “The resources of Ncjd are stated to have been strained to the utmost by the recent inter necine wars, and Bin Saoud considers that the oases of Hassa and Katif were always the most profitable possessions of his Wahabee ancestors He is anxious, therefore, to recover the two districts, and he proposes that a secret under standing should be arranged between the British Government and himself, under which he should be granted British protection from Turkish assaults at sea, in the event of his ever succeed ing in driving the Turks, unaided, out of his ancestral dominions. In return for this protec tion the Amir is willing to bind himself to certain agreements (probably similar to those of the Trucial Chiefs), and to accept a Political Officer to reside at his Court. The details of this secret Treaty he wishes to be settled or discussed at an interview which he is ready to give me, either in person or with his brother representing him, at some convenient rendezvous in the desert. Bin Saoud is determined to make an effort to obtain possession of Hassa and Katif, for without the additional revenue which he can derive from these tracts he admits that he is unable to control the tribes who menace the highways of commerce and pilgrimage. He proposes, therefore, in the first place, to apply to the Sultan for the Mutasarrif-lik (Governorship) of the districts, and to throw off the Turkish yoke as soon as he considers the moment favour able after establishing himself. If his applieation is refused, he will invade the districts as soon as he is ready, and, having captured them, he will appeal openly to the British Government for protection. If he fails, he will never betray the secret understanding between himself and the Captain Prideaux to Major Cox, November 17, 190G.9 Government, Possibly he will not make his attempt even for four or five years more.’ , Major Cox to Government of India, November 24, 1906. Viceroy's te!egram. February 15,1907. In forwarding Captain Prideaux’s Report to the Government of India, Major Cox, in a letter dated the 24th November, 1906, urged the necessity of an “authoritative” reply being returned to the “ references made through the local officers by SheikJvMubarak of Koweit and Sheikh Jasim of Katr on behalf of Bin Saoud— references which have in no wav been courted, but which I cannot leave unanswered without incurring among the Chiefs concerned a reputa tion for personal negligence or discourtesy, which would be prejudicial to my work in other ways.” These papers were sent home for information in the ordinary course by the Government of India without comment in January 1907. In a telegram dated the 9th February, 1907, the Government of India were asked for an expression of their views as to the answer to be returned to Sheikh Jasim. They replied as follows on the 15th February :— “ ^ e are sending despatch reviewing situation in Eastern Arabia, and suggesting that answer be conveyed to Bin Saoud to the effect that British Government, while anxious to maintain friendly relations with him so long as he com ports himself in a manner consonant with British interests and our engagements with Arab Sheikhs on coast, see no necessity at present for making him any formal promises of the protection w hich might even have effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to consolidation of his authority. Answer might be conveyed orally through Sheikh Jasim or such other agency as our Resident in the Persian Gulf may recommend.” Government of ^,/-The promised despatch was sent on the February^, 1907. February, 1907. In it the Government of India reviewed the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to Nejd affairs since 1904. They expressed the view' that matters were rapidly approaching a crisis, which would compel us to make up our minds as to our policy towards Central Arabia. They considered the prospects of Turkey^ re-establishing her authority in Eastern Arabia1fi$M*emote, and even contemplated the prospect of the Turks dis appearing altogether from the whole of Arabia south of Zobehr. At the same time they held 610 that tlie establishment of the Wahabee power would be a menace to our position at Koweit as well as on the Pirate Coast. In regard to the question immediately at issue, they recommended that a reply should be returned to Bin Saoud’s overtures in the terms set forth in their telegram of the 15th Eebruary. Sir N. O’Conor, who was consulted, took the Sir N. O’Conor, view that it would be most unwise for His Apnl 190/ * Majesty’s Government to entangle themselves with Bin Saoud or in any other way io interfere in the internal affairs of Arabia. The reply of His Majesty’s Government to the Mr. Morley to Government of [ndia’s representations was con- ^^ nmelltof veyed in Mr. Morley’s despatch of the 3rd May, May 3, 1907. 1907, in the following terms :— “ After carefully considering, in consultation with His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constanti nople, the views expressed by you r Excellency’s Government as to the general situation in Central Arabia, His Majesty’s Government see no reason to modify the policy laid down in my predecessor’s telegram of the 30th Decem ber, 1904, and repeated in my telegram of the 9th November, 1900, that British interests and influence in those regions should be strictly confined to the co?.st ; and they agree with Sir N. O’Conor that it would be most unwise for them to entangle themselves with the Wahabee Amir or in any other way to interfere in the internal affairs of Arabia. . “ The terms of the reply, which in paragraph 11 of your letter you propose to return to Bin Saoud, appear to His Majesty’s Government to be open to objection, as implying an approval of the consolidation of the Wahabee power, and consequently a certain interference in Arabian affairs. No such communication should there fore be made. But if Major Cox finds it impossible to avoid giving some answer to those who have approached him on the Wahabee Amirs behalf, he should inform them, as Bin Saoud’s proposals involve considerations which it is impossible for His Majesty’s Government to maintain, that no reply is to be expected.” So far as is known. Bin Saoud’s advances were not renewed during the year 1907.
