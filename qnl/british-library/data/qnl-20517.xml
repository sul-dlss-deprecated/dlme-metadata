Mr .»/illiamson t s Political Kote on Q.atar„ .Tith reference to your telegram Ko.T/23, dated the 13th January 1934, I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a note by Mr.Williamson (Haji) of the A # 1 .0.0. Ltd., on n Qatar ' 1 , together with a Family Tree of the house of Ath Thani, dated the 14th January 19340. 2. Mr ^Williamson gave me his note in pencil, so I had it typed out for you, for convenience sake, together with 4 spare copies► 3. Mr♦Williamson*s note is a clear and accurate statement of fact and agrees with what I myself know of ^atar and its history* 4 # I did not know that the exact boundary line, as claimed by Ibn Thani ran as Mr •Williamson says it does: I was under the impression that it started from 3alwa fort, % and ran south to ANBAK wells and then turned due IHast to the Sea, south of the Khor ODAID. As Mr.Williamson knows the geography of ^atar far better than I do, I think we must assume that what he says in this matter is correct. 5. Incident/ally, and as I have already mentioned in another letter which I sent you sometime back, the existing Government map (Million 3heet) gives the depth oi the Bay of jalwa quite wrongly. It runs much further . tfurther south than marked^in tjpfe fact the true position of ^asr Salwa, is only a little north of an East and ./est line running through IChor al Odaid* The best existing map to consult that I know of is that prepared hy i^ir# Philby and which accompanies his book T T The Jmpty quarter' , although even he does not mention Jebel al NAKBH a conical hill a little north of ^asr oalwa^ # I understand also that Mr.Cox of the A # P # 0»C., Ltd.., was able to make a sketch map M the hinterland of Qatar, which could be studied with advantage. As regards the political situation existing bet ween His Majesty King Bin Jaud and the Ruler of '^atar: I agree' with every word that Mr .Williamson says, and it is borr&amp; out by what I have heard in Kuwait during the last year or so» In m^ opinion Bin ^aud deflni tely claims the '^atar peninsular, and will go on doing so, so long as we do not move with the times and adopt a policy there. All the in formation that I have been able to get from Riath, from time to time bears out exactly what Mr ..Williamson says in jl this respect. It is practically certain that Bin Saud warned the shaikh of Qatar on the latter*s recent visit to the Capital that he expected him to give any Oil Concession that might be going, to his friends, the .dmericans and not the British. He went, I believe, further, and told him, in a diplomatic way, of course, that only DOHAH could be con sidered as belonging to the Ibn THA1C£ , family and that the rest of the peninsular was his. Certainly all the Bedouins of Hassa look upon the ^atar desert {Bar al Qatr) as belong ing to Bin baud, and I only got this confirmed 3 days ago | i 15 # 1.54) by an ^.jman Shaikh, who is now in Kuwait. When I asked him guardedly, if he knew the boundary between ^audiyeh and the ohaikh of Qatar*s territory, he promptly replied, f *There is no boundary, Bin baud rules 'Bar al Qatr 1^atr , (the desert of ^atar) , and Ibn Ttiani rules Doha'. 7. Bin Saud's contention in the past has always been that he alone r^iles the Bedouin o/ Nomad elements in Arabia, for the simple reason that, as he says, only he can get at them and keep them quiet; hence all territory form ing the habitat of tf Nomad' Arabs he ipso facto claims to be his. 8# Bin Baud even went so far, some years ago, as to claim all ^raq nomad tribes, as well as all Kuwait Bedouins up to the walls of Kuwait, until the Ojair Qon- j.erence of 19ES put a definite boundary line between him and his northern neighbours and forced him to drop these ideas. To this day, however, in any public utterences he makes to his Nejd Bedouins, Bin baud tells them that all the Bedouin of ^.rabia (Badia) are his, and his neighbours only hold the Towns. This is a regular trick of his to gain their allegiance and impress. 9* As regards the question of ho?; to bring it home to Bin Saud that we consider ^at^r State to be independent o^ Saudi Arabia, and that we will not stand by and see Ibn Thani coerced in any way, where Oil or other questions are concerned: I do not consider the problem presents many difficulties, but we must tackle it at once , other wise the xjaericans will get into Q.atar for a certainty, and bhat principality will pass under the suzerainty of Bin Saud» 10 • In Wy opinion the procedure should be as follows: His Majesty's Government should without further delay add ress a friendly but firm note to Bin Saud embodying the following points:- (a) That he was definitely told by ^ir Percy v&gt;ox at Ojair in 19E3 (I was present at the interview) when Major Holmes tried to include Qatar in his Hassa Oil Concession with his. Bin- 4 - Bin SaucPs, approval, that ^atar was an indepen dent State under our protection^ (b) That he, Bin Saud, was further told by Sir Percy Cox that he had no rights in ^atar what soever and so could not give away what did not belong to him. (c) That as he never raised any objection at the time or since to Sir Percy Cox's pronounce ment, His Majesty's Government considered the matter as definitely settled, (d) That in view of His Majesty's Grovernment the time had now come to officially demarcate the frontier line as between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as had been done with Transjordan, 'Iraq and Kuwait and to that end invited him, Bin Saud, to admit the correctness of the boundary and Neutral Zone as claimed by the Ruler of qatar by an exchange of notes. 11. Bin Saud could reply in three ways. Either (a) he would agree out of hand, or (b) deny that Ibn Thani's boundary was the right one, and ask for a boundary com mission to fix the boundary: or (c) he would deny our right to interfere and claim the whole of Qatar as having come to him when he drove the Turks out of the Hassa Province, ^atar having wormed part of that province according to the Turks. &amp; In any case Bin Saud will have to show his hand and His Majesty s Government will know how to make the next move. I-, xt is of great importance that a copy of the letter which we send to Bin Saud, should be given to Ibn and that he be given to understand that we mean - siness ^nd that having settled his boundary officially ' th Bin U aud .^or him wo mean to assist him if necessary t0 a£;end it against all aggression. Ihis mustThis must be thoroughly got into his mind, and be backed hy a written promise on our part to afford suoh support, with the present development of our Air Force, there should be no difficulty in doing this* 13, Knowing Bin Saud as I do, I believe that when he is clearly made to realize that we intend to defend Qatar's land boundaries in case of necessity, he will ac cept the situation at once as he did in the case of ^rag and Kuwait. 14, //hat we must not do - and this is the crux of the whole matter - is to leave the situation as it is now f that is to say unsettled and in fluid state. If we do, the astute Bin Saud will at once take full advantage of our laissez faire attitude and by means of bluff and bombast where we are concerned, and by secret pressure and tribal rajHo into Q,atar (he denying responsibility all the time) where Ibn Thani is concerned, will gain all his points, and force Ibn Thani to acknowledge that he is the power that counts, and can do things, whilst His Majesty's Government is not, Ibn Thani will then, whilst outwardly 'keeping in 1 with us, surrender his hinterland to Bin Saud and give any Oil Concession that may be going to Bin Baud's proteges, the i^mericans, on the plea that theirs was the better offer, 15, Even if we are successful by diplomatic methods in keeping the Standard Oil of California out of Qatar, the Shaikh of that State will never give the concession to the I.P.G,, or A»P,0,C., unless we can give him an as surance that we intend defending his land frontiers, and will see him through any and every quarrel that Bin Saud may choose to pick with him in the future, 16, It should not be forgotten - and I state this as a well known and curious fact - that everyone of the Arabian Coastal Emirates in the Persian Gulf, have got it deeply fixed in their minds that in some way or other BinBin Saud can bring undue influence to bear on His Majesty's aovernment and get His Majesty's G-overnment to back him and settle any differences in his favour, if it is a case of Bin Saud or themselves• They are all suffering from a Bin Saud inferiority complex today, and we will not succeed in bettering matters, until we eradicate this idea and make them believe that we are prepared to stand by them, whatever form aggression from their 'big 1 brother takes* I have the honour to be.

They came from Central Arabia somewhere about the year 1750 A»D» and are Bin Tammim by descent• Of the family there are now sixty two males living. The paramount Shaikh is Shaikh Abdallah ibn 4asim ath-Thani. Shaikh Abdullah was made Ruler over the heads of his two elder brothers, Thani and lOialifah and his uncle Ahmad. This appointing the Ruler from a younger son seems to be a custom in the Thani family. Shaikh Abdullah has appointed his son Hamid over the elder brother Aly. Shaikh x^bdullah claims the whole of the ^atar peninsula bounded on the south west by a line drawn from MKHSH towards the East, al Gabal, «3adi al Gaiban to the Sabkhah, and coming out on the Jast coast on the northern shore of Khor ODAID. Beyond the frontier mentioned is a neutral zone of several miles in breadth, one part being bet -ween C^atar and the Oman tribes on the south east, and the other part being between ^atar and the Saudi territory on the south west. The Neutral Zone and the frontier between Q,atar and the Oman tribes is recognised by all, but that between Q.atar and the Saudi Government is only recognised as on sufferance from IBN SAUD. Ibn THANI is a merchant prince, he derives his power from wealth accumulated by his father and grand-father from pearling and trading. These xxrab merchant princes loe^ out ^money to their relations and to others who are settled in their district, collecting only a percentage on the profits and bearing the losses in most cases. In return ths receive the service and allegiance of these merchants, who are all more or less indebted to them. Ibn THANI other than the sixty odd members of his2 - own his/family, has no tribe which he can claim as his own in •^atar* There are a few scattered semi Nomads of the HAIK tribe on the peninsula dating back to the time of the BINI MUSLIM who were the rulers in ^.atar before the Thani family» Ibn 'JlL-d*! depends for his fighting force on men drawn from the 13LUX and the Bii.x kTJRRA^ two of the three tribes pasturing along the border of ^atar. The third tribe is al-mOHA^IR» Ibn THAIJI is definitely dependant on the good will of Ibn jaud and his HAS^x Governor, Ibn JALLOUI, for the safety of his lands from the raids of the Uejd tribes, especially from the MAB^SIR* I believe it irks Ibn THANI to be so much de pendant for his safety on ibn ^aud, but to strengthen himself by hiring a body of mercenaries from the tribes of BINI Ha^fcTAR and AL MUEEA, other than the few dozen men he has at present, would cost him much and more than he coulc' well afford. The income of Ibn THAMI, as I have said before, is derived from pearling, and from monies lent out to traders on the !t perceiita^0 from tho profit ' basis. This percentage varies from 5 yo to 25 /*♦ Generally if on the 5 &gt; from the trader makes good any losses from the capital lent; but if on the 25 ^ basis the lender suffers any legi timate loss to the capital. Ibn THA1TI draws a small income from Dohah Customs but not enough to cover the upkeep of the Government and lown guards. Customs charged are 4 / j ad valorem. No income is desived from the grazing and the Bedouin tribes of BENT HAIIAH, MUiLu-i., and LAWASIR graze as they wish, except in one or two areas, which are set aside for the herds of Ath Thani. The towns of ^atar are as follows: 011 1:110 We st coast WMBA governed by the sonssons of Abdur Rahman. DOFAH , the Capital. Here the Ruler has a large castle, but spends most of his time at RIYAN, where he has a garden. RIYAN, about eight miles inland from DOEaH, has very sweet and plentiful water at a depth of about 5 ft. Host of the Bedouin Fidawi of Xbn THANI live at RIYAN. BHAJAIN, Ruled by Shaildi j ± LY and his sons. Shaikh Aly will take no customs dues from his people, nor money from the divers. UIO-i GL IvLHjiiiDImjjAK. This Town has a G-overnor elected by the Thani family. The towns at the northern point and east coast are all (so they claim) independent of the THANI family, paying no taxes nor customs and appointing their own Governors. The principal of these are ROU'US ABU ADH DHOHIF and ASHAIRIJ. ZUBARA was at one time larger even than DOHAH with whom it was constantly at war. It is now a ruin without one inhabitant. Ibn THANI, during the Turkish regime held the title of ^AIMAKAM and Qatar came under the MUTASARIFIAH of HA3SA. At one time he drew a small subsidy from the Turks. 4. IQ^ITIGN wJ-TK u-0 Ibn THANI., as I have mentioned is dependent on the good will of the Saudi G-ovemment for the safety of his state from Bedouin raids. Lately when he visited Ibn Saud at Riyadh, it is said that he was told that Qatar was part of the Saudi Kingdom, and that he only held DOHAH, and the adjoining towns on sufferance of Ibn Saud, also that the Saudi Government looked upon the idea of a British company having an oil concession in Qatar with disfavour and if anyone was to be given a concession in Qatar it must be the Americans. The foregoing is the least Ibn Saud was reportedreported to have said to Ito TLl ^ I . It is almost certain In view of Ibn Saud's claim ove r Ibn THAffl and ^atax that if Ibn TMNI is allowed to rfve the oil concession to the Americans, it will he tanta- mount to aclcnowledgins Ibn baud's definite suzerainty over Q^atar • If Ibn THMI were promised protect ioia o 0 Ms country from Ibn Saud and especially from raids from the ^ Bedouins on his borders. I ^ feel that he would be incline in fact be very glad to be an Independent ruler and to be m a position to act as he thought fit with regards to the concession, especially as under the present circumstances, ao matter to whom Ibn mUX gives the concession Ibn Saud will expect a large share of the proceeds for protecting ^atar from his own Bedouins. 3d.

As regards the survey which our Geologists (Messrs.

I also enclose all relevant extracts on this matter from their renort. I have telegraohed to London asking them to give a similar man to the India Office at your request. Further to my letter No.GF/1354 of 6th January, J have now received further details from my London Princinals regarding H.M.G's prooosals that we should make a Commercial Agreement with the Shaikh and a Supplementary Agreement (covering all political issues) with and no doubt you will have already received similar details. Discussions are going on as to how such a procedure can be nut into nractice, but meanwhile 1 have received the latest draft (dated 2/1/34) of our original nro- posals to the Shaikh, now re-christened.^Commercial Agreement', a copy of which I also enclose ^or your information. It contains a number of amendments pronosed by the India Office, but I gather that further points yet remain to be discussed. Col. T.C.,if.Fowle, C.B.E., The Hon'ble The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.Movements: The writers of this report landed from g , s. Khu zl stan at Do hah on 3rd February, where they were met by Haji A.F.Williamson. From the 5th until the 14th February the eastern side and northern end of the peninsula were examined from Dohah and a camn at A1 Ga'ara. On the 16th camp was moved to Sabsab from where the southern parts of the territory were examined. On the 26th February the base camp was again moved to Khirsa'at al Bahadh and on the 4th March to Nasraniya. From these two camps the westerly and central oarts of the peninsula were dealt with. On 8th March the oarty returned to Dohah, from where a few further local trips were made to comolete the reconnaissance, and on the 13th March left by launch for Bahrain Island. Only in the southern parts of the territory, was the work in any way hampered by political circumstances. Shaikh Abdullah refused to allow the party to camn even for a single night at any point south of Sabsab. He was also particularly insistent that his South em boundary '(as outlined on Plate I) should not be crossed at anv' time, m^'re 'especlally^la'thp neighbourhood of Salwa, where a representative of Ibn Saud's Government is stationed. These restrictions arose from a very natural desire on the part of Shaikh Abdullah to avoid any complication with neighbour states through a possible 'incident' occurring in the somewhat lawless border zone. In other respects, the Shaikh gave the party complete freedom to visit any part of his territory. M ap and 3ect ions : The sketch map on Plate I is based on the outline given in the War Office Map of Asia on 1 : 1,000,000 scale, with alternations and additions controlled by the traverses made during this survey. The coastline from Odaid northwards to Ras Rakan and thence west and south to Fahahil (near Zubara), as shown on the Jar Office map, agreed tolerably well with our traverses except in the neighbourhood of Dha'ain and Khor al Mohander. South of Fahahil as far as Dohat al Hussain our observations diverged to some extent from the outline given on the map. Unfortunately, during our visits to the neighbourhood of Dohat Faishakh visibility was poor and we could not get as many control bearings as could be desired. The map on Plate I is, therefore, open to question in this area. The shape of the coastline from Ras Abaruk southwards to Salwa has been drawn entirely from our traverses and differs radically from the War Office or any other map we have seen of the peninsula. Positions of inland places are based entirely on our traverses and differ widely from the 1 : 1,000,000 map.2nd Januairrf^lQ- QATAR . COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT.

During my whole talk the Shaikh was remarkably communicative, probably because of the fact that the trying Hamadhan fast was to end the next day. In any case he spoke more freely on Oil matters than he had done for many months. I started the t ball rolling* by enquiring if he had ever heard of one LIr.Abdul Ghani ft Adlabi of Manchester (not Ydlibi as mentioned in Foreign Office letter referred to above). The Shaikh immediately replied that he knew all about the pesrson. He was a well known Syrian who had adopted European ways of living.- 2 - ^Ir.Adliabi had large 'business connections in India, -igypt and Turkey and had of late years supplied His Majesty King Bin Saud with much of his 'Stores' requirements, both, military and civil and only recently had purchased tents for his Asir campaign. The King was under a great debt to Mr.Adlabi, added the Shaikh, literally and metaphorically, and in order to show his gratitude arid no doubt to prevent him presenting his 'Bills' prematurely, was reported to have appointed him his accredited Agent to daal witli any Oil «eHee«s4e companies, who might be desirous of getting fur ther concessions in Saudi Arabia (exclusive of Hassa)• On my enquiring from where he, the Shaikh, had got his information, he replied, 'from Mohamed 'latim and quite recently'. This latter person, as you know, is Major Holmes 1 'jackal' and visited Egypt in December last, where I strongly suspect that he met his employer and received instructions for a new campaign in Kuwait. 4 # I next made a guarded reference to Q.atar and enquired from the Shaikh how he thought the A.P.O.G. were getting on in their negotiations with Shaikh Abdulla ibn Thani. The Shaikh smilingly replied that although he did not like to state it as a 'positive fact', all news and other indications that reached him from Riath showed that f Bin Saud had definitely warned the Shaikh of Q,atar that he I was not at liberty to give any sort of Oil Concession to I the A.B.OoG. or other British concern, and that if he had | the temerity to do so, it would be. at his peril. He, the | Shaikh, believed the above to be the true facts of the ease, l| . and as far as he was concerned he was (luite certain that | the A.P.O.C, would fall to get the concession they were after , and that the next step would he that Bin Saud would inform. | the Shaikh of iiatar that he must give Oil Concession to his I proteges, the Standard Oil Company of California, (In thisyj 9 !vi mis oonnection see my despatch C-17, dated the 18th January). His jUxcellency then went on to say that this • unsatisfactory situation was entirely due to our failure to .instil a ^ feelin^ of confidence ** into the mind of the Shaikh of v ^atar. The latter clearly (and the sams, said the Shaikh, applied to every other Shaikh on the xxrab Coast) felt today that we (Hick Majesty* 5 Government) were a ^broken reed** and not to he relied on* talked a great deal about the importance of treaties where they affected her own interests, but apparently were not out to remember our obligations to our friends who were in treaty relations with us, Mien strcmg persons like Bin Saud, who we wanted to keep in v/ith, exerted pressure on them* The latter had only to bully and threaten, and his victims despairing of getting any but verbal backing from us, whom they looked to for active support, naturally took the line of least re- si stence, and secretly agreed with Bin Saud to do all he asked of theyx. This, of course, entirely suited the King , s policy. He did not coioe out into the open and so had no occasion to cross swords with His Majesty's Grovernment. I next enquired from His Excellency how he would deal with ftatar sk situation if he himself had the managing of ity His reply rwas quick and to the point: 'I should immediately warn Bin Saud that Q,atar was entirely independent of Saudi Arabia and under my protection only; that I considered the boundaiy to be so and so, between the two States, and that being the case, he. Bin Saud, should be careful to see that none of his Bedouin tribes committed any acts of aggression against ^atar territory'. Bin Saud, said the Shaikh, would perfectly well understand the threat behind such letter* • n At the same time Tt , added His ICxcellen- cy, 'I would send a copy of my letter to the Shaikh of Q.atar^atar and inform Mm that in future I would assist him to defend his land frontiers against aggression from all comers and would give him a letter to that effect. I would then remind him that 'by his treaty with me he could give no Oil Concession to any one whom I disapproved of. This is how I would act and this is how His Majesty's G-overnment ought to act, if she wants to save ftatar. A laissez faire attitude will no longer do'* ^You must at all costs', added the Shaikh, 'show Ibn Thani that you mean to be his friends, and give him proper support against the King, and you must do so quickly; half measures will not do'. 5 # As the Shaikh said all this I wondered how far he intended to read me r a parable* where his own state was concerned, so taking a shot at random, I asked whatwas there to prevent Bin oaud trying his ^atar game on the Kuwait Neutral ^one• The Shaikh replied quickly that he did not think the King would or could do so without first debouncing the whole 'Neutral ^one Agreement 11 , to himself and to His Majesty's Government jointly. He relied on His Majesty's Government to see that Bin Saud did not do this, or start trifling in the matter. I asked him if he had anymen or retainers camped in the Kuwait Neutral Zone to give him early news should any American geologists suddenly motor across its oorder and begin prospecting.

We have sent a copy of it to the Government of India and to Busliire and will bear in mind what you say when it comes to detailed negotiations with any oil concessionaire. B. The question of extending our liabilities in respect of protection against external aggression to which you refer in paragraph 3 is of course rather a large one, and I do not think that at the moment there is any question of facing the important issue of policy which it involves. But we note that in any case even if His Majesty's Government were to favour at some time in the future the giving of a guarantee against external aggression in Q.atar it would not necessitate the provision of landing grounds additional to those mentioned in paragraph 2 of your letter. 3. We will bear in mind the point in paragraph 5 of your letter with regard to wireless telegraphy.

It may interest you to know that the H.A.F. Intelligence Officer for the Gulf (F/O. Coats) has recently asked Ghisholm for general information about Qatar, notably the disposition of its tribes and boundaries; and also suggested that he might accompany him on his next visit to Qatar to obtain information il at first hand. 7ith the former reouest we are glad to comply lias far as we can, but as regards the latter Ghisholm had to r point out the possibility of such joint visits giving an | undesirably political complexion to our commercial activities. ' I merely mention this as I do not know how far the R.A.F. Intelligence combine with your own department in the Gulf. In any case, I understand F/O. Coats will be too occupied, further South to explore Qatar for some months, and then he seemed to think that it would be simple to visit it at any time by flying !k h hoat.

Petroleum Department India Office. i &gt; I. Bahrein Oil. (1) The meeting after discussion of the line to he taken in the'light of the telegram No.606, dated 19th December 1933 from the Political Agent, Bahrein, (copies circulated under P.S.8165/33) on the subject of the intentions of the Bahrein Petroleum Company as regards local refining, concurred in a draft of instructions to the Political Resident (despatched as India Office telegram 3173, of 22nd December).■ (2) Mr .Laithwaite briefly explained the latest developments in connection with the request oi the Bahiein Petroleum Company for the assistance of H.M.G. in surveying, buoying and lighting certain approaches to Bahrein m connection with the shipment of oil w.n by them. As the result of discussion at the Admiralty it had heai thought 'better, in the interests of avoiding any excuse for the introduction of U.S. naval personnel to conduct surveys, etc. : and of keeping control of any lighting and buoying arrangements | in British hands, to give the Company all possible assistance ^ •n a repayment basis. It was now proposed, aft.r aiscussion with the Company's representatives, to invite the Government of | . x- « 4-^ -n-nrtprtake the necessary , 1 India, if they saw no objection, ^ work,/ ■ Iwork, on a repayment basis so that full control for any buoys laid would be secured to Government. The Company had intimated that the Standard Oil Company of California had placed an expert party at their disposal who would arrive in London from the U.S.A. on 4th January en route for Bahrein to deal with the question of the laying of the proposed submarine pipeline and the connected questions of laying moorages and floats. The meeting took note of the position^ II. Q.atar Oil Concession* The meeting resumed consideration of the revised oil concession communicated informally by the A.FoO.C. on 11th December 1933, in the light of the record of the discussion which had taken place with the representatives ol the Company on 14th December&gt; (P.Z.8212/33)* Mr«Laithwaite said that the A.P.O.C. were pressing for the earliest possible indication of any amendments that H.M.G. might desire, in the interests of facilitating Mr.Chisholm's negotiations in Qatar, and had been anxisasfor information before Christmas. That was impossible, but it seemed desirable to let them have a letter early next »eeJc, The meeting agreed. It was agreed that it would be best first to consider the general procedure to be adopted in negotiating with the Company and the Sheikh; secondly, the supplementary amendments, if any, to be suggested to the Company in Articles of the revised draft concession other than Article 1 , thirdly, Article 12 and the connected questions of British control, exclusive British exploitation of any concession granted (though this point strictly arose on Article 17), and the maintenance of a British Chief Local Representative Company in Qatar. The India Office wished c ^StWo; 3. consideration in this connection of certain special restrictions, arising out of political conditions in Qatar, which would apply to all Corapanies applying for concessions whatever their nationality. III. A« Procedure. On the question of pr ocedure, Mr .Lait hwaite said that as the A.P.O.C. were apparently willing to cover certain pointe of special interest to H.M.O. in an exchange of letters (which must of course 'be of a character binding on the Company and on any transferees or assignees), the simplest course, in the light of previous informal discussion with the Foreign Office, and subject to the views of the meeting, appeared to be that there should he: (a) an agreement between the Company and the Sheikh which should be purely commercial in character, possibly on the general lines of the revised draft concession which the C»,.n, had no. submitted, .ttn auoh modification of Artlol. 12 and such minor amendments in other axuicles as *g thought necessary; („) . subsidiary os.-e,n»..t det.een tie A.P.O.C. and H .M.O. to cover matters of Interest primarily to H.M.O. and tl» Company, ^ qhPikh. or to the Company and the rather than to H.M.G* and the Sheikh, and xo deal essentially with political points, agreement, which should be binding not only on the Company,^ hut on any assignee or transferee company, could be elther ** exchange of letters or a formal agreement, perhaps preteza the latter. The Company at the discussion on 14th Decern e had indicated their readiness to deal with certain p this character in an exchange of letters. Such an o o- qafetmards for aerodromes s2 n agreement could cover, e.g. &amp;ai g seaplane bases, safeguards for wireless and other ^ communications, undertakings by the Company that they p ^°/i pay due deference to the advice of our political representatives and the views of t he Sheikh, possibly (a point to he discussed later in connection with Article 12 of the revised draft Concession), exclusive British exploitation of any concession, the appointment of a British Chief Local Representative, etc. Apart from the points covered 'by (a) and ('b), closer examination of the problem had shown that the grant of any oil concession 'by the Sheikh, whether to the A.P.O.C-., the I.P.O., or an American Company, would give rise to difficult political problems in connection with jurisdiction over the concessionnaire 1 s employees, the grant of protection by H.M.G. in cases in which local conditions made this necessary and the Sheikh for any reason failed to afford it, and, probably, the appointment of a Political Agent to represent H.M.G-* and would make it necessary to consider bringing into iorce certain articles of the Sheikh t s Treaty of 1916 which were at present dormant* Such questions could best be dealt with in a third agreement or exchange of letters between the Sheikh and Considerable difficulty might be anticipated in disposing of them: and if we were to take them up with the Sheikh and try to 'reach a general understanding with him on political points, it might be thought desirable to take the opportunity a ^ so secure the air facilities in Qatar which the Sheikh had hitherto refused to give save in return for guarantees of protection which H .M .G. were not prepared to undertake. Mr.Rendel said that, speaking personally, he was entirely in favour of a procedure such as had been desciibe Higher authority at the Foreign Office had not of coui se ye consulted. But action on these lines would, he ^as confident, be consistent with their general view/■5. vie^y as at present advised: which was that, so long as the interests of H.M.G* and of the Sheikh were adequately safeguarded nothing should 'be done which would tend to hamper the conclusion of an agreement between the Sheikh and the A.P.O.C. in the immediate future. Delay would inevitably increase the risk that the Standard Oil Company of California might actively interest themselves in obtaining the concession. Were they once to enter the field, they could rely on the active support of the U.S. Government, and however strong the case on merits for any special conditions which H.M.G. might be anxious to secure in respect of British control, British exploitation, British local representation &amp;c., we should almost certainly find it much more difficult to have our way on such points when dealing with a wholly foreign company backed by the U.S. Government than when dealing with a company such as the Iraq Petroleum Company in which there was a substantial British element. The procedure proposed, with an important proviso which the foreign Office had already recommended to the India Office, iwould make it possible for the A.P.O.C. to pursue negotiations immediately with the Sheikh with a view to reaching agreement on commercial points, - such an agreement to contain no clauses of apolitical character such as provision for jurisdiction &amp;c. While those negotiations were in progress, we could separately discuss with the Company the points to be covered in the proposed Agreement between the Company and H.M.G. : while the local political authorities, after consultation with H.M.G. and the Government of India, could press on with a settlement of the points in issue between H .M.G, and the Sheikh. The proviso to ^ihich he had referred, and which if accepted should fully safeguard the special interests of H .M.G., was that a clause should be inserted in any commercial agreement between the ^P.O.C. and the. Sheikh to the effect that the Agreement could not/i; 6. not come into force until the consent of H.M.G. had been obtained to its provisions.. Such a clause merely reaffirms d the Slieildi's existing treaty obligations and ought not therefore to cause difficulty vdth him. Vis-a-vis the Company it would empiiasise the special position of H.M.G. in the matter. Mr. Rendel added that in his view it ^ould be desirable that the conditions to be laid down, in respect of British control and exploitation of any concession, in whatever form they might emerge as a result of discussion by higher authority, and if necessary of reference to the Cabinet, should be conditions which would apply not merely to a British concessionaire but to any other Company, of whatever nationality, which might endeavour to secure a concession in Qatar. We had not yet thought out in detail at what conditions it would be desirable to aim, the questions involved were difficult and would need careful consideration, and it might therefore be impossible at once to inform the A.P.O.G. what precisely the conditions would oe. iiat so long as their general outline could be communicated to the Company without delay, and the Company given to understand tnat whatever detailed conditions were finally laid down would be of universal application, it ought considerably to reduce their difficulties in negotiating either with the SheiMi or with the I.P.C. Mr. Seal said that, so far as he could judge, the Admiralty on the understandings stated by Mr• Rendel, Wvr^ unlikely to object to the procedure suggested. He thought that it ms essential that the main lines of the agreement with should be ccrumunicated to the Company in the. ve 4 ry neat .wut-u in order to avoid any suggestion that the Company had ~een allowea to proceed with the commercial agreement with the Sheikh 011 false pretences; also that if any difficult/ were experienced/A* 1 7 erienoed in getting the SUeikh to agree to our terras it would inroortant to devise some means of avoiding the impression that pressure vyas 'being brought to 'bear upon him in tlis interests of the A^i^OeG. Mr, Laithwaite said that the India Office fully agreed with the proviso to which Mr. Rendel had referred, to which they attached great importance. As regards the conditions to te laid dovm, he thought that it would be well to give tiae Company a fairly clear idea of the nature of the safeguards, etc., which His Majesty's Government would he likely to require when we informed them next week of our comments on the revised draft agreement generally. It was obviously essential that they should have this information before they concluded any agreement with the Sheikh, even if such an agreement covered commercial points only and oonoained the proviso which had been discussed. It mould not be overlooked that the A.P.O.C. could not conclude any agreement with the Sheikh without the approval of the 1.2.0. and that it might well be that safeguards such as we had in view might be of great importance from the I.P.O. standpoint. Mr; Starling said that we must take care that the minimum safeguards etc. which we might pj-eociice, should n such as to be impossible for the A.P.O.C. acting as they would be on behalf of the I.P.C. to accept. We must not overlooK: that, whatever the justification for them, if the conditions laid down by H.M.G. were too stiff, the I.P.C. might be unwilling to take up, or to proceed with negotiations for, a concession, they were themselves unwilling to take it up a position mignt arise where the A.P.0.0. could not take it up independently. If that happened we might find ourselves confronted immediately with the Standard Oil of Californiai He drew attention to the general principles which had been laid down by the Oabine govern/8. govern the grant of oil concessions in British territory aad tiie conditions to be satisfied in tiie case of sucii concessions, ITiie most important of these vjere: (1) Registration in British territory; (2) Majority of Employees and if possible Managing Director to be British subjects; (3) 50$ of produce to be refined on British territory, and the oil to be suitable for Adrni r alt y use; (4) pre-emption in time of war, Mr, Laithyyaite pointed out that the decision in quest ion had had in viev^i British territory only. Qatar mm not British territory, nor a British protectorate. It was an independent Arab State in special treaty relations with H.M.G. The vievy that the Cabinet decision referred to did not cover the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, had consistently been held by the India Office in the inter departmental discussions which had taken place in connection vdth the Elovjeit oil concession, Mr, Rendel agreed and suggested that it had been accepted at the time of the assignment to American interests of the Bahrein oil concession that oil concessions to be granted in the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf must oe dealt with separately and on their merits. It would be necessary to consider in the case of Qatar whether the conditions laid down by the Cabinet to apply in the case cf concessions in British territory or more stringent conditions, and if so whet, should apply, Mr. Starling/9. Mr .Starling , reverting to his previous remarks, enquired whetheri if we so stiffened up our conditions that the I.P.O. dropped out, we should feel quite sure that we could impose the same conditions on an American Company, e.g. the Standard Oil Canpany of California. Mr-Laithwaite said that he thought our general view was that such conditions as may he laid down should apply to any Canpany, whether British or foreign. The two important points were control and exploitation; and it would have to he decided what our minimum requirements in respect of them were to he. If H.M.G. decided to lay down the principle that hoth control and exploitation must be British, whatever might he the nationality of the Company ultimately controlling the concession, and we could secure acceptance of these terms from any concessionaire, so much the better. If it proved impossible in practice to go so far, and to secure effective British control, then we ought as a minimum to require that local representation and exploitation should he in British hands. ^e could make a good case for this on the ground of the special local political difficulties of Qatar, where we should he dealing with a State with ill-defined boundaries, a backward and scattered population, hitherto little in touch with the outside world, and not easily susceptible to pressure by H.M.G. The Sheikh was precluded by his treaty engagements from dealings with foreign pov.ers engagements to which it was regarded as desirable to hold him. If foreign subjects were massacred in Qatar hy a tribal uprising or the likei, responsibility for securing effective punishment would thus fall on H.K.G. , and her as in dealing with air procedure we might reasonaDly take the line that while we were prepared to face certain political/rvl 0 10. -political difficulties where our own nationals were concerned, we were not prepared to in the case of foreigners. On the face of it, too, we had a good answer to any American complaint that such conditions represented a refusal to maintain an open door policy in oil matters in the Gulf. The Truciai Coast was closed to all concession hunters, whether British or foreign. The Bahrein oil concession had already teen reassigned, with our approval, to American interests; and the latest information was that in Koweit, in which American interests had teen allowed full liberty to compete, we should in future be dealing with an Anglo-American combine. Our excuse for restricting exploitation in Qatar to British personnel would be the special political difficulties presented by that area. Mr.Starling said that it was relevant, so far as the nationality of exploiting personnel was concerned, that Ibn Saud had agreed that the concession granted in Hasa to the Standard Oil of California should be operated by American personnel. Mr.Bendel said that the question of nationality of the exploiting personnel and of the safeguards would clearly have to be considered separately, but from the foreign Office standpoint it would be easier to impose terms in respect of these on the I.P.O. than on a purely American Company, such as the Standard Oil Company. Mr-Seal said that the question of safeguards for pre-emption would probably be regarded as more important from the Admiralty standpoint if the Qatar concession were to go to a U.S.Conpany than if it went to the X.P.C. The fact to be faced was that the Admiralty must, have t..e oil in War, and if the Company were American certain diplcmatic difficulties might arise which would be ve y much/| 04' 11. much more easily handled if the agreement provided for preemption. Mr .Laithwaite said that the A. P. O.C. had been warned in the meeting on 14th December that in the event of their failing to secure the concession, or of competing interests entering the field, HM.G. must not be regarded as permanently committed to approval of whatever terms they might in present conditions thini: suitable in the case of the A. P. O.C. We could if necessary endeavour to make special provision in such circumstances for pre-emption. Mr.Rendel regarded it as of great importance that any conditions made by H.M.G. regarding safeguards, British control, pre -emption etc., should be of universal application. He thought that if we demanded certain conditions from the A.P.O.C.or I.P.C., but demanded different or stiffer conditions from a purely U.S. Company, our international position would be much more difficult, since the U.S.Government would certainly accuse us of differentiation. If, on the other hand, we could work out conditions which would be applicable universally - Quite irrespective of the nationality of the concessionary Canpany and could be defended on merits in view of the political situation, our hands would be much strengthened in dealing with possible eventual representations of the U.S. or any other foxtign Government. Mr.Laithwaite expressed agreement as regards the importance of making our conditions universally applicable. He asked what importance was attached to a special safeguard for refining locally ? Mr.Rendel said he had the impression that the a. P.O.C. would object to being required to refine in Q.atar. Mr.Starling suggested that they might be asked to agree to refine in Qatar or in British territory, and this was agreed. After further discussion it was agreed ,subjeot to the approval of higher authority, (a) to accept in principle the procedure suggested at the opening of the meeting: M that a letter (to be concurred in by the Departments conoe.rned)1%. concerned) should be sent 'by tine India Office to Mr.Hearn in the course of next week, suggesting in the first place the adoption of the procedure which had been discussed as between the Sheikh and the Conpany, and the Company and secondly, recording the ooints on which a,greement had been reached or which had been raised but not disposed of in the discussions with Mr.Eraser and Mr .Hearn on 14th December; thirdly, indicating in general terms the nature of the points (including safeguards &amp;c. ) which H.M.G, would dssire to see covered in the proposed subsidiary agreement between the Company and themselves. It would be desirable, in dealing with this last point, not to intimate a decision to the Gcmpany. The points in question were controversial and - the risk apart of deterring the A.P.C.C. from proceeding with negotiations if they were started in too categorical terms at this stage - it might be some time before H. M. G-» had themselves reached decisions on them. It would probably therefore be preferable to indicate them in outline and say that a more detailed statement would follow; that we should be prepared to discuss them further with the Company if necessary later, but that in the interest of clearing the ground for their comnercial negotiations with the Sheikh, we thought it undesirable to postpone ccmmunication of our comment on the draft agreement and on the question of procedure until the special desiderata of H.M.G. had been more fully elaborated. B. Amendments in Revised Draft Concession., The meeting then considered and approved tne amendments which had been provisionally agreed or raised on 14th December with Mr.Fraser and Mr.Hearn in the a rticles of the revised draft other than Article 12 ; an d reached agreement as to the supplementary points to 136 raised with the A.P. O.C. on the articles in question. (These are set out in the enclosure to the draft letter to/f ^ Vl') ^ 13. to the Ocmpany attaohed). Subject to their acceptanoe and to a satisfactory solution of the problems raised bv Article 12, the meeting agreed that the revised draft concession which had been submitted by the A.P.O.C. was generally suitable. It may be recorded that a point raised for the first time in connection with the draft Agreement which gave rise to considerable discussion was that of the definition of the Sheikh's dominions in Article 2 (c). The Southern and Western frontier of Qatar is at present somewhat indeterminate. At the same time it is important that there should be no risk of Ibn Saud being given an opportunity to call in question the line established by the unratified Anglo Turkish Convention of 29th July, 1913, i.e.. a line running from the coast just east of Uqair due South to parallel 20 North, on the Eastern boundary of Ncjd. If a map is attached to, or a definition included in, the concession, it will be necessary either to include in or to omit from Qatar as shown on the map or in the definition the territory between the various frontiers of Tatar as described in the Political Residents .Despatch No. 41 of 24th June, 1933, to the Colonial Office,(P.Z«4642/3S) ^ ' and the 1913 imglo Turkish lino, and this would inevitably lead to friction and controversy, particularly in view of the fact that the Standard Oil Company of California are now operating on the Hasa Coast. It was agreed therefore that it would be better to omit the map from the concession I. and to leave the definition as vague as possible, at any rate pending the further report on the whole question which is awaited from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The position could be frankly explained to the A»P«0• C*,/ C./&lt;r-yH 14. C. Article 12 and connecteii Questions . Tiie meeting then turned to consider Article 12 and the questions arising out of it. it was agreed that these were; (a) British control; (to) Position ana nationality of Chief Local Hepresentative; (c) Nationality of exploiting personnel; (d) pre-emption and refining arrangements. The discussion on points (h), (c) and (d) may he briefly summarised as follows:- (b) Position ana nationality of chief ^ocal HepresentativeT It was very Important, particularly so long as there was no resident Political Officer, that he should (as in Bahrein) be a British subject whose appointment should be approved by H.L.G., aiu that he should be persona grata to H.M.G. It would be desirable also that if and when a Political Agent was appointed, transactions between the I Company and the Sheikh shoula be dealt with through the Political Agent. The Company haa suggested that it might be easier to secure our desiderata under this head if we expressed them as a wish rather than a demand. But the point seemed too important to leave open in this way. (c) Nationality of employees . The case on merits for requiring that, whatever the ultimate control and nationality of any Company operating an oil concession in Qatar, local exploitation (and representation) should in present conditions be wholly British, had already been developed in the discussions above on procedure. It was agreed that a ruling would nave to be sought on the difficult points it raised, pending which we could not commit ourselves to it as a ■^S_UU8 : _non in writing to the Company: but that our lett' shoula refer in general terms to the probability of such a rs( 4Uireffient. (d)// 15. (a) pre-eniption and Local iteflnlriK . It was agreed that an understanding as to the right of pre-emption in time of war was desirable and that this should he indicated to the Company. As regards refining they should he informed that it was regarded as important that oil won should be refined either in :4atar or in British territory ana that they should be asked for an assurance on this. r Ihs possibility of Karachi was mentioned. (a) British Control . Bae meeting considered the tentative redraft of Article 12 which had been put forward by Mr. Hearn at the meeting on 14th December. The effect was to secure that any company to which the concession might be transferred would be a British Company, registered in Great Britain, having its principal place of business in Great Britain, and with a British subject at all times as Chairman, but to give any such company the right to form subsidiaries unasr its own control to work the concession which, while enjoying the rights and accepting the obligations of the parent company under the Agreement, would be under no restriction as regards nationality or British control. It ms agreed that the first paragraph of the redraft was unobjectionable so far as it went. The second faragraph was unobjectionable if the words 'except the engagements expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause' were omitted. There would be no objection, if the Company thought this would facilitate negotiations with the sheikh, to leaving the question of Britisn control out of the coronercial agreements to be negotiated between them and the/16. tlie Sielkh altogether, so long as it agreed, with the A .P.O.C. that provisions to govern it satisfactory to K.M.G. would he Included in the separate agreement to be negotiated between H.M.G. and the Company. It was generally felt, and ter. starling in particular emphasised that the #0»0», negotiating as they must as agents of the I.P.O., might find considerable difficulty in accepting in respect of subsiaiary companies British control provisions such as were embodied in Ivir. Hearn's redraft of sub-paragraph 1 of article 12 in respect of a transferee company. In this connection kr. otarling considered that the British control element in any assignee or subsidiary company would not be less, and from what Mr, Fraser had said on 11th December there was a prospect that it might be considerably more than that in the I.P.C. He was averse from asking in these conditions for a formal guarantee that it should be as large as possible and in no circumstances less than that in the I.P.C., and it was decided not to pursue this suggestion. Mr. starling said that the points of real Importance to us were, he thougbt, local exploitation by British personnel, the right of pre-emption in time of war, and the refining of any oil won either in Qatar or in British territory. The representatives of the Admiralty and trie Foreign Office suggested, after further discussion, that even if we could persuade A.P.O.C. and the I.P.C. to agree that any subsidiary company should be registered and have its principal place of business in Great Britain, and a British Chairman, the control/vn 17 control which this would secure to us might not in practice prove very substantial, and that as our essential desiderata were those which had been mentioned Dy Mr. Starling, it might be that in trie long run we should find it simplest to agree with the Company not to press the British control clause on the -understanding that they would meet us fully as regards our other desiderata. Mr. nd81 pointed out in particular that if we could secure our main desiderata by other means, it might well be bad tactics to insist on the strict application of the British c ontrol provisions to subsidiary companies - since tnis might only lurther complicate the already delicate position of tne A.r'#0»C# an the Board of the I.P.O. - while it would probably be possible in practice to secure by other means that subsidiary companies were under the adequate control of their parent companies. Questions connected with the •registration ana nationality of subsidiaries were often based on technical and financial considerations regarding taxation etc. and it did not follow that the non- application of the British control provisions to subsidiaries would in fact mean that those subsidiaries would escape from British control. It was finally agreed that in the letter to be sent to the Company our desiderata should be indicated in general terms and that a door should be left open j.or the Company to come back, on the ground that it would oe unfortunate if, on hearing what our desiderata were, they decided that it would be useless to proceed with their negotiations, secondly that while the terms to be used woula require careful consideration we might hint that H.ivi.G. as at present advised would require British control clauses/•18. clauses in respect of subsidiary companies of the nature ecibodied in sub-clause 1 of Jar. Hearn's tentative redraft of Article 12, together with an understanding as to British exploitation and the position of the Chief Local Representative, the right of preemption in time of war, and the refining of oil won either locally or in British territory. If as the result of further discussion we were to secure the Company's agreement to British exploitation una representation and an understanding as regards preempt in in time of war, the question of refining might assume less importance anu need not be pressed.

With reference to your letter P.Z.8215/23 of the 21st December 1953, the Air Ministry are not at present greatly concerned regarding air facilities on the QATAR PENINSULA owing to its close proximity to BAHREIN, and the present arrangements, under which the Sheikh has 'been warned that he will have to account in the event of occupants of an aircraft which may have a forced landing coming to any harm, should meet our requirements for the time being. 2. It is desirable, however, that in due course we should have an emergency landing ground either at DOHA or in the vicinity of DOHA FAISH SHAKE where air reconnaissance has indicated it might be possible to establish a landing ground. As far as can be foreseen at present it does not seem that we are likely to require more than facilities for emergency use by both Service and civil aircraft and for this purpose one, or at the most, two landing grounds should suffice, preferably near the sea for easy communication. It would perhaps be best, however, that we should avoid specifying particular sites in dealing with the company, or even the number of sites we might require. 3. As we have to look some 75 years ahead we should also perhaps consider the possibility of a change of policy under the terms of which His Majesty 1 s Government might go further than at present in the matter of guaranteeing Sheikhs on the Arabian/ lithwaite, Esq., l^ia Office, S.W.I.2o ^ ral3 ian coast against external aggression, and if anything of that sort came about we might then require more elaborate facilities in QATAR, i.e. stocks of fuel and perhaps bombs together with some accommodation. Such a change of policy should not in fact greatly increase our commitments in the Gulf, if all &gt; as ' tile IIiere knowledge that we were prepared to support Sheikhs under our protection would probably prove to be a sufficient deterrent. In any case this contingency should not necessitate the provision of landing grounds, additional to those mentioned in paragraph 2 above, but only accommodation, fuel stocks and bombs. 4, As far as the A.P.O.C. draft lease is concerned, I do not think we are much concerned except for this question of safeguarding our present, or future, air requirements and it should not matter a great deal whether a clause is inserted in the lease to cover the point or whether it is done by means of an exchange of letters. It is for the political and legal authorities to decide how best our requirements can be safeguarded. Incidentally if the A.P.O.C. obtain a concession they will probably establish a landing ground of their own, and would no doubt be glad to obtain revenue by allowing Imperial Airways to use it. 5. There is one other point which I think I should mention at this stage, in connection with wireless telegra-ptgc It is important' that in the event of a w/l? station or stations being erected on QATAR that the wavelength should be chosen to avoid interference with R.A.F. or Imperial Airways communications, and the Air Ministry should, therefore, be consulted in regard to any proposals of this description.

This desert is, according to Lorioier (II, 892), regarded by some Arabs as a projection of the Hub-ai-Kbaii, but the important point is that it possesses only 'a few wells of very bitter water and a little scanty grazing.

Copy sent to r.ff N-f* vn |2. w86/3-x. 13th January, 1934. mm- Sir, In coBnection with the questions of granting an oil concession in Qatr to the Anglo-Persian Oil Gompany acting on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and in Koweit to a company to be equally controlled by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and by the Gulf Oompany of the U.S.A., I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to state that he has had under consideration one of the conditions to be laid down as a political safeguard in the case of either concession, namely, that the. local personnel operating the concession should be either exclusively, or so far as possible, British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh concerned. 2. Sir Saiuuel Hoare attaches the highest degree of importance to this condition for well known reasons, which need not be fully recapitulated. In vie?/ of the primitive conditions obtaining in the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf, the backward state of the administration, and the uncivilised character of the local and neighbouring populations, it is impossible to ignore the risk of unfortunate incidents or disturbances which might result from the introduction of any considerable number of .American or other foreign personnel of the artisan type into Qatr or Koweit. The danger of incidents would be much greater in the/ fe-Secretary of State, Ppign Office. S.W.I.tho case of foreign than in the case of British personnel, as the former would be less amenable to the advice and instructions of the local British authorities, and at the same time any such incident in which a foreign national suffered might give rise to international complications, as the foreign Power concerned would naturally demand that His Majosty ? s Grovernment should either take steps to enforce reparation, or permit it to intervene itself on behalf of its nationals. 3 # The Secretary of State therefore considers that every endeavour should be made to secure the agreement of any company seeking an oil concession in any of the Arab sheikhdoms to a condition, providing the fullest possible safeguard that the circumstances of a particular case may permit, in regard to the nationality of its local personnel.. He does not suggest that it is necessary to impose a condition in identical terms in all cases, since circumstances may differ, and in some of the sheikhdoms the safeguard desired is of even more importance than in others. 4. It wilj be remembered that the American-controlled Bahrein Petroleum Company agreed to a condition that as many of its employees in Bahrein as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein. Kiis clause does not altogether exclude the employment of ^erioan personnel, and in effect it is largely left to the Company to decide whether the employment of individual ^ericans is necessary for ,? the efficient carrying on 01 the undertaking^, since this is largely a technical point 011 which it would be difficult to dispute the Company s O pinion. ,5 # The Secretary of Stato agrees with the suggestion, which has been made in inter-departmental discussions, that the various political safeguards desired in connection with the grant of oil concessions by the Sheikhs of Qatr and Koweit should be embodied in agreements to be concluded between His Majesty ? s Government and the companies concerned. He also agrees that it is desirable not to insist on such conditions as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the new inglo-iimerican Company in Qatr and Koweit respectively, would clearly ba unable to accept. Bat the importance of the safeguard in regard to the nationality of local personnel is so great that he suggests, firstly, that we should aim at securing its embodiment in the Cfctr and Koweit agreements to the fullest extent that may be possible, and secondly, that our minimum requirement should be a clause following that agreed t,o by the Bahrein Petroleum Company slightly modified so as to provide that as many of the local employees of the Company as is consistent, in the judgment of the Company with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh. This, it is suggested, should the absolute minimum but every effort would be made to induce the Companies to agree to the omission of the words in the judgment of the Company' as otherwise it might not P 0 ssiblc to question in any way the action of the Cumpany in regard to the number of its foreign employees. 6* Sir SMuel Hoare would be grateful for a very early re Ply to this letter. As the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs is aware, the matter is urgent since agreements between the Companies and the Sheikhs concerned cannot be into force - and ought, perhaps,, not to be finally/finally concluded - pending the conclusion of parallel agreements between the Companies and His Majesty's jorernment. 7.

SiiOSi: With reference to your telegram of 25th January, I' Uo,82 and connected correspondence, I write to send you y informally an advance copy of a note which has heen prepared 3on the question of the boundary of Qatar and the problems t wllich ar ise out of it. (We still of course await the |, jv Government of India's recommendations on the actual i boundary question). Copies are being sent to the Foieign Office, and are being submitted here, for consideration; but at the moment it is purely provisional and has no approval of higher authority behind it. Since it was written, we have heard from the Anglo Persian Oil Company that according to one member (Haji A.F .Williamson) of the Geological party t which visited Qatar in Pehruary and March 193-:-, the Soutnern boundary line shown on their map was indicated hy the Shaikh and it looks therefore as though we can with reasonable confidence assume that this is his own view at the present time of his southern 'boundary. This should go a long vve.y to clear the air, though it will leave us with the difficult problems of the attitude to he adopted in respect of the area between the Sheikh's line and the blue line of the 191c Convention. In this connection we should be grateful icr any information you can give us by air mail as to (a)_ The position to-day in the Barr A1 Q ,arah . /pmlby's 'Empty Quarter' suggests that such authority or jurisdiction as may be exercised in it is of an informal character and exercised by Ibn Jiluwi and the Saudi Government. Could you R'ble Lt.Col.T.C .Powle , C.3.E., 116 Residency, Bushire. ■ MCould you also let us know to what extent if at all the coastal strip included in the Barr A1 Qarah is fertile or carries population? (b) The position of Abu Dhabi in the hinterland of Qatar. The note attached places on record that we have recognised Abu Dhabi ownership of the district of Aqal and of the Khor A1 Odeid. Would it be safe to assume that there is no present day claim and/or no present day exercise of authority by Abu Dhabi to the west of Aqal as defined in Lorimer?

The Southern Boundary of Qatar and the Connected Problems. ' The question for settlement is that of the boundaries of the Sheikhdom of Qatar , ^ j s n0 |; bounded by the sea. In the pre-war period the boundary to the south ^as to some extent indeterminate, but broadly speaking was regarded at the time of E compilation of Lorimer's Gazetteer in 1905-07 as running across the base of the batar Peninsula more or less south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point north of BLl-Odeid. There is reason to believe that the Sheikh of Qatar still regards it fc following approximately this line (see paragraph 8 below), but conditions have not ken propitious for raising the question specifically with him, and the present noie iimsat reaching a provisional conclusion on the material available as to— I (a) the southern boundary of Qatar ; [ {&amp;) if the boundaries of Qatar on the south and west do not extend to the blue I line agreed as the eastern frontier of Nejd in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913, the position of the intervening area. I The history of the question is as follows :— The Boundary on the South-East. 2. To the east, the boundary between Qatar and the adjoining Trucial Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi has been the subject of frequent dispute in the past. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has claimed sovereignty over a stretch of Qatar territory running so far Lor. 11, 405. north as the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, south of Wakra on the map attached.^ The Sheikh 4 Qatar, for his part, has claimed sovereignty over areas in the Abu Dhabi peikhdom running as far east as the Sabakhat Matti. His Majesty's Government Lor. II, 88- lave consistently refused to recognise claims so exaggerated by either party, but they lave repeatedly intimated that they regard the Khor-al-Odeid, which lies^ about mid way between the extreme points referred to, as appertaining to Abu Dhabi. They have Lor. H, 89. also recognised the Abu Dhabi claim to the district of Aqal, geographical details of which are given in I (iii) of the Appendix to this note, and which contains both the Khor-al-Odeid and the Khor-adh-Dhuwaihin. We have thus a fixed point for the south-eastern boundary of 'Qatar. The Boundary on the South-West. 1he jjuumuaki ujn ouu in-vy 3.

The southern boundary of Qatar was closely investigated locally between 1904 and 1907 by experienced political officers in connection with the compilation oi iMr.Lorimer's 'Persian Gulf Gazetteer.' The result of their investigation is given ^ the extract from the Gazetteer reproduced as item 1 (i) in the Appendix to tnis pte. Broadly speaking, it went to show that the southern boundary ot the btate ran south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to the north of the Khor-al-Odeid. per the first section, running from Dohat-as-Salwa to the Wells of Sakak, there was *o dispute. The boundary between the Wells of Sakak and the sea on the eastern we of the Qatar Peninsula was, however, indeterminate. Two alternatives (the Merence at its widest point being some 20 miles) were reported by Lonmer. lor ^ rea sons given by him (and substantially based on the historical considerations i ^erred to in paragraph 2 above) he regarded the second alternative as preferable. v e f ec t Of its acceptance would be that the eastern sector of the southern Qatar ■ ^dary would run south-east from the Wells of Sakak to the sea north ot tlie ■M-Odeid.

Persian Gulf area culminated in the latter year in the signature of two GonventL Jjiicli 111 definiug inter alia the eastern limits of Turkish authority in Arabia. The Co a vent 1 ; # c of 29th July 1913, which defined the eastern boundary of Nejd, is alone relevantfi ii# 1 the present purpose. Under that Convention, which, though reference is made tc ^3,110 in the ratified AngL&gt;Turkish Convention of 9th March 1914, was never itself ratifi'^Jbon the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjaq of Nejd was defined by a bine line jtep 1 ' the map running due south from the head of the bay opposite Zaqnuniyeh Island -■ the Persian Gulf to th^ 20th parallel of latitude in the Central Ara'bian Desert. 1 sJ text of the relevant article is given in section II of the Appendix attached kythis N( Its wording ( u una ligne . . . separera le Nedjd de la presqu'ile d'El Katr. 1 , limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue . . . ') would justify a p C01I contention that the blue line was at once the eastern frontier of Nejd and the west ,! 1 |() frontier of Qatar. But there are definite objections to adopting this view. In i ?' .i first place, there is nothing to show that this was, in fact, the intention of Sai( P.Z. 299/34 Majesty's Government at the time when the Convention was concluded, or that tl . had any object beyond limiting the eastern boundary of the Turkish possessions^' this area. Secondly, there is no evidence of any claim to suzerainty by Qatar so r J * to the west or so far to the south. Thirdly, the Resident's telegram of 11th Janu®^ ' 1934,^T. 19, emphasises the absence of control by the Sheikh of Qatar over the intei^ , ;! 1 of his State (and a fortiori over regions so remote from Dohah as are now ut|^® consideration). Fourthly (though this by itself is probably not of serious importaE^ ' ,, 111 the position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud is to some extent compromised, as explained bel'* 800 at any rate as regards the Barr-al-Qarah, by the line fixed by Sir Percy Cox in Fifthly, it iS arguable that even in a formal document such as the 1913 Conventi • the fact that the blue line is spoken of separating Nejd from the Qatar Peningk need not be regarded as determining the boundary of Qatar. The Qatar Penin^wte 11 was the closest prominent geographical feature and the nearest adjoining Arab polit: 1 tielii entity on the mainland, and a reference to it for descriptive purposes was not unnatuiraycb Finally, there is much to be said for giving no avoidable extensions to the boundai of Qatar, even if the consequence is that we have to deal with an area of indetenmi ^ ownership between those boundaries and the blue line. Line indicated in 1922 by Sir P. Cox to Ibn Saud and Major Holmes as the East Limit of any Oil Concession in respect of Hasa. 6. One more incident of importance should be recorded before coming to latest evidence as to the view held by the Sheikh of Qatar aa to his south boundary. The incident is that reported in Colonel Dickson's letter of 4th J 1933, No. 143, to the Political Resident, copies of which were received undef Political Resident's express letter of 18th December 1933, No. 1934 S.; wl Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner for Iraq, in a discussion at Oqair in 1! with Ibn Saud, then Sultan of Nejd, and Major Holmes, warned both the Sdi and Major Holmes that the Sultan could grant no concession, and Major lioli, receive none from him, in respect of the Principality of Qatar, and drew on a n a line running from Djau^ed-Dukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, he indicated, ■ represent the eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in resp of Hasa. Such a line, as will be ^een from the map, excludes the whole Peninsula (and incidentally a substantial area lying to the west of the blue of the Anglo-Turkish Convention). It also includes in Hasa an area to the east 0 blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention. It should, however, be noted that wl 4 it constituted a definite indication of the High Commissioner's view as to the eas boundary of Hasa, it in no way specifically defined the boundaries of Qatar save 1 far as Qatar might be regarded as marching with Hasa and Nejd^ or i . ml ^ A 811 bmdai Dokt-a fc-al claiaisl leftrrei J mlelie satisfac line of feritoi regarded as having been granted a western frontier bounded by the blue me 0 1913 Convention at the time when that Convention was concluded.

It is suggested, in the light of the evidence collected above — I (o) that the south-eastern boundary of Qatar must lie to the north of the Khor-al-Odeid and the district of Aqal; (I) that while His Majesty's Government had at no stage formally recogmsed any specific southern boundary to Qatar (save to the extent re erre o m (a)), such evidence as is available goes to show that the pre-war boundary ran roughly south east across the base of the Peninsula from Dohat-as-Salwa, or a point slightly north of it, to a point north of the Khor-al-Odeid. There is no recorded evidence of any niore extensive claims by the Sheikh of Qatar other than those to Abu Dhabi terutory referred to in paragraph 2 above ; &lt;c) in the light of the above, that, if it proves that the Sheikh of Qatar now regards the line shown on the I.P.O. map as his southern bout iars this may be accepted by His Majesty's Government « geaewfly satisfactory. Acceptance of that line, if we continue to regard the blue line of the 1913 Convention as the eastern boundary of territories (or even if we were to agree to the attribution o ® ' . q Qarah district lying east of the blue line to tasa (see below)), will admittedly leave an area of ^ndetommedowner^jp between 'Qatar and Nejd. The problems involved in this are discussed m greater detail in paragraphs 10 and following If, however. His Majesty s Government are prepared to face them, the boundary m merits that it is consistent with the obligations we have u . ., Abu Dhabi; it is equally consistent with the mamtenanc^ line of the 1913 Convention as against '^n Saud (or ni su &lt; cation of that line as is referred to in |^g«ph^9&lt;e) an^ has the advantage of definitely limiting the area ot any . respect of protection, &amp;c., into which His Majesty's -Goyernmept^ay think it desirable to enter in the event of an oil concession bein 0 ^ y Sheikh.r Position of Area lying between Base of Qatar Peninsula and Blue Line of Anglo-Tukkish Convention of 1913. i ^ 10. If, in these circumstances, it is accepted that the southern boundary of Qal'^Ibt' should be a line running via or to the north of Sakak more or less south-east fri^rfnrtl Bohat-as-Salwa or a point slightly to the north of Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to r sit north of the Khor-al-Odeid, the difficult question arises of the position of the count' v lying between such a line and the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 191 . • .Up Importance of ^Maintaining the Blue Line. bj# 11. On the one hand, it appears definitely important if possible to maintain blue line laid down in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as agaip^ 1 Ibn Saud or any other future ruler of this part of Arabia. While the 1913 Conventi was never ratified, the blue line at any rate represents the agreement reached at t time between Turkey and His Majesty's Government as to the limits of Tnrki ^ authority in northern Arabia and on the Persian Gulf, and in dealing with Ibn Sai|foiereai as the successor in title to the Turks we can, it would seem, not unreasonably ti as is our stand on it. The difficulties of finding any satisfactory substitute are palLtea^ The undesirability of giving Ibn Saud, in the absence of any definite eastern bounda '^kr to his territories, an excuse for territorial expansion (as distinct from the exercise, ggt (lei at present, of an informal influence and the receipt from our Arab clients of paymeii which we do not recognise and the existence of which we ignore) in the hinterland^ l the Trucial Coast and of Muscat is equally clear. Such expansion would clea], coN( y involve a risk either of his coming into conflict with the local rulers, whose tre^isi relations with His Majesty's Government he has formally lecognised, or of -1' w establishing an influence in the Sheikhdoms in question so powerful as to ; l embarrassing from our point of view. fris-^eWant,-finally, that confidential ! ■ mation suggests that ibn Saud does nothimself at the moment seriously question blue line. ij if O *j 161 'Vj i if . . Disadvantages of Maintenance of the Blue Line while fixing Southern Boundari 1 5 ? n m of Qatar at the Base of the Qatar Peninsula. • psoieijoj ■Uiptl 12. At the same time, important on general grounds, for the reasons given,j| ra j| 01 the maintenance of the blue line appears to be, the fact must be faced that in jijonp present case, if we continue to regard it as the eastern boundary of Ibn Saud's territo;., j|y and if, as suggested, we accept a southern boundary lor Qatar running roughly acra'y^ the base of the Qatar Peninsula, a not inconsiderable area lying between the States, and peopled by migratory Bedouin tribes, will be left in an indetermin^,^^ political position. There is a possibility that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who has the past exercised a wide influence, and made tribal alliances of his own, in |litlie(|ii( trucial hinterland—c/. Sir P. Cox's letter No. 176 of 28th June 1904—might prpsohhi some claim to such an area. But, though on this point further information will |ti){ [()D1 sought from the Resident, there seems little evidence of any active interest on iiflie jsta part of Aha Dhahi in any area to the west of Aqal. Assuming that no such clfs: 'To -iaj exists, or could be substantiated, the alternatives are to recognise the area ^ 0 f belonging to Ibn Saud; to recognise it as belonging to the Sheikh of Qatar; or regard it as a political no-man's land. ifefe 'i 13. If we recognised it as belonging to Ihn Saud we could, if necessary, call him to;keep Bedouin raids into Qatar from it under control. But such recogniti-::;^ would not merely be inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the l ( J%p r0 p e] Convention, to the abandonment of which, as stated above, the objections appear tolt^y Strong, but would represent a formal acceptance of Saudi sovereignty to the bordpl^ or Qatar and Abu Dhabi which might well prove embarrassing. Wbq j 14. If, on the other hand, it is attributed to the Sheikh of Qatar, we should % 8S justified in expecting the full co-operation of the Sheikh in dealing with Bedo^toienof activities within its limits. But such an attribution would not merely to give to Qat^tHt^ a eubstantial area which she does not in the past appear to have claimed, but wo#^ extend the limits of any liability for protection which we may undertake in connecti^tli eex j s with the grant of an oil concession. It might be necessary to claim the area (or :; ':orH 0 | any rate its coastal strip) for Qatar if there were serious signs of foreign inten* ^ in it or of an intention on the part of Ibn Saud to occupy it. But pending su ^j^^ developments it seems wiser to limit our commitments and to avoid any extension 4 ^ the area recognised by us as Qatar.Hi S8 805| feajL of 111 ^lljj i limits i alingiil ^ IM fetin iteeafe rom| iclieiiii io tlicl insioii nileis,) ^oisei poweil at-fflfe iewir!

Nature and Political Conditions of the Indeterminate Area. ifi Before reaching a conclusion it may be well to place on record such scanty [formation as is available about the nature and the political conditions of the Ir, ILtft area Apart from the coastal district known as the Barr-al-Qarah, n further discussed in paragraph 18 below, the bulk of it appears to belong K TArah desert, which Lorimer describes as an area 'possessing only a few Lis of very bitter water, a little scanty grazing, with a surface of red and burning 3 • • md' in which living conditions are extremely difficult and which is frequented | any considerable extent 'only by 'the hardy A1 Morrah, and even they avoid Lmg it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from^ more powerful enemies I Appendix, section I (vi)). Since the date of Lorimer s Gazetteer, Mr Bertram Imas, on Ms recent crossing of the Rub-al-Khab, has passedhrough t^sara trom south to north, travelling from the well of Banaiyan near Latitude ^8 11 40 via Haluwain, Nakhala, and the western extremity of a salt lake lying immedidtely west oithe Khor-al-Odeid, across the pre-war Qatar frontier to Dohah. His account is of importance because it makes it clear that such local control as 's exercised is percised solely by nomad Bedouin tribes (and principally the A who tribe dwelling in the sands, whose influence extends well down into the Rub-al-Kha &gt; fondly, even though he travelled with a ' rabia,' or guarantor, from the Al Murra Arab..

A26 The Barr-al-Qaraii District. v | ■ 18. The importance of this district for the present purpose is first that it emWJ the coastal strip lying between the blue line and the pre-war western extremity of 1c Qatar, and secondly that it appears to correspond fairly closely, if not exactly with ll the triangle of land lying to the east of the blue line, which falls within the am W, ' • 0 k . oJT 0 rough line indicted to Ibn SaV and Major Holmes by Sir P Ool m 1922 (see paragraph 6 above) Mr. Philby, with the assistance of recommendation^ and guides furnished by Ibn Jiluwi, the Saudi Governor of Hasa, travelled throuo-h a portion of it m 1932.

On this assumption the boundaries of Nejd m the 1913 Convention might well have been fixed so as to include it, with the result that the limits of Nejd woald have touched the pre -war limits of Qatar on the coastline at the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, the hinterland ^ (actually the^ Jafurah Desert) being left in indeterminate ownership. For whatever reason (and .it must be assumed that substantial justification was produced to persuade ^ the lurks to relinquish their position in the Barr-al-Qarah) the line was in fact fixed F t0 • WeSt ' Bat tlie hist0 F'T of tile Barr-al-Qarah, and the fact that the ^ 191,3 Couven.^on had never been ratified, may well have been the reasons which led :n ' 1 ' feir P. Cox in 1922 to fix the limits of Hasa at a point which included in it the Barr-al-Qarah rather than at the blue line of the 1913 Convention. Conclusions. 19. In the light of the examination of the position given above, and subject to the observations of the Government of India and the Political Resident, the best course would appear to be the following :— (a) Boundaries of Qatar. To agree that the boundaries of Qatar shall he-accepted as being on the north, east and west, the sea ; on the south, a line running across the base of the Peninsula from a point not south of the latitude of the , a , head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay to a point not south of the north side of thlf Ivhor-al-Odeid inlet. Ihe line indicated on the I.P .O. map would satisfy/ 1 ' MI these criteria, and if it is confirmed that it is the line at present claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar it could be accepted.

As it appears to be largely inhospitable desert under Ikhwan control, save for the coastal strip of the Barr al-Qarah, the likelihood that oil companies will actively interest themselves in it is probably small. If they do, on the principle that Ibn 'Saucl has no interest east of the blue line, it might be necessary to consider whether to attribute it to Qatar or Abu Dhabi (the wording of the 1913 Convention, as quoted in paragraph 5 above, would assist us in claiming it for Qatar). It would in any event be desirable, in order to prevent foreign interests from endeavouring to establish a foothold in it, to consider in what way it could best be made clear that we regarded it as falling within our own sphere of influence orjha^Lpne of our Trucial allies. |e) When once oil operations l^lve started in Qatar,^t o^co nvey a warning through onoftr LUg the Sheikh of Qatar, if^rtsm circumstances appoS? to make thigynoooocaty to the migratory Bedouin tribes who use the area referred to in {d) that in the event of their crossing, with hostile intent or save for normal peaceful pursuits, such as grazing, such line as may be fixed as the boundary of Qatar, they will do so at their own peril. The local political authorities would no doubt be able to ascertain and to advise what customary rights in respect of grazing, &amp;c. these migratory tribes at present enjoy within Qatar proper. On the question whether any corresponding intimation should be made to Ibn Saud in respect of tribes permanently belonging to Nejd but using- the indeterminate area it seems definitely preferable, in the interest of i avoiding discussion with him of the position of the indeterminate area and of the blue line, to make no communication unless and until'circumstances )make this qui te inevitable. The question of any communication in respect of iNejdi tribes ! using Qatar territory could equally be postponed ^unless and until circumstances w^ve thought W make it necessary India Office, 26th January 1934, J. G. L aithwaite. APPENDIX. Boundaries of Qatar. I —E xtracts from L orimer's G azetteer. m w 3#' (i) Qatar, (O.—Mr. Lorimer's article on Qatar is stated to be the result of special enquiries made over a number of years locally.) | Lorimer, Vol. II, page 1506, defines the boundaries of Qatar as follows :— On the east, north and west, Qatar is surrounded by the sea. The southern boundary is somewhat, indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dohat-as-Salwa on the western side of the promontory, and from that point runs south-eastw ards to the wells of Sakak. Thence, according to one account, it strikes east-north- east to the north end of the Naqiyan sandhills, or, according to another, east by south to the southern end of the same hills on the north side of the entrance to Khor-al-Odaid. As the territory of the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has never clearly been asserted to extend beyond Khor-al-Odaid, and as the Al-lhani leikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the Naqiyan tract, the latter of the two alternative lines is to be preferred ; the British Government have recognised Khor-al-Odaid as belonging to Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot b e placed nearer to Trucial. Oman, though the Al-Thani Sheikhs assert a right 0 the whole coast as far as the Sabakhat Matti. It is said that three men stationed at Dohat-as-Salwa, Sakak and Niqa-al-Maharah, respectively, can watcn e ^hole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea.'lie* (ii) Khor-al-Odaid. In Vol. Hi on 'page 1367, Mr. Lorimer describes Khor-al-VJaid as 'an inlet creek on the coast of the Abu Dhabi principality as its extreme western end. It lies about 180 miles almost due west from the town of Abu Dhabi. The boundary of Qatar is either at, or a short distance to, the north of the inlet.' (Ql (iii) Aqal. In Vol. 71, pages 88-89, Mr. Lorimer describes Aqal as u a small littoral district at' the base of the Qatar peninsula upon the east side ; it is bounded by Khor-al-Odaid on the north-west and by Dohat-an-Nakholah on the south-east, the dislance hetweeiiiil^ r(!l .which in a direct line is nearly 35 miles. Inland the depth of the district is on an average about 20 miles.' [N.B.—Nathal (Sandah) in Aqal is .20 to 25 miles inland,&lt;it^ westward, from the foot of Khor-al-Odaid.] ' On the landward side Aqal is enclosed;.;-:^' by Mijan on the east, the Jafurah desert on the south and south-west, and by Qatar on the north-w r est. . . .

The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended the Bay of Umm -al-Hul, near Wakrah in Qatar, but his claim was not approved by the Government of India; Bishairiyah has also been named as the limit of his State in this direction, biit no gOod reason has been adduced for supposing that bisi gL jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al-Odaid, though the northern shore of that^', inlet should perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories.^^ Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined. It is asserted that on the east they reach to the Bareimi oasis, but without taking it in, and on the south they may presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba-al-Khali.' I ^ (v) Barr-al-Qarah.

T,19 of Hth January) of the provisions of Article 6 of his Treaty of 1916, and warn him (in,the terms suggested at the end of paragraph 1 of the enclosed memorandum) that he will not 'be permitted to grant a concession to any company which is not at least partly British. The Secretary of State, who is fully alive to the necessity for careful handling of this question with,a view to avoiding diplomatic difficulties with the United States of America, agrees with the Resident that an intimation of this nature could not he represented as a shutting of the 'open door' in Qatar, since, as Colonel Fowle points out, the Iraq Petroleum Company, to which any concession obtained hy the Anglo Persian Oil Company would he immediately transferred, contains an American element. (c) that the Resident should further, in such manner as he thinks 'best, but in such a way as to leave no douht in the Sheikh's mind, inform the Sheikh in so many words that His Majesty's Government wish to see the concession granted to-the Anglo Persian Oil Company - Iraq Petroleum Company combine. It seems pro hah le that a definite intimation of the wishes of His Majesty's Government is more likely to secure their acceptance by the Sheikh tnan if there is room for any uncertainty as to what nis Majesty 1 Government desire, or the view they would take of any failure to comply with their advice, and prima facie there would seem to be advantage in a definite intimation uo uhe Sheikh of this nature. The Resident could at the same time make such play as is possible with the generosity of the terms ?» T hich have been offered by the Anglo Peisian Gil Company and might be authorised to hint, but in vague and general/(3^ r! 1 3. general terms, at the extremely difficult situation which' is likely to arise for the Sheikh in the event of his failing to take our advice on this question. Sir Samuel ^ Ho are, would however deprecate any suggestion to the Sheikh ' that Ton Saud is behind the Standard Oil Company or would desire to see the Qatar concession granted to them, or the use of the argument that the grant of a concession to the Standard Oil of Galifornia would lead to the absorption of the Sheikh 1 s territory by Ibn Saud and the disappearance of the Sheikh as an independent ruler. (d) that the Resident should be authorised to promise the Sheikh, in the event of his granting the concession to the Anglo Persian Oil Company (Iraq Petroleum Company) the grant of the full protection against aggression by land for which he asked in 193 S. Sir Samuel Ho are would leave the method of approaching the Sheikh on this point to the Resident. It may well be that, as Colonel Fowle suggests in paragraph 4 of his telegram of 26th January, the better tactics would be to lead the Sheikh himself to raise uhe question of protection and then, in order to ennance the value of the undertaking proposed to be given, Tf to assume suitable hesitation and reply that the matter must oe referred to His Majesty's Government'. (e) Sir Samuel Hoare entirely agrees with the Government of India's view as expressed in their telegram y^flo.lE? of 20th January, that a surrender of jurisdiction over foreign subjects should be made an indispensable pre -condition of our consent to the grant of any concessiions by the Sheikh under Article 5 of his Treaty- But, in txie light of their views and those of Colonel i-uwlc, ne oe prepared if necessary to await a xatei ^ — - - ..—- negotiati ons j4. negotiations with the Sheikh 'before raising this question with him. The first essential is to secure the Sheikh's agreement in principle to the grant of the Qatar oil concession to the Anglo Persian Oil Company (Iraq Petroleum Company) . Once that consent has 'been secured, and before the final approval of His Majesty's, Government is given to the grant of a concession, the question of jurisdiction can 'be raised. Such play as is possible can then 'be made with the adverse financial effect on the Sheikh if His Majesty's Government were forced to refuse approval to the grant of a concession merely 'because he adopted a recalcitrant attitude regarding it; and it can 'be impressed upon him that 8. surrender of jurisdiction will be an essential prerequisite of the grant of any concession to any applicant whoever he may be. The same opportunity can be taken, if necessary, for considering oringing into force the dormant articles of the Sheikh's treaty, of wnich, as the Government of India remark, txie only one of real importance is the appointment of a political Agenb. again, however, the Secretary ox State would suggest that a full discretion should be left to Colonel Eowxe. I-? any reason circumstances appear propitious, either in the discussions which it is now proposed that he should immediately undertake with the Sheikh or su'bsequent0.3?, to raise any or all of these questions, he might he allowed uu do so. in such manner as he thinks lit. 4.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) J. G. WALTON.mcRANnnivi . It seems clear In the first place that the political difficulties which might arise from the grant of a concession in respect of Qatar to any company which is not at least partly British, ana from which the requisite safeguards for British political interests cannot te obtained, are likely to tie extremely serious. It is now accepted that the maintenance of the special British position on the Arah littoral of the Gulf is of cardinal importance, a fact which has heen further stressed in recent months toy the rapid developments of air communication - likely to develop still more rapidly in the future - and hy the possibility that H.M.G. may te unable to retain their naval station at Henjam. The Sheikhdom of Qatar is of particular importance because of its geographical position on the southern littoral of the Persian Gulf. The establishment of a non-British oil company in Qatar, particularly if identical or closely associated with the American company to which Ibn Saud has granted the Kasa concession, must inevitably sooner or later react unfavourably on the position of H.M.G. in the vitally Important sheikhdom of Bahrein. It will equally inevitably prejudice in an Increasing degree as time goes on the position of H.M.G. in the semi-barbarous areas of the Trucial Coast- H.M.G.-have in the past, as a deliberate policy, abstained from interference or the exercise of influence in the internal affairs and in the hinterland of those areas. With the rapid development of air communication, and the possibility of pressure by oil interests to obtain concessions, that policy may before v ery long require reconsideration: and it is essential that la dealing with i^itar nothing should be done which might/mammmrn. — —i &gt;11 2. might place H.M.G. in a weaker position to secure their desiderata in that event. It is unnecessary to develop f the.local political difficulties likely to arise in the case of Qatar itself should any concession be locally exploited save by British personnel, or be under non- British c ontrol • In these circumstances the course suggested in paragraph 5 of the Political Resident's ji' telegram T.19 seems the right one to adopt. The wording to be used by Colonel Powle in his discussion with the Sheikh might be that having regard to their special treaty relations with the sheikh, would not be prepared to agree to the grant of a concession by him of any kind in respect of Qatar to a company which was not at least partly British'. 2. Ibn Saud and the Qatar concession . This raises an important question of policy • The Resident and the Government of India have drawn attention to the possibility that Ibn Saud may endeavour to support the efforts of the Standard Oil Company to secure the Qatar concession with a view to himself 'absorbing' Qatar; and to the risks involved in any attercpt by Ida Saud to grant 'protection' in the hinterland to any oil concessionnaire in (^.tar. Reference is invited to rt)? Colonel Powle's telegram No.98 of 29th January as regards the reports of Ton Saud's attitude on these points. Biey appear, however, to be largsly derived from local rumours ihe basis for which is to some degree uncertain. Be that as it may, Ibn Saud, by Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda of 1927, has undertaken to respect the special treaty relations of H.M.G. with the Sheikh of Qatar. Any attempt 01 i his part to 'absorb' the Qatar Sheikhdom would be wholly inconsistent with the provisions of the ireaty in question/3. question, and prima, facie it would seem very doubtful whsther Ton 3aud would, unless some quite radical change takes place in the general situation, he disposed to face the very serious consequences of the breach with H.M.G. which a flagrant disregard of his treaty obligations would involve, m these circumstances it does not seem necessary to regard very seriously the probability of a formal attempt at absorption. 5. The possihility of an attempt hy Ihn Saud to grant 'protection' to an oil concessionnaire in the hinterland jpggggggflHMIIIIIMII niilliwm of Qatar is to some extent connected with the difficult question of what eastern limits H.M.G. recognise to Ihn Spud's authority. The question of the boundaries of Qatar is being dealt with in a separate Note. But it appears probable that the sheikh recognises as his western and southern boundary line a line running south- south-east across the base of the Qjatar peninsula from a point about 12 miles north of Dohat-as-3alwa to a point some 10 or 12 miles north of the Khor-al-Odeid. Ton Saud's eastern boundary has not formally been defined in any Treaty engagement with H.M.G. But the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjaq of Nejd as constituted by title Blue Line of the unratified Anglo-Turkish convention of 1913 lies well to the west of the boundary of Qata,r suggested above by the Sheikh. While It is common knowledge that Ibn saud exercises a strong and even preponderant influence of an unofficial character to the east of the Blue Line, possibly so far to the east as the Barelmi Oasis, it is suggested that any effort on his P^rt to exert or extend an off1cial influence or formally grant protection east of that line to oil companies oi others, should be strongly resisted, and that if the question/i-1 c t 4. question arises Kn Saud should be informed that H.M.G. regard the Blue Line as his eastern boundary, even if this involves consideration of a claici on the part of ' H.M.G. that the western boundary of Qatar is so far to the west as the Blue Line. If the adoption of this attitude is approved it should afford a firm basis on which to deal with any effort on the part of Itrn $iud to grant 'protection' in the hinterland of Qatar and East of the Blue Line to any oil concessionnaires. 4. The grant of protection to the Sheikh against aggression bv land . The question will, however, be of less importance if H.M.G. are prepared to accept responsibility for the ciefence of Qptar against landward aggression. (Compare in I this connection Sir Hugh Biscoe's Despatch No.571-3 of 7th June 1932 (P.Z.3520/32), and Captain prior's Report /No.C. 150 dated 20th August 1932 enclosed in Bushire ^Despatch 611-S of 26th August 1932 (P.2.5431/32). It is f*) for the Air Ministry to say whether they would anticipate any difficulty in granting the necessary protection were H.M.G, to approve its grant in principle. It is for them (i-jalso to give such estimate as may be possible of the probable financial burden of granting such protection. Such information as is available about the area lying in the hinterland of Qatar suggests that it is populated by migratory Bedouin tribes who pay an informal and vague allegiance to Ton Saud, but who, for the most part, are for practical purposes independent. Were the sheikhdom of Qatar a rich and fertile area with good grazing grounds there might perhaps be a greater risk of frequent raiding from the desert area. But so far as we are aware, this is not the case and the principal inducement to raiders would be such plunder as could be secured from the raiding of/5. ox settlements established in connection v/ltii oil operations, or such blackmail as could te levied on the oil conce ssionnaire or the Sheikh as the price,of non- f interference. As will he seen, neither the Political Resident nor the Government of India, who have long experience of tills quarter, appear to regard the grant of protection in present circumstances as involving very serious commitments. The Air Council, whose officers have first-hand personal experience of the Qatar Peninsula, may te able to throw further light on this point. Subject, liowever, to any view which may be expressed dy them, there seems a strong case for the acceptance of liability for protection (since whoever obtained an oil concession in - i r i ii —---'-' ■ - Qatar an indirect liability would fall on H.M.G.), and for using to the utmost the very substantial reassurance which this should represent to the sheikh to persuade him to grant an oil concession to the A.P.CuC. The grant of protection would not absolve .the sheikh from taking his own measures so far as possible to defend his principality, but it would cover any unprovoked aggression across his southern boundary. If that southern boundary is, at any rate as a temporary measure,, fixed at the point which the Sheikh himself at present apparently contemplates, such protection will be necessary against the nomad tribes of the desert. IX, for any reason (and it mignt well be | 'i HWWUlli I.i j hecessary to consider this) it proved necessary to claim that Qatar influence or Qatar territory extended so far to the west as the blue line, there would still be a danger of incursions from the desert area to the south; the population of hpmad Bedouin using a Sheikhdom with such boundaries would be substantially increased, and to that extent the undertaking/7,8-1 6. undertaking of a larger commitment would tie Involved. On •the ottier hand it would te possible, if the boundaries of rto+Bt- and iveid marched, equally to require the Saudi Government, so long at any rate as that Government remains in effective control of Hasa and Nejd, to control any pilds ty trides permanently settled in their territory dcross the houndary of Saudi Araoia.P.z. 688/34, 1st February, 1934.

S.32797, on the subject of air facilities in Qatar. 2. Walton will write separately to you about the point raised in the first sub-paragraph of paragraph 3. He asks me to say that he has noted the verbal alteration suggested in your paragraph 6. 3. As I have explained to you informally, we are taking up in the light of the telegrams of which you have had copies the question of giving the bheiicn Oi- w,aoar ^ guaiv .i .noee of protection against landward aggression in return for the grant by him of an oil concession to the AngLo -persian Oil Company, and an official letter consulting you with particular referoncv to the Question of protection and the commitments which dais AAhJUio would involve will I hope reach you 4k)i:io|^ ow . 4. We are particularly anxious, subject, ofcourse, uo the concurrence of the interested departments, ^o put Resident in a position to say something defini te to 'cLe 3aei ' about the grant of protection, should ci^cuiustances in opinion make this desirable, and while we entirely agree uhat the two points dealt with in paragraph 4 of your reply will have to 'be considered before any final coraiait^nt is entered into, we trust that the Air Minisux% in their to our official letter will be prepared to agree oon-id of them need not delay progress with regard to general policy an d/ pomander W.A.McClaughry.DSO. ,MC. ,DFC., Ministry, Adastral House, Sings way, vv » G • 2 •v 8 1 Ldthat the Resident should be given discretion, if he thinks fit to give a general undertaking (subject to consideration of at any rate the point raised in the first sub-paragraph of [paragraph 4) immediately, 5. Our general view would be that the question of any reconnaissance over Qatar should be left until the question of protection has been broached,. Particularly if it is broached L the Sheildi, the Resident will be in a position to take the line that, while the matter must be referred to His Majesty 1 s Government, they will obviously oe anxious in the first place to ascertain what difficulties are involved in the grant of ^■*-0 oCs^uAJ' protection, and for this purpose it would^oe possible for him to obtain the consent of the Sheikh to reconnaissance flights :of the nature which you suggest. As the result of these reconnaissance flights, which need not, I imagine, take very long, fit would presumably be possible for the Air Ministry to reach final conclusions without delay as to the landing grounds whicn | they would require in the event of a guarantee of protection ! being given. The connected question of intelligence is one for settlement between the departments concerned in consultation with the Political Resident, and is not of immediate urgency. 6. On the points to which you refer in paragraph 5 of your letter, I may say that in the event of our entering into i closer relations with the Sheikh of /Qatar consequent on the pant of an oil concession by him, we should, as at present I advised, proposed to aim at securing that- the air jprooedoie which has 'been agreed with the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office [ ia the case of Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat should equally apply to l^tar - i n other words that' there shoul^ be a formal agreement 'ith the Sheilch covering civil aviation (and providing for the I .Payment to him of a' certain rent in respect of such civil aviation ■facilities as might he provided), accompanied hy a binding exchange of/nf lettei 6 In regard to the activities of military aircraft. Diis would cover point (a) in paragraph 5 of your letter so f a r as aerodromes were ccneerned, and the conditions under which military aircraft could fly over the principality as a whole could be worked out 'between us aaad the Resident with a view to proposals to the Sheiich on this subject also 'being considered, 7^ Point (b) in the same paragraph is closely connected with the question of protection. If the 'Sheikh is offered and acceiDts our projection we assume that no dilficulty woulci arise about the provision of refuelling facilities. Detailed arrangements in regard to the provision of labour for the malting or improvement of landing grounds could be a matter for local agreement. A guarantee for their safety would be covered by the agreement referred to in the preceding paragraph. The question of what, if any, payment would be necessary, is one on which we should .in due course like the xiesicent' s advice. He would no doubt consult Air Officer Commanding Iraq in connection with it. 8, The question raised in paragraph 5 (c) can be considerea in due course. It is not a matter of immediate importance. 9. As regards paragraph 5 (d) of your letter, the draft Concession contains no provision for the use of independent air facilities by the oil concessionnaire. If we can secure an agreement with the Sheildi on the same lines as we propose in phrein, Koweit and Muscat, it will secure in practice complete control to His Majesty's Government of any air facilities, and if the Company should ever wish to establish a landing ground of their own. a condition such as you suggest could be considered as a term of approval to it. We* think it unnecessary to take U P the point now. 10* I am sending copies of this letter to Warner at the foreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty, and Starling at the27 ' I fE7/l934, * AIR MINISTRY, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C.2. I2797* £9tii January 1934. My dear Laitliwaite, i vfc' 1. With reference to your letter P.g.8215/33 of Elst December 1933, and to Walton's letter to me P»2«40l/34 of 18th January 1934, on the subject of 4atar and to the telegram b which we subsequently sent to Headquarters, Iraq, on 20th January 1934 of which a copy was sent to you, the Air Officer Coimaanding, Iraq, has since expressed views regarding what he considers to be our requirements, and a copy of the telegram in which he did so has also been sent to you, as far as sites for landing grounds are concerned, ■ the following are either mentioned by the Air Officer Commanding in his telegram or have been mentioned in previous reports:- Eoha Site for emergency landing ground exists 7 miles west of Doha and i mile east of Fort Bferan. ..Doha F'aish Shakh * Suitable area observed from the air for a landing ground close to the sea and near a well (probably bracki sh). Zubara. Area suitable for a landing ground observed from the air but it appeared liable to suffer from flooding. Mentioned by the Air Officer Commanding in his telegram but regarding which no information is available• 3. We shall not of course require all those landing grounds but as it has never been possible thoroughly to examine f 4atar with a view to finding landing grounds, our information on the su^ect is rather meagre, and it is suggested therefore that in dealing with the company care should be taken to allow as much scope as possible for future developments, in other words, that our hands should be left as free as possible to increase/ la ithwaite, Esq., India Office, S.W.I.increase or extend our facilities if found necessary at a later date* In tiais connection it is possible that the suggested wording of the safeguarding clause (5) in the Goyernment Agreement, mentioned on page 2 of Walton^s letter, which says 'any sites which may have heen selected' would not give us a sufficiently free hand to extend or increase air facilities, if it should eventually be necessary to do so• We discussed this point recently and you agreed it should be possible to arrange for wording of this clause in a manner which would meet both the Company 1 s and our requirements. Will you please let us know what you would suggest? As far as can be seen at present our requirements will be limited to two landing grounds. {aj Doha if it is found to be good enough, or failing that the next best alternative, as our main landing ground. (b) Karaana, if one can be found there, or alternatively some other advanced landing ground in the vicinity of that place. I am afr4id we cannot define our requirements more precisely than this until it has b©en possible to carry out a thorough reconnaissance on the ground to examine these and possibly other likely sites. Perhaps you would consider the possibility of our being given permission to do this. 4. We understand you are now considering the desirability of offering the Sheiich a guarantee of protection against external aggression in exchange for concessions on his part, and if anything comes of this it will be essential for us to be given an opportunity of examining likely sites on the ground (for landplanes and flying boats) before committing ourselves definitely on the subject. Any change in the existing policy, which added to our coiiimitments in the matter of protection of ^atar against external aggression would also involve careful consideration of the problem of intelligence. As you know, the succesd of air operations depends very largely ^ipon efficient intelligence, and we normally (in Iraq for instance) provide our own Intelligence Officers. Apart/3. Apart from other considerations our concurrence in the acceptance oi additional coiMiitiaents in i4atar or elsewiiere in the Gul-ij would certainly depend to a considerable extent upon arrangements being agreed to for the provision of such additional intelligence facilities as might prove necessary. I merely mention this point at this stage so that you ma:j take note of it, and it need not delay progress with regard to general policy. In his most recent telegram the Air Officer Oommanding raises certain additional points, as follows;- (aj That.sanction is required to fly oyer Qatar at all Ut tile 11884 for obtaining prior permission 'of course, fly over ,atar when we wish to^o ah now but it might be advantageous to ooyer this uoint in any new treaty or agreement with the Sheikh/ It I™ 1 '' ' (b) She Air Officer Commanding asks that he may be allowed estaolish refuelling facilities at Doha.

(o) The Air Officer Commanding asks that fuel, oil, spares and otrvioe material shall be admitted to Qatar duty free GnTo We ^ t ? i that this is a Point which might well be covered in any agreement with the Sheikh. (d) Another point raised is that the company shall be required provide free facilities for Service aircraft at *any landing ground which they may make and it would be advantageous if this could be arranged. 6# [fe agree with the additional qualifying clause whioh you propose adding to the last sentence of Article 5 (A) in the | 0Weit Co ™ercial Draft Agreement, in order to safeguard the f Position under the aircraft agreement which is being proposed to the/the Sheikli of Koweit, but suggest addition of the word 'oivil' before 'aircraft' in the penultimate line of page 2 of Walton 1 s letter to me P.401/34 of 18th January 1934* ^ &gt; 7.

Four years ago he instituted a suit for Rs.104/8/- against one Muhammad bin Jasim, a Bahrain subject, who left Bahrain before a summons could be served on him. Later the Plaintiff received information that the Defendant was living in Qatar, so he applied to my predecessor for a letter of good offices which was given to him in the name of his agent Mubarak bin ^d. The Agent did not recover the debt from the defendant,nor did he return the Sanad, The Plaintiff has, therefore, decided to go himself to Qatar and recover his claim from the Defendant.

After Gomiolimenta, I was informed that an Indian Maharaj arrived at Doha without previous notice or information from me and that he began to go about in the streets and visit some sjispicious quarters. I was surprised to hear about this affair. I sent for the said person and asked him about his sudden arrival and &gt; ; ■' * about landing without permission,and how he happened to go about and come suddenly to this side. He replied that he came in connection with a man named Muhammad bin Jasim a.nd that he had a letter from you and seeing that the man was not present &gt; here he thought that there was no need for him to submit the letter he had with him. I, however, asked him to give me the letter which he did.. i was pleased to receive your letter dated the 5th Ramadhan 1352(23rd December 1933)and was glad to know that you were in good health and to note its contents. As regards Maharaj Matannomal, he has arrived at this side in the manner described above but the defendant was absent. I am very thankful to you for kindly enquiring aboul my health and to say that I am enjoying the best of health.

Final record. of meeting helo. at the India Office on Thursday, 14th .• December, to consider the P.O.C.re- draft of the Q^tar Concession. present : Mr. Laithwaite In the Chair. Mr. C.P.A. Warner Mr. K.5. Johnstone) Foreign Oiixce. Mr. Seal ) Op tain E.L.3. King ) Admiralty. M. V.O., 5.N.) Mr. P.C. Starling petroleum Department. Mr. G.B. CromDie Ihaia Office. Mr. Laithwaite recalled that the meeting had been arranged at short notice to enable Departments to consider what amendments were desirable In the redraft of the Qatar concession, of which copies had been circulated by the A.P.OiC. at the meeting at the India Office on 11th December. It was proposed that it should be followed the same afternoon by a further meeting between Messrs. Fraser and Hearn of the A.P»0.C., at which Mr. Starling and Mr. Laithwaite, in the light of the views expressed by the Departments, could indicate in general terms the directions in which it was desired to amend their draft. It would of course be impossible to conrnit H.M.G. in any way'on the major question of assignment. Neither on this question, nor, indeed, on the details of the draft, had instructions yet been taken from higher authority. But if amendments not raising points of principle, but representing improvements from our point of view, could be secured in the draft in the course of discussion with the Company's representatives, no difficulty would presumably be seen. The/The other Departments concerned expressed their general agreement, in particular as to the importance of avoiding any ccmmitment on the question of assignment or safeguards. The meeting then proceeded to consider the revised draft put forward by the Company. Pre^^e^ n was agreed that no question arose on this. Article 1. Attention was drawn to the fact that the revised article gave exclusive rights 'throughout the State of Qatar.' The area involved was, so far as could 'be estimated, something over 3,000 square miles. It was decided that no objection need be taken to the grant of an exclusive concession to the Company and that it was unnecessary to require that the rights of exploration, prospecting and mining should be specified in separate schedules. The Petroleum Department drew attention to the fact that the article as revised gave the C cmpany the exclusive right to 'carry away' the substances which it was entitled to secure, but saw no objection to this, as the C ompany was the sole concessionnaire and there was no provision for surrendering a part of the territ ory, Mr.Laithwaite said that the Government of India had sent a reminder to the Political Resident on the question of the boundaries of Qatar. If this question was raised by the Company it would be better not to conmit ourselves. We could wait to see what map they produced. The Foreign Office representatives emphasised that they attached importance to this question, since an inaccurate definition of the boundary might lead to trouble with Ibn Saud. Article 2. The following points were raised: (a) the desirability of making provision to safeguard the position of aerodrones» It was agreed that this should be put to the Company, though the decision was con plicated by the fact that we had not yet acquired a permanent site. In reply to a question by Mr.Laithwaite as to the probability of any special7 3. Admiralty interest developing in connection with harbours, Captain King expressed the opinion that it was unnecessary to make special provision for this at the present time. (b) It was not clear whether the words 'any such normal extensions thereof' referred to extensions of the 'agreement or to extensions of religious lands, tnough presuraioly to the letter. It was agreed that the Company should he asked to make the position clear, hut that no ohjection neea he raised if the assumption stated was correct. (,c) The phrase at the end of suh-paragraph 1 'and ahy subsequent extensions thereof' appeared dangerously wide. We were dealing with a period of 75 years and it was conceivable that difficult political problems might,arise if the Sheikh or one of his successors were, e.g., to conquer a portion of Saudi Arabia or,to take an extreme case, to occupy Bahrein. It was agreed that the Company should be invited to omit the words. (d) period of agreement . No objection was seen to an agreement for 75 years, although this period was longer than that of the Bahrein and Persian concessions. (e) The Petroleum Department said that it was unnecessary to specify areas for mining purposes under this article now that it was proposed to give the Company rights over the whole area of the state. (f) Attention was drawn by the India Office to the fact that in a semi-civilized area such as Qatar it would be necessary for the Company to walk extremely warily in anything which might offend religious suscept ibilities. -Neshould find ourselves faced with responsibility for safeguarding their interests in the event of serious trouble breaking out and it would be well/Q) r 4, well to impress upon them the delicacy of the position. The meeting agreed and thought that this might be put to the Company as a general point in connection with the concession. (g) Territ orial waters . The question was raised whether territorial waters were covered by the draft concession. It was agreed that they were included under the terms of Article 1. Article 5^ The Petroleum Department suggested that it would be desirable further to safeguard the interests of the Sheikh by amplifying this article on the general lines of Articles 12A and 13 (paragraphs 1 and 3) of the A.P.O.C.'s Persian concession, which provided for carrying out operations in a proper manner and also dealt with the keeping of plans, and other data which were to be made available to the Government. It was agreed that this should be put to the Ccmpery. Article 4 . Til i s article was likely to be that of the ■ -■ ■' '■ 1 11 _ .■■ in i - - greatest importance to the Sheikh. The Foreign Office representatives expressed the general view that, subject to consideration of our own interests and those of the Sheikh, it was desirable to meet the A.P.O.C. so far as possible over the terms of this concession since any delay in settlement increased the risk that American interests might be brought in. The Petroleum Department agreed, and the Admiralty said that they thought their higher authorities would probably also agree, subject to the reservations in question, as did Mr.Laithwaite. Mr.Laithwait e said that the Company had already made it clear that they did not wish to disclose their bargaining figures at the monent and we could not very well press them to do so. On the other hand, it would be material, in considering the terms to be accepted, that under the present concession they were to receive an exclusive licence in respect of the whole area of Qatar - some 3,000 square miles. Mr.Starling said that the use of the phrase 'exported from or sold for consumption in' raised an important point. This formula was one which had been used in the Persian concession. The/5. The effect would be that the Company would not pay royalty on ary oil used locallyi on wastage, on loss in refining if done in Qatar, or on oil which might be returned to ground. He had regarded the point as so material that he had taken the instructions of higher authority on it. As a result he expressed the oDinion that it was unnecessary to take exception to it, so long as the financial terms offered by the Company proved adequate, (i.e. such as adequately to safeguard the Sheikh's interests after taking into account the possible effect on his receipts of the fact that royalty would be paid not on all oil produced, but only on such oil as was exported from or sold for consumption in Qatar) though it seemed desirable that the Sheikh should fully understand what was involved. Articl e 5. In the light of Mr.Starling 1 s statement on Article 4 it was agreed that no question need be raised as to the use of the words 'exported from or sold for consumption in' instead of some phrase such as 'produced'. Article 6. (a.) It was agreed that it would be desirable to make the provisions of this article specifically subgect to the compensation provisions of Article 7 (as in the case of Article 2 of the revised draft)- (b) Considerable discussion took place as to the risks involved in giving the Company an absolute right, as in the terms of the article, in any circumstances, to construct conmunications, railways, refineries, etc. The meeting were reminded of the difficulties which had arisen in Hasa in connection with the provision of landing grounds for aeroplanes^ and elsewhere in Saudi Arabia in connection with wireless. Local prejudices and the danger of inflaming the Bedouin had been alleged by Ibn Saud as a reason for postponing action or refusing concessions. If similar difficulty arose in Qatar our position, if it proved necessary for us to intervene in support of the Cempany, might be difficult. On the other hand, the Company would clearly require sane definite provision that they ' 1 , ||||| | L | u l l u -_ rr r . ^ _ had liberty to erect such buildings, etc., as were essential for6. their purpose, erefineries, pumping stations, harbours, pipelines, workshops, etc. The meeting was inclined to think that the simplest course might be to draw a distinction between constructions of this nature and communications taken in a broad sense - wireless, roads, railways, etc. - and that in discussions with the Company we should aim in the first place at making the Company's rights under the first sub-paragraph of the article subject 'to the agreement of the Sheikh which shall not be unreasonably withheld'. (The Petroleum Department did not wish to support any arrangement which gave the Sheikh the right to interfere with the construction of any works See . necessary to the operations of the Company, and pointed out that roads, small- gauge railways and telephones were an essential part of any large scale operations.) If this proved impossible to endeavour to make a special exception in respect of conmunications and wireless, putting them on a different footing from the other matters referred to. It was thought that here, as in the case of Article 2, the importance of walking extremely carefully, having regard to local conditions, might be impressed on the Company. ( c ) Mr.Warner raised the question whether steps should be taken to secure the participation of the political authorities in dealings between the Company and the Sheikh after the granting of the Concession. Mr.Laithwaite t while agreeing as to the j desirability in principle of ensuring this, drew attention to the j difficulty of requiring or enforcing it so long as we had no resident political representative in C^atar. Article 7^ ( a ) was a g ree&lt; i that the desirability of specifically safeguarding the position of any aerodromes acquired 0 u us in Qatar should be considered in connection with this article. (b) Attention was drawn to the possibility that considerable ^reas might be in the possession, not of the Sheikh, but (as ppeared in the past to have been the case elsewhere on the Arab littoral) of the Jowasimi Arabs* That was, however, a point for the C ompany.The second sub-paragraph was too widely stated and did not sufficiently safeguard private possessors against expropriation at the request of the Company. It was agreed that the Company should be invited either to adopt a wording on the general lines of Article 4 (B)(2) of their Persian concession or to revise the first sentence of the sub-paragraph to run as follows;- 'Any other lands, houses or buildings required by the Company may be bought or leased by it with the consent of and on conditions to be arranged with the proprietors thereof, but the terms of such purchase or lea-se shall not be in excess. ...' (d) The phrase f 'Such land shall at all times be less than the whole area of Qatar' caused some surprise, but was assumed to have been inserted at the request of the Sheikh. 4I.V.A.9..L1. It was agreed that the Company should be invited to insert in the second sentence of the first sub paragraph the words 'subject to the same proviso'. Article 10. (a) Some discussion took place as to the desirability of fixing a maximum period during which the general custans exemption granted to the Company should run. The general feeling of the meeting was, however, in favour of letting the article stand, particularly now that the Company had to some extent met us by agreeing t# pay duty on food supplies, personal goods, clcthing and general merchandise imported by it for the personal use of its employees. (b) The question was raised of the desirability of giving the Company complete exemption in respect of harbour dues. The meeting felt that as any harbours made would be developed by the Company, it would be unreasonable to request them to pay harbour dues. On the other hand it would be worth ensuring that they vould agree to the free use of such harbours by the Sheikh. Goods imported by private individuals through such harbours/harbours would of course 'be liable for any ordinary import duty ciis^r^edj out it would D6 unr^ason^ibls to give the Sheikh the right to charge harbour dues in addition in respect of the importation of such goods.* Article 11 * Attention Yv r as drawn to the correspondence which had taken place between the Political Resident and Mr. alkington, ana also to the fact that under Article 3 of the Qatar Treaty of 1916 the sneikh was precluded from obtaining arms, save under- arrangements therein defined, to be made and approved by H.M.G. It was agreed that the Resident's view in the matter ? as expressed in paragraph 3(1} of his letter aated 24th November to Mr. Elkington, should be accepted. Article 12 . Assignment . It was recognised that this article raised fundamental questions and that no decision could be taken on it except after reference to higher authority. On the other hand it seemed desirable so far as possible to clear the ground with a view to exploring how far the Company were in fact prepared to go and -what their intentions were in the matter. It had throughout been appreciated that as the A.P.O.C. were conducting as agents negotiations in Qatar only/on behalf of the I.P.C., which vvcis itself an international Company containing a British, elemer which represented only about 3^. of the shareholders ^ it would not be possibl in practice to insert full British safeguards or provision ior fun British control in the concession granted. Mj! —Seal said that the Admiralty had originally proposed the following five safeguards designed to maintain British control: - (a) Tne assignee company to be registered in Great Britain; (b) The Company^ office in Great Britain to be run ^ a British subject; (c)//3 (c) British director; (d) Chief Local Representative to iDe p ersona grata to H.M.G. and a British subject. (e) As many British employees as possible to be employed. Of these, he thought that (a), (b) and (d) should appear in the concession itself, and in view of the necessity for transfer to the I.P.O., he suggested that the other two might be inserted if at any stage the I,P.O. decided to sell the concession to a foreign Company. For this purpose a clause should be inserted forbidding assignment without the consent of the Sheikh, and then only on conditions to be laid down*by him. Mr. Starling suggested that we might provide that the Company should be and remain a British Company registered in Great Britain, having its place of business in Great Britain and a British Chairman, on the same lines as the I.I.C., Mr.Laithwaite said that might be possible, but that he thought the India Office would be content ( if this was found to be sufficiently legally watertight and would ease matters) to cover certain of these points in an exchange of letters with the Company, particularly the || point about the Chief Local Representative. It seemed desirable also to provide that the Sheikh should approve the conditions of transfer. Mr.Seal said that apart altogether from safeguards for British control, the Admiralty were concerned that they should be in a position to acquire or buy the oil produced in time of war, and he was anxious therefore that there should be no reassignment to American interests without provision for pre-emption, as otherwise serious diplomatic difficulties might arise. Mr.Starling drew attention to the difficulties of entirely safeguarding the position when we were dealing with an international company such as the I.P.C • Sea -L s-S^eed that it was desirable to make provision that the consent of the Sheikh and approval of the conditions of assignment should be included. Mr.Warner suggested that the simplest course might be to meet the Company in so many words as regards transfer to c * that was the point which they had principally in mind in one first sentence of the article and then make provision to i t safeguard our position in the event of any reassignment.w 10. After considerable further discussion it was agreed that the Company should te invited to agree to a redraft of the first sub-paragraph of this article on the following lines: 'The Company shall oe ana remain a British Company registered in Great Britain, having its principal place of ■business in Great Britain, and the Chairman shall at all times De a British subject. Subject to these conditions and to the approval of the sheikh and on conditions to he laid down by him, it shall have the right to transfer this agreement to another commercial company etc.' It was also agreed that Mr. Warner's suggestion might be put to the Company. The meeting then considered the second sub-paragraph of Article 12. Air. Laithwaite said that it seemed most important that the terms on which the subsidiary commercial companies Rfiould be formed should be subiect to the orior approval of The meeting agreed. H.M.G. / Mr. Starling suggested that (following the example of the British Oil Development Concession) we might insert the words 'under its own control' after the words 'subsidiaiy commercial companies' and might also provide that any such companies should enjoy the rights and privileges and assume the engagements of the parent company. It was agreed that this snould be put to the A.P.O.C. On a general point Mr. Laithwaite said that it might be desirable to emphasise to the A.P.O.C. representatives th at whil e we were prepared to regard their draft concessiffi as generally satisfactory (subject to their meeting us over assignment, etc.) they were not to assume that if negotiations between the A.P.O.C. and the Sheikh broke down we were in any way permanently committed to these terms. If other competitors came into the field the competitive offers put up would have to be considered one agaihst another. The meeting agreed. Article 1311. Article 13 » It was agreed that the Company should be asked In suh-paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 to Insert provision that producing wells or borings should be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working. Article 15 . Mr. Laithwaite suggested that in the interests of the Sheikh it might be desirable to reword in lines 7 &amp; 8 after the word 'delayed' tiiis^Eo'fQft: 'A period oi such* aelay, together with such period as may be reasonably necessary in the view of the for the restoration Sec Political He siden^''.'TTTlvbula of course be open to the Sheikh to go to arbitration on the point, but something less ula.borK.t0 seemed preferable. The meeting agreed. Article 16 . Mr. Lalthwaite said that the India Office on general political grounds regarded it as undesirable that the third arbitrator should be nominated by the Court of International Justice at The Hague. Tney would much prefer the Political Resident (on whom this responsibility had devolved in the original draft). The meeting agreed that this should be put to the Company. (a) It was pointed out that this gave us no guarantee as to nationality of any non-Asiatic foreigners who might be introduced. Secondly, that serious political difficulties might well arise if the Company were to import, say, Bahreinis or Iraqis, to operate the C^itar concession, on the ground that the wages demanded locally were unreasonably high. It was agreed that tne Company should be invited to consider the omission of the words 'or demand unreasonable wages'. On the question of nationality of non-Asiatic employees, Mr.Praser had already made it clear that they could not commit themselves and it seemed difficult, important as the point was, to do more than had been done in Bahrein and endeavour to secure that as large a proportion as possible should be British. (b)/Ih 12. IvLr. Laithwaite said that (b) / ti is article raised th e diffic ult question of jurisdiction. The Company had rra.de it clear that they were not prepared to accede to the Sheikh's request that disputes between its employees and his subjects should be decided by him and it would probably be necessary to reach some agreement with him over the cession to H.M.G. of his jurisdiction over foreigners, though this was likely to be by no means easy. Mr. Warner said that here, as in the case of Articles 2 and 7, it was necessary to bear in mind the possible responsibility with which we might find ourselves burdened in connection with the protection of / foreign employees etc. In Qatar, and the contingent risk of foreign interference if we proved unable to safeguard their position adequately. Mr. Laithwaite expressed agreement and said that if the concession ?;as developed it seemed likely that we might have to consider some time in the future the appointment of a political officer to Qatar. (Canpare in this connection ccmment (o) on Article 6, ab ove). Article 18 . A similar article appears in the A*P.O.C, Persian concession and it was agreed that while its meaning was obscure it was unobjectionable. Article HQ . 'The Political Hesident had expressed the opinion' tha t a careful Arabic text migh t at a pinch representatives suifice. The Foreign Office^intimatad that the point was probably of less.general importance to them than if we had been aealing with the question of a treaty, but it would be well that we shoula not finally commit ourselves to the Company upon it. INDIA OFFICE, ssnd December 1933.p.Z. 8329/33. INDIA OFFICE, fill TEH AIL, S.W.I. 29th December 1933* nnnfidentialy Dear Mr.Hearn, The revised draft of the concession which the Anglo -Persian Oil Canpany are anxious to secure in respect of the State of Qatar which was. ccmrnunicated to us at our meeting with you and Mr.Fraser on the 11th December has now been examined by the Departments concerned. As you will see frcm what follows there are certain points on which we are not yet in a position to let you know in detail the views of His Majesty's Government. But we are anxious to facilitate and expedite so far as possible the course of your negotiations with the Sheikh of Q,atar and we hope that, even if further discussion is necessary 'between the Company and the representatives of His Majesty's Government on certain points, the information contained in this letter will give you a general idea of the position, and will enable you to give the necessary instructions without delay to Mr.Chisholm. Procedure. We should like in the first place to make certain suggestions as regards procedure. You will remember that in the course of the discussion on 14th December the attention of the Company was drawn to His Majesty's Government's desire to safeguard certain matters such as air, wireless and telegraphic arrangements, the relations of the Company with the Sheikh and the local representatives of His Majesty's Government etc» , and the suggestion was made on your side that it would be preferable that matters such as these should not be included in the actual agreement between the Ccmpany and the Sheikh and that they might equally satisf act orily/ ►Hearn, Esq. , ^•glo-Persian Oil Company, Britannic House , Pinsbury Circus , S.C,2.2. satisfactorily 'be disposed of by a..n excliange of letters between the Company and His Majesty's Government. As the result of further consideration we now think that the simplest course would be that there should be two agreements, the first between the Company and the Sheikh, the second between the Company and His Majesty's Government. The Agreement between the Canpany and the Sheikh would be essentially a commercial agreement which would deal with canmercial points only and would not include anything of a purely political character. It would, however, contain a clause to the effect that it should not come into force until His Majesty's Government had given their written consent to it. This would be in accordance with the Sheikh's treaty obligations and difficulty should not therefore arise so far as he is concerned in agreeing to it. Subject to this and to the modifications discussed below such an agreement could probably be substantially identical with the 'revised draft agreement' which we are now considering. 3. The proposed second Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Company - the conpletion of which would be a conditixjn of the approval of His Majesty's Government to the first, or Canmercial Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh - would cover points of special interest to His Majesty's Government. We think on the whole that a formal agreement would be a more satisfactory method of dealing with these questions than an exchange of letters, though on the understanding that legal effect could be given to any undertakings embodied in an exchange of letters and that such undertakings would be binding on any assignee, transferee or subsidiary company formed to operate the C^atar concession, as veil as on the original concessionaire, we should not regard the/1 /O 1/ z. the question of form as one of vital importance. The matters which His Majesty's Government, as at present advised, contemplate that such an agreement would cover are set out in paragraph 5 and following 'below. I ought to make it clear that it is intended that the conditions to 'be emloodied in this Agreement would 'be condititns which would apply not merely t^ your Company or another British concessionaire, but to any company, of whatever nationality, which may endeavour to secure an oil concession in Qatar. 4. Amendments in 'revised draft concession '. For convenience these have been set out in the ■L - , — enclosure to this letter. Save in respect of Article 12, on which, as you will remember, it proved impossible to roach agreement at our discussion on December 14th, and of a suggeation on Article 2, they are substantially identical with those which were th-sn provisionally agreed between us and which you have already communicated to Mr. Chisholm, though there are two or three points of minor importance which were not included in your communication to Mr. Chisholm and which, according to our record, were discussed at our meeting. ^' Content of special Agreement between Anglo-Persian 0.^1 Com pany and His Majesty's Government . I now turn to the question of the matters to be included in the special agreement or exchange of letters referred to in paragraph 3 above between His Majesty's Government and the Company. As already explained the requirements of His Majesty's Government under this head will apply equally to any company, whatever its nationality, which may seek to obtain an oil concession in Qatar. As you will appreciate, certain of these matters involve c onsiderati on/4. consideration of points of some difficulty on which it will 'be necessary to consult the Government of India and the Politieal Resident in the Persian Gulf before His Majesty's Government can reach a final decision. Partly for this reason, and partly because in the short time at our disposal it has been impossible to be certain that we have exhausted the various aspects of the matters in question, we propose at this stage to indicate them only in general outline. We will in due course, and I hope before very long, let you have a statement in greater detail and possibly in a form suitable for inclusion in an agreement of the nature which we suggest, and we shall, of course, be ready to discuss matters further if on receipt of that statement the position seems to you obscure in any respect or there are any points you wish to raise. 6. We are anxious in the first place to secure an understanding that any sites which His Majesty's Government may select for aeroplane or seaplane bases in Qatar in the future (at the moment there is merely an informal arrangement in regard to a particular landing ground at Dohah) shall be secure from interference. As was mentioned in our discussion on 14th December an. undertaking of this nature has been given by the American interests which are operating the Bahrein oil concession. The understanding would equally apply to harbours in the perhaps improbable event of His Majesty's Government deciding at a later stage for any reason to develop a harbour in Q,atar, and it would be necessary also to cover the question of wireless and telegraphic communications. 7. Secondly, as you will remember, we have emphasised in the discussions which we have had on the question of this/^ V: i/ 5. this concession the very special political conditions of 11,1 ^ ' Qatar. As you Imovj, it is practically unexplored 'by Europeans; its hinterland is unadministared, its -people are backward, scattered, and unfamiliar mtii the elements of ordinary v^estern civilization; danger of serious political trouble, responsibility for dealing mtli x^hich would fall back on His Majesty's Government, in connection with the Company^ activities in so far as these might either cause misunderstanding on the part of the local inhabitants or in any v^ay affect religious or similar institutions or buildings, cannot be overlooked, and a further complication arises from the fact that the boundaries of the State of Qatar are undelimited. His Majesty 1 s Government regard it as most important in these circumstances that there should be a clear understanding with the Company (vyhich would, of course, extend to any assignee, transferee, or subsidiary company working the concession) that they will undertake to pay due deference at all times to the wishes of the Sheikh (which His C — , r I ' ' Majesty^ Government will on their side see are not unreasonable in character) and to the advice of the political representatives of His Majesty^ Government in the Persian Gulf, whether stationed in Qatar or not• Thirdly, while iiye are not yet in a position to make a positive proposal to you on this point, it is not improbable that His Majesty^ Government as at present advised will require provision to secure the same degree of British control as has been discussed with you in the case of the parent or of any transferee Company, in respect of 9-^y subsidiary companies operating the concession, of the nature embodied in sub-clause 1 of the tentative redraft of Article 12 of the revised concession which you drew up at our/our meeting on December 14th, In particular it^will be regarded as essential to secure that the concession is operated locally 'by British personnel exclusively. Pr ovision would also have t o be made in regard to the nationality and position of the Chief Local Representative of the operating Company (this would .of course include the question of the channel of conmunication between the Chief Local Representative and the Sheikh), the refining of oil won either locally in Qatar or in British neighbouring territory, and the right of pre-emption in time of war. These are all matters which can, we think, best be included in a separate agreement between the Ccmpany and His Majesty's Government which would be communicated to the Sheikh but to which he would not be a party: and we feel that, other considerations apart, such an arrangement may facilitate the task of negotiating a ccmmercial agreement with him. 9. I hope the information contained in this letter, inccmplete or provisional in character as it inevitably still is on certain important points, will meet your purpose. If there is anything on which you are not clear, perhaps you would be so kind as to let me know. I should be grateful if you would let me know the views of the Company on the procedure suggested, and if you would confirm that they are prepared to accept the amendments to the 'revised' concession set out in the enclosure to this letter, and also the understandings subject to which certain amendments have been inserted or omitted. On one further point, which was mentioned in the course of our discussions, I ought perhaps to put on record that while the draft Agreement, with the modifications and subject to the supplementary Agreement proposed, would in present/7 present circumstances te generally acceptable to His Majesty's Government,- it would of course be understood that they are not permanently canmitted to the terms in question and that should the present negotiations between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Sheilch break down, or any other material alteration in the situation take place (such as the appearance of a competing company) they must reserve themselves full liberty of action.p.Z.8329/33 v&gt; Note of amendments proposed in 'Reyised Draft Concession 11 oommunicated unofficially ^ t^e Anglo-Persian Oil Company to the r^presentatiyes of His Majesty's Government at the India Office on the 11th December 1933 • Preamble. No comment. ArticleNo comment. Article 2. ( a ) ££ the position of air etc. facilities is safeguarded in the separate agreement or exchange of letters between the Company and Kis Majesty's Government referred to in paragraph 3 of the covering letter it will be umecessary to make special provision in this article. (b) it is understood th:.t the words ,T or such normal extensions thereof as might be indicated by the Sheikh' refer to religious lands and religious buildings. The following redraft is suggested to make the position clear:- 'or such normal extensions of such religious lands, cemeteries, or buildings, as the Sheikh may indicate.....' (c) In addition to the amendments above we should like to suggest the omission of a reference to a map, at any rate at this stage. The precise boundaries of Qatar are at the moment under investigation by the political authorities. It is hoped that a very early decision v /ill be reached regarding them and a map can best be produced and attached when agreement has been reached on this point. \\ The point could best be met by the omission of the words '(as shown/a, shown generally on the' map annexed hereto)', (d) The Company have agreed to omit thewords at the end of tre first sub-paragraph 'and any sub s e cm e nt exte ns i o ns the reof.' Article 3 . The Company agreed to consider amplification of this article on the lines of Articles 1£A and 13 of their Persian concession, subject to certain verbal modifications. We suggest that the article might be reyised to read somewhat as follows; - '3. The Company shall make a thorough investigation of the State of Qatar by such methods as may in its opinion best enable it to ascertain its oil possibilities. In carrying out its operations under this Agreement the Company shall employ all means customary and proper and shall exploit its Concession by methods in accordance with the latest scientific progress. 'The Company undertakes to keep accurate of wells,dri11ed plans, maps, records /and sucn other data whether topographical, geological or of drilling as it is customary to keep and such material shall be open to inspection by the Sheikh or his duly authorised representative 'The Company shall supply an annual report to the Sheikh of its operations under this Agre ement.' iirticle 4. it was agreed on December 14th that so long as (a) the financial terrns to be given to the Sheikh under this article were such as/3. as to give full weight to the fact that the Company would obtain an e xclusive concession over the whole area 01 Qatar, which appears to be rather over 3,000 square miles, without specific drilling obligations or without any definite obligation in the event of oil being proved to proceed to commercial production within a given time, and (b) the Sheikh fully understood that the effect of acceptance ofthe royalty formula pro posed would be that royalty would have to be paid only on oil actually exported from or sold for consumption in Qatar and not on the oil production, no modification of this article need be suggested. Article 5 . Hocomment. Article In the 5th line of the Article the words 11 as it may require Ir appear to have been omitted. The Company agreed at the meeting on 14th De c emb e r (a) to insert the words 'subject to the pro visions of Article 7' after the word 'right' in the first line ofthis article; (b) to insert at the end of the first sub- paragraph the words 'but not otherwise' after the words 'for the purposes of its operations'; (c) The question of a special safeguard in respect of telegraphic and wireless installations was discussed in connection with this clause. We do not wish to press that this should be specifically covered in the Commercial Agreement with the Sheikh so long as it is understood that it will be included in the separate agreement to be concluded between the Company and His Majesty 1 s Government. (a)/0 4. (d) On a separate point, the Company^ representatives were very reluctant to agree to any specific safeguard for the political interests involved or for the position of the Sheikh in the clause, and the suggestion was made that it might be possible to meet the difficulties felt by the interested Departments of His Majesty 1 s Government by an exchange of letters in which the Company would undertake to give all due deference to the views of His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh in the exercise of their rights under this article, 'To this we understood that the Company^ representatives agreed and so long as it is understood that the point will be covered in a separate agreement between the Company and His Majesty's Government we do not wish to press for its insertion here. Article 7 . (a) So long as the safeguards desired by His Majesty's Government in respect off air facilities etc. are dealt with in a separate agreement betv/een His Majesty's Government and the Company, no modification of the first sub-paragraph of this article to cover this point will be necessary. (b) The Company have agreed to insert 'with the consent of and' after the words 'leased by it' in the opening sentence of sub-paragraph 2. We suggest on a point of drafting that in the same sentence the words 'but the terms ox such purchase or lease shall not be in excess' etc. should be substituted/l/l 5. substituted for the words 'but such conditions shall not be in excess.' Article Sub-paragraph (i). Second sentence• The Company have agreed to insert the words 'subject to the same conditions'. Article 10 , In connection with this article it was understood at the meeting on the 14-th December that the Company would see no objection to the addition of a proYision in this article or perhaps more appropriately in Article 6 to the effect that the Sheikh 'shall have the right to use harbours utilised or constructed by the Company, provided that such use in no way hampers the Company or interferes with the safety of its operations,' Article 11 . It was agreed in connection Y /ith this article that there could be no question of acceding to the Sheikh f s request that rifles should be supplied by the Company. Article Ik:. At the meeting on 14th December Mr.Hearn, after considerable discussion, suggested the following redraft, which might, he thought, be acceptable to the Iraq Petroleum Company, but beyond which he was not prepared to go: - ' Article 12 . The Company shall have the right to transfer this agreement 1 d any other British commercial company, but not to any government, subject to such Company being- able to fulfil all the duties and obligations of this, agreement. The Company shall inform the Sheikh if it so transfers this agreement. Such other commercial company shall be and remain/y @ 6. remain a British company, registered in Great Britain, haying its principalplaoe of business in Great Britain, and the Chairman shall at all times be a British subject,' If The Company shall be at liberty to form one or more subsidiary companies under its own control should it consider this to be necessary for the working of this concession. Any such subsidiary company shall, so far as they are applicable to its operations, enjoy all the rights and priYileges granted to the Company hereunder, and shall assume all the engagements and responsibilities herein expressed, except the engagement expressed in the final sentence of the : preceding clause,' The redraft in question has been further considered by the interested Departments of His Majesty 1 s Government, Their position in regar- to British control, British exploitation, the position and nationality of the Chief Local Representative, etc. in any oil concession in Qatar is referred to in paragraph 8 of the covering letter, though, as there stated, they are notyet in a position to set out their minimum conditions in so many words. So far as the commercial agreement between the Company and the Sheikh is concerned they would however be content to accept as Article 12 the first two sentences of sub-paragraph 1 of Mr.Iiearn 1 s_ redraft and sub-paragraph 2 of the same redraft less the words 'except the engagement expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause and to omit any reference to British, control from the commercial/3/ © 7. commercial agreement with the Sheikh so long as it was understood that the question would be covered in a separate agreement between HJUG. and the Gompany. On a point of drafting, it is suggested that the word 'Agreement' be substituted for the word 'Concession' 1 in the first sentence of sub-para.2 of the redraft. f fticle 13 . The Gompany agreed, subject to discussion with the Shell Gompany, to the insertion in sub-para 2 of a provision that ^producing wells or borings at the time of such termination shall be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working'* and to make a corresponding amendment in substitution for the words 'in such working condition as the property then is' in sub~para. 2 and 3. We have not yet heard the result of their discussion; but we note that Article 20 (II) and (ill) of the revised Persian Concession requires wells to be handed over in good order and that there appear to be no lack of precedents for a provision of this nature (e.g. in the Brunei concession, which is operated by the Shell Company, Clause 19 reads: '19. The Lessees shall (save in respect of any operations of which the Lessor shall have sanctioned the abandonment) at the end or sooner determination of the said term deliver up to/8. to the Lessor in good order repair and condition and fit for farther working- all productive wells or borings which shall have, been made by the Lessees under-the liberty and power in that behalf herein before contained..'; while the Iraq concessions both of the I.P.O. and the British Oil Development provide that H the Company shall maintain in good working order all wells drilled so long as they are economically productive.') Article 15 . It was suggested to the Company, who, it is understood, saw no objection, that the words 'the period of such delay, together with any such period as may be necessary for the restoration of' might be amended, in the interests of the Sheikh, to read ; 'the period of such delay together with such period as may be reasonably necessary, subject to the approval (or in the view) of the Political Besident, for the restoration, etc.' Article Ifi. It was made clear at the meeting on 14th December that H.LUG. attached importance to the restoration of the Political Besident in substitution for the Court of International Justice as the person to be responsible for nominating the third arbitrator. It was understood that the Company saw no objection to this. while attaching importance to the modification, see no objection to the Company's postponing communication of it to the/the Sheikh until their negotiations with him have reached a more advanced stage, Yfoen such a communication is made they are equally willing that the Company should inform the Sheikh that the modification is made at the request of H.M.G., who have intimated that it is in accordance with the practice in other Persian Gulf oil concessions and that they must make it an essential condition of any concession granted to any company. Article 17 . (a) The Company agreed, in the second sentence of the article, to add the word 'suitable' before the word 'labourers' in line 5, and to delete the words 'ur demand unreasonable wages,' (b) They have also indicated that they would welcome the exercise of jurisdiction by H.IvUGr. and that they are not prepared to accede to the Sheikh f s request that he should exercise jurisdiction in disputes between their employees and his subjects. The question of jurisdiction is one which can most suitably be decided in direct discussion between the Sheikh and rLM.G. If necessary a reference can be made to the position in the agreement proposed between the Company and HJUG, (c) The question of the nationality of the exploiting personnel arises for consideration in connection with this article./^ 4r IP w 10. article. This, as indioated in para.8 of the covering letter, is a matter which, in the view of can most suitably be covered in the agreement to be reached between them and the Company, and on the understanding that it will be disposed of in that connection the'/ do not desire to suggest any modification of the terms of the article. It may, however, be placed on record that the American interests which are operating the Bahrein oil concession have agreed to a provision in respect of the employment of British personnel. It is understood that the Company propose to stand out for an Arabic and an English text. INDIA OFFICE, 29th December, 1933.CONFIDENTIAL.

My dear Starling, I write to say tiiat it is now proposed *ehat oar meeting to discuss Qatar oil s&amp;oald take place here at 4.30 tomorrow afternoon, I hope by then to have circulated the record of our discussion with fraser and Hearn on the 14th December. 2. !l?he main points in issue are, I t.:ink, the folloviiing:- (a) Safeguards for aerodromes and comnonications in Article Z and 6. (b) A rticl e IE. (c) Article 17, in so far as that affects the introduction of non-British personnel# 3. fhe Company in our discussions Tfith them appeared billing to consider an exchange of letters to govern certain points (particularly those mentioned in connection T3ith Articles Z and 6 and the general Question of their relations with our local representatives and vdth the Bheikh). It will, of ooiirse, be essential, that any undertakings reached between the A.P*0«G* (acting as agents for the I.P.C*) and us should in the first place be legally binding on the Company and secondly should be transferred to and become binding on any assignee company #iioh might be formed to exploit the concession. It would, in fact, I think, be preferable that they should constitute a separate agreement between the Company and , dealing ^ith points of concern primarily to the Company and H.M.G. rather than to the Company and the Sheikh. 4. The points raised by Articles IE and 17 fall into tvv'o categories: C.Starling Esq., (a) Petroleum Department, Mines .Department, Dean Stanley St., S.W.I.© (a) safeguards sucia as t&amp;e ri ght of preemption in time of war, the obligation to establisli a refinery locally, etc. ('b) - a point of mucii political .importance to us, and, I siiould tMnlc, also to the foreign Office - the nationality of the personnel to exploit the concession end to represent tiie Company in Qatar• 5 # fhe first cet^gcry of desiderata is closely involved vaitii major questions of oil policy and it may well oe chat it would be difficult to reach any early decision about them, though ^e might mention to the Company the desirability of local refining without farther delay in view of our experience in Bahrein. 6. As regards the second category, the more we think about this concession the greater are the potential political liabilities of H.M.G.in connection with it, whether it goes to the A 4 P.O.G.,aB we should prefer, or, as we hope may not be the case, to some wholly non-British body such as the Standard Oil of California. We are inclined increasingly to think that, having regard to possible political difficulties to the undeveloped and uncivilised condition of Qatar and to the complications which might arise were foreign personnel to suffer, it would be essential not only that the Company shall always be represented by a Chief Local Represent at ive who shall be a British subject persona grata to H«M«G»and whose appointment shall have been approved by them, but that the exploiting personnel, in so far as local native labour is not concerned, shall be wholly British (an arrangement coul^ossibly be made as regards one or two individuals). Our own very provisional view at the moment is that it would be well to lay this down as a principle to apply equally to any concessionaire who may secure a concession in Qatar,i.e. whether/M ( whether It is tiie A^P.O^C., the I«P«C. f or the Standard Oil of California, and to justify oar actionem the ground of local oiroumstances and our special treaty relations i5ith the Sheikh. Bat the best line might 'be (I think the Foreign Office vaould probably agree) that we should tomorrow, if the meeting agrees, as a first more, inform the Company that the redraft left with us by Hearn of Article IE would leave the Company completely free immediately on the transfer of the concession to them by the A.P.O.C* to form subsidiary companies to operate the concession, which woald be wholly foreign; that while we quite accept their readiness to meet us so far as possible, it is essential in a document such as the present to put the position beyond doubt, and that we should regard it as essential that any assignee company should comply with the provisions of the last sentence of the first sub-paragraph of Article IE as redrafted by Hearn; secondly that it is essential that both the Chief Local Hepresentative and the non-Asiatic personnel to operate this concession should be British. 7.

Final note of discussion at the Inaia Office on Thursday, 14th December, between representatives of the A.P.O.G. and representatives of the petroleum Department and India Office on the subject of the A.P.O.G. redraft of the qatar Present ;- Mr. Lalthwaite (In the Chair) Mr. F.C. Starling Petroleum Department. Mr. Praser Deputy Chairman, A.P.O.G. Mr. riearn A.P.O.C. Mr. G.E. Crombie India Office. The meeting followed irmiediately on the interdepartment al meeting, a note of which has been circulated under P^Z.8073/33. Mr. Praser was present only for the first jT^half of the discussion. The note which follows records the points on which agreement was reached with the Company anu deals in greater detail with the discussion which took place on the question of Article 12. It was made clear to the representatives of the A.P.O.C, before the discussion began that while the draft concession had been informally examined interdepartmentally the results oi that examination had not yet been laid before higher authority and that the discussion would proceed on that basis. On the other hand, it was understood that the Company would welcome any immediate indication of the points on which difficulty was likely to be felt by H.M.G., so that they could inform Mr, Ghisholm, in the event of 'is resuming negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar before nth December, of the line which he should take. Article 2/2. ArfTICLii] 2. (a) The Company were Informed that while H.M.G. had not as yet any regular aerodrome in Qatar it was to te anticipated that aerodromes would be established there in the future and they were anxious to secure safeguards in respect of them from the Coffipany. They had secured similar safeguards from the Bahrein Petroleum Company, by en exchange of letters, in the case of Bahrein. H.M.G. would probably also wish to obtain a similar understanding that any wireless arrangements which they might make in the future would not be obstructed by the opera-tions of the Company. Mr. Praser was very averse from the inclusion of any specific provision in Article 2 to cover these points, but thought tnat they could be satisfactorily disposed of by an e xchange of letters. It was agreed that the India Office should suggest drafts to the company. (b) The Company agreed tnat the words 'or such normal extensions thereof as might be indicated by the Sheikh' referred to religious lands and religious buildings. They were understood to be willing to improve the drafting 33 as to make this clear. (c) The Company agreed to omit at the end of the iirst sud -paragraph the words 'and any subsequent extensions thereof.' AfiTIGL^S. Mr. Starling pointed out to the Company that the article as it stood was very vague. It seemed desiraole to amplify it on the lines of Articles 12/1 and ^ (first and thira paragraphs) of the Company's Persian concession, so as to make more specific their obligation to pursue the development of the oil resources of the t errit ory ana to use the latest scientific measures in doing/3. doing so. Mr. Praser indicated that the Company x ^eluctant to assume definite drilling obligations and that no reference had therefore heen made to such obligations in the article. These obligations if undertaken would be very expensive to the Company and if they did not result in production of no benefit to the Sheikh. They would much prefer to improve the financial terms given to the sheikh. It was pointed out to him that if drilling operations were unsuccessful the Company had the right to determine the concession after notice under the conditions of Article 13. After further discussion the Company agreed to consider amplification of this article on the lines of Articles 12A and 13 of the Persian concession subject to certain verbal modifications. This would involve the acceptance by them of an obligation to carry out operations in a proper manner and to keep plans ana other data which vv'ould be rrade available to the Government. Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that under the concession as drafted the Company would obtain an exclusive concession over the whole area of Qatar, apparently rather more than 3,000 square miles. This clearly was a fact which we should have to take into consideration in considering whether the financial terms, when these were communicated to us, were satisfactory. It was obvious that if the Sheikh were to grant them a mining lease in respect of a portion of his territory only ne would be at liberty (as had happened in the case of the Sheikh of Bahrein) to entertain competing offers from other oil interests in respect of the balance of the territory. He also drew attention to the fact that the draft/4. draft emtodisci the formula which appeared In the case of the Persian concession in respect of the payment of royalty, the effect feeing that royalty would have to be paid only on oil actually exported from or sold for consumption in Qatar and not on the oil produced. Mr, Praser said that in his view the provision was a perfectly fair one. Certain grades of oil products -j- often involved in certain conditions loss in manufacture. For example, if there were an expanding narket for motor spirit dut not for heavier products, it was to everyone's advantage that as much of the light stuff should he sold as possible. This would be impracticable if the Company had to pay a royalty on all oil tnat was produced. The A.P.O.C. had for some time overcome this difficulty by returning the ' heavier products to the ground where they once again aosoroed light products and gases. Persian Government had accepted the formula now suggested after a full discussion. Mr. Starling said that the adoption of this forffiu_a represented a new departure and was regarded as a matter of considerable importance. He had therefore taken instructions on it. It was obvious that the adoption of uhc formula suggested might have a material effect on the financial consideration granted to the Sheikh, He did not suggest that the arrangement was a bad one so long as the Sheikh appreciated what it meant. After further discussion it was agreed that the prov ision might be allowed to stand. The official representatives emphasised the importance of making clear o0 ^ :ie Sh e ikh what exactly was involved in it. Mr. Praser 'aid that he thought the sheikh fully unaerstood its effect. Article 5/AriTICLiC 6 . (a) The Company agreed to make the provisions of this article specifically subject to the Compensatory provision of Article 7. (b) Mr. Laithwaite emphasised the possibility of political difficulties arising if tne article was allowed go stano in its pre sen u lorni, and developed the argument on the lines which had been agreed by the preceding official interdepartmental conference. He suggested that the rights granted under the first sub-paragraph of Article 6 should be made 'subject to the agreement of the Sheikh, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.' The A.F.O.C. representatives said that they could not agree to ohis. me only effect would be tnat the Sheikh would hold the Company to ransom each time the necessity for his approval arose, in their view the phrase 'which shall not be unreasonably withheld' was one which in practice was no safeguard. Their experience of the Sheikh went to show that he would lose no opportunity of opening his mouth as wide as possible. Mr. Hearn added that provision on the oarne lines was included in the Company's Persian agreement, Mr. laithwaite said that that might be so, but that the political position in Qatar, with its wide hinterland and its extremely backward condition and semi- ivilised inhabitants, was entirely different from that Pv.roia or Iraq, where there was a central government and or less effective control by that government over the mole country, it was understandable that the Company snoula wish for some safeguard in respect of their technic^ establishments, such as refineries, workshops, etc., but it Aas conceivable that serious difficulties might arise in the event of their wishing to operate inland or to establish/@ 6 • establish wireless stations, etc. Mr. Starling pointed out that in the Hasa agreement the arrangement of air facilities was specifically left to he settled in a subsequent agreement. The official representatives suggested that as a compromise it might be possible to distinguish between essential oil operations (which might Include telephones for local coraiiunication) and general cornmunlcations such as telegraph and wireless. The Company's representatives were very reluctant to agree. Air. Lalthwalte said that there were important political interests to be safeguarded which we could not overlook. He did not know that there was anything very material in the form of the understanding reached with the Company so long as it was binding. If it would ease matters it might be possible to meet the situation oy an exchange of letters, in which the Company would undertake to give all due deference to the views of H.M.G. and the Sheikh in the exercise of their rights under this article. Die Company agreed to this suggestion. They iurther accepted a suggestion that the words 'but not otherwise' should be added after the words 'for the purposes of its operations' in line 5 of Article 6. (c) The Company said that sub-paragraph (11) of Article 6 had been inserted in deference to the Sheikh's vlews, ARTIOLK : 7 . (a) it was agreed that if the safeguards desired by hJk.G. in respect of aerodromes were ultimately not includea in the agreement but embodied in an exchange of letters, a moalficatlon of the first sub-paragraph of this article would oe unnecessary. The attention of the Company was drawn/7. drawn to the fact that the ownership of certain areas in Qatar might vest in a trihe and. not in the Sheikh. (b) sub-paragraph (ii), me Goinpany after discussion agreed to the revision of the opening sentence to run; •Any other lands, houses or buildings required by the Company may be bought or leased by it with the consent and on conditions to be arranged with the proprietors thereof, but theterms of such purchase or lease shall not be in excess, etc.' (c) The phrase 'and such land shall at all times be less than the whole area of Qatar' had, the Company stated, been inserted by the sheikh. ARTICLE 8 &gt; Sub-paragraph (i). secona sentence. Hie Company agreed to make this sentence subject to the same proviso as that set out in the first sentence. Amaa 10 . In connection with this article the question was raised whether the Company's operations should be free of huroour due s and what the position of the sheikh would be in respect of any harbours which they might develop in ■i ar for their own purposes. Mr, Hearn saw no objection to the aaciition of a provision that the Sheiich 'shall have right to use harbours utilised or constructed by the i'Pany provided that such use in no way hampers the Company or Interferes with the safety of Its operations.- 'P essed the opinion that it was not improbable that regular harbour might be developed since oil exported u Ds ^ken out to sea by a submarine pipe and ' 1&amp; t iri ^Sht be necessary woula be a pier for landing Purposes. Article 11/5-0 8, article ii &gt; Mr# Laithwaite referrsd to ths correspondence which had taken place between Mr. Elkington and the Political Resident'on the subject of the Sheikh's request to he supplied with rifles etc. hy the Company. He said that H.M#G# agreed with the views expressed by the Resident, and that in any case the Sheikh's request was in contravention of his treaty obligations. Mr* Praser said that the Company quite agreed that there could be no qiiestion of meeting the Sheikh's request on this point and that this had been made clear to Mr. Chisholm. AgTIGLj] J2. Mr. Laithwaite said that he wished to repeat that this article, which was obviously of great importance, was one on which H.M.G. could not commit themselves at the present stage. At the same time lie and Mr. starling would be glad uo 1 discuss it with ths Company with a view to clearing the ground so far as possible. It has been recognised that the Company were negotiating in Qatar on behalf of the I.p.c., shich was an international oody with a British percentage substantially less than half of the share holding, and Ivir, Praser had made it clear at a recent meeting that the foreign interests represented in the I.P.C. could claim a voice in proportion to their interest in the operation of any concessions which might be granted. Tne question of safeguards had, however, never been discussed in any retail in connection with the Company's negotiations and while difficulty need not probably be anticipated as regards formal transfer of any concession ivd to the I.p .c. , would probably attach the greatest importance to securing that the exploitation of the concession/concession was by British personnel and that certain other safeguards lor its British character were included: notably, that the Company should he registered in Great Britain, with offices in London, and a British Chairman, and probably that a proportion of its Board should be British. It would als3 be necessary to consider the question of the Chief Local Representative in Qatar, but that could be considered separately. He thought that it would also be considered desirable that the approval of the Sheikh should be required to any assignment. He suggested that Article 12 might be amended to read 'The Company shall be and remain a British Company, registered in Great Britain, and the Ghairman shall at all times be a British suoject. Subject to tnese conditions and to th6 approval of the Sheikh and on conditions laid down by him, it shall have the right to transfer this agreement to any other coranercial company, but not to any government, subject to such company being able to fulfil all the duties and obligations of this agreement. Ihe Company shall inform the Sheikh if it so transfers this agreement. 'The Company shall also have the right to form one or more subsidiary comnercial companies under its own contro 1 for the working of this agreement, which shall enjoy the rights and privileges and assume the engagements herein expressed. Alternatively, we might specifically provide in the first sub-paragraph for transfer to trie I.P.C., if that was what the Company wanted to cover, leaving the second sub paragraph as redrafted above. Mr. Fraser did not consider that the second alternative would be acceptable to the Company. In the first place, the I .P.C. might never want this concession and/10, and it was quite conceivable that it might he taken up tn? the i.P.O.O. and the Shell only. But he thought that the I.P»C. would see objection to the proposed redraft of sub -paragraph 1 and he was quite clear that there would be very serious difficulty as regards the proposed nro vision in the case of sub-paragraph 2. Save on the Jl question of British control he saw, however, no objection to making an37 assignment subject to the conditions of the agreement as it now stood. He was opposed, however, to giving the Sheikh any voice in approving the assignment. As he had made clear elsewhere, the Sheikh would use any right, however unsubstantial, given him under the agreement, to extort larger sums of money. As regards the composition of any assignee company, Mr. Praser and Mr* Hearn said that their difficulties, if they endeavoured to force a British assignee company upon the Board of the I.P.O., would be very great indeed. /Mr. Fraser left at this stage7 Mr. Hearn pointed out that Mr. Fraser had been entrusted with the negotiations in respect of this concession by the I.P.O., whom he must be regarded as representing. The I.P.O. was an international concern and it was most important not to give its Board any feeling that through allowing negotiations to be handled by the A.P.O.O. they had sacrificed their interests. One point of particular importance in this connection was that if a Company was registered in G-reat Britain, with its headquarters in this country, it would become liable to U.K. taxation. It was unreasonable to expect the foreign element in the I f P.C. to submit to U.K. taxation on/5'&gt; 11. on the Gompany ? ^ turnover. Mr. Laithv/aite enquired whether it would be possible to meet this point b3^ providing that a subsidiary Company might be registered, for example, in Canada, emphasising, however, that he did so purely as a suggestion and without any authority. Mr. Hearn, however, apparently thought that the same difficulties as regard? British exploitation and control would still have to be faced with the I»P#G., if an attempt were made to impose conditions on these points. After considerable further discussion it proved impossible to reach any agreement on this point. Mr. V|... I 11 »| I. -.luiniiiimw,,—......imnnNii.i. .hi.— Hearn was not prepared to go beyond the following redraft of Article 12, which might, he thought 7/ithout committing himself, be acceptable to the I.P.C # ' AETIOLE 1 2, The Company shall have the right to transfer this agreement to any other British commercial company, but not to any government, subject to such Company being able to fulfil all the autios and obligations of this agreement. The Company shall inform the Sheikh if it so transfers this agreement, ouch other commercial company shall be and remain a British company, registered in Great Britain, having its principal place of business in Great Britain, and the Chairman shall at all times be a British subject/ 1 'The Company shall be at liberty to form one or more subsidiary companies under its own control should it consider this to be necessary for the working of this concession. Any such subsidiary company shall, so far as they are applicable to its operations, enjoy all the rights/12. rights and privileges granted to the Company hereunder, and shall assume all the engagements and responsibilities herein expressed, except the engagement expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause J 1 Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that while paragraph 1 of the redraft accepted certain safeguards, the I.P*0,, under the terms of paragraph 2, would be completely free immediately on the transfer of the concession to them by the A»P.0*C. to form subsidiary companies to operate the concession which would be wholly foreign. The prospects of H.M.G. modifying their requirements were very small and if the redraft represented the best the Company could do it might be that the negotiations would break .down. Question of Ghief Local B^presentativc . Mr. Laithwaite aaid that the question of the Company r s representation in Qatar was one of some importance to 1 Ttiat arrangements did they contemplate? Mr. Hcarn said that probably at first there might be a Fields Manager, or possibly even a geologist: in either event a man of some little standing. Mr. Laithwaite said that here, as in Bahrein, H.M.G. would probably regard it as of great importance that the C.L.?, of the Company (particularly so long as there Y/as no Political Agent in Qatar) should be a British subject, grata, to H.M.G. and appointed with their approval. Mr. Hcarn said that he thought that the prospect of persuading the Board of the I.P.C. to agree to this might be greater if H.M.G. were to express it as a wish rather than as a demand. The point was not further discussed, AETICLE 13/13. misiR X3. T}!^ Goinpany agreed to consider the insertion in sub-paragraph (ii) of a provision that 'producing wells or borings at the time of such termination shall be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working', and to make a corresponding amendment in sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) in substitution for the words 'in such working condition as the property then is'. Thiv: would have to be discussed with the Shell Company who were co-operating with the A.P.O.G. in this matter. A5TIGLS 15 . (a) The Company stated that the Sheikh had been anxious to restrict force majeure to conditions in Qptar. The Company v/ere quite unable to agree to any such restriction and had made it clear that the clause must be in quite general terms. (b) Mr. Laithwaite suggested that the words 'the period of such delay, together with any such period as may be necessary for the restoration of' might be amended to read ''the period of such delay together with such period as may be reasonably necessary, subject to the approval (or in the view) of the Political Bebident, for the restoration, etc.' The Company saw no objection, but pointed out that it was the Sheikh who was anxious to keep the Political Resident out. Mr. Laithwaite said that H.IvUG. attached importance to providing that the Political Resident should/14. should be the person responsible for nominating the third arbitrator. The Coinpany said that they were perfectly willing to accept the Political Evident. The Court of International Justice had been substituted in deference to the Cheikh, who had indicated that he saw objection to bringing in the Political Resident and wished for some other authority. The Company had thereupon originally suggested the President of the Court of International Justice, to which the Shoikh had replied that he might be an Englishman, and in these circumstances the Court had been substituted, I g was agreed that there was no need for Mr. Chisholm to raise this point with the Sheikh at the present time. AHTIQLE 17 . The attention of the Company was drawn to the fact that this article as it stood raised several very important questions. 60 Jurir.dicti cm. This had been referred to in the discussion at the India Office on 11th jjecember. The Company stated that they would welcome the exercise of jurisdiction by H JUG. and had already made it clear that they were not prepared to agree- to the ^lieikh^s request that he should exercise jurisdiction in disputes between their employees and his subjects. (b) The Company agreed in the second sentence of the article to add the word '^uitable' in front of the word 'labourers 41 in line 5 and to delete the words demand unreasonable wages'. (c)/( g ) Mr. laithwaitc drew attention to the fact that here, as in connection with articles' 2 and 7, serious risks of political difficulty were involved. The introduction of labourers from outside might well cause considerable local difficulties. Thip was a point which H.M.G., on whom would fall the burden of dealing with a serious local situation, if one arose, must consider in deciding the terms subject to which they were prepared to approve the concession. He added lhat the terms of the article as it stood left the question of the nationality of non-Asiatic employees open. Would it be possible to have an understanding, if not a positive guarantee, that employees would in fact be British? The difficulties in connection with any employment of foreign employees were real, Mr. Hearn pointed out the difficulties to be anticipated in securing agreement on the part of the I,P.0.,to any such understanding. Ihey could do no more than put it to the Board. They would be quite willing to do this if we asked them to do so. The fact that the -American interests in Bahrein had agreed to a special provision might possibly ease matters, and he agreed that a reference to that fact and to the special treaty relations of might be made in any communication which we sent on the subject to the Ounpany. AmoTE 2n . The Company intimated that they intended to stand out for an Arabic and an English text. o The/16. The following general points wore put to the Company. (a) The possibility of the revision of the concession after a certain perioa. As drafted it ran for 75 years - a very long perioa: longer than either that of their concession in Persia or of the ^aerican concession in Bahrein. It might be to their interests as well as to those of the Sheikh to have some provision for revision at an earlier date. The Company said they were strongly averse from agreeing to any such provision. It would merely put them in the hands of the Sheikh. They would much prefer to leave matters as they were. It would be a considerable time before they knew where they stood in respect of oil in Qatar, (b) It was made clear to the representatives of the Company that while HJUG., subject to their being satisfied that the interests of the oheikh were secured and that their own special interests ano. responsibilities were also adequately safeguarded, might now be prepared to approve certain terms in a concession put forward by the A*P.0.C. in the interests of assisting the A.P.O.C. to secure the concession, they were not to be taken as in any way tying their hands as regards the future. If the A.P.0*0. failed now to secure the concession from the Sheikh on such terms as might approve and if subsequently other parties, e.g. the standard Oil, came into the field, H.M.Gr. must regard their hands as entirely free, and the terms of any concession would have to form the subject of further discussion. The Company said that thuy appreciated the position. , \ /17, fc) Considerable emphasis was laid at earlier stages in the discussion on the special responsibilities of H.M.Gr. and the fact that the unsettled and uncivilised nature of Qatar and the fact that it was neither an island, like Bahrein, which could easily be controlled from the sea, nor in a more or less advanced state of civilisation, like Persia or Iraq, made it necessary for H.M.Gr- to watch all developments very closely and to take special precautions which might not otherwise be nocessary or appropriate, and for the Company on its side to exercise extreme caution in taking advantage of certain of the rights given them under concessions and in their dealings with the local authorities and population. The representatives of the Company appeared to understand the position, and it was agreed, in connection with articles 2, 6, and 17 (see record) that their specific attention should be dram to these facts. Mr. Heam said that he thought it would be possible to inform Mr. Ghisholm by telegraph of the more important amendments which had been agreed at the meeting. As it was clear that the question of Article 12 was still entirely open and would necessitate further consideration and discussion, Mr. Chisholm would be instructed to avoid committing himself in any way regarding it.

A copy of a revised draft concession which they have recently coiimmicated to us informally is enclosed. As you will see, the draft contains no provision to safeguard our position in respect of aerodromes, present or future, in Qatar. We are, of course, in the difficulty that at the mornent we have no regular aerodrome, but merely the emergency landing ground which has been marked, out with bags of chalk consequent on the Sheikh's refusal to give us the facilities we want- But company' s as the/concession, if they succeed in getting it, will toiwiander w.A.

Ihe Company were very reluctant to agree to this, but ultimately indicated their readiness to consider dealing with the point in an exchange of letters. 4. The draft agreement raises various important questions of policy and will necessitate further examination of the general safeguards which it might be thought desirable to ask the Company to agree to (either in the concession itself or in a subsidiary agreement or exchange of letters between H.M.G. and the Company) as a condition of our consent to their proposals. We should tie very grateful in these circumstances if you could let us/0&gt; - 3 - us know as soon as possible, even in the most general terms, what your views are as regards future air requirements. If, 'oy any chance, consequent on the grant of an oil concession to the A.P&lt;O.G. (or any other competitor) we had to reach a general agreement with the Staeikh on questions such as jurisdiction and the maintenanos of a political representative in Qitar it might well te that the opportunity would be a convenient one to dispose of the question of air facilities. 5.

Arising out of the endeavours of the Anglo- persian Oil Company to secure a concession in Qatar, we have been considering tentatively the various political questions which would arise in the event of either the A.P.O.C. or any other company obtaining a concession in that state. We shall probably have to consult you (and Fowle) in the near future on the question generally and it Is thought that the note which I enclose of an informal discussion on the lath December with Hendel may be of some assistance in this connection. It will, of course, be appreciated that neither Bendel nor I in the conversation in question were able to commit our respective departments, and that, as stated in paragraph 8 of the record, 'the whole question of policy will, of course, have to be considered on the widest grounds ana the points at issue would have to be submitted to higher authority.

J.G. LAITHWAITEP. z. nONFTDENTlAL , TKTIIA OFFICE . P.Z. /33. Note of conversation on 15th December 1933, with Mr. G.W. Rendel, Foreign Office, on future policy in regard to Qatar. The question of future policy in rega rd to Qatar, bo'STgenerally and with particular reference to the questions raised by any oil concession that might be granted there, was discussed iniorn&amp;lly with Mr .Hendel on the 15th December. 2. On the question of general policy I recalled tnat tne position was that ^atar had an area of rather over 3,000 square miles and a population of some 26,000 (1917). our relations with it were governed by a Treaty (on the general line of the Trucial Treaties) made with the pie sent bheikh by Sir Percy Cox in 1916. We had agreed at the time that three articles of that Treaty, viz., articles 7 (admission of British subjects to Qatar for trade); 8 (admission of an agent on behalf of H.M.G.); and 9 (establishment of post and telegraph offices in Qatar), snoula not come into operation for the present. We had also given the Sheikh an undertaking In general terms to grant him good off ice s 'siiould I or my subjects be assailed b2_land within the territories of .Qatar.' (.irticle ii). j n i92i, the sheikh had represented that he alarrnacj lest some of his townspeople should become an and go over to Ibn Saud and had asked whether H.M.G. would assist him should he he attacked from the interior. He had been informed in reply that H.M.G. were not/h ® 2. not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance should he be attacked t»y Ihn Saud. Nothing of much consequence as tearing on general relations with H.M.G. had occurred in Qatar between then and 1932, when, aiter unsuccessful negotiations with the Sheikh for aerodrome facilities, which had broken down because of our refusal to give him the formal guarantee of protection in all circumstances which he was anxious to secure, we had narked out a landing ground by dropping bags of chalk from the air near Dohah and had warned him that if aircraft using it were molested he would be called to account^ but that if he treated them well he would be rewarded. In the same year the A.P.O.G. had, with our knowledge and permission, entered into direct negotiations with the Sheikh for the purpose of securing an oil concession which, however, if obtained, would have to be transferred to the Iraq Petroleum Company, in accordance with the Group Agreement between that Company and the A.P.O.C. Negotiations were still proceeding, but the Sheikh had adopted an evasive attitude towards the British political authorities in the Gulf in respect of them. Ihe latest information from the Company was to the effect that he had been anxious to secure their (k) jconcurrence in the exercise 'by him of jurisdiction in any disputes which might arise 'between his subjects and their (_ I-1 _ employees'; that he had asked them to undertake to supply him with arms for tne defence of their works (a request which strictly speaking was hardly consistent with Article 3 of iiis Treaty of 1916); and that he had indicated, in connection wioh tne arbitration provisions to he included in the concession under negotiation, that he was apprehensive of the Political Resident; was anxious that some international 'body such as the. Permanent Court of International justice at The Hdgu^ should be referred to, hut disliked the suggestion that the/3. the president of the Court should be specifically nominated, on the ground that he might he an Englishman. 3. Theie seerued now some possibility that the £'• A.P.O.C. might secure the concession from the Sheikh who appetired to be actively interested anci it was probably, therefore, of immediate importance to consider what steps we should take to tighten up our general political relations with Qatar. The most important points we re i -rtr ;5 jurisdiction, and the bringing into force of the dormant articles of the Sheikh's Treaty. If, however, we were going to raise these major questions we might as well take the opportunity to secure the Air Ministry desiderata in regard to aerodromes, etc., from the Sheikh, it was, of course, clear tnat no action could be taken until we had consulted and had the recommendations of the Government of India and the Political Resident, who are both closely concerned with the question. Pv lL 4 ' 0n ^ Question of jurisdiction it would be desirable to aim at antgreement on the lines of those in lores in Koweit and Bahrein, the effect of which would be to transfer jurisdiction over foreigners in the State to | difficulty might be anticipated in persuading the sheikh, who was an obstinate ana suspicious old nan ■ th a rather narrow outlooK, to agree to any such surrender rights, out, particularly if there was to be any ^sk of an influx of foreign employees, the point was one 01 real substance. I ^ fhe appointment of a political Officer in Qatar t) Q O'P , 4-V-i /'i -v, '1 . r urgency, it seemed unlikely to be on inviting place for a European. No European, except for Casual travellers, had entered it; it had no large town; (the/© I 4. (the population of Dohah in 1917 was about 12,000); its population was 'backward and appeared to 'bo to a large extent noniadic Bedouin; and the ordinary resources of civilisation which were to be found in varying degrees in Kowe.it, Bahrein and toscaljjwere entirely lacking. On the other hand, if there was to he a serious oil development in the country, accompanied by the erection of elaborate buildings, refineries, etc#, and possibly by the introauctlon of individuals of various nationalities, it would probably be essential to have a Political Officer on the spot to exercise jurisdiction, and, once the concession haa been negotiated, to serve (a.s in buhrein) as the cnannel of correspondence between tlie Company and the Sheikh. Clearly, however, large questions of policy were involved, and it was conceivable that it might be necessary in the long rum to bring lorcible pressure to bear on the Sheikh to secure our dcdijorctta. If it came to that, it was not irrelevant that Qatar, vciich was a rectangle of which the two long siaes and one short side were bounded by the sea, was in some ways almost as open to forcible pressure as an island such as Bahrein, although nothing could of course De done in the desert hinterland.. So much for the general political position. The noxt Question to consider was the problems which ffiight arise m connection with the grant of an oil C oncossion to the A.P.O^C, or any other Company. The xor^ign Office had always made it clear that they were ^xious to walk very carefully in this part of the world, -o to -void an oil war with American oil interests what was on a long view a relatively unimportant area, emphasised in connection with both Koweit and Bahrein/5. 7/ Bahrein their anxiety to work on the basis of an open door policy so far as possible. On the other hand the India Office and Admiralty, while appreciating the Foreign Office point of view, had been anxious to ao their utmost to secure tnat foi locctl poliuiCcil reasons, and in view of our special treaty relations and responsibilities, any development in these areas should be so far as possible under British control. In the case of Bahrein a compromise had finally been reached which seemed at the moment to be working satisfactorily, but wnich was not in itself ideal, under which the American interests concerned had given certain guarantees as regards the employment of British personnel etc. The position inJKoweit was at the moment quite open and would have to be considered further in the near future. In the case of Qatar it had always been accepted tnat the AiP#6#C», if they secured their concession, would have to transfer it to the I.P.O., which was an international body containing only a relatively Siiidl 1 .british e 1 oment, but no c ommitment had be en entered into as regards the conditions in respect of British representation and control which H.M.G. (whose consent was necessary to the'grant b^ the Sheikh of any concession) would attach to their consent, ihe representatives of the A.P.Q.c. in the rnee'ting which had taken place at the India Oifice on 14th December, of which a record wasjoeing circulated, ha a been quite Hnoompro^ thoar rofua&amp;l u o tint ' er ^o any permanent commitment as regards the British character of the exploitation of any concession gxanted (although they had responded well to a suggestion that certain connected safeguards might be covered in exchanges of letters between H.Ivi.G. and the Company) and the point by agreement had been left over for further consideration.7- 6. T- We had now admitted American Interests to develop tne ^c^iireln concession anu tne door was open to them in Koweit. on the Trucial Coast our present policy w&amp;b to ezclude all O j.1 concession hunters^ whether Bxitish or foreign, on the ground of tne backward character of the area and the risks involved. No interest had been shown for many years by any company in oil in I.iuscat, i/ith riasa we were not ourselves concerned. No suggestion could in these circumstances be made that we had refused to agree to an 'open door' policy In the Gulf where oil was concerned when circumstances were such as to make this possible or had discriminated ^ j against tne U.S.A. But the position in Qatar was quite l^ peculia r. As already remarked, it was an uncivilised dM undeveloped Arab sheikhdom, the boundaries of which were undefined; and which non-Asiatic foreigners could i at present enter only with the Hesident's permission; with an unadministered hinterland and a scattered | population, possibilities of aifficulty with which in i cVSr:i '' : ' of their contact with foreign labourers or non-ivsiatic subordinate personnel of the wrong type might I Ml be consiaerable. If any such trouble arose H.M.G. F have to deal with it themselves or allow it I 'O dealt with by the foreign powers whose nationals affected. To allow foreign powers to deal with it fionu,ox course, be contrary to our general principles ; na this part of the world, ana the Sheikh was, for that ' ' P re eluded oy his treaty engagements from having dealings with foreign powers or receiving their -preventatives. Assuming, however, that the responsJbillly for/•-i -i 7. for handling ohe situation devolved upon us, it was evident that we were faced with a far more difficult problem in Qatar than elsewhere. Bahrein was an island and easily subject to pressure from the sea. Pressure, at any rate on the sea front and on the capital could also he brought to bear in Kowelt, though the situation there had many points of resemblance to Qatar, and special safeguards on similar lines might have to be considered. Iraq and Persia,were both more or less civilised countries with a central authority, with a regular system of government ana without an unadministered hinterland. But the responsibilities in which we might be involved in the case of Q a tar, running as it aid back into the desert, with its absence of regular supplies, etc., might be ' very serious indeed. Having regard to this (assuming that we could not, as on the Truclal coast, prohibit any oil development) was it quite impossible for us to adopt the same line in the matter of oil in Qatar as we had along the whole Arab littoral in connection with air procedure? There, with the concurrence of the foreign Office and the other interested Departments, '^naa ^aaopted a facade policy , which we proposed, if and when the time came, to apply to Qatar also, securing lor ourselves complete control of air facilities, civil illtary, behind the facade of the Sheikh, and ueclinmg to allow foreigners to use the Arab air route, ^ve on a line laid down by us, or to visit certain areas/8. areas of the Arab coast, on the grounci that the political conditions there were such that we were not prepared to face the risks involved, responsibility for dealing with which rested with us under our special treaty relations with the rulers concerned. A type of solution which had occurred to me personally as possible was that we should lay it down as a general rule, to apply to any oil company, whether British or Anierlcan, which might succeed in obtaining a concession in Qatar, that, for the political reasons which I had just explained, the exploitation of the concession and the local representations of the concessionnaire must be wholly in British hands (no doubt a compromise could be arranged as regards one or two highly expert individuals if it proved iiupossrole to fill their places from British sources). No question of discrimination against American interests would arise ana our Justification if we were challenged through the diplomatic channel would oe that we had dealt with the case on merits; that the Political conditions of Qatar were quite special; that while we were prepared to face certain risks in respect ol our own nationals we were not prepared to face them in respect of those of otoer countries; that we equally intended to hold the Sheikhs to their special treaty okli 0 atlons to us in the matter of dealing with foreign countries, and that while we did not propose necessarily to stipulate that any company, which, or a outsiaiary of which, was operating in Qatar, should itself be under complete British control, we could not gr^e to exploitation or local representation save fay P r so anel of British nationality and subject to certain specific/7&gt;' 9. specific understanding, e.g. that the Company would in its dealings with the Sheikh or the local inhabitants be guided by our advice. (The terms of any reply would, of course, turn on whether or not H.M.G. had intimated their readiness to agree to an American or other non-Sritish company obtaining and operating an oil concession and on the terms of any such agreement. 8. Mr.Rendel said that he appreciated the force o^ X 1 1 — — the above arguments, and that while the whole question of policy would, of course, have to be considered on the widest grounds and the points at issue would have to be submitted to higher authorities, his personal first * hk -fw«mnnrirr J t. l inm J in.i - -n u impression was that it should be possible to make a strong ca^e for insisting, as regards Qatar, on conditions regarding .oritish exploitation and local management on the lines suggested. All this would, however, take time, and meanwhile it seemed to him extremely important that nothing should be done to delay the conclusion of an agreement between the A.P.O.C. and the Sheikh, since any such delay might well result in a purely American interest (e.g.the Standard Oil of California which already holds the Hasa Coast concession) coming in as a serious ccmpetitor, and possibly acquiring the concession; in which case H.M.G. would be in a far more difficult position than if they had to deal with the A.P.O.C. or even the I.P.C. 9. Mr.Rendel explained that in his view there were i ypes of questions involved, i.e. those between the cmpany and the Sheikh, which would have to be dealt with he concession now under negotiation, and those between the C0mpany a ' nd H.M.G. , which might involve difficult questions/10. questions of policy. The question of the safeguards to be inserted in any oil agreement to preserve the British character of the operating company on the lines suggested above seemed to him to fall within the second category. 10. He therefore suggested that it should be made clear to the Company at once that we should eventually, ' ' , in view of the peculiar political situation on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, have to insist on certain safeguards before we could agree to any.concession coming into force. These safeguards would be of general application and would apply equally in the case of any concession which the Sheikh might grant. H.M.G. did not wish, however, to delay the conclusion of an agreement between the Company and the Sheilch by holding matters up pending the discussion of the details of these safeguards at this stage. They would therefore suggest that the concession should contain a clause providing that it should not come into force until H.M.G. had given their written consent thereto. This would be in accordance with the Sheikh's treaty obligations towards us. Our eventual consent would then be dependent on our reaching a separate agreement with the Company, which might be embodied in an exchange of letters and which would contain particulars of any safeguards it was eventually decided to insist upon. 11. This would limit the immediate discussion to outstanding points in which H.M.G. had a direct interest between the Company and the Sheikh, such as the question of jurisdiction etc. , but would avoid any risk of the concession being lost or delayed while arguments wer^ proceeding/11. proceeding on matters which did not strictly speaking affect the Sheikh and would in any case be of equal application whatever company was seeking to obtain a c oncessi on. 12. Meanwhile, if we could give the Company any indication of the nature of the safeguards, etc., which we should have to insist upon it would be all to the good. 13. It was agreed that a note of the conversation should be prepared to serve as a basis for further considerati on. J. G. LAITHWAJTE. 1 ^ DEC 1933CONFIDENTIAL.

PATED 6th January% 1934, My dear Fowle, Ghisholm has now reported to me the results of his conversations with you in Bushire on the Qatar situation. I hope that the details which he was able to give you were useful, and I am most grateful to you for your advice and assistance. If I haa realised how long the irail steamer was stopping in Mohammerah on Thursday I would have taken the opportunity of meeting you myself, but as it was, and as there was then no fresh news from my London principals I did not come over from Abadan. Actually I received their telegram later in the same morning. They are not prepared to accept the Shaikh's aemana for Rs.500, X-O/- annually plus royalty after four years. Eri + u 111 v: ^ ew 01 Kamazan at this end ana discussions pending with H.M.G. at that end, they consider that local negotiations are Dest^ept suspended for the moment. This seems to fit in y ^ lth your view ? as expressed to Chisholm, that any action in atar should not be until after Ramazan. np . . .. As regards their discussions with H .M .G., my London state that progress is being made in agreeing and i necess aiy amendments to our proposals. They also trp nn ' t ' he su 5§ e stion of H.M.G., they are considering y of mak:in S a main agreement v/ith the Shaikh, aRrepnpn+ PU ^+J y T T C 1 0irjnierCial an ^ a lso a supplementary this H#M#G * Possibly you are already au fait with mentioned above! 0 WhlCh 1 kn0W aS yet n0 m0re than 1 have It seems to me that now that we know (a) that we are not going to accept the Shaikh's 'October demards 1 (^) that H.M.G's discussions with us in London have reached such an interesting condition t would be extremely valuable for London to receive yourf/ views on the situation as you inaicated them to Chisholm; namely that, by virtue of the I.P.C. group agreement, H.M.G. would not be shutting the atar door to America if they pressed the Shaikh to accept our offer; and that the full protection agreement which the Shaikh requires from H.M.G. would be a suitable quid pro quo for his accepting H.M.G*s advice. I venture to believe that a telegram'from you on those lines would be an invaluable contribution at this juncture to the discussions proceeding in London. Your letter D.O. No.1959 - S of 22nd December, for which many thanks, contains information which we have also now received from certain sources. The Shaikh did hint during the negotiations that he would be involved in difficulties and expense in protecting a concessionaire Company operating in the hinterland of Catar, but as Chisholm was then unaware that his agreement with H.M.G. does not embody full protection, the hint was wasted. As regards the Kuwait situation, I have no further news to report. v! . . I am having this letter delivered to you by Haji Williamson. Perhaps you will be good enough to let me know through him your movements on leaving Kuwait, as I am anxious to be able to keep touch in case further developments occur before you return to Bushire. Yours sincerely, Lieut. Col. T.C .v;. Fowle, C.B.S., Political Resident &amp; Consul General, Bushire. - l^OOAlT,Note on tiae possibility of obtaining a suitable settlement ot of the Qatar Oil Question by a promise of protection to the Euler of Qatar. \r I 13 The position appears to be:- (a) that His Ma3estj t s Government attach great importance to ensuring British control over any oil field in Qatar,even ii wholly British ownership proves to be impossible to secure; (b) that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited are making a strong efiort to secure the concession,but (c) that Shaiida 'Abdullah bin ^asim al Than! does not propose to give the concession to the Ajaglo-Persian Oil Oompany Limited (except on nis own terms whicn the Company consider exorbitant),unless ana until ne has had a chance of seeing what American interests will offer,and (d) that owing to the complicated situation in the Oil World the value of our Treaty position Has been sorely diminished. 2. It is not known (to me) to what extent success iias attended the explorations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited,but presumably a considerable measure of success or they would hardly have gone as far as they have to meet the Shaikh's demands. 3. It is probable that the American interests may accept the Shaikh's terms,or at any rate offer specially good.even uneconomic,terms in order to round off their area in this part of the world. Ife must/therefore, face a strong possibility, if not probability,of American interests securing the Qatar Concession. It IS true that our Treaty position is very useful,but if the /American2. American offer is definitely advantageous to tiie Shaikh,it will be almost impossible in practice (especially having regard to the attitude of the United States Groverronent in oil matters) to stand on our Treaty rights to keep them out: and it is doubtful to what extent we shall he able to use our Treaty rights to ensure getting our other desiderata- 5. If American interests ggt the ^atar Oil Concession, they will have one continuous block of territory from, if not including,Kuwait to the Trucial Coast. If trouble arises, either we shall have to rescue and protect them,or we shall have to face the likelihood oi American forces doing so and establishing themselves in the Gulf, Incidentally we shall find it difficult in practice to keep them permanently away from the Trucial Coast should they become interested in it. 6# If American interests do not get the Qatar Concession, it seems likely that every effort will be made to reduce the territory covered by the Qatar Concession,by means of claiming the southern area for Bin Sa f ud# In that case we must face H eitner protecting Shaikh 'Abdullah bin ^asim al Thani and having ! serious trouble with Bin Sa^d and the American interests (and their Government),or giving in to their claims in which case we shall not only lose our concession area but also suffer a, possibly final,blow to our influence in the Gulf. t• II the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited get the concession,it would place us in a better position than if a purely American concern were to get the concession,but even then may oe difficult to ensure that the area is developed by a British concern,and to ensure getting our other desiderata. Events are moving rapidly and it seems impossible to oid,whether we wish it or not,being drawn both into interference! /(whether3. (whether open or veiled) in Qatar,and also into responsibility for the defence of life and property,both there and elsewhere along the Arab Littoral. The possibility of having a political Agent in Qatar has,indeed,been foreshadowed by His ilajesty's Grovernment and such an appointment would commit us deeply. It seems hardly too much to say that the time has come when either (i) we must face and accept responsibility,or (ii) we must be prepared to watch the United States of America assume it. 9. I believe that it would be possible to defend Qatar by air action taken from Bahrain,as the furthermost point at which delensiE action would be necessary is within a radius of 140 miles from Muharraq. and there are not very many wells in the southern area of the Peninsula. Moreover,if we have a formal agreement to protect this area,it is unlikely that either Bin Sa'ud or the American interests would dare to attack,or to instigate an attack,on it. 10. I would,therefore,suggest that we consider offering Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani protection of all his territory ^at any rate up to the Salwa-Anbak-Dhuwaihin line) provided that he gives the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited,that he undertakes that he will not allow it to be assigned to any Company who will not accept such safe guards as we require; and that he allows us to establish in Qatar an emergency landing ground with a fuel tank. 11. our position would then be a strong one and we should not in reality nave assumed any greater measure of responsibility ^ is likely,in any case,to be forced upon us by circumstances. ^ loth 19 34.

Details of general terms are for the present therefore of secondary importance, 3^ Situation is serious. There is no douht whatever that Bin Saud partly from pecuniary motives hut also in pursuance of his general policy of trying to ahsorh the Arah Shaikhdoms (vide for instance his intentions towards Kuwait discussed at an Interdepartmental Meeting on 5th October last) is 'behind Standard Oil Company of Oalifornia # s attempt to penetrate Qatar. \ 4. Shaikh of Qatar is more a large merchant than a Ruler and has practically no authority^over the interior of his State where oil pporations will presumably he carxied on, and where the strongest Bedouin elements are migratory tribes from/from Saudi Arabia. Should the Standard Oil get the concession' therefore it is prohahly Bin Saud who will protect them and who will thus gain a definite footing in Qatar. Further the Standard Oil Company may invoke protection prohahly naval from their own government. 5., Only way for His Majesty's G-overnment to repel this combined American oil interest - Bin Saud offensive is to take their stand on Article Y of Qatar 1916 Treaty and inform Shaikh that they will not permit him to grant concession to any Oompany which is not at least % partly British# Yis-a-vis Americans this would not 'be shutting of •op^n door* as American groups form part of Iraq.

Qatar situation in fact raises various serious problems for decision. Fortunately however there is no immediate hurry# nothing can he done with Shaikh until after ?.ainazan (20th instant) and Company's present option does not expire until August next. - EESIDEHC -CONFIDENTIAL.

It is politically most desirable, both because of international character of ^ Iraq.

(After compliments.) I Whereas your Honour has to-day entered into and signed with me, on behalf of the- British Government, an agreement or treaty, with the object of cementing the relations between the High British Government and yourself, and whereas your' Honour has expressed the opinion that the time has not yet come for giving effect to articles (7), (8), and (9), which relate to :— (1) The admission of British subjects to Qatar for trade.

We are in general agreement with Resident and consider it most important that Shaikh should be dissuaded or prevented from granting concession to Stand- -ard Oil Company this are stated in para- , /j , '&lt;5 ^ graphs 3 and 4 of Fowled telegram No.T/19 with which we concur and it is obvious that development, probably involving absorbtion of Qatar by 1 Ibn Saud, would serious- -ly undermine British political position in the Gulf [A'VPJ , administration'^ His Majesty^ Governments interest in general oil. 3. Most direct line to take would be to do as Fowle suggests and tell the Shaikh that His esty s Government's consent will be withheld unless concession is granted partly to British Company, Vthough we realise that such an attitude might be difficult to justify to American Government....2. American Government, particularly if better financial terras were offered to Shaikh bx e.g. standard Oil Company than Anglo-Persian Oil Company and 1 Iraq Petrol- -eura Company are prepared to give. We therefore suggest alternative line of approach which might per- -guade Shaikh to do as we wish. 4. Resident should he authorised to offer Shaikh the full protect ion,similar to Bahrain and Kuwait, which he asked for and was refused in connection with w : s emergency landing ground at Qatar. The previous decisiort is, we consider, justified by the far greater importance of interests now involved and also by the fact that His Majesty's Government will in practice be responsible for providing such protection if oil company is working in t^atar with their consent. We also understand that practical ' ^ affording protection by use of aircraft would be comparatively small. This guarantee of protection would ostensibly be given as cuid oro nuo for surrender of jurisdiction over foreign subjects which should, ?/e consider, be made an indispen- -sable pre-condition under Article V of Treaty. There seems to us to be no advantage in trying to treat question of jurisdiction on general lines and as unconnected with oil concession since Shaikh is too cunning to be deceived and wil^probably otnly give a definite answer within a reasonable period if he is made to realise that his finances will be affected by delay. It does not seem necessary at present to insist on bringing Articles of Treaty into force as Articli VIII is the only one of importance.•..3 importance and this can be arranged later if ? protect ion is granted. If he accepts these terms and still attempts to give concession to Standard Oil Company, it may be necessary to adopt a still firmer line and threatelfaehim with deposition but it may be a that prospect of closer relations with His Majesty 1 s Government may make him more amenable to their unexpressed wishes of which he is no doubt well;8aware. 5. As regards procedure, we agree with Resident that he should deal with Shaikh by personal discussions and that procedure suggested by Resident should be adopted after main question as to who is to obtain concession has been settled.

Having regard to all the circumstances I am of opinion that next stej should he for me to pay a visit to the Shaikh which would he in the nature of a preliminary reconnaissance. 2. 1 suggest that in the GQurse of frank, ana friendly conversations with the Shaikh I should point out to him: la) our natural desire that the concession should go to the Anglo Persian Oil Company (Is) that present terms offered hy the latter are generous. (c) that it is no secret that Bin Saud is 'behind California Oil Company and that result of latter obtaining concession will he absorption of his territory hy Bin Saud and his disappearance as an independent 1 ruler. 1^ Shaikh attaches value to our protection he will presumably ask for it or throw out feelers and his attitude on this important paint will he cleared up*-2- 4. Should Shaikh ask for our protection, in order to enhance its value, I will assume suitable hesitation ana reply that matter must he referred to His MaJesty 1 s Government. 5. Before however I approach Shaikh I venture to suggest that His Majesty's Government should for the moment put all other considerations aside and (1) decide whether if Shaikh gives Anglo Persian Oil Company concession we can promise him full protection. 12) endeavour to extract from A.P.O.C. - I.P.O. p IM _ pjtj the Agreement suggested in my telegrams Nos.69 and 70. In order to avoid complicating issue only two most important stipulations might he demanded (a) that all local exploiting personnel should he British, (h) conditions of transfer of Agreement (Article 12) to he agreeable to His Majesty's G-overnment. 6. A firm line in my opinion should now he taken with the Anglo Persian Oil Company - Iraq. Petroleum Company and they should he informed plainly that having 'been given a perfectly free hand in Qatar and having hy reason of their failure forced His Majesty's Government to come to their assistance it is now His Majesty's Government who will call the tune. - RESIDENT -</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000259_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/627</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000259</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/627</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'F 83 File 82/27-II QATAR OIL'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1934</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-05-09T00:06:52</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (310 folios)</extent><extent>The documents in the volume are mostly arranged in chronological order.
