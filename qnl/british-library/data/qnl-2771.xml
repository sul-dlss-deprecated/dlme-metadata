Stannus had not attempted to prevent the commander of the Imam's fleet from carrying out his orders, but had warned him not to commit any acts of aggression, or to interfere in trade. Stannus had pointed out to the commander that the simple appearance of the fleet should be enough to ensure that the Imam's claims received proper attention without exciting discontent among the Arab tribes.The letter is accompanied by the following enclosures:a marginal note refers to page 249 of the same volume for a copy of a letter from Stannus to Captain Robert Taylor [IOR/R/15/1/36, ff 124-125];letter from Stannus to the Imam of Muscat, undated, stating that he had asked the commander of the Imam's squadron at Bussorah to avoid taking any offensive action until he had received further instructions from the Imam and not to interfere with the trade or people of Bussorah. He also points out the danger of the Imam's becoming embroiled with the Turkish Government and exciting discontent throughout the Gulf;extract of a letter from Stannus to Mohamed ben Sooliman, Commander of the Imam's Fleet, dated 29 July 1826, strongly advising him not to engage any hostile acts at Bussorah until the results were known of Captain Robert Taylor's intervention with the Turkish authorities for the purpose of settling the claims of the Imam of Muscat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024055009.0x0000b5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
