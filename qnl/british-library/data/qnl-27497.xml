EsquireSir A* Bannerman, Sheiidi Mohammed Bin Isa al Khalifa, who is to attend the Garden Party tomorrow, is the younger son of the deposed iheikh of Bahrein (sheikh Sir Isa, K.C.I.r..) who was relieved of the Government for misrule in 1923 find who is still alive aged 84. He remains the titular sheikh of the Islands hut the Government is in the hands of his elder son Sheikh Hamad. Sheikh Mohammed who is a man of about 50 is now paying his first visit to England. He has been suffering from cataract and went to India in the hope of finding a cure. He was there recommended to try European doctors and went to Vienna and Paris, doing the Haj on the way. His visit to London is solely for the purpose of having the honour of being received by His Majesty. It will be remembered that the King received in 1919 certain Arab Kulers including the brother of Gheikh Mohammed. His i^ajesty may think fit to address a few words to the Sheikh. This would be greatly appreciated. He might also care to enquire about the health of Sheikh/sheikh Isa and Sheikh Hamad, sheikh Mohammed has no axe to grind and has spent his time while in i&amp;igland sight-seeing. He has been to Windsor, the Tower, the Aldershot Tattoo and the Air Force Pageant. He will be accompanied by Lieut.Colonel Loch whom you know. Colonel Loch is posted as Political Agent, Bahrein and will take up duty towards the end of the year. His last appointment was as President of the State Council in Rewa. The Sheikh leaves Lonaon for Bahrein immediately after the Garden Party on the morning of the 2Lnd. 2® 7' / n INDIA. OFFICB, WHITEHALL, 3.W.I. 6th July, 1932. Dear Loch, Many thanks for your letter of 3rd July. Shaikh Muhammad has written to me to-day to say that he proposes to go to France for ten days before the Garden Party (I gather he will be back by the 18th), and this I think would make it more difficult to fit in a Tisit to an air port. But in any case, as he has been to the Tattoo,and suitably impressed by the doings of the Air Force, and ns Biscoe in a private letter this week says thnt Shaikh Hamid, who knew nothing about Muhammad’s visit to ingland, is rather upset and thinks thnt the younger brother will have ’stripped the cupbonrd bare’ in case he, Hamid, ever thinks of coming to this country, I am rather inclined to suggest that we should leuve things as they are and not give him any extra facilities. I shall be delighted to see you any time that suits Oja. you on the morning of the 19th - the^file is rather difficult to follow, but I can give you full information about all recent developments. Burchall was at a meeting the/the other day about arranK®* .ents for improving the Bahrein wireless in connection with the air route* I am very glad your posting is at last confirmed. I will dig out some papers bearing on conditions in Bahrein which you might care to go through. It is now certain that Biscoe is coming home. He will be here in the early p^rt of August. ^ ^ Yours sincerely, ^ J. G.

Do you see any objection ? I suppose his ruling brothan would not thinic it taking too much notice of him - are they friends ? I wonder if I might come round on the morn ing of the 1^9th and read up the Air file - I saw the papers in Simla up to about January but know little of subsequent developments? Yours sincerely B.S.

I am afraid that I should not otherwise be in or near Town on the 21st July,but I fully agree with you that it would make a great difference to Shaikh Muhammad (and possibly help a bit in Bahrain) to have with him someone who knows him and his country , and I will, therefore,gladly come down to London to accompany him to the Royal Garden Pasty. I presume that his attendant (!) will not go with him ? I have not met him for many years,so I think that it would be wise for me to see something of him before the actual day # and I would suggest that I should come by the night train of the U:/leth July and taKe him out a bit on the 19th and 20th: can you tell me where he will be staying then? I presume that he will be in sober Arab attire , and has not adopted the Glengarry bonnet of ’Iraq or the Homburg of Turkey,with which I could not bear to be associated in public ! Yours sincerely.

I am ▼ery glad you enjoyed the Tattoo so much. His Majesty the King who has been informed of your arrival in England and of your desire to pay your respects to him has commanded that you should be invited to attend the Royal Garden Party at Buckingham Palace on the 21st July, and should there be presented to him. You will, in due course, receive a formal invitation fran the Lord Chamberlain to attend the Party. I fear that it has been impossible, owing to His Majesty's engagements, to arrange any earlier date, but you mentioned to me, I think, that you were proposing to go to Kdinburgh and other places in Kngland, and you may think it well, therefore, to pay these visits between now and the date of the Garden Party. The Secretary of State is looking forward to seeing you in the near future but,owing to pressure of Parliamentary business, is at the moment unable to suggest Shaikh Mohammad Bin Issa, 6, Queen's Gate, S.W.7. a/a date and time* I hope to let you know definitely about this in the course of the next couple of days.

London of Sheikh Mohamed Bin I aa« younger brother of the Shei ^Bahrein, Sheikh Mohamed called to see me this afternoon. He speaks practically no English and is accompanied by a Bahreini who acted as interpreter. He stated that he left Bahrein in February of this year for India (this is confimed by the Persian Gulf Diaries) to secure treatment for his eyes (he is suffering from cataract). Treatment in India had not been successful and he had been advised to try European doctors in Vienna or Paris. He had accordingly proceeded direct from India to Mecca for the Pilgrimage and had thence come to Europe. Doctors in Vienna and Paris had not been able to assist him, but finding himself in Paris he decided to come to London in order to pay his respects to the Secretary of State and, if possible, to have the honour of being received by His Majesty the King. The Hedjaz Minister was an old friend and in his ignorance of the country he had got in touch with him immediately on arrival and had, through him, been put in touch with the India Office. He has now taken a flat at 6, queen’s Gate, and proposes to remain in London for the present in the hope of being received by the Secretary of State and possibly by His Majesty. He attaches great importance to being so received in view of the fact that his brothers had had the honour of an audience on the occasion of their visit to England and feels that his face would be blackened if he returned to Bahrein without securing similar treatment. I said that the Secretary of State was very heavily/heavily engaged at the moment hut that I would convey to him the Sheikh’s desire to he received and had no douht that if arrangements could he made he would welcome the opportunity of making the Sheikh’s acquaintance. The Sheikh’s explanation of his visit seemed quite satisfactory, and if Colonel Biscoe, to whom we telegraphed for observations last night, sees no objection he might he granted an interview by the Secretary of State and possibly he presented to the King at a Garden Party. But until we receive the Political Resident’s reply there is nothing to he done. It may he added that the Sheikh referred to the fact that the Pea^rling Season had been particularly had and that there had been a great falling off in receipts. In these circumstances the news which he had recently had from Bahrein that the American Drillers had succeeded in tapping oil was particularly encouraging as it would ease the difficult financial position of the St at e .4-2, EATON PLACE, LONDON, S.W. 1 . Royn, Legation of Hedjaz&amp; Nejd, London. lOtft June, 1932 Dear Mr. Laithwaite, I must tnank you very much for yoir letter of the 9th, the contents of 'which, as I intimated, on the telephone this morning, I have already conveyed to Sheikh Mohamed and the Minister, and they are both very grateful to you for your kindness and help. The Minister hopes that he may have the pleasure of seeing you soon, and Sheikh Mohamed is looking for ward with great pleasure to meeting you this afternoon. Yours sincerely J.G. Laithwaite, Esq India Office, Whitehall.The '^nxsaesi of the Hejaz Legation rang me up this morning to say that Shaikh Mohammad Bin Iza, a brother of the Shaikh of Bahrein, had just arrived in London on a private visit and had called at the Legation. He was anxious to pay his respects at the India Office and to be received by the Secretary of State. He also wished to know whether it was proper for him to w r rite his name in The King^ Book at the Palace. Monsieur Zada subsequently made it clear that the Shaikh was not staying (as at first appeared to be the case) at the Hejaz Legation. We have no information of Shaikh Mohammad’ s movements, beyond that a Persian Gulf Diary for February 1932 mentions that he had then left for India. He has presumably come here direct from India, which would account for our failing to receive any warning or advice fran the Gulf authorities. I have mentioned the matter to the Foreign Office (Mr.Rendel) and private Secretary, and propos-e-, in the i/O' light of conversation with them and with approval - writeokto Monsieur Zada to-night as in the draft attached. We might simultaneously telegraph to the Gulf/t Gulf (l doubt if it is worth troubling the Government \ K of India) as in the second draft. If the Shaikh* s visit is straightforward it will probably be desirable that he should be received by the Secretary of State and that arrangements should be made to have him put on the List for a Palace Garden Party. But we had better make sure where we stand by enquiry from the Gulf before we coninit ourselves officially in way. There can be no objection to his calling privately in the Political Department, while writing his name in The King’s Book is merely a sign of respect of /cov*—^ nature—erf—the SIid:ikl* 1 p virrit hi?,ve and commits nobody t o anything.n 9th June p 1932* Dear Monsieur Zada, I am very sorry that owing to a long standing previous engagement it is impossible for me, as I explained to you on the telephone, to accept the minister’s very kind invitation to luncheon to-morrow to meet Shaift:Mohammad Bin Isa, but I should very much like to have the pleasure of meeting the Shaift} and wonder if it would be convenient for him to call at the India Office one day - at any time suitable to him. The Secretary of State is, I fear, very heavily engaged for the next few days, and I have not been able to make any arrangements about an interview with him, but,if the Shaifti is remaining in London, Sir Samuel would, I am sure, very much like to make his acquaintance, if this can be arranged. As regards the £hir4&gt; point you mentioned to me I am advised that it would be entirely in order and in feet in accordance with the usual procedure for the Monsieur Wahmood Riyad Zada.
