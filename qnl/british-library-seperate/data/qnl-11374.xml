The latter document touches upon the hostility between the Turkish [Ottomans] and the Idrisi; it also discusses the Idrisi's concerns over whether Britain will win the First World War, and how this would impact upon the agreement and on future relations with the Turks.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>First Assistant Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author; correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Idrīsī Imām of ʻAsīr</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Farasan Islands</geographic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00028d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00028d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
