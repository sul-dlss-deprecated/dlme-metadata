HAMILTON, Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Fort William, the 31st March 1898. My Lord, * Sub-enclosure in Enclosure No. 11. Your Lordship’s Secret Despatch No. 7, dated the 26th February 1897, approved the arrangements made for the political control and protection of the desert tract between Nushki and Koh-i-Malik Siah. We have the honour to forward further papers including a report * by Lieutenant Webb-Ware, Political As sistant, Chageh, on his visit to Seistan at the beginning of last year and on the measures introduced for the development of trade between Baluchistan and Persia. Your Lordship wished to know what steps we took towards making a road from Quetta to Nushki. In his forwarding letter, Mr. Barnes states that there is a fair camel-track between Nushki and Quetta; that for about ten miles, where it passes through low hills, the track might he much improved if funds were forthcoming; but that, except on this portion, nothing in the way of road-making is at present required. Our orders will be found in our Foreign Secretary’s letter t of the 18th February 1898. f Enclosure No. 14. 2. It is too soon yet to judge whether there is much prospect of an increase of population or cultivation, or whether it is worth while to attempt to levy a light revenue, in Chageh and the Western Sinjerani country. As to this and as to the affairs of the Nushki district, we await the result of the further enquiries which Lieutenant Webb-Ware has been making this season. Mean while we have agreed to the retention, during 1898-99, of an establishment of postal sowars, temporarily entertained last year to keep up communication with Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh in Seistan ; and we have tentatively sanc tioned for the same period additional levies, for employment on the route, and have made grants for the tour expenses of the Political Assistant and for petty public works.3 Your Lordship’s Revenue Despatch No. 209, dated the 2nd December 1897 commends to our attentive consideration a suggestion that Consular Agents should he appointed at central points between Seistan and Meshed on the trade route from Quetta to Meshed. We shall, m due course, address Yo r Lordship on this subject. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Tour Lordship’s most obedient, humble Servants, (Signed) ELGIN. „ J. WESTLAND. „ M. D. CHALMERS. „ E.

No difficulties that I can think of. are likely to he experienced by Lieutenant Webb-Ware in entering Seistan, provided that he has not delayed on the way. Translation of a letter, dated the 12th February 1897, from the Hashmat-ul-Mui.k, Governor of Tabas and Seistan, to Lieujenant-Colonel C. E. Yate, C.S.I., C.M.G., Agent to the Governor-General of Indiaand Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Khoras- san and Seistan. After compliments .—For a long time past I had no information about your good health and was very anxious to hear from you. The post that has just arrived from Khorassan (Meshed) has brought your kind letter. I am very glad to hear that you are quite well, and that, after a long journey in Europe and in Persia, you have safely returned to Meshed. It gives me great pleasure to get this opportunity to renew our old friendship, and I am thank ful for this. As the ordinary post is leaving, I write to trouble you with these few words. Last year I went from Meshed to Tehran, where I had an audience of His Majesty the Shah. I stayed at the capital for about five or six months. During my stay His Majesty showed me great favour and kindness, and, in addition to the Government of Seistan, conferred the Governorship of Tabas also upon me. After leaving the capital, I came to.Tabas, where I arrived about three or four months ago, and now I am engaged in performing services to my Govern ment. This is an account of the state of my affairs. I have understood what you wrote about yourself. With regard to Mr. Webb-Ware, am officer of the British Government, whom you have recommended to me, and about whom you have sent me a letter of recommendation from the Governor-General of Khorassan and Seistan, I have made myself acquainted with the matter. Of course, officers of the British Government will be served and treated with great honour and distinc tion wherever they are, especially the officers who are recommended by you, with whom I have old friendship. In accordance with the order of the Governor-General and your recommendations, I sent the necessary instructions to my son Sartip Mir Masum Khan, Deputy Governor of Seistan, at once, and enjoined him to receive Mr. Webb-Ware with the necessary ceremony and honour, to serve him well in every way, to carry out his wishes, to send him any supplies that he may require without delay so that he may not suffer any inconvenience, and to treat him, during his stay on that frontier, with due respect and distinction. So you may rest assured about this matter. The cover to the address of Mr.'Webb-Ware, which was enclosed in your letter, has also been sent to Seistan with instructions to the Sartip to cause it to be delivered to Mr. Webb-Ware on his arrival at Koh-i-Malik Siah, and to obtain and send me his answer in order to enable me to forward it to you. I have also written a short friendly letter to Mr. Webb-Ware himself. I have no more trouble to give you, and hope that, contrary to the past, you will always write and tell me of your good health and let me know if I can be of any service to you, 989 F. D.2 Enclosure No. 2. Extract from the Chageh Diary for the period 9th March to 10th April 1897. fT 18th March iSP?'.—Despatching the “ barbardari ahead m the eaily hours of the morning, we mounted the horses proffered by the Tahvildar for the occasion and started for the last stage ol our 650 mues march. This march, although but IQi miles, was a peculiarly trying one, owing to the country traversed being cut up by countless deep, narrow irrigation channels with water averaging in depth up to our horses girths. I was surprised to find the crops so late; they are at least a full month later than at JN ushki; this and several other small points would lead one to suppose that the Seistan climate is one whose warmth is much maligned. One of the coldest days I ever recollect was passed in Nasirabad. A mile out of the city we halted to enable news of our near approach being communicated to the local officials. Dor this they appeared fully prepared, as we were only kept waiting a few minutes. Half a mile from the fort of Nasirabad we were met by Naib-ul- Hukumat with a ragged following of some forty odd sowars, dressed in their best. The Naib proved to be a wizened little man verging on the “sere and yellow leaf ” with eyes possessing peculiar eccentric orbit of their own. He received me, apparently, with marked cordiality, expressed the pleasure our presence animated him with, apologised for keeping us waiting at Hussain- abad, and paid us innumerable compliments, which being an Irishman I found no difficulty in repaying with interest in the same coin. When the mutual exchange of compliments had ceased, the Naib inquired of me as to what was my pleasure, viz., to visit the Sartip at once, or do so the following day. To this I replied that I was anxious to discharge the duties incumbent on a visitor as soon as was consistent with the Sartip’s convenience. On this the Naib-ul- Hukumat led the way to the fort, within the walls of whose citadel is the official residence and darbar hall of the Deputy Governor of Seistan. After being kept waiting a few minutes—no doubt purposely—the Sartip appeared. He is a youth of about 16, whose corpulency, half-closed eyes, and air of extieme lassitude, proclaimed a weakened constitution, and enfeebled intellect, consequent on a life spent in undue indulgence in the enervating pleasures of the harem. With the young Sartip appeared also his uncle, and guardian—if I can use the term—Syed Khan, Chief of the Naruis, cousin of the murdered Darwesh Ah. After the customary mutual inquiries as to one another’s health and interchange of the prescribed compliments, we took our leave, to be con- thp C fW by the -a N a^ Ul ’ Haknma ^’ With similar formality, to the house, outside the tort, provided for our reception. fnn.

They listened with attention, enquired as to whether I had any power to mitigate the severity of the crushing dues the Amir imposes on their traders, dues, they affirmed, that were slowly hut surely crushing their trade, stated they were fully aware of the great benefits that would ensue from the steps I had taken to protect caravans—the most important of which they appeared to consider was Ido Pahlwan’s submission—and promised to discontinue by every means in their power future raids from Persian into, British territory. Added to the above, they guaranteed protection to our traders while within their jurisdiction. Of promises they were lavish, but as to whether they will carry them into effect is a far different matter. Previous to the Sartip’s taking his departure, I pointed out that, loth though I was to pay so hurried a visit, my duties imperatively demanded my immediate return to my district, and requested that, in view of this, he would favour me by issuing such orders as he deemed requisite to ensure my supplies, camels,Jetc., being forthcoming at an early date. To this the Sartip pledged himself. ***** * * * * * Enclosure No. 3. No. 3975, dated Quetta, the 25th June 1897. From—H. S. Barnes, Esq., C.S.I., I.C.S., Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, To The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a letter No. 130, dated the 19th June 1897, with enclosure, from the Political Assistant, Chageh, requesting sanction to the issue of certain Government arms and ammunition to the levies on the Nushki-Seistan caravan road, 2. There is no doubt that the caravan road from Amir Chah to Koh-i- Malik Siah is much exposed to raids from the Damanis and other tribes in Persian country, over whom the control of the Persian Government is very slight. Our levies, so far, are armed with their country swords only, and I think it would have an excellent effect if a selected number of them at the different posts were armed with old Snider carbines. These desert posts are at great distances from each other and very lonely, and it would add much to the security of the roads and also of the posts themselves if the levies were known to be well armed. I therefore support the Assistant Political Agent’s recom mendation, and should be glad if the carbines he asks for could be provided. They need’not be of a high quality. Old carbines, of which there are pro bably plenty in store with the rifling worn smooth, would answer all purposes. No. 130, dated Quetta, the 19th June 1897. From— The Political Assistant, Chageh, rp 0 rjq ie Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. I have the honour to solicit that you will favour me by approaching Government, for sanction, to arm the tribal levies employed in safeguaiding the lately opened Nushki-Seistan caravan road with a free issue of “ called in ” Government Snider carbines. 2. Events which have recently occurred have borne home to me, very forcibiv, the paramount importance of arming my levies in such a manner as will enable them vigorously to assume the offensive against such parties of4 the Si-Sultln! aSTetweLThe’TaterSeMd 111 junction^f ^h!

W. Brazier-Creagh, A.M.S., To—The Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, I have the honoui to forward, for your information and favourable trans mission to Grovernment of India, the attached recommendations I consider it advisable to carry out for the protection and encouragement of trade with Seistan and Khorassan, etc. 1. That in view of the great scarcity and difficultv in obtainin 0 * supplies either by the very poor nomad Baluchis and Kafalas en route, would strongly recommend that each of the thanas be supplied with flour, barley, and c^hee to be retailed at proper values to all comers. 2. Many of those I met on journey were eating roots, fungi, and grasses consequent on famine. Consider it advisable to send an Engineer Officer along these routes next cold weather with some Sappers and Miners, etc., to repair and re-dig wells along route and thus secure a proper and adequate supply of water. In several places where long weary marches have of necessity to be made owing to complete absence or foul supply, new wells will of necessity have to be dug and stone built inside to prevent their falling in and guard against surface drainage of foul nature again flowing back into wells, as camels, sheep, etc., are watered close, and most wells are in consequence polluted and source of sickness and disease to travellers. 3. A trough should be built with gutter leading from an elevated plat form on which the water is raised up. 4. Iron pulleys fixed for raising the water. 5. Willow trees might with little cost or trouble be planted along water way at thanas where there is running water, viz., Dalbandin, Sandaik, Tazgai, etc., etc., and particularly at Bobat, our frontier outpost, where there is a good supply of water. 6. A set of rules for the guidance of the thanadars at all stations, fixed rates for all supplies, and above all protect the wood (trees) as much as possible, or fuel must in time be nil. A few thousand rupees spent thus will be wisely laid out and a judicious encouragement to traders. 7. Traders should be protected on arrival at Quetta as far as possible from the brokers and rigged prices, and the bunniahs now at Nushki, into whose hands several of the Jalk traders have fallen and are in debt (vide previous reports under date 12th April 1897), should be prevented from intercepting onward journey to Quetta. Seistan ; | G. W. BBAZIEB-CREAGH, The 13th April 1897, ) $urgeon»Major, A.M.S* No. 159, dated the 6th July 1897. From— Lieutenant F. C. Webb-Ware, Political Assistant, Chageh, To—The First Assistant to the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. In reply to your No. 3987, dated the 26th June 1897, forwarding certain suggestions by Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh on special duty in Seistan, as- 6 steps that might with adrantage trade route, I have the honour to he taken to develop and improve the new submit the attached remarks. protectioi 1 To me the very first consideration of all appears to he the safety and sction of caravans passing along the new tra e rou e. _ - travellers will he deterred at the outset from facing Neither caravans or assure d that they have nothing to fear forlhe^afety oTtheir goods while in transit. Since my return to Quetta I have been interviewed by more than one trader and almost the very first query nut is : ‘“will Government guarantee_ the safety of our goods and indemnify us for loss resulting from robbery or raids ?” . 2 The next consideration naturally is the comfort of caravans using the route.' Under this heading “facile princeps” comes the matter of water- sunnlv between Nushki and Robat (Koh-i-Mahk Slab), excepting along two stretches, one of 65 miles and one of 42 miles. The present supply is sufficient to meet the exigencies of all caravans. The supply can well be, and I trust shortly will he, greatly improved, facilities for drawing water increased, etc., etc., but still, as I have just said, excepting those stretches referred to, the supply is ample. Three wells are thus required. One is already nearly com pleted, two still remain. To detail a party of Sappers and Miners to dig two wells, of an average depth of, say, 30 feet at a distance of 300 miles from Quetta, appears to me rather a waste of scientific energy, a small party of Pathan navvies amply sufficing. The difficulty we will have to contend against is wind-driven sand. I found that almost invariably the accumulation of sand in wells was due, not to the collapse of either mouth or side walls, but to the action of sand storms. This is so thoroughly recognised by natives that the system they adopt, on these sand-swept wastes, is to cover over the entire well mouth, flush with the ground, only leaving a small orifice available through which mussacks can be lowered. They say, to build up any projection, against which sand can lodge, ensures a drift forming, and the well being quickly blocked up; whereas under their plan, the driven sand is swept across the mouth, very little effecting a lodgment in the small orifice left open. No one who has not had personal experience of the country I am dealing with can conceive the rapidity with which, should a drift once form, wind- driven sand is capable of choking wells. o. The ground in the vicinity of old wells’ mouths—wells in use for genera tions is so thoroughly saturated with filth and polluted to such a depth that, cover cuer the mouth as you may, nothing short of sinking new wells up S i !- ef |™ 5 ar remov e( ^ ^ roni ^ ie polluted ground, and keeping them solely for ( rm ’ing purposes, will avail: percolation from a shower of rain at present being sufficient l' 0 ren der their water temporarily undrinkable. of well wf c . om “ o nly in vogue to prevent the damage or collapse 01 well mouths was both simple and effective. squam^framework^nfV 8 e + xca ^ ate( ^ 1° .^l 16 depth of three or four feet, then a built up well backed wit} 6 runks ^ud branehes, the size of the well shaft, the friction of both “T' 5 ' 1 St0,1&lt; ?- The Rework within takes off taction 0 both buckets and ropes, and preserves the well from injury. increased! 101 ’ 165 “ drawln S water and watering camels might well be one occasion made’by'me^ t0 136 O|X0&lt;1 al,ove wells ’ mouths were on more than tive to matter of stovirig ■ Brazle r-Creagh’s suggestion rela- greatly to^h e popXn\vof e ?hfrome OOI t t0 k aVelle - 8and earavans &gt; and add godowns, or thanas, would of neoes^itv h 01 + e _ sto _ rl ug of the supplies proper As this is, however, a matter that wilHi T 6 °a ? e au( ^ agents appointed, m my report, I will refrain h ffrom with atsome ^ttle length 8.

Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh is labouring under a misapprehension when be says that a necessity exists for protecting traders, on arrival at Nushki, from brokers and rigged prices” Seistanis are free to dispose of their wares in whatever market, or place, that may suit them best and no pressure has ever been put on them to compel them to act otherwise’ Of the bunnias whose names Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh mentioned under his report dated 12th April 1897—Purso and Jaita Mai left Nushki upwards of two years ago ; beyond this, no case exists in which a Seistani trader is indebted to a Nushki bunnia. P. C. WEBB-WARE, Lieutenant, Political Assistant, Enclosure No. 5. , No. 1437-C., dated Ziarat, the 29th July 1897 (Confidential). From—H S. Baunks, Esq., I.C.S., C.S.I., Agent to the Governor-General in Balu chistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1787-F. dated the 8th July 1897, forwarding certain papers regarding Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh’s visit to Seistan. ° 2. 1 am of opinion that it would be well worth the expense to place a British News-writer in Seistan. From what we have learnt from Surgeon-Major Brazier-Oreagh and Lieutenant Webb-Ware of the influence in Seistan of the Russian News-writer, I think it would be worth while to send there a representa tive of the British Government even apart from the interests of the new trade route, for Seistan is a part of Persia with which British interests generally are very closely connected. But in addition to this, seeing how easy it is for the Persians to obstruct the new route by vexatious trade regulations and how cer tain it is that the influence of the Russian News-writer will be used against us in the matter of trade, it appears to me very important that after Surgeon- Major Brazier-CreaglFs departure a trustworthy native should be left in Nasir- abad to keep us informed of the progress of events and to, or through, whom our traders may apply, if necessary, for assistance. It would not be difficult to find a suitable man for the appointment, and the pay should not, I think, be less than Rs. 200 a month, apart from the pay of the Kasids or sowars required to keep up communication with our frontier post at Robat. I enclose, for the information of Government, an extract from Lieutenant Webb-Ware’s coming report about his recent tour, which will show that he too is at one with Surgeon- Major Brazier-Creagh in thinking such an appointment desirable. 3. As regards Robat, I do not consider that any additional official is required. We already have at that post a jemadar of levies and a munshi, though, perhaps, the latter might be better paid. But I do think it is of import- ance that Lieutenant Webb-Ware should be given a good Native Assistant to help him in managing the road and the Chageh district and whom he can leave in the desert during the hot weather. He has already frequently felt the want of such an officer, and I am sure that the appointment of a native official of greater weight and influence than the one vernacular munshi Lieutenant Webb-Ware at present possesses is really essential in order to help him in his jirga work and to assist in looking after the country. 1 would place this official’s head-quarters at Chageh in the hot weather whence he could easily control the new route via Merui from Amir Chah to Dalbandin, and in the cold weather he would tour along the route either with or independently of the Political Assistant in charge as may be most convenient, or could be stationed between Amir Chah and Robat. It seems advisable that in the hot weather we should have some one on the 400 miles between Nushki and Koh-i-Malik Siah of greater authority than the jemadars of levies, and if we are to collect any revenue from the country, such an appointment will be a sine qua non. I would fix the pay of this native official at Rs. 150 rising to Rs. 200, and would give him for the present an office establishment costing about Rs. 90 a month. 1 Munshi Rs. . 40 1 , . . . 30 2 Peons at 10 • • . . 20 Totai . 908 4. With regard to Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh s remarks about Muham- marl A kram Khan Mr. Webb-Ware informs me that the man m question is Snllv an Ishakzai Afghan of Las Jowain, that he does a considerable business as a cloth merchant and camel contractor in Seistan, and that beyond hiring to him a few camels he rendered him no assistance. Extract. “ I was disagreeably astonished to find what ascendency Russia had appa rently gained over Seistan, Their policy towards the country appears to have been a very advanced one, ours just the reverse. To my surprise I found that a Russian News-writer had been located in Nasirahad, the capital, for upwards of three years, and the influence he exercised, or the fear he engendered, in Seis tan, synonymous terms was astonishing. I trust Government will answer this move by at once installing a British Agent in Nasirabad. Persia can offer, under the circumstances, no opposition. If Government does not take the step, I affirm without hesitation that the development of a direct trade route between Baluchistan and Seistan is hopeless. We have already had an instance of the influence Russia is capable of exercising in the institution of the late absurd plague cordon which, while I was in Seistan, was only employed as an engine to preclude direct trade communication between Quetta and Seistan, while between Makran and Seistan travellers and traders were free to come and go unquestioned.” Enclosure No. 6.

Seistan and Kohistan, from the point of view of trade, have up to now turned to India from where they received ioreign goods by the Persian port of Bandar Abbas, Only the increase in power of the Bam mountain robbers has forced the native merchants to turn towards the north, and through Khorassan to enter into trade relations with Russia. 4 That bond has not yet succeeded in becoming secure, and doubtless this new and entirely safe road, purposely made so as to be free from impositions (the Persian trade caravans, by arrangement of the English, are freed on the whole load from every local impost and taxation), will break this bond a^ain and for a long time. The loss of Kohistan and Seistan is not for us so important as the possibility of a considerable entry of English goods into Khorassan. ‘ By and uith v hat means are we to fight the English competition there? About this we must think much.” This gives a rosy picture of the Nushki-Seistan route, which, I am afraid, is far removed from the actual facts. Hie Russian writer talks of the guards protecting the caravans from Baluch robbers, but Lieutenant Webb-Ware gives a very different account. In his diary for the 1st May 1897, Lieutenant Webb-Ware says Raids through the most westerly portion of my district are a matter of daily occur rence. Only a few days prior to my arrival at Assad Chah, a party of raiding Eamani carried off two camels and one man; the man escaped. I have just received information that a kafila was attacked near Tuzghi by another party, and two men killed, while a party of the same tribe actually had the audacity to march to attack us; that they saw good reason not to carry out their amiable project was a source of much regret to all. &lt;( These same Damani are Persian subjects and live in, and raid from, Persian territory. I would respectfully suggest, under these circumstances, that the Persian Government be taken to task for permitting the existence of this intolerable state of affairs. “ The Damani in all do not number a thousand men, so the plea of inability to coerce them cannot well be advanced.” Again, in his diary for the 16th May 1897, Lieutenant Webb-Ware fur ther reports that the Pishin horse trader, who was given a letter to me by Mr. Barnes, the Agent to the Governor-General for Baluchistan, as mentioned in paragraph 1 of my diary for the week ending 25th June 1897, and who was turned back by the Persians at the frontier after his long journey of 644 miles across the desert, suffered severely on his return journey. Lieutenant Webb-Ware says:—“On his way back from Koh-i-Malik Siah, near Tuzghi, he was attacked by a party of 15 Sirhadi raiders. Erom his account it would appear that he made a most plucky resistance, and it was only after being severely wounded himself through the neck, and after one of his camels had been killed outright, that seeing further resistance futile, he and his small party of six abandoned their property and fled. This incident will give you a very fair idea of the assurance of these trans-frontier raiders ; it must be remembered that Surgeon-Major Oreagh had passed Tuzghi with his large escort but four or five days previously. I fear that we will find it an exceedingly difficult matter to put down raids in a country which lends itself so naturally to them. Nothing could possibly be more fatal to the reputation of the lately opened route and nothing will exercise a more adverse influence in discouraging others from giving the road a trial than the experi ence which this the pioneer party of Pishin merchants met with.” Lieutenant Webb-Ware does not mention where these Damanis came from, but presumably it is from Sarhad, and the first thing, I take it, to bring home a sense of their responsibility to the Persian Government will be a formalclaim for compensation for the men killed and wounded and the property carried off. Once the Persian Government are made to pay up this, they will be ready to bestir themselves to prevent further claims in the future, and I would suggest that an official he appointed on either side to form a joint commission after the manner of the agreement entered into between the Russian and Persian Governments for a joint commission on the Khorassan fVnn+ipv ns not, fid in narasTapk 3 of my diary for the week ending 18th June 1897 The Governor of Persian Baluchistan will then be bound to co-operate with Lieutenant Webb-Ware in tracing and punishing these raiders. Meanwhile, till things settle down a bit, it will evidently be necessary to increase the number of levies along the road and to have strong guards with all travellers and caravans. Enclosure No. 7.

The raid ing is in Baluchistan, British Indian territory, and can be dealt with there. If the road is worth opening, it is worth protecting; a severe lesson to the raiders from our side of the border would effect much and give rise to no mis givings on the part of the Persian Government.

Government of India, a copy of a letter * received from Lieutenant P. C. Webb- Ware, Political Assistant, Chageh, requesting that he may be granted a special allotment of Bs. 5,000 to meet expenditure connected with a tour he proposes to make during the approaching cold season to the Persian frontier. 2. In Poreign Department letter marginally cited the Government of No. 2961 -f., datod the Both October 1896. India sa “° tio ?ed an allotment of Rs. 3,000 per annum for the Political Assistant’s office establishment and contingencies. This sum, as stated by Mr. Webb-Ware in his letter, has been distributed as follows :— Office establishment Office contingencies Bs. 2,400 600 It is evident that a sum of Bs. 600 per annum, or Bs. 50 per mensem, is insufficient to meet anything except the Political Assistant’s ordinary office contingent expenditure, and I regret that this point was not brought to the notice of the Government of India at an earlier date, though it was incident ally referred to in my letter No. 1247-C., dated the 12th July 1897, in which I applied for sanction to the provision of the camp equipment required for the use of the Political Assistant and his office. 3. Last cold weather the Government of India were pleased to sanction the grant of a sum of Bs. 6,500 to meet initial expenditure connected with Mr. Webb-Ware’s tour through the desert and Koh-i-Malik Siah. This sum, with levy savings, was found sufficient to cover both the initial expenditure incurred by Mr. Webb-Ware and his tour expenses, that is to say, the hire of camels for carriage of tents, treasure, and records and for the baggage of escort and levies. Last year, too, it was found necessary to provide some camels for the carriage of sick followers. I think it will be evident that these legiti mate and necessary tour charges cannot be met out of the Bs. 50 per mensem available out of the original allotment, and that a further grant is necessary if Mr. Webb-Ware is to make any tour at all. The Political Assistant asks for Bs. 5,000 and a further small grant for sinking wells between Manzil and Saindak. But if the Government of India will give an allotment for tour expenses of Bs. 4,000 for th,e current year, I will endeavour to meet all expenditure including the cost of sinking the wells out of this sum. 4. Mr. Webb-Ware’s report on his last year’s tour has unfortunately been delayed owing to pressure of work in the Sind Press, but I hope it will shortly be in the hands of Government. Mr. Webb-Ware has frequently brought to my12 r a flip importance of a more accurate survey of the country between DalbancUn and the Persian frontier. I would strongly recommend that if nntihle a surrey officer should be detailed to accompany the Political Assist- ant on thk yea* tour, and if he can be spared, Mr. G. P. Tate would froin his previous experience, be the most suitable officer for the work Also, if it is possible so to arrange, I would suggest that an officer of the Geological Depart- merit should be appointed to accompany the Political Assistant and to report on the yarious valuable mineral deposits with which the country seems to abound. 5. As Mr. Webb- Ware is anxious to start from Quetta on the present tour early in October, I shall be glad of early orders on this letter. ^ Mr. Webb- Ware should spend as much of the cold weather as possible in the desert, exploring the country and shortening and improving the trade route. I hope, too, that”much may be done in encouraging immigration into and cultivation in parts of Dalbandin and in completing arrangements for the collection of a light grazing tax and other forms of revenue. It would be a great assistance also if the Government of India would sanction the appointment of the Native Assistant and establishment suggested in my No. 1437-0., dated 29th July 1897.

Whether this procedure is or is not possible will depend on the ability of the Assistant Political Agent to determine the number of rounds legitimately expended each year.

Ware, Political Assistant fh • on the results obtained by the measures sanctioned last year for the’nolitfcal control and protection of the country between Nushki and aeistan and P nf t «f 1 trade route by which it is traversed. I much regret the delay which has taken place in the submission of this report, which, it will be seen, is dated the ISth July It was sent by Mr. Webb-Ware to the Sind Government Press to bt printed, but owing to the pressure of work connected with the plague it could not be put m hand for some weeks, and it only reached me a few days ago * 2. Lieutenant Webb-Ware’s report is very full and interesting, Jnd I think the Government of India will agree that he has carried out the work entrusted to him with much zeal, tact and ability. Although the number of levfes allowed for the purpose was not large for a road over 460 miles long, he has neverthe less succeeded m opening and protecting the trade route, and in establishing British control throughout the Sinjerani district, and he has also done much tf introduce better order into the Khan’s district of Nushki, The scheme which the Government of India had in view has been well and successfully sfarted and though trade operations were unfortunately hampered for sonm time bv the restrictions found necessary in Seistan on account of the plague in Indm the route bids fair to be popular, and has already been traversed by several caravans. Including the local traffic between Nushki and Quetta, the total value of the export and import trade from February to August has already attamed the very respectable figure of Bs. 2,96,892. As the route becomes better known, and as that portion of it which lies between Amir Chab and Koh-i-Malik Slab becomes better protected from the occasional raids of the Damanis and other Baluch tribes on the Persian side of the border, there is every reason to hope that trade will considerably increase. It certainly ono-ht to increase if the route can be made reasonably safe and easy, for, with the excep tion of the route through Kashmir and Leh to Yarkand, it is now the only free trade route by land from the North-West Frontier of India to the countries beyond. The heavy duties levied by the Amir have done much to discourage trade with and through Afghanistan, and it is not impossible that the new route may in time revive much of the trade which used to pass through Herat and Kandahar to Meshed. It may also attract a considerable portion of the trade which now goes by sea to Bandar Abbas and thence into Eastern Persia. 3, I have not much to add to what Mr. Webb-Ware has written, and until he has done another cold season 5 s work in the country, it will per haps he advisable to defer making any specific recommendations for the future either in regard to Nushki or the administration of the Sinjerani country, more especially as the Government of India have decided for financial reasons to limit Mr. Webb-Ware’s tour during the coming cold weather. But there are a few points on which it is desirable to say a few words. First, in regard to Nushki, I am afraid there is very little doubt that the Nushki district will never be properly kept in order or properlv developed so long as it remains in the hands of the Khan of Kalat. The Khan takes no interest whatever in the district, and, without our assistance he is quite unable either to keep the peace between the various sections of the Rakshani and Mengal tribes, or to prevent raids from or across the border. He is also averse to spending any money either in providing proper district establish ments or in developing cultivation. Consequently, if he is left to himself, he is never likely to obtain more revenue from the district than the few thousand rupees which his Naib is at present able to collect. The lands round Nushki are very fertile, especially the (i dak ” or alluvial plain through which the floods of the Lora pass on their way to the Chagai Hamun, and if Bunds to 547 F.

An ^ ^ , rli ’ trict remains under the present Khan’s —rsr'Si. ti'«“ wm .„.»d u» .,o« y wh» the Political Assistant can arrang w hich to us is the matter of more trade route through t le us endeavoured with their aid to settle and Xt aeTettTement o'f the more acute tribal feuds, but beyond this he can notTnterfere in the administration, and untU there is some stronger form of Government the district cannot be expected to improve In these eircum- stencesT hare no hesitation in saying that far the most satisfactory arrange ment for all parties would be to induce the Khan to assign this district to the British Government for an annual quit-rent, as he has done m the case of Quetta. If this could be arranged, I have little doubt that in a few years the revenues would more than cover the cost of administration. A good Tahsildar with a small office staff, and a force of 30 or 40 armed police, would probably he all the establishment * that would he required, and with the security that would follow settled government, cultivation would very largely increase, and the Nushki Bazaar would become an import ant trade centre. The control, too, of the resources of Nushki, which is the only fertile and well watered tract on the road to Seistan, would make much easier the task of supplying and protecting the road beyond through the desert. I have discussed the matter more than once with the Khan, and have impressed on him the necessity for improving the administration of Nushki. He is naturally very reluctant to entertain the idea of alienating the district, but at the same time he is very fond of money, and if it were made worth his while, I think his reluctance might be overcome. Por the present he has agreed to instruct his Naib to assist Mr. Webb-Ware in every way possible, and at my suggestion be has also promised to send a few of his irregular soldiers to Nushki to support the Naib’s authority. Por the coming cold weather I think it will he sufficient to wait and see how these arrangements work. If they do not work, or if, in any case, the Government of India would prefer the other alternative, the matter can he taken up in the spring. 1 . T mgards the Sinjerani District, that is to say, Chagai and what Mr. Y\ ebb-Ware calls the Western Sinjerani country, it is too soon yet for me to e a e o say with certainty whether there is much prospect of an increase of popu a ion, or cultivation, or whether it is worth while to attempt to levy a ^ even lie. 10 m the Nushki border to Koh-i-Malik Siah the country is a or wM’AT»l &lt; l?i meS i S san ^’ hi11 , 3 interspersed with stretches of alluvial “ pat” the noo£-oo.i y JJ“ S ' ^” ? e f i m T tPar + t V, itiSabSOllltely WaterlfiSS &gt; bufc f0r stiucted along the caravan tracks.

He will also be able to form a better idea this year whether there is any probability of new karezes being made, or old ones reopened, in the alluvial tracts near Sbakarchab and in Dalbandin, where there are many signs of former cultivation. But I would suggest that the result of his enquiries this winter should be awaited before any orders on the subject are passed. If revenue is to be collected, it would be necessary to give Mr. Webb-Ware the services either of a Native Assistant as proposed^ in my letter No. 1437-0., dated the 29th July, or at any rate of a Naib-Tabsildar with a small establishment, but it is, I think, very doubtful whether any revenue we could collect at present would cover the cost of collection. If Nushki were leased from the Khan, no doubt the native officer in charge of Nushki could also collect, without increase of expense, such dues as it may be found possible to impose in the Sinjerani district, and could act as Native Assistant to the Political Officer; so in this respect also the acquisition of Nushki would be an assistance in the administration of the rest of the country. On the whole, unless we are to administer Nushki, it seems to me the informa tion we have got is not yet sufficient to justify any expenditure on a revenue collecting establishment. 5. As regards the matters mentioned in paragraphs 21 and 28 of Appendix 1 of Mr. Webh Ware’s report, I may mention (1) that Sardar Ali Khan, Sin jerani, has been told that he will not be allowed to levy transit or custom dues of any kind whatsoever, and (2) that I anticipate no difficulty in effecting a satisfactory settlement with Sirdar Sir Nauroz Khan in regard to the boundary between Kharan and the Sinjerani district. Sir Nauroz is as anxious as we are that a boundary should be laid down, and I will endeavour to come to an agreement with him on the subject as soon as a convenient opportunity occurs. It is also desirable that the boundary between Nushki and Dalbandin, and Nushki and Chagai, should be ascertained, and Mr. Webb-W T are will be asked to make enquiries and report on these points during his winter tour. 6. The only other important point on which I need touch is the strength of the levies employed to guard the road. I am afraid the present force of levies which was sanctioned in Foreign Department letter No, 2961-F., dated the 30th October 1896, at a cost of Rs. 19,200 a year, and of which a list * is attached, will hardly be sufficient as a permanent arrangement. The distances between the present thanas are very long, and as Mr. Webb-Ware points out, the danger of raids from the Damanis and other Perso-Baluch tribes make it very necessary to strengthen the posts between Amir Ckah and Koh-i-Malik Siah. Moreover, as they stand, the posts are not sufficiently strong to enable regular postal communication to be kept' up between Koh-i-Malik Siah and Nushki. , 0 TT This is only rendered possible at present f See list II attached. , i , .i- 1 . because of the additional postal sowars f subsequently sanctioned at a cost of Rs. 430 a month for the purpose of keeping up communication with Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh in Seistan. Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh has now returned, and if these sowars are with drawn, the chain of posts will become dangerously weak, and the arrangements made will be likely to break down. I would therefore very strongly recom mend that 1 may be allowed to keep on permanently the postal sowars tem porarily sanctioned by your telegram INo. 1000-F., dated the 21st April 1897. These sowars will be the more necessary if there is any intention of replacing Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh by another officer or of appointing a British News-writer in Seistan, as suggested in my letter No. 1437-0., dated the 29th July 1897; and in any case I think experience has shown that without them it will not be possible to keep up regular communication between the Post Office at Nushki and the frontier tliana at Robat, which is a matter of importance to the proper control of the district. Also since his report was written Mr. Webb-Ware has sent me in a proposition statement for * See hst IIL additions to his levies | (besides the postal sowars) at a cost of Rs. 310 a month in order to strengthen the Amir Chah and Saindak thanas, to place another post between Saindak and Robat, and to give some service allowances to some of the headmen of the Mamasani Baluch who inhabit the desert w 7 est of Amir Chah. The allotment, too, of4 ' Es. 28,200 * granted last year indudes not^ * Levies • • Office establislinient^ .

To provide for ■ expenditure under these heads, I think a grant of Rs. 5,000 t is at present required, and if to this is added the cost of making the postal sowars permanent, and of entertaining the additional levies asked for, a total additional grant of Rs. 13,880 a year is required. I am afraid it will hardly be possible to provide this sum from Provincial funds, and yet the expenditure is, I think, very necessary if the route is to he properly guarded and developed. 7. The road at first traversed by Mr. Webb Ware on his way to Seistan proceeds from Dalbandin to Galachah and thence by Assadchah, Isa Tahir and Kundi to Amir Chah. It will be seen, however, from the map that this road makes a considerable detour to the south, and it was found that parts of it near Galachah lie very low and are intensely hot in the summer months. On his return, therefore, Mr. Webb-Ware moved his posts to a more direct line between Amir Chah and Dalbandin, via Marui and Manzil, and when the road is properly marked out, this will no doubt be the route which caravans w r ill take. It is nearer the hills, and therefore higher and cooler than the lower road, and it is some 65 miles shorter. It is also almost entirely free from sand. There is also a road from Kundi through Maskija direct to Saindak, which avoids Amir Chah. This was the route traversed by Surgeon-Major Brazier- Creagh and his party of cavalry on their way to Seistan, and as it also is almost entirely free from sand, Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh thinks it would be a better line for troops to march than that by Amir Chah. As the country is for the mos t P ai t quite flat, no road making is at present required for camel tramc. All that is necessary is to mark out the road clearly so that travellers may not lose their way. This is now being done. Between Nushki and Quetta there is a fair camel track via Kanak, the Barak pass Kirdigap.

Much of Ve country in Dalbandin and between the Hamun-i-Mashkhel and Amir Chah and the Perso-Baluch frontier is still unsurveyed. It seems desirable also that the mineral products of the country, which are said to he numerous and valu- able, should be examined by an expert. There appear to he considerable deposits of red and yellow ochre, iron ore, sulphur, galena and sulphate of alumina. The hills from baindak to Robat are also said to abound in copper.1897 .

(c) Western Sinjerani country, or that tract west of the line just drawn and enclosed between the Baluch-Afghan and Balucs- Bersian frontiers. 1. riie Nhshki district to all intents and purposes is inhabited by onlv two tribes, the Zagar Mengal and Rakhshani. Of these, the former, if we include the nomad members, outnumbers the latter in the proportion of seven to one. In former times, the whole of Nushki undoubtedly belonged to the Rakshani, with its rich arable lands and pasturage, and this they retained till conquered by the Mengals. The fact that the' proprietorship of the land is chiefly in the hands of the Rakshani affords sufficient evidence that the Mengal yoke pressed hut lightly on the Rakhshani. Beyond being stripped of a lew lands and the right to levy a tax on passing merchandise, they were left pretty much to themselves. The explanation of this appears to he in the fact that the Mengals, by inclination, were essentially a pastoral race and, as large num bers do to the present day, preferred bartering their surplus stock for grain to engaging in the uncongenial toils of cultivation. To come down to more modern times, the Mengals are divided into two great branches—the Babin i and Nozai, each of these branches in turn being sub-divided as follows, viz., the Badini into the Bajarzai, Tarasizai and Amirzai ; and the Nozai into the Mahmtjdzat, Mandai, Ahmebzai, Baranzai ; and each of these sub divisions is again still further divided into from six to eight Tomans. All the Nozai branch, and the Tarasi5i sub-division of the Badini branch of the Mengals, are migratory ; that is to say, that, while owning extensive lands in the Dak, on the southern side of the frontier, they pass the major portion of the year—and in years of drought, the entire year—pasturing their flocks in Afghan Eegistan. 'While none dispute the Sardarship of Muhammab Alj Khan, Bajarzai Mengal, yet, since the Baluch-Afghan Boundary Commission finished their labours last year and many of the leading migratory Mengals visited Kabul, they have not shown themselves so ready to acknowledge the Sardar’s sw r ay as of old. 2. The order of precedence of the branches into which the Rakshani are divided is as follows : the Babini, Jamalbini, and Manbai. The latter branch is of little account, as the Babini and Jamalbini, long years ago, combined to crush them and strip them of their possessions, and thus it came about that the Manbai Chief, Baloch Khan, was reduced to his present impoverished condition, B. The Babini and Jamalbini, having overthrown the common enemy, straightway turned their attention to one another. Por over thirty years have these two clans been struggling for the supremacy, fortune sometimes favouring one side, sometimes the other.

On such occasions, ,o a head and involved the country m desulto^ohn ' ^ of the factions with contempt as soon as it got to a safe distance from Quetfou Of late yea ^ pvpr oi nce a small punitive thana has been posted at Nlshki, the force avauaine has been too weak to give effect to judicial findings. Intermittent attempts have been made by the Thanadar to act up to Ins orders, but a rifle shot, or tin threat of a loaded pistol, has warned him of the folly of attempting impossi bilities. 6. The only other occasions of our intervention I can trace have been when the Zagah Mengal Sardar, in whom the right to levy a tax on passing merchandise has been vested for many successive generations, has seen fit to heap such burdensome dues on merchandise bound for the Quetta market as to threaten to extirpate all trade. This action has occasioned on our side the entry of protests, to be forgotten almost as soon as received. The cause of our apathetic policy towards the district is probably to be assigned to the fact that INtjshki and its Dak form a continuation of Shorawak, and that, as nothing exists that can possibly be construed into a well-defined natural boundary, we were apprehensive of identifying ourselves too closely wdth the country, lest we should be continually embroiled with the Kandahar authorities in disputes regarding the limits of the Baluch-Afghan boundary in the vicinity. 7, As to the Khan, he appears to have taken hut scant interest in Nushkl I t must he remembered that the portion of Nushki acknowledging his direct sway is only the tew hundred a res watered by the Kaisau Stream, with its ramifications, and the Dak lands immediately in the vicinity. As regards the Mengals who lived outside these limits, they have been subjects of either Khav or Amir, as suited their purposes best; but it is worthy of note that their leanings as shown by the reference of their disputes, is most markediv towards Afghan rule. A recent exemplification of the same leaning was given us at the conclusion of last year’s Boundary Commission, when all tie loading lomandars, though in many cases owning lands w r ell within the KaluaT spheie of influence, were induced to journey to Kabul and offer their a logi n e to the Amir, to he rewarded wdth khilats and apportioned various scan s oi pay. rx , b ; ' 1 ; 10 JF 18 : 1 ' 1 s to have absented himself from Nushki * u n w ’ ie - Ver attem r ,ted to consolidate his master’s rule, but plb, ’ ' ^ !S j lf ” co ' ie '' year by year gradually slipping from his revenue' n, rhe ^rfin 00 ’ 11 ^., UD ? se ^ d - y collecting an ever dwindling revenue. Ihe Khans authority m Nushki has thus daily become moreshadowy; revenue has been collected only at the point of the sword ; water the private property of the Khan, has been seized upon and divided; the allow ances which the Zagah Mengal Sardar has hitherto received from the Khan have been discontinued. The various factions, Mengal and Rakhshani, have quarrelled and fought, and quarrelled again, just as pleased themselves. And as to whether the Mengal and Rakhshani cultivated their fields in peace, or put their numerous feuds to the issue of the sword, appears to have interested the Khan but little. This is a matter for comment. It is evident that in proportion as these inter-tribal feuds became more acute, so more lands were thrown out of cultivation and revenue diminished. The key to the problem is to he found in the policy of the Khan’s Naib, who, fully recognising the precarious nature of his master’s tenure in Ntjshki, has been the foremost in fostering these same inter-tribal feuds and quarrels, with the deliberate object of keeping the various factions apart and preventing any combined action, which would first be directed towards his own overthrow. Had not last year s Boundary Commission taken place, the Khan would have been compelled in the immediate future either to take decisive action to re-establish his fast waning authority on a solid basis or be satisfied to see Nushki slip from his rule for ever. 9. The revenue the Khan enjoys is derived from two sources, viz .— (o) Land revenue at the rate of -i^th on all produce, excluding that of Sardar Muhammad Ali Khan Zagar Mengal, and his “ following.” (6) Two sheep annually from each Toman in the name of “ Mehmani.” As to the actual amount of revenue so raised, it is difficult for me to offer an opinion, as there are no records to which I have access. On arrival at Nushki, I was told by the Naib’s Assistant that it amounted to merely “ thora tukra mithi” or nothing, whereas the Naib, on my return a few months later, placed it as high as Rs. 5,000. According to my latest researches, I believe that the amount realized last year, and paid to the Khan, was Rs. 4,700, and this figure may be taken as fairly accurate. 10. We are now confronted with the problem as to what is to he our future policy towards Nushki. With the conclusion of last year’s Boundary Commission, under which no less than 80 miles of Nushki bordering on Afghanistan have been carefully demarcated, the only excuse we ever possessed for holding aloof has been swept aside. To maintain our policy of indifference longer is impracticable. As Capt. McMahon, when Boundary Commissioner, very truly pointed out, the presence of a number of irresponsible Chiefs on the frontier, answerable to no one, is calculated to keep us conti nually embroiled with the Amir, and to be a source of continual weakness, if not of actual danger. 11. Krom what I have just said, I think no one will question that the district must be administered in future under the supervision of a British officer. Shadowy and precarious as I have shown the Khan’s authority to be, and likely at no distant date, had the old regime continued, to have been summarily extinguished, still G-overnment is averse, and rightly so, to permit ting the cession of any integral portion of a Native State to British adminis tration. Thus, only two courses appear open— {a) Either to take over, under an amicable arrangement with the Khan * the administration of Nushki, judicial and fiscal, giving the Khan in exchange a fixed amount of, say, Rs. 15,000, or close on four times’ the value of the revenue which he has of late years enjoyed. 5 (5) Or to call on the Khan to administer the country on lines that promise some hope of success. And an essential feature of such an administration—as on it would hinge the entire success of the plan— would be the appointment of a capable, trustworthy official, with some small experience of British methods of collecting revenue and administration, and answerable in all matters relative to revenue6 direct to the Khan. To give this appointment to a Kalat official of the ordinary type would, I feel assured, inevitably entail failure, rudely shake new-born confidence, and be inadvisable to the last degree. If, however, either of the schemes be adopted, funds will be required to provide accommodation for district officials, the necessary administrative buildings, and above all for the construction on the Dak of few simple irrigation works. These, owing to the conformation of the country, need not be of an expensive nature, and they would operate to catch the overflow water of the Pishin Loka, which now flows aimlessly on the Lora Hamun, there to perish instead of discharging its proper functions in watering the rich and fertile alluvial lands known as the Dak. No better scheme could be derived for winning the people over to pacific pursuits than to supply them with a sufficiency of irrigated land for agricultural purposes. 12. Up to the present, I have refrained from touching on a most impor tant question. I refer to the protection of the lately demarcated frontier, especially that portion bordering on Shorawak. On my arrival at Nttshkc* this matter engaged my early attention. In a darbar to which I summoned the* most influential men in the district, I warned all that attempts to infringe the integrity of the frontier by perseverance in such practices as they were ad dicted to, using Nushki as a base, would meet witli speedy punishment. My words have had a far deeper effect than I anticipated. Not a single case has come to my knowledge where the frontier has been violated from outside. * coul( J sa y ttiat the state of things had been reciprocated, but as a matter of fact frequent cases have occurred in which raids have been committed in Kalat territory by offenders who, have crossed the Shorawak borders The boundary between pillars cxlvi and clvii is, as far as Afghanistan is “kh'a v lcLIt T ?, the V T7 ?r mor of Shoeawak, MuhTmmau same JAHAN Acha&amp;zat, a despicably feeble creature, addicted to the use of toWtoibutr h: w C0, i7 P , t -i t t ? the last de ^ ee * tWs state ^ - mamfv has the stomp „f 00 ^X 0 °/ ^3’t^’ J 0 3 that raiding from personally interested motives.

Some sixteen years back, the Khan found * i the Zagar Mengal Chief to cede a half Jordon of the net “ t0 C T Pe ] from “ Sung ” collections to Kalat. Till then, the dues levied were^n accord 1 ance with a scale in vogue generations, and fairly reasonable. The result of tills was, as one might anticipate, that the Zagar Mengat 1 himself for the heavy loss sustained, forthwith enhanced the dues, in some S so heavily as to amount to an increase of 100^ , with such disastrous results to trans-frontier trade as quickly made themselves felt in Quetta The Octroi Darogha called attention to the serious diminution in such imports as ghi and wool Sebtan merchants and Ntjshki traders complained bitterly of the extortion they were subjected to; and on certainly 'one occasion ^ British officer was deputed to halt at Nushki to report on the matter. The only result of his visit was that further protests Were addressed to both Khan and Zagar Mengal bardar, to which neither paid the slightest attention Very soon, the consequences made themselves felt further afield. Seistani mer chants m despair sought other markets for their goods, and many Nushki Bamahs emigrated m search of fields offering more profitable investments. Ihe few Seistani kafilus which continued to find their way to Quetta either made a detour through Shorawak to avoid NusHKl-having once paid toll to the Afghan authorities at Chagai, they had nothing further to fear— or when their numbers warranted a chance of success, fought their way through 16. Trade converges on Ntjshki from five different sources: (а) From Jalk, via G-alachah and Dalbandin, chiefly dates. (б) From Seistan, via Amircha*®- and Dalbandin, sheep, goats; local Seistani products, including ghi, wool, namdahs, carpets. (&lt;?) From Garmsel, via Khawaja Ali, JRobat (Malik Dokand), ghi, wool, grain. {d) From Eastern Helm and, via the Purdil Khan Road, wool, ghi, grain, dried fruits. (e) From Shorawak, by numerous routes across the frontier, ghi, wool, grain. 17. Government, by allotting to Sardar Muhammad Ali Khan a fixed annuity in lieu of his hereditary right to levy “ Sung,” and thus freeing the district from the dues trade had struggled against so long, has given a sorely needed impulse to trade, and the good effects of this arrangement have already made themselves widely felt. The fruits of this liberal policy, I unhesitatingly affirm, would, had it not been for the action of Persia in closing Seistan to traders, have been a stream, though possibly an intermittent one, of camel-borne trade between Quetta and Persia. Closing Seistan to trade has exercised —it is to he hoped but temporarily—-a most disheartening effect on those traders whose enterprize prompted them to venture their wares by the new route. To my certain knowledge, three test caravans were refused permission to quit Seistan, and several others were turned back on reaching the frontier. The trade that has thus benefited by the abolition of “ Sung ” has been confined almost solely to the local Chagai-Nushki-Shorawak trade. That this trade has benefited is clearly established by the re-opening of several shops in Nushki and by the general revival evinced by Nushki imports and exports returns, which show transactions aggregating, for the months of February, March and April 1897, Rs. 95,247-lS-0. These figures, however, must be taken as merely approximate, for although most trade un doubtedly passes through Nushki, yet a portion, which cannot well be ignored, finds its way to Quetta by other routes. 18.

CHAGAI. 19 At the conclusion of last year’s Boundary Commission and the conse quent withdrawal of the Amir’s posts to the Helmana, Sardar Ali Khan Sinjerani was re-instated in Chagai. 20. He appears to have signalized his restoration by arrogating to himself such Sardari rights as he enjoyed of old, relating to the levying of . Sung and to the raising of revenue, and by a violent quarrel with, his Naib, Dost Muhammad, whose services during the late Boundary Commission had been the subject of special commendation from Capt. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E. The upshot of all this was the retirement of Naib Dost Muhammad to his Jalk property in disg.ust, and a strongly worded protest from the Political Agent, Kalat, as to the matter of levying “ Sung,” to which the Sardar does not appear to have paid the slightest attention. In accordance with the direc tions I had issued prior to leaving Quetta, I found Dost Muhammad, who had hut lately returned to Chagai, awaiting my arrival, and he was joined at a shortly subsequent date by Sardar Ali Khan. I commented strongly on the Sardar’s action in levying “ Sung,” and desired him to discontinue the practice. To this, he acquiesced with ill-concealed resentment. On handing him the Government resolution confirming his pay as a service allowance, and announcing its increase by a sum of Rs. 50, as a reward for Naib Dost Muhammad’s good services, Sardar An Khan’s jealousy and resentment again showed themselves. He positively refused to entertain the idea of paying his Naib the sum appointed, and withdrew in high dudgeon to his tent, where he sulked the next two days. Eventually, he acceded to the provisions of the resolution, but very sore at heart. The truth is that Sardar Ali Khan is but a poor creature, weak and vacillating, without any moral force of character, and entirely m the hands of his numerous relatives, who play upon him in the manner which best suit their individual interests.

The Chagai district may be said to consist of two fertile portions, mz., the alluvial plain surrounding Chagai fort and Dalbandin. The former is watered by one single and two double karezes, but the supply of water from them could be considerably augmented by a little judicious excavation. At present, it is unequal to local requirements. Jfrom the contour of the sur rounding hills and from the depth at which water lies, I agree with Capt. McMahon in believing that the present number of karezes*couXA. be largely increased. Unfortunately, pressing business compelled my immediate return to Nushki, and so I cannot speak with the assurance of a recent per sonal inspection. 24. Owing to the very limited attention I was able to devote to the subject, I am somewhat diffident of committing myself as to the amount of revenue that could be raised; but, after careful consideration of the question, I think that, while the amount raised by a land tax under present circumstances would be very inconsiderable, the expenses of a small tahsil and sowar establishment, with a branch thana at Baramchaii, could be met from the Tirni collections on the very large number of flocks— sheep, goat, and camel— the district supports. Judging by the events of late months, the population of the district promises, under British administration, to increase to an astonishing degree. In illustration, I may say that, whereas at the time of my outward journey through Dalbandin I collected with difficulty 20 men, at the time of my return upwards of 2,000 were reported by the Thanadar to be pasturing their flocks on the broad expanse the plain offered. This was no doubt partially due to failure in the rains around, but the view taken on both northern and southern frontiers is clearly proved by the presence of Afghan and Kharan officials charged with the duty of preventing further egress. 25. As I have just said, I consider that the cost of maintaining a small tahsil and requisite establishment at Ghagai could be met from a Tirni collec tion. That the collection will at first be unpopular, I foresee; but when the Baltjch realize that, in exchange, personal security for themselves, to leave alone that of their flocks, will be secured to an extent hitherto not dreamed of, I think that the slight uneasiness it may give rise to will quickly wear off, never to re-appear. 26. Dalbandin may be best described as an extensive plain, of an average breadth of 8 —10 miles, confined on the north and south by the Chapar and Raskoh hills, and extending east and west 20 miles, until it is lost in heavy sand hills. Cultivation by means of karezes is only attempted in the vicinity of the Dalbandin river, where a small irrigation channel, 18 inches wide by 4 deep, is utilized to cultivate some 20 acres of ground. With a little care and expenditure, the yield of water could be materially improved in the upper reaches of the rivei% but lower down the presence of extensive salt beds renders the water unfit for irrigation purposes, and precludes all hopes of the water-supply being very extensively enhanced. Examination revealed the existence of numerous patches recently under cultivation a few miles up stream. On my enquiring of the owners as to why these lands were neglect ed, the universal reply given w r as that the inducements to undertake culti vation under Sardar Ali Khan’s sway were not sufficiently attractive. 27. Outside Chagai and the direct vicinity of Dalbandin, there is but little cultivation. A few miles north-west of Ohagai, a small karez supplies sufficient water to irrigate a few acres, while at Marui and in several places in the Chagai Sarlat are old karezes which only require repairing to be brought into use again. I saw during my tour, on many occasions, places wdiere light bands thrown across the mouths of nalahs would afford sufficient water to irrigate considerable tracts in the vicinity, and many other places, notably Chahsir, where the proximity of water to the surface gave promise &lt;of fine heads of water. 28. A matter of considerable urgency, as regards the welfare of the district, and with it the, caravan route, is the approximate demarcation111 mu iiiiii i nil iiiiii I? 1 «*• U &gt; -f ^ ^ ^ ^ 10 of a boundary between Khakan and Chagai. Parties of Kitaran sowars frequently penetrate through the Raskoh Kambean range into what is asserted to be, and generally known as, Chagai territory, and there, adopting the procedure of the Ohagai Sardar tax collectors, they carry off all they can lay hands on, and then beat a hasty retreat across the hills. Phe plea advanced by the Kharan people that, under an old Afghan Scificid, the Washki a alah fell to them will not bear close scrutiny. The Amir s post at Chagai never recognised any right of theirs, but regularly collected all the revenue they could from the vicinity. These incursions have given rise to a feeling of continued in security, and if the matter is not taken in hand, it promises shortly to develop into a serious difference, even if it does not lead to actual bloodshed. 29. The protection of the district’s northern frontier is also a matter that demands some consideration. During my late tour, I was repeatedly ap proached by trans-frontier Baluchis who desired to settle within our frontier. On obtaining my permission to do so on condition that the rights of present occupants should be respected, all, almost without exception, earnestly begged me to station a small post in some place on that frontier, such a&amp; Baramchah, for their protection and security, and as a tangible proof that they were living under British protection. I am strongly of opinion that their request should be granted. Between Kani and Jiljil, the frontier runs through a mountainous district, affording excellent pasturage for its numerous flocks, °and recent events in Nushki go to show that the Afghans will not be deterred by a mere line of boundary pillars from crossing the frontier to levy revenue on tribes they have long regarded as under their direct authority. TEADE. sub i ect , ^ bave b ^le to say, for there is no trade indigenous to the district. Among the Chagai Sarlat hills, out-crops of salt and alabaster T' th - and judging by my experience further west, an organized seaich !S likely to reveal the presence of mineral deposits. Indeed, the sand hills throughout the district contain a high percentage of very finely divided iron, an interesting fact I have never previously seen alluded to. a ready sal'Tn ^ ^ ^ nUmberS of flocks « district finds does ^not smffiee^C The Sim?v' e is Sasoli, and the few scattered Mengal and Narhi Tn ’ 1 ti 0K1 ’, Mamasani &gt; of importing such extra c-ainTf y-7, ^ Tomans, all make a practice Amir forbid the export of »rain- hv an' le T ulre ^ ro . m Gaemsel, Should the then very great hardship will enlue 7 . “ lm P robable contingency,— WESTERN SINJERANI COUNTRY. ^ have separated the tract whinT-, t t t • country from Chagai proper for the reason (Lt f 0 des iS n ? te&lt;i the Westeen Cnagai Sardar never extended beyond the^U' I a , Uth ' rlt y en joyed by the boundary of the Chagai district, and that the r, | a f down as the eastern thus acknowledging that his interest in ^ ^ land ? of ^^ons to have from the s “i 80 r« rf “'' ,4es - whos e crimes and Rl , 5 PU , te \ and the favoured ?r°m the society of their fellows Thon Jh T f d 11 deeds ha ^ driven them IS subjected to continual raids.

The Damanis are divided into four sections—the Tab HtTHAMMABZAr the Gumshadzai, the Sueezai and the Gtjngozai, and own alltriance to one Jihinb who resides, with his fellow clansmen, secure in the roSky fast? nesses of the. Koh-i-Suffaid m Persian territory, whence he issues cmlv to ra d. Ihirmg the month of July, the Damani venture down to Muksotag^ Kundi, and Gorani on the plains below to gather their date harvest but speedily retire. The tribe in all numbers but 800 men. Por the Persians weak though they have latterly shown themselves on this frontier, to plead’ inability to coerce this petty tribe appears to me absurd. The present situation is intolerable: either the Persians must reduce to order the unruly tribes on their border, who raid with impunity from the security their frontier affords, or we must safeguard the district. To do so in our case however would involve the holding of the Galachah Paniham road at considerable expense, a large increase m the present Levy force, and the establishment of another thana between Robat and Amirchah, with the probability of a second strong thana being requisite in some suitable position on the Mirjawa River, The Damani, in the few dealing they have held with British officers, have hitherto evinced a friendly disposition, but as they are essentially a predatory tribe, relying on raidina &gt; as a means pf subsistence, it is greatly to be doubted whether any steps short of physical force will avail to compel them to desist from a practice they have been engaged in for generations, and probably the task would prove the more difficult in this case as they have long regarded this strip of country as a preserve of their own. J 36. At Saindak, a strong thana is, in my opinion, requisite in any case. The distance between Amirchah and Robat, 155 miles, is too long a stretch of country to be unprotected. The Saindak chauki, manned by local Levies, is quite inadequate, and scarcely reliable. Should raids continue, the desira bility of posting a thana somewhere in the vicinity of the Mirjawa River must, as 1 have said, be seriously considered. Should Government be disinclined to face the expense involved by the establishment of so many thanas, a possible alternative would be to post a strong thana at Saindak —a step which cannot well be avoided—, and to place the charge of the road west of Amirchah in the care of some influential Baluch Sardar, allot him, say, Rs. 150 for pay and such service as he requires, and hold him personally responsible for the repression of raids. Such an appointment is necessary, for the presence of thanadars being essential at the various posts, they can, in case of a raid, only follow the track up for a day or so and then return to their duty. A Baluch Sardar, on the other hand, with no imperative duties to bind him to the close vicinity of the caravan route, could with the assistance of his followers pursue raiders with vigour and persistency, and, being thoroughly versed in their modes of procedure, it is to be hoped, compel them to turn their attention elsewhere. 37. To me, it is a cause of considerable regret that the demarcation of the northen portion of the Perso-Baluch Boundary was permitted to follow so exceedingly weak an alignment as that selected. A far more natural and infinitely stronger frontier would have been that offered by following the Mirjawa River up to its source, thence running direct to Koh-i-Malik Siah by the Bundi and Shamidar Passes. To such a line, the Persians, whose interest in this remote corner appears infinitesimal, would have offered little or no opposition, and it would, while securing to us a frontier naturally strong, and well to the south of the Kacha Hills, have placed us in possession of a well watered strip, quite different from what it is usually supposed to be, and containing what, at present, is the only practicable road, viz., that by Said Langar and Bogar. Added to the natural weakness of the present boundary, it offers raiders such exceptional facilities for plying their trade as will quickly attract their attention. JBadraashes have but to lie up in themm? y 12 hills above, secure within IgLX passing along the daman ^°iT’ c ^ nce of suocessfu! pursuit. On the map, half an hour b?luch Boundary, after leaving the Mirjawa the line foUowed by the Peb *°'? a , . o n the ground, I have been unable to River for Koh-lMalik Siah,^ ^ a °^ h the district, judging from trace it-a difficulty m which the balu^ ^ ^ esist&gt; l do nQt questions they put me, evident y p P si( j ei . a - 0 iy i n the modesty of their question; but most certainty J mllars I found marking the northern dimensions from ‘he f^srve stone b p BE f IAN officials as boundary Even wWe n SEiSTAN^ « q uth _ east of Koh . i .

To assess this wild country to revenue, unless a tax on minerals and assafoetida were contemplated, would be useless. The amount ^ised J°uld necessarily be infinitesimal, the expense of collection considerable, and the means of evasion simple. Added to this, nothing would tend more to discourage those Baluch from settling in the District whose presence I count on to effect its ultimate pacification. TRADE. 38. Erom time immemorial, the assafsetida clothed slopes of the Koh-i- Sultan yearly induced large numbers of Pathans from Kandahar and Kakars, from places even so distant as Zhob, to quit their homes to gather it. But beyond assafsetida, the same barren range has large deposits of sulphur, alum, two kinds of ochre (much sought after for dyeing), copper and antimony. To the west of Koh-i-Sultan, the hills are seamed with out-crops and veins of ore, some exceedingly rich. The presence of ancient copper and lead smelting furnaces testify to these deposits having been known, and having been in use, for ages; while excavations of quite recent date show that the workings are not disused. An exhaustive geological survey of the district is much needed, and would yield most valuable results, 39. Sarhad as a market for the purchase of stock is already attracting attention. Two droves, one of 400 sheep the other of 800 goats and sheep, have already marched down the new trade route, and arrived safely in Quetta. Given a continued demand, it is not improbable that this may prove the initiation of an extensive industry. r&gt;APPENDIX II.

J-. 1 A ! nl ° st immediately after my arrivalin Nushki, an opportunity offered i se o ringing home to ail the fact that Government, had inaugurated a new departure and was determined that in future the person of traders and the property of caravans should be regarded as sacred. It came to mv knowledge that a small Seistani kajila had been seised and plundered by the Jamaldini Saidar under the plea—a mere subterfuge—that one of hi/entourage had been subjected m Seistan to a like outrage several months previously. I and tbi^-?-'’! ril t0 ? 1Spe i fr ° m the Sardar ’ s mind the belief which he f^ir inU K “r 6 f' 1 J ° 11? sllal ' ed that ever y weakly guarded caravan was their an and legitimate prey. And to ensure the discontinuance of similar out rages, I publicly placed the charge of all caravans passing through Nushki in !?‘e hands of Muhammad Ali Khan, Zahar Menhal, -now a paid Govern ment^ servant -, telling him that any less they might suffer would be required at Ins hands. That not a caravan has since been subjected to either ■outrage or oss bears testimony to the fact that the Sardar has acted up to ms responsibilities. 1 rWE i 0, !wf ^ r ; tb / an 1 uai T 1897 ’ 1 received the welcome news that Govern- ment had allotted to Sardar Muhammad Ali Khan Ks. 7,000 yearly in lieu of ms hereditary right to levy “ Sung.” The Sardar had greeted my arrival inu Kushki with ill*cone occurred in his bearing, distrust as marked i’rom as that day, however, a change „„ marKe(l ptoiiing; henceforth, he enlisted - , ’ and X hate nothing but praise tor his con- himself unreservedly k V, t0 the extent of Its. 1,54, t39-lo-0 has u Sung add that the revival of trade is shops in Nushki. . . ., honefits which the abolition of 7.

With the final settlement of the country and with the erection at Nushki of a tham, a small trading bazaar will quickly arise. Eager enquiries have more than once been addressed to me as to when a tliana will be erected, and on my enquiring the reason for the questioner’s anxiety for such a building, the answer has been that be proposed moving to Nushki as offering a better base for conducting bis business. 9. Up to Dalbandin, I had not thus to indent on my Quetta-raised Levies ; bere I proposed stationing my first tbana, and this was quickly arranged. Leaving with the L’hauadar instructions to guide him in his- dealings with Natives and caravans, and halting only sufficient time to enlist such local Baluch aa were requisite to bring the post up to its full Levy strength, and impressing on the Thanadar the imperative necessity for starting work on this thana at once, I hurried on to Galachah. I may say here that, on my return, I found a tine roomy thana not only finished but in actual occupation, a building whose construction reflects great credit on the energy and industry of the post. 10: Of Gaxachah, 1 will say but little, as it has since been abandoned or reasons presently to be stated.

I was considerably puzzled at fim to get material for the construction of the thana. The ground is so impregnated with sand that as a building material it is quite useless; and yet there was nothing else. Finally, I was driven to erecting a square stockade ot “ Tagaz ” trunks, against which a five-feet wall of b mlders has been piled, while inside is a roomy “ Tagaz ’’-thatched shed, which owing to its coolness is very popular among the sowars. If only mortar were available, th inks to the numerous blocks of stone that strew the vicinity of the well, no difficulty in constructing a suitable building need be anticipated. 12. Leaving my third thana posted at Amirchah, I directed my march to Saindak, a distance of 67 miles, which, owing to l ick of water, was quite the most trying portion of the journey. Last year, Capt. McMahon was lucky in finding at Dranatt Koh a pool of dirty water. No such luck fell to my lot. From Amirchah to Saindak, and again from Saindak to Amirchah, three and two days’ marches, respectively, as I made them, our camels had to go waterless. For the development of the road across this stretch, two wells are urgently requires. I trust the end of the year will see both completed. One well—-which l h.^ar is over 40 feet deep has aheady been sunk, hut work, owing to the heat, has been temporarily suspended, and this has also been the case in respecn to a well naw in course of construction to the north of the Koh-i-Sultan, midway between Amirchah and Manzil, where there is another long waterless stretch of 42 miles, and the only other one between Quetta and Nasirabad. 13. While I was halted at Saindak, a local Tomandar, named Ido, much dreaded of caravans, came in. Such terror has this individual inspired that no caravan or party, unless well armed, dared of old to pass his lair. Saindak is so situated that, should he he so inclined, this personage could block the route and cause great trouble. In old days, Seistan caravans avoided Saindak, and after'leaving Burj, in Persia, they used to march direct tor -Vmirchah, skirting the northern shores of the God-i-Zirreh. jhis Ituc v, ivin^ as it does within Afghan limits, is clearly no longer practicable. Lo Ido leave the choice of Government service or ejection. He accepted the first alternative—I confess to my relief—, as to root him out of these rocky retreats would have proved a far from simple task Ot his conduct since then, I have no cause to complain: he has discharged his duties m carrying the dak surely, although at times somewhat slowly. 14. Of my further journey to Koh-I- Malik Siah, I have little to relate. On the’outward journey I followed the “daman” north of the hills,—a very rough, circuitous track, cut up every few yards with boulder-strewn n*lak&gt;, andTpassin 0 ’ north of the line of boundary pillars at a point within a tew miles of Robat. ’On my return, I tried the southern road vid Bouab, Said Lanoab -md Kirtaka, a preferable route on every account; mlee l,us only disad- vnnta-e lies in the tact that, according to the map, it passes between Robat and Kirtaka outside British limits. lo At Robat, my fourth and last thana was posted.

And here X should like to point out how imperatively necessary it is that the southern Seistan-Afghan frontier should be clearly demarcated, To do this would be an easy matter, for, between Koh-i-Malik Siah and JJend-i-Kamal the I^erso-Baluch boundary runs in a straight line across sand hills and barren desert, containing not a single point I am aware of to which either Persian or Afghan can possibly attach any importance. The demarcation of this frontier is a matter intimately connected with the welfare of the new route, and I trust that it will not be lost sight of. Up to the present, the long expected Pathan post has not arrived at Koh-i-Malik Siah ; but that orders have long been issued for the institution of such a post is a matter of public knowledge. 17. In oeistan, although the orhcials I met were outwardly the personi fication of politeness and hospitality, it needed little insight to perceive that they viewed my visit to Seistan with uneasiness, not to say suspicion. This appears to have been due to an absurd rumour which was current that Government intended annexation, aimed at absorbing all southern Seistan and, by diverting a portion of the water of the Helmand, proposed to reclaim the broad alluvial tracts north of the Shela river. My visit was, so it was rumoured, only the prelude to a vigorous development of this programme lo combat this distrust was my first aim. I declined to permit Seistan oardars to have audience of me, excepting in the presence of Persian officials a policy on which I had cause to congratulate myself subsequently before leaving the country, when I learned that many questions asked bvBALUCH Sardars were put at the instigation of the leading Persian officials.

(b) That depots should be constructed at convenient centres (such as at Robat, Amirchah, Merui, and Dalbandin) for the supply to caravans of the necessaries of life. This is a scheme that is worthy of careful consideration. Its adoption would involve the erection of expensive godowns at each centre, the appointment of Agents at Nasirabad and Nctshki to replenish stocks as they ran low, and the appointment of a small staff, whose pay might well he met from the profits on sales. Some such scheme as is here suggested would be quite feasible, would confer great benefit on traders, and go further than anything else to popularize the route. (c) That the Amirchah thana should be strengthened. Amirchah, as I have shown, dominates the entire western Sinjatani district. I consider that the strength of the thana should never be allowed to fall below 20 sowars. (d) That a thana should he established at Saindak, with a branch chauki midway between that place and Robat. (&lt;?) lhat a chauki should be erected at Manzil, (/) That a sufficient sum of money should be placed at my disposal to ^ e f e a g an g of Pathan labourers for employ- o ^ eatl ! er ’ we h'sinking and on such other works most pressin 1 1 ^ 8ve ^°P m ent of the route as I may consider ^ ^hrou^uTiw Van route fr? 131 Nushk! to Robat should be marked 1 ^ especSij'horwf ll sh^uld , bfi I ^' V ' ng j atCr , aa&lt;l wateriu S a”'™*! 8 . throm-hout th^ !. ncrca8ed - As grass is to be fouad to be anticipated.^ *' a con8 iderable trade in remounts is addition^^Lev^sowars' ente''?^ 'if a * KlsHINGI &gt; and tw&lt;) service with bead-quarters at KardLIp' ^ Qaetta ' Nushki dak assistance to^iaraml trade^sT 46 * 1 ! *“ ? uetta to affor&lt;1 every best markets for the sale anri S ’ ^ u P^ ace them in touch with the their interests generally, P^chase of goods, and to supervise(k) That rules should he framed for the regulation of caravan traffic while passing through Quetta, so as to secure its freedom from local taxation—bonded warehouses being established, if necessary, (/) That a sufficient force should be stationed at Nushki to prevent further outrages and to enable the administration of the district to be efficiently conducted. (m) That more commodious thanas should be erected at the various centres. (w) That 20 baggage camels (five for each centre) should be purchased for carriage of grain at a cost not exceeding Rs. 60 each. 29. If, added to the above, the services of officers of the Geological Survey, Trigonometrical Survey and Intelligence Departments were placed at my disposal for the approaching cold weather tour, valuable results would ensue.

May I keep up the postal sowars costing Us. 430, a month, sanctioned for maintain ing communication with Surgeon-Major Brazier-Oreagh, pending orders on the recommendations made m the paragraph 6 referred to ? These men have not yet been dismissed as Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh returned unexpectedly and there was a probability of his being replaced. Their dismissal now will, as explained, dangerously weaken the posts in the desert, and I think the sowars should he maintained permanently both on this ground and also to keep up regular communication with Mr. Webb-Ware when he is on tour and with the Itobat Tliana at JCoh-i-Malik Siah at all times, even if no one is sent to Seistan; if Abbas Ali is sent to Seistan, it will also he necessary to maintain communica tion with him. Lieutenant W ebb-W are’s control will be much 'weakened if these men are withdrawn, and any repetition of raids on caravans will have a serious effect on trade which bids fair to increase considerably. My report shows that Mr. Webb-Ware asks for extra levies even in addition to the postal sowars, and I think retention of the latter is the minimum with which we can successfully manage the control of the long desert route. I should be glad of early orders. Enclosure No. 13. Telegram No. 5390-F., dated the 28th December 1897.

Cuningham, K.C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, To—The Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. 1 am directed to reply to Mr. Barnes’s letter cited in the margin regard- ' No 143 », dated the 29 th Jui, 1897. ing the Nushki-Seistan trade route. In No. 7661, dated the 25th November 1897. the first of these, Mr. BamGS Suggested the appointment of a Native Assistant in Seistan on a salary of 200 rupees a month, and that Lieutenant Webb-Ware should have a Native Assistant to help him to manage the road and the Chageh district. In the second, Mr. Barnes forwarded, with further proposals, a report by Lieutenant Webb-Ware on the results obtained by the measures sanctioned in 1896 for the political control and protection of the country through which the trade route runs. 2 The Government of India deferred consideration of the proposals in the letter of the 29th July last, pending receipt of Lieutenant Webb-Ware s renort on his last winter tour. This unfortunately was delayed in printing, and only reached the foreign Department in December. I am now to convey orders on both the letters under notice. 3 Lieutenant Webb-Ware’s report has been read with interest, and the Government of India agree with Mr. Barnes that he carried out the work entrusted to him with zeal, tact, and ability. 4. The report shows that the Nushki district is in an unsatisfactory con dition,* that the revenue has been steadily falling off, and that the K an 989 F D.2 A tt- i a j ooant interest in the tract. Mr. Barnes has deferred specific Kalat mpndations in regard to Nushki, until the Assistant Political Agent has X”it C Id season in the district. He is inclined to think that the P ! + c !fkLtnrv arrangement would be to induce the Khan to assign the Strict to the British GoTernment on an annual quit-rent; but the Khan is reluctant to entertain the idea. Bor the present, the Khan has agreed to instruct his Naib to assist Mr. Webb-Ware in every way possible and to send I few of his irregular soldiers to Nushki to support the JSaib J s authority. Mr Barnes proposed to wait and see how these arrangements worked during the*present cold weather. When fuller information has been gained, it may, perhaps, be possible to come to a satisfactory understanding with the Khan. 5. Mr. Wehh-Ware was only able to devote a limited amount of attention to the revenue possibilities in Chageh and the Western Sinjerani country. Mr. Barnes says it is too soon yet to judge whether there is much prospect of an increase of population or cultivation, or whether it is worth while to attempt to levy a light revenue. Mr. Webb-Ware is visiting Chageh and its neighbourhood this winter, and will try and frame an estimate of what it might be possible to collect. Pending the result of these enquiries, Mr. Barnes suggests that orders should be deferred. The Government of India agree that this°question should be held over until more information has been obtained as to whether there is a reasonable probability that the revenue forthcoming would cover the cost of collection. A further report will be awaited, and meanwhile the proposal to appoint a Native Assistant to the Political Officer must also be held in abeyance. Should it be hereafter necessary to revive the proposal to appoint a Native Assistant, I am to suggest that it might be feasible to provide funds for the appointment and for any small establishment necessary for the *r s . 2 , 000 . Assistant from the existing allotments* ” 1 ’ 600 - for establishments and contingencies. It is not understood why it was proposed that the Native Assistant should have more than one munshi, or why he should require any peons, when levies would probably be available for such duties as peons ordinarily fulfil. 6. Mr. Barnes has furnished a statement showing how the annual grant of 19,200 rupees for levy service is distributed, and he is of opinion that this amount must be increased if the safety of the road is to be assured. It is pointed out that the distances between the present thanas are great, that the risk of raids from Damanis and other Perso-Baluch tribes makes it necessary to strengthen the posts between Amir Chah and Koh-i-Malik Siah, and chat posts, on the existing scale, are not strong enough to enable regular postal communication to be kept up between Koh-i-Malik Siah and Nushki.

Mt Lord, In your Excellency’s Letter in the Foreign Department, No. 14, Secret, dated the 27th January 1897, you report the arrangements that have been made for the political control and protection of the desert tract between Nushki and the Persian border. 2. I learn that the Khan of Kalat has agreed to relinquish his claim to any share in the tolls hitherto collected at Nushki and that the Zagar Min gal Sardar has agreed to discontinue the tolls entirely, in consideration of a payment of Rs. 7,000 a year, out of which Rs. 3,400 will be an allowance for himself, while the balance will defray the cost of a Mingal levy post at Nushki. 3. The whole of the road from Quetta to Koh-i- Malik Siah will be under the control of the British Government, and free of tolls. 4. These arrangements, which should tend to the development of trade between Baluchistan and Persia, have my approval. I shall await with interest the further information promised in the last paragraph of your Letter, and shall be glad to learn what steps you take towards making a road from Quetta to Nushki. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) George Hamilton.No. 9086, dated Quetta, the 15th December 1896. ! r ° ra - H ; S * BAllNES, EsC1 *’ A ^ ent t0 tbe Governor-General in Baluchistan, o The Secretary to the Government of India; Foreign Department. dated 1 the receipt of your letter No. 2961F. 4.1 r ,. , ctober 18J6, on the subject of the arrangements to be made Koh hMalik C Siah! n and proteCtiori of th ? kafila route fr om Nushki to 2 ‘ A ^ r - Wep ; ) Ware, the officer appointed for the control of the road assumed charge ot his duties as directed on the 15th November, and I have lost no time m discussing with him the details of the arrangements to be made Although the sum allotted by the Government of India for the entertainment of the necessary establishments, viz., Es. 28,200 (per annum) is small, I find for so long a line of road as that from tbe Nushki frontier to the Persian border, it will, I think, be sufficient at any rate for the present and as a begin- mng. It is, however, only sufficient for the pay and contingent expenses of the establishments to be entertained, and I have been compelled in my telegram No. 447, dated tbe 24th November 1896. marked in the margin to ask for a further „ . grant of Rs. 6,500 to cover the initial expenditure required for starting the scheme. This request was sanctioned in your telegram No. 134 of the 2nd instant, and Mr. Webb Ware is now engaged in purchasing the necessary riding camels and equipment. I hope that he will start for Nushki before the end of this month. 3. In paragraph 2 of the letter under reply, it is stated that a special grant, at the rate of Rs. 28,200 a year, or Rs. 2,350 a month, will be sanctioned for the unexpired portion of the year, i.e., from the 15th November to the 31st March. Of the monthly grant, a sum of about Rs. 2,250 will ultimately be absorbed in the pay of establishments, whose pay for March will he drawn after the 1st April, and about Rs. 100 a month will be for contingent expenditure. I therefore calculate that the grant at my disposal for the remainder of the year is Rs. 8,325*. Under the authority given in your letter, I am sanctioning Lieutenant Webb Ware’s office establish ment, and also a small force of 3 or 4 native officers and 25 sowars who will he enlisted in Quetta and who, with 10 sepoys from one of the native regiments in Quetta, will form Lieutenant Webb Ware’s escort across the desert. Lieutenant Webb Ware will be advanced the whole of the grant available up to the end of the year, out of which he will pay his sanctioned establishment monthly and also his contingent and tour expenses. He will also be instructed to entertain, as he goes along within the limits of the grant allotted, the remainder of the levies required for the posts which he will establish at differ ent places on the route. It is not possible to say at present what these posts will consist of, and the details cannot therefore be sanctioned in advance. It is probable that in many places it will be sufficient to entertain local footmen only, with a couple of camel sowars at each post for the purpose of communi cation from one post to another. At Koh-i-Malik Siah Mr. Webb Ware will leave a Munshi with a few sowars. Munshis will also be placed at one or two other places en route, and as he returns Mr. Webb Ware will probably leave a few sowars from his personal escort at each of the principal stations. 'When all the posts are established, complete lists will be sent to me, and provided the monthly grant is not exceeded, a formal proposition statement of all the establishment will be drawn up and sanctioned, and a copy sent to the Government of India for information. This appears to me to be the only satisfactory way in which, under the special circumstances of the case, the necessary arrangements can be made at such a distance from the neaiest treasury; All Mr. Webb Ware’s bills both for establishment and contingencies will come through my office for examination and countersignature, and he will not be permitted to exceed the sanctioned grant. Owing to the nature of the country and the scantiness of the establishment available, the levy posts will necessarily be very far apart, but I think that with good management they should prove sufficient for the purpose for which they are entertained. * Hs. 2,250 x = „ 100 x 4 5 = Total Rs. 7,875 450 8,3254. The crant for initial expenditure will be mostly spent before Mr. Webb Ware starts. Any balance will be advanced to him for the construction of levy huts or shelters en route and the purchase of supplies at Nushki, and the advance will be adjusted by detailed bills sent through my office and counter signed by me. Considerable preparations and much forethought and care are necessary in arranging for the march of even so small a party as 40 men across the 400 miles, which intervene between bJushki and the Persian border. The country is mostly desert and uninhabited; no supplies of any kind are obtain able at present en route, and the marches between the wells are very long. The grant will be spent with the utmost economy, but I think the whole of it will be required. 5. I now come to the recommendations which, as invited in paragraph 4 of your letter, I have to make for the protection of the caravan road through the Khan’s district of Nushki, and for the regulation of the dues hitherto collected at Nushki by the Khan and the Zagar Mingal Sardar. An accurate description of the Nushki district, of the extent of the Khan’s control over it, of the amount of the dues collected, and their injurious effect on the Nushki trade is given in j)aragraph 13 of Captain McMahon’s report of the 21st June 1896. I have nothing to add to Captain McMahon’s remarks, except that the amount of the dues collected varies very considerably from year to year, and that so far as I can ascertain the total sum collected both by the Khan and the Mingals, including a special tax over and above the dues of four annas per loaded camel, which has always been collected by the Mingal Sardar, has probably amounted to from Es. 10,000 to Rs. 12,000 a year. Shortly after my arrival here the Khan of Kalat came to see me in Quetta, and I took advantage of the opportunity _ to send also for the Zagar Mingal Sardar Muhammad Ali Khan, so that, if possible, a satisfactory arrangement re 0,, ardin o ' these dues might be made without further loss of time. copy of Sir Robert Sandeman’s letter to the PoliS^ fn^a^hh^n ?,! 890 ^ 0 WhiC ' 1 ref ™ is V Captelf McvS that S in 13 f K his Memorandum, and m which it is distinctly laid down Annendix^^^-wil 1 ^ a V las t0 ^ shares iQ the ^ushkf dues.

Subsequently I bad an interview with the Mingal Sardar and called on him also to give, assistance m the matter of the road. I pointed out that he could not be permitted to levy dues at rates higher than those authorised bv Sir Kobeit Sandeman, and that m order to prevent complaints and exactions, it was bel ter that the dues should be collected by the Government and the proceeds paid to him. In the end, after much discussion, the Sardar agreed to this proposal He also agreed that only half the net proceeds of our collection should be paid to him, and that the other half (the so-called Khan’s share) might be used by Government in maintaining posts on the road. Finally, in the event of. Government proposing to buy up the dues altogether, he agreed to relinquish his claims entirely for the payment of Rs. 7,000 a year, out of which Rs. 3,400 would be paid as an allowance to himself and Rs. 3,600 in the main tenance of a Mingal levy post at Nushki of the strength* shown in the margin. The Sardar’s agreement is contained in his letter to me of the 27th November, of which a copy and translation are attached (Appeudix 1)). 8. In accordance with this agreement, and pending the orders of Govern ment on this report, I am instructing Lieutenant Webb Ware to appoint a Munshi at Nushki with a few sowars for the collection of dues in accordance ■with the rates fixed by Sir Robert Sandeman, and to keep for the present an account of the proceeds received. This will at any rate prevent the irregular and excessive exactions by which the Khan’s contractor and the Mingal Sardar have been in the habit of worrying the traders, and will enable some method to be introduced into the system of collection. At the same time it must be confessed that it will not be easy to supervise even a Government Munshi at a place like N ushki, and to ensure that we receive all he collects, for Mr. Webb Ware himself will be away in the desert all through the cold weather. I would therefore strongly recommend that, in accordance with the policy adopted elsewhere, the Government of India should adopt the alternative agreed to by the Mingal Sardar, and buy up the Nushki dues once for all for the very moderate sum of Rs. 7,000 a year. The knowledge that all dues have been done away with will be a great incentive to the traders to make use of this route, and to bring grain into Quetta from Seistan, and will do more than anything else to make the route a popular one. The amount too, Rs. 7,000, is, I think, most moderate, and much less than I expected we should have to pay when I commenced these negotiations. Captain McMahon considered that in 1895 the dues realised amounted,. including the Khan’s share, to Rs. 15,000. This no doubt was an outside estimate, and the amount collected must necessarily have been subject to great fluctuations. But including bis Sardari tax (over and above the dues) of 4 annas a camel load, the Mingal Sardar must often have received as much as. Rs. /,000 m a year. We cannot abolish the taxes without compensation, and it may be more difficult to buy them up later on if in the meantime the trade and the income from the Total Rs. 50 70 180 300 p in.of Ks. 7,000 was only arrived at after prolonged argu- it should be brought into force from the 1st January, so that the tolls may be at once abolished, and the levies engaged and placed in position by Mr. Webb Ware during his winter tour. The result will be that the whole of the road from Quetta to Koh-i-Malik Siah will be under the control of the British Government and free of tolls, and with the aid of the levies maintained out of the compensation, and with the Zagar Mingal Chief in receipt of a fixed allowance, it should be easy for the officer in charge to maintain order in the Nushki district, and to put an end to the scandals described in paragraph 4 of Captain McMahon’s Memorandum.

As these arrangements are now being made, I think it proper to bring to your kind notice that the ‘ 6 Sung ” of Nushki is divided equally between myself and the Khan of Kalat. I have now heard that His Highness the Khan has given up his share of the “ Sung ” (to the British Government). Now it is better and suitable that a Munshi should be appointed in Nushki by the British Government, who will collect “ Sung ” in accordance with old custom and according to the directions of the late Sir Bobert Sandeman. The pay of the Munshi and other expenses incurred in connection with the recovery of the “ Sung ” may be deducted from the gross receipts J (one-half) of the remaining sum which is my share should be paid to me. Hereby I give my consent to the above pro posal. I further agree to give any assistance, that may be required of me, to the Munshi in the recovery of the “ Sung.” If the British Government decide hereafter to abolish “ Sung,” as this is my only means of living ahd I am unable to give up my share, I will agree to the proposal, provided that I receive Rs. 7,000 per annum in exchange for my rights. Out of this Rs. 7,000, a sum of Rs. 3,400 should be paid to me alone, and I will give the rest, i.e., Rs. 3,600 per annum, to the British Govern ment on account of the pay of the following establishment : — One Jemadar, @ Rs. 50 per mensem ... Two Munshis or Duffadars, @ Rs. 35 each Nine Sowars, @ Rs 20 per mensem each Us. 600 840 2,160 Total ... 3,600 That is to say, Rs. 300 per mensem, or Rs. 3,600 a year. These men should be engaged through me, and I will be in every way responsible for the protection of the trade route and kafllas within Nushki and withm the country of my tribe. I will then relinquish all claims to ‘Sung ” and transit dues.wi U lead o/merTS^nd tion of the route, &amp;c., is concerned. 'Witness— Sardar Yar Muhammad, Kurd.

Control of tract and trade routes between Nushki and Seistan. With your Excellency’s Letter in the Foreign Department (Secret, Frontier), dated the 16th September 1896, No. 170, you enclose a Memorandum by Captain McMahon, C.I.E., late British Commissioner with the Afghan-Baluch Boundary Commission, on the country between Nushki and Persia, which, owing to the recent demarcation, has come within the British sphere of influence. In this Memorandum Captain McMahon submits proposals for the management and admini stration of the tract and for the protection of the trade routes by which it is traversed. 2. These proposals are summarized in the loth paragraph of his Memorandum. 3. You state that his suggestion to replace Kalat control in the Nushki district by direct British administration will be referred for the consideration of the Governor General’s Agent in Baluchistan, and I shall await the report which you propose to submit later on this question. 4. With regard to the control to be exercised in the Sinjerani country, which extends from Nushki to the Persian border between Kharan on the one side and the new Afghan boundary on the other, you explain in paragraph 3 of your Letter that the claims of Sardar Sir Naoroz Khan of Kharan to the Chageh district are not tenable, and that by virtue of the Kabul Agreement of 1893 you are at liberty to exercise in it such control as you may think necessary. 5. You further state that the chief value of this country lies in the trade route which crosses it, and which will form the easiest and most direct line of communication between Quetta. and . Eastern Persia. There are reasons for anticipating that, with proper encouragement, a large and lucrative trade will spring up between Seistan and Quetta, S. 53.i 1 * 4 - /'if irrmrovin 0 * tllG Ccir^'Vclll and, with the ohjec whkhn vou consider routes between Persia and Ba ^chistan you c that it would be worth while to incur so penditure m proteennS ’ h district under a political control of the Uia p j ii o r i n ffi„ er and by maintaining levy posts aim g tti oad fo guard it Lm Afghan incursions on h one side and on the other from the exactions which the Nao’sherwanis of Kharan will to levy upon it, unless British author.ty . P sented throughout its whole length. 6. You explain that to secure adequate protection, the whole of the road from Nushki to the Peisian border, and the political arrangements in the country through which it passes, should be placed under a British officer, and this can only be done by adding a Political Assistant to the staid ot the frovomor General s Assent in Baluchistan. 7. The total cost of these arrangements is estimated to amount to about Bs. 24,550 a year.. This outlay includes an increased allowance ol Bs. 350 a month to Sardar Ali Khan, Sinjerani, who has been re-instated in Chageh, from which he was expelled hy the Afghans in 1886. In return for this increased allowance he would he expected to maintain a few levies for the protection of the frontier beyond Chageh and towards the Helmand. 8. Por the opening up and maintenance of this important trade route, and for the protection of the newly demarcated frontier, you ask sanction to the addition of a Political Assistant of the 3rd Class to your Excellency’s Political Department, and to the other charges named, within the total indicated. Your Excellency is of opinion that the control of this new tract of country cannot be effectually exercised in any other way or at a smaller cost, hut if yon are permitted to incur the ex penditure you have named, yon think that it will he possible not only to ensure the protection of the kafila route, but also to establish peace and order along the whole of this portion of the Afghan border. 9. A perusal of Captain McMahon’s report has led me to concur in the opinion which your Excel lency’s Government have formed, that the effective control of this country could not he exercised otherwise than by the agency which yon have suggested. Further, the time appears to me to be exceptionally favourable for encouraging traders to make use of this route between India and Eastern Persia. I understand that the transit trade between these countries via Afghanistan has almost ceased, m consequence of the crushing imposts levied on caravans by the Afghan Government, and that the Afghan traders are eager to take advantage of this new route.w®' In T t ,¥ mterests, therefore, of the trade en India and Persia, it seems to me to he very desirable to further its development by this rou this object I sanction the measures proposed by your Excellency for controlling the district and protecting the route. 11. A telegram to this effect was despatched to your Excellency on the 21st October 1896. 12. As an increase of the area under cultivation is expected to follow on the establishment of British control in this tract, I shall be glad to learn in due time whether it has been found possible to assess a light revenue, and thus lessen the cost of the establishments maintained there.

My Lord, We have the honour to forward, for Your Lordship’s inform ation, a copy of a letter* from Captain ^ No. 314, dated the 22nd June 1896« hi/t n/r i t th i • i McManon, C.I.E. 5 recently the British Commissioner with the Afghan-Baluch Boundary Commission, enclosing a memorandum on the country between Nushki and Persia, which, owing to the demarcation of the Afghan-Baluch Boundary, has come within the British sphere of influence. 2. It is satisfactory to learn from Captain McMahon’s report that the delimitation of the southern boundary of Afghanistan has not involved the surrender of any important trade routes between Baluchistan and Persia, and that excluding the route along the Helmand, the only caravan road of any value between Nushki and Seistan has been left on the British side of the border. This road at the end nearest Quetta passes from the British district of Shorarud through the Kalat district of Nushki, and thence through the Chageh dis trict, which is inhabited by the Sinjerani-Baluchis, to the Koh-i-Malik Siah. The delimitation of the Perso-Baluch frontier from Talk to Koh-i-Malik Siah, and of the Afghan-Baluch border from the Sarlat range of hills to the same place has left the whole of the Chageh district within the British sphere of influence, and the question raised by Captain McMahon is how our political control in this country can best be exercised so as to ensure the protection of the trade route, and the due observance of the boundaries now laid down. 3. We do not propose at present to offer any suggestions as to Captain McMahon’s proposals in regard to the Nushki district. Nushki is Kalat territory, and any arrangements for the improvement of its administration, or for the regulation or abolition of the tolls now levied by the Zagar Mmgals and the Khan, or for the abolition of the traffic in slaves, to which Captain McMahon alludes, must necessarily in the first place be discussed with the Rhan of Kalat. We propose to commend those portions of Captain McMahon sr [ 2 ] report which deal with these matters, to the careful attention of our Agent “ Baluchistan, and we anticipate that with ks ass^tance there should he no difficulty in an-iving at a satisfactory understanding with the Khan on the subiect This is a matter on which we propose to report later. There remains the question of the control to he exercised in the Sinjeram country, which extends in a long strip from Nushki to the Persian border, between Kharan on the one side and the new Afghan boundary on the other. Sardar Sir Nauroz Khan of Kharan has always advanced claims to this country based upon the authority exercised by his father, Azad Khan, when, as a semi-independent Chief, he was in the habit of raiding impartially the borders of Kalat and Persia and Afghanistan, and of declaring himself a subject of each State in turn as suited his convenience. But Sir Nauroz Khan is now a member of the Baluch Confederacy in subordination to the Khan of Kalat, and his claims to the Chageh district are not in our opinion deserving of consideration. They are not recognised by the people of the district, and they were not admitted by the Afghans, who until quite recently maintained levy posts along the Kharan border at Panihan, Zaian, and other places along the southern edge of Dalbandin, and levied land revenue from all the cultivation in the country. By virtue of the Kabul Agreement of 1893, and as part of the consideration for the additional six lakhs which we pay under that agreement to the Amir, we have recovered this district from the Afghans, and we are at liberty to exercise in it such direct control as we may think necessary or desirable. 4. We do not altogether share Captain McMahon’s rather roseate antici pations of the way in which this country can be developed. Most of it is desert, and the population is very sparse, and nomadic rather than agricultural. The chief value of the country lies in the trade route by which it is traversed—a route which is likely to be of much prospective importance, as it will form the easiest and most direct line of communication between Quetta and Eastern Persia. It will be seen from Captain McMahon’s report that the Ghilzais, whose carrying trade between Ghazni and India has been killed by the Amir’s fiscal policy, are eager to take advantage of this new opening, and as the road is easy, and the whole of it to the Persian border within two or three marches of Seistan v ill be under our control, it is highly probable that with proper encomagement a large and lucrative trade will spring up between Seistan and Quetta. Owing to the want of a market, wheat in Seistan is said to be selling at two Indian maunds for the rupee. The return trade will probably consist ar &amp; e y o piece goods which, it is likely, will be supplied to this part of Persia more cheaply from Quetta than from elsewhere.

Nothing in the shape of Af.hans P and W the nIoT^ ^ “ they are P rotected ^ the Afghans and the Naosherwams, would he left to manage their own affairs subject to the advme of the Political Officer. Since 1886 when Sardar Ali Kh n Smjeram, was forcffily turned out of Chageh by the Afghans, we have paid S Chief a subsistence allowance of Ps. 10 a day. Sardar Ali Khan has now been emstated m Chageh, but, as it is important to utiUse his services on the border, we propose to raise his allowance to Rs. 350 a month, and to continue it as a service allowance m return for which he will be expected to maintain a few levies for he protection of the frontier beyond Chageh and towards the Helmand. But i we are to give the people the protection they require, the whole of the road from Nushki to the Persian border, and the political arrangements in the country through which it passes, should be placed under a British officer, and this can only be done by adding a Political Assistant to the staff of the Governor- General s Agent in Baluchistan. It would be necessary to give this officer a small office establishment, and also to place at his disposal, as suggested by Captain McMahon, a body of 50 Political Assistant, 3rd Class, Rs. 500 per mensem Fifty camel sowars at Rs. 20 each per mensem Native officers for these levies, say Rs. 250 per mensem...

The total cost of these arrange ments would, as shown in the margin, amount to about Es. ' 28,200 a year. The net increase of expenditure, if the allowance hitherto paid to Ali Khan is taken into account, would be Es. 24,550. If Your Lordship is of opinion that the opening up and maintenance of this important trade route, and the protec tion of the newly demarcated frontier is worth this expenditure, we would ask sanction to the addition of a Political Assistant of the 3rd class to our Political Department, and for permission to incur the other charges named within the total indicated. 'We are of opinion that the control of this new tract of country cannot be effectually exercised in any other way or at a smaller cost, but if we are permitted to incur the expenditure we have named, we think that it will be possible not only to ensure the protection of the kafila route, but also to establish peace and order along the whole of this portion of the Afghan border. One result of the peace that will be established will be certainly a considerable increase in the cultivation of tracts like Dalbandin, which are suitable for agricultural operations. This will mean greater facilities for the passage of caravans, and if it should be found desirable to take such a course, it is probable that some portion of the expenditure might be recovered by the levy of a light revenue in those parts of the country where the Afghans have hitherto been collecting one-half the gross produce. The levy establishment placed at the disj&gt;osal of the Political Officer would enable him to collect such revenue as is available at present, and we do not propose to incur any further expense on establishments, unless the Political Officer can show that he can meet the expenditure from his collections.a A.

I attach a map which will show, at a glance, the general features of General sketch map attached. ^ le . cou ntry, and the positions of the various places named below. 3. The country under consideration consists of two portions i.e., the Nushki Country consists of two portions. anc ^ Chagai districts. 4 . The Nushki district comprises the plain country south of the boundary The Nushki district. line from the Sarlat range to Kam. On , , . , t ^ e west ^ extends to Kani and Muhabbat and on the south to the Kharan border, which is now the watershed of the mountain of the Sheikh Hussain Raskoh which extends along the south of the Nushki, Chagai, and Dalbandin plains. The Sarlat and other continuous moun tain ranges bound it on the east. This tract is inhabited by the Rakhshanis and Zagar Mingals. The former are the original owners of the whole country, while the latter migrated to this coun try from further south, many generations ago, owing to feuds with the rest of the Mingal tribe.. They now both own large tracts of cultivation south of the bound ary line and in the neighbourhood of Nushki. Their country, which it will be seen is one large level plain, comprises immense tracts of good culturable lands. These, now that peace and security are about to be established in the country, will no doubt ere long be brought under cultivation, and the total area of cultiva tion should be in time a very large one. The present condition of Nushki is far from satisfactory. Although irr reality it belongs to the Kalat State, the Khan of Kalat has exercised no authority whatever in the country, and his only connection with the place appears to be his recent acquisition of a share in the Nushki customs duties, which will be referred to hereafter. Although, moreover, nominally under our control, w’e have exercised little or no authority in Nushki. In November 1891 w r e sent a political moonshi and a few levies there, but subsequently, in March 1892, withdrew them; and 50 in June 1895 we again sent a Levy es tablishment there of the strength shown in the margin to prevent raids which were then being made by the Barechi Afghans into Nushki, and which were being encour- the Rakhshanis to spite the other section with whom they w^ere on bad terms. Beyond this step we have never taken any measures to exercise control in this country, and the results of our inaction are very appa rent. The Rakhshani and Zagar Mmgal chiefs and the various headmen of the mam sections of the Rakhshanis are all at feud with each other. This does not lead to the same amount of bloodshed as it would do elsewhere, for the present want of spirit and energy among these people keeps them from taking such forcible action. Their ill-feeling spends itself in petty intrigue and spite which has paralyzed their powers of independent action and reduced this pleasing community to the condition of a set of miserable village curs, who snarl and growl at each other without daring to fight. They unite only to bully the weaker kafilas that pass through Nushki. The stronger kafilas are generally left severely alone. The authority of the tribal chiefs over their tribes as might be expected under the circumstances, has been reduced to almost nil. Powerless as enemies and useless as friends, their present condition renders them likely to be a source of future trouble on our border unless mea sures are taken to remedy the present state of affairs and estabhsh sirfficent authority there to prevent irresponsible tribesmen from causing trouble on he Afghan border. At present this country is neither under British nor Kalat cont o , 1 Jemadar @ Rs. 50 per n ensem. 1 Moonshi @ „ 30 ,, 1 Duffadar@ ,, 30 ,, 9 Sowars @ ,, 20 ,, Contingent allowance @ Rs. 10 Total aged by one section of 30 30 300 per mensem.and the dealings of many of the tribesmen have been with Afghanistan. Owing to the want of a central authority and the apathy and 'want of influence, of their chiefs, they have been reduced, in many instances, to referring their disputes to Afghan officials for settlement. As an instance of their connection with Afghan officials I should note that most of the Zagar Mingal headmen we met along the southern fringe of Registan use to go first to the Afghan Commissioner and used then to be sent on to me by him. It is obviously necessary that this state of things should be put an end to. There is yet another important reason for establishing effective control in this place, and that is with a view to stopping the trade which at present goes on there in Hazara and other slaves, male and female. These are smuggled across the Afghan border to Nushki and thence sent to purchasers throughout Baluchistan. The Amir’s officials in Shorawak have endeavoured to put a stop to this, and on one occasion within the past two or three years endeavoured to station a small outpost at Nushki with that object. 5.

This and subject tribe, the Paokis, who are known . . r ,, , • r , as Sanjaranis, tra ct forms the present territory of the Chagai Sanjaranisf. I have already given a brief history and genealogy of the Sanjarani tribe in appendix vii of my final report on the demarcation of the boundary line. Suffice here to say that the Chagai Sanjaranis are a branch of the Sanjarani tribe whose original home was Chagai and of which the three other branches reside in Seistan, Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, Chahar Burjak and Chakan Sur on the Helmand respectively. The history of this tribe shows that from early times they have had no direct connection with either Kalat or Kharan. All their dealings have been with Afghanistan. The Afghans have always considered them Afghan subjects and when, in 1884, the Armr learnt, m connection with the march of the Afghan Boundary Commission to trie Helmand, that we considered Chagai ours he forthwith sent an Afghan gar rison to occupy the place. These have been in possesion from 1886 to the pre- senttmie Afghan occupation _ extended not only to Chagai itself but over the w ole extent of the Chagai district.

Our combined camps amounting to some 1,200 men and over i,ooo camels may be taken as an instance of a small but heavily equipped force passing through the country without any previous local arrangements whatsoever, and that at an advanced season of the year after a period of nearly two years’ drought. The high mountain range north-west of it is inaccessible and quite impassable except by mountaineers between the Shibian and Mazari passes. The plains of fertile land east and south of it should render it possible in the near future to feed a fairly large force here entirely on local supplies. There is abundant and excellent water at many places in the near neighbourhood of Chagai; facts which it would be well to remember, either in relation to ourselves or an enemy. A glance at the relative position of Chagai with regard to other places will I think show what an important part it might play in the flank defence of any line which depended at all on the strength of either Kandahar, or Quetta, or both against an enemy from the north or north-west. The late General Sir Charles Macgregor, Quarter Master General, used to lay great stress on the stra tegic importance of Kharan. He called it the “ Key of Baluchistan,” vide his “Wanderings in Baluchistan.” I feel confident that, if he had, personally knownlthe geographical circumstances of Chagai and its neighbourhood, a tract which had not then been surveyed or properly explored, he would have applied his remark, with still greater emphasis, to Chagai. Chagai effectively^covers Kharan. The Amir has always been very anxious to retain Chagai and he vehemently protested against its being included within British territory when, that portion of the boundary line was under consideration during the Durand Mission to Cabul, in 1893. He used to tell Sardar Muhammad Umar Khan, my late Afghan colleague, that he considered Chagai the key not only of southern Balu chistan but also of the Helmand valley. It is very important from a military point of view that we should now take advantage of our opportunities, and extend our influence over this tract, to the extent at least of making an easy line of communication with Chagai, ready forand of encouraging the dCTe ' 0 P n ® '‘fevents may oblige us to move forward maintenance of any force wh ^ those who y maintai that the country is a to Chagai.

It fs wi e therefore to accept the inevitable and include the development of the country in our other calculations connected with the defence of the frontier. n As regards (2) the opening up and protection of trade between Persia 9 ’ W F an d India. This is an important question Opening up of Persian trade with India. an( j a E pttle consideration will show that it is really one of Imperial interest. Seistan and Meshed are centres of a large trade, which as far as India is concerned, has been of late years , owing to Afghan taxation, closed to the Indian markets, except, m so far as communication by sea via the Persian Gulf, has allowed it being carried on. The Indian Merchants resident in Meshed have of late years, I understand, bitterly complain- ed of the falling off of their trade with India, owing to^ the heavy customs dues levied by the Afghans on all the direct routes that trade would naturally follow. As a case in point and one which intimately concerns the Indian Military authorities, let us take the trade m Persian horses from Meshed, w r hich at one time appeared to offer very promising prospects in the matter of supplying good, and cheap remounts for native cavalry. This trade is now absolutely closed. The taxes levied on each horse brought from Meshed amounts, by the time Chaman is reached, to no less than 15^ Cabul rupees. This amount, added to the cost price of the horse, raises the sale price of the animal above the amount purchasers are willing to give. Moreover traders complained that it was useless bringing any but mediocre animals to India, as any of more than ordinary merit were seized for little or no payment by the chiefs and headmen of Afghan towms en route. Whether traders travelled by the more direct routes through Afghanistan proper and came via Khwaja Ali or Kandahar ; or whether they made a wide detour South of the Helmand via Panihan, Galichah and other similar routes, the results were the same. In the latter case they fell into the hands of the Amir’s customs collectors either at Isa Tahir, Panih^n, Galichah, Scrap or Dalbandin. The effect on trade has been disastrous. Now, however, the demarcation of the Indo-Afghan boundary line to Persia has altered the whole aspect of the case. The Afghan customs outposts have been withdrawn from Panihan and Galichah and all other places South of our boundary line and their routes are therefore now open to free trade. It has been maintained by various authorities that the main trade route from Seistan follows the Shelag river bed across. Afghan territory to Godar-i-Shah and thence across to Amir Chah. . This theory was opposed to all 1 had ever learnt from Seistan traders who said the main route ran just west of the Koh-i-Malik Siah. When I recently visited Godar-i-Shah and Gumbaz-i-Shah, I found no signs of any frequented trade route there. Moreover from that place to Amir Chah is a distance of 85 miies without a drop of water on the road. This fact in itself would go far to piove tnat this route . cannot be extensively used. When, however, we reached the Koh-i-Malik Siah, we found a large kafila road, immediately jp j !£ ^' es t °I the Koh-i-Malik Siah, which passes by the Koh-i-Malik Sian Ziarat. This route was evidently most extensively used, as proved most undisputedly by the number of well worn camel tracks.. The octular and nasal evidence of the frequent offerings of sheep and goats, made at the Koh-i-Malik Siah Ziarat, by passing kafilas, gave every corroboration which the existence of i re road itseff and the statements of the natives of the country might require.Kafilas by this route, which comes bv ea^v anrl woii « j i . can now turn off eastwards md the upper Robat (Sar Ro^at' StagGS Seistari&lt; ^ the route traversed by the Mission^vitLut ent^nfAfg^n'S^ aHt 66 ' they can diverge from the above kafik route at Duzdap, orstill further sou hind' travel OTa Amalaf and the various other easier routes which, passing either through Amir Chah or Mushkija converge on Nushki via Isa Tahir, Panihan, Sorap and Dal ban din. The taxes levied by the Kharan Chief would prevent heir taking routes further south than the above. 1 taking Seistan traders have often told me that, once the demarcation of the Afo-han boundary enabled them to use routes from Persia through British territory they would extensively use the above named routes. There are already indications of an approaching revival on a very large scale, of trade between Persia and India through Nushki. While at the Koh-i-mahk Siah we heard of a large kafda awaiting in Seistan the completion oi demarcation work to start for India. This has by now probably reached Nushki. The Ghilzai and other Powindah headmen, who have accompa nied me with their camels throughout the Mission from the Gomal to Persia assure me that they are prepared to take every advantage of this new trade route! I have known these men for years. Some of them, in old days, carried on a very large carrying trade between Ghazni and India, but the Amir’s increased customs taxes have gradually di minished that trade until it has now practically died out altogether. These men, like thousands of ethers, have lost their old lucrative occu pation and are reduced to grazing flocks, instead of bringing large laden katilas yearly up and down the Gomal. They now say they are about to turn their atten tion to the Persian trade, and transfer their camels from the Gomal to Quetta and Peshin. So much struck are they with the prospects of this new trade, that a party of my camel owners, Kharoti Ghilzais, are actually now at this most unfavourable season of the year on their way back with their camels laden with merchandize to Seistan. Others are about to start at the end of the summer, and their example will be followed no doubt by large numbers of other Powindahs. I feel confident that the development of our trade with Persia will soon bring itself to very general notice. Every encouragement should be given to it and every precaution taken to prevent obstacles being allowed to be put in the way at the outset, thereby endangering and delaying the rapid development which circumstances justify our reasonably expecting. As I will endeavour to explain below, the obstacle pre sented by the customs taxes at Nushki must be removed. 10. As regards (3) the opening up of more direct relations with Seistan, the settlement of a definite boundary line and Opening up of more direct relations with Setstan. ^ necess - ty for protecting the trade route from Seistan to Nushki, give us a good opportunity of effecting this desirable ob ject, without necessarily attracting much notice. I need not dwell at greater length on this point here as it is obvious that we ought to be in more direct communication with, and obtain more direct information concerning, a country which is probably destined to play an important part in our future frontier policy and to which Russia has for some time past paid very special attention. I hope, in connection with the other measures which I am about to suggest for the better po itica con trol of our frontier and the efficient protection of trade routes, to suggest means by which this last object can also be effected. 11. The above remarks have sketched the main objects to be aimed at m , . ., i the measures which the recent ooundary Measures suggested for adoption with regard n non mke and to the country south Of the boundary hne. settlement now calls upon us to take ana it remains to be considered what measures are required to attain ^ose objec s ,, .1,1 ttlie first the Cfi.g.i “ « i.r j™ Measures suggested with regard to the Ar v possession.

On the other hand the Chagai Sanjarani Chief has good grounds for claiming Hurmagai and other places south of the mountain range which forms their present boundary which were originally Sanjarani territory. We are now called upon to take this district under our direct administra tion. The Chief, Sardar Ali Khan, naturally a weak man, has been a r efu gee from his country for years and is wanting in personal influence over his tribe. . lo leave him alone to look after this large tract of country, would be to abandon it to anarchy, to encourage wholesale encroachments by Kharan on the south and Afghans on the north, and effectively close the new Persian trade route to Nushki. It is necessary, I think under the circumstances, to place a permanent official at Chagai with a small levy and revenue establishment. It would suffice at present to establish a Tahsil there under a selected native Tahsildar. The establishment need at first be but a small one as the revenue work would be light. . The levy establishment also need not be a large one. The Sanjaranis are a very quiet inoffen sive tribe and much more likely to welcome than resent our interference in their country. They are at present very grateful to us for relieving them from Afghan op pression, and their cultivators assured me that if we allow them to retain their lands they are willing to pay us the same revenue they paid to the Amir, i.e.&gt; half their produce. The tribe know that they have flow come under our rule and they have been led to expect to be brought under our direct control and to be made to pay Government revenue. No difficulty need be anticipated in administering the Chagai district as an ordinary Tahsil. The area of the country is large, but the^popula- tion is extremely sparce and a few levies will be quite sufficient to keep the whole country in order. The chief, though a weak man, is well disposed towards us, and, with the support of a Government official at his back, would no doubt be able to regain influenc over his tribe.—Experience has shown in Zhob and elsewhere, that very large areas of country can be satisfactorily worked by one Tahsil estab lishment, and I do not think any difficulty need be anticipated here. The Tahsil would naturally be added to the Quetta and Peshin District. If the services of an additional Assistant Political Agent are given to Baluchistan that officer would be advantageously employed in the cold weather in visiting and inspecting this country, But little encouragement would be required to bring the extensive tracts of culturableland in the Chagai and Dalbandm plains under cultivation, and there is every likelihood of the Chagai District becoming, in the near future, a remunerative acquisition, Land revenue, at the rates usual in Baluchistan, should be levied As before mentioned the Afghans have hitherto levied half the produce The head-quarters of the Chagai district should at first beat Chagai itself, where made° rt ^° VdS r0Ugh but sufficient accommodation until other arrangements are It would then remain to be decided whether Chagai or Liiji Karez or some place higher up m the neighbouring hills, where the summer heat is less severe, should be selected as the permanent head-quarters of the Tahsil. , , The 'J^hs'idar. hke others in Baluchistan, should be vested with political authority, and exercise political control over the whole area of the Chaeai district and up to the Persian border. Owing to the all but uninhabited state of the country westwards, this is not such a difficult matter as the area of the tract would lead one to suppose.

J In connection with the better protection of the Persian trade routes it is necessary, I consider, to station, during the cold-weather months, an intelligent man with a few levy sowars at the upper Robat spring, near the -Koh-i-Malik Siah. His duty would to prevent, or, failing ability to do so, to report any interference* on the part of the Afghan levies stationed at the lower Robat spring, with kafilas passing just outside the Afghan boundary at that point. This man, who should be carefully selected for the purpose, would, at the Koh-i-Malik Siah, be in a position to learn much that was going on in Seistan and in the neighbouring Persian province. In this manner the first step will have been made to enter into more direct relations with Seistan than has hitherto been possible. Experience would then show what other steps might be possible or desirable from time to time. An intelligent man suitable for this post could doubtless be obtained at a salary of about Rs. 50 per mensem. These men, if it be considered unwise to place them so close to the Afghan post, might be stationed at Kacha, or othet neighbouring place. They are. likely to have ample opportunities of communi cation with Chagai or Nushki, either by passing kafilas, or by sending, if neces sary, one pf their party to the next levy station. 13. The above suggestions deal with the country from Persia to within a XT few miles of Nushki. It remains now to Measures suggested -with regard to Nushki. ^ quest ; on of Nushki its6lfi Here greater difficulty presents itself than elsewhere. Chagai has been shown to be ours, to do with as we like. Nushki, on the other hand, is nominally a portion of the Kalat State. The Khan of Kalat’s control over this district has, it is true, been merely nominal, and his only connection with the place appears to be his share in the customs taxes levied on kafilas at Nushki. Whether we take the district entirely out of the Khan's hands or not, it is, in my opinion, essentially necessary that w 7 e should exercise direct control in that country, and put a stop to the extremely unsatisfactory state of things now prevailing there, as described in paragraph 4 above . Without our direct interference, it is impossible to expect that the Nushki Chiefs will abandon their petty feuds and devote their attention to looking after their tribes and encouraging the cultivation of their extensive lands. It is foolish also to expect that, without our direct interference, the trad, route through Nushki will remain either safe or open. As matters stand now the taxes levied on killing trade altogether. The case stands briefly thus : The Zaga r ^ngal Chief has from old times levied tolls on kafilas passing g Kh an 0 f tolls were originally fairly moderate. y ea F s, /‘^ 11- j s ’ T 0 prevent Kalat, by some private arrangement, acquired ha Minp-al Sardar Muhammad this division diminishing his former income, the Zagar W Ali Khan, largely increased the rate of taxes ^vied according to and imposed new taxes on articles not PF^ OUS o ^ ds# hi s l e tter &amp; to the items established an ad-valorem dut 7 0 March 1800 the late Sir Robert Political Agent, Kalat, No. 1350, dated 3 IS ^ 9 n g W ra tes and ordered Sandeman, Agent to the Gove ^ or ' G 1 ener o , als0 re fused to admit the right of the the tolls to be reduced to the old scale.

Ttot .e should go lo iho touble and expense of settling a boundary line with the Amir, and of demarcating hat line in o P rder to free °the Persian trade route from Afghan taxation, and yet allow the Khan of Kalat and the Zagar Mingal Chief o undo all the good hereby effected, and kill trade by exactions at Nushki, ,s obviously absurd Even to allow them to themselves collect customs dues on a revised scale would be unwise, as, without careful supervision, the present objections would continue to exist. It should be remembered that it is not only the amount of the customs duties, but the highhanded conduct of the customs collectors that is killing the Nushki trade. Three courses are open to us, z.e. } (i) to abolish, by order without compensation, all taxes at Nushki in accordance with the right which, I understand, Government, as shown by precedents elsewhere, appa rently has of doing ; (2) to abolish all taxes and pay the Khan of Kalat and the Zamir Mingal Chief reasonable compensation, and (3) to take over the col lection of customs duties ourselves, fix a reasonable rate, and pay the Khan and Zagar Mingal Chief either a sum representing their average former income, or the balance, or a fixed portion of the balance of the collections after deducting ex penses of collection, and any other charges which might reasonably be set off against that income. The matter is one which demands very early and careful consideration, for, if a revival of trade next cold-weather is checked at the outset,, as it most assuredly under existing circumstances will be by the Nushki dues, it may be thrown back and retarded for many a long day to come. To return to the subject of our direct control of Nushki, I strongly urge the advisability, for many and obvious reasons, of its being brought under our direct administration, and it should be included under the administration of the Chagai Tahsil. The present levy establishment noted in paragraph 4 should be retained there and placed under the charge of the Chagai Tahsildar. Later on, when the development of the country necessitates it, Nushki can be made a Naib- Tahsildar’s charge. Revenue, in my opinion, should be taken from the Rakhshanis, Zagar Mingals and others of the Nushki district. They can fairly be called upon to pay revenue in return for the peace and security now established in their country and the protection now afforded them, by the new boundary line, from the former encroachments and raids of the Barechi Afghans. The boundary line gives them large tracts of valuable land, such as the Bulandwal lands, which, owing to Barechi interference, they have not dared for many years to cultivate. There would be no great difficulty in making the people pay revenue, and I consider it would be a wise and politic act to make them do so, for the more thoroughly we have the tribes on our immediate frontier under effective control, the less chance wdl there be of friction on the border, and the greater use will there be whenever, hereafter, their services in disturbed times may be required. The question of setting aside the merely nominal control of the Khan of Kalat in this tract, and of adjusting the revenue rights of the Rakshani and Zagar Mingal. Chiefs to meet the requirements of Government revenue assessment without injustice to those Chiefs, is one which must be considered by the Baluchis- Bia*' it #® 15 It F 11 ' 1 neisf 0$ „.,ra a ri 1 local 0 14. c Necessity 0 track is a cuttings, 1 te closed sitjforit itself and b* Tlie establish] gression f aoiprote anl( 5 )t objects otiU onth9 tan authorities. The matter is not, I think, in reality, one o{ much difficulty If revenue is taken from these tribes, moderate allowances for tribal service should be granted to the chiefs and principal headmen. Whether Government reve nue is or is not taken in the Nushki tract, it in no way affects the question of taking Government^ revenue in the Chagai District. Government rights to revenue there are indisputable, and the country generally may be treated as a “ tabula rasa ” on which Government has now the opportunity of inscribing with a free hand,_ any measures of administration it may wish, without infring ing local or tribal rights. s 14. Before concluding these suggestions I should note the advisability Necessity for making a good road to Nushki from on every ground of making a good road Quetta ' . _ from Quetta to Nushki. The present camel track is a very bad one, often very steep and sometimes passing through narrow cuttings, which, in winter, are often closed by snow. A road would seldom if ever be closed hy snow, and the.advantage to kafilas would be immense. The neces sity for it is obvious in the interests of Government administration of the country itself and in those of trade especially. 15. To sum up;—the objects to be aimed at in our dealings with the c country south of the boundary line from S “ mmary - the Sarlat to Persia are :— The institution of direct dealings with the country in question in order (1) to establish peace and security ; (2) to prevent future frontier troubles either from ag gression from without or aggression from within; (3) to enable us, at a future time, to make the best use of the important strategic position of Chagai; (4) to open up and protect what promises to be a very extensive trade between India and Persia and (5) to open up more direct relations with and acquire better information con cerning Seistan and the neighbouring Persian frontier provinces. To attain these objects the following measures are suggested.— (1) the construction of a good road from Quetta to Nushki; (2) the supersession of the merely nominal control of Kalat in the Nushki district by direct British administration; (3) the institution of direct British administration in the Chagai District z.e., from the Nushki border to Persia; (4) the formation in connection with (2) and (3) above of a regular Tahsil at Chagai to administer both the Nushki and Chagai Districts. The Tahsil to be added to the Quetta Pishin Districts. The ser vices of an Additional Assistant Political Agent to be granted, ! possible, to Baluchistan for the purpose of yearly visiting and looking after this tract. The establishment to consist of a small revenue establishment and a levy establishment consisting of the present levy post at Nushki and 1 Jemadar, 2 Daffadars and 50 came sowars; the 7 fatter to be employed both in the ordinary administrative work of the Tahsil and in the protection of the Kafila routes south of ot tne iaj an d Seistan. Moderate allowances the boundary line from Persia ana ^eisiau. , , f the for tribal service to be granted to the and he ad 1 th various sections of the Sanjaram tribe and likewise to the of the Rakhshani and Zagar Mingal tribes ; (5) the taking of Government land revenue in the Chagai Distnc , if possible, in the Nushki District also; i establishment of a small sowars (deluded carefully selected moonshi, an y K ^ h . i .

(6) the (7) I venture tojjU'XUmi.JUJ j rr of Baluchistan Provincial Revenues will enable the increased expenditure now advocated to be considered in connection w,th the next Provincial contract. The question of the management of the country which has now come within our boundary line from Sarlat to Persia is one which should be carefully cons.dere d as soon as possible. Delays will render a satisfactory settlement of the question doubly difficult. Simla : The 21 st June i8g6 A. H.

To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Simla I have the honour to submit the following report, with its enclosures re- frnment onndia dlStU1 ' banCes ln Makran - for information of the Gov- , 2 '. ^ ' ill he seen hy reference to previous correspondence that, up to the ® Tld , of r f ast ^ ovember, there was no sign that the arrangements then in force for the Government of Makran were not working satisfactorily. Those ar rangements were, that a Nazim, supported by about ninety of the Kalat re organised troops, controlled the country on behalf of His HMmess the Khan of Kalat. The Nazim was a Hindu official of the Baluchistan Agency—Dewan Udho Hass—whose services had been specially lent to the Khan. 3. The first information that there was unrest in Makran was apparently given to Mr. Barnes by Mr. Knox, the officiating Political Agent of Kalat, last December, on the conclusion of a tour which he had made in Panjgur during November 1897. I have now received Mr. Knox’s official report on that tour, which I attach to these papers, as it bears on the state of Makran immediately preceding the recent disturbances. It will he observed by reference to paragraph 11 of that report that Mr. Knox found the temper of the people in Panjgur far from satisfactory. 4. But the news that any disturbance had actually taken place reached Mr. Barnes only upon the 9th of last January in the form of a telegram from the Khan’s Naib of Kej, who reported that Mehrab Khan, Gitcliki, a brother of the Kej Gitchki Sirdar,* had made the Nazim a prisoner, and had obtained possession of Turbat fort, on the 6th idem. Shortly afterwards information was received from Captain Burn, B.E., from Ormara, that his camp in Kolwa had been suddenly attacked by MirBaluch Khan, Naosherwani, and Mir Rus tam Khan, Gitchki, the latter being a brother of Mir Mehrab Khan. Captain Burn and Lieutenant Turner, It.E., were at that time surveying in Makran, and the former reported that a number of their party had been killed, and the main camp looted, while he escaped to the coast. Lieutenant turner, w T ho was working in another direction, managed to bring in his portion of the survey party to Ormara safely, and subsequently joined the force sent to restore order in the countiy. 5. Although the Nazim managed to escape from Mir Mehrab Gitchki, and was received and sheltered in the fort of Kalatuk by Abdul Katioi, Giteliki, ISaib of Kei, yet by far the larger portion of Makran was temporarily lost to the Khan of Kalat, and was in the hands of the rebels, headed by Mir Baluch Khan, Naosherwani, his son Shah hawaz Khan, Mm Mehrab Khan, Naosherwani, Mir Mehrab Khan, Gitchzi, Mir Shukaru la, Gitchki, and other persons of lesser note, and it was decided that we must at once despatch a force into Makran to re-establish ot ei, ie-ins &lt; _ ^ Nazim, and afford a rallying point for the dispersed members of our survey p r y. 6. A column was accordingly despatched by sea J 1 Tn'rhat'the dezvoused at I’asai on the 2dth of January, an sat a saua- next day. The column consisted of 400 of the 30th Bomb )'•’ B ‘5 dron VI Bombay Cavalry, and 2 guns f HaZ l™ under the command of Lieutenant-Comne^ a}ne, 3^^^^ offi y cer .

The causes of this rising seem to have been as follows :—Mir Baluch Khan, Naosherwani, had been granted a fort called Bit in the district of Boleda in Mekran by the Khan of Kalat. This fort was occupied by Mir Azim Khan, Boledi, who held a sanad for its possession from the Khan of Kalat, and con sequently refused to give it up. When the question was referred to the Agent to the Governor-General, it was given against Mir Baluch Khan, and this incensed him against the Nazim, as he considered that he was responsible for the decision. Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, is young, headstrong and an intriguer. He considers that he would have been Chief of the Kej Gitchkis if we (as re presented hy the late Sir Robert Sandeman) had not interfered to place his elder brother, Sheikh Omar, in that position. It seems certain that Mehrab Khan had been nominated by his father to the Chieftainship as being a far more capable man than Sheikh Omar. This, and apparently some quarrels with the Nazim, induced Mir Mehrab Khan to seize the opportunity of Dewan Udho Hass* being alone and comparatively unprotected, to make bun a prisoner, and seize Turbat fort. The leading men of Kej were the third factor in the rebellion, as they disapproved of the Nazim’s system of taking revenue from all ranks alike ; for the old practice, which was in force before the present form of Government had been established, consisted in the Khan’s Naib making the various Chiefs of the petty Baluch tribes agents for the collection of revenue from their Various tribesmen, for which work they enjoyed immunity from taxation. Another cause of the recent rising, and failure of our present arrange ments in Makran, is the undoubted unpopularity of the Nazim. I do not say that Dewan Udhq Dass is a bad or corrupt officer, but he has the misfortune H &gt;ndu ruling a Mussulman district, and as such was out of toueh with the people, and seems to have been lacking in sympathy with them. It appears a doubtiul policy to place a Hindu over a Muhammadan population, and we have seen the experiment fail before in Baluchistan, where I need only . e f xa f n J! e , of La s Bela, m wliieh State a very good and able Hindu officia! quite failed as Wazir, and where he has been successfully followed by ad t - 1 “p U'e above causes, the unrest, which existed along and the news that ar, 11 p 0t lM d ' aIa rk ye ^' SeemS t0 baTe reaclled to Makran, Eastern Pol and (Ml \ Graves ) ],a&lt;1 been murdered in South- en-aked wltlthelnki.Tk ° |,S T' 6 , lK : avil .''&gt; a ' ld always successfully, engaged with the 1 athan tribesmen, tended to excite men’s minds, and led to a belief that we were soon to he driven into the sea Tt is s,™ • • fi fore, that, when the Makranis heard that the K ' s not suipnsing, there- * 9.

But, as the Government of MrLve aufhorUaWveS declared that it does not approve of this plan, it has to he discarded 7 10. The second plan is the one nowin force It nrovirlpc w of a Nazim of the Khan of Kalat for the whole of Makran and for the codec! tion of taxes w.thout favour from all parties. The Nazim was supported bv called the re-organised troops. It is divided into two portions namelv 200 Infantry, who are nearly all Punjabis, and 60 Brahui Camelrv. They ire all well armed and equipped, and are trained and paid as sepois of the Indian Army. 11. This system of government has proved a very expensive one for the Khan, and is unpopular with him and with the local Chiefs. The Nazim and his establishment cost some Rs. 26,000 per annum. The re-organised troops cost, when first raised as 200 Infantry, Rs. 5c,000 per annum ; hut, since then, 65 Camelry have been raised, additional expenses have been incurred, and their cost is now roughly about Rs. 1.04,000 prr annum as shown in Appendix No. 3. The cost of administration to the Khan is therefore some Rs 1,30,000 a year, while the income is about Rs. 40,000. He is therefore a dead loser by about Rs. 90,000 per annum, a large sum indeed for the Ruler of a mountainous and poor country to have to pay, and he naturally greatly objects to the arrange ment. The Chiefs dislike the present form of government, because, under it, they are compelled to pay revenue, whereas, under the old Baluch system, they were merely tax-gatherers from the poor or less influential parties. 12. I have lately consulted with His Highness the Khan, some of the principal Chiefs of Baluchistan, the Nazim of Makran, Mr. Knox, and others on the best arrangement which we can now make for the future government of Makran. The general view is that the present system has failed. It is, as I have shown, unpopular with the Khan and with the Makran Chiefs, and its expense is prohibitive. But all those whom I have consulted agree, that if a real Balueh form of government is introduced gradually, and with caie, it may succeed, and would be popular with the rulers and ruled. This Government would in great measure be a return to the^ancient form ofinling by Nads, hut care will be taken by the grant of subsidies, and the placing of levy posts at various points to guard the Persian border and watch the Naosherwams Ot Kharan. This scheme is as followsThe Khan wil place three I'aiKs in. Makran, one at Turbat, one at Panjgur, and one Kohva, amalgamated with Mushkai He will grant a small subsidy to the principal Rinds of Mand, and service to the Zamknis, and will place the following three thanas m the countrv :— ... 40 sovrars. ... 10 do. ^ ... do. These sowars would be levies from either theRindsorBizenjosorarnKtere of both, under perhaps Eakir Muhammad, the son of the Bizenjo Chief, Khaira.

They were not even always amenable to the orders of rte Nazim and so would be useless in Makran under the proposed B luchr administration, even if they were willing to stay on there winch they are not. They are now timing furlough, as they have served for three years, good-con- duct pay, compeusation for dearness of provisions, etcetera, which the Khan has agreed to give them as a temporary measure, pending a decision as to future arrangements. These concessions will probably keep the re-organised troops fairly contented until next winter, when I hope we may be able to bring le scheme I have proposed for the future Government ot Makran into working order. When that has been accomplished, 1 would suggest that the Infantry ot the “ re organised troops ” shall be disbanded, and sent back to their homes in thfi PnnVab. and tbe Dost of Military Adviser be abolished. 14. The question of the future of the 60 Brahui Camelry of the re-organised troops is another matter. They appear to be a fine body of men and camels, and are fully equipped like our own cavalry camel sowars. But they are not a tribal body under a Chief, and look alone to Captain Benn for leadership. It is pos sible that, in their present form, they may have to be broken up, and, if neces sary, raised again as “ levies but this is a matter which may be left for futuie consideration, as the present scheme develops. 15. Perhaps the greatest difficulty we shall have to face in Makran is the checking of Kaosherw ani encroachments, which are certain to recommence under the government of Naibs. We have now, how r ever, a hold over Sir ISaoroz Khan, wdiich w r e have never had before, and it is that hold which I pro pose using. Some little time ago Sir Naoroz Khan married the rich widow 7 of the late Kalat Mastaufi, who possesses valuable lands in the districts of Mango- char, Mastung, Quetta, and Kachhi, and I propose telling the Naosherwani Chief that w r e will only look after his interests in those lands if he on his part agrees to curb his tribesmen and his own greed for territory, and keep his hand off Makran. This I hope w ill have a good effect. 16. It w 7 ill be noticed that Mr. Knox in Appendix B of his report No. 885, dated the 3rd May 1898, deals w ith the question of Naosherw ani encroachments in Makran, and seem to suggest the advisability of demarcating the border between Kalat and Kharan. I mentioned this subject to His Highness tiie Khan ; hut he did not seem to consider it necessary, nor indeed to approve of it at all. 17. A point to he remembered in future is, that when the Political Agent of Kalut visits Makran, and when survey officers are sent there, they must he accompanied by proper escorts of Indian troops ; and I quite agree with the remarks w hich Mr. Knox makes, in the 3rd paragraph of his report on the Makran revolt, about the future conduct of surrey parties in the country. 18. I may, in conclusion, say that His Highness the Khan of Kalat fully approves of my proposal with regard to Makrau and the Infantry of his“ re organised troops.” 19 19. I trust the Government of India will permit the existing arrangements tc continue in Mekran for another seven or eight months, and that in the 4meantime I may lie allowed to 'radnallr „» tionof the form of government I have sketched out if “e/ort. ^ intr0da0 ' ordeftosLTthfnew^me^nl Suer Iff ^ ^ Wiflter &gt; ™ that, meanwhile, he deserves great credi? for th^ ° n ^ 16 ‘ ^ \ a ? s a nd Military Adviser might accompany Mr i^ nn _ nTi+1 . , lstrict * ihe Khan s up and disband the Infantry of the' “ re-organised troops?’’' 1 aiTaaS0 t0 pay reporfaudllfann™. 1 C0Uld ^ With P rinted ^ &lt;&gt;£ this APPENDIX 1.

I have the honour to submit the following report on my late tour through Panjgur and the Jhallawan country. ^ 2. On the 2nd November 1897, I started from Kalat, accompanied by an escort of the strength noted in the 1 British officer and 100 rank and file,! 24tk mnrcrin Baluchis. O 1 duffadar and 12 sowars, 5th Bombay Cavalry. 3. The following Chiefs and headmen of the country were also with me throughout my tour :— Sardar Mohim Khan, Gurgnari. Mir Samandar Khan, Lehri. Mir Rahim Khan, Kurd. Mir Isa Khan, Kuchik, Jemadar of Levies. Mir Hazar Khan, Muhamad Shahi. Mir Abdulla Jan, Muhamad Shahi. Mir Tamaz Khan, Sirpara. 4. Mir Shams Shah, Extra Assistant Commissioner, on special duty, and the Political Adviser to Ilis Highness the Khan, accompanied me as far as Gider, 80 miles from Kalat. Several petty disputes were settled en route, while the more important matters were reserved for the Jhallawan Jirga, which was to assemble at Isal. 5. At Gidar, on the 8th November, I parted company with the Political Adviser who remained behind with some of the Jhallawan Chiefs and twenty- five sepoys under a havildar. It was necessary to leave these men behind to guard a portion of the rations which were required for our return journey and not procurable in the country. Mir Shams Shah was directed to proceed slowly towards Nal, and, when there, to use his hest endeavours to collect all tlie Jhallawan C tie s an ^ sse ^ hie a Jirga with a view to the settlement of the many long pen mg ia aw cases. C. On the 11th of November, my party halted at Dhulari, » ™e re ing-ground on the further side of the inhospitable hilly country through wh we had been marching steadily ever since leaving Gidar. The camping-ground is about 3} miles from Shiieza |; t tle a fort belonging to Sardar Sir Nauroz Khan, Naosherwam. Ihere is some cultivation in the vicinity. r6 wjyyyuyHHMBMUU 'mu.! 1 f assafeSRSiv-tt-.'^*.« - &lt;~«n durine* tlie past two years, it was impracticable. At Dlmlari I was ioined by Mir Yabub Eban, the son of the Naosherwani Sardw, w'ao accompanied me as far as i-anjgurand remained with me during my stay there. 8 At Pir Umar some 8 miles from Isai, I was met by the Nazim of Makran, the Kardar of Panjgur, a few of the Kej Gilckkis and all the leading men in Panjgur. 9. Tsai was reached on the 19th of November, and a week’s halt was made, during which many important cases were settled by a local Jirga. A lull settle-. ° ment* (which I trust may prove lasting) * a translation of this settlement with a note on was arrived at in the Panjgur Gitehki’s the case form Appendix a to tins report. case, and I enquired into the vexed ques- tionf of the Sung levied by Sardar Sir Nauroz Khan and the alleged encroach ments of his sepoys within Makran boun- dnries, about which complaints innumer able have been received from both parties to the dispute. 10. The number of cases disposed of at the Panjgur local Jirga is shewn below + Appendix B which I arrived. show the general conclusions at Total number of cases decided Left pending Total 11. The temper of the people in Panjgur (and the Nazim reported a similar and rather more pronounced feeling in Kej) I found far from satisfactory. Tho anarchy and disorder prevailing on the Eastern Persian Erontier, together with the late disturbances among the Sarawan Chiefs, had unsettled men’s minds. The Nazim told me that he had frequently been informed by the Gitchkis in Kej that the British and Persian Governments had ceased to exist, and a Baluchi millennium was at hand, when every body would be able to plunder and quarrel to his heart’s content. I am inclined to think that the presence of a British officer with 100 sepoys has dispelled this pleasing illusion to which I referred in open Durbar with marked effect. 12 . The revenues of Makran will suffer this'year owing to the long con tinued diouglit, which has placed large tracts of country out of cultivation. Kolwa is the only district in Makran in which rain fell during the year. Many crops in Kej have been ravaged by locusts, and the damage done has been very considerable. 6 AffenUo^Hil rnvp^ p an ’ th ? fa , m ' u3 Naoshorwani freebooter, who visited the at S Pah °ur at Q uetta , last year, did not come to meet me he abused the Nn/im nil ’ r ’ 10we ' c u.% which reached me on arrival, in which e abused the fsazim alleging many causes of complaint: notablv the decision ktely given agnmst lum at Quetta in the matter of Pit fort w fh vvbicb the Nazim had nothing to do.

With important matters i 'We saw at his village some really respectable buildings and some karezes newly opened ; while the people seemed contented and of a better class than usual. We found here more cultivation than at many places we had passed on our line of march, where cultivable land with an abundant supply of water lay desolate and neglected. 18. Two more marches brought us to Nal on the 5th December. Here Mir Shams. Shah, with the valuable assistance of Syed Bahar Shah of Dhadar and Khan Bahadur Mir Yusuf Khan had done most excellent work. The Jhallawan Chiefs, notably Sirdar Passand Khan, Zarakzai, the head of the Jhallawans, Sirdar Shahbaz Khan, Muhamad Hnssani, and Mir Eakir Muhamad, son of the Bezenjoe Sirdar, had heartily co-operated with them, and the results were most gratifying. Many most difficult lonsr pending cases had come to a satisfactory con clusion. The Mengal case, which has baffled the Jirgas for years, has been settled amicably, and both parties express themselves perfectly satisfied. The Jhattak-Moosiani dispute, over which a score of lives have been sacri ficed, was brought to a satisfactory conclusion at the end of the tour. 19. The number of cases decided by the Jhallawan Jirgas are shewn below- Decided ... ••• ••• ”* ^ Left pending 113 Total 20. This record, however, does not take any count of the number of trifling claims disposed of by Mir Shams Shah. 1n is confidently expected that the parties will have the common sense to rest satisfied with these informal decisions and that they will never again be heard °f. 21 The decision arrived at in two most important cases, i.e , the Mengal and the Jhattak-Moosiani disputes, will be found m Appendices C and D to this report. 22. A most marked change has come over the Jhallawan Sirdars. When I met them in Kalat last summer, they were sulky, disobedient and dilatory. Now they appear to have really made a determined effort to work well together, and* live at peace with their neighbours and one another. I am convinced that this tour has had a beneficial effect and would strongly recommend that the experiment he repeated and the Jhallawan country be traversed thoroughly every year or at least every other year by the Political Agent or the Political Adviser. 23 It only remains for me to bring to your notice the admuable assistance rendered me by mv escort and the various Chiefs w ho accompanied me. Lieutenant Twigg and his sepoys worked loyally with me throughout a long and trving tour. The health of the troops vas peifec t, their conduct absolutely unexceptionable, and my best thanks are due to the officer in com mand and his men. As for the Chiefs and headmen who came with me, where all worked so well, it would be invidious to make distinctions. Mir Shams Shah’s work has already been alluded to above. No further comment is required. Sirdar Mohim Khan, Gurgnari, Mir Samandar Khan, Lehri, and Mir Itahim Khan, Kurd, were my stand by in every difficulty, and fully justified the trust I reposed in them. The Chiefs of lesser note were most useful. They worked cheerfully through many difficulties and hardships. The assistance given me by the Nnosherwanis in providing supplies—no easy task—was most valuable. Mir Yakub Khan at Panjgur I found most reasonable and ready to help. It was unfortunate that Sirdar Sir Nauroz Khan could not grant him a “ Mukhtiarnama,” as I was, therefore, obliged to leave many important cases pending, in which the Naosherwani Sirdar was concerned. I hope that next year the Sirdar will himself he able to accompany me, and some of the important questions with which Appendix B is concerned may he set at rest. P.S —l regret very much the delay that has occurred in the submission of this report. It was, with the exception of a few details, ready for submission last January, when I vas suddenly called away by the disturbances in Kej and Kalwa. I have purposely left the bulk of the report, and all remarks connected with the general feeling of the people, etc., unaltered, as I considered it best to show vhat was the impression 1 had formed of the State of Makran before the disturbances arose.

APPENDIX B. flcte on the Kharan-KaJat boundary, th a Sung on the Panjgnr-Kaht and Kolwa-Kalai routes and the encroachments committed by Naoxherwani Sepoys and others within Makran limits. It is best to explain at the commencement that conversation with the people of the country convinces an impartial observer that there is, at present, properly speaking, no Kharan-Kalat boundry. The rights alleged rest on a very shallow foundation. It is only within quite recent years that there has been, in this part of the country, any exception to “ The good old rule the simple plan that he should take who has the power and he should keep who can. ’’ 2. I would disclaim here any authority for this note. It has been compiled from stray conversation, notes made here and there and is simply intended to give a general idea of the opinions of the people who live on the border and are naturally most interested. 3. Commencing from the extreme w'est, B. P. 2 of the Parso-Baluch Commission, we pass to a point where the RodT-Mashkel and Rakshan join to form the Tank-i-Gwarag and thence follow the watershed of the Rakshan to somewhere near the Seminj pass, where the boundary takes a sharp turn to the south on to the Rakshan river. Here the first serious difference of opinion arises, the Naosherwani Sardar says that the boundary should cut the river at Sardar*i-Chah, the Khan says at Kenig-i-Chah. The boundary now crosses the river and climbs the hills on the opposite side, traverses the watershed of Rakshan and Gitchk to Zangilak and thence drops into the valley. We leave Saka-Kalat on our right and make for the Gitchk, follow that stream to its junction M T ith the Raghai and so down along their united waters; we pass Pashtkoh on the right of the river, where Sardar Sir Nouroz Khan lias a sum* post (of which more hereafter) and finally arrive at Awar, the junction of the Tank and Mashkai. J Here again we find the parties cannot agree. Sardar Sir Nauroz Khan declares that the boundary should now -o south L°nd S on e the V bank ol ° ultivable This would seem to be a verv unnatural line for fair to the Sardar to say that the whole of the strip Gwarjak is, to its sorrow, a slice of “ no man’s land land. it to take, but it is only from Dahira-na-bent to ” or rather everv man’sThe result is that it is pareelW ^ 4 . • , a fixed boundary is an impo Ss ibiia, v .

It will be seen that he holds an almost undisputed title to the Rakshan and Raghai valleys, in which the two nearest routes to Kalat from Ranjgurlie. He has extended his influence over the l ank and lately established a thana at Pashtkob, where the rough Soler hill track enters the Tank. This stops a possible escape for the carvans by the Mashkai route, even supposing that a Paijjgur carvan would take the trouble to add four days to its journey. 5. In the Mashkai, the highway from Kalat to Kolwa, the Naosherwani #p , ^ ^ power is considerable.

C „ 1 robbing passers-by on this pretence. that lie has stopped t he route from Kolwa somewhere below. Tlie evidence is very conflicting. Unfortunately I was unable to visit the spot with the complain ants who admitted that they had only heard a rumour to this effect. 6. “ L’appetit vienf en mangeant” Nauroz Khan has lately, i.e., within the last two years, established five new chowkis for the collection of Sung, If this propensity is not checked, he will certainly commence the levy of Sung in the Mashkai before long, if he has not already done so. 7. Of these five posts the first was dignified by the name of a chon ki. An impudent robber, Paku, a Naosherwani slave, established himself in Sell Gazan and took whatever he could get, using the Sardar s name as a shield. In a settlement lately concluded in Quetta, these lands, had been given by the Sardar to Mir Ghulam Muhamad, a Naoshervvam, and were on y 11south of the *Ral^han'rlver'bejon^Isal'/and the right to the Sung is absolutely imaginary. I had, therefore, no compunction in ordering *|j e ^ ^t Paku wherever found if he repeated this practice. I told Mir Yakub Ji.Han to recall Mm at once and warned him that any body attempting to collect dues in those dXicts would be arrested. I wrote to Sardar Sir Nauro, to tins etlect. 8 Another chowki no amount of searching in the maps enabled me to discover I gathered however that it was somewhere wol to the north of'the Rakshan, and stopped a route into Kharan country. /Ihere seemed to he no particular objection to this, and I refused to interfere in the absence ot orders. 9. Two more chowkis were placed —the one at Kenig-i-Chah and the other at Pasht Koh. As these are apparently within Sir Isauroz Khan s territory, 1 did not interfere in the absence of orders. 10. The fifth chowki was the one which is alleged to have been^posted in the Mashkai, hut against this I must urite a verdict of “Not proven. 11. These chowkis are an intolerable nuisance. Nauroz’s sepoys come down into Makran limits, on the pretence of levying “Sung,” grazing tax, and other rights, real or imaginary. 12. The grazing tax abuse is a crying one. Encouraged by impunity, the smaller Jhallawan Sardars follow Nauroz’s example, and small parties of banditti wander over the hills and plunder the wretched shepherds of a sheep or two whenever they can. When the robbers are hungry and in want of a dinner, they are naturally not particular as to where they get it from. 13. I gave orders to the Nazim and have since told all Sardars, w r ho are , . concerned, that thev must, at least in This particular order has, much to my surprise, f , ^ i? xU had some effect, and the various Sardirs have asked iVlakrail limits, SCOK the aid 01 the proper for the assistance of Government officials in the authorities, and that anv man, unauthoriz- most exemplary manner. . . „ . . . . i ,1 ed and found levying this tax, whether he can prove that he is in the right or no, will be arrested. The Nazim declares that he can, with the help that the people will give him willingly, enforce these orders, but whether he can or no, at least the Sardars cannot, in future, plead ignorance. It is possible that some good may be done by these recent orders, though I confess I am not sanguine. APPENDIX C. Translation of the Jirga decision in the case between Sardar Vmr Khan, Moosiani, and Sardar Shah buz Khan, J halt ah, dated 22nd December 1S97.

Thus, according to this decision, Rs 6 000 m a were due from Sardar Umr Khan, Moosiani, to Sardar Shahbaz Khan Jhattak Afterwards in June 1897 Sardar Shahbaz Khan, Jhattak, being dissatisfied with the decision of 1896, raised a following, and attacked the Moosiam village. In this attack, five men of the Jhattaks were killed and sixteen wounded by the Moosianis; and on the side of the Moosianis the lawful wife of Sardar Umr Khan, Moosiani, died by the hand of the Jhattaks and another person was wounded. ‘ * The Jhattak Sardar explains his action by saying that he was dissatisfied with the decision of 1896. By this action ofhis, i.e., not abiding by the deci sion of 1896 all the old trouble came up anew. This is a most difficult and intricate case and one of very longstanding between the two Sardars, and from the file it is apparent that never yet has there been any true or heart-felt reconciliation, and this is the reason why, in carrying out the decisions, so much difficulty lias been experienced. We, the members of the Jirga, with a view to a decision, have taken the greatest care and looked at the matter from every point of view. The result has been that to-day Sardar Umr Khan, Moosiani, taking with him Sardar Pasand Khan, Zarakzai, Syed Mir Baliar Shah, and all the Jhallawar Sardars, has gone to Sardar Shahbaz Khan, Jhattak, and implored him to put an end to their differences, and for this reason has taken all the Sardars with him to intercede for him. Sardar Shahbaz Khan, Jhattak, has also agreed to his proposal, and said that he also wishes a settling up of accounts between them, and that no further cause of quarrel may remain. Sardars Shahbaz Khan, Jhattak, and Umr Khan, Moosiani, with one ar-cord, have informed the Jirs^a that, concerning their ancient quarrels about blood- money, wounds and various kinds of compensation, all claims except the blood- money of Sona and Badal Jhattaks have been settled between them the two parties, by mutual good will and consent in consequence of the intercession of the Jhallawar Sardars and other notables, and no claims now remain, and they will not make any in future. This decision has been arrived at with perfect consent and purity of heart, against which they will never rebel, and this decision also coveis t e ecisum of 18th September 1896. Sardar Shahbaz Khan especially declares that, although his claims a =a.n. t the Moosiani ore larger than the opposing claim aga.inst himself, he has of h.s own free will, because of the intercession above alluded to, pardoned everjt ,, to the Moosiani Sardar. Sardar Pasand Khan, Zarakzai, Syed Mir Bahar Shah, and 'ther Sardars, who want to intercede with Sardar Shahbaz Khan, in &gt; respective meat, and declare that both parties have entirely abondoaed their respective ISIBJUMMOHIII until 1IJI IIWl claim.

On this account it is n ohtt ^ ** Sardar Umr Khan has asked for time to enable him to pay the full Rs. 4 00U and we, with the consent of both parties, have agieed that the Moosiani Sardar shall pay the amount within two years in two equal instalments. The first instalment of Rs. 2,000, which includes the Government fine, will he paid on the 22nd December 1898. The second will he paid on the same date in the following year. As the question of the hloodmoney of Sona and Badal Jhattaks has been decided, the Jhattak and Moosiani Sardars have agreed in the presence of the entire Jirga, that now all their former quarrels have been disposed of for ever, and now between them no claim or dispute remains. They will honestly and truthfully abide by this decision in future. Therefore a detailed agreement executed by them forms part of the file. And now, because these very intricate and long pending disputes have been with the good will and consent of both parties finally put an end to, it is hoped that in future they will remain at peace, and no further claim or quarrel will remain, and they will live amicably, and the Jirga congratulate themselves on the success of their strenuous exertions. Therefore this report is put forward with a view to final sanction. Signed Mir Shams Shah, Political Adviser to His Highness the Khan. Seal of Sardar Pasand Khan, Zarakzai.

Claim llajdari. To ' d i a3r m t t '’?- preSen mf both tbe parties this case was placed before us the members of J.rga. The file together with the Jirga award of the 26th September 1896 and the statement ot Mir Hamza Mengal was read over. From the correspondence in the file and from the evidence of the parties themselves it appears that there are two disputes to be settled (1) Mir Hamza Mengal complains that Sirdar Shakar Khan cannot control his tribe. He ought to prove this, and, in the event of his failing to do so, should be punished. (2) There is a dispute between Sirdar Shakar Khan and Mir Ibrahim Khan as to the collection of revenue, etc., from the members of tbe tribe and as to the control of the tribe. The parties declare that the case was settled in the Sibi Jirga of the 2nd February 1897, but Mir Wali Muhamad (son of Mir Ibrahim Khan) says that Sirdar Shakar Khan does not abide by the orders contained in the settlement referred to. These two questions have to-day been fully discussed. As regards the first dispute, Sirdar Shakar Khan says that at the time Mir Hamza complained against him he was opposed to him owing to certain private disagreements. At that time Sirdar Shakar Khan and Mir Ibrahim Khan were not on friendly terms with each other at the time, and now both tbe parties have b^en reconciled and are at peace. In those days Mir Hamza, seeing that the parties were at variance, complained against Sirdar Shakar Khan, but now the Sirdar humbly requests and strongly recommends that, as he and Mir Ibrahim Khan have been reconciled, no explanations may be required from Mir Hamza in this matter, for he has also been reconciled with him. As regards the second dispute, Sirdar Shakar Khan says that he has willing ly settled the matter with Mir Ibrahim Khan and that both the parties have settled this matter by mutual consent, and there are no further disputes b - weenthem.

The Nazims report on the march of events before my arrival at Turbat forms Appendix I. . Slehrab Khan had thus successfully established a revolution in Kej.^ He now sent messages to his brother, Mir Rustam Khan, who had been appointed as escort to Captain Burn, Royal engineers, the officer in charge of No. 24 Survey Party, working in the Kolwa hills. Mir Rustam Khan concerted an attack with Mir Baluch Khan, Noshir- wani, on the survey main camp, w'hile Captain Burn was out on a hill some miles away. The attack was in every way successful. A large quantify of loot was secured, many men of the party were killed, and much valuable property destroyed. As I understand Captain Burn has issued a full report on this outrage, I shall here confi ne myself to a few general remarks and recommendations for the future conduct of survey parties in this country. * Mir Rustom Khan’s partin the affair is absolutely indefensible. Even from the point of view of a Baluch, which is often held to excuse acts which our stricter morality would condemn without hesitation, his attack w r as treacherous in the highest degree. At the same time, lam inclined to think that the survey party would have suffered less and perhaps even remained unmolested, if they had not taken with them two temptations, irresistible to a frontier tribesman. In the first place, there w r ere a large number of rifles which, it may be remarked in passing, proved useless when the emergency, for which they had been provided, arose. These rifles were in the possession of men wdio had little, or no, knowledge of how to use them. It is of the first importance that, if rifles are carried at all, they should be in the hands of regu ar troops. In the second place, Captain Burn had arranged to take with him all the money required for the payment of his party for a period of near y S!X moil is. This sum amounted to nearly Bs. 20,000 at the time of the a ac c * . , strongly recommend that, in future, the survey officer shou c no P , , him more than, at the outside, Ks. 5,000 for working .'f, lie simple enough to arrange with the Local Government an small supplies of money as they were needed. ^4. To return to TurTmfc, Mir Mehrab Khan, Gitchivi, was joined a few days later by his brother and Mir Baluch Khan. The number of the rebels increased rapidly, as the news of their success was spread abroad. Appendix It shows a list of the principal leaders, the various acts of hostility for which each was responsible, where they now are, and the punishment awarded to each delinquent. Small parties of the rebels moved in the direction of the sea coast, looted Pasni and virtually destroyed all the telegraph lines from Pasni to Gwadur. They attempted with some success to drive off camels from the country between Ormara and Pasni, as Mir Mehrab Khan rightly judged that an advance of troops from Ormara would be hindered, or even absolutely stop ped, if camels were not forthcoming. They threatened the loyal Chiefs, who were protecting the Khan’s repre sentative at Kalatuk, and did all in their power to induce them to join the revolt. Some of their methods were truly ludicrous. Mir Abdul Karim and Sardar Sh’Omer were informed by the mullahs that, if they persisted in thwart ing the triumph of Islam, they would become monkeys with long tails. 5. As soon as Captain Burn’s telegram was received in Karachi, the Gen eral Officer Commanding detached a wing of the 30th Bombay Infantry under Colonel Mayne to Ormara. This prompt action was of the greatest service. The news spread quickly and convinced the wavering that the British Govern ment intended to support the Khan’s representative, while the more intelligent Chiefs realized that the suppression of the rebellion was only a matter of time. 6. I joined Colonel Mayne’s column on the 17th January at Ormnra. Transport difficulties delayed our departure for Pasni, whither it was decided to change the base of operations, until the 20th. We reached Pasni on the 2oth, and here the column was increased to 400 infantry and two mountain guns. On the 27th, Colonel Mayne’s force started for Turbat. I remained behind to help on the cavalry who arrived on the 27th. We left Pasni on the morning of the 2£tli and caught up the main body on the morning of the 3tst. We were just in time for the fight. Baluch Khan with his following, estimated at about 1,500 men, had decided to oppose Colonel Mayne’s advance on Turbat at a defile, called Gok-Prusht. The enemy’s flanks were turned, and their defeat was complete. They fled in disorder, leaving Mir Baluch Khan and Mir Mehrab Khan, Noshir wan is, and Mir Shukr Ullnh, an influential Gitchkifrom lump, dead on the field. Their total loss in killed and wounded may he estimated at about 150. Our own loss was small. f° rce marched into Turbat that evening and found the fort occupied by Mn Mein ah Khan, Gitchki. It was watched night and day but not attacked, as it was considered necessary to await the arrival of explosives and oi tne sappers and miners. The sappers and miners marched in on the evening of the 2nd of Februarv W, 1 tlf a - ta ?i k r iir P l f&gt; i n I led , f , 0 /, tLe followin S morning, when a report na brought m that Mir Mehrab Khan had escaped during the night. 8.

This case of Slier Muhammad and some verv excusable mistakes which occuired on the first day after our arrival in Turbat when some Chiefs were disarmed, were the only occasions on which the friendly natives of the country had any reason to complain of the Makran Field Force. It should not be forgotten that Mir Sher Muhammad is not entitled to any great sympathy. He has always been troublesome, aud his conduct daring the rising has been by no means unfiinchingly loyal. Before the troops arrived in Kej, he was continually importuning the Nazim to make over to him Nas.'rabad fort, as the price of his devotion. I have little doubt in my own mind that the information on which I acted was correct, and that he had assisted Mir Mehrab Khan’s family in getting out of the country. I was glad then to take advantage of an outburst of loyalty, in which he proposed his readiness to follow me to London, to suggest the advisability of bis accompanying me to Quetta to assist us in our delibera tions on the future of Makran. lie is now with me, and I am more confident of a peaceful hot weather for Makran than I should have beeu, if he had remain ed behind. 9. As there were not sufficient rations for a move on Mand, the column returned to Turbat, and a portion was detached under the command of Major Even, 30th Bombay Infantry, to proceed to Bolida. I accompanied this portion of the force. We reached Chib, perhaps the most important village in the Bolida district, on the 19th February. Mir Mehrab Khan, Naosherwani, the owner of Chib fort, bad beeu killed at Gok-Prusht, and the village was deserted. 'We baited two days, and Chib and Kooshk forts were demolished, while Bit fort was left in charge of Mir Azim Khan, Boledhi, until it could he garrisoued by Kalat State Troops. This has since been done, and Jemadar Abd-ur-B ah man has been left there with a garrison of 30 camel-sowars and 30 sepoys of the Kalat State Iroops. He has orders to prevent any Naosherwani from setting foot in the Bolida distiicfc, to arrest any Naosherwani who comes there armed and to shoot him, if lie resists. The Jamadar is, I believe, a thoroughly reliable man, fearless and loval, and I trust that the mere knowledge that these are his orders wi keep the peace in Bolida, until some more satisfactory arrangement can he arrived at. A sum of Bs. 100 per mensem has been sanctioned for roza and payment for information. This money is to be placed at the disposa Jemadar Abd-ur-Bahman, but he is to submit a monthly account of his penditure to the Nazim, and a copy is to be seat to me. 19Bolida has been described as the door of Makran, and I have felt justified in takino-venr stron? measures for its protection. The Naosberwam interests have bad here a far better and more established title than in any other part of Makran, and here they will probably try and make their hrst reprisals. If the Jemadar does his work thoroughly, it will be impossible for the JSaosher- wanis to make any attack in force on any part of Makran without our being fully warned. If w r e are so warned, the Makran administration with the force at its disposal should be able to make an adequate defence. 10. TheBolida and Turbat Columns met at Kalatuk on the 24th February and made a combined march on Hand. Nasirabad was the first place where any important business was trans- acted. It will be remembered that the fort of Nasirabad was taken over from MirSber Muhammad, Gitchki, by Captain LeMesurier, and that a party of 40 sepoys from the Kalat State Troops was stationed there. This detachment was, I understand, intended to overawe Mir Sher Muhammad, and keep the Kasirabad district quiet. As Mir Sher Muhammad had already received a very severe lesson at Charbuk, and I had already .thought of taking him with me to Quetta for the next six months, there seemed to be no object in keeping a garrison any longer at Nasirabad. 11. On the other hand, I had received orders that Tump was to be assessed for revenue, and it was of the utmost importance that a strong force should be posted there for the maintenance of the Khan’s authority. Accordingly, I arranged that the party of the Khan’s troops should march to Tump with the column and occupy Mir Murad Gitchki’s fort there. Mir Murad is the Sirdar of Tump and a foolish old man, who has been in the habit of amusing himself by firing off a harmless old cannon from the top of his fort, while his friends and relations partition the family estate below. From his strength we had nothing to fear'; from his weakness everything. I saw the Sirdar at Balachah and communicated to him the decision at which I had arrived. He demurred at first, but, when I told him that he could not he allowed to play at living in a fort without, governing the country, he accepted the position. Tump fort was garrisoned on the 27th of February by 40 Kalat State sepoys under Jemadar Madad Khan. Later, a Subadar and GO sepoys of the 80th Bombay Infantry were added, but these have since been ithdiawnunder orders from the Government of India. Arrangements have been made lor the garrison to be raised to a strength of IGO^men of whom 10 are camel-sowars. While at Tump, I collected all the motabars and headmen and informed them that their district was to pay revenue in future. They agreed. ,. 12 - T p be , co ^ umn next marched to Maud. All the heads of the principal sections of the Bind tribe met me here.

Prom them I very seldom differed ; and then only when I had reason to believe that their advice was vitiated by either hostility or partiality. I pronounced what I •A 0 on’o t T a / air punishment on the Kej valley, namely, a fine of Rs. o0,000. I then drew up a general list in which I included all those who had been reported to me as concerned in the recent outbreak. Evidence was next taken as to the property of: each delinquent and the extent of his guilt. I had before written letters to all the persons, mentioned in my list, to the effect that, if they came in to me, they would not be imprisoned and their cases would 'be settled locally. I concluded by warning them that, if they did not come in and submit, their punish* ment would be doubled. In fixing the fine afterwards of those who had not returned, I reduced this sentence to the proportion of three to two, as I was informed that the double rate would press too hardly. Some consideration was also paid to those who had suffered in the loot and pillage which followed the action of Gokprusht. This was not done by the troops but by rascals from the hills and vagabonds of every description who took advan tage of the general confusion to come down under cover of the darkness and loot the Kej villages. On the above data the proportion which each individual was to bear in the payment of the fine was fixed. I directed the Nazim to levy this fine with all possible lenity and con sideration in the matter of instalments. As for the absentees, their estates were to be confiscated to the Khan, and the Kiian’s Naib was ordered to look after their cultivation and to keep a care ful account of the profits which accrued. The proprietor’s share was to be credited to the Khan and, when the total amounted to the fine fixed on the owner, the estates were to be declared free. If, in the meantime, the proprie tors returned, their estates were to he handed back to them, provided they made suitable arrangements for the payment of the fine imposed. Any remons trances were to be addressed to the British authorities at Quetta.or to His Highness the Khan, and such remonstrances would be carefully considered. I imagine that in nearly all instances the proprietors will return. The few exceptions will be those who have committed themselves too deeply to believe, in spite of our promises, that they can ever hope for pardon. . Such persons are best out of the country. They will probably be men of no impor tance, such as Mir Eustam Khan’s sowars who were the actual murderers oi some of the helpless members of the survey party. When the fines are paid, their estates should be handed over to their heirs. If these cannot be found, the land should be adjudged to His Highness. 21i • „ I held a durbar, at 16.

Colonel Mnyne with l of'tl e infantrv marched down to Ormara ; the cavalry guns and sap- most of the mtan r infantry, under the command of Captain Jacob, B 5 SLCT&amp;SJ. « * W- «* M-1.1.1 Talley. 18 On onr way up to Kolwa, the demolition of the forts at Sharig, Nag, Hor Kalat and Selira was the only matter which calls for notice in this report. it Ttedi the eastern point of the Kolwa plain, all the principal headmen of Kolwa were collected. The chief tribes here are the Mirwams, Kodais and Umranls, a section of the Bezenjos. There has always been some doubt whether revenue should he levied on these people or no. I was informed that, towards the close of Captain Macdonald s adminis tration, orders were given to Mir Kahim Khan, Kurd, the Khans raio m Kolwa, to collect revenue from them. The orders were communicated to the tribes concerned and were on the point ot being enforced, when Captam Mac donald and his staff were withdrawn from Makran. Ko revenue was therelore realized hut since the Nazim’s administration was established, tin re appears to have been an understood principle that everybody throughout Makran was expected to pay revenue, unless they conld show Khan’s sanads to the contrary. It is doubtful whether these tribes can show any sanads, but the levy of revenue from them raises a large question, because they are equal to, if not superior in rank to, many tribes elsewhere in Baluchistan, who are exempt. In my interview with the headmen, I, with an immediate end in view, placed the matter on the broad ground of the right of a Government to levy revenue. I informed them that, as they claimed exemption on the ground of independence, now was the time to give a proof of their claim. If, abstain ing from internal dissensions, they could keep Kolwa quiet and by the'r united strength prevent the Naosherwanis of whose encroachments all complain, from living in and plundering Kolwa (the two expressions are practically the same), they would show that their claim had a foundation in fact and was worth con sideration. If they could not do this, it followed that they must he protected and they could not expect to be protected for nothing; in other words, the Khan would levy revenue. 19. At Bedi, I was glad to meet the servants of Sirdar Sir Naoroz Khan, K.C.I.E. I took the opportunity to send a friendly letter to him, asking him to find out from Shah Nawaz Khan, son of Mir Baluch Khan, Naosherwani, the reason for his father’s revolt. 1 expressed a hope that the Sirdar would soon be able to return to Quetta, where many questions of importance awaited his presence for settlement.The Sirdar, I understood from his serrw . , pdof assisting rebels, was inclined to stand aloof‘from H,' ' P | nil S ht ,;e s «spect- wanis who had caused the disturbance in Kolwa e malc0nteilt ^'aosher- I therefore added in rav letter tint th; 0 attitude of this portion of the Naosherwani familv U ] nn H C( + SSar,V 4 ^ ie the Government of India, was largeW 'of‘it 8 / h( ‘ ir &amp; ; ardarand that the Government would welcome’anv sio-n tint n i , tl ’ oubies &gt; an&lt;1 sought the protection of, and sabmUt^' Weir lawful“s^!““ 8 had 20. The revolt in Makran has now been suppressed and T t,..,„t « t it temporary arrangements which I have described hi 'the’ precedin ' p a ‘ e f v u be sufficient to keep he peace during the present hot weather! But these arrangements will not keep the country quiet forever, and it will be absolu elv necessary to send an officer into Makran next vear. Mv stay in the country was necessarily limited. It was an object of the first importance to get the troops out of Makran as soon as possible. My movements were bound to coincide with theirs, and I found that a delay of one or two days, cause 1 bv myself, would entail a corresponding delay of a month or two for them as rations would have to be brought from Karachi. The task, therefore, of establishing anything resembling a permanent sys tem of Government was out of the question, even it I had been rash enough 'to venture on carrying out such a scheme without having it first sanctioned by higher autiiority. This duty is reserved for next year. 21. Before making any suggestions as to the form which such a Govern ment should take, it will be convenient to set forth, as shortly as possible, the reasons which, in my opinion, caused the outbreak. In paragraph 11 of my report on Panjgur affairs, No. 88', dated 3rd May 1898, I wrote: “ The temper of the people I found far from satisfactory, etc., etc. ” This was only another way of describing some traces of the wave of fanaticism which has swept over our North-Western Frontier. Everywhere men were ready for a revolt on the first opportunity. But Makran warriors are not very ready to risk their lives and fortunes for their religion, and we must look for more immediate causes of dissatisfaction. These were three in number, and each grievance concerned one of the three principal parties of the conspiracy respectively. The latter were— (1) Mir Baluch Khan, Naosherwani. (2) Mir Mehrab Khan* Gitchki. (3) The headmen of the Kej valley. I give Baluch Khan the place of honour, because, without his support, the revolt would have been impossible. His grievance was Bit fort \\ hen he came to Quetta in the spring of 1897, the Khan gave him a ^nad granting him the fort and revenues of Bit. Mir Azim Khan, Bule lhi, refused to give up t i a a o crinnrl from the Khan. This sanad was upheld and Mir the fort and produced a sanad trom me ivuan. x . A , , pAnlf , Baluch Khan was informed that the revenues rcmamed h.s, but t e fort could not be banded overto him. It is also asserted that, w on ® alU w lh B' luck to collect the revenues, Azim Khan fired a h.m from tlm fort valk ^ Babich Khan maintained that Azim Khan won f | ^ rightly or ho knpw that some stronger influence was working with him, a D . . lie knew that some siron^ei . , i thi conduct to the Nazim’s advice. wrongly, the Naosherwani chief attll py n As soon as the news of the As far as I know, bis suspicion was groundless ^ A ^ strong letters t„ first Bit settlement reached Makran, A. , a(1 al ^ ays ] oya lly assisted Captains Macdonald andBenn,asking ' '. ‘ r it seems therefore the British Government, had been treated mth s man e- It se ^ improbable that the Nazim, who was m Ke at, ' aen Makran, could have incited Azim Khan to resista .4 msmp Bnlucl, Khan felt this .lerply. ^oL^T^rteToferpowel ^X^stS^ott^shaT Mir Murad’s passion for artillery practice noted above is an instance in pmn . I bare heard a story to the effect that the Nazira cheated P,a nch Khan out .1 • »1 * 0 . M‘ 'jtr .0 S to «.“i. to Sirdar Allahvar Khan, Rustorazai, in which lie says that he has only received the Bit revenues for one year. He seems to have expected two years revenue But the sanad, granting; the revenues, was only signed in ± a' st and the year is not yet over. This is probably the ongra of ihe story I have alluded to. Babich Khan openlv proclaimed that the British Government had broken faith with him in the matter of Bit fort, and 1 think the reasons, set forth above, ^re sullicient to account for bis conduct, Mir Mehrab Kban, Gitcbld, has always been hostile to tbe English. There is no doubt that, if Sir Robert Sandernan bad not visited the country, he would have been the Gitchki Sirdar. Indeed, be would be so tomorrow, if Makran was abandoned to its fate, as he is a far more capable man than, his brother, Sh’Omer, the lawlul Sirdar. Finding the Nazim off bis 'hard and knowing that Mirs Abdul Karim and Sheikh'kasim Kban, Gitchkis, who alone could have opposed him were BO miles away, Mir Mehrab Khan seized bis opportunity. It is not known that be had any further reasons for bis conduct, but there seems to have been a prevailing opinion in Makran that the British Govern ment would not use force, and that raising disturbances was sound policy and produced wealth and honours. The headmen of the Kej valley objected to the payment of revenue. Their influence is considerable, especially wdien they pose as public champions against the oppressive practice of levying taxes. The Khan’s Naibs used to employ them as agents for the collection of revenue and, unless they were exempt from payment themselves, they proved very unsatisfactory agents. Ills Highness the Khan, with the advice of the Political Agent, Captain LeMesurier, established a government which had some force at its disposal, and all classes, with the exception of a very few favoured individuals, had to pay alike. It was hardly to be expected that the new system would he relished by men who had long been exempt and Mehrab Khan commenced his rule by showering sanads of exemption in every direction. The result of careful enquiry inclines me to believe that the complaints against the tyranny of the Nazim and Mir Abdul Karim had little foundation in tact. Ihe manner of levying revenue was that which obtains in the rest of British Baluchistan. Jwo people of the country were assessors, a patwari represented the Government and the two parties haggled over the question until they came to an agreement. If an agreement was found impossible, the Nazim heard the case, inspected the ground and finally fixed the amount. 22. It now remains for me to make suggestions for the future Government of the country.

But let us grant that it is possible to raise a force of purely local men who would serve under a local commandant. In order to obtain objects which I understand the Government have in view, namely, a peaceful and prosperous district, it is absolutely necessary to have that force sufficiently well-armed to overawe the natives of the country. They must not only be able to fio-ht successfully, but they must be able to prevent any chance of fighting Does it seem, then, wise to place a force of this description at a longdistance from the capital ? What guarantee have we that Brahuis, for instance, finding them selves well-armed, would not, in a moment of impatience or alarm, raise the standard of revolt ? They have done so before (1897) with far less chance of success. Again, is itnot probable that such a force would overawe the government of the country (I presume a native administration) as much as, if not more than, they w'ould the natives of the country. Udho Bass’s Nizamat has been a continuous struggle with the Kalat State troops. I do not so much fear actual mutiny as I anticipate the endless intrigues and mutual complaints which have characterized the Nazim’s regime. The troops in Makran are discontented. The duties are light and the one besetting danger in Makran is idleness. Again, the question of granting sufficient furlough and at the same time of not dangerously denuding Makran of troops is a difficult one with the force at present at our disposal. The withholding of furlough is a fruitful source of discontent. The onl^ remedy for this is more troops and more troops mean more expense. Makran prices are generally at famine rates and compensation for dearness of provisions did not form part of the scheme for raising the Kalat State troops, ine men put the high prices down to the tyranny of the Government ^PJ es ® n ^ 1^® and, unless the latter is prepared to sacrifice the interests of t ie a e 0 1 of the troops, lie is detested. This ill-feeling vents itself m comp am s short rations, swindling and oppression of all kinds. In m P roS f .^i nr0 ved Biwan Udho Bass, a far cleverer man than his adversaries, successfully pi Jo** perfect K lomSte againstlhe troops, interference with the people of the country, Iwt^ on occasions, etc., etc. The only result of thus quarrell.ng .s to raise a cloud of accusations and denials-accusations impossible to prove, denials im- possible to refute. Ibe admiristration is hopelessly weakened and the dissatisfaction extreme^ 25. For this state of things there is only one remedy. A British officer must live in Makran, look after the troops and settle their grievances. 06 If it is decided to keep one there, it would be as well to utilise his services politically, and it would not he necessary to keep sueh an expensive Official as the Nazim in Kej. The present pay of the Military Adviser would he sufficient He would he well able to hold his own with the Kalat State troops at his back, and the only difficulty would be the expense of the arrange- ment as pointed out above. 27. There is one method of slightly decreasing this deficit, and that is. to insist on the Gitchkis who share the revenues hearing their share of the cost of the administration. This is a perfectly legitimate measure, but the pro bable result in practice would he that the Gitchkis would cease to exert them selves in, even if they did not actively oppose, the collection of revenue and our receipts would fall off. 28. If a prosperous and well-governed Makran is worth the deficit of Es. 55 , 000 , it would be perfectly simple to induce the Khan to consent to the proposal. 29. With a system of levies which could he maintained for about Us. 30,000, I see no reason why our principal objects should not be attained. I conceive these to be— (a) a peaceful Ealuch border, (b) the safety of the telegraph line between Ormara and Gwadur, (c) the safety of British officers and survey parties who are required to move about the country. I would leave the revenue to be collected by the Khan’s officials accord ing to the traditions of the country. The revenue returns will of course fall off, hut the Khan will not lose, as his outlay will he Its. 30,000 as against the lowest estimate of Rs. 55,000 noted above. Against this expenditure of Its. 30,000 he can setoff whatever revenue his Naibs can collect—probably at least Rs. 15,000. Provided the Naosherwanis are bound down to some such agreement as has already been referred to in my telegram No. 31, dated 28th February 1898, of which a proposed draft forms Appendix Y, the border could he controlled by a strong Bezenjo thana in Hand. The safety of the telegraph line would he insured by the subsidies already granted, if there are no causes of irritation at work in the country, as, for instance, the recent levy of revenue from all alike. British officials and survey parties will have to he escorted by regular troops at least for some time to come. 30. This would be a return to the old Baluch form of Government, the only a Iteration being the provision of a certain number of levies who would be regularly paid by the Political Adviser much on the system in which the Jhallawan subsidies are disbursed. •i. • . 11 ; e , ie l S i reas0I1 i s ^ a ^ e the country should be any worse than itismthe Jhallawan nils or Kharan and the spread of civilization is bound o come grac ua y, and, in my opinion, tar more surely than if British methods are hastily torced upon a people ill-fitted for their reception 26 *nut, u j. iniguu oe ravoured with V vei T general na followed, I would endeavour to remedy this defertina si,!, line °! r ’° lic - v 32.

From —The Nazim of Makran, To—The Political Agent, Kalat, I beg to report that at about 1 a.m. on the 6 th January last, TVIit Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, attacked me while I was asleep in my house, made me a prisoner and killed Munshi Basaram, Muhasib,and Walidad, Levy Sowar, and wounded Munshi Kunjlal. I had only three or four Levy Sowars with me, as the re mainder had gone with my camp in the direction of Nasirabad. The sepoys who were in the fort were unable to come to my assistance, as the attack was a complete surprise, and I was arrested before they had time to realise that anything had gone wrong. Mehrab Khan then promised to release me if Turbat tort was delivered up, hut threatened to kill me if it was not, and I have little doubt that he meant to keep his word. Though in the meantime I tried my best to get help from the sepoys in the fort, but could not get it, and there appeared to be no alternative but to comply with bis terms, and the fort was accordingly banded over to him. After Mir Mebrab Khan got possession of the Turbat fort, be released me and looted a great deal of Government and private property as per two lists herewith attached. lie was still anxious to put me to death, but as I ban managed to keep a few r Kej Motbars, who had assembled in the meantime with me, he could not do so. At about 3 p.m. on the 6 th January 1898, Sheikh Kasim Khan, Gitchki, who had been sent by me to Nasirabad, came in, together with Mir Khan, Mohamed Gazkandi, Bind of Aland, and Mir Alazar, Headman of Buledha, and took me, the party of the Kalat State troops, civil establishment, my family and families of the establishment to Kalatuk. About 1J miles from Turbat I was met by Mir Abdul Karim, Alir Sher Mohamed, Alir Shakrulla, Gitchkis. Some of our things had been saved, and as w r e could not take them with us to Kalatuk owing to want of carriage, they were left by Sheikh Kasim Khan in charge of Turbat Headmen. When Mir Shakrulla met us, ne was sen , Turbat to take care of the above things and to send them on to Kalatuk. He did this honestly, but while be was at Turbat, Mir Mehia .a an * g persuade him to join the rebels. After a few days Alir Baluch Khan, Naosherwani, who, ^ according to a previously concerted arrangement, ha e ? ctv joined Mebrab Khan at Turbat. Mir Mehrab Khan, Naosherwa and Mir Hyatan, Kind of Wakai, came in and assisted the reuu . ^j • * tt of TTnlnf'ik Sirrlnr Mir Morad of Tump, Mir Bahram During my stay at K.a . &gt; ’ , it-i nT Bizania, Mir Hussain Khan, Khan, Gitchki of Ivodiz, i ir 1 -j, Abdul Karim’s family, several Bizanjo, who had c “'?. e T 10 ,’, c’-n i. t cam e in with armed followers to help Headmen of Zamran, Mir Lalla of ® as cal ' e “ V 0 “ d the Tump forts, while me .

After Mir Baluch Khan, Naosherwani, joined with Mir Mehrab Khan m Tnrbat, the number of the latter’s followers increased day by day. and they l.oth ihreatened daily to attack us at Kalatuk. On the niglit or tne zan Tanunrv 1898 they name to Kalatuk with one thousand men, but returned to Turbat without fighting—probably because they had heard that Colonel Mayne s troops had left Pasni lor Kej* . _ , I would like to mention here, to show how utterly unprepared I was for this hostile action on the part of Mir Mehrab Khan, that the latter_ had visited me on the afternoon of the 5th January 1898, and we had a most friendly inter view. He talked to me about a dispute which I had to settle at Nasirabad, declared that Slier Mohamed, Gitchki, would not abide by any settlement I could make, and suggested that he should he given the work at Nasirabad. I promised to consider the question and to help him if I could. I asked him to help me to get a horse for my journey to Nasirabad, where I should find my camp and he offered me a seat on the camel he was then riding. He left me about G p.m. apparently pleased and friendly. r Losses of the Kalat State property during Mehrab Khan's disturbances. Serial No. Articles. Amount. Remarks. Rs. A.

Translation of the award of Mir Moosa Khan, ReJcizai, arbitrator in the case of Mir Sher Mohumed, Gitchki, versus Political Agent, Kalat. I have been appointed arbitrator in tbe question of the amount of damage done by tbe Government troops to tbe property of Sher Mobamed, Gitchki. According to your order I have enquired into tbe affair. As far as the goats are concerned, I have enquired from tbe people and Mir Sher Mobamed, who said that 122 goats have been slaughtered. I have settled that 60 goats at Us. 120 shall be paid for. Three donkeys have been killed and their price is fixed at Es. 30, A bull has been killed. It has been valued at Es. 10. The value of the Khasil (green wheat) is fixed at Es. 75. Eor the man who was killed I fix Es. 100 for this reason that, when 15 men of Colonel Beynold’s camp were killed by Mir Sher Mohamed in Gwadur, the blood-money was fixed at Es. 100 per man. On account of a silver hilted sword, I have fixed Es. 25 and for the silver Es. 10. The total amounts to Es. 370. Therefore I have reported accordingly for your information. appendix IV. The Rinds oE Hand have always been a difficult problem in the settlement of Makran.they were far superior to the Kinds in rank, position, civilization, etc. There will, however, he no objections to the grant of the sanad which I propose to ask His Highness now to grant to them, and I anticipate no difficulty in inducing His Highness to accept my recommendations. It will be seen that in my report I have advocated the location of a strong thana in Hand. I have selected the Bezenjos for this duty, as they possess great influence in Makran, being allied by marriage to the Gitchkisand owning considerable property in Kej and elsewhere. At the same time they have important interests nearer Quetta and Kalat, and it would not be difficult to bring pressure to bear on them if they misbehave. This thana, supplemented by a small subsidy, say Its. 100, to some of the leading Rinds, will, I hope, be amply sufficient to maintain the peace of the borderland complaints about Rind and Askani quarrels and Rind depredations in Persian territory should be things of the past. S. G. KNOX, Political Jgent, Kalat. Translation of sanad given hy Mir SJiahdad, Gitchfct, Nail of Rej, to the Rinds of Hand, dated 1 ri. lith February 1884 j±. D, Because in these times the sections of the Rinds which have enjoyed lands in Mand and Tump without paying Government taxes from old times have been exempt from payment of revenue in both districts—now also they are exempt. On the condition that they keep firmly the promise which they have written in the presence of the officer of the Government (may his magnifi cence continue) they will remain exempt. But if they turn away from the keeping of that promise, afterwards His Highness the Khan, Wali of Kalat, is the master, and whatever punishment he chooses to inflict in the imposition of revenue he has the power to do so. Therefore these few letters have been written by way of an agreement. This occurred on the 16th Kabi ul-Sani 1301 Hijra answering to the lith February 1881 A. D. Sndar Jam Ali Khan.

There has beea a great deal of talk and confusion about a sanad which it was said, had been given to the Bunds of Mand by Sir Robert Sandeman ’ This sanad has been produced and read in open durbar to-day, and it has been made clear that the sanad was only verified by Sir Robert Sandeman It is clear that the latter officer could not give away a revenue which did not belong to him, but was the property of His Highness the Khan. Sir Robert Sandeman only verified a document which was given to the Rinds by the Khan’s Isaib Shahdad. It has oyer and over again been ruled that sanads riven by the Khan’s Naibs are of no value, aud therefore this sanad is also valueless. Therefore it has been decided that for the present a new given to the Rinds in which I, the Political Agent, Kalat and sanad shall be .-v. —— — .u, xunuiucu Agem, i^uiat ana Bolan, and the Sirdars whose seals are below, promise to recommend to the Khan that the lands of the Binds, situated in Aland, shall be exempt from revenue so long as thev shall behave themselves and refrain from the committing of thefts and cut ting of telegraph wires, which have been so common in the past. If they offend in these resneets. thev will he made to nn.v ^pv^m-iA O I 7 ~ XXX these respects, they will be made to pay revenue. As regards the lands which have become the property of the Binds in Dasht, Tump and elsewhere, by marriage or otherwise within recent times, the Rinds have claimed to have these also exempted from revenue. It is nowhere the custom in Baluchistan that lands which have formerly paid revenue to the Khan become exempt merely because by accident they have come into the hands of persons who hold other lands which are exempt. This claim of the Rinds of Aland also has been found to cause a great deal of trouble in the collection of revenue from other people, and we shall not make any recommendation on this point, nor would it be advisable for His Highness the Khan to make any such remission. Finally, it must he borne in mind that this sanad is merely provisional and to be legal requires to be signed by His Highness the Khan whose signature we will endeavour to obtain.

I agree that I am responsible for the conduct of the various members of the Naosherwani family that they do not encroach on the proper ty of others or forcibly acquire possessions in Makran or any other part of His Highness the Khan’s dominions. 2 . I recognise the justice of the punishment inflicted on the Naosherwanis who took part in the late rising in Makran to wit that all their rights and property of every description in Makran has been forfeit ed to His Highness the Khan.3. 4. 5.

My Government pav and all the estates aforesaid are security for my respecting these conditions which I have agreed to. I further promise that no Naosherwani shall acquire any fresh lands in any part of Makran in any manner whatever unless he first obtain the formal written consent both of the Agent to the Govern or-General and His Highness the Khan of Kalattothe acquisition, X cleaily understand that any possessions or acquisi tions which have not been consented to by the Agent to the Governor-General and His Highness the Khan will never be recognized as lawful, and that it is my duty to inform the British Government and His Highness of any attempt to defeat this con dition. 6 . In conclusion as the strict enforcement of these conditions will he difficult for me, I request that the British Government will be pleased to allow me to deal with the members of my own tribe in regard to this matter in my own fashion, and that no complaints of any harsh measures rendered necessary for the strict enforcement of these conditions will be entertained by the Agent to the G ov ernor-General.

No. 1562, dated the -M. July 1898. nth ^ From—The Political Agent in Kalat, To—The Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. As verbally directed, I have the honour to submit a report showing the present situation of affairs in Makran and a short sketch of such events as have taken place since the Eield Eorce left the country. 2. I regret the general uncertainty that characterizes the report. This uncertainty is due to the fact that the reports of Naib Mir Abdul Karim, Gitchki, and of the native officers of the Kalat State troops, and certain private letters, the only means of information at my disposal, are extremely vague and contradictory. 3 . Erom these I gather that, about the middle of May last, Mir Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, accompanied by Mir Shah Nawaz Khan and Muhammad Umar, Nausherwanis, invaded Kej with a force, variously estimated at from one to'three thousand men. The Nausherwani following was chiefly composed of Damanis and Bamanis, hill tribes from over the Persian border, and formed the main part of the expedition. 4/ The attention of the Persian Government should, I think, be called to the conduct of these tribes and to the general question of refugees that take shelter in Persian territory, and thence lead expeditions composed of Persian subjects against country under British protection. As a matter of fact, the Damanis and Bamanis are beyond Persian control, and the question of these two tribes will have to he faced sooner or later, both for the sake of Makran and of the new trade route through Nushki. __ 5 Though it stayed in Kej only a few days, the expedition, according to ali accounts! S consider'able'damage The ™ Kalatuk, where Naib Mir Abdul Karim, Gitchki, lives.

Naib Abdul Karim, Gitchki, reported the occurrence from Kej by telegram and said that Kaoda Muhammad Khan was ready to give up he fort at my orders. I at once telegraphed back that he was to deliver up the fort at once and come peaceably to Quetta, where the matter would be enquired into. 10 Mir Hasil Khan, son of Sardar Allahyar Khan, Kustomzai, left Quetta* on the 3 rd June 1898, and I have received a telegram saying that he has reached Baho in Persia and has seen Mir Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, who refuses to come in except to a British officer. I propose to reply that Hasil Khan should induce Mehrab Khan to promise to refrain from disturbances in Kej until December, when a British officer, to whom Mir Mehrab Khan can tender his submission, is sure to be in IVXakian. H qq ie absence of news about the present movements of the Naushir- wanis induces me to believe that they also have retired to the Persian hills, A rumour reached me that Naib Yar Muhammad, Umrari Sardar of Chambor, had been killed in a fight with Mir Muhammad Umar, Naushirwani. The report is now over a fortnight old and since it has not been confirmed, and news, both from Kej and Panjgur, is silent on the subject, I do not credit it. As far as my information goes, Kolwa has remained perfectly quiet. 12. Lastly, we come to the attitude of that very mysterious character, Sardar Sir Nauroz Khan, K.C.I.E., the Naushirwani Chief. He planned the Damani raid; he is building a fort on the Mash Khel river, in which he can take refuge from the vengeance of the British Government; he has been promised unlimited land in Afghanistan and is going to take advan tage of the concession ; he has told his son to look after Kharan, to which he does not intend to return ; he has heard that the British Government know of his duplicity in connection with the Makran rising is in deadly terror, and nothing will induce him to come into Quetta or even to Kharan. These are a few of the reports that the ingenious inhabitants of the coun try are spreading about. They agree in little else except that Nauroz Khan is hostile to the British and will not come in to Quetta. His absence is of no great importance, except that it postpones indefinitely any such agreement as is proposed in my report No. 921 B., dated the 6 th May 1898. 13. If Nauroz Khan does not come in before the Political Agent, Kalat, starts on his Makran tour next year, Kharan should be the first place visited hy him. I have decided not to pay the monthly subsidy to the Sardar’s men, until the Sardar himself comes in, and I would respectfully venture to sug gest the advisability of your addressing the Sardar, asking from him a clear expression of his intentions and when he means to reach Quetta or Kalat,- V’ He has been ordered to come m to Quetta and does not show any intention of doing so. It would be as weil f the letter were sent by a special“ who should be directed to take it to the Sardar himself and not to return without a reply.

I met him again on the 20tli instant, and, in reply to my questions, the Sardar said that he would not go to Quetta at present, as he was afraid of the Sarkar. He said that he had surrendered Shahdad to Government, who had promised to release him in five months’ time, while he has been in prison for about four years. For this reason he could not see his way to come to Quetta. He, however, said he would be willing to meet the Political Agent, Kalat, Mir Shams Shah or any other European officer, either in Kej or Panjgur, if he were informed of the date and place of their arrival, and would talk matters over. He added that, if the Sarkar did not agree to this, he would send one of his repre sentatives, with papers, along with myself, to Quetta to negotiate for him. He said that he would never agree to Abdul Karim Khan being allowed to con tinue as Naib (of Kej), nor to Diwan TJdho Has as Nazim of Makran. If these officials were not dismissed, he would refuse to come in to Panjgur at all to see any officer. If Government, he said, were to remove them from their offices, he would hold himself responsible for Kej, and in that case there would be no necessity to station troops there. I offered to remain here (as a hostage) while he went to Quetta to arrange matters, but he refused to agree to this plan.

To Sie WILLIAM CUNINGHAM, k.c.s.i., Secretary to the Government of India, Colonel HENRY WYLIE, c.s.i., Officiating Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. Foreign Dept. cuAiijA, ine &lt;nci August 1898. Sir, I am directed to reply to your letters, as marked in the margin No. 3389 dated the 17 th May 1898. concerning affairs in Makran. In these 938 z 2,st July letters and their enclosures you have giveu a sketch of the condition of Makran previous to the late rising, an account of the causes which led to the disturbance and recommendations for the future. 2 . To deal first with recent arrangements in Makran and the causes of the disturbances, it seems to the Government of India that Dewan Udho Dass, the Khan of Kalat’s ISazim, went much further in getting into his own hands the entire administration of the country than the Khan ever proposed, or the Government of India, in lending his services to the Khan, ever intended. When His Highness asked for the services of Dewan Udho Dass, it was in order that he might superintend the work of the Khan’s Naibs of Kej, Panjgur and Kolwa, who were ordered to work under him. These Naibs were not responsible for the whole administration, which is, on the contrary, supposed to be conducted by the tribal Sardars, and which can in no other way be carried on in accordance with Brahui custom. The Nazim seems not only to have laid aside the Khan’s Naibs, but to have called upon the leading men of Kej to pay revenue, although they had been formerly charged by the Naibs with the duty of collecting it; and he also seems to have usurped the authority of the Sardars themselves. It is not to be wondered at that, in these circumstances, he incurred a measure of unpopularity great enough in itself to cause a rising of the people against him. 3. The disturbances are said also to have been due to discontent aroused by two decisions given by the Agent to the G overnor-General of the day against Mir Baluch Khan, Naosherwani, and Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, besides the mal contents gained confidence from the general feeling of unrest on the bordei, and from a belief that the British were soon to be driven into the sea. 4. The complete manner in which local disturbers of the peace were routed by the small body of troops under the able leadership of Lieutenant-Colonel R. 0. G. Mayne, Commanding the 30th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry, must ha^e dispelled this last illusion. The other causes of discontent cannot, however, fail to be associated, m the minds of the Sardars and tr be men of Makran, with successive acts of interference by the Butish power. S As von are aware, the Government of India, after very careful con- ddin ofSTwhol.the British Government by making itself responsible, m a greater or less decree for the administration of the country, could contribute to its prosperity and peace. That does not, however, exhaust the reasons for and against inter vention. The work of administration cannot be undertaken without an extension of responsibility which is not measured by the expenditure in men and monev necessary to keep internal order, but by other and far-reaching considerations of Imperial policy which are beyond the purview of the local officer. The Government of India find no evidence of the rapid advance southwards of foreign emissaries, which is put forward by you as one reason for active interference; but, even if the fact were admitted, they are not satis fied that the disturbing influences apprehended could be most effectually counteracted in the manner which you advocate. 6 . The Government of India would welcome the introduction of an efficient administration based on the system of Brahui Sardarships, and this is indeed the direction in which they have always desired to work. By this they do not mean a system of government by the Khan’s Naibs, which is not the system of the country; nor can they contemplate favourably a return to the former plan of government by local Sardars with the Khan’s Naibs supposed to watch His Highness’s interests—neither side being guided or controlled; for that would inevitably mean a return to the old state of disorder and abuses, intensified in all probability. The Governor-General in Council thinks, therefore, that some endeavour should still be made to adopt the Brahui system of administration by Sardars and Naibs combined with a representative of the Khan to superintend the latter and advise the whole. The selection of Dewan Udho Dass to fill the position of Nazim has not been fortunate ; but there is still reason to hope that, with a judiciously selected officer, who might preferably perhaps be a Muham madan, better results could be obtained. The Nazim should have no direct hand in the administration and collection of the revenue. He should be responsible to the Khan of Kalat that the levies are paid, and that the Naibs do their duty and account for the revenue collected, and he should keep His Highness informed of what goes on in the districts under his supervision. 7. One of the first measures to be adopted is the abolition of the infantry of the Kalat re-organized troops. It is clear that various circumstances, and especially the manner in which they have been raised and recruited, have prevented this body of men from being regarded as ‘ the Khan’s troops,’ although they are so called and are maintained at the cost of His Highness. “They look entirely to the British officer who raised them for pay and orders, and are really a body of troops loyal only to us, and are viewed by the Khan and his Naibs with distrust and dislike.” The employment of such a body of troops in Makran is m effect British interference and occupation, disguised by their name, and bv their up-keep being defrayed by the Khan, but none the less really entailing that very responsibility which the Government of India have desired to evade. The system under which they have been employed has the further disadvantage tL™ rplVfr a 16 res P°^ lblllt y of fhe Government of India without affording t ^. lealf /^ domof . actlon - Tho abolition of the infantry will involve the abolition of the appointment of military adviser to the Khan of Kalat. out, f lpln^\-t h k , ?i 1 1 , lt i i i straetllattlle / e ‘ 0r§anized troops should be got rid of with- out delay, it is equally necessary to put something in their place Your nro- PaniguTand to'e'onvrrt tWn 0 f t ? blished in ‘hanas at Hand, Bolida and cS 8 The Gove^nrTen ! r ra,m ! 1 ca “ elr 3 r into a tribal leVy under a tL right directloTw 1 11 1 £° U w bell , eTes ^at this would be working in can safely he left to f n i ,, r !f T' • i ln '' t, i:d bbe possibility of the latter measure Care TsUe teLT-n TL ° • ldC1 T, tl ° n 38 y° l,r l )ro P osed sch eme develops, the re-organized infantrv mvpaTT i lf r a PP cal ’ ance of military strength which Kalat’sSorhy ^Trnor Genemn'r”-, 0 ' the o£ the conversion of the eaniel corns he T t TT W ? uld Wlsh to Ieara how would cost.

His Excellency in Council would however, if possible, dispense with a tour of any British officer and cannot regard any settlement of the local administration as satisfactory ’ which will require repeated tours of the kind. ^ 10 . In the conclusion of your letter first cited, you ask that existing arrange ments should he allowed to continue for seven or eight months, and that, in the meantime, yon may he allowed to make arrangements for the introduction of the form of government which yon have sketched. It is, in the opinion of the Governor-General in Council, inevitahle that the present system should con tinue until next autumn, and that the interval should he utilized in maturing plans for the future. The various considerations stated in this letter indicate the objects to which attention ought now to he directed, namely, the introduction of a local Brahui administration, with the Khan of Kalat’s interests efficiently safeguarded by the nomination of Naibs, who will really act on his behalf and who will be supervised by a representative of the Khan, supported by levies taken from the people of the country and main tained at the expense of the Khan. This can only he brought about, if at all, by strengthening the local Sardars against Naosherwani encroachment, and enabling them to administer without relying on, or dreading, as the case may he, the continual interference of the British power. 11. It is observed in the enclosures to your second letter that Mr.. Knox is informed that Mir Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, invaded Kej last May, with the assistance of Damanis and Bamanis from the Persian side of the border. It is said that these people are beyond Persian control, but a recommendation is made to the effect that the attention of the Persian Government should he called to their conduct. It does not seem to the Government of India that any benefit can he expected from calling the attention of the. Persian Government to these tribes, unless the British Government is ready to insist on Persia bring ing them under control. In the present state of the Makran districts on this side of the boundary, the Government of India are not m a strong position lor making any such representation. 12. The Governor-General in Council agrees with you that Lieutenant Knox deserves credit for the manner in which he has performed his work. He is young to have been placed in so responsible a position and he has shown himself to be a capable officer. It should be reportedwhat steps are being ^a^en or what progress has been made towards realizing ie &lt; rewards ordered by Lieutenant Knox, and what expen i ure conspicuously how it was met, and whether he adequately rewar e good service in the late disturbances.

They appear in bad way : twenty-five sick, one killed, two wounded out of sixty, and ask for re-inforcements which Khan cannot furnish. I am sending Knox to Kalat and Gidar; he will raise and despatch tribal force to support Khan’s authority in Panjgur, for, if Kardar is killed or compelled to flee, we may expect general rising throughout Makran, as Kardar reports that general impression is that we have abandoned Makran. Sir Nauroz Khan is in Birjand too far off to assist, but his son, Yakub Khan, has been directed to recall his clansmen from Panjgur, and been warned that he is responsible for any harm they commit.

Wylie, C.S.I., Officiating Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a report on Panjgur affairs by Mr. Knox, No. 73 C., dated the 3rd instant. 2. Subsequently to the writing of that report, I received telegiam No. 1283 of yesterday’s date from the Political Agent in Southern Baluchis tan, and this morning I received the same officer’s telegram No. 1294 (copies attached), both bearing on the state of affairs in Panjgur. 3 . I had the honour of telegraphing to you yesterday the purport of the former message, and of briefly informing you of the steps I proposed taking to restore order in Panjgur. . . 4 You will see from former correspondence that the situation m Panjgur has rapidly 0 altered for the worse, and I will now try to explain what that ahuatUm w^,and wha™ ^ by name Sai id A bid Husain, who may be said to represent the is the ruler under the orders of He wan Kd'o Has, Nazim ot Ma ^ ^ Kaoda Muhammad Khan, the Nai . witlmHis Highness.

Moreover he was suppoi ^ t t J re see ms to have been that troops. The immediate cause of the pi“en .^P a small fort near Panjgur Kaoda Muhammad Khan was aira o Katdar seized the fort, whereupon a body of Naushirwams.

During this siege he held the small fort of Gam to have lost one man killed and two wounded of the Kalat Khan, and seems State troops. 6 . Knowing how unpopular Kaoda Muhammad Khan was with the people of Pani^ur, Mr. Knox considered that he would soon have to flee the district or surrender, and he despatched two Brahui “ Motibars” from here to recom mend him to come to Kalat, when he promised to enquire fully into tie matters in dispute between him and the Kardar, of which we know veiy little at present. The only reply to this message has been that Kaoda Muhammad Khan declined to surrender. 7. Prom the more recent telegrams which I attach to this report, it appears that Kaoda Muhammad Khan has now induced that section of the Naushirwanis which was actively engaged against us in Makran early this year to join him, and some of these have thrown themselves into his fort of Isai, while others are advancing from various directions on Panjgur, which district they will probably loot. Meanwhile the Kardar seems to be in a bad way, for the Kalat State troops are suffering much from sickness, and his Baluchi friends do not appear to be trustworthy. He reports that the general idea is that we mean to give up interfering in Makran, and consequently all those, who are averse to the form of government which are established, there under the Nazim, will unite in endeavouring to upset it. Indeed if the Kardar is killed, or compelled to flee from Panjgur, I think we must expect a general rising in Makran, and this idea is confirmed by messages I have just received from Mir Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, who declines to come to Quetta, or to keep quiet until next cold weather. 8 . I am taking the following steps to quell the disturbance in Panjgur, which I hope will meet with the approval of the Government of India. I am writing to Mir Yakub Khan, Naushirwani, who, in the absence of his father, Sir Nauroz Khan in Persia, is managing Kharan affairs, directing him to recall his clansmen from Panjgur, and warning him that he will be held responsible if they commit any depredations in that district. I am sending Mr. Knox to Kalat to see the Khan, and ascertain what his wishes and views are. I am suggesting to His Highness that a tribal force shall be rafsed for temporary service, and despatched under its own leaders, to support the Kardar and restore order in Panjgur. Mr. Knox will proceed as far as Gidar to see that this force (which there will be no difficulty in raising) is efficient, but I do not propose that he shall accompany it to Panjgur. This force would be paid from Makran revenues. Mr. Knox will be accompanied by a Bombay Cavalry escort of 30 sabres, which should be sufficient for his personal safety. 9. The only other method of re-establishing order in Panjgur would be to despatch a column of our own troops there, and this could hardly be done at this season of the year, although I think that Government must contem plate sending a strong escort with the Political Agent of Kalat through Makian next winter, whatever may be the future policy decided upon towards that tract.

Only one plan suggests itself to me for the quelling of this disorder, and that would be for myself, accompanied by a strong tribal escort, to proceed immediately to Panjgur. I could reach Panjgur within 20 days of receipt of orders. This would probably check the Naushirwani raiding at all events and would, to a certain extent, restore confidence in Makran. * 60 Sowars at Rs. 25 per mensem 5 Motibars averaging Rs. 70 Miscellaneous expenses ...

At present it would he difficult to meet these expenses from the Makran revenues, but the charge would, if necessary, be met later, partly from Makran revenues and partly from the Khan’s interest money.

Under-Secretary. It has been admitted generally that the presence of a competent officer at Kertnan is greatly needed for the protection of British interests, both commercial and political. This want was for a time supplied by the appointment of Lieutenant Sykes as Consul at Kerman. No pay was attached to the post, but Lieutenant Sykes received £2SO a year as office allowance. This arrano'ement lasted about two years, and now at its termination Her Majesty s Government lesire, with a view to- the revival of the arrangement, that the Government of India may consider the question of the payment of a contribution from Indian revenues towards the ex penses of a Consular establishment at Kerman. It is said in the lastenclosure to the despatch below that the post of Consul at Kerman was created f&lt; in consequence of the earnest and repeated representa ions ma 6 7 61 i-Rjes y Diplomatic and Consular representatives in Persia as to the necessity of ;o the numerous British Indian subjects trading in Persian Baluchistan, Md as to the impo t »t political and commercial interests involved. ’ Such being the cas «- mry see no reason to continue the allowance paid unless the Indian Government is prepared ;o contribute at least half the cost of the establishment. _ , r t TKa nf State in referring the matter for the consideration of the Government &gt;f India^ ^ys^reat^tress^ 'o'n the importance, in ^hj’interest^of^India, )f observing political and commercial movemen s in p ^ ^ C(m _ ransit to Afghanistan.^ It also appears to is . n ^ J rse i n fl uenC es which may be mlar Agent in Kerman may be useful m e ® u ' J | B ^ trade in this region.” n ought to bear against the development of Butah and British 1 of £ , 50 a The arrangement under which Lieutenant Syto ^eoive^au^offiee^ ^ one which any 7 ear for conducting the Consular duties at erman fj er Majesty^ Minister at successor can scarcely he expected to ^ ssen °' . , office allowance mUht be put at Pehran recently proposed that the outlay f^.^ ^S^Tare not to exceed this sum, 5500 a year. If the expenses of the Consu a question then arises—will the he Government of India would be expected to pay half. 0 Government of India consent to pay t ls •the Government of India distinctly declined to make any allotment for it. But while this is so as regards the Kerman Consulate, the Government of India are interested in the opening of a British Agency or Consulate at Bunder Abbas. There is, however, this to be noted that no final decision has yet been arrived at as regards the latter question, the consideration of which will be resumed when the normal conditions of the trade of Bunder Abbas have been restored by the withdrawal of the Russian sanitary restrictions which have interfered with the overland trade. When the Consulate was first opened, Secret E., July 1894, Nos. 110-111. Proceedings No. 26 of Secret E., July 1896, Nos. 19-28. Proceedings No. 153 of Secret E., June 1897, Nos. 150- 153. If the question of Consular representation at Bunder Abbas is shortly to be taken up again, and an officer is eventually appointed to that post, it will help to settle the other ques tion as to the payment by the Indian Government of a moiety of the cost of the Kerman Con- , ., , n v w sulate; for the two questions are connected— This may be considered Colonel Yates proposal, but . , , i o -.1 backed by‘Colonel Wilson-Proceedings Nos. 23 in that the proposal Originally put forward by and 26 of Secret E., July 1896, Nos. 19-28. the Persian Gulf Residency was that the Con sul at Kerman should also hold charge of Bunder Abbas. If the two charges are held by the same officer, much of the objection to the Indian Government paying a moiety of the cost of the Kerman (Consulate will have been overcome. Finance Department for consideration and remarks. The two questions may be dealt with together and brought up again when the plague restrictions have been removed. Mean while it is to be decided what reply should be sent to the Secretary of State as to the Indian contribution on account of the Kerman Consulate. F. A. deB.— 10th December 1897. R. W 0 December 1897. Deputy Secretary. 1. As a precaution against Russian activity in Kain and Seistan, it was proposed in 1894 to establish British Agencies in South-Eastern Persia. Secretary noted that, “if we could afford to establish a Consul for Kerman and Bunder Abbas, I think that, both politically and com mercially, the results would be very good.” W T e did not know how to find the money, and so we refused to contribute. Moreover, it Secret E., July 1894, Nos. 110-111. was noted at the ti . me that “ mone y would b 6 better spent on a Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas, where there was a large British Indian trade,” securable f&lt; at Rs. 50 a month.” 2. Since that date we have the following:— (i) Lieutenant Sykes went to Kerman as Consul in 1894. We have heard complaints of oppressive treatment received during his absence by British Secret E., Proceedings, November 1894, No. 112. Indian sub J e Cts at Kerman and Bunder Abbas. Secret E., Proceedings, September 1895, Nos. 107-115. (ii) Sir Mortimer Durand wrote from the Embassy at Tehran on the 20th Dec ember 1894:— “ I feel sure that the Government of India, to whom the maintenance of British influence in Persia is no doubt a matter of serious interest, will wish to do anything in their power to increase the efflciency of the new Consulate. I trust that, as Her Majesty’s Government has seen its way to establishing a Consulate at Kerman, the Government of India will not thinif the small expenditure involved in these proposals is an excessive contribution on the part of Indian Revenues.” The contribution asked was estimated in this oflSce at Rs. 255 exclusive of the initial expenditure on equipment, ete. His Excellency noted in reply ‘‘ 1 fail to find any reason for altering onr recorded opinion that we had no funds to spend on this Consulate, and if we had, we sJaould not spend them at Kerman.” (iii) Keitnan is at one end of a section of an important trade route inland. At the other end is Bunder Abbas, also an important centre of British Indian trade. In K VVs., Secret E., November 1897, Nos. 150-153. 1895 the export and import . trade with British India and the Colonies amounted to over 41 and 75 lakhs respectively. t) e /r 006 an&lt; ^ ^ ommerce Department can say how small a proportion of this trade is with Ihe volume of trade is great, but the number of traders is believed to be small. ,iv) In August 1895 it was proposed to tack on Bunder Abbas to Kerman. The pro Secret E., Proceedings, July 1896, Nos. 19-28. pOSal was negatived partly fron • i jt. r, „ T f ear l esb its acceptance wouh involve the Government of India in paying the cost without exercising a reason able amount of control over the appointment and expenditure.&gt; ( 3 ) the aWe^JonfwouLfblm: S I ' dia W0 ' ld ^ eU “ ed to chie£ cmtrol - (v) The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently been told that the appoint- Secret E., June 1897, Nos. 150-153. m enfc of a Consular Agent to »i' , . . watcli British interests at Bunder Aboas may become necessary m time, but from a commercial point of view he is not much needed at present :— “ The Government of India will be able to judge more definitely when the Russian sanitary cordon is with- drawn. The double appointment will create, it is anticipated, little inconvenience. But the total cost oould scarcely be less than Bs. 10,000 a year, though Sir Mortimer Durand estimates Page 4, K. Ws., Secret P., August 1894, Nos. 3-25. £500^ (or Us. 8,000). But his estimate does not include housing, etc. The Vice-Consul receives £350 at Mohammerah and £100 office allowance. Whether we will contribute or not, seems purely a question of funds. 3. It is for consideration whether the Bombay Government, the Agent to the Governor* General in Baluchistan and the Political Resident at Bushire should not be consulted, if Finance Department can find the money. I would remind Deputy Secretary that Major Meade has been complaining that the Imperial Treasury does not, in bis opinion, bear a fair share of the Bushire charges. We mio-ht fake this into consideration in replying, and demand a quid pro quo. If Foreign office give Rs. 250 out of £500 at Kerman, 1 don’t see why they should only give (say) £35 at Bushire. 10th December 1897. J. XiANG. Secretary, 1 am inclined to think that this matter might lie by for a bit until we see whether the enquiries and proceedings in connection with the murder of Mr. Graves are likely to m any way assist consideration of the future position in Persian Baluchistan. 2 Our letter to Mr. Sykes in External B, May 1895, No. 81, may he read.

The latter part of the telegram from the Secretary of State raises wide issues and may perhaps wait till the question about troops is decided. On the political aspect of the position in, and future of, Persian Baluchistan, we should get an opinion from Mr. Barnes. As to commercial interests and telegraph matters, we shall have to consult the Finance and Public Works Departments. In a recent despatch the Secretary of State has pressed the Government of India to reconsider the question of contributing to the cost of a Consul for Kerman. 28th December 1897. H. Daly. His Excellency. Yes, as to confining operation^ I do not quite follow why Meade should leave Jask ? E. I think the first thing is to instruct Colonel Meade to leave Jask and to confine any opera tions which he orders to the protection of Jask and Charbar. Next, to ask the Military Department if they can send 100 men for the protection of Charbar and 50 for the protection of Jask, and if those numbers will suffice; if not, what strength should be sent for the protection of the stations only and not of the land line. I cannot delay referring these questions to consider and note*, on the policy to be pursued if matters in Persian Baluchistan come to a crisis, but I think it must be evident that the Indian Government cannot undertake the military protection of Persian Baluchistan. 28lA December 1897. W. J. Cuningham. On the. latter point one thing to my mind is clear, i.e. t that it is useless to attempt an effective military intervention in, or at any rate occupation of, Persian Baluchistan with the forces now at the disposal of the Government of India, and though it may take time to ascertain to what extent our interests may be otherwise affected, I would say thus much in any reply to the Secretary of State. I confess I do not much like admitting the principle by sending the detachments now asked, and then small detachments in isolated positions are always objectionable. Still Jask and Charbar are, I believe, both on the sea coast, and we are bound, I suppose, to protect the Telegraph staff. It is for the Military Department and the Commander-in-Ghief to say what we can do, and I would ask their opinion urgently. 28th December 1897. t? Your Excellency. We are asked if wo can send 100 native infantry to Charbar and 50 to Jasb; these Map put up. P laces are on the coast, approximately 400 and b00 miles west of Karachi.

I take it from the above, that so far as trade is concerned, there is no great need for having Consular Agents in South-Eastern Persia. We ou^ht, therefore, for financial reasons, to object to any proposal that India should pay for such Agents for commercial objects. If the Foreign Department come to the conclu sion that political objects render the Agents desirable, we shall consider whether the financial considerations should give way. 4lA February 1898.

Shortly before this, in Secret despatch No. 37, dated the 29th October 1897, the Secre tary of State for India, on the motion of the Foreign Office, had re-opened the question of a contribution from Indian revenues towards the cost of a Consulate at Kerman. The Foreign Office observed—“ A British Consular post was established at Kerman in October 1894 in consequence of the earnest and repeated representations of Her Majesty's Diplomatic and Consular Representatives in Persia as to the necessity of affording protection to the numerous British Indian subjects trading in Persian Baluchistan, and as to the important political and commercial interests involved.' Lord George Hamilton said—“ I shall be obliged if Your Excellency’s Government will give your careful consideration to the matter, having regard not only to the arguments contained in the Foreign Office letter, but also to the importance, in the interest of India, of securing the means of observing political and commercial movements in this part of Persia, and on the lines of transit to Afghanistan. “ Xt further appears to me that the maintenance of a Consular Agent in Kerman may be useful in counteracting any adverse influences which may be brought to bear against the development of British and British Indian trade in this region. 3. On the 18th February 1898, the Secretary of State, referring to this despatch of the 29th October 1897, telegraphed— ■ '-sr Consulate.' The Viceroy replied o D the 23 rd February that f^iefeuTmo^dS 1898-99 half the cost of sending Captain Sykes back to K , P not exceed Rs. 6,000; but said , , • “ We are not prepared at present to give , final opinion - ^ h h.' 4.

Lord George Hamilton said in his despatch— “I trust that the suggestion of appointing Consular Agents at points along the trade route between Quetta and Meshed, may receive the attentive consideration of Your Excellency^ Government. It appears to me a measure desirable from many points of view, and especially in connection with the facilities which might be afforded by that route for the transport of arms and ammunition between the Persian Gulf and Baluchistan.” On the 31st March we sent home, with Secret despatch No. 58 (Frontier), papers relating to the development of trade between Baluchistan and Persia, and to the control of the desert tract between Nushki and Koh-i-Malik Siah. The despatch concluded by referring to the suggestion as to appointing Consular Agents at central points between Seistan and Meshed and promised a report in due course. 5. The history of the Kerman Consulate is briefly this :—In 1892, Lord Kimberley had c ..I? iw v. i qoq xr kco declared himself unable, “considering the large share already borne by India of the cost of Diplomatic and Consular representation in Persia,” to acquiesce in a proposal, put forward by the Foreign Office at the instance of Sir F. Lascelles, to create, “ at the entire charge of the Indian Government,” a single Vice-Consulship for Yezd and Kerman. In 1893 Captain (then Lieute nant) Sykes was permitted to proceed “ on leave ” to Kerman upon an invitation which he had received from the Farman Farma, who was then Governor-General of Kerman. Lieutenant Sykes subsequently went to Tehran and England, and about the end of 1894, he returned to Kerman as Consul. He received no pay, but the Foreign Office gave him an office allowance of £250 a year. The Government of India declined to contribute. His appointment was for two years. He returned to England about a year ago, and came out to the Persian Gulf last autumn on a mission connected with the measures taken to check the arms trade. He has now, as shown above, gone back to Kerman as Consul at the joint charge of the Home and Indian Governments.

To this end ^ n J ea 1 sures which Colonel Murdoch Smith advocates seem to me entirely desirable. What he proposes is in effect that we should restore the state of affairs formerly existing by which we had capable military officers scattered about Persia in connection with the Telegraph Department, and that we should utilise the services of these officers as Political Agents, letting them move freely about the country and make friends with the people and Chiefs. The pay of the officers appointed would be little higher in the aggregate than the pay of the existing telegraph establishment, and their appointment would create no apprehen sion, as they would be simply telegraph officers—with no ostensible consular of diplomatic powers;” Lord Roberts :—“ By reviving the military organisation of the Persian Telegraph Depart ment, we should increase our influence in Persia; we should provide an admirable school at a trifling cost for the stamp of men whose services would be most useful in the event of troubles with Russia; we should obtain better information of what is going on and we should know more of the military resources of the country “ Every means should be taken to strengthen our influence in Persia, and nothing can do this more effectually than locating selected British officers at certain places and bringing British produce and British money into the country.” Sir Theodore Hope “ I fear that the real truth is that we can now do very little to strengthen our influence in Persia, and that if war came, we do not possess the means of operating there on the Russian flank in addition to what we should be forced to do in other quarters. There is in my opinion no real basis for influence except strength, and that we do not and cannot possess in this quarter « As to the telegraph officers becoming semi-politicals, I do not see any objection to this or any difficulty in the arrangement being made compatible with the contemplated reorganisation of the Indo-European Telegraph Department (if that measure be determined on).” Sir Auckland Colvin :—I think Persia lies outside our ring fence : and that as we cannot hope to maintain any position which we may assume there, we should mos carefully avoid the discredit of compulsory retreat from any position which we may be led into assuming. I think it should be our aim to be on the most friendly terms Irith the Persian Court; and to aim at opening up, so far as any eneourage- -nt which can be given to private r Perl* country.

A despatch followed on the 24th June 1887 which contained the following: — “ In respect to the general policy to be pursued towards Persia, we entirely agree with Your Lordship's opinion that it is expedient and important to strengthen British influence in that country We do not conceal from ourselves that the geographical position of Russia, her energetic policy, and the rapid development of her military resources in the east, have given her great power at Tehran; and it seems improbable that any exertions on our part could now regain for us the position which we once held at the Court of the Shah. But we believe that something may yet be done to prevent, or at least to retard, the complete subjection of Persia to Russian domination, and to preserve for ourselves a measure of influence which may be of material advantage to us hereafter. We also realise the importance of opening up Persia to British enterprise. Having these objects in view, we should regard with satisfaction any steps calculated to gain for us the good-will and confidence of the Shah and his people, and to place us in more close and cordial relation with them. We have already endeavoured by stationing a British officer in Eastern Persia to strengthen our position in that part of the country; and we think that an effort should now be made, not only to revive our influence with the Persian Government, but also, and more especially, to obtain some practical hold over the Southern and Western Provinces, where Russia has at present made little way. In certain eventualities, these mountainous tracts, inhabited by brave and hardy tribes, might afford us a very valuable field of action. With regard to the last point, we are of opinion that the proposals of Colonel Murdoch Smith, relating to telegraph arrangements in Persia, are of much importance We are unanimous in thinking that the development of communication in Persia, with British aid and guidance, is in itself desirable.' (ii) Secret E., August 1897, Nos. 433-434, contains a letter from the India Office to tne Foreign Office of the same date (the 24th June 1887) as the above despatch from the Government of India. This letter says— Viscount Cross considers it to be desirable, in the commercial as well as the political interests of British India, that a commanding influence in Southern and Central Persia should be secured for the English Government. The object is of importance at the present time, but it is likely to become of much more importance as the position of Russia on the North-West Frontier of India becomes more developed.' (nil Secret E„ July 1889, Nos. 97-115, contains papers relating to railway projects m and near Persia, Lord Lansdowne telegraphed to the Secretary of State on the 20th January 1889— “ Extension through Baluchistan is regarded by military authorities here as most valuable adjunct to defences of India, and as deserving of utmost encouragement • but our concurrence should be conditional on adoption of our gauge and on location of line in accordance with our requirements.' id’uV” S &lt;r e i- E ' : Se A4 emb f l 883 ’ Nos ' WS-US, is a letter, dated the 2ud July ^88 .from the horeign Office to the Treasury about the grant of a Charter to the new I ersian Bank, in which Lord Salisbury's opinion is thus stated “Thecollapseofthiseoncessionwould, on political grounds, be a serious evil. Persia stands at this moment at a very critical point in her history. If no development of her resources can be accomplished, decay, which for seieral generations past s set in can only be expected to continue, and her absorption by a powerful military neighbour can only be a question of years. On the other hand P if her wealth and prosperity can be increased, if advantage can be taken of her o-real atura capabilities, and above all, if communications with the sea and with India by railway can be established, the difficulties in the way of a Russian subjugation will be largely increased; and if sufficient interval for th£ accomplishment of that „ owth can be obtained the danger will probably be dispelled altogether If the railways are made Persia will be able to fight for herself, and may obtain friends If af^ader!' ^ 316 ^ mUS ‘ ^ ^“‘“eyt 15 ] (v) Secret E., June 1891, Nos. 171-181 is full of ;„t„ o r ra'lway schemes, including memoranda written in October r8?g Pape / S n a I'l n0tes about Sir Henry Brackenbury, when Director of Mint., t , J,. 9 ani1 Oetober 1890 by Sir Edwin Collen noted in November 1890—“Speaking fn t* tbe War Office, say that the project for a railway from BalS™ to sS DepM 1 a great strategical victory.'

I concur with what he has written, and I am convinced that a sudden access of activity on our part would lead to corresponding activity in railway development on the part of Russia. Our policy is to obtain as much knowledge as we can of the routes along which we may ultimately be compelled to construct lines of railway.” It was practically settled that a reconnaissance for a line to Nushki should be made ; but when the case went to the Finance Department, Sir David Barbour asked what this was to lead up to and said —“ If it is intended to make this reconnaissance the starting point for a railway towards the Helmand, or the Persian frontier, I think the whole case should be put forward and considered before any further steps are taken.” The case was then brought up in Council on the 21st May 1891 and the order was—“No further action required regarding reconnaissance.” 8. Before examining later papers, I will give here a few extracts from the Hon’ble G. N. Curzon^s ‘ Persia/ which was published in 1892 :— “ Seistan presents to Russia a positive and a negative value should she at any r, t _ OOQ time find it politic or necessary to Yol. I, pages 6- . absorb Khorassan, the possession of Seistan would give her the whole, and not the northern portion only, of that province Russia in Khorassan means Russia at Herat; and Russia in Seistan would mean Russia at Sebzewar and Farrah as well, the two most important strategical points on the march from Herat to Kandahar. “ I do not for a moment lay stress upon the other aspect of the positive value to Russia of Seistan— viz., as facilitating her approach to the Southern Seas—because I assume that a Russian port upon the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean would no more be tolerated by any English Minister or Government than would an English port on the Caspian by any Czar The negative value of Seistan to Rufsia is the inverse aspect of its positive value to Great Britain. In other words, Russia would like to get hold of Seistan herself, in order to prevent Seistan from W got hold of by Great Britain; and because, in the latter event, not only wouffi the ambitious andfor-reaehing schemes that I have sbet f ad b ? b //^/ England would be in a / rival The adianta ewi \r or th Eastern Persia with her manufactures, enables Russia to flood the markets -n the bazars of Meshed and to undersell her sole competitor, g VeD terms with her The one means by which the latter could comp 7 railway 0 n the 'l^o'mal’if MnXii ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ Such a Railway starting from India must point, as its first objective, to Seistan. starting trom rnu a r ’ .. ... t j think be denied, as bringing a°flanklng positio/in defenciTofthat Afghan°territory which she has undertaken “ The potential ^sources'of Seistan and the uses of ^s Yol.

The Vol. II, 597. movements ... along the south and east borders of Khorassan, the activity of her agents in regions far beyond the legitimate radius of an influence restricted to North Persia, her tentative experi ments in the direction of Seistan—are susceptible of no other interpretation than a design to shake the influence of Great Britain in Southern Persia, to dispute the control of the Indian Seas, and to secure the long-sought base for naval operations in the east. This can only be accomplished in either of two directions—by a war with Turkey and the capture of Baghdad, or by a semi-peaceful advance through Persia to the Gulf “We may make it certain that, whatever destiny befall her in the north, in regions Yol. II, pages 620-621. beyond the sphere of our possible interference, Persia shall retain in violate the centre and south and be able to say to an invader, f thus far and no further/ British ascendency, commercial and political, in the southern zone is the only means by which this aim can be secured. A line can be drawn across Persia from Seistan. on the east, via Kerman and Yezd, to Ispahan, and prolonged westward to Burujird, Hamadan and Kermanshah, south of which no hostile political influence should be tolerated/'’ 9. In 1894, Colonel Yate, then Officiating Agent to the Governor-General at Meshed, sent in Secret F., August 1894, Nos. 3-25. some papers relating to Russian intrigues in Seistan. The case was fully noted on by Mr. Clarke. Sir George White was of opinion that “ it would be unsound military policy to contemplate and prepare for separate operations in Seistan/’ J Sir Henry Brackenbury referred to the memoranda* he had written at the War Office and * See paragraph 7(v) above. said— ' AM Colonel Ante’s proposals are based on the supposition that we want to push forward into Seistan... I hold that both from a military and a political point of view such an advance would be a grave error. I regret that we have me died so much m Seistan.

In any case the proposal must be held over until the normal conditions of trade have been restored by the withdrawal of the Russian sanitary cordon. ’ The Foreign Office list for 1898 shows the following consular appointments in Persia m addition to those at Tehran, Bushire and Meshed, (the appointments at the last two places are held by officers of our Political Department) : — Tabriz—Consul-General—(pay £650+ £270 office allowance).

At No. 215 in Secret E., November 1896, Nos. 214-223, is an important despatch from Sir Mortimer Durand to Lord Salisbury, regarding the then existing condition of affairs in Persia, which includes the following :— “ At present our merchants naturally consider that an Englishman’s life is not safe at Shuster The only way, so far as I can see, to establish security for the future and to let our trade develop from this natural centre, is to appoint a Resident Vice-Consul under the protection of a trustworthy armed force. That force, I think, might take the form of an escort of Indian troops, but it would, in my opinion, be much better on all accounts to raise at the expense of the Persian Government a body of Bakhtiaris and Arabs under British officers. It will be remembered that the Russians have an armed force under Russian officers at Tehran itself. They could not logically object to our having a similar force in the south, and the Persian Government, if resolutely pressed, would, I believe, agree “ Moreover the consequences would not be wholly unpleasant to them. The Persian Government would not like paying for the corps, and they would not hke the trouble of overcoming possible Russian opposition; but, on the other hand, they could make some reduction in their existing force, and they know that abodyot trustworthy troops under British officers would give the Central Government a firm hold in the province where it was quartered A hrce ecpnvzhnt to a single regiment would, I believe, amply suffice for Shuster and the neighbourhood ..... “ Such a force would be a nucleus for the extension of our influence among the Bakhtiaris and Arabs and, if we ever desired to extend the system, the foundation would have been laid/ A similar corps could at any time be raised m Ispahan, where the Zil-es-Sultan would, I feel sure, be delighted to see it. it also means some expense means some expense Tom-selves; andR^ay X” ifal pTbeUevedTot of' Consulates in Ispahan, Shiraz have nroposed might accelerate her and Bushire; and any suon ^I 1 , “U. of this Legation, I think we movements.

The Foreign Office letter received with the despatch of the 2nd December 1897, specially drew attention to the loss suffered by British trade in the regions near Meshed through Russian competition. The plague and the precautionary measures adopted have, of course, operated as a check on Indian exports, and the activity which the Russians have displayed in connection with plague precautions will not be forgotten. On the 22nd January c T non* XT 1897, Sir Nicholas O'Conor reported from St. Secret F., June 1897, Nos. 1-77. t&gt;xi i. ir • i. * t i. n retersburgh— Count Kapmst spoke to me a few days ago of the fears generally entertained here that the Indian Government was not disposed to adopt sufficiently stringent regulations to stay the progress of the disease and prevent its spreading from Bombay to the Persian Gulf, as well as to other places' Our Ambassador forwarded at the same time a precis of an article in the Russian ‘Official Gazette,' dated January 4th-16th, 1897, which contained the following :— “ In order to obtain timely information respecting the advance of the plague towards Russian Central Asiatic territories, Medical Officers will be despatched to the ports of Bender Bushire and Bender Abbas, in the Persian Gulf, as also to Kerman and Yezd in the interior of Persia. None will be sent to Tehran and Meshed, as there are Russian Doctors already there Similarly no Doctor need be stationed at Sabzwar in view of the proximity to Meshed.' On the 18th January 1897, four days before Sir Nicholas O'Conor's report. Sir Secret F., June 1897, Nos. 87-150. Mortimer Durand, in addressing Lord Salis bury about plague precautions, said— “ The Residency Surgeon himself supervises the quarantine at Bushire, and the Indian Government has placed under his orders Military Assistant Surgeons for the ports of Lingah and Bunder Abbas, about which the Russian authorities of Trans- Caspia have shown such anxiety. Your Lordship is probably aware that caravan routes run from these ports to the north of Persia, and the Russian authorities have, I believe, gone so far as to propose the deputation of Russian Doctors not only to Lingah and Bunder Abbas, but also to Yezd and Kerman. I do not think the Persian Government intend to accept this proposal.' Two months later (18th March 1897) Mr. Hardinge forwarded a report by the Physician to the Legation which said—“ The Russian Government have sent Doctors to the followin°' places : Julfa, Tehran, Meshed, Kerman, Bushire and Bunder Abbas.' In October 1897, our Embassy at Constantinople sent to our Resident at Baghdad, for Secret E , January 1898, Nos. 144-149. report, a confidential communication from Jeru- r, i ™ i- salem &gt; whicl1 stated M. Krouglow, a Rus sian Consular Officer proceeding to Baghdad, had been “instructed to report, on his arrival at Baghdad, on the much-desired scheme of securmg for Russia a coaling station in the Persian Gulf though I have not been able to ascertain whether any particular place, outside the Persian territory, has been fixed upon' Colonel Loch passed copies of the papers to Colonel Meade at Bushire, and the latter wrote demi-officially m January 1898, referring to the movements of three Russians two of whom were doctors who came to Bushire in and after February 1897. Colonel Meade said— These Russians told Lumsden' (the Residency Surgeon) “ that they had been deputed bv thar owa Government to enquire into and study the plague’ Lumsden poTuted outT fhem that there was not any plague in the Persian Gulf, and there can, I fancy, be little doubt that they were also employed in enquiring into political matters in the Persian Gulf and that there is some intention on the part of Russia to get a coaling station here.'

The telegram had reference to the question of the value to India of the Kerman Consulate but that is part and parcel of the general question. I do not know what steps if any,, the Finance Department have been taking to examine the commercial aspects of the case • but it is perhaps doubtful whether, under present conditions, they can add much to their notes at pages 5-8 above. Sir Mortimer Durand has noticed, since he went to Tehran, the difficulty of obtaining from traders themselves any comprehensive proposals for the general good of British commerce. We are not likely to get any fresh statistics from the Persian Gulf for some months yet. The Trade Report for 1896-97 was not received till late in October last, and Colonel Talbot, who had local knowledge, noted in 1896 that the figures of trade were generally not available before May or June. In noting on the Khorassan Trade Report for 1896-97 (which is the Report re ferred to in the Revenue despatch* from the Secretary of State, No. 209, dated the 2nd December 1897) Mr. O’Conor said—“ It would be an advantage if we could have a complete report on the trade of Persia as a whole each year. At present we have only fragmentary reports like this one on the trade of Meshed, another on the trade of Shiraz, and one or two others. But we have no general connected review of the trade of the whole country. The commercial intercourse between Persia and India is close and (considering the material condition of that country) not unextensive, and there would be a distinct advantage in the possession of a general report on the trade of the country, such as we have of the trade of China and of Java. It would be of importance to English as well as to Indian merchants having in view the methods by which Russia seeks to thrust out both British and British Indian goods from the Persian as as well as from the Turkistan markets. I would venture to suggest that this report could be compiled at Tehran under the orders of Her Maiesty’s Minister as in European countries, and that the reports of the Consuls might either be printed as appendices to the report or continue to be published separately. It would not be out of place for the Government of India to make this suggestion to Her Majesty s Government, for Indian revenues contribute to the payment of the Diplomatic and Consular establishment in Persia.” . . , , , , . , Sir James Westland agreed that ‘it is a pity we don't get a critical review, but doubted “ if we ought to interfere in the matter of our own motion.

He thought that, if Russian railway communication was extended south of the existing Trans-Caspian line, it might be necessary for us to follow her lead and that “ we ought to be able to keep pace with her.” The Merv-Kushk extension is being pushed on and may be finished shortly right down to the Afghan frontier at Tauurah (Sheikh Junaid), which is more than 150 miles south of the nearest point reached by the Trans-Caspian Railway system in 1891, and only about 70 miles from Herat. As far as I am aware, we have made no substantial progress in the matter of acquiring information of practical value as to routes along which it may be held desirable, now or in the not far distant future, to construct railways towards or into Persia. On the other hand we have just ( 2 nd May) received through the India Office a report from our Military Attache at St. Petersburgh that “ material required to equip a line of rail, of the normal Russian guage, from the terminus of the present Merv-Kushk extension to Herat ” is to be stored at Kushk. Such a measure was perhaps to be expected—as I see the “ Pioneer” has suggested—; but the India Office regard the information as “ undoubtedly important” , and their letter to the Foreign Office says— “ For the first time since the demarcation of the border line between Russian and Afghan territories, the Russian authorities appear to be making preparations that afford some ground for doubting their intention to abide by the Boundary Convention, and for supposing that they are contemplating the eventuality of a military movement from their side into the territory of the Amir of Kabul.” Sir Nicholas CP Conor has been instructed to report any further information he may be able to obtain on the subject, and-if the report has been or is received by him “ m any shape that can be officially quoted to take a favourable opportunity of mentioning the matter to the Russian Government and of enquiring as to its meaning.” 15 In the linked file (which may perhaps beheld in await until some general decision has been arrived at on the present case) are papers relating to « the e V stl “S »f mbs jan 0 local headmen for the protection of our telegraph hues; n) the position ^ e of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in the matter of political duties, (in) as to the political charge of the Persian-Makran Coast. m a despatch No. 6 .

Please move Persian Govern- ment'to turn him out ” Captain Sykes has drawn attention to the importance of Bampur, and the place is one which should, apparently, be borne in mind, if any general scheme of new consular appointments in Southern Persia is to be considered. 16. I suppose we may set aside the scheme of 1887 for reviving the military organisation of the Persian Telegraph Department. Apparently the only military officer now employed in the Persian Gulf and Persian Sections of the India List for January 1897, page 31. Indo-European .Telegraph Department is Lieu tenant-Colonel Wells, R.E., the Director of the Persian Section. I believe that, since 1887, a great deal of information has been collected in respect to the military resources of Persia. (The Intelligence Branch could, of course, speak about this.) The employment of military men on political or consular duties in Persia is, perhaps, therefore not so important a consider ation as it was ten years ago. What we do seem to need in political and commercial interests is a more extended consular system. The details of any reorganisation and expansion of the existing staff would, of course, be primarily a matter for the Tehran Legation; but, as far as I am able to judge from the papers I have examined, we ought to have a British officer perma nently at Kerman, and, if the position is to be made really satisfactory, at least three others, in addition to the existingf scale, who might f Given at the end of paragraph 10 above. perhaps be posted at Birjand, Nasirabad and Bampur. If these officers were all of the rank of Vice-Consul, the additional expenditure (including Kerman) could apparently not be less than £1,960 a year, taking the charges for each Vice- Consul at pay £350 and office allowance £140. On many grounds, however, it might be best to fill such appointments with selected officers of the Staff Corps. They could hardly be given less than £500 a year on appointment, rising to £600, and with office allowances and incidental expenses, the total cost might be set down at about £3,000 a year. On the other hand it seems possible that savings might be secured by reducing the status of some of the existing Consular appointments. With a re-arrangement such as above suggested, one or two Native Consular Agents for Bunder Abbas and similar points would probably be desirable, at any rate as a temporary measure, in order to secure necessary information as to trade : while the Political Agent at Maskat might, as suggested by Colonel Meade, have general charge of the Persian Makran coast. Supposing that the whole scheme cost even as much as £5,000 a year, it seems to me that it would be well worth trying, at any rate as an experiment for, say, five years. Her Majesty's Government would presumably bear some share, if not half. There is, however, the further consideration that in the south, at any rate, it might be vexy desirable, if not essential, to give the Consular officers reliable escorts. Assuming, as I suppose we may safely do, that escorts of Indian troops could not or would not be given the scheme sketched by Sir Mortimer Durand (paragraph 11 above) to provide escorts, locally raised at Persian expense but under British officers, seems a very attractive one. It ought not to cost the British Government much. As far as I am aware, Persia at present has no troops who could be described as “thoroughly trustworthy.' It has to be remembered that Sir Mortimer was writing at a time when the position in and recent occurrences in the Shuster neio-hbourhood would have justified “resolute pressure' being brought to bear on the Persian Government. Whether such pressure could now be brought is, perhaps, an open question; but the disorder in Persian Baluchistan and the riots at Bushire give us just ground for complaint. 17. I have noted the opinions recorded in regard to railway extension. The considera- J See paragraph 7(i) above. tions involved are so largely military that I hesi- T 10 0 « • i . , tate to venture any opinion. The despatcht of the 24th June 1887 said, m regard to the Ahwaz-Tehran railway, “ we observe that Her Majesty s Government are already committed to a decided line of policy It appears that if capital were to be raised by public subscription for the construction of the proiected railway and for the navigation of the Karun, a guarantee of not less than 3 per cent given bv the Imperial Government, or given by the Government of India and endorsed by the Imperial Government, would be indispensable.' J F 18 I have placed in the file External B., October 1897, Nos. 93-98, which contains demi-official correspondence regarding a suggestion to dispense with the coast line of teleo-raph from Karachi to Jask, and to replace it by an inland line from Kalat to Kashan by PanVur Bampur, Kerman and Yezd.

Indeed it is not clear that there is any real necessity for a loan.

The Nasr-ul-Mulk, whom Mr. Hardinge describes as “ the only man in Persia having the requisite education and ability ^ to reform the finances ”, was appointed Finance Minister in February last.

The Sadr Azam gave way however, and agreed that “ the receivers of the bank should encash all the duties and have also the right to see that they are duly leived.” We may hear shortly what precisely has been arranged. The revenue of Persia may, I understand, be set down at nearly £1,500,000, though fre quently not much more than £1,000,000 has been actually collected. Of recent years there have been recurring deficits of about £50,000 a year; but, on the other hand, the public debt is apparently small. 20. To sum up, the observations which should perhaps be made might, I think, be somewhat on the following lines :— (i) Adhere generally to previous views regarding the importance of extending our influence in Southern Persia; of developing Persian resources; and encouraging British and British Indian trade. (ii) Insist on the necessity of avoiding any entanglement which might drain our own military strength. (iii) Indicate, within limits, the extent to which expenditure might, as an experimental measure, be undertaken from Indian revenues upon extending our influence and protecting and encouraging our trade. Enquire to what extent Her Majesty's Government would share in such expenditure. Offer remarks here as to the points at which, subject to the opinion of the Tehran Legation, it might be well to place Consular Agents. Mention that better rule on the Perso-Bahich border should _ re-act beneficially on our side of the frontier and assist the Government of India in adhering to the policy of not pushing out posts into Makran. (iv) Notice the possible necessity, in some places at any rate, of givino- any newly appointed Consular Officers reliable escorts. Advert to Sir Mortimer Durand ; s scheme, but endorse his apprehensions of the risk of countermoves by Russia Notice, on the other hand, that serious disorder in Persia might afford Russia legitimate or plausible ground for interference.

A collection of recent Foreign Office Prints, &amp;c., about the loan (paragraph 19 of my note) is tied up separately at the bottom of this nle. I have not discussed the point that the death of the late Shah did not—as some had expected—lead to serious convulsions in Persia. The Shah's assassination appears to have taken every one by surprise and no safe deductions can, I think, be based on the (practically) peaceful accession of the Yali Ahd. 11th May 1898. H. Daly. His Excellency. I do not wish to add to Captain Daly's full and thoughtful note. The question put by the Secretary of State refers to the policy to be considered or followed if matters in Persian Baluchistan' come to a crisis. It does not seem as if the disturbances there were now going to end (without extraneous help) in Persian Baluchistan breaking away from Persian control. If, however, that should take place, it would be necessary to keep out Russian control; and the two ways of doing that, which are indicated, are the development of the natural resources and capabilities of the country so as to strengthen Persia, or the increase of British influence in order that British and not Russian control may step into the place of Persian authority. Neither can be put off until the crisis has arisen. A tolerably long step appears to have been taken in placing the control of Bushire customs under receivers of the Imperial Bank of Persia. The confidence which that should give to trade would be increased by stationing British Consular officers at selected inland points^ The development of trade, increase of British influence and improvement in the position of 1 ersian authority would march together. . . , It is perhaps hardly practical to give attention now to railway communication towards Seistan but it does seem clear that the forward movement on the part of Russia, which our activity in the direction of Seistan would, it was feared, stir up, has already taken place ; and it doesYt seem wild to imagine that a move on the communication wSonM be S to £ lecXy of State may be on the lines indicated in Captain Daly's 20th paragraph. ^ W.

CUNINGUAM.I quite agree as to the value of Captain Dal/s note, and I think it states the case very fairly I cannot help feeling, however, that we might with advantage abstain from such an exhaustive despatch as is foreshadowed by his proposals m paragraph 20 What we have to answer is a single sentence at the end of the telegram of December 27th, and the enquiry there made had reference to what our action should be, supposing a crisis occurred m Persian Baluchistan. We have already replied that military intervention is impossible, so tar as we are concerned, and I cannot imagine that there will be any difference of opinion on that point. But if we take up that position I see no advantage in discussing possible dangers, such, e.y., as the acquisition of a coaling port by Russia, which must be just as obvious to Her Majesty s Government as to us. If we lay stress upon these things, depend upon it we sha 1 be called upon to contribute at any rate a share of the cost; and we simply have neither the men nor the money. 2. The despatch of June 24th,* 1887, paragraph 4, says all that can now be said, and we . have nothing to do but to adhere to that de- * Secret E., August 1887, Nos. 277-408 (No. 408). gcr iption of the general position. 3. So far as commercial interests are concerned, I understand the Finance Department to hold that there is no case for our embarking in the expense of Agents, and certainly the figures supplied do not show a large trade. I think that the hopes entertained by some as to the future of the new route to Seistan may some day be realised, but that nothing is so likely to prevent or postpone this as premature activity. I take it for certain that, as General _ Brackenbury pointed out in the papers to be f Secret E., June 189 , os. - . found in the discussion of 1891,t any step we take will stir up Russia to take another. On the other hand, the Tea interest in the Kangra Valley pressed upon me the other day the desirability of Consular Agents in Seistan, and reports I have just seen from Lieutenant Webb-Ware indicate that the route is being used. „ .„ T ^ n . I do not think we are vet in a position to go J Secret E., August 1887, Nos. 277-408 (No. 408). £urther than the 18871 despatch went On this side of the question, and I entirely concur with the majority of the then Council in their views on the railway extension, but I should not wish to say finally that we would not contribute to the establishment of Consular Agents, if and when Her Majesty’s Government thought it could be safely attempted and were prepared to share the expense. In the event of a sudden crisis all that it seems to me that we can do is to call upon Her Majesty's Government to see that Indian interests—and especially our right of access to the Persian markets—are not prejudiced. Two Powers, I imagine, alone can be concerned—Persia itself and Russia—and with both it is for Her Majesty’s Government to deal diplomatically. 4. As regards telegraphs. So long as the line is a coast one, I presume it will fall rather to the navy to protect the stations, though we might have to furnish detachments as we have done recently. Our interest in the line is large enough to warrant our doing this, so long as we confine ourselves to the defence of the few stations on the coast. I heard from Mr. Ffinch in Calcutta of the idea of an inland line, but as it is postponed sine die, I do not think we need refer to it. It might alter the whole conditions materially. 5. Politically our chief interest consists in the effect of disturbance on our own people. I think I should mention that the Government of India in 1894 laid it down that we were not to keep troops in Makran or undertake any responsibilities there, and say that we adhere to that policy, but that recent events show that we may be called upon to interfere, and that disorder on the border will of course increase the chances. 6.

It is noteworthy that Colonel Picot's summary for the 28th March to the 28th Apn 1898 contains the following :—‘ Rumours are heard of the intention of the Russian Government to despatch a scientific party to Baluchistan.

I should ima o 'ine it is only the outcome of the normal policy of Russia that has caused ind is causing her^action. Possibly also the necessity of securing the food-supplies of Rhorassan for her army°has induced her to force her influence on that province. It has been an accepted theory for many years that a desire for an outlet on the Persian Gulf is the chief spur to her movements, but I should suppose that her recent successful tactics in the far EasTmay possibly modify her wish for a port in the Gulf.

The statistics of the direct trade with Persia by sea are given at page 20 of the notes. In the year 1897-98 there was only a slight recovery from the contraction of the previous year, the increase in the exports being about Rs. 6,80,000. There was a great decline in the tea trade, the reduction being 1,127,4481b for Foreign and 529,4291b for Indian tea. This is evidently due to the plague in Bombay, but as yet we have only the totals of the trade, the detailed statistics and reports from the Customs Collectors having yet to come in. The destination of the trade by land is not precisely known, but in 1897-98 the tea exported from Sind and British Baluchistan amounted to 3,808lb Indian and 34,3841b Foreign. 28th July 1898. J. A.

Perhaps it would meet the views of the former if the passage at A in paragraph 3 were changed to— “ Russian activity in the direction of Seistan is not likely to be counteracted by anything that it is in our power to do there. Activity on our part would tend rather to excite it. 33 The Hon'ble Finance Member’s alterations will be accepted. 5th August 1898. W. J. Cuningham. It is, I admit, difficult to prove cause and effect in such cases, but I think more has been read into the passage on which His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief and the Hon’ble Military Member comment than was intended. Personally I did not understand it to refer to the ambition of Russia to get a port on the Persian Gulf, or to an extension of Russian railways (on the latter I agree pretty much with Sir E. Collen). What I had in my mind was something much smaller, but still what we considered of sufficient importance to report to „ the Secretary of State in 1894. I think that we were all agreed then that Colonel Yate s proceedings were calculated to excite Russian activity—indeed he admits as much himself (see C rviw™ tvjv, marked passage on page 5 of the notes enclosed Same Collection, No. 4. in his letter of March 11th, 1894). See also notes, especially that of Sir H. Brackenbury, dated June 30th, 1894. I believe that Colonel Yate’s activity was premature, that it gave rise to Russian activity at the time, and made it difficult, if not impossible, to interfere with the institution of a cordon of Russian posts in Persian territory last year on the excuse of plague. I do not, however, think it necessary to ask for the inclusion of my theories in this despatch, and I think that the easiest way to meet my Hon’ble Colleagues is to make the passage at A simply historical. I propose that it should run as follows :— “ Lord Bufferings Government entertained apprehensions that activity in the direction of Seistan might lead to a forward move on the part of Russia, and we drew attention to the same subject in our despatch of July 24th, 1S94.” I take it this will remove any difficulty my Hon’ble Colleagues feel, and that they will concur in the issue of the despatch as so amended. 6th August 1898.

I do not think, after this expedition, and the punishment which will fall on the murder- m-s or failino&gt; them on the tribe generally, that any one will care to murder an Englishman again ; but, as a precautionary measure, it will be better to give Campbell a small guard when he inspects the line, A few men should also be kept at Jask and Charbar, and, if possible they should he mounted so as to be able to hurry out whenever any trouble occurs The murder of Mr. Graves was an isolated piece of ruffianism, and had, I feel sure, no political meaning It was committed for loot, and was a stupid crime as they could have taken all meaning . the . old maUf rhat they did go to such lengths shews they wanted without g P f u t ibly low an d 5 if it had not been promplty clearly, however, that cm, ‘ “ en y , ^ Ag i( . is&gt; j hope taken up, ““^cYffooting that the lives and property of our people we may be able to put things . „ ? i jf One point is, I consider, essential will be as safe on the Makran Coast as m ^ b, a P Politick Officer.

These men, who are the clerks in charge at Jask and Charbar, are, of course, in difficult positions, and, being afraid, they treat the Baluchis as if they were addressing superiors. The Baluchis have in consequence become arrogant, and think they can bully our people with impunity. The Persian suzerainty is the great stumbling block. If we took over the protectorate, there would be no difficulty in dealing with these people, who could easily be taught that they must behave themselves, but the Persians have little or no authority, and yet insist on taking every penny they can out of the unfortunate people. Our position at present is an anomalous one. We acknowledge the suzerainty of Persia, and yet have relations with these Chiefs and pay them subsidies or stop paying them without any reference to the Persian Government. This little expedition has shewn me how difficult it is for the Persians to put even 100 men at any point on this coast, or to move them a mile inland when they have got there. To undertake any general scheme for really subduing these Baluchis or to keep them in order afterwards would he quite beyond their power. I believe the Persian Government is on the verge of dissolution, and will not ere long be in the position to assert, much less enforce, any authority over the more distant portions of the empire. When that time comes, we will have to consider if we can afford to allow certain places to fall into the hands of any other Power. The present oppor tunity seems to me a good one to occupy Jask and Charbar, as the ally of Persia, with her consent, and solely in defence of our own people, as Persia has shewn herself powerless to protect them. Once we are there, no one else can come. For these reasons, I think a small party should be sent from India, and I hope to hear soon that it can be done.

Of course, we are assured that the expedition is j* f purely scientific character, and its only object the investigation of the districts abutting on the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. But as two out “Li!.! ®, ve e ^P erts who are to compose the party are to be Russian staff omceis, Englishmen may be pardoned for looking a trifle more closely into the matter.. The term u purely scientific ” is construed very widely by the Muscovites, and covers a good deal more, as a rule, than appears on the sur face. The first expedition that entered Manchuria, a decade ago, was stated to be of ^ a “ purely scientific ” character, but this did not preclude the party frorn taking a couple of field guns with them, and, of course, the artillerymen required to work them. It was explained at the time that the guns were for the purpose of experiments on the velocity of sound at high altitudes. The explanation wap accepted, and now we see the result. As a matter of fact, the British Indian authorities have been, and are still, pushing an exhaustive survey of the whole of Baluchistan and the south-east of Persia as rapidly as circumstances will permit, and there is no more reason for a Itussian Ex pedition for this purpose than for a British survey of Eastern Siberia. There are probably two distinct motives operating with the St. Petersburgh authori ties in sanctioning the expedition to which we refer. In the first place, they have been a good deal nettled at the construction of new trade route through Baluchistan by the British. This road has tapped the commerce between India and Turkistan, and sent it round by way of our neighbour State, and the Muscovites would now like to ascertain if it be possible to divert it again. In the second place, there are a great number of Russian statesmen and public ists who believe that they ought to secure an outlet somewhere on the Persian Gulf or its vicinity, and that it is well to begin to look about them in time. But whatever the motives, or combination of motives may be, the expedition to Baluchistan is one that will require watching. The Banish Lieutenant Olafsen’s second expedition to the Pamirs deserves all the more attention, writes the Standard's T&amp;zxYm correspondent^ as the comprehensive preparations clearly show that like all the Itussian “ scientific ’ expeditions to distant and unknown regions it will be of very great political importance. The Czar himself is most keenly interested m it, and has ordered the official authorities to do all they can to help it. The journey will last about two years. The expedition will go from St. Petersburgh by land through Caucasia, Trans-Caucasia and Turkistan to the vil age o£ Osh on the Chinese frontier, Lnd then to Lake Yashikul which lies twelve thousand feet above the level of the sea in the Alichur Pamir, the fauna and flora of which are to be studied It will then go to the Khanate of Wakhan to s udy and survey the studied, it w g ter m Bokharaj and establish a numerous ™ins there.

I shall be obliged if Your Excellency’s Government will give your careful consideration to the matter, having regard not only to the arguments contained in the Eoreign Office letter, but also to the importance in the interest of India of securing the means of observing political and commercial movements in this part of Persia, and on the hues of transit to Afghanistan. 4. It further appears to me that the maintenance of a Consular Agent in Kerman may be useful in counteracting any adverse influences which may be brought to bear against the development of British and British Indian trade in this region. ■ ENCLOSURES. £ No. 1.

The Government of India at the time reserved their opinion in regard to the Consular appointment in question (see their Secret despatch of 1st November 1893), and it is understood that, when again approached in June 1894, they stated that they were not prepared to make any provision for the payment of a salary to Lieutenant Sykes who had applied for the post. Under these circumstances, an application was made to the Trea s ury, who finally agreed to grant a small allowance of two hundred and fifty pounds a year to an officer who would be willing to undertake the duties of a Consular officer at Kerman without further remuneration. This arrangement was originally sanctioned for two years as a provisional measure. On being requested to authorize the continuance of the allowance of two hundred and fifty pounds a year, the Treasury have stated that, as the post was admittedly required for the convenience and assistance of British Indian subjects, part at least of the cost ought in‘equity to be borne by Indian revenues. In the meantime, a report has been received from Sir M. Durand Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, on the Consular establishment in Persia in which he recommends the maintenance of a permanent post at Kerman. 5 He suggests that, if an officer of the rank of Vice-Consul were appointed, the outlay tor salary and office allowance might be put at five hundred pounds a It does not appear probable that any officer could be found willing to succeed Lieutenant Sykes in the discharge of Consular duties at Kerman in return tor the small allowance of two hundred and fifty pounds. Lord Salisbury feels, however, precluded from making any further application to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in this connection, unless the Govern ment ot India are prepared to contribute half the cost of the Kerman establish- menu Under these circumstances, I am to inquire whether Lord George Hamilton will again refer the matter to the Government of India with a view to the re-consideration of their decision. &amp; (Extract.)

I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to state that a telegram has been received from Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, reporting that Captain Sykes is now available for duty at his post, and that he has instructed him to proceed to Kerman, to watch the proceedings of the Governor, who is advancing with a large force to subdue the revolt in Baluchistan and to punish the murderers of the late Mr. Graves. The presence of a British Consular Officer in the Kerman district seems specially required in the present condition of affairs, and Lord Salisbury proposes to approve the instructions given by Mr. Hardinge to Captain Sykes. I am, however, to remind you that no decision has been arrived at with regard to the permanent establishment of a Consulate at Kerman, and to state that His Lordship would be glad to learn Lord George Hamilton’s opinion on the arrangement suggested in the letter from this office of the 12th of October last, which depended on the Government of India being prepared to contribute half the cost of the proposed establishment.

HAMILTON, Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 10th August 1898. My Lord, In a telegram, dated the 27 th Decemher 1897, Your Lordship enquired whether we had any observations to make on the policy which, having regard to British Indian interests, commercial, telegraph and political, it is desirable that Her Majesty’s Government should consider or follow if matters in Persian Baluchistan come to a crisis. Your telegram had reference to the suggested despatch to Charbar and Jask of detachments of native infantry for the protection of the telegraph staff and stations. The Viceroy’s telegram of the 4th January informed Your Lordship that we were prepared to send such detachments; but could not reply, without further consideration, regarding the extent of British interests in Persian Baluchistan, though effective military intervention or occupation could not be attempted with the forces at our disposal. In answer to another telegram, dated the 18th Eebruary 1898, Your Lordship was informed that we were not then prepared to give a final opinion as to the value, in Indian interests, of a Consulate at Kerman; but were willing, in view of the existing situation in Persian Baluchistan, to meet m 1898-99 half the expense of sending Captain Sykes hack to Kerman, provided such moiety did not exceed Rs. 6,000.

We desire to adhere to the policy of avoiding as far as possible, any extension of our responsibilities m that direction; but recent events have shown that we may be called upon to intervene m Makran, and disorder across the border would undoubtedly prove a serious factor in the Question. The history of the late disturbances in Makran, with our views as to the situation there, will shortly be placed before Xour Lordship in a separate despatch. 3 As regards our commercial interests in Persia we are under a dis advantage in respect that we receive from the Diplomatic and Consular Officers no general report on the trade of the country, such as we have of the tiade ol China, Java, &amp;c. The information we possess does not indicate a very exten sive trade. We incline to the opinion that the hopes entertained of the future success of the new route from Quetta to Seistan may. in course of time be realised; hut we consider that premature activity is likely to prevent or post pone that result. Lord Dufferin’s Government entertained apprehensions that activity in the direction of Seistan might lead to a forward move on the part of E/ussia, and we drew attention to the same subject in our despatch of the 24th July 1894; we entirely concur in the opinion held by the majority of the Governor-General’s Council in 1887 on the subject of railway extension ; and the information supplied to Your Lordship since the issue of your Eevenue Despatch No. 209, dated the 2nd December 1897, will probably enable you to agree that the appointment of Consular Agents in Seistan is not rendered urgently advisable by considerations connected with possible trade in arms and ammunition between the Persian Gulf and Baluchistan. The desirability of arranging for such Agents has, however, been recently pressed on the attention of the° Viceroy by representatives of the tea interest in the Kangra Valley. Our returns of trade show that in 1887-88 the Indian tea exported to Persia was i Ann lbs., or little more than one-fifth of the amount of foreign tea imported into Persia. The figures for the last five years are quoted in the margin. The unfortunate check to the trade in Indian tea in 1896-97 is to be ascribed to conditions prevailing in India, and, in particular, to the dislocation of trade caused by the plague. The total trade by the Quetta-Seistan route did not reach 1| lakhs of rupees in the year 1896 ; in 1897 it exceeded 5 lakhs, and in the first four months of 1898 it was Es. 3,11,000.

Various matters connected with our trading interests in Persia were discussed in Sir Mortimer Durand’s Confidential despatch to the Poreign Office No. 51, dated the 14th August 1896. We could not provide escorts of Indian troops for Consular Officers in Persia, and we share Sir Mortimer’s apprehensions that action on our part might lead to countermoves by Eussia. On the other hand, serious disorder in Persia might afford Eussia a legitimate or plausible ground for interference, while better rule on the Perso-Baluch border—which might perhaps be facilitated by the appointment of a British Consular Officer at some such point as Bampur—should re-act beneficially on our side of the frontier and assist us in confining to the narrowest possible limits our responsi bilities in Baluch-Makran. The recent arrangem'ent whereby receivers of the Imperial Bank of Persia were to encash all customs duties at Bushire and Kerman shah and to have also the right to see that the duties are duly levied appears likely, if established, to prove an important step towards developing the natural resources of Persia and increasing British influence. We have also noticed with satisfaction the completion of the formalities in respect to the agreement between the Bakhtiari Chiefs and Messrs. Lynch for the construc tion of a road from Ahwaz to Ispahan.[ 3 ] question ofthe appointment^ of^ritish^Consukr^A of ,°P inio11 that tl10 in Southern Persia is one that rpm-nV™ p , T nsil ^ ai -^gents at important points eminent of that Goy- towards the cost of such a measure if nrirf ^v , 6 38 rf ex J! cr . lment &gt; to contribute think it could be safely attemuted’ w Her Majesty’s Government s^|,£^: l E 0 ?“i*ss ££“:3 system of customs should give to traders would doubtless he increased if British ofSchhfinc^^TTv^-l , 80160 *' 11 P? ints inlaild - Thetvelo“ wwff th t m l \ British influence and the consolidation of Persian authority should then advance together. In the event, however, of any sudden ° riS l’ ^ .Government of India could, in our opinion, do no more than rely on Her Majesty s Government to see that Indian interests—and especially our right oi access to the Persian markets—were not prejudiced. As regards telegraphs, so long as the line follows the coast, Indian interests are sufficiently involved to justify us in furnishing protective detachments as we are now doing at Jask and Charhar; hut we could not do more than provide in this manner for the defence of the few telegraph stations on the coast. We have recently heard of the resignation of the Amin-ed-Dowleh, on whom the title of Sadr Azam was conferred so lately as last December, and from whom and from his colleagues so much was apparently hoped for in the direction of reforms.

T tf&gt; a 0 kn ?T, ledse *i' e recei P t of Tour Lordship’s despatches J une . an( i ^°- 8 (Consular) of the 29th of September 1898, eallmg for my opinion with regard to certain suggestions for the appointment of additional Consular officers in Persia. The matter has engaged my attention for several years, and I have more than once expressed my opinion upon it. In September 1895, I wrote a memorandum reviewing the state of affairs in Persia, and submitting proposals for the improvement of our position. An officer had shortly before been sent Paragraph is. ac ^ as Consul in Kerman, and I wrote with reference to this appointment—“ It will strengthen our influence materially if we have more men of this kind in other parts of Persia as occasion offers, and if our representatives in Bushire and Ispahan and Khorassan are encouraged to travel and make friends among the Chiefs and tribesmen. We need not excite the ready alarm of the Russians by too frequent journeys along their border, but I think we should spend some money in encouraging travel elsewhere, and in establishing agencies at important points. Por instance, I feel very doubtful whether the Government of India are right in deprecating the establishment of a British officer in Seistan; and, under certain conditions, we might find it very useful to have a man in Shuster to help in the opening of the roads in the Lur and Bakhtiari country.” I also advocated an improvement in the position of the Consul-General in Tabriz. In August 1896, I submitted a detailed proposal for the establishment of a Consulate at Shuster on the Karun, where our traders had been brutally ill-used ; and I suggested that, for their protection and the maintenance of order, we might raise a tribal levy under British officers. A year later, when in England, I followed up these, suggestions by advocating the retention of the Kerman appointment, and again asking for the establishment of a Consul on the Karun. The result was that the Kerman appointment was continued provisionally, and since that time the nomination by the Russians of a Consul for Seistan has led to our also appointing a Consul for that district, but I believe no further steps have been taken to carry out my suggestions. These suggestions formed part of a general scheme of policy based upon an examination of the state of affairs in Persia in 1895. The further suggestion whicH now desire to submit must, I think, in in e’en oral scheme of policy, based upon an examination of the state ot attair ^ Persia at the present time. The question of our Consular establishmen s not be considered apart from the larger question. Almost the whole of the memorandum of 1895 applies to the present despatch may be considered as a /'PP 1 . 6 ™ 6 ?’ h ” ve taken place since then confine “y sel | *° P°\f“ S g °p p iyi n g at the same time such further inform- of affairs. Paragraph 17.For convenience sake, though* I trust the whole memorandum will he , considered, I will here quote the penulti- Paragraph 2v. , i t • i A • mate paragraph, which sums up my views and proposals. It ran as follows :— “ Persia is misgoverned and her condition is not satisfactory. Her finances are in disorder, and her resources undeveloped, and she contains some elements of disturbance, while there is no armed force upon which the Government can depend for the maintenance of its authority. The influence of Russia, which is antagonistic to our own, predominates at Tehran, and it is believed to be exerted against the interests of the country. “ On the other hand, Persia has practically no debt, and her natural resources are great. Her internal condition is not hopeless, or such as to cause immediate alarm. And the influence of Russia, th ugh predominant, is not exclusive. Russia has still a strong position throughout the country, and Russia, recognising her own weakness in Asia, seems unlikely for the pie'sent to take any step in Persia which would seriously offend us. “ The general situation, therefore, might be worse, but; it is not one with which we can rest altogether satisfied. “ It is not probable that Russia will combine with England in reorganising the Persian administration and in developing her trade; and there is little help to be got in this direction from other EurojDean nations, none of whom carry any weight in Tehran. c{ England by herself, especially if thwarted by Russia, cannot hope to overcome the opposition of interested persons in high places, and to carry a scheme of reform which shall regenerate Persia. She can hardly hope, indeed, to carry any reform of radical importance, and must fall back upon her exist ing policy, contenting herself with maintaining the integrity of Persia; watch ing and checking Russian aggression; gaining the good-will, respect and confidence of the Persian Government and people; developing trade; and taking such opportunities as may occur of urging measures beneficial to the country. “ With a view to maintaining the integrity and independence of Persia, it is desirable to make timely arrangements for securing a quiet succession on the Shah’s death, and we should endeavour to strengthen our influence over the heir-apparent by keeping_ an English with him, by improving the position of our representative at Tabriz, and in other ways. TV e should let it be understood that aggressive action by Russia in the north of Persia will immediately result in decided action by us in the south. In order to strengthen the friendly feelings entertained towards us in many parts of the country, we should encourage picked officers to travel among the Chiefs and people, and we should, as occasion offers, establish fresh agencies at important points. We should try to obtain for the people such benefits as a good currency. “The Persian Government should be made to understand that they must not trifle with us in the future, as they have occasionally done in the past; but we should try to gain their good-will, and to help them in any way we can! Just now there is an opportunity of putting them under a great obligation by relieving them to some extent of the burden of the Regie Debt, which they find very harassing. The Shah has begged us earnestly to help him in this way, and has at the same time formally asked our advice as to the reforms which should be made in his administration. I think we should give this advice to the best of our power, and should clear off the Regie Debt by lending the Persian Government half a million at 3 or J per cent on approved security and on certain defined conditions. These conditions should include advantaoes to our trade, such as the opening of the Upper Karun, and also a satisfactory guarantee that the revenue and expenditure of tbe Persian Government shall for the future, be made to balance.

All real power is at present m the hands of the Shah’s irresponsible advisers, notably hk doctor the Hakim-ul- Mulk. There is practically no Government. Someffi the troops ve disbanded themselves and the rest are unpaid. The pay of the Civil establishments is also m serious arrears. The finances, which were in disorder m 1895, are m worse disorder now. The Sadr-i-Azam has borrowed three hundred thousand pounds (£300,000) from the Russian Bank in Tehran, hut all attempts at raising a substantial loan have broken down; the revenues, except from customs, are coming in very slowly; and at this moment the one hope of getting any considerable sum of money lies in the sale of the Provincial Governorships to the highest bidder. This destructive system, abolished by the new Shah when he came to the throne, has been revived by the Sadr-i-Azam. And it is said that this year’s auction is to be on a very large scale indeed. There is much murmuring throughout the country at the state of things in Tehran, and the discontent is increased by the high price of food, which has led here and there. to some serious rioting. Altogether the internal condition of Persia is very unsatisfactory. The Russians meanwhile have not been inactive. To the north a road from Enzeli to Tehran, which had but little progress before the visit of General Kuropatkin to Persia in 1895, has since then been vigorously pushed on, and it is now nearly ready for wheel traffic throughout its length. This is a most im portant advantage to Russia, both from a commercial and from a military point of view r . Even now two-thirds of the imported goods sold in Tehran arc Russian. In the north-west Russia has pushed forward her railway towards Kars, and has surveyed a line from Kars to the Tabriz frontier, while within Azerbaijan there has been a remarkable propaganda among the Nestorian Christians, some thousands of whom have been won over to the orthodox Church, thereby obtaining Russian protection, and opening the door to Russian interference. To the north-east the Russians have constructed a good cart- road from Asterabad to the IMeshed frontier, and by energetically encouraging their trade in Khorassan they have secured a commanding position in this valuable market. Thev have also made use of the outbreak of plague in India to push down “'Sanitary” posts along the Afghan border, in the direction of Seistan, where also they are trying to introduce their trade and where they are shortly to have a Consul. Even in the centre of Persia, as far- south as Ispahan, the Russians have shown fresh activity by establishing there a Consulate on a considerable scale of expenditure ^ and our Consul reports that the sale of Russian goods has already begun to increase. I will not go into i • t i a- nm’sistent rumours which reach me as to Russian tue sent; UA , ~ detail here, or enumerate the perastent rumours^ .^ from the facts j haXuentionedTha’t the Russians haVe been working consistently, and not without effect, to push their trade and to enhance their political influence in natural that their operations, and the unsatisfactory state of should have had a depressing effect upon British trade. internal affairs,TTe are being rapidly ousted from tbe Khorassan market. In Tehran itself our trade is undoubtedly suffering and will suffer more as the Hesht road is opened to traffic. In the north-west our Trehizond trade has fallen off to a serious extent. Even in the Gulf ports, where by the way there has been some attempt at Belgian and German competition, we are not doing as well as we might be. The shrinking of our Khorassan trade has told here, and the most recent returns cannot, I think, be regarded as satisfactory. On the other hand, it must not be supposed that recent changes in Persia have all been unfavourable to our interests. This is not the case. In one respect we have reason to be very well satisfied. Three years ago almost every man in the country, Persian or European, believed that the death of the Shah would be the signal for general disorder, and for some marked advance on the part of Russia, posssibly involving the break up of the country. I stated in my memorandum of 1895 my reasons for doubting the correctness of this view, but it was the prevalent view, and I asked Paragraphs 7 and 17 . ]y| a j es ^y» s Government to make timely preparations. This danger at least has been averted. When His Majesty was murdered, it was very doubtful whether there would not be an outbreak of the Tehran garrison, which would have been followed by serious trouble all over Persia, and the Russian troops were in fact held in readiness for an immediate advance; but thanks to English money the outbreak did not take place and the succession was peaceful. If the present Shah should die as suddenly as his father, we may reasonably hope that the succession will again pass over quietly. This is no doubt a negative gain, but from our point of view it is very import ant. The Shah too, though weak, is well meaning, and not I think at all inclined to submit to Russian dictation. He has retained his English doctor in spite of determined attacks on the part of the Russian and Erench Legations, wdio wanted to put in a Erenchman, and he has nominated as his heir*apparent, 0 v „ 1COK his eldest son, who was opposed by the See paragraph 17 of the memorandum or 1895. T v . i-i* -i* liussians; and his most influential adviser, the Hakim-ul-Mulk, is believed to be very friendly to us. To turn to other matters mentioned in my memorandum of 1895 and connected points, we have defined the long disputed boundary between Persia and Kalat, and have pushed forward from India along the trade route to Seistan, and have sent officers into Seistan itself, and have made arrangements for the improvement of the trade route from Ahwaz to Ispahan. We have severely punished a tribe on the Gulf coast, which was responsible for the murder of one of our telegraph officers, and we have sent a detachment of British Indian troops to protect the telegraph line for the future. This has had a good effect. Disturbances have occurred in Kalat territory, but they have not spread to Persian Baluchistan, and the ruler of this important pro vince has throughout behaved in the most friendly manner. On the Karan, at Shuster, our people have suffered seriously from the fanaticism of the town mob, which has been fostered, if not created, by the weakness of the Persian Government; but we are on good terms with the Arabs and Bakhtiaris who hold the neighbouring country, and a little decided action on the part of the Persian Government would soon set matters right in Shuster itself, where the people were at one time particularly friendly to us. In the south we have greatly strengthened our position by insisting upon, and obtaining, the removal°of an obnoxious Governor of Bushire. I dwelt in my memorandum of 1895 upon Paraaranh 25 tlle im P orta nce of the principle involved, g 1 and I would invite special attention to the point. The effect of the case has been most remarkable. Altoo-ether it is certain from the reports of officers, who have had recent opportunities of judging, that in the southern zone our reputation just now stands very hirii indeed. In Tehran itself we have had to deal, and still have-to deal, with some hostility or obstructiveness on the part of influential officials, but among them also our action in the south has had its effect, and recent events in the Soudan 41 . 2 . 3. 4. 5. atThe'capftal wl in theVme^f ^ P olitical influence contrary I think that at this moment U is stronger ^ Shah - 0n the prospect.

Prom the Turkish frontier near Khanikin, “ the Baghdad route.” By the Karun ports, Mohammerah and Ahwaz. By Bushire. By Lingah, Bunder Abbas and minor ports in the eastern parts of the Gulf. 6 . Prom *Kalat territory. 7. Prom Afghanistan. The last-named route has been practically closed for the time, partly by the exactions of the Amir, and partly by the Russian sanitary posts, which have stopped the passage of caravans between the Afghan border and South- Eastern Persia. Of the other routes that by Trebizond still brings in a considerable volume of British trade, but less than half it once brought in. The estimated yearly value of this trade is now about three hundred and two thousand pounds (£302,000). Curzon’s estimate for 1889 was about six hundred and ten thou sand (£610,000). It should be observed, however, that although the decrease is doubtless due in part to Russian competition, it is also due in part to the Armenian massacres and the troubled state of the country during the last few years. There was a dreadful massacre in Trebizond itself which shook the confidence of our traders. Trade checked in this way is likely to be diverted to other channels rather than lost, and I believe this is what has happened. Part of our Trebizond trade has now passed over to the more southerly routes, especially that by Baghdad. The trade by the Baghdad route has increased in importance, and seems likelv to increase still further, especially if the railway system spreads m Asia Minor and Turkish Arabia. In the absence of any English competition, the Germans have unfortunately obtained a concession for making the road from Tehran to Khanikin; and British trade in this quarter is threatened by the Russian road from Kesht to Kazvin, which, under the terms of the concession may he prolonged to Hamadan. Still at present the bulk of the goods imported hv this route are British, and we hold the Kermanshah and Hamadan markets to y the exclusion of al European competitors. From there we push forward a T I— s ^7, - .'fiz f S sjs s™ «*-have been exceptionally small this year because of a had opium crop. .Also the water in the Tigris was so low that transport was much impeded. Curzon’s estimate for 1889 was £ 327,796. The Karun route may some day be one of the most important of all. The existing value of our trade is small, and the last figures* show a decrease on those given by Curzon for 1890, the total being only £126,550 as against £180,680. But there is reason to hope that the state of things will not continue. We are now opening out the road from Ahwaz to Ispahan, and believe that we shall thereby effect a large saving of time and cost in comparison with the Bushire and Ispahan route, which is long and difficult. Also we are trying to open out roads northwards from the Karun to Sultanabad, the centre of °the carpet trade, and to Hamadan and the surrounding country. I attach much value to the Karun route, which from the nature of things is entirely in our hands, and protected from any serious competition. Some good judges believe it will before long be our main trade route. Its future, however, is by no means certain, and we must not feel too sanguine about it. _ The Bushire route is at present the most important of all, the volume of British trade for 1897 being estimated at £1,155,039. This route must always be important, and seems likely to do well even if the Karun route develops. At present it fills the country with British goods as far as Ispahan, where the Russian competition is small, and even supplies Tehran, eight hundred miles from the sea. The eastern ports have suffered from the shrinking of the Khorassan and Afghan markets, and can show no increase on the figures given for 1889. Still they supply a very large tract of country, and their trade should not suffer any further from Russian competition. They ought easily to hold their own in Yezd, Kerman and South-Eastern Persia genefally. The value of their trade to us is estimated at £1,026,990 a year. The trade by the Kalat route is as yet small, but promises well. If we can succeed in pushing our goods into Seistan from the south of Khorassan by a caravan road from Quetta, and especially if the Government of India should decide to construct a railway, there may be a real future for this route. The estimated value of the trade for 1898 is £39,329. Altogether, if one looks at the map of Persia, the position held by our trade is very remarkable. It is in full possession of the country up to and includino* a line drawn from Khanikin by Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd and Kerman to Seistan. Beyond that line it has begun to give ground both in the north-west and in Tehran and in Khorassan j but, in spite of the great geographi cal disadvantages, it has by no means been excluded. Its total value is estimated at three million four hundred and eighty-eight thousand pounds (£3,488,000) This is an increase of nearly half a million on the estimate given by Curzon for 1889, a rise of 16 per cent in nine years. This is not I think a dis couraging state of things, especially when it is considered that the last seven years have been for Persia a very unlucky period in various ways. Year after year great tracts of territory in Southern Persia have been devastated by locusts Then we have had troubles consequent on the Tobacco Regie, and a severe epidemic of cholera, and disorder following on the death of the Shah and a succession of bad crops causing a great rise in the prices of food. In ’shiraz there has been such scarcity that three years ago the Persian Government contemplated importing wheat from India. Export of wheat has been forbid den for some time; and naturally the purchasing power of the population has been comparatively low, which has told on imports. And I imagine the plague m India has had a depressing effect on the Bombay and Karachi trade A1 together, though we have suffered and must suffer from Russian competition m the north, our trade has on the whole increased, and with better seasons it gives fair promise of prosperity. It should be noted that the shrinking of the * For the Karun and Gulf ports I have failed to get any complete figures later than those for 1897 6Kliorassan trade is partly due to ttiA foru a Asia by Batoum and Baku and the Trans'Casnin g Tf ls , now rcael1 Central Vremya writes very mournfully about this P ailway ' The “ years^but ai befoTsuSng h tS up tith V a tf ^ ^ Persia of lat e state of affairs and submitting pronosals for ; a vlew . of ^amimug the present it may be desirable to state briX wha t f TO Pr ° Vmg t 0Ur P ositi ° D &gt; I think country, and what amount of money we sVend on^T® 13 * es T tablishmell ts in the map which will give some idea of the political geography. aPPeild &amp; Sketch The Diplomatic and Consular staff is as follows of the Legation 1S estimated at £16,610 a gear, ot stud, India Jays €7,wa Service* who tXals^ tT° officers o£ the InaiaQ Political service, wno a ^® also Consul-General and Vice-Consul, and a Surgeon The total cost of the Agency is estimated at £8,600 a year.

Midway between the two seas at Ispahan, we have a Consulate costing £750 a year. This is paid by Her Majesty’s Government. There is also a native Agent, who costs £24. Further south again at Shiraz, we have a native Agent, costing £160 a year. This is paid by India. To the east of Shiraz, half-way to the frontier of India, we have a Con sulate at Kerman, who costs £500 a year. This appointment is provisional. Half the cost is paid by India and half by Her Majesty’s Government. The Consul at Kerman is now in Seistan, where it is proposed to keep a Consul in future. Finally, along the coast of the Persian Gulf, we have— At Mohammerah a Vice-Consulate, which costs £490 a year. This is paid by Her Majesty’s Government. At Bushire a Besident, who is also Consul-General for Fars, with three Assistants, one of whom is Vice-Consul, and a Surgeon. _ The cost of the Kesidency is estimated at £7,700 a year. This is paid by India. The political work on the coast between Bushire and the Kalat frontier is in the hands of the Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs, who gets an allowance of £120 a year. This is paid by India. The Evident at Bushire has also under his orders native Agents at Bahrein, Shargah and Lingah, and they cost about £240 a year. This completes the statement of our diplomatic, political and Consular establishments m Persia and the Persian Gulf. It will be seen that we employ twenty one British officers, and that the total cost is about thirty-six thousand nTne huXd and seventy pounds (£ 36 , 970 )^ Of tins total ^ make out, Her Majesty’s Government pay £12,876 and the Government India £24,094.I should add that in the case of non-Indian Consulates, I have made nO allowance for travelling charges, as these are quite uncertain. We might perhaps add about £1,500 a year for this and other minor charges which I need not mention. Besides the Diplomatic and Consular establishments, it is to he observed that we maintain in Persia and the Persian Gulf a considerable Telegraph Department, with a numerous staff of English clerks. This Department has been, and to some extent still is, a valuable organisation for political and intelli gence purposes. The Telegraph clerks can supply much useful information at times, and in out-of-the-way places they are often called upon to act in some what responsible situations. The sketch map appended to this despatch shows the line of telegraph through -Persia and the Gulf, of these the lines extending from Tehran to Bushire and the line along the Gulf coasts to Eao, Jask, Charbar and the Kalat border are maintained by our telegraph staff, and are thoroughly efficient. The Persian line from Tehran to Meshed is inspected by our Telegraph staff, and the Government of India give a grant-in-aid of twenty thousand rupees a year towards the cost of maintenance. We have an English clerk at Meshed. This line works well. The line from Tehran to Julfa in the north-west is in the hands of the Indo-European Telegraph Company, which has its head-quarters in London, but it is of no great use to us for political purposes, as it is closely watched by the Russians. This line is efficient. The rest of the lines shown on the map are maintained and worked by the Persian Government and are very inefficient indeed. We can go on to review as a whole the state of affairs in Persia in 1899, and to consider what steps we can take to improve our position. The internal condition of the country, which was bad enough in 1895, is now in some respects decidedly worse. The Shah, though a more amiable man than his father, is weak and easily misled ; the Prime Minister has no power, and cannot control his colleagues or the provincial authorities; the finances are in complete disorder, and the revenues are coming in very slowly; the troops are unpaid, and inclined to be mutinous; food is dear all over the country; and the people are discontented. Meanwhile, the Russians have been actively pushing their trade and political influence in the north of Persia, and with some success. They have even succeeded in establishing posts along the Afghan border, and in making themselves felt in Seistan and Ispahan. On the other hand, it is as true now as it was in 1895 that the internal condition of Persia is not hopeless. She has practically no debt, and her resources are great. And though the influence of Russia is perhaps predominant in Tehran, yet England has still a strong position throughout the country. The quiet succession the Shah was regarded as being, and was in fact, a great success for us; and the Shah s nomination of his eldest son as heir-apparent, though the Russians were known to favour a younger son, also tended to increase our reputation. In various respects His Majesty has shown good-will towards us, and a decided disinclination to put himself under Russian control. In the south of Persia that is up to a line drawn from Khanikin on the Turkish frontier through Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd and Kerman to Seistan, our trade and our political influence are paramount, and indeed, so far as Russia is concerned, almost^ exclusive. Russia has only just begun to touch the fringe of the zone at Seistan and Ispahan. Neither her Consular establishments nor her trade extend beyond these points. In the north zone, on the other hand, although the local influence of the Russians is strong, we have our Consular establishments right up to the Russian border; and our trade, though it is suffering from Russian competition, is by no means beaten out of the field. The southern zone in fact, is very much more in our hands politically and commercially than the northern zone is in Russian hands. All over Persia a large part of the telegraph system is worked by us in one form or another and our bank has established itself in Tabriz and Resht and Meshed!Altogether, considering the advantages Russia has enjoyed, we have much reason to be surprised that our position should be so good as it is. Nevertheless though things might be much worse than they are, it cannot be denied that both from a political and a commercial point of view our position is bein» threatened. We_ have now to consider what are the steps which we should take to maintain and improve it. In discussing this point I shall proceed on the assumption that we cannot hope to come to terms with Russia, and persuade her to join us in a policy of Paragraph io. reform and development. I suggested in my memorandum of 1895 that such a proposal if made hy us might possibly he accepted hy Russia, especially if it formed part of a larger scheme for the general settlement of our relations in Asia, and I pointed out how advantageous such an arrangement would he for both countries. But I assumed that the scheme was impracticable, and that we must continue to work alone, with Russia watchful and more or less anta gonistic. Under these conditions the question is what we can do hy ourselves. In my memorandum of 1895, I answered that question in the following words:—“England by herself, especially aragrap i 2 . Russia, cannot hope to overcome the opposition of interested persons in high places, and to carry a scheme of reform which will regenerate Persia. She can hardly hope indeed to carry any reform of radical importance, and must fall hack upon her existing policy, contenting herself with maintaining the integrity and independence of Persia ; watching and checking Russian aggression; gaining the good-will, respect and confidence of the Persian Government and people; developing trade and taking such opportunities as may occur of urging measures beneficial to the country”. In the body of the memorandum, I explained at length the difficultes in the way of all attempts at reform, and I proposed certain definite steps which we should take in prosecution of the general policy stated above.. Substantially the answer now must, I think, be the same as it was in 1^95» for substantially the position is the same. But the changes which I have noted in the internal condition of the country, and the recent efforts of the Russian lr! the north and centre of Persia, seem to make it necessary that I should supplement the proposals I made three yearn ago, and should explain m somewhat greater detail the measures which I think desirable. The chief proposal which I have to make meets the question raised m Your inecnieip p It is that we should increase and render Lordship s despatch establishments in Persia.

(b) The Kerman Consulate should be made permanent, and perhaps a British Vice-Consul or native Agent should be sent to Bampur. (c) The Resident in Bushire should spend the summer in Shiraz, and any necessary expense for a house and other details should be incurred. (d) We should raise the pay of the Consul at Ispahan and improve his position. (e) We should appoint a Consul for the Karun and Arabistan, with head-quarters at Ahwaz, Shuster or Mohammerah. It may be necessary to put under him one or two native Agents. (/) We should replace the native Agent at Kermanshah by a British Vice-Consul. (g) If the Government of India agree, I am inclined to think that should have a Vice-Consul in Bunder Abbas, with charge of the trade throughout South-Eastern Persia. Also, if the Government of India wish it, there can be no objection on the part of this Legation to the appointment of a British officer to Bahrein. (h) Finally we should perhaps place a British Vice-Consul in Urumia or thereabouts, and we should improve the position of the Consul- General at Tabriz. The grounds for these recommendations are apparent from all I have written before. (a) With regard to the first recommendation, the importance of Seistan has long been recognised, and the recent reports of Messrs. Webb Ware and Brazier-Creagh seem to put the matter beyond a doubt. M e must keep Seistan in our zone. It is too valuable, and would be too dangerous in Russian hands, for us to let the Russians continue unchecked their efforts to close it to us and our trade. The necessity for having native Agents in neighbouring districts is not, I think, so. clear. I have no great belief in the agency or what Surgeon-Major Creagh calls “ crafty, diplomatic natives,’’ unless they are very closely supervised. They often do more harm than good. But CajDtain Sykes will be able to advise after spending some months in Seistan. (b) It seems to me beyond dispute that a Consulate in Kerman is becoming yearly more necessary. We must maintain a thorough hold on 1 ersian Baluchistan, in the interests of our adjoining protectorate and of our trade. Kerman is the capital of this jmge and important province, and the head-quarters of the Governor-General, and a trade centre of some consequence. I am inclined to think that, if we have a British officer in Kerman, we do not want another at Bampur. For the present at least I should, tiy to do without, although we might send a native Agent there if the Consul thinks we can get a man who will not stir up mischief among the border tribes. i (c) Shiraz is a place of great importance, both commercially and as the capital of Ears, and the residence of the Governor-General. Our Consul-General for Ears should know something of the province and its ruler, over whom he should endeavour to establish a personal influence. Our interests in Shiraz should not be left to the present native Agent, who, according to all the accounts I receive, does very little good and some harm. I feel some doubt whether Resident m Bushire, who has a great deal of work to do m the Eersian Gulf, is not over-weigh ted by the charge of Ears 1011 that charge hnt her ! a ? CT to a PP oint a s P“ial officer to Wetg^ted ° hePMeQtI W ° Uld try the “-Semeat I (d) It is I think, evidently wrong that at a place like Ispahan where om trace and our political influence have hitherto been’in full possession, the newly-appointed Russian Consul should be better equipped than our own. The former has £800 a year pay a Secretary, and a free house, with other privileges, including an escort of Cossacks. The latter has £600 a year pay, of which he lias to gi\e back £60 in house-rent and £150 office allowance. I would make him a Consul-General and raise his allowances to the level of the -Russian Consul’s. (&lt;?) A Consulate on the Karan is perhaps the most necessary of all the appointments I have suggested. Ahwaz may hereafter become a very important trade centre, and from there we should work upon the Arabs and Bakhtiaris and Lnrs, establishing our hold upon them, and opening up the routes through their country, and perhaps raising from among them an irregular levy. The Besident in Bushire would prefer for the present to keep our Consul at Mohammerah. I doubt the expediency of this, as he should get into touch with the Lurs and Bakhtiaris quite as much as with the Arabs of the Lower Karan. However this may he, the Consul will probably require a native Agent or two for commercial work. We should, I think, for the present at least, leave the Karun under the Consul-General for Bars. Our merchants would prefer his being in direct communication with Tehran, and Captain Sykes in his report on the Karan recommends this; hnt I do not think we should, until the necessity is very clearly proved, take away the district from the charge of the Consul-General. _ It is better that we should have the whole of the Gulf coast in one hand. ( f) A British Vice-Consulate at Kermanshah is, I think, very desirable. Our trade by the Baghdad route is increasing, and the route is a very important one in all respects. As I have shown, the British imports and exports by this route approach a million sterling. TVb must keep our hold on it if possible. Our native Agent, although a man of wealth and consequence, has from the time I have been in Persia done nothing for us, and has been a source of unending trouble and expense to the Legation owing to his quarrels with the Persians. It is the more important to keep our hold ori Kermanshah, because the Russians may at any time push on their ro a d from Kazvin to Hamadan.

But the north-western corner of Azerbaijan is of importance, both as the point where our Trebizoncl trade enters, and with regard to the Armenian question on the Turkish frontier, and as a post from which to keep a watch on Russian proceedings. On the whole, therefore, I should be disposed to send a man there, though he will probably be followed by a Russian. I have also recommended that we should improve the position of our Consul- General at Tabriz. The grounds for this are obvious. The British representative in this important place, the head-quarters of the heir-apparent and a great centre, gets £650 a year pay, and £270 office allowance. The Russian Consul- General gets £2,000 a year pay, and has a large staff of Secretaries and Munshis. The Turkish Consul-General has £1,020 pay and allowances, and is helped by a Vice-Consul and Attache. Even the Erench representative, who is not a Consul-General, and has very small interests to represent, gets £1,200 a year in pay and allowances, and has the aid of a Vice-Consul. All the foreign representatives have free houses. It may be argued that we ought not to attempt to rival the Russian Consul-General at this point. I think this is open to question, but in any case it seems to me unjust to our representative and unwise in our own interests, to place him in a position of such marked inferiority towards his colleagues. Mr. Wood urges that he should be allowed a personal assistant or confidential clerk. If the Vice-Consul is appointed in the first place to Tabriz, which will attract less attention, and spends a part of his time there, a confidential clerk will perhaps be unnecessary. But the danger is that he will spend too much of his time there. With regard to the limits of the new Consular districts, I cannot as yet give a precise answer in all cases. The limits of the Seistan Consulate, for example, must be fixed hereafter when experience has shown us the best line of division to the northward. The powers of the Kerman Consulate should extend to the territory ruled by the Persian Governor-General at Kerman. The limits of a Vice-Consulate at Bampur I cannot state .with accuracy. The Consul on the Karun should have charge of the country down to the sea, and westward to the Turkish frontier, and eastward to the eastern border of the Bakhtiaris, and northwards to the northern border of Luristan. The Vice-Consul at Kermanshah should have charge of the Kermanshah and Hamadan districts, and of the country northwards to the border of Azerbaijan. The Vice-Consul in TJrumia should perhaps be appointed simply Vice-Consul at Tabriz, whence he can be deputed to act under the Consul-General’s orders. The Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas should have charge of the Gulf ports east of Bushire, which form a Persian Governorship, and of Yezd and of Luristan. T will work out the precise limits of the several districts in communication with the officers on the spot. All or about all the Consulates in Persia should have a small guard of Indian troopers, say six men, as at Meshed. These should be picked men, if possible from Lancer regiments, and the non-commissioned officer should ’be a trained surveyor. .As to the cost of the additional appointments which I have proposed, I feel it extremely difficult to make a satisfactory estimate, because the English and Indian ways of looking at such charges are so essentially different. The posts under the Government of India are maintained on a considerable scale and cost a considerable sum of money. Those under the Eoreign Office are’ maintained on a very moderate footing, and cost comparatively little. Eor example, the Consulate-General at Tabriz costs altogether £920 a year while the Consulate-General at Meshed costs £8,600. I believe the sumptuary’alio w- * K ° TE - The American missionaries are greatly troubled by the Russian propaganda and ar e entirely with us.13 Mice of the Consul-General at Bushire is larger than the pay of the Consul. General at Tabriz As the work of the Consulates in Persia is not only Consu ar but. 1 olitical, and as a certain amount of show is very desirable in the East, I think the rates of pay and allowances given by Her Maiesty’s Gov ernment are much too low, and this view is evidently shared by the Eussians But I hesitate to propose appointments kept up on the Indian scale, because they would probably seem to Her Majesty’s Government out of all proportion to the importance of Persia. Another difficulty is that any new post main tained by the Government of India, for example, Seistan or Bahrein, would probably be brought on the list of the Indian Political Department, and the Government of India would have to fix the pay with reference to the interests of that department as a whole. How r ever, I would suggest as a basis of calculation that each Consul should have £600 a year pay, £150 office allow ance and £50 house-rent—total £800; and that each Vice-Consul should have £400 pay, £50 a year office allowance and £50 house-rent—total £500. I doubt whether this is enough, but anything less than this would certainly he too little. The Consuls-General at Tabriz and Ispahan should have at least £800 a year pay, £270 office allowance and a free house. The total expendi ture on all the appointments suggested would be five thousand and six hundred pounds (£5,600) as shown below:— £ * Seistan ••• ... ... 800 Kerman ... ... ... 800 Bampur ... ... 800 Bunder Abbas •. • •. • ... 500 Bahrein ... ... ... 500 Karnn oOO Kermanshah ... ••• ... 500 TJrumia ... •# * ... 500 Extra expenditure at Tabriz and Ispahan, say ... 700 Total ... 5,600 These proposals may be embarrassing from the point of view of the Poremn Office with reference to the rest of the Consular Service.

If the Resident at Bushire spends his summer in Shiraz, we can, I think, do away with the native Agent. This would save £ 160 a year. If we have a Consul at Ahwaz or Shuster, we can abolish the Vice-Consulate at Mohammerah. This would save £ 490, or a little less, as we may want to keep a Persian Agent there and possibly one at Dizful to do routine work. The native Agent at Kermanshah can be abolished, which would save £ 24 a year. Pinally, we can turn the Resht Consulate into a Vice-Consulate, thereby saving £ 300 a year. A Consul at Resht is not neces sary. He gets no information of Russian movements outside Persia, and he has no British trade to look after. A Vice-Consul could do all that is required. The money now spent at Kerman would be saved if a permanent Consulate were established there. I may perhaps be excused for suggesting that we might possibly employ to better advantage some of the money spent at Meshed. No doubt it is an important centre, politically and commercially, and the Government of India, who find the money, may not care to divert any portion of it to other posts in Persia. But after all a large portion of our trade in Persia is British Indian trade, and the maintenance of Persia as a political entity is largely, if not mainly, desirable on account of our Indian Empire. It certainly seems to me that some portion of the £8,600 spent at Meshed, and possibly some portion of the £7,700 spent at Bushire, might be better employed elsewhere. At all events something could be spared for Seistan. However, there is room for difference of opinion on this point, and I can only suggest a saving of £ 1,474 on Resht, Mohammerah, Kerman, Kermanshah and Shiraz. The saving at Shiraz could hardly take effect immediately, as we should have to give the Nawab some pension. We might, however, add to our savings the Karun subsidy of £2,000 a year. In all probability Messrs. Lynch would not receive this proposal with favour, but I do not think they would abandon the Karun, where they are now firmly established. Half of the sum would go to Her Majesty’s Government, and half to the Government of India. The prospective payments and savings of the two Governments might perhaps be arranged as follows :— Payments* England. £ India. £ Seistan... 800 Kerman 400 400 Bunder Abbas 500 Karun 400 400 Rermanshak 500 Urumia 500 Bam pur 500 Bahrein 500 Ispahan and Tabriz 700 Total ... 2,500 3,100 Savings.

The road through the Bakh tiari country from Ahwaz to Ispahan is now making progress. I hope to march over it a few weeks hence. After doing so I hope to return through the Lur country, and it possible to open the road from Dizful to the north. It is very desirable that our Karun trade should have an outlet northwards, and that the Sultanabad and Kurdistan carpets, and the Hamadan and Kermanshah exports should be able to get by the Karun. The carpets now go largely by Resht and Russia. In other directions we may be able to get roads made or improved as time goes on. The newly-appointed Governor of Shiraz, who seems very friendly, has promised me that he will do his utmost for the Shiraz-Bushire road, and he may possibly do something. An attempt is now being made to establish cart traffic between Sultanabad and Tehran, and the Imperial Bank of Persia have obtained the concession for a road from Kum to Ispahan. The advantage of this latter road to our trade is, however, doubtful. What we want above all is good roads from the point where our ships unload to the limits of our zone. This leads me to Since I have been m a point, which I think we should consider seriously. Persia I have tried to estimate the possibilities of a successful railway on various lines of country, but I have so far failed to discover a likely opening. It is conceivably possible, however, that careful examination by an expert might reveal a route which would prove a commer cial success. I understand that the Government of India do not favour the idea of a railway from Quetta to Seistan. The Russians are at this moment anxious about an alleged concession to an English syndicate for a railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz. Such a line could not, I think, pay its expenses. A route mioffit possibly be found from the Karun to Ispahan and the north. The Baghdad line seems to offer a chance. The Germans have done no work on this road, and their concession, unless secretly renewed, has m reality lapsed. I shall endeavour if the chance occurs to me to get some hold on this road, without incurring any embarrassing obligations. It seems to me that it might nossiblv be wnrth while to send from India an officer accustomed to the work of frontier lines to look over the several routes and make suggestions His Burneys might, of course, excite the suspicion of the Russians, but I do not know that this would do much harm. In the meantime I presume that Her MatetVs Government would prefer that the Persian agreement with Kussia prohibiting railway construction should not be renewed. It expnes this. year. I am not at all sure that the Russians wish to renew it for it seems easier for them to build paying railways than for any one else, hut I should be gla hnow the Majesty 'enh^^^ Sadr hAzam then assured me that the Shah was very much opposed to the renewal of the agreement. There iss one “^Sy^ainedThe^Stion Xthe Telegraph Depart- rnentt' Persia and on .the Peraian^ulf. ^ ^74'?^ as a means of obtaining m e i 0 en &gt; in other ways as well.

We should try to construct the proposed land line from Kuhsan to the Kalat frontier, and should connect it or get the Persian Govern ment to connect it through Seistan with Meshed. Eventually it should also be connected with the coast. I think we ought also to pay our Director better than we do. He ranks here next to the Minister, and he cannot maintain his position on a salary of £950 a year. The Manager of the Imperial Bank gets more than three times this sum. It is important that the Director should be on good terms with the Persian Ministers and notables, and be able to entertain them to some extent, and he should also be able to move about the country decently equipped. I will go into this matter separately and in detail, if Her Majesty’s Government or the Government of India are prepared to accept the principle that the Telegraph Department should be regarded in some sense as a political organisation, and that some expense may legitimately be incurred to make it more efficient in that respect. I have now stated the main proposal which I have to make for improving our position in Persia. It is briefly that we should increase the numbers and efficiency of our Consular staff by the addition of certain Consulates and Vice-Consulates, and by improving the position of our representatives in Tabriz and Ispahan ; that we should open out roads in the Karun district and elseivhere, and possibly prospect for a railway; and that we should organise the Telegraph Department for political purposes. But, as I said before, this despatch should be regarded as supplementary to my memorandum of 1895, which went fully into the question of our position in Persia. I would again request that reference may be made to that memo randum, and that the proposals therein made may be considered. There are one or two to which I should like to refer again. In the penultimate paragraph I wrote :—“ The Persian Government should be made to understand that they must not trifle with us in the future, as they have occasionally done in the past, but we should try to gain their good-will and help them in any way we can.” In a former paragraph I had explained how the Persians relying on our for bearance were inclined at times to treat us with disregard, and I suggested that we should take certain measures to correct their attitude in this respect. I recommended that, on the other hand, a loan should be granted to Persia upon easy terms. I think we should adhere to the principle of these recommend ations. As present the Persians think we have lost interest in things Persian ; that we will do nothing for them, and that we will not take the trouble to resent anything they do against us. I should like to disabuse their minds of both of these ideas. I may perhaps with advantage give one or two instances of what I mean. I noticed in my memorandum of 1895 the case of the island of Siri, which the Persians occupied some years ago, and have since retained iu spite of our protest. I noticed also the case of the Perso-Baluch border, where the Persians were constantly encroaching: and I explained the necessity for exercising some check upon the selection of Governors in the south of Persia. In these two latter cases we have succeeded in changing the attitude of the Persian Government. The border has been delimited, and in a recent instance an obnoxious Governor was recalled from Bushire on our demand. This has done much good. But cases still occur in wdiich our interests and our represent ations are treated with small respect. Eor example, the Persian Government, during my absence on leave, asked the Military Attache in this Eegation, to arbitrate in an important dispute between our native Agent in Kermanshah and some Persian subjects. The Persian Eoreign Minister undertook in writing to execute the award whatever it might be. The award was given in Decern^ her of 1897, and in spite of continuous pressure from the Legation execu tion has been evaded up till now, every sort of frivolous pretext being advanced to put us off. In another arbitration case, which occurred durino- my absence on leave, Mr. Hardinge agreed to abide by the award of the Prime Minister. The award provided for the transfer of certain mines from the 16s P «T Orkney wMch^td S°a aDd ^ f« t0 h!a of ^ain other high officials. The mines were at oncTtransfeTOd bu^Sif lmSter never been paid. Again the Imnerinl p . , d ’ 1 bu !; tlle money lias LlTgJnZte y6t b “ t k '-e fo^ ^“ssued ations have been made on the TubjecCX 1 ^ have just heaid that several thousand notes have been printed in En-land on behalt of one of these associations, and that they are now on then wav to T do h n r nt a 1 S f aU SaW theS f ^ se P ai ' atel y for orders, and in the meantime 1 do not ask tor any general ruling or assurance on the part of Her Maiesty’s Government with regard to our future treatment of such matters, but I have thought it desirable to bring the point to notice, in order that the attitude of the I ersian (government towards us may he clearly understood. On the. other hand, if the Persians are again anxious for a loan, and if they can satisfy us that the money will be properly spent, and not “ eaten ” by the chief officials, I would secure them a loan on easy conditions, relying for the payment of instalments, not on material guarantees of the usual type, such as would satisfy the Stock Exchange, hut on the great power we have of putting pressure upon the Persian Government. To insist upon material guarantees of the usual type is, I fear, to defeat our object. In the despatch No. 135 from the Government of India of the 11 th of August 1898, the following passages occur:— tc The recent arrangement whereby receivers of the Imperial Bank of Persia were to encash all customs duties at Bushire and Kermanshah, and to have also the right to see that the duties are duly levied, appears likely, if established to prove an important step towards developing the natural resources of Persia, and increasing British influence.” “ We have recently heard of the resignation of the Amin-ed-Dowleh, on whom the title of Sadr-i-Azam was conferred as lately as last December, and from whom and from his colleagues so much was apparently hoped for in the direction of reforms. We are as yet without precise information as to the significance or cause of the Sadr-i-Azam’s resignation. The fact is that the cause of the late Sadr-i-Azam’s resignation, or rather removal, was precisely the arrangement for the control of the customs duties. Unable to find any money for the daily expenses of the Shah and the conduct of the administration, and feeling that his retention in power depended upon his doing: so, the unfortunate Sadr-i-Azam very reluctantly accepted the otter of a small loan from the Imperial Bank, and put their receivers m charge of the customs. The measure was intensely unpopular among the Persian merchants, who had to pay their customs dues, and among the officials at head quarters who resented the interference of the Peringi. The Sadr-i-Azam was rudWd—cedfor having “sold Bushire to the English’ , and m a few weeks he was dismissed from office. He is now living m seclusion at Tehran never leaving his house, and his lifelong rival beeil any ' “» *— O— -* sr* “ iniluential persons, and of driving them into the arms of Eussia. These words are just as true now estly recommend that we ^' ld h ^ n g the Persians to a loan, we should avoid we contemplate at any time nei P « Customs Houses. A clause pro- insisting upon the immedmte cont ol^of t^lTon the loan are not paid, viding that control e ^ re nuirc The Customs Houses at Bushire, is, I think, the utmost that we retpine. ^‘e 17Lin gall and Bunder Abbas, through which passes yearly over three millions of trade, lie under the guns of our ships, and we could at any time put a boat’s crew and a Bank Agent in possession of each, even if we had no agreement at all. In my opinion therefore we can guarantee a loan, and thus let Persia have money at very low interests, and put her under a real obligation without any appreciable risk. I hope that this view of the case will be considered by Her Majesty’s Government, and that we shall, in the case of another loan being contemplated, rely on our power rather than on material guarantees. I doubt whether that power is fully recognised by ourselves. The Persians have no doubt of it. They see that our frontier, that is the frontier of Kalat and sea, not to speak of Afghanistan, marches with theirs for something like fifteen hundred miles. They know very well that the Bussians cannot help them in the south and south-east: and that in the Gulf provinces such show of authority as they still exercise depends upon our forbearance, if not upon our support. Por example, the port of Lingah is now in possession of a revolted Arab Sheikh, whom the Persians have recognised as Governor. They have no power to coerce him, and begged me to send a gun-boat to do so. He would most gladly hoist our flag to-morrow. On the Karun also the Arabs are in possession, and ready at a word from us to throw off the semblance of Persian supremacy. The Gulf ports—Mohammerah, Bushire, Lingah, Bunder Abbas—are at the mercy of our ships. So great is the respect of the Persians for our power that even in the extreme north of our zone, among the fanatical townbred population of Ispahan, any demonstration on our part has immediate effect. Two or three years ago there was trouble in Ispahan, and the Mullas were stirring up mischief against the Europeans. It happened that at this moment a British squadron was sent into Turkish waters, and news of the movement was brought to Persia by the public telegrams. The Missionary Bishop at Ispahan wrote to inform me that the hostile demonstrations against the Europeans had ceased at once, and that the attitude of the Mullas had completely changed. He said that the change was caused by the news about our fleet, which was apparently interpreted as an indication that the English were g( tting angry. Almost equal sensitiveness was shown last year when the news of the battle of Omdurman became known. It spread like wildfire all over the country, and was the common subject of conversation not only at the capital, but in remote villages of Persian-Baluch istan, where the markedly respectful attitude of the people attracted the notice of our officers. I mention these facts to show that we are greatly feared in Persia, and that consequently we can with ease make our wishes respected. The reason why the Persians often disregard them is what I have mentioned before, that they think our forbearance is practically unlimited. But whenever they see that we are in earnest, and that Her Majesty’s Government is interested in a case, the Shah and his Ministers speedily become convinced of the necessity for meeting our wishes. I would ask Her Majesty’s Government to believe that we have still great power and reputation in Persia. Having such power we can afford both to be decided in insisting upon our legitimate interests, and to be sympathetic and easy in our terms if the Persians ask us for help, pecuniary or other. We can also do something to check Bussian encroachments. In my memorandum of 1895 I suggested our letting it be understood that aggressive action by Bussia in the north of Persia would immediately result in decided action by us in the south. I still think that this is our proper policy. I do not mean that we should bully or unduly threaten the Persian Government, but I would let them understand that we cannot regard without concern any such action as, for example, the pushing down of the Bussian sanitary wedge towards Seistan, and that we shall, if these things happen, ask for conpeusations which the Persian Government may dislike. It is easy to do this, and it may help the Persian Government to resist demands which otherwise they would find it difficult to avoid accepting. I think they should realise that any serious concession made in the north is likely to involve an equivalent concession in the south. Hitherto they have realised only the converse of the proposition, 18position in the country. w/ TT r , 1 have written regarding b ps which should be taken to improve our is exceedingly bad, worse in snTnp vocmo/^ tl, n „Ti le 1 «, ( ? r ^ 1 , C0 .? ditlon of Nevertheless the internal condition of Persia is hy no meens hopeless, her debt being practically nothing, and her resources considerable. And although itusia has been active in some respects, we still hold a strong position. Our trade and our influence are completely dominant up to the Khanikin-Seistan line; and though oui trade has suffered in the north, it is still alive. Our bank does business all over Persia, and is the only bank that can legally issue notes. Our Telegraph Department controls a large part of the Persian telegraph system. Our political influence is still great, even in the north, and our power is much feared. Still it cannot be denied that our position is threatened. To maintain and improve it we should increase by five or six the number of our English Consular officers, and should encourage them all to travel and know their districts. We should also improve the condition of our Consulates at Tabriz and Ispahan. We should try to open out new trade routes, and to make those which exist a little better than they are. Possibly we might prospect for a railway. We should also make more use of our Telegraph Department, trying to get into our hands as much of the Persian telegraph system as possible, and to have all our Consular posts in effective communication with Tehran. We should insist upon our interests being specially considered within our zone, that is up to the Khanikin-Seistan line. Amongst other thino-s we should exercise some unofficial control over the appointment and dismissal of the Persian Governors. We should be strict in keeping the Persians to their engagements and resisting injustice; but, on the other hand, having the power to coerce Persia very easily, we should be considerate in our dealings with her if she wants help, and, under certain circumstances, we should o-uarantee a loan for her, refraining at the same time from taking material guarantees of an unpalatable description, or forcing upon her reforms for which she is not prepared. We should decide now to recognise the Shahs eldest son if the Shah dies. Finally, we should let it be clearly understood that encroachment by Pussia in the north will entail concessions to us m the south. 19The second objection which may he urged is that our action would he resented hy the Russians and will lead to countermoves on their part. I fully recognise the force of this objection. No one can hare realised more clearly than I have done the inexpediency of provoking Russia hy an appearance of overactivity. I have repeatedly impressed this view upon our officers in Persia, and my memorandum of 1895 and later despatches, notably of August 14th, 1896, show how constantly the idea has been present in my mind. Nothing can he more foolish than fussy demonstrations, or attempts to gain small successes at the expense of the Russians; and except when active measures are necessary for the maintenance of our material interests, I would never advocate them. I have throughout recognised that our proper course in this country is to stand on the defensive and to avoid striking at the Russians, or performing any risky evolutions which might tempt them to fall upon us. But at the same time it seems to me that there must be limits to our caution in these respects, and that, if we are to maintain our position in Persia, we must be prepared to face a certain amount of displeasure on the part of the Russians. As I have shown in this despatch they do not remain inactive because we do so. Our absten tion, at the instance of the Government of India, from interference in Seistan, has not prevented them from pushing down to the Afghan frontier and trying to strangle our Indian trade, or from endeavouring with some success to establish their trade and influence in Seistan itself. Our studious friendliness in Tehran, though pleasantly reciprocated, does not prevent them from doing all they can to injure our Bank, the Russian “ Banque des Prets ” getting 'up runs upon if, and even the Russian Legation refusing its notes. Nor has our friendly attitude prevented them from establishing a Consulate in Ispahan, or pushing on the construction of the Resht road. Whether we remain quiet or not the Russians, very properly, go on working for their own hand, and unless we make an effort sooner or later we shall find ourselves being quietly elbowed out of one position after another. If we do not make the effort now, we certainly may provoke them to increased activity, but it may have a contrary effect, and in any case I believe that, if we keep strictly within our rights, and make no unnecessary demonstrations, we have no need to be afraid of what they can do. They ought not to be able to meet us on equal terms in our zone. Every Persian believes that sooner or later the country will be divided between England and Russia, and the Southerner, from the Zil-es-Sultan downwards, looks to coming under the rule of England. In a loosely knit country like Persia, the weak central Government cannot easilv override local influence In this respect it is fortunate for us that the 'Persians have fixed their capital so far north as Tehran. Even in Tehran, moreover, the influence of the Russians has its limits. Their geographical position makes them a threatening power in the north, and as most of the Government officials at Tehran are Northerners, with property and interests in the north, the influence _ of the Russians in Tehran is no noubt considerable. The northern official thinks it wise to keep on good terms with his future masters. But it must be remembered that the Persian lives from day to day, and thinks the country will probably last his time, and being inordinately conceited, not to say arrogant, the Persians are far from liking the Russians, whose overbearing ways they find it hard to endure. Altogether the Russians are not omnipo tent in Tehran, on the contrary, although the Persian Government is very much afraid of them, it still opposes to them a steady passive resistance about which they complain very bitterly. I he Shah and his advisers, who believe that we shall take the south, only if Russia takes the north, will go as far as they dare in helping us to resist Russian encroachment, and if we show that we are m earnest, I think they will go a long way. It must not be thought that they are entirely under Russian domination. They are not Therefore in my opinion we should make up our minds that the time has now come for us to lay down a definite line of policy in Persia, and that for the future we must adhere to it, without too much regard for any displeasure which we mav thereby cause to the Russians. ^ 20 Foreign Office Press—No. 818—1C-8-99—60.IBir_H.M.Durand presents his compliments to the Decretory to the Foreign Department of the -&lt;// /, ^ Government of India and with reference to his despatch FO:6 of February the I6th,I899 and telegram' to the T ‘iceroy of February the fOth,has the honour to transmit herewith copy of a memorandum on the situation in Persia drawn up in December 1895.

Some time ago I asked Lieutenant-Colonel Picot, Military Attache in Review of internal this Legation, who has acquired a considerable knowledge of Persia, to make a condltion « careful inquiry into the state of the administration, and to let me have all the information he could collect on a variety of points. I append to this Memorandum some interesting papers drawn up by him. Colonel Picot’s facts are, I believe, substantially correct, and though I see no prospect of the introduction of the drastic measures of reform which he recommends, his suggestions are of much value. I have also appended to this Memorandum a statement by Nawab Hasan Ali Khan, Oriental Secretary, [showing the revenues of Persia, and a note on the antecedents and character of the Sadr-i- Azam, or Prime Minister. These papers, and the Reports of my predecessors, afford so much information regarding the internal condition of Persia, and the state of her foreign relations, that it will be unnecessary for me to enter upon a detailed examination of the circumstances which I find surrounding me. It will be enough for any proposals I may have to make if 1 set out the leading facts. 3. There is no doubt that judged by European standards, the internal Finances, condition of Persia is very unsatisfactory. The Governorships of provinces and other high posts are systematically sold by the Shah to the highest bidder, and sold for short periods, so that the country is plundered and the administration disorganized. The Central Government is weak, and is defied not only by the provincial authorities, but by the Mullas, or priesthood, whose power has become greater than it should be. The finances are in disorder, and during the last three years there has been an annual deficit of about 50,000/. Heavy arrears of pay are due to Army, the troops and the civil establishments. The army is a worthless rabble, without serviceable arms or drill, or the semblance of discipline. There are no trustworthy Courts of Justice | jhere are practically no roads, so that the Oj V/ expansion of trade is greatly hampered f finally, the country is being flooded Depreciation of with copper money, which is causing much loss and suffering to the poorer currency ° classes, and is giving rise to bread riots. Among the principal causes of this state of affairs are the greed and timidity of the Shah. It is his want of Greed and timiditj of firmness and courage that has led to the regrettable increase in the power of Shah ’ the priesthood, for whom the Persians have little love, and his perpetual [ 668 ] ®The Shah’s sons.

Having everj thing in his own control, he draws from various sources an income generally estimated at something between 70,0G0Z. and 100,000/. a-year; and the removal of anj administrative abuse would almost inevitably deprive him of a portion of this sum. The Sadr-i-Azam declares that the profits of his various offices go ^.o his relatives and subordinates, not to himself; but this, if true, seems to mate little practical difference. I am afraid the Sadr-i-Azam can only be regarded as himself a serious obstacle to all reform. Finally, it must t&gt;e pointed out that the failings of the men now in power are not solely responsible for the piesent state of the country. The Administration is, and lias been foi geneiations, corrupt right through. The first idea of every Persian official is illicit gain. Ho doubt the proceedings of the Shah and others who ought to set an example tend, to increase the prevailing corruption, but they have not created it. Its roots lie deep in the national character. Of all the Asiatics with whom I have had to deal, the Persians appear to me to he the most shameless liars and thieves.! And there is no patriotism upon which one can work. Patriotism is replaced here by national conceit, 'which makes the Persians look down with contempt upon all other countries, but will not make them sacrifice the smallest personal interest for the good of their own. Altogether it cannot he denied that the internal condition of Persia is far from promising. 4. The outlook with regard to her relations with foreign Powers is, from our point of view, not much more satisfactory. Though so feeble as to be at the mercy of almost any assailant, Persia is inclined to adopt towards all Powders hut one an aggressive and peremptory tone. She encroaches steadily on the frontiers of Kelat, Afghanistan, and Turkey, and her reliance on the good nature of England is so complete that she frequently permits herself to treat our representations with neglect, and even at times with a careless levity amounting to contempt. Towards Russia, on the other hand, her attitude is one of respect and fear. * * The Shah s methods of collecting money from private individuals are numerous, and at times amusing.

As almost all the leading men at the heaa-quarters of the Government are northerners, and as the capital itself is in the north, this has a very marked effect upon policy. The Shah and his .o\eminent seem to be constantly haunted and oppressed by the sense of their proxml my to liussia. d’hcrc can, in fact, be no doubt that in Tehran the influence of Russia is predominant, and I am afraid there can be no doubt that m is antagonistic to our own. I may add that, according to general belief, the influence of Russia is steadily exerted to thwart any measure of reform or progiess m Persia to prevent anything which could tend to strengthen and sOxiduy the country, and arrest its downward course. 5. 1 his is one aspect of the case, and it must be admitted that, both with regard to the internal condition of Persia and with regard to her foreign relations, we have some ground for disquieting thought. The Sadr-i-Azam, when in-one of his dismal moods, is fond of saying that all is hopeless that there is not a gleam of light anywhere. But there is something to he said on the other side, and I will state briefly what seem to me to he the more hopeful features of the case. 6 . In the first place, with regard to the internal condition of the country, it seems to me that the prevailing disorganization is not in itself of a desperate natuie. It is true that things are out of order, from the European point of view, but 1 doubt whether they are much more out of order than they ordinarily are in an Asiatic State. In some w T ays there has been a considerable advance in Persia during the last twenty years. For example, trade lias increased, and a more or less regular system of posts and telegraphs has been established. Judged by an Asiatic standard, Persia is, in fact, not very far gone. I have seen native States in India in a worse condition, and have seen them rapidly recover prosperity when taken in hand by the Indian Government. Though the finances are in disorder, Persia has great natural resources, and practically no debt. That is the foundation of everything, and a capable official, with some power of organization, could, in a few' years, if given a free hand and supported by the Shah, make Persia a very flourishing country. The people, with all their falseness, are intelligent and docile. They are obedient to their Shah, whom they regard as the first monarch in the world, and their lazy good temper, and want of fanaticism, make them easy to manage. Even the recurring deficits are not so serious a matter in Persia as they would be else where. Every one is accustomed to irregularity in the payment of salaries, and the salary of a Persian forms a comparatively unimportant part of his income. Salary or no salary, he makes his living somehow—the soldier chiefly by money- lending, and the civil official by extortion of various kinds, A considerable part of the deficit, too, is caused by the existence of an excessive pension list; and wdien the Treasury is short of money the pensions are not paid—-which is rather an advantage than otherwise.* Altogether, though the condition of Persia is certainly more or less dangerous, it is not, in my opinion, really desperate—not such that one need look for an immediate or very speedy dissolution from internal causes. If the Persians ivere left to themselves they would probably get along well enough in their own slovenly way for generations to come, and a very moderate measure of reform would make the country as prosperous as it ever need he. 7. Again, though Russian influence is the strongest foreign influence in Tehran, and though it is generally believed that Russia is cynically working for the ruin of the country,f yet it is very evident that the influence of Russia is by no means exclusive or unlimited. It may be stated with tolerable accuracy that no other European Continental nation carries any weight at all in Persia, but England undou btedly carries great wei ghty CHavmg regardTo the geographical position oFRussia, it seems to strange that w T e should be as strong as we are. In spite of the indifference m( * It is said that for less than one year’s payment made to himself the Shah will often continue a lapsed pension for another life.

Political developments in Europe, the effect of which we cannot calculate heie, may of course 1 make Russia decide at anytime to go to war with us, but, jud g merely from her attitude in Asia for some years past, I cannot but believe that she fears us, in Asia, quite as much as we fear her, and more than we ought to tear her. Even from Persia, where we have not a regiment, we could now, by a little judicious manoeuvring on the Turkoman frontier, arouse excitement and alarm from the Caspian to Merv. Hereafter, if, for example, a great wax .•mould clear the air in Eui’ope, and set Russia free, as sue was set free by the Ciimean War and the Turkish War, to devote herself to the East, and consolidate her recent advances, she may he willing to provoke ns in Asia. At present she does not seem to have any wish to do so; and, if this view is correct, there is no reason to anticipate any serious attempt on her part to disturb the existing situation in this country for some time to come. 8 . Supposing that the state of affairs is approximately as I have described it, the general conclusion would he that the internal condition of Persia is unsatisfactory, and to some degree dangerous, and that she is too much under the influence of Russia; hut that there is no cause for immediate alarm • 1 T 1 I I 1 on the influence ot Russia; hut that there is no cause for immediate alarm either account, as the country may hold together for a long time if left to itself, and Russia does not seem to he inclined at present to enter upon any course of action which would bring her into serious conflict with us.

It may possibly he argued that things seem to be going fairly well as it is, and that practically we want nothing more in Persia than we have got, but such an argument would he quite untenable. Our position in Persia as a check upon Russian expansion is not an altogether bad one, hut it is not as good as it has been; and unless we are vigilant and careful to make use of our opportunities, it may easily become worse. It may become rapidly and seriously worse if Persia should fall into bankruptcy and disorder, and thereby afford to Russia legitimate or plausible ground for interference. Moreover, we have to think of Persia as a market for oui tiade. It is evident that from that point of view the existing situation leaves much to he desired. . desired. 0 . The first course which which at one time found Russia is itself is the radical change of policy - * — ,wv.c^w in Sir Henry Drummond Wolff. ~~ nob prepared to make any serious encroachment upon Persia, it an suggests advocate If occursP oss .^^ e we might come to a friendly understanding with her and that we might enter with her upon joint action for the reorganization and +w Ve i 3 n ^ en ^ coun try. Such a scheme is very attractive. At present el eisian Government plays off Russia and England against each other, with the result that neither can do much, and that Persia remains misruled and undeveloped. If once England and Russia fairly came together, we might divide Asia between us, and we could do anything we liked in Persia without the the smallest difficulty. A joint demand for the necessary reforms would be irresistible, and there would probably be no attempt at resisting it. A guaranteed loan, sufficient to permit of the reorganization of the finances and the construction or certain public works could be easily raised, and we could then proceed to open out the country by land and water communications, to extend the area of cultivation, to increase the revenue, and to create a con siderable trade. The country has so many natural advantages, and is in many ways so well off even now, that much detailed interference with the administration would not be required. A little steady pressure on certain main lines by the English and Russian Legations acting together would make Persia in a very few years a solvent, flourishing country, and in course of time it should become a comparatively rich oneA Both England and Russia would gain largely from a commercial point of view | put the question is whether Russia would ever fall in w T ith such a scheme, and whether, if so, we could hope to carry it out without disagreement and ultimate trouble. This seems to me unlikely. It is possible that the proposal, if made by us, might be accepted by Russia, especially if it formed part of a larger scheme for the general settlement of our relations in Asia. It may also be argued that if, when asked, Russia refused to join us in saving Persia from misrule and possible ruin, and developing a trade lucrative to herself, we should at least have made her show her hand. Hethertheless, I am inclined to think that it is very doubtful whether the experiment should be tried. My belief is that Russia would evade our proposal, and would make capital out of it at our expense by denouncing us to the Shah and his officials, who are all interested in maintaining the present state of things. If Russia did join, she would sooner or later play us false, and leave us to press alone unpalatable reforms which she would secretly oppose. Our ways are not her ways, and in the end we should probably be sorry we ever tried to work with her. She might perhaps agree to divide Persia with us, but I do not believe she would seriously help us in trying to regenerate Persia. It must be remembered, too, that the coercion of Persia by Russia and England in the manner indicated would tend to destroy in her all spirit of independence, and would accustom her to be treated as a subordinate State. That might be rather a dangerous lesson for us to teach her. Altogether, attractive as the scheme is at first sight, I do not think it holds out a good prospect of success. That, however, is a matter of opinion, and it might be worth while to sound the Russian Government as to the principle of the proposal. 11 . I have not tried to ascertain the views of the Russian Legation on this subject. The Russian Minister, M. de Blitzow, is a most agreeable man, but he is very reserved and cautious. He would not, I feel sure, commit himself to an opinion, and it would not probably be desirable for me to sound him unless authorized to do so. I have given him more than one opportunity of discussing Persian affairs in a friendly spirit, but he seems to be afraid of speaking to me on the subject. 12 . If we are not to try the experiment of coming to an understanding with Russia for the regeneration of Persia, it remains to be considered what we can do independently of her. At the outset of this inquiry we may, I suppose, put aside all idea of ousting or overcoming her influence, and of gaining an exclusive or predominant influence ourselves. It is true that Islam is still a living force. * The country about Tehran itself affords a good example of what might be done. Some little water is brought down by underground channels from the long line of mountains 6 or 7 miles away, and wherever it is used for irrigation fine trees and crops spring up; but the bulk of the water supply is allowed to run to waste. Every year, with the melting of the snows, brown torrents pour across the plain, cutting deep channels through the stony soil, and destroying the so-called roads, and making it almost impossible to take a carriage outside the rampart. A few well-built dams along the foot of the range would bring under cultivation a great stretch of fertile country now lying barren.—H. M. D.

V e must evidently be content for the present to aim at something less. , 3 Verv little I think, can be done to improve the position through the medium of countries other than Russia. The more foreign capital_ is invested in Persia the better, from one point of view. Everything of the kind tends to consolidate the country and draw upon it the attention of Em ope. But Persia is not in a condition to attract foreign capital, and until it does so foreign nations will not trouble themselves about it. I have found the Reiman, Austiian, and Belgian Legations very friendly, and nave received help, from them in minor matters ; but for all practical purposes England and Russia are the only Powers represented in Tehran. We must depend on ourselves for anything we want to do in this country.* 14. That being the case, we must, I fear, resign the hope of carrying any general scheme of reform, and making Persia a well-ruled, flourishing country. Some administrative improvements we may gradually succeed in introducing, but the task will not be an easy one, for even if Russia does not oppose us, evei^ reform must involve damage to powerful vested interests, and there is apparently no one in Persia who has a real patriotic desire to set matters straight. For example, the sale of Governorships is the cause of untold oppression. Our great friend, the Firman Farma, was recently appointed to the Governor ship of Kerman. For this appointment he had to pay to the Shah 10,000/., to the Sadr-i-Azam 2 , 000 /., and to others smaller sums. These gifts will have to be repeated, perhaps increased, next March, if he is to keep his place for another year, tie is now said to be squeezing the people very hard to recoup himself and provide the State revenue, and the same thing is going on all over the country. But it is useless for us to advocate the proper payment of officials and the abandonment of the farming system, while the Shah and the Sadr-i- Azam have both so much to gain by it. Nothing short of a joint authoritative demand by England and Russia could suffice. The Shah makes, perhaps, 100,000/. a-year in this way, and the Sadr-i-Azam from 10,000/. to 20,000/. Take another example—the army. One of the first necessities in Persia is a body of trustworthy troops to support the authority of the Government. But any attempt at reform in the army touches the Shah’s favourite son, who makes a large sum yearly by leaving the troops in arrears of pay, and miserably clothed, and without arms. But if we urged the regular payment of the troops the Shah would not press his son, and the Russians, with whom he is on very friendly terms, would probably support him against our interference. Again, the immoderate issue of copper coin,or “black money ” as the Persians call it is doing much harm, and may lead to serious trouble. The reason given ± 01 ’ this unfortunate proceeding is that after paying the “pishkesh” demanded by the Shah for the farm of the Mint, which amounts to 26 0001 a-year, it is impossible to coin silver at a profit. This, I believe, is true but the matte! is further complicated by the discovery that the real farmer of the Mint is the Sadr-i-Azam who, m conversation with me, denounces the iniquity of the bhah m extorting this payment and ruining the country q 7 ,, . A , s °. n f m °re instance of the difficulty of doing anything for tlm reform of the Administration, I would cite the caseV the Customs GherelsnoTubt RussLtUyftt vamJ-Thhfr ° n , PU f il t0 “ e 1 first cam&lt;! to Tehran: 1 . g me , the lest of us look on and mark the points.” H. M. D “ You and thethat the Persian Customs, properly managed, would yield far more than they do, but the Sadr-i-Azam farms them from the Shah, and gives about 200 , 000 /. a-year for them. By sub-letting them himself he makes a profit of about 45,000/. a-year. b^aturally, any real reform of the Customs system, which would result in the loss of this sum, must be a severe blow to him, though he says his brother and his subordinates intercept the money. These examples will perhaps suffice to show how difficult it would be for us to effect any radical reforms in the Persian Administration. By pressing for them inconsiderately we run the risk, not only of failure, but of making ourselves disliked by the Shah and the Sadr-i-Azam and other influential persons, and of driving them into the arms of Russia. 15. The sphere of our possible action is therefore restricted within comparatively narrow limits. We could, no doubt, by appealing to the cupidity of the Shah, get a certain amount done. He will do almost anything for money. We might, for example, if we secured him a loan which would enable him to pay off the Regie debt, and to keep a large sum of money for himself, induce him to hand over to us the management of his Southern Customs, and to let us try reorganizing his finances. But any such scheme involves, I fear, the downfall of the Sadr-i-Azam, hitherto regarded as our one strong friend in Persia, and before he fell he would fight desperately, backed by the Russian Legation. He is not an altogether blameless Minister according to European standards, and at times he has been far from satisfactory in his dealings with us. It is possible, as some believe, that since 1892 he has secretly gone over to Russia, but he certainly was with us once, and did much to further our interests, and though not a good administrator, he is probably as good as others, while he is personally most pleasant to deal with.. So long as he seems inclined to be friendly it would, I think, be a mistake to force him into opposition for the sake of introducing reforms which might after all prove impracticable. I believe it would not be very difficult to overturn him, and in some ways the Shah would be more manageable than he is; but it is better, in my opinion, to leave him in undisturbed enjoyment of the income he makes by ruling the country after Persian methods, and to confine ourselves to the objects which we may hope to attain with his co-operation. 16. Being unable to put forward any general scheme for the reorganization of Persia, or to advocate pressure on our part for the institution of any radical reforms, I can only recommend that we should adhere to the line of policy which we have followed with more or less energy for many years past. Our efforts will then be mainly directed to preserving the integrity of Persia, gaining the good-will, respect, and confidence of the Persian Government and people, supporting Persia to resist intimidation, watching the proceedings of the Russians, developing our trade with Persia, and taking any opportunities which may occur for advocating measures beneficial to the country. It remains to consider what particular means we should adopt for the accomplishment of these objects. 17. As to maintaining the integrity of Persia, I have already mentioned the widespread belief that at the death of the present Shah Russia will make some serious forward move. I doubt it greatly ; but I think we should admit the possibility that she may have something of the kind in contemplation, and should as far as possible guard against it. Though the Shah appears to be in excellent health, he is no longer a young man, and he tries his constitution in various ways. It would be as well to prepare beforehand for his death, so that when it comes we may know exactly what to do. Russia has more than once given an assurance that she desires to maintain the integrity of Persia, and both Russia and England have in one way or another recognized the Vali Ahd as his father’s heir. I think it would be desirable to arrange with the Russians a scheme of action to be adopted by us both in case the Shah should die in the Yali Ahd’s lifetime. A joint declaration by Russia and England in favour of the Yali Ahd immediately on the Shah’s death would, I believe, suffice to deter the brothers, here and at Ispahan, from any attempt to seize the throne, but we should settle beforehand what we are going to do, and should show the Russians that we are not indifferent in the matter. If the British and Russian Legations received general instructions on this point they could concert details here, and submit their views for approval. The question is whether Russia and England agree to support the claim of the Yali Ahd to succeed at his lather s Restriction of sphere of British action.

Sfall the Vah Ahd is not honeiessly in Russian hands. He has been to some extent strengthened of late by 1 the Firman Firma, his kinsman, and our most open adherent in Peisia. He has also taken into his seryice an English doctor, and has stuck to him in spite of all the efforts of the Russian Consulate; and some ofihe most important of his Azerbaijan officials haye of late incurred the severe displeasure of the Russians, so that there is hope even of them. I saw something of His Royal Highness when he was here a few months ago, and I found that, though not prepossessing, he had his good qualities. He is less dishonest and less cruel than his brothers, and more open-handed than the Shah. He is also on the best of terms with the Sadr-i-Azam. If he lives to succeed he will probably make a better Shah than his father, and I see no reason why he should he more in Russian hands, unless he has already entangled, himself m some secret engagement, of which I can find no indication. In these circumstances, it seems to me desirable to get on goon terms with the Yali Ahd, and to increase our influence over him as much as possible. He has been sore at our decorating his brother, and the Sadr-i-Azam thinks we should do well to give him the Grand Cross of the Bath. In spite of the evident objections to so doing, I should be inclined to recommend this if it were not for the recent riots at Tabriz, which are due to the misgovernment of his officials and his own weakness. This would be a bad time to decorate him/but there are two things which I think we ought to do. The English doctor is very anxious to he made Surgeon to the Consulate-General, and to get an allowance of 150/. a-year for the appointment. His pay is low, and the Yali Ahd is poor, and, unless we give the allowance, I fear Dr. Adcock may he forced to leave him. This would be a great pity, for Dr. Adcock is a well-meaning man, and it is important to us to have an Englishman always at the Yali Ahd’s elbow. If the Yali Ahd dies before his father, which is not unlikely, the allowance will not have cost us much, if he lives to succeed the money will have been well spent. Secondly, I think the allowances of the Consul-General at Tabriz should be increased by at least 200/. a-year. At present they are not sufficient to enable our Consul-General to keep up his position. The statement appended to this Memorandum will show how unfavourably they compare with those of his Russian, French, and Turkish colleagues. We ought, I think, to give our Consul-General as much as the French give their Representative. ^ If the inciease cannot he managed in any other way, I would recommend the reduction of the pay at Resht, where there is comparatively little to do. It is really important that at the head-quarters of the Heir-Apparent to the Persian footing 6 the ° ffiCial Wh ° haS Chaige ° f 0111 interests should be on a proper i 11 ^ , t ? ie 1 ll ^ ve su gg e sted we shall do something to strengthen our hold on the A all Ahd, and to prepare for the future.

At any rate the Russians and Persians should, I think, understand that any encroachment by Russia in the north will result in our taking such measures as we may consider necessary to make sure of the Persian Gulf ports. This should act as a deterrent.* 18.

I) . rv 1 1 ° 1 cimr ui tile Reisian Government and people. This may seem a somewhat vague object to set before us, but the words are not meaningless. All over Persia we do now enjoy a considerable measure of good-will and respect and confidence, and there are definite means of strengthening those feelings, which are of practical use to us. In the large towns we are perhaps no better liked than other foreigners, but in the country generally the English name still stands high. As an illustration of this I may mention an incident which occurred here a few days ago. The local Governor of a district near Hamadan is, like other Persian Governors, making haste to be rich, and in so doing he has fallen foul of an old Chieftain from the Kurd border. This man, who refused to pay as much as the Governor wanted, and who was possibly, as alleged, in the habit of lifting his neighbours’ cattle, was recently surprised by a body of 600 horsemen, who burned his villages, seized his property, and killed some of his people—men and women. He made good his escape after a running fight, and, leaving the country with his son and one or two attendants, he rode straight to this Legation, a distance of perhaps 250 miles, and claimed the protection of the British flag. He said he had heard that the English insisted on justice to all. He has now received assurances from the Shah and Sadr-i-Azam, and has gone away happy. A fact of that kind is not without meaning, and the reports of English officers who travel among the Turkomans, Bakhtiaris, and other wild tribes show clearly that at present they entertain very friendly feelings towards us. If we show more interest in them we shall strengthen those feelings, and throughout Persia we can win over men to our side if we choose to try. For example, the establishment of a Consulate at Kerman, and the appointment to it of Mr. Sykes, has been a very good move. Mr. Sykes is a capable, manly young officer of just the right stamp. He has attached firmly to our interests one of the most important men in Persia, the Eirmaii Eirma, and has acquired a great reputation for himself among the country people. It will strengthen our influence materially if we have more/of this kind in other parts of Persia as occasion offers, and if our Representatives at Bushire and Ispahan and Khorassan are encouraged to travel and make friends among the Chiefs and * Not long ago the Sadr-i-Azam said to me that he did not believe Russia and England would evei* divide Persia between them, because the Russians were too greedy; they wanted the Gulf, and would rather wait any time for that than take only a part of Persia, and let us have part.— H.

As to the Persian Government, I feel sure we aheady enjoy then confidence in so far that they believe we mean them no harm, but they think we are selfish, and not inclined to do much for them Iheir respect 1 do not think we enjoy as fully as we ought to do; at least they have peculiar nays of showing it. I have been much surprised at the peremptory tone in which the Persian officials have at times permitted themselves to address this Legation, and at the semi-contemptuous carelessness with which ^in. other cases our repeated representations have been ignored or evaded. This may have been due to various causes: to over-centralization and overwork; to Oriental laziness; to the overweening conceit of the Persians, and their fondness for showing off’; to the belief in our inexhaustible good nature. But whate\er the cause, such behaviour should not he passed over. It is a mistake, from a practical point of view, to stand any want of respect from Asiatic Governments. I have therefore selected two instances in which it seemed to me that v’e had not been properly treated by the Persian Government, and have pressed these somewhat seriously upon their notice. One case, in which the Persian Government directly refused to abstain from aggression on a disputed frontier district, and was generally troublesome, I have already reported at length. In the other instance I found that a number of claims justly advanced by British merchants and others, and supported by this Legation, had been allowed to remain for years unsettled, and that some of the Shah’s principal Ministers, including the Minister of Justice and Commerce, and the President of the Council, were personally interested in defeating them. This seemed a very useful case to take up, and the Sadr-i-Azam declaring himself unable to overcome the resistance of the influential persons concerned, I brought the matter to the notice of the Shah. The result was that although the Minister of Justice and Commerce tendered his resignation, the Shah, who can make himself obeyed when he chooses, insisted upon a proper settlement of each claim, and they were all cleared off.* I hope that these two eases will have a good effect in Tehran. My view is that, while treating the Persian Government with all possible courtesy, we should not allow them to trifle with us. We should, I think, do all we can to 'show our interest in Persia, and our desire for her welfare, but the Government of this country, which may he said to depend for its very existence upon our support, should he made to understand that any representation we may make must be treated seriously. A little wholesome fear, mixed with confidence m our intentions, will tend to make the relations between the res very much more satisfactory than they are at present. As to securing the goodwill 1 x xiA can do for them. The Shah For instance, Persians and ourselves 21 . is what we to answer. Government, w j Lucm niej' cue at present, ■will of the Persian Government, the question This question, unfortunately, is only too easy the Sadr-i-Azam, who constitute the Persian mt practically nothing from us but money. The Shah and no ' imp or tan t'matter o'tci Mm^or disaosa &lt; l bSer H lng ^ ^ iS by n ° meanS a “ Roi faineant.” All He regards his officials as mere bop, andGaohes^tUe^alue d! 0 ™^ 0 ”' \ ' rdon )fc \vould wish us to support him in case the Bussians made any inconvenient demand, and the Sadr-i-Azam will perhaps he gdad of our backing if he gets mto^ tiouhle again with the Shah, hut these are contingencies about which neitiier greatly troubles himself. What both really want us to do now is to relieve them or the burden of the Begic debt, and then let them alone to rule the country as they, please. The Shah regarded the debt from the beginning as a hateful extortion, and he resents it doubly now, when the fall of silver has largely increased the value in krans of the payment which has to be made. He thinks we could relieve him from the payment if we chose, and that if we n ere really friendly we would do so. He does not believe that Her Majesty’s Government is powerless to set aside the claims of a trading Company, and he never will believe it. The Sadr-i-Azam understands the question much better, but he also considers that we ought to help him. His argument is that the Shah never gives him a day’s peace about the matter, but reproaches him incessantly for having introduced the Regie, and says that he is personally responsible for the debt, and must find the money. The Sadr-i-Azam points out that it is most difficult for him to do this, and urges that, as his support of our schemes has brought him into the trouble, the least we can do is^to come to his assistance. His Highness forgets that our support has probably helped to keep him so long in power, but it is, I think, natural that he should feel as he does, and that both he and the Shah should be rather sore on the subject, for we pressed the Regie strongly upon them. The sum to be paid yearly is not large from our point of view, but the revenue of Persia is little more than 1 , 000 , 000 /.,* and the yearly deficit of late having been about 50,000/., the payment of over 40,000/. moref as interest on the loan is a not inconsiderable tax. I need hardly explain that, as the pay of officials and soldiers is in arrear, the Regie debt does not make us more popular in Persia. There are always plenty of people to point out that the revenues of the country are being eaten by the Feringi, while the Persian is denied his due. 22 . I do not know whether the good-will of the Persian Government is regarded as a matter of sufficient importance to make us incur any pecuniary obligation on behalf of it; nor do I know whether it would be practicable to come to any understanding with the Regie shareholders; but what would greatly relieve the Sadr-i-Azam, and probably enable us to gain considerable advantages for ourselves, would be the taking over of the debt on proper security, and the reduction of the interest to 3 or 4 per cent. This would save the Persian Government some thousands of pounds a-year; it would look well in Persian eyes; it would apparently cost us nothing, as we could borrow the money at a lower rate ; and it would put into our hands a very useful lever, bho doubt we might find ourselves in the more or less invidious position of having to press for the payment of interest to ourselves, but practically that is the position now, for each instalment has to be extracted from the Sadr-i- Azam by this Legation. We should incur no greater odium if the money were for ourselves, and if we made judicious terms as to the repayment of the principal, we might materially increase our hold on the Persian Government. They would, I think, give us almost any security we liked to ask, so long as we confine ourselves to the south, [j: I must admit that such a measure would not suffice to restore the finances of Persia to an orderly condition, but it would be a sensible relief, and I greatly fear that unless something of the kind is done the effect may be to alienate the Sadr-i-Azam, who has undoubtedly been more or less sore with us since the Regie days. I fear also that the end of the thing may be an appeal to the Russians. They are apparently not unwilling to lend Persia money, and the Sadr-i-Azam has warned me that he will not be able to prevent the Shah from coining to terms with them if we do not help him. This may be .merely an attempt to frighten us, but I believe there is truth in what the Sadr-i-Azam * It ought to ba nearly a million and a-half, but of late years the revenues are not being realized in full.—H.

We cannot be too frank in these ways m dealing with the Persians, who have no fine feelings about money matters, and whose way is to take all they can get, and if possible give nothing m return. 24. As to trade advantages, the difficulty is to obtain xrom ciadeis them selves any comprehensive proposals for the general good of British commerce. The improvement of the very rough road between Bushire and fehiraz would be a good thing, and so no doubt would be the opening out of internal loads by which the produce of the country districts would be tapped. But 1 can think of no important objects to be gained other than roads, and the Peisian Government have no money to spend upon public woiks of this kind. They have not 20 yards of respectable road in Tehran itself, where the main thorough fares are very bad indeed for wheeled traffic. The opening of the Upper Karun, and the establishment of a commercial centre at Shuster, would, I suppose, be a considerable gain, especially if the dam at Ahwaz could be repaired, and if transhipment at that place could be obviated by a system of locks. But English firms would have to find the money for this, recouping themselves by the sale of water to irrigate the surrounding country, and I cannot speak with confidence of the results of such an undertaking. 25. Trading matters apart, I think that the grant of pecuniary help to the Persian Government would give us a good opportunity for asserting ourselves more strongly in Southern Persia. I would press for a delimitation of the Perso-Beiuch frontier. Perso-Bcluch frontier, where Persia is constantly encroaching, and I would insist upon the withdrawal of the Persian flag from the Island of Sirri, if the Indian Government appear to Her Majesty’s Government to have made out a clear case. I would also let it be understood that, in view of our large interests in Southern Persia, we expect the Persian Government to show some consideration for our wishes in such questions as the appointment or removal of Governors. ATe could hardly make this an official claim, or a condition of any help given to the Persian Government, but they used to consult us in such cases, and I should like to he authorized to bring about an^bfficial under standing on the subject. We ought not to have objectionable men forced upon us in Bushire or such places simply because they have bid a little higher than the rest. I do not think there would he much difficulty in exercising some check upon had selections if it were known that Her Majesty’s Government took some interest in the matter. Ho thing would give ns greater weight in Southern Persia than the knowledge that if a Governor were not acceptable to us he would not be appointed. A few years ago this was practically the case, and I should like to see so satisfactory an arrangement again in force. 26. Even in the matter of administrative reform it seems to me just possible that the grant of pecuniary help to Persia may enable us to do some sensible good. ^ I have no doubt whatever of this if pecuniary help were granted on a consuleiable scale. Bor example, the reform of the currency is X feel sure, simply a question of bribing the Shah. If his present pishkesb Increase of influence in Southern Persia.

The Shah’s concessions, in fact, would be limited by nothing but his fears, by the threats of e Russians, or the prospect of a popular outbreak. It is difficult to put this point too plainly. I presume, however, that Her Majesty’s Government would not care to But drastic reform enter upon a policy of the kind I have, described, or to lend the Shah a million feiuf SadrJ.Azam 11 and undertake the reorganization of his finances on the terms proposed by the Therefore consideTtion toman Bank, which would probably involve, as I have explained, the fall of should be limited to the Sadr-i-Azam. I will confine myself, therefore, to a consideration of what R|gie a debt m matter '° f we might effect by helping the Persian Government only in the matter of the Regie debt. I must preface the consideration of this question by stating that during the shah’s formal requests last few days the Shah, while pressing for help about the debt, has twice foradvice - formally asked me to obtain for him the advice of Her Majesty’s Government as to what reforms he should undertake, i( whether in the finances, or the army, or the administration of justice.” I would observe, to prevent mis conception, that I have not invited this request hy holding out any hopes that the Regie Loan would be paid off. On the contrary, I have steadily declined to admit that there was any likelihood of the matter being considered hy Her Majesty’s Government, and have declined even to promise that I would make any recommendation to that effect. I have pointed out that such a measure of pecuniary aid would be useless to save Persia from bankruptcy, and that it was unreasonable to expect aid from England wdien Persia was doing nothing to help herself. It is possible that this argument may have suggested to the Shah that a request for advice about reforms might be a good move, but the request w-as quite spontaneous and unconditional. Of course, too much importance must not be attached to it. The Shah, if he had once got his money, would always he able to find excuses for not acting upon any advice which he might have received, and, as I have told him, lie must know better than any one the causes of the present state of things. Nevertheless,! believe that both the Sadr-i-Azam and the Shah are at Probably actuated by this moment really impressed with the serious nature of the position into which p aliz ? t f n of '. senous tney nave dnlted, and that they might possibly be wullmg to do something m the way of reform if it did not involve too great a sacrifice. The Sadr-i-Azam tells me that the constant anxiety about money is becoming such a strain that he is getting quite worn out, and the Shah at his last interview with me spoke very strongly about it. It is just possible that the advice they receive may to some extent be followed. At all events, the Shah has deliberately asked for advice, and whether it is Opportunity for plain followed or not, I suppose it must be given. Wb have at least an opportunity s P eakin ?- for plain speaking, and even if much does not come of it the result can hardly be bad. I do not know whether it will be expected that I should make any suggestions as to the nature of the advice wdiich should be offered, but I shall perhaps be excused if I say a few words on the subject. With regard to the administration of justice, I would suggest that it would Administration of be undesirable to enter into details. Whatever is said may be twisted into an importancl^ pnmary attack upon the Mullas, who really administer what justice there is, and the matter is not one of the first importance. The Persians do not require an elaborate judicial system, and could not work one. With regard to the army, it is evident that the sound thing is to pay the Army, troops regularly, and attend to their well-being in other ways, so that they may Necessity for regular become a trustworthy force, upon which the Persian Government can depend payment of tioops. for the maintenance of order.

Such an arLgement would have its advantages but it would of course he much resented by the Eussians, even if the operations of our officers were confined to the south, and the Sha would fight shy of it because it would cost money. If we made him proi.i by it we could, I think, get him to agree. _ . f .1 With regard 'to the finances I would suggest a strong warning as to the results of practically forcing the Mint to issue excessive quantities of copper by exacting too high a payment for the Farm. Here we shall carry the Sadr-i-Azam with us to some extent, and if no great good comes of our advice, we shall at all events get the credit of having tried to stem the flood or “ black Perhaps also it might he desirable to suggest the loan of a trained English official to inquire into the financial system and report to the Persian Govern ment on the matters requiring reform. The Russians would view such an appointment with jealousy, and the official selected would have many difficulties to overcome; hut the Sadr-i-Azam might he disposed to accept the offer under certain conditions, and if we got a judicious man who would work quietly and not try to sweep too clean, we could in time, I think, do much good. The result of the offer might, however, he that the Persian Government would bring in some Frenchman or German. The abolition of the sale of Governorships, and the reform of the pernicious system of accounts described by Colonel Picot, should, I think, be pressed on the Shah. The latter piece of advice may perhaps give the Sadr-i-Azam an opening. I have said nothing about reforms in the Customs Department, which offers the most fruitful field for a large increase of revenue.* Every one is agreed that by the Customs Farm the Sadr-i-Azam will stand or fall, and it is, I think, to our interest at present that he should not fall. A warning to he less lavish in granting and continuing pensions would be desirable. Finally, though we could hardly go into the details of the Shah’s expen- dituie, he might, as he has asked tor advice, he reminded that care in this lespect is as important as anything. He could effect large savings in his Civil List if he chose to do so. In some ways he squanders money very reckessly. Both these warnings would he received with pleasure by the Sadr-i-Azam and the Shah might pay some attention to them. 27. It may perhaps he argued that if we are to give the Shah financial j P fl e should be made to pay attention to them, and generally to follow our advice. _ Of course it is true that if we give help we are entitled to expect that our advice will not be altogether disregarded. But I would not insist upon its being swallowed at a gulp. That would, I think, be a mistake. We must not expect too much, and the reforms suggested are very large. It would be better I think, to put upon the Persian Government the duty they are tiwino to pass off r t To * rf, § r th ? ’r 1 advi “ we caii &gt; ^ his tllis if he chose;15 watching'sf Russian proceedings. _ This is not a purely Persian question.

C ^ an ^ ^° r Legation, to ascertain as accurately as possible. The ^ Meshed Agency has hitherto been our principal centre of intelligence in this respect, and it does not seem to me that the arrangement has been altogether successful. I therefore asked Colonel Picot to go into this question also, with special reference to military considerations, and I submit a Memorandum by him on ihe subject. We must, I think, watch Russian proceedings from Russian territory, not from outside, if we are to know what is going on. I do Possible reduction not wish to travel outside my province, and will therefore say no more on this ^expenditure at point except that if Her Majesty’s Government should think it desirable to SeShme^f establish centres of information elsewhere it might be found possible to reduce ^er centres of to some extent the expenditure at Meshed and Resht. The Meshed Agency, ° Servat, ° n * however, is under the Government of India, and they may not agree in this opinion. 29. I have now submitted my views and proposals regarding the situation f umm . ar y°. f _ in this country. To recapitulate briefly, they are as follows proposals. ' Persia is misgoverned, and her condition is not satisfactory. Her finances are in disorder, her trade and resources undeveloped, and she contains some elements of disturbance, while there is no armed force upon which the Govern ment can depend for the maintenance of its authority. The influence of Russia, which is antagonistic to our own, predominates at Tehran, and it is believed to be exerted against the interests of the country. On the other hand, Persia has practically no debt, and her natural resources are great. Her internal condition is not hopeless, or such as to cause immediate alarm. And the influence of Russia, though predominant, is not exclusive. England has still a strong position throughout the country ; and Russia, recognizing her own weakness in Asia, seems unlikely for the present to take any step in Persia which would seriously offend us. The general situation, therefore, might be worse, but it is not one with which we can rest altogether satisfied. It is not probable that Russia will combine with England in reorganizing the Persian administration, and developing her trade: and there is little help to be got in this direction from other European nations, none of whom carry any weight at Tehran. England by herself, especially if thwarted by Russia, cannot hope to over come the opposition of interested persons in high places, and to carry a scheme of reform which shall regenerate Persia. She can hardly hope, indeed, to carry any reform of radical importance, and must fall back upon her existing policy, contenting herself with maintaining the integrity and independence of Persia; watching and checking Russian aggression; gaining the good-will, respect, and confidence of the Persian Government and people ; developing trade; and taking such opportunities as may occur of urging measures beneficial to the country. With the view of maintaining the integrity and independence of Persia, it is desirable to make timely arrangements for securing a quiet succession on the Shah’s death ; and we should endeavour to strengthen our influence over the Heir-Apparent by keeping an English doctor with him, by improving the position of our Representative at Tabriz, and in other ways. W e should also let it be understood that aggressive action by Russia in the north of Persia will immediately result in decided action by us in the south. In order to strengthen the friendly feelings entertained tow r ards us in many parts of the country, we should encourage picked officers to travel among the Chiefs and people, and we should, as occasion offers, establish fresh Agencies at important points. We should also try to obtain for the people such benefits as a good currency. The Persian Government should be made to understand that they must not trifle with us in the future, as they have occasionally done in the past; but we should try to gain their good-will, and to help them in any way we can. Just now there is an opportunity of putting them under a great^ ooligation by relieving them to some extent of the burden of the Regie debt, which they find very harassing.

In spite of all I have said to prevent false nopes, the Snah and Sadr-i-Azam entertain the most sanguine expectations from the result of the recent elections in England. They are excited and elated by it, feeling con vinced that England will now take a serious and benevolent interest in Persian affairs. They are also more disposed than usual to be impressed by what is said to them. The attitude of Her Majesty’s Government will be closely watched here, and any action taken now will, I believe, have a marked and lasting effect upon the future course of our relations with Persia.

I HAVE the honour to transmit^ for your information^ a series of papers embodying the result of an inquiry into Persian administration, and dealing with the question of interior reform. I have caiefully borne in mind the necessity of retaining, as far as that were possible, those forms of government to which the people are already accustomed, and have therefore brought forward proposals under the form of modification rather than radical change. Ihe difficulty really lies with the official classes, who are deeply interested in maintaining the existing state of affairs, and in very many cases opposed to financial reform. These papers will, I venture to hope, prove of some value, Part I presenting a fairly accurate picture of Persian official life, and Part II offering many suggestions for better government. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) H. PICOT, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military AitachS. Part I.— Notes on Persian Administration. No. 1. (Confidential.) For the purposes of administration the land area of Persia may be divided into Appointments of provinces, districts, ^belooks,” and villages under Governors-General, Governors, Governors in the Deputies, and Khedkhodas, or village Headmen. provinces. The Governors-General and the more important Governors purchase their appoint ments at Tehran, where they are offered for sale to the highest bidders. These again effect sales of the minor appointments, and so on down the whole length of the official ladder. The appointments are generally for one year. On the departure of the successful purchaser to the province, a Memorandum showing the revenue and expenditure for the year is placed in his hands, no mention, however, being made of the purchase-moneys. The revenue is derived from direct and indirect taxation. Revenue. The direct is that levied on land, forming the main portion of the revenue; the indirect that from the customs, road taxes ( a rah dari”), octroi, special guild taxes, and tribal taxes. This direct and indirect form of taxation is what is known as the f *'asl” or real revenue. The basis of the land revenue is the village. There are in Persia two sorts of Direct taxation, villages for purposes of taxation, viz., those owned by individual proprietors, and those owned by the peasants. In the first case the proprietor is alone responsible for the collection of the taxes; in the latter the Khedkhoda. The tax is estimated roughly on the cultivated land, on the water supply, on cattle, and heads. No regular system can be adduced, local circumstance, custom, and ancient right being among the many factors. Both cash and kind payments are made, the cash revenue being derived from such cultivation as vines, rice, and comprising also poll and cattle tax. The indirect taxation will be dealt with separately. indirect taxation. Under the head of expenditure are included army expenditure, buildings, repairs, Expenditure, remittances of taxation, salaries, and pensions. As already stated, the direct and indirect taxation form what is known as the “asU or Additional taxation, real revenue of the country, but in addition thereto is another tax called the “farh,” or additional. “ Farh ” may be termed an extra levy in cash, proportionate to the cash payments of the “ asl” revenue. It ranges from ^ to 5 or 6 krans on every toman of the “ asl” tax, and has gradually taken root as part of the system of taxation, though it forms no part of the revenue of the country at large.

The “ Daftr,” or Accounts Department, is the great accounting Department of the State. At its head is a Minister (“ Vazir-i-Daftr ”) nominated by the Shah, and assisted by a staff of a Mustauffis,” or Accountants. . r . r , • , , These Mustauffis are recruited from Irak, where certain families nave pio\idea Accountants for generations. They generally have a very elementary education, and undergo no special training. iw, i • j j • The duties of the Daftr concern the whole accounts of the kingdom, and comprise the preparation of the Ministerial ^Estimates, and of all branches of the public seivice, the comnilation of the Budget, the issue of Memorandums showing revenue and expenditure ; Military Accounts Branch. Method of audit in the “ Daftr.” compilati finally, the compilation and audit of all accounts. One or more Mustauffis are set aside for the accounts of each province, Ministry, or Department. These men carry out the duties already enumerated, centralization being the first and last word of the system. To suit the exigencies of army administration a separate Military Accounts Office has been created. This branch is nominally subordinate to the Daftr. The Military Accounts Branch prepares the estimates for each regiment and province for the information of the Daftr, and for insertion in the Budget. It also compiles estimates for the expenditure required in each Department of War, for buildings, arsenal, arms, &amp;c., and keeps the account of expenditure. At the end of the year accounts are submitted by each Governor, Minister, or Head of Department, and are taken in hand by the special Accountant of the Daftr already spoken of. The Memorandums serve as the basis of check, receipts as a rule serving as vouchers for expenditure. One important exception must be mentioned. For more important items of expenditure the receipts alone are not accepted; in their place a “ Barat ” or written order is required. This Barat is drawn up by the Mustauffi, and after receiving the signature of the Minister of the Daftr is sent on for the approval of the Sadr Azm and the seal of the Shah. This Barat system enables the Daftr and the Sadr Azm to pass in special review all heavy disbursements, and though the Memorandums may have authorized the expenditure, yet the Governor or Minister is held responsible until the Barat replaces the receipt. A great power is thus relegated to the Sadr Azm, who acts as a final referee. Very heavy sums are sometimes paid for bribes to the higher authorities for these Barats. The system of audit in the Military Accounts Branch differs but little from that in the The Barat system is also in vogue, the Naib-es-Sultaneh (Minister of War and son of the Shah) exercising great power in respect thereto. The accounts are finally centralized in the Daftr, but that Department interferes little with its sister branch owing to the personal influence of the Naih-cs-Sultaneh. The practical outcome of the system is to give the Daftr complete and irresponsible every branch of accounts, over the estimates, the expenditure, and~ the Q , Its Sta f f folI f s a P ow erful and interested corporation, and its work is submitted to no sci tiny.

Chiefs binding themselves to furnish a certain number of troops, cavalry or infantry, during times Only in the early part of the century, with the appearance of European officers, was the regular system introduced. 1 * The recruiting is based on the village system, each village being held to furnish its quota of recruits. I here is, however, no regularity in the system. In the first place, the rough calculations on which numbers are based were made long since, and have not been revised; and, besides, the present dynasty having come from the direction of Astrabad, lirst took the northern provinces, and thence drew their men and material for the subjugation of the rest of Persia. The people of the north, too, being of the same race as their conquerors, are considered the most loyal, and are therefore made to furnish the gieatei pait of the infantry. Azerbaijan and Irak are the chief recruiting-grounds. jlIic cavaliy aie chiefly drawn from Khorassan, where large numbers of Kurdish horsemen were originally established to check the inroads of the Turkomans. I he aitilleiy is at piesenu supplied on a voluntary system, Azerbaijan again providing most of this branch. ' 1 &amp; Service is for life, but in practice the men are continually exchanged. Out of a regiment 800 stiong, 180 to 200 men only probably live out their lives as soldiers, a money payment to the Commanding Officer sufficing to purchase discharge. I ne pay being almost the villages are often obliged to offer a bonus varying from 10 to 50 tomans to the recruit as an inducement to serve: further, an annual payment is made averaging from about 3 tomans. No regard is paid to age or capacity, any objection raised by the Commanding Officer being easily silenced by a money payment. The appointment of officers is made by nomination, and as a rule the Minister of War nominates up to the rank of Major. For higher grades a Firman from the Shah is required, countersigned b}’ the Minister of War. In all cases a money payment is required varying from 50 to 500 tomans ; sometimes more is paid. The number of officers is limited only in the regiments. There is no limit to the grant of honorary titles, the sale of which is a regular matter of traffic. Men on leave draw the equivalent of six months’ pay from the village or district. They are paid by the village authorities, who are allowed corresponding deductions in the village taxes. Actually the men receive but a small portion of their dues, the rest being eaten up by the Governors, Commanding Officers, tax-collectors, and the Minister. In garrison the men receive six months’ pay from the village, six months from the provincial revenue or the Treasury. The sums required for disbursements to the troops in the provinces are, as already stated (vide Part 1, Paper No. 1), included in the Governors’ Memorandums, and payments are effected accordingly. These expenditures are, as a rule, dealt with by the Accountants of the Military Accounts Branch, who are specially detached to the provinces for the purpose of obtaining receipts, checking expenditure, authenticating documents, &amp;c. The appointments are much sought after, 1,000 tomans being sometimes paid as purchase-money. The payment of troops in Tehran is effected by the Minister of War, who draws in a lump sum annually the moneys required for the troops and the various Supply Depart ments. The direct disbursements are made by the Military Accounts Branch of the Ministry. This system is of recent growth, and it is only within the last few years that the Government Treasury has ceased to deal directly with the troops and Supply Depart ments, The troops are paid invariably many months in arrears. The Military Accounts Branch loans out money at high rates of interest to native bankers, and to enable it to command the necessary capital the pay of the troops has to be utilized. Short payments are also invariably made, and as all the superior ranks demand a share in the profits,* from the Minister to the subaltern, the regiments are maintained far below their regulation strength. As a rule from 200 to 300 men are always short in every 800. A certain fixed sum is set aside annually in the Budget expenditure of the several War Departments, and is taken over by the Military Accounts Branch of the War Minister. Each and every one of the Departments which comprise the arsenal workshops, ammunition, equipment, harness, ordnance, clothing, and stores is under the immediate control of the Minister, and is exploited in his interests. No check can be exercised, for he not only orders the expenditure, but manufactures and takes over the supplies, and then finally carries out his own audit. To sum up, the whole machinery of the army is so administered as best to serve the private aims of the individual. The troops are left unpaid, ill-clothed, badly fed, discontented, and ill-disciplined. Disorder reigns in every branch of the Service; in truth, nothing is le ft undone which a wicked ingenuity can devise for spoiling as good material as a soldier could ever hope for.

The Sadr Azm in turn sells the right of collection of customs, including “rah dari” and octroi duties, along the several frontiers to the various provincial Governors or private individuals, the transaction being in the nature of a private contract, and, generally speaking, passing from hand to hand, and renewed annually. Whatever profits acciue ovei and above the specified sum paid annually into the Treasury (900,000 to 1,000,000 tomans) becomes the perquisite of the Sadr Azm, the same principle holding, one may say, throughout Persian administration and exactly parallel to the case of the Ministers of Posts and Telegraphs {vide Part I, Papers Nos. 9 and 10), who take as perquisite all revenue derived from their Administration, less a certain fixed sum paid into the Treasury. Note .—Reliable native sources give the profits of the Sadr Azm at 200,000 tomans per annum, i.e., 40,000/. As previously mentioned, the Customs form one of the chief sources of the revenue of Persia. Under this head are included taxes on imports and exports, “'rah dari” (read tax), and octroi. Two rates of customs duties are levied, the one on foreigners, the other on natives. The customs duties levied on foreigners have their basis in the terms of the Treaty of Turkmanchai (between Persia and Russia, of the 10th (22nd) February, 1828), the conditions of which briefly stated are as follows :— “Article III. Merchandize imported to or exported from Persia is subject to a •) per cent, duty at the time of entry or departure; and afterwards is not liable to any other customs rights,” 1 The customs duties levied on natives consist of the payment on imports and exports of anonmnd 3 percent, only (but this sum varies from year to year), and, in addition, the duties of ran dan' and octroi, the amounts for which constantly vary, depending in reality on the power of the contractor to extract money from the merchant; so that by the time from fo tc/lfpcfcenf lnt ° the c0 ™ tl ' y ' or OT '“ «&gt;» native merchant has had to pay By the Trealy of Turkmanchai Persia deprived herself of all flexibilitv in her fnveffin riTe / elat “W f0 , r tl ’ 0U ? b her c0ncliti0ns ° f eomme^e with Cssiakre recinro/d the,-are not so with other natrons; France, for instance, whilst claiming the riHrl nf ffi, most-favoured-nation clause, can imnort into Persia m n claiming the right of the Persia mhdit We tn t-,,. oh n \ \ e ! sm kr 0 P er cent, ad valorem, whereas “• = the terms of her Customs relations with other countries. f R for ^ improvement in a am, ,\ fixing the value of the customs at 900 000 or 1 000 ooo + it, a long period r eidly adherW fn ^ • f ‘^ J 'm,uuu oi i,U0U,000 tomans, and through flexibil tv.

I he Barat system {vide Part I, Paper No. 2) is much employed in the Treasury, for no extraordinary disbursements can be made except on the Barats vouched for by the Minister of the Daftr and the Sadr Azm. , The business of the Treasury is conducted very irregularly, and its funds are utilized Conduct of business. by the Minister and others concerned much in the same way as are those of the Military Accounts Branch by the Naib-es-Sultaneh, Minister of War. In many respects the Tleasury is treated as a private banking concern, relations being entered into with private bankers ( a sarafs and moneys loaned out at high rates of interest. To carry out this programme the Treasury seldom is able to disburse moneys on due date, and a very large number of Barats are kept out for eight or nine months even without receiving attention. The actual disbursing business is managed through these “ sarafs,” on whom the Minister issues cheques or pays orders in replacement of the original Government Barats. Great delays ensue, and the holders of the cheques, rather than run the risk of indefinite delay, often prefer to compound with the “ sarafs,” receiving from 1 to 3 krans in the toman (10 krans). Large profits thus accrue to the great advantage of the Minister and the bankers. At the end of the year the Treasury submits its accounts to the Daftr, where they Audit of accounts of are written up by the Mustaufifis set aside for the purpose. After verification they Treasury, receive the signature of the Minister of the Daftr and the Sadr Azm. A cursory glance at the foregoing will show that this branch of the public finances is General remarks on managed on the lines of a private monopoly. The fact that the Minister is own brother to the administration, the Sadr Azm gives him enormous power, and nullifies the audit which is supposed to be exercised by the Daftr. It also nullifies the value of the audit by the Minister of the Daftr and the Sadr Azm. The Treasury, as regards management, is the counterpart of the Military Accounts Branch. The one is conducted in the interest of the Prime Minister, the other in that of the Naib-es-Sultaneh, Minister of War, neither being under the effective control of the Daftr owing to the high positions occupied by the respective patrons of the subordinate Departments. I make special mention of this contrast, because I think it accounts in great part for the want of influence of the Sadr Azm in all matters affecting the army administration, the Minister of War always being able to reply to any criticism on the part of the Prime Minister by pointing his finger at the Treasury. I ought not to forget to. mention that the Amin-ul-Mulk finances all the private business of the Customs for his brother, the Sadr Azm. No. 6 .—Ministry of Pensions and Charitable Bequests. This so-called Ministry is presided over by a Minister known as the “Vazir-i- Organization and Vazaief,” through whose agency an annual expenditure of 500,000 tomans is said to be scope, effected. On the pensioned lists are found students of religious law, members of the priesthood, “Syeds,” and various Government servants.Charitable foundations® General remarks.

Of administration by higher authonty there Only in one foundation does Government directly interfere, the Holy Tomb at Meshed being the exception to the general rule. , . ,, „ The system, both as regards pensions and charitable foundations, presents many anomalies. Government receives little or no return for its large expenditure in pensions, and instead of by their means wielding an enormous influence over that troublesome class of people, the students and Moolahs, is more or less a slave in their hands. The moneys wasted on so-called theological training, if directed into proper educational channels, would serve not only to spread theological knowledge, hut to place the liberal sciences within reach of large numbers of students. The charitable foundations are either lying idle or dwindling through corruption. The Government shirks all responsibility, and prefers to leave the field open to exploita tion. The income accruing from the bequests would, under the most ordinary management, suffice to repair perhaps every caravanserai in the country, and to restore the colleges to a high state of prosperity. It is difficult to account for the apathy. No. 7. — The Ministry of Justice. The office of Minister of Justice has until quite lately been united to that of Com merce. The duties of the Minister of Justice theoretically consist of taking general note of the law throughout the country, of enforcing the execution of judgments delivered bythe Ulema according to the Religious Law, and of hearing all cases referred to him under the “ Urf,” or law of custom. As a matter of fact, the power of the Minister is quite a personal matter; at times his influence may extend far afield, at others hardly reaching beyond the walls of his own dwelling. A strong Minister will have his agents in every province and chief town to take note of the local course of justice; but it seldom happens that the chief is sufficiently influential to invest his agents with proper authority.

The first sign of weakness, however, on the part of the civil authorities, by thc mem *- 01 the Slightest relaxation of their control, at once adds to the influence of the Ulema, and with it comes an usurpation of the Urf laws by the religious authorities. No. 8 .—The Ministry of Commerce. As already stated, this Ministry till quite recently formed part of the Ministry of The Minwtrr Justice, presumably because the role of the Minister confined itself almost entirely to the judicial side of commercial business. Theoretically, the organization of the Ministry takes the same lines as that of Justice, Organization, the Minister relying on special agents to control or direct commercial justice in the provinces and chief towns. The position and functions of the agents depend entirely on the amount of support the Minister is able to extend. More often than not they are absolutely useless^and ignored by the civil authorities who usurp their powers. Competence in the case of ordinary law is dependent solely on the power of the Commercial business officials to give effect to their judgments, or to the decisions of special Committees of merchants to which complicated cases are referred. Commercial business is conducted according to the Urf laws, but advantage is always taken by the Ulema of any disorganization in the Urf Administration to intervene between merchant and merchant. Of late years their intervention on behalf of the native merchant has been temporarily such as to cripple foreign trade and to render the relations between the foreigner and the people almost impossible. The cases have, been numberless where they have been able to set aside the decisions of the civil authorities, and even the special orders of the Sadr Azm himself, to whom, in the absence of any responsible Minister, all final appeals are now made.

At the same time private individuals, merchants, &amp;c., employed foot runners for the conveyance of their own and other correspondence, which they undertook to deliver at a certain charge. Gradually the Government messengers were allowed to carry private letters without fixed charge, and later permission was given to travellers to make use of the Chappar horses, a privilege at first jealously guarded. On the return of His Majesty from the first journey to Europe in 1872, an Austrian Establishment of officer, named Roederer, was engaged to organize a regular postal service with the Emin-ed- Eur °pean system. Dowleh, at the head of the Administration as Minister. For the first two or three years the service was little used. It then gradually developed to a relative degree of activity, and now that the people have gained confidence is used as a means of transmitting large sums of money, valuables, &amp;c. Insurances are effected through Lloyd’s or other Company by telegraph. The Posts are administered on the usual principle, that is, more or less on the lines of Monopolization of a private monopoly, subsidized in this case by the Government. The Minister is not Posts, called upon to render an account of his trust, but is simply expected to maintain the Department at a certain degree of efficiency, and is at liberty to dispose of the profits as he may think fit. The subsidy is a relic of the old days, when the Government was in the habit of granting' a certain sum for the maintenance of establishments afid horses at the different Chappar services. These allowances have never been allowed to lapse, and form part of the stock in trade of the Ministry.

This sum actually reaches the Treasury, and suffers hut slight shrinkage en loute.. , . # The system of monopoly acts in a manner detrimental to progress and extension; the Minister, though one of the most enlightened of Persian officials, works the lines m his own interests; an enormous staff, especially in the subordinate ranks, is maintained at the expense of Government; projects for new lines are almost invariably obstructed by the Minister, who fears that extension might lead to further demands on his private purse; and, lastly, no check on the accounts can be maintained by Goverment, or any estimate made as to the working value of the Administration. No. 11.— The Foreign Ojfiee. The Foreign Office is presided over by the Kavam-ul-Mulk, an old gentleman in his dotage, who is privileged to figure in name as Chief of the Department. The actual Chief is the Prime Minister, the Sadr Azm, who, with his Frist Secretary, the Mushir- ul-Mulk, personally conducts the affairs of the Ministry. The staff consists of several Secretaries dealing with English, Russian, Turkish. Diplomatic business. Consular affairs, ceremonies of Court, records. As a rule all foreign Representatives communicate directly with the Sadr Azm. The Diplomatic and Consular Services form part of the Foreign Office, the Ambas sadors and Ministers receiving their nominations from the Shah, and retaining their appointments at the pleasure of His Majesty ; similarly, the more important Consuls obtain their nominations by Royal favour. Many of the appointments are of pecuniary value owing to the large returns derived from passports, the sale of patronage and justice, &amp;c. The posts of Constantinople and liffis are more especially sought after on this account. The Consulships abroad are usually given to bankers or others to whom the position may be a matter of consideration* and who pay accordingly. c?!

A considerable sum of money is annually budgeted for on account of its servants, but fixed pay is a figuie of speech, the influence of the individual being the one determining In the provinces the payment of the subordinates and of all those borne on the Payment of public Provincial Lasts is a matter which depends very much on the financial prosperity of the servants.

If his affairs are doing well, and the demands made by the Central Government have been within reason, the officials may be paid, if, on the contrary, the demands have been excessive, the salaries will either be withheld, paid in part, or not paid at all.

PICOT, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache. Tehran, August 31, 1895. Paet II .—Proposals for Reform of the Central Administration of Government. No. 1. (Confidential.) The papers on Persian administration, Part I, have entered into the question of Reform in administration in some detail, and have shown the evils resulting from too great a concen- administration, tration of power, the effacement of the individual Minister, the weakening of the central authorities, want of permanency in the administration of the provinces, disorganization and want of control over the finances, &amp;c. In this, the second part of my sketch, I propose dealing with the subject of reform and such other matters, financial or commercial, as may assist the country in re-establishing its finance and credit. In drawing up this scheme I have attempted to keep the following points continually Object aimed at in before me :— scheme of reform. 1. To retain the old forms whilst endeavouring to reconstruct; in other words, to avoid novelty. 2. To restore the central authority, and to extend its control and direction to every Department of the public service, whether in the provinces or the capital. 3. To re-establish the responsibility and individuality of the Ministers, as well as of other chief officers of the State. To extend their powers in the provinces.

To cone with these multifarious duties, and to prevent the Council being swamped with detail it would divide itself into Committees or Boards for the consideration of its law, finance, commerce, &amp;c. Each Board would have its own permanent establishment. The direction of the Council would extend to every Department of the btate, and its thoroughness would react on all sides, more particularly on that which is concerned with finance. * Nothino- new or novel has been propounded, though an effort has been made to revive an effete assembly, and to make it what it should he a body contioiling and directing e\ery branch of the public service. _ . Its numbers have been somewhat added to, in order to make it more representative, to give it the means of coping with its increased labours, and to enable it, by force of public opinion, to resist absorption at the hand of any one individual member of the State. Part of my scheme for the restoration of the central authority includes also, the revival of the Council of Ministers, hut as this can only spring from an awakening of the Ministers to a sense of responsibility, I may at once pass on to that question, and show how I would raise their status, both as Heads of Departments and as members of the Council. The following is a list of the principal Ministers as they 7 now exist in name:— The Prime Minister. The Minister of War. ,, „ Interior. ,, ,, Finance. „ ,, Justice. „ „ Commerce. „ ,, Foreign Affairs. „ „ Pensions, Charitable Institutions. ,, ,, Posts. „ „ Telegraphs. „ „ Industries, Fine Arts. „ „ Court.

On him, therefore, devolves the whole responsibility, administrative, financial, and executive. ^ £ S ^ ie . a . rm y acc ounts are theoretically centralized and audited in the IJaiti oi tne Finance Minister, but the officers of that Department dare not oppose the favourite son or the Shah, and on the principle of “Live and let live,” interfere as little as possible with the finances of the Naib-es-Sultaneh. The system is one of extreme centralization. I do not propose dealing with the intricate question of army administration further than is necessary to bring the financial and supply branches into a semblance of order, and to define the relative position of the Civil and Military Departments of War. It seems absolutely necessary to breakup the confused organization which now centres Proposals for better on the Minister of War. This can, perhaps, best be arrived at by relegating the duties of admmistratl0n - supply and finance to a, civilian War Minister; the duties purely military to a Commander- in-chief. The former would be directly responsible to the Council of State, and would be The Minister of War, assisted by various Directors-General, experts charged with the Supply Departments of his Directors-Generai War under the responsibility of the Minister. of Supply Depart- .A 1 inanciai ^ecictciry would deal with tho nccounts of the cirmy. This officcr^s duty Financial Secretary* would comprise the compilation of the Estimate for inclusion in the Budget of the Minister of Finance, the issues of all moneys to the Supply Departments, the administration of the Army Fay Department, the primary audit before submission to the Great Accounts Department, the Daftr for final scrutiny by the Board of Accounts of the Council. I cannot insist too strongly on the importance of a thorough check on the army expenditure. The accounts of the Financial Secretary would be first examined in his own cheeking office by accountants nominated by the Minister of War, and chosen from other than the Mustauffi class of the Daftr. They would then be passed on for rigid audit in the Daftr of the Minister of Finance (vide “Finance” or “Daftr,” Part II, Paper No. 4), and by him would be submitted to the Council of State for final scrutiny by their Board of Accounts. The military branch would he under the orders of the Commander-in-chief, who The Commander-m- would be responsible for the personnel of the ai’my, its drill and discipline. Being chief, directly responsible to the Council of State, and not to the Minister of War, he would act as a check on the latter, and would see that the army were not starved, either as regards establishment, war material, or pay. I would add much to the importance of this office!' by extending his duties to the provinces, and by bringing the whole army under one military control. At present the powers of the Minister of War in his capacity as Commander-in-chief are limited to a certain extent; for instance, the Zil-es-Sultan practically commanding che troops in his Governorship, the Vali Ahd commanding those in Azerbaijan, the Governor-General doing the same in Khorassan. Whether under the changed order suggested it would be advisable to retain the services of the Naib-es-Sultaneh is very doubtful. The increased power of the Commander- in-chief might act as a sop to his vanity, and induce him to remain in office, but under no circumstances should any son of the Shah be allowed to occupy a position directly dealing with finance. This should be reserved entirely for a civilian officer. The principle is the same as that on which I would bar any official occupying a position equalling or excelling that of the Naib-es-Sultaneh (the Sadr Azm, for example) -concerning himself directly and personally with any of the Finance Departments of the State. No. 3 .—Ministry of Interior. This very important Ministry is now merged with that of Finance, both being Present view of the conducted by the Sadr Azm, the de facto, though not nominal, Minister of these great Ministry, branches of the public service. In Part I, Papers Nos. 1 and 2, the questions affecting Interior and Finance, such as the sale of office, the appointment of Governors, the system of revenue, have been entered into, and though it can hardly be said that Interior and Finance require reorganization in anv more urgent degree than any other branches of the Service, yet the scope of their dealings has'such vital bearing on public interests that the urgency of reform is here even move apparent, and demands most careful attention. I have throughout the present papers urged the necessity of dividing responsibility. Proposals for better- and of making the different Ministers actual, not nominal, Chiefs of Departments. Secondly, administration, of introducing a practical and efficient control of the public finances. To carry out this programme, the duties of Interior and Finance must be separated, and the functions conducted independently one of the other. The nature of the office of the Sadr Azm is such that he might very properly fill the place of the Minister of Interior. The duties I would limit— 1. To the nomination of provincial Governors and Sub-Governors. 2. To the control of the provincial administration. 3. To the control of the police, safety of roads, and sanitary measures.28 A, regards item 1, the nomination of Governors I have referred more particularly to this in the article on provincial admm.strafaon.

As regards perma nency in system of finance in provinces. Proposal for perma nency of staff. No. 4.—Ministry of Finance. According to the present order of finance in Persia, the great accounting Department of the kingdom is the Daftr, a central organization composed chiefly of accountants called Mustauffis, by whom not only are the central accounts administered, hut also every account of any importance, whether it be provincial, Ministerial, or local. Held together by ties of birth and self-interest, they are able to manipulate the accounts with impunity. The system may be described as the outcome of a great swindling corporation with feelers extending to the furthermost limits. The Daftr treats the Ministerial and provincial Estimates which are drawn up by the Mustauffis nominated from the Daftr for the purpose. It then compiles the Budget, prepares the Memorandums of expenditure (vide Part I, Paper No. 2), issues or checks the special orders directing disbursements, finally centralizes and audits all accounts. In fact, from first to last, it controls every financial transaction of importance. Eeform should, I venture to think, seek— 1. To limit the field and influence of the Mustauffis. 2. To prevent their interference with the finances of the Ministers or provinces except in so far as their legitimate audit is concerned. 3: To establish a higher and more responsible agency for the final acceptance of the accounts of the kingdom, to which the Accounts Department of the Finance Minister would be subordinate. 4. To create more permanency in the system of finance in the provinces. 5. To centralize under the Finance Administration the Treasury, the Customs and Mint. The first step will be to separate the Ministries of Interior and Finance, for both cannot be controlled by one personage, and under no circumstances should 'the chief finance ° f ^ ^ ^ adr Azn b have an y direct dealings with this Ministry, i.e., with I would therefore make Finance into a distinct Ministry, under a capable and trusted official, noted for his integrity and courage. It goes without saying that he cannot he a member of the Mustaufii corporation. Now, as regards the Mustauffis, their proper field is in the Daftr of the Minister of Finance, and there alone should they be employed. Their duties would be concerned with the examination of the Ministerial FsHmatP* the compilation of the Budget, the preparation of the Memorandums of expenditure fvide Part I Paper No 2), and the audit of the Ministerial and other accounts P ( Ministry^wilTlmve^its ^wn^Teparate^Accounts^Offic 8 'bf “”*‘7 OT P™™ces, each '‘'l: '.SS*?'

As regards the Treasury, no personal interest should be allowed to stand in the way, Proro S .ls and 1 would insist on the Treasury taking its place as one of the Departments of the control ol Minister ot Imanee.

The expenditure Now tftVprorincTat duties: these can only be adequately carried out by means of nermanent agents! through whom alone can commercial business be controlled or a regular sv tern of commercial law and procedure be attained. A strong Minister even now, under the present system, has power to enforce his will in the provinces through h.s personal agents, but these suffer through the temporary nature of their appointments, being liable to removal whenever the Minister falls into disfavour. By making the agents members of the permanent staff of the Ministry, not of the Minister, this evil would, to a great extent, b6 regards the class of agents : these might be chosen from the commercial classes, and to them would be delegated the judicial functions of the Minister. _ They would settle all ordinary disputes, and for the more serious cases assemble Committees of influential personages to assist them in giving judgment. The Committees might be of a semi-permanent nature, and couid even become repre sentative by election. They would be presided over by the permanent agent. In the capital the Committee might be formed of merchants chosen for their know ledge of commercial business. ' In foreign disputes, i.e., between Persian and European, the existing procedure would remain in force. This consists in the assembly of Committees presided over by a Foreign Office agent, the hearing being watched by Representatives of the Governments concerned. In time, however, as the ordinary Commercial Tribunals inspired confidence, the probability is that foreign Powers would gladly submit to their jurisdiction, thereby rendering com mercial justice a matter of law instead of diplomacy. Now, as regards the execution of justice, the agents would concern themselves solely with the judicial side of the law, the executive function resting- solely with the civil authorities, i.e., with the Governor and the permanent staff of the Minister of Interior. The effect of permanency in the administration of commercial law would cause the registration of a mass of precedents, out of which a codification of the commercial law might be expected to grow. The hands of the Minister would be enormously strengthened by means of the agents. He would be brought into close communication with the classes, and statistics would be forthcoming on which to base his calculations. 1 he powers of the Moolahs, too, would be greatly reduced. . .

There is. no reason why the agents should not form part of the permanent staff of the Ministry m the same way that the Peshkar forms part of the permanent staff of the Minister of Finance, or the Farrash Bashi of the Minister of Interior. If the principle of permanency were once recognized, the groundwork of government would have been laid. . The permanent staff would carry out their duties at the chief centres, vhi st they would have sub-agents or honorary Magistrates to assist them in every part of the country. (The latter need not necessarily be paid, for many would serve as a matter of honour and prestige;. All ordinary cases would be tried by these agents; more serious cases would be referred to the decision of Committees composed of several Magistrates, presided over by one of the permanent agents. A separation of the judicial and executive functions would form part of this system. It would be the duty of the Governors and his permanent staff of Farrash-Bashis, Farrashes, &amp;c., to see that the orders of the judicial agents were properly executed. It is essential that the judgments or decrees of the agents should be given effect to by the civil authorities; the agents or Magistrates confining themselves entirely to the judicial side of the law. So far I have only spoken of the Urf law as administered civilly. There is also the Sharh, or Religious Law, to be considered. It has been stated in Part I, Paper No. 7? that the Ulema have the absolute right to judge certain cases which come under the jurisdiction of the Religious Law. Now such right can by no means be interfered with. The Ulema must remain sole arbiters in their own branch. Like the agents of the Urf law, however, they will be dependent on the civil authority for the execution of their judgments. I would remark that a systematic administration of the Urf Laws would do much to diminish the influence of the Moolahs, and so, in a very direct way, add to the influence of Government. A permanency of system such as suggested would establish lay justice on a firmer basis, whilst registration of cases by the permanent staff would in the course of time lead to a codification of the Urf laws. Special attention should be given to procedure and law in the capitals, for there would the system crystallize and the law assume finality. The sharp separation of the judicial from the executive function would also do much to purify justice. As regards finance, the Minister of Justice would, like all other Ministers, be responsible for the preparation of the Estimates and expenditure in his own Department, and the regular rendering of his accounts to the audit of the Finance Minister to the scrutiny of the Board of Accounts of the Council of State. No. 7 .—Provincial Administration. Having now dealt with the Central Departments, I come to the question of the provinces. Firstly, I must refer back to Part I, Paper No. 1, where a brief sketch was given of the method of government and the system of taxation and revenue, the evils resulting from the sale of appointments, the maladministration of the revenues, the manipulation of the accounts in the interests of the Governors and Mustauffis of the Daftr. In the preceding papers an endeavour has been made to show how many of these evils can be minimized ; how the Ministers, through the agency of a permanent staff, can be brought into closer union with the provinces, and what an enormous effect this will have on systematic administration ; how the accounts would assume a healthier tone through the restriction of the power of the Muslaufli class, and the introduction of a comprehensive control by the Minister of Finance in the first instance, by the Board of Accounts of the Council in the second. There remain now two chief questions as far as the provinces are concerned : one, the status of the Governors ; the other, the great question of the revenue. Hitherto the Governor has taken his position in the provinces as the private farmer of the estates of the King, not as his responsible Representative in the true meaning of the word. He has purchased his right to exploit the people, and the Central Government has always felt that it had no power to criticize his methods, or to interfere except in very exceptional and scandalous circumstances. The appointment of permanent agents to responsible positions, and the consequent, displacement of the Governors 5 own servants, at once alters the status of the Governor, Proposal for ths establishment of a permanent staff.

') stated that the “farh” sometimes exceeds three times the amount of the“asl”tax) Nov the unwritten law is that the “farh” should hear some relative proportion to the “ asl ” revenue, and I take it, if that law were stnctly enforced, it would be a matte, of indifference to the people whether the collection were made by Government or by others. That being so, I would lay it down as a principle that Government a one • ' r ;al with the question of revenue; also, that under no circumstances should a dividual be allowed any rights over the public revenues of the country. _ . of this programme are at hand m the provincial for the execution private m The means permanent staff. A few words as regards this agency. The permanent staff would consist of—• The Secretary to the Grovernnient nominated by the Minister of Intel ioi. The Farrash Bashi, by the same. The Peshkar, by the Minister of Finance. The Treasurers, by the Minister of Finance. The Commander of the local troops, by the Minister of War. The agents and Magistrates of justice, by the Minister of Justice. The agents of Posts, Telegraphs, and Charitable Institutions, by their respective Ministers. The Peshkar, Treasurers, Sub-Treasurers, &amp;c., would control the actual collection of the revenue, as also its expenditure, and the accounting for the same. Khedkhodas, as at present, would he employed as the agents for actual collection in the villages. As regards expenditure, each Minister would give authority to his agents for the provincial disbursements of his Department. The agents would issue orders for payment, which would he checked by the Peshkars from the Memorandums of the Finance Minister. After verification and counter-signature of the Governors the payments would be valid. The Peshkar would render his accounts regularly to the Minister of Finance for audit by the Daftr. The real difficulty might lie in the reassessment of the taxation of the “asl” and “ farh ” revenues. Before Government could take any action or alter in any way the existing procedure, it would be necessary to have accurate information of the actual amounts now paid by each community, and then, with due regard to local circumstance, custom, a hundred and one othei conditions, to fix the actual amounts to which the community were liable. This information could best be acquired by Special Committees nominated by the Interior and Finance, which would make the necessary inquiries on the 'snot, eir statistics and proposals would be considered by the Minister, and thoroughly dncussed m Council, final orders being issued after due deliberation. All subsidiary orders specifying the amounts time, and method of collection would he circulated in every district or village, and the people would at last know for what they were liable. } exactj'omT'e 5 '™? m^ 0rt Tkf, k' “I' .f° the peaSant ’. and see that additional i • , -f ' ' chain of lesponsibility commencin°' with the n a d,rect,y 10 the the proviLe “be cT* 5 / l 1 ”; f-™' 8 M ™ stCTS capital of would meet eonstanay S *,° t G ;™- The y questions of common interest as also to ^ppgtp 6 ?! 1 t ^ e members to discuss to success.

An explanation of this attitude may be found perhaps in the desire of the Sadr Azm not to excite the jealousy of His Majesty the Shah, who might resent too great an accumulation of power in the hands of any one individual. Under the system suggested there will be no necessity for this personal effacement, and the Prime Minister will have nothing to fear by assuming before the world his titles of office as Prime Minister, Minister of Interior, and Foreign Affairs. It will be noticed that the Prime Minister will have no immediate dealings with any of the great financial Departments of State, such as Finance (Daftr), Treasury, Customs, Mint, Pensions, Charitable Institutions, See. This abstention will give great weight to his voice in the State and Ministerial Councils, besides adding immensely to his prestige in the country. It will also afford him the necessary leisure for the proper administration of his own special duties. No. 9 .—Ministry of Posts. It has been explained in Part I, Paper No. 9, that the administration of the Posts is now conducted on the lines of a private enterprise subsidized by Government, and that, despite the insecurity of roads and want of confidence on the part of the public, the service has developed in a marked degree. This development has taken place without any corresponding benefit to the Treasury, the whole of the profits going into the private purse of the Minister. As there is every reason for believing the revenue from this source to be already of considerable value, and that a great extension of business would take place concurrently with the improvement in the administration of the provinces, it would appear advisable to bring the Ministry into accord with the various other revenue-producing sources of income; in other words, to make it one of the Departments of State administered in the interests of Government and the people. No. 10 .—Ministry of Telegraphs. The tenour of my remarks in the preceding paper on the Ministry of Posts applies also in great measure to the sister Department of Telegraphs. In one respect there is a difference, viz., that the Minister accounts annually for a sum of 19,000 tomans to the Imperial Treasury. Actually he creates expenses, so that Govern ment is debited with a like amount, and practically the income derived is nil. There is yet a fair field for telegraphic extension in Persia, and provincial reform would certainly react favourably on this as on other Departments of State. I would strongly urge the advisability of Government dealing directly with the Telegraphs, and of making the Minister a public servant instead of a private monopolist. No. 11 .—Ministry of Pensions and Charitable Bequests. The interests which are at stake on the above account are doubtless great, demanding the full attention of a competent Ministry ; at the same time reforms are not of such immediate importance as, for instance, in the Departments of Interior, Finance, or Justice. It would be politic to allow the reorganization of pensions, together with inquiry into the management of charitable bequests, to wait over till some progress had been made in other Departments. Following on the installation of the Ministry, the influence of the Minister should lie extended in the provinces by the agency of a permanent staff. The latter would, under instructions from the Minister, carry out the ordinary business connected with the Pension Department, and take note of the due fulfilment of each and every bequest to which the country is heir. They would settle all simple disputes, and refer the more serious either to superior Committees, the Minister, or the Council of State. Before the agents, however, could take up the ordinary routine of duty the Ministei would be obliged to have recourse to special Committees. These would visit the provinces and review the pensions and charitable bequests in detail as well as in general. The reports would be studied by the Minister, discussed by the Council of Ministers, and finally threshed out by the Council of State. The agents would then be placed in possession of registration lists, be given details of pensions or bequests. The legal trustee would, as before, carry out the conditions of the bequests, the agent having the right to interfere as soon as mismanagement became apparent. What the final effect of a business direction of this Department would be can best be [668] ' K Proposal for the abolition of the mono* poly, and creation of Posts as a State Department.

Then the mother of the present Shah sent the four sons of the deceased captive slave to Tabriz to her son, the Heir-Apparent, with whom they remained until all of them returned with him to Tehran at the time of his accession. 1 ney all held confidential private service at the Palace. Aga Ibrahim, the third son of Zal Beg, held the office of an Abdar, and by degrees rose to be Abdar Bashi. _ . . „ , . Aga Ibrahim was naturally a clover inan^ but without a suspicion ot eoucation. He could not read or write his own name, which gave him more credit with his august Master. He was very pool’, married an Ispahani woman, who was his second wife, of whom he got six sons and tw r o or three daughters, viz., Ali Asghar Khan, Sadre Azam; Ismail Khan, Amin-ul-Mulk; Kassim Khan, Sahib Jama; Hassan Khan; Mohamad Khan; and one other. Aga Ibrahim, when Abdar Bashi, had a very small house in the town, and was perfectly contented with his lot. His eldest son, Ali Asghar Khan, was his favourite, and took a great care in his education. Ali Asghar Khan, the present Sadre Azam, was a good-looking and naturally talented boy, and proved well in the Persian and Arabic education he used to receive. At the age of about from 16 to 20 he was an accomplished Persian and Arabic scholar; then his attention was turned to romance and poetry. His poems are some very good, which displays his belief in Saufism; he has natural liberal ideas. His own hearty wish at the beginning of his age had been to be free from the political world, and to continue in his romantic thoughts and to lead the life of a Dervish, much against his father’s idea and will. He has had a great struggle with his father on the subject, but had, eventually, to bend to the wish and will of his father, which is one of the first duties of the religion. He then entered the service of the Shah as Sahib Jama, Chief of the Shah’s Transport. In that capacity, with the aid of his father, he proved himself very useful to the Shah, also won the good-wili of the people in general by his becoming demeanour and his generosity. In 1883, when the Shah visited the Shrine of Mashad, Aga Ibrahim, Amin-us-Sultan who at that time had risen to a most important position, died. The offices which were held by the deceased, together the title of Amin-us-Sultan, were given to the present Sadre Azam, which duties he performed to the utmost satisfaction of the Shah. In 1884, finding by long experience that his august Master was entirely humiliated by the dictations of Russia m Persian politics, he, for the first time, with the consent of the ^:' ah ’ f f °T ed R an • lntlI ?j! :e . fnendslll P Wlt fi «fie British Legation and began an opposition against the Russian Minister, and with the aid and the advices of Sir A.

He had not touched wine until he went to Europe, but since he enjoys it. He is for&lt;nving, but if once a man plays unfair with him, although he forgives, yet he does not have such confidence m him that he had before. He is rather vain, fond of society, patriotic. His success and the copious favours he has received and receives from the Shah nave caused a great jealousy by his. fellow-Ministers against him, and this immediately after the Shah s return from Europe in 1889, when he was greatly working in the interests it r , . n § llsh eilte rpnse, viz.. Concession for the road to Shushter, Regie, mining, &amp;c., all of which were against the Russian political interests. ^ His enemies, viz., Amin-u-Dowleh, late Mushire-u-Dowleh, Naib-us-Saltaneh, Zil-us- sultan, Sahibi Dewan, Azud-ul-Mulk, Kavam-ud-Dowleh, and nearly all the attendants of the -Palace were working against him, intriguing at the same time with the Russian Minister and M. Spyrs to bring troubles on him. . most unpopular English institution of all was the Regie, against which, with the intrigues of the iTaibuis-Saltaneh, M. Biitzow made a protest in 1890 before that enterprise was inaugurated. Sadre Azam, with the counsel of this Legation, fought the Russian Minister and proved to him that the Persian Government were not bound by the Treaty not to grant a monopoly to any one they liked. Ihe conduct of the manager of the Regie, in spite of the Sadre Azam’s continual advice for the quiet working enterprise, roused first the interested merchants in this trade and then the people against the Regie, which gave the Russian Minister here and his Consul-General at Tabriz, as well as the enemies of Sadre Azam, the most favourable opportunity and instrument, one to thwart British interest and destroy their opponent, and the other (Sadre Azam’s enemies) to ruin him completely. So they began to work against the Regie, which they reckoned would naturally ruin the Sadre Azam. In this scheme both the enemies of Sadre Azam and the Russians succeeded in the abolition of this enterprise; and no doubt, if not entirely ruined His Highness, still his influence with the Shah and his popularity with the people were much impaired, nor in such a momentous time, according to his own confidential conversation with Mr. Greene and myself, he received any practical help from our Legation, for whose interest, he grieved to say, had worked. Erom that time, and by other incidents which happened since, Sadre Azam’s real influence with the Shah began to fade, and His Majesty, through the constant intrigues of the Naib-us-Saltaneh and Zil-us-Sultan and others, is impressed with a conviction that Sadre Azam has been the cause of getting him into debt to the English Company. The Russian Minister, having succeeded in his scheme and having got the better over his opponent, thought it advisable to win the one man’s friendship whom he preferred to the others, nevertheless, they were his colleagues in the scheme. The opportunity afforded him in 1892, when Sadre Azam fell out with the Shah and sent in his resignation, which His Majesty did not accept. Then the Russian Minister came in and showed his friendship and help. He had an audience with the Shah and advised His Majesty to reconcile Sadre Azam, as no other Minister could do any good for him except Amin-us-Sultan, &amp;c. The reconciliation w 7 as made and His Highness was in that year raised to the position of Sadre Azam. The Russian Minister took the credit to himself, and took a good care also to make it known to all the world that he was the cause of reinstating the Sadre Azam. From that time Sadre Azam, discouraged by abolition of the Regie and other English enterprises which were, through his assistance, introduced, and by the callous indifference of his Master in bettering the state of his country, he has become comparatively careless in the affairs of the country in general, and submits to the wishes of the Shah with forbearing disgust. Now and then his patience gives way and attempts to resign and quarrels with the Shah, but those round him, such as his relations and his proteges, force him to be reconciled. His friends, that is real friends, are few, I may say none than his wife and family, but those who now profess to be his loyal friends are Amin Khelvat, Ikbal-u-Dowleh, Mushire-ul-Mulk, and a few more in the same standing, but these men to begin with are not influential enough, nor, I think, if Sadre Azam came to grief would stand by him. Vali Ahd professes a great friendship for Sadre Azam, but we know what sort of weak: creature he is, wdiose assistance, as long as the Shah lives, is of no avail to his Highness the Sadre Azam, and in the event of the Shah’s death he may be influenced by those around him against Sadre Azam. I have heard repeatedly from Sadre Azam in our confidential conversation, saying that he rather would be a peasant in Europe than in his present situation here, in which position he cannot do any good for his country under this present Shah, who, he said, has not a particle of patriotism in him, and thinks nothing for the country, but a greed for money and women. Nor, he said, it is any use trying to make him do anything. He was telling: me these words with most painful feelings. 8 (Signed) NAWAB. September 22, 1895.38 APPENDIX 4.

We have, in other words, essayed to cure an internal disorder by the application of external remedies. We should have directed our effort at the administration itself, for maladministration is at the root of all the evil from which Persia now suffers, and I am convinced that no good can come except following on a reorganization of the system of government. What that system is I have attempted to make clear in Part I of my notes on (&lt; Administration.” In Part IT, always adhering to the principle that the salvation of Persia depends primarily on internal reform, I have traced out the broad lines on which that reform might take its course. The next question is by what means or persuasion can Persia be induced to act energetically on her own behalf. Experience has proved both the inability and un-willing ness of the official classes to carry out any measures of reform, and has demonstrated that foreign pressure alone can supply the necessary motive power towards progress. Hitherto jealousy, commercial or political, has always prevented‘England and Russia from exercising joint pressure ; whatever the cause of jealousy, its effects, as far as Enffiand is concerned, cannot be deemed satisfactory. We have only partially succeeded in our trading purposes, Persia remains weak, and Russia advances steadily in influence and authority ; added to this non-success, the struggle has engendered a bitter feelino- between ourselves and our rivals. D With these resultants I venture to think some doubt may be expressed of the value of the hne of policy adopted m the past. In my opinion nothing short of war can prevent die spread of Russian influence m Northern Persia.

The Sadr Azm is piobably also interested in retainincr a Persian monopoly above Ahwaz, for rumour declares that he has a financial interest in the JNasin Company ; m any case, neither the weak fears of the Shah, nor Court intrigue, should be allowed to stand m the way. S 1 UUiU I attach much importance to the opening out of the Karun, not that British trade is iikeiy to develop by leaps and bounds, but because, till in direct touch with Shuster and JJizful, we shall never be able to compel Persia to open up the roads radiating therefrom, or to insist on the tribes being kept in order. The second guarantee is one that should safeguard our interests against such action as was taken by Russia a few years ago, when she obtained a concession giving her the power to block all railway construction in Persia till the vear 1900. This concession struck directly at British development in the south, and showed how regardless Persia can be on occasion of the interests of Great Britain. (Signed) H.

During the war scare of 1885 about the only information we had regarding the move ments of Russian troops into Trans-Caspia was from the telegrams and reports of Mr. Peacock, the Consul at Batoum. Since then the Consulate-General at Meshed has been established, and a watch is kept on the various cantonments of Trans-Caspia as far north as Samarkand. As a rule our reports record the movements of Russian troops only after their arrival in Trans-Caspia. This is not sufficient; what we require is early and accurate information of activity in the Caucasus, in Baku, Petrovsk, or Astrakan. We may, I think, take it for granted that Russia will foresee coming events, and gradually prepare for the struggle by timely concentrations. Long before the outbreak of hostilities her troops will be quietly moving towards Trans-Caspia and Khorassan by way of the Caucasus, and to the Oxus by Orenbourgh and Siberia; whilst both Astrakan and Tashkend will be pouring in supplies by the Trans-Caspia Railway system. It is at this time early information will be of the utmost importance. Our only source at present is Mr. Stevens, the Consul at Batoum, and his powers are limited to watching the arrivals and departures of Russian troops at Batoum from Odessa. He has no funds, neither has he any special organization for recording the movements of troops across the Caspian. Some years ago we had a Consul at Tiflis, but the appointment was allowed to drop with the departure of Mr. Lyall. The re-establishment of this post does not appear to be a matter of great moment, more especially as such a measure might lead Russia to demand similar concessions in India. On the Caspian itself we have no Consular officer. The Consul at Resht, in Persia, is some 20 miles inland from the port of Enzileh, and is entirely removed from all chances of getting news of any movements that may be going on in Russian ports to the north. His value for such purposes is practically nil.

PICOT, Lieutenant-Colonel, ( ° ; Military AttacM. Tehran, July 1, 1895. Consulates in Northern Persia: Tabriz. (Gonfidential)^ ^ two years? dating from t h e arrival of Her Majesty’s Consul-General in Tabriz in 1893, much correspondence has taken place on the subject of Her Majesty s Consulate-General. , ,. , e i . , c Mr. Y/ood pointed out that the means placed at his disposal for the maintenance ot the dignity of his position and the prestige of the British Government were such as could not bear 'comparison with those of his foreign colleagues, consequently the Consulate occupied a very secondary and humiliating position. Mr. Y r ood went to some trouble to prove his statements, and compared the relative positions of the various Consulates in so far as their emoluments and staff are concerned. Extracts from his letters of the 26th November, 1894, and the comparative statement, are attached.* It will he seen that Her Majesty’s Consul-General receives a salary of 650/. per annum, with 270 /. for office allowances, and is provided with an unfurnished house, at one time Her Majesty’s Legation in Persia. The Russian Consul-General receives a salary of 2,000/. per annum, has a furnished town and country house, six horses, and carriages provided by Government, besides many public servants, and is, in addition, assisted by a large staff consisting of two Secretaries, two Mirzas, two clerks. The Secretaries are paid for at the rate of 880 gold imperials, the Mirzas 100/. per annum. All are provided with quarters. The French Consul receives 800/. per annum, 400/. allowances. He is assisted by a Vice-Consul on a salary of 228/., and a Mirza paid at the rate of 23 tomans per mensem. All have free quarters. The Turkish Consul-General draws about 1,020/. per annum, is assisted by a paid Vice-Consul and Attache. All with free quarters. An examination of the foregoing shows that the staff maintained by Russia is much larger than that of the other Powers. Russian interests are doubtless greater, and her expenditure 's in proportion; her case, therefore, as regards expenditure, does not appear to offer a fair field for comparison. As regards the other Consulates the position is otherwise, and there should he at least no great disparity between the means and advantages allotted to Her Majesty’s Consul- General and those enjoyed by his Turkish and French colleagues. Mr. Wood, however maintains that a great disparity does exist, and that his means are such as do not admit of his performing his duties, social and political, in a manner befitting the Representative of Government. The details already given explain that Her Majesty’s Consul-General receives 650/. per annum as against 1,200/. of the French Consul, and 1,020/. of the Turkish Consul-General, or a difference of 550/. and 370/. respectively.

Mp^Zv? 11 ° n this ? ide ° f the Cas P ian Pty from Ozanada to Bander Gez and Mesned-i-bar. They proceed no further west, the consequence being that Astrabad has become an outpost of Tehran, not of Resht, and all reports are sent direct to Her Majesty s Minister at Tehran. Once every two or three years the Consul makes a tour to Astrabad, and renews his acquaintance with the province. The next port, and the more important, is that of Meshed-i-Sar, the outlet for xSarfurush and Mazanderan. _ Here again Russia does a large export and import trade. Kesht, as already explained, is a town lying 20 miles inland from the port of Enzileh. Ine trade is almost entirely with Russia. English merchants compete on a small scale in difficult C aSS6S co ^ on g 0 °ds, a competition becoming every year more and more ^jtish enterprise is further represented by a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, established to facilitate exchange operations. This business has so far not been very lucrative. J It is possible that a second branch may be opened at Meshed-i-Sar, as the manager has an idea of profiting by the large exchange, and of engaging directly in the trade with Russian houses; however, this is entirely problematical. Commercially, therefore, it would appear that our Consul has but little chance of pushing British trade. Politically, his influence is still more questionable. At one time Astrabad was thought politically to be a place of importance, owing to its proximity to the countries of the Yamut and Tekke Turkomans. This led to tbe Consular appointments of Captain Lovett and Colonel Stewart; but whatever importance the place may have had in the past, such has entirely ceased with the Russian occupation of the Trans-Caspian regions, and this was so far recognized as to lead to the abolition of the Consulate some years ago. Resht is even less favourably situated, and the presumption that the Consul can be of any political value may be dismissed as incorrect. There may be other reasons, of which I am in ignorance, necessitating the main tenance of an officer of the rank of British Consul at Resht; but, as regards our commercial interests, I am of opinion that equally good and sufficient service could be performed by a Vice-Consul.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship’s despatches Nos. 61 of the 27th June and No. 8, Consular, of the 29th September, 1898, calling for my opinion with regard to certain suggestions for the appointment of additional Consular officers in Persia. The matter has engaged my attention for several years, and I have more than once expressed my opinion upon it. In September 1895 I wrote a Memorandum reviewing the state of affairs in Persia, and submitting proposals for the improvement of our position. An officer had shortly before been sent to act as Consul in Kerman, and I wrote with reference to this appointment: “ It will strengthen our influence materially if we have more men of this kind in other parts of Persia as occasion offers, and if our Representatives in Bushire and Ispahan and Khorassan are encouraged to travel and make friends among the Chiefs and tribesmen. We need not excite the ready alarm of the Russians by too frequent journeys along their border, hut I think we should spend some money in encouraging travel elsewhere, and in establishing Agencies at important points. Eor instance, I feel very doubtful whether the Government of India are right in deprecating the establishment of a British officer in Seistan; and, under certain conditions, we might find it very useful to have a man in Shuster to help in the opening of the roads in the Lur and Bakhtiari country.” _ . . I also advocated an improvement in the position ot the Consul-General m T?£ll3I*00 Z In August 1896 I submitted a detailed proposal for the establishment of a Consulate at Shuster, on the Karun, where our traders had been brutally ill-used, and I suggested that for their protection and the maintenance of order we might raise a tribal levy under British officers. ;1 n ,. ,, A year later, when in England, I followed up these suggestions by advocating the retention of the Kerman appointment, and again asking for the establishment of a Consul on the Karun. ; . , . . ... . The result was that the Kerman appointment was continued, provisionally, and since that time the nomination by the Russians of a Consul for beistan has led to our also appointing a Consul for that district; but I believe no further steps have been taken to carry out my suggestions. Those suggestions formed part of a general scheme of policy, based upon an examination of the state of affairs in Persia in 1895. The further suggestions which I now desire to submit must, I think, in like manner, form part of a general sc erne of policy, based upon an examination of the state of affairs m Persia at the present time. The question of our Consular establishments cannot be consideied apart from ^ ^fmkuhe^Aole of the Memorandum of 1895 applies to the present position^ and the paper contains a general statement of the views which I held then, and hold stiU regarding the manner in which we should deal with Persia, I would therefore ask that the Memorandum may be read, and that this despatch may be considered as a supplement bringing it up to date. I can then confine myself to pointing out thechanges which have taken place since the Memorandum was written, supplying at the same time such further information as may be necessary to give a comprehensive view of the present state of affairs. . _ ^ /r .t, i . For convenience sake, though I trust the whole Memorandum will be considered, I will here quote the penultimate paragraph, which sums up my views and proposals. It ran as follows:— , tt -c “ Persia is misgoverned, and her condition is not satisfactory. Her finances are in disorder, and her resources undeveloped, and she contains some elements of disturbance, while there is no armed force upon which the Government can depend for the maintenance of its authority. The influence of Russia, which is antagonistic to our own, predominates at Tehran, and it is believed to he exerted against the interests of the country. “ On the other hand, Persia has practically no debt, and her natural resources are great. Her internal condition is not hopeless, or such as to cause immediate alarm. And the influence of Russia, though predominant, is not exclusive. England has still a strong position throughout the country ; and Russia, recognizing her own weakness in Asia, seems unlikely for the present to take any step in Persia which would seriously offend us. “ The general situation, therefore, might be worse, but it is not one with which we can rest altogether satisfied. “ It is not probable that Russia will combine with England in reorganizing the Persian Administration, and in developing her trade; and there is little hope to be got in this direction from other European nations, none of whom carry any weMit in Tehran. “England by herself, especially if thwarted by Russia, cannot hope to overcome the opposition of interested persons in high places/and to carry a scheme of reform which will regenerate Persia. She can hardly hope, indeed, to carrv any reform of radical importance, and must fall back upon her existing policv, contenting herself with mamtaming the integrity of Persia ; watching and checking Russian aggression • gaming the goodwill, respect, and confidence of the Persian Government and neonle • developing trade; and taking such opportunities as may occur of urging measures beneficial to the country. 0 0 measures rWrlnf 1 ? 1 a T ie ^. t0 maintaining the integrity and independence of Persia it is desnable to make timely arrangements for securing a quiet succession on the ShaV« death, and we should endeavour to strengthen our influence o^^ 8 ;rss asar* % zs’st&amp;STc!, 7 byRusm in the north of Persia will immediately result in dedded action by us ifthe parts'of 11 the^count^Tv^sliould'eiieourac^ ® ntertailled towards us in many and people, and we' should as o C “ s k,n offers!?

The old Shah, Nasr-ed-Din, who had then ruled for nearly fifty years, is now dead. He has been succeeded by his second son, Mozaffer-ed-Din, who has proved an amiable but very weak Euler. The Sadr-i-Azam, or Prime Minister, all powerful in 1895, was overthrown in the following year. He has now returned to office, but with a shadow of his former power. All real power is at present in the hands of the Shah’s irresponsible advisers, notably his doctor, the Hakim-ul-Mulk. There is practically no Government. Some of the troops have disbanded themselves, and the rest are unpaid. The pay of the civil establishments is also in serious arrears. The finances, which were in disorder in 1895, are in worse disorder now. The Sadr-i-Azam has borrowed 300.000/. from the Eassian Bank in Tehran, but all attempts at raising a substantial loan have broken down. The revenues, except from customs, are coming in very slowly ; and at this moment the one hope of getting any considerable sum of money lies in the sale of the Provincial Governorships to the highest bidder. This destructive system, abolished by the new Shah when he came to the throne, has been revived by the Sadr-i-Azam ; and it is said that this year’s auction is to he on a very large scale indeed. There is much murmuring throughout the country at the state of things in Tehran, and the discontent is increased by the high price of food, which has led here and there to some serious rioting. Altogether, the internal condition of Persia is very unsatisfactory. The Eussians, meanwhile, have not been inactive. To the north, the road from Enzeli to Tehran, which had made but little progress before the visit of General Kouropatkine to Persia in 1895, has, since then, been vigorously pushed on, and it is now nearly ready for wheel traffic throughout its length. This is a most important advantage to Eussia, both from a commercial and from a military point of view. Even now two-thirds of the imported goods sold in Tehran are Eussian. In the north west, Eussia has pushed forward her railway towards Tvars, and has surveyed a line from Kars to the Tabreez frontier, while within Azerbaijan there has been a remark able propaganda among the Nestorian Christians, some thousands of whom have been won over to the Orthodox Church, thereby obtaining Eussian protection and opening the door to Eussian interference. To the north-east, the Eussians have constructed a good cart-road from Asteanbad to the Meshed frontier, and, by energetically encouraging their trade in Khorassan, they have secured a commanding position in this valuable market. They have also made use of the outbreak of plague in India to push down u sanitary ” posts along the Afghan border in the direction of Seistan, where also they are trying to introduce their trade, and where they are shortly to ha\e a Consul. Even in the centre of Persia, as far south as Ispahan, the Eussians have shown fresh activity by establishing there a Consulate on a considerable scale of expenditure, and our Consul reports that the sale of Eussian goods has already begun to increase, I will not go into detail here, or enumerate the persistent rumours which reach me as to Eussian schemes in various directions; but it Is, I think, quite c ear, from the facts I have mentioned, that the Eussians have been working consistently, and not without effect, to push their trade and to enhance their political innuence m It is only natural that their operations and the unsatisfactory state of internal affairs should‘have had a depressing effect upon British trade. M e are being rapidjy ousted from the Khorassan market, In Tehran itself our trade is undoubtedly suffering, and will suffer more as the Eesht road is opened to traffic. In the nmt west our Trebizond trade has fallen off to a serious extent. Even in the Gull ports, where, bv the way, there has been some attempt at Belgian and German compe t , wear^ not doing as well as we might be. The shrinkmg o our ^orassan trade has told here, and the most recent Eeturns cannot, I think, be regarde satisfactory. o^e r it must not be su pp 0? ed that recent changes m Persia have all been unfavourable to our interests. This is not the case. n on ffi , reason to be very well satisfied. Three years ago almost every ' n ,^ e i C0 ^ al t f ^ Persian or European, believed that the death of the Bhah would ^ general disorder and for some marked advance on the part ot R^sm, po ? the break-up of the country. I stated m my Memorandum • J k d H doubting the correctness of this view, but it was He been Majesty’s Government to make timely preparations, -this danger, averted.4 When His Majesty sSols toouble^n'ove^Persia, monev^h^outbreak*did r ^ot n teke^place) immediate advance; hut, thanks to E “^ah should die as suddenly as his and the succession was peaceful, it the piesenx miau* over nuietlv wp mav reasonably hope that the succession may again pass ovei quietly. This^is no doubt^^^egative gain, but, from our point of view it is very important. The Shah? too, though weak, is well-meaning, ^ and no , I tlnnk, at all inclined to submit to Russian dictation. He has retained Ins English doctor m spite of detei mined attacks on the part of the Russian and Erench Legations, who wanted to put m a Frenchman; and he has nominated as his heir apparent his eldest .son, who was opposed by the Russians; and his most influential adviser, the Hakim-ul-Mulk, is believed to be very friendly to us. „ i ^ j To turn to other matters mentioned in my Memorandum oi lo Jo, and connected points, we have defined the long disputed boundary between Persia and Kelat, and have pushed forward from India along the trade route to Seistan, and have sent officers into Seistan itself, and have made arrangements for the improvement of the trade route from Ahwaz to Ispahan. We have severely punished a tribe on the Gulf coast which was responsible for the murder of one of our telegraph officers, and we have sent a detachment of British Indian troops to protect the telegraph line for the future. This has had a good effect. Disturbances have occurred in Kelat territory, but they have not spread to Persian Beluchistan, and the Ruler of this important province has throughout behaved in the most friendly manner. On the Karun, at Shuster, our people have suffered seriously from the fanaticism of the town mob, which has been fostered, if not created, by the weakness of the Persian Government; but we are on good terms with the Arabs and Bakhtiaris who hold the neighbouring country, and a little decided action on the part of the Persian Government would soon put matters right in Shuster itself, where the people were at one time particularly friendly to us. In the south we have greatly strengthened our position, by insisting upon, and obtaining, the removal of an obnoxious Governor of Bushire. I dwelt in my Memorandum of 1895 upon the importance of the principle involved, and 1 would invite special attention to the point. The effect of the case has been most remarkable. Altogether, it is certain, from the reports of officers who have had recent opportunities of judging, that in the southern zone our reputation just now stands very high indeed. In lehian itself we have had to deal, and still have to deal, with some hostility or obstructiveness on the part of influential officials, but among them also our action in the south has had its effect, and recent events in the Soudan have created a oreat impression here. I do not think our political influence at the capital is any weaker it kstoontef 1 tlm0 la ‘ e Shah ' ° n the contrar y&gt; 1 tMllk ^at at this moment Perhws^aslhifmlftef “T SOm * encoura S in S features in the prospect, remaps, as this mattei is one of very great importance, and as it is esneomllv sornTdetaih qUeStl ° n ° f ° U1 ' Consular establishments, I had better examine it in ImpOTiaf JBankPCTslafwitlfa'capitalof^CSOWw/ 11 : 'YP ^ Bank ’ tlle Meshed Ispahan, Shiraz, Yezd, and Bushire.

Of the other routes, that by Trebizond still brings in a considerable volume of British trade, hut less than half it once brought in. The estimated yearly value of this trade is now about 302,000/. Curzon’s estimate for 1889 was about 610,000Z. It should he observed, however, that, although the decrease is doubtless due in part to Russian competition, it is also due in part to the Armenian massacres and the troubled state of the country during the last few years. There was a dreadful massacre in Trebizond itself, which shook the confidence of our traders. Trade checked in this way is likely to he diverted through other channels rather than lost, and I believe this is what has happened. Part of our Trebizond trade has now passed over to the more southerly routes, especially that by Bagdad. The trade by the Bagdad route has increased in importance, and seems likely to increase still further, especially if the railway system spreads in Asia Minor and Turkish Arabia. In the absence of any English competition, the Gbermans have unfortunately obtained a Concession for making the road from Tehran to Khanikin; and British trade in this quarter is threatened by the Russian road from Resht to Kazvin, which, under the terms of the Concession, may be prolonged to Hamadan. Still, at present, the bulk of the goods imported by this route are British, and we hold the Kerman shah and Hamadan markets to the exclusion of all European competitors. Erom there we push forward into Kurdistan and other districts, including Tehran and Ispahan. Our trade for last year was estimated by the bank agent in the Custom house at a total of 1,048,155/., of which 838,524/. is British; and the exports are said to have been exceptionally small this year because of a bad opium crop. Also, the water in the Tigris was so low that transport was much impeded. Curzon’s estimate for 1889 was 327,796/. The Karun route may some day he one of the most important of all. The existing value of our trade is small, and the last figures* show a decrease on those given by Curzon for 1890, the total being only 126,550/. as against 180,680/. But there is reason to hope that the state of things will not continue. We are now opening out the road from Ahwaz to Ispahan, and believe that we shall thereby effect a large saving of time and cost in comparison with the Bushire and Ispahan route, which is long and difficult. Also, we are trying to open out roads northwards from the Karun to Sultanabad, the centre of the carpet trade, and to Hamadan and the surrounding country. I attach much value to the Karun route, which, from the nature of things, is entirely in our hands, and protected from any serious competition. Some good judges believe it will before long be our main trade route. Its future, however, is by no means certain, and we must not feel too sanguine about it. The Bushire route is at present the most important of all, the volume of British trade for 1897 being estimated at 1,155,039/. This route must always be important, and seems likely to do well even if the Karun route develops. At piesent, it fills the country with British goods as far as Ispahan, where the Russian competition is small, and even supplies Tehran, 800 miles from the sea. The eastern ports have suffered, from the shrinking of the Khorassan and Afghan markets, and can show no increase on the figures given for 1889. Still they supply a very lar°’e tract of country, and their trade should not suffer any further from Russian comnetition. Thev ought easily to hold their own in Yezd, Kerman and South-eastern Persia generally. The value of their trade to ns in 1897 was estimated at 1,026,990 a-year. . ^ ^ The trade by the Kelat route is as yet small, but promises well. If we can succeed in* wishing our broods into Seistanfrom the south of Khorassan by the caravan 1 - - • 11 ^ ^ ^ India should decide to The estimated value road from Quetta, and especially if the Government of construct a railway, there may be a real future for this route. of the trade for 1898 is 39,329/. . . . i j u + a i-a Altogether if one looks at the map of Persia the position held by our trade is very remarkable. It is in full possession of the country up to and including a line drawn from Khanikin by Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, lezd and Kerman to Seistan Beyond that line it has begun to give ground both m the north-west and m Tehran and in Khorassan, but, in spite of great geographical disadvantages it has ty excluded. Its total value is estimated at over 3,488,000/. ibis is on the estimate given by Curzon for 1889, a rise ot no means been an increase of nearly 500,000/. * For the Karun and the Gulf ports I hare failed to get anr complete figures later than those of 1897. [392]16 cer cent in nine years. This is not, I think, a diseonragmg state of thmgs, Lnedally when it is considered that the last seven years have been for Persia a very nnluckv period in various ways. Year after year great tracts of territory in southern Persia have been devastated by locusts. Then we have had troubles consequent on the Tobacco Begie, and a severe epidemic of cholera and disorder following on the death of the Shah, and a succession of had crops, causing i „ -p • Shiraz there has been such scarcity that three years ago the Persian crops, causing a great rise in the prices of food. In Shiraz there has been such scarcity that three years ago the Persian Government contemplated importing wheat from India. Export of wheat has been Whirlf]pn for some time, and naturally the purchasing power of the population lias And I forbidden for some time, and naturally the purcht- .-l a i . - , been comparatively low, which has told on imports. And I imagine the plague m India has had a depressing effect on the Bombay and Karachi trade. Altogether, though we have suffered and must suffer from Ilussian competition m the north, our trade has on the whole increased, and with better seasons it gives fair promise of prosperity. It should he noted that the shrinking of the Khorassan trade is partly due to the fact that our goods now reach Central Asia by Batoum and Baku, and the Trans-Caspian Railway. The “ Kovoya Vremja ” writes very mournfully about this. Such are the principal changes which have taken place in Persia of late years; hut before summing them up, with a view of examining the present state of affairs and submitting proposals for improving our position, I think it may be desirable to state briefly what are our present establishments in the country, and what amount of money we spend on them. I append a sketch map which will give some idea of the political geography. The Diplomatic and Consular staff is as follows :— At Tehran, the capital, we have a Minister with three Diplomatic Secretaries, two Oriental Secretaries, a surgeon, and a Vice-Consul. The total cost of the Legation is estimated at 16,640Z.a-year, of which India pays 7,00(P. At Meshed, to the east, we have two officers of the Indian Political Service, who are also Consul-General and Vice-Consul, and a surgeon. The total cost of the Agency is estimated at 8,600/. a-year. This is paid by India. At Asteiaoad, to the north-east, we have a native Agent, who costs 48/. a-year This is paid by Her Majesty’s Government. . At Resht we have a Consulate, which costs 750/. a-year. This is paid bv Her Majesty s Government. * At Tabreez to the north-west, we have a Consulate-General, the cost of which is estimated at 9201. a-year. This is paid by Her Majesty’s Government J o the west of Tehran, at Kermanshah, on the Baqdad road we have a native Agent, who costs 241. a-year.

We might perhaps add about 1,500/. a-year for this and other minor charges, which I need not mention. Besides the Diplomatic, Political, and Consular establishments, it is to he observed that we maintain in Persia and the Persian Gulf a considerable Telegraph Department, with a numerous staff of English clerks. This department has been, and to some extent still is, a valuable organization for political and intelligence purposes. The telegraph clerks can supply much useful information at times, and in out-of-the-way places they are often called upon to act in somewhat responsible situations. The sketch map appended to this despatch shows the lines of telegraph through Persia and the Gulf. Of these the lines extending from Tehran to Bushire, and the line along the Gulf coasts to Eao, Task, Charbar, and the Kelat, are maintained by our telegraph staff, and are thoroughly efficient. The Persian line from Tehran to Meshed is inspected by our telegraph staff, and the Government of India give a Grant- in-aid of 20,000 rupees a year towards the cost of maintenance. We have an English clerk at Meshed. This line works well. The line from Tehran to Julfa in the north west is in the hands of the Indo-European Telegraph Company, which has its head quarters in London, but it is of no great use to us for political purposes, as it is closely watched by the Bussians. This line is efficient. The rest of the lines shown on the map are maintained and worked by the Persian Government, and are very inefficient indeed. We can now' go on to review as a whole the state of affairs in Persia in 1899, and to consider wdiat steps w r e can take to improve our position. The internal condition of the country, which v r as bad enough in 1895, is now in some respects decidedly worse. The Shah, though a more amiable man than his father, is v r eak, and easily misled; the Prime Minister has no power, and cannot control his colleagues or the Provincial authorities; the finances are in complete disorder, and the revenues are coming in very slovdy ; the troops are unpaid, and inclined to be mutinous; food is dear all over the country, and the people are discontented. Meanwdiile the Prussians have been actively pushing their trade and political influence in the north of Persia, and with some success. They have even succeeded in establishing posts along the Afghan border, and in making themselves felt in Seistan and Ispahan. On the other hand it is as true now- as in 1895 that the internal condition of Persia is not hopeless. She has practically no debt, and her resources are great. And though the influence of Itussia is perhaps predominant in Tehran, yet England has still a strong position throughout the country. The quiet succession of the Shah w-as regarded as being, and was in fact, a great success for us, and the Shah’s nomination ofliis eldest son as heir apparent, though the Russians were knowm to favour a younger son, also tended to increase our reputation. In various respects, His Majesty has showm goodwill towards us, and a decided disinclination to put himself under Russian control. In the south of Persia, that is up to a line drawn from Khanikin on the Turkish frontier, through Kerman shah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Y ezd, and Kerman to Seistan, our Irade and our political influence are paramount, and indeed, so far as Russia is concerned, almost exclusive. Russia has only just begun to touch the fringe of the zone at Seistan and Ispahan. Neither her Consular establish ments nor her trade extend beyond these points. In the north zone on the other hand, although the local influence of the Russians is strong, we have our Consular establish ments right up to the Russian border; and our trade, though^ it is suffeimg from Russian competition, is by no means beaten out of the field. The southern zone in fact is very much more in our hands, politically and commercially, than the northern zone is in Russian hands. All over Persia a large part of the telegraph system is worked by us in one form, or another, and our hank has established itself m l abreez and Resht and Meshed. Altogether, considering the advantages Russia has enjoyed, we have much reason to he surprised that our position should be as good as it is. Nevertheless, though things might he much worse than they are, it cannot be denied that, both from a political and a commercial point of view, our position is being threatened. We have now- to consider what are the steps we should take to maintain and this point I shall proceed on the assumption that we cannot hope to come to terms with Russia, and persuade her to join us m a policy of reform anc deveiopment^ted ^ Memoraildum 0 f 1895 that such a proposal, if made by us, might possibly he accepted by Russia, especially if it formed part of a larger scheme4 Under for the settlement of our relations in Asia, and 1 pointed out how advantageous such an arrangement would be for both countries. b&gt;ut I assume that tne scueuie is impracticable, D and that we must continue to work alone, with Knssia watchful and more or less antagonistic. ' ' these conditions, the question is what we can do by ourselves. y Memorandum of 1895 I answered that question in the following England by herself, especially if thwarted by Russia, cannot hope to overcome the opposition of interested persons in high places, and to carry a scheme of reform which will regenerate Persia. She can hardly hope, indeed, to carry any reform of radical importance, and must fall back upon her existing policy, contenting herself with maintaining the integrity and independence of Persia, watching and checking Russian aggression, gaining the goodwill, respect, and confidence of the Persian Government and people, developing trade and taking such opportunities as may occur of urging measures beneficial to the country.” words 'gmg measures Denehcial to tne country. In the body of the Memorandum I explained at length the difficulties in the way of all attempts at reform, and I proposed certain definite steps which we should take in prosecution of the general policy stated above. Substantially the answer now must, I think, be the same as in 1895, for sub stantially the position is the same. But the changes which I have noted in the internal condition of the country, and the recent efforts of the Russians in the north and centre of Persia, seem to make it necessary that I should supplement the proposals I made three years ago, and should explain, in somewhat greater detail, the measures which I think desirable. The, chief proposal which I have to make meets the question raised in your Lordship s despatches under reply. It is that we should increase and render more efficient our Consular establishments in Persia. ^n - a t ed at the beginning of this despatch, I have at various times recommended e establishment of Consulates m Seistan, Kerman, and on the Karun, and I have also advocated an improvement in the position of the Consul-General at Tabreez esTabli shment 6 of ^ ^ ^ C f s T 1 3 1 ” General at Tabreez have recommended the w u c = ^ s-:: Atr T t last suggestion is supported by Captain Sykes. -omicier Abbas.

Webb Ware and Brazier Creaa-h seem to put the matter beyond a doubt. We must keep Seistan in our zone. It is too valuable, and would be too dangerous in Russian hands, for us to let the Russians continue unchecked their efforts to close it to us and our trade. The necessity for having native Agents in neighbouring districts is not, I think, so clear. I have no great belief in the agency of what Surgeon-Major Creagh calls “ crafty, diplomatic natives,” unless they are very closely supervised. They often do more harm than good. But Captain Sykes will be able to advise after spending some months in Seistan. (&amp;.) It seems to be beyond dispute that a Consulate in Kerman is becoming yearly more necessary. We must maintain a thorough hold on Persian Beluchistan, in the interests of our adjoining Protectorate and of our trade. Kerman is the capital of this large and important province, and the head-quarters of the Governor-General, and a trade centre of some consequence. I am inclined to think that if we have a British officer in Kerman we do not want another at Bampur. Por the present, at least, I should try to do without, although we might send a native Agent there if the Consul thinks he can get a man who will not stir up mischief among the border v tribes. (c.) Shiraz is a place of great importance, both commercially and as the capital of Pars, and the residence of the Governor-General. Our Consul-General for Pars should know something of the province and its Ruler, over whom he should endeavour to establish a personal influence. Our interests in Shiraz should not be left to the present native Agent, who, according to all the accounts I receive, does very little good and some harm. I feel some doubt whether the Resident in Bushire, who has a great deal of work to do in the Persian Gulf, is not overweighted by the charge of Pars; and it may be necessary hereafter to appoint a special officer to that charge, but for the present I would try the arrangement I have suggested. (d.) It is, I think, evidently wrong that at a place like Ispahan, where our trade and our political influence have hitherto been in full possession, the newly-appointed Russian Consul should be better equipped thao our own. The former has 800/. a-year pay, a Secretary, and a free house, with other privileges, including an escort of cossacks. The latter has 600/. a-year pay, of which he has to give back 60/. in house rent, and 150/. office allowance. I would make him a Consul-General, and raise his allowances to the level of the Russian Consul’s. (e.) A Consulate on the Karun is perhaps the most necessary of all the appoint ments I have suggested. Ahwaz may hereafter become a very important trade centre, and from there we should work upon the Arabs and Bakhtiaris and Lurs, establishing our hold upon them, and opening up the routes through their country, and perhaps raising from among them an irregular levy. The Resident in Bushire would prefer for the present to keep our Consul at Mohammerah. I doubt the expediency of this, as he should get into touch with the Lurs and Bakhtiaris quite as much as with the Arabs of the Lower Karun. However this may be the Consul will probably require a native Agent or two for commercial work. We should, I think, for the present at least, leave the Karun under the Consul-General for Ears. Our merchants would prefer his being in direct communication with Tehran, and Captain Sykes in his Report on the Karun recommends this; but I do not think we should, until the necessity is very clearly proved, take away the district from the charge of the Consul-General. It is better that we should have the whole of the Gulf coast in one hand. ^/.) A British Vice-Consulate at Kermanshah is, I think, very desirable. _ Our trade^ bv the Bagdad route is increasing, and the route is a very important one in all respects. As I have shown, the British imports and exports by this route approach 1 000.000/. We must keep our hold on it if possible. Our native Agent, although a man of wealth and consequence, has from the time I have been in Persia done nothing for us, and has been a source of unending trouble and expense to the Legation owing to his' quarrels with the Persians. It is the more important to keep our hold on Kermanshah, because the Russians may at any time push on thcii load fiom Kazvin to Hamadan. A Vice-Consul at Kermanshah should be directly under the orders of the Consul-General at Tehran. x , , T . , (a ) With regard to Bunder Abbas, the British trade of this port and Lmgah aggregates over 1,000,000/.

The grounds for this are obvious. The centre this important place, the head-quarters of the heir apparent, “ d ® eti gets 6B0/. a-year pay, and 2701. office allowance. The Bu f ^ ttbe Turkfsh 2 000/. a-year pay and has a large staff of Secretaries and Mun. .. ^ Consul-General has 1,020/. pay and allowances, and is helped by a A ice-consul and Attache. Even the Erench Representative, who is not a Consul-General, and has very small interests to represent, gets 1,200 a-year in pay and allowances, and has the aid of a Vice-Consul. All the foreign Representatives have free houses. It ma^ be argued that we ought not to attempt to rival the Russian Consul at this pomf. think this is open to question, hut, in any case, it seems to me unjust to onr Repre sentative, and unwise in our own interests, to place him in a position ot such marked inferiority to all his colleagues. Air. AVood urges that he should be. allowed a personal assistant or confidential clerk. If the Vice-Consul is appointed in the first place to Tabreez, which will attract less attention, and spends part of his time there, a confidential clerk will perhaps he unnecessary. But the danger is that he will spend too much of his time there. AY T ith regard to the limits of the new Consular districts, I cannot as yet give a precise answer in all cases. The limits of the Seistan Consulate, for example, must he fixed hereafter, when experience has shown ns the best line of division to the north ward. The powers of the Kerman Consulate should extend to the Kerman territory ruled by the Persian Governor-General at Kerman. The limits of a Vice-Consulate at Bampur I cannot state with accuracy. The Consul on the Karun should have charge of the country down to the sea. and westward to the Turkish frontier, and eastward to the eastern border of the Bakhtiaris, and northwards to the northern border of Luristan. The Ahce-Consul at Kermanshah should have charge of the Kermanshah and Hamadan districts, and of the country northwards to the border of Azerbaijan. The Vice-Consul in Urumia should perhaps he appointed simply Vice- Consul at labroez, whecne he can he deputed to act under the Consul-General’s °ideis. the A ice-Consul at Bunder Abbas should have charge of the Gulf ports at east of Bushire, which form a Persian Governorship, and of Yezd and of Liyristan. ^ W01 ^ 01 ^ ^ ie precise limits of the several districts in communication wixh the officers on the spot. All, oi about all, the Consulates in Persia should have a small guard of Indian troopers, say six men, as at Aieshed. . These should be picked men, if possible from ancer regiments, and the non-commissioned officers should he trained surveyors As to the cost of the additional appointments which I have proposed,’ ! feel it d , lfflcult , t0 m f ke 1 a satisfactory estimate, because the English and Indian ways of looking at such charges are so essentially different. The posts under the suTofCev TwirtT' a «T iderable Scale &gt; and cosfa constderabi: mot money, those under the Foreign Office are maintained on a very moderate footing, and cost comparativelv little Eor examnlp rv i ; er ^ moae f at ® Tabreez costs altogether 920/ a-year while + th ® Cons [ llat e - General at 8 , 600 /. a-year, Wlnle the Consulate-General at Aieshed costs I believe the sumptuary allowance of the Consul-General The American missionaries are greatly troubled by the R at Bushire is ussian propaganda, and are entirely with larger us.than the pay of the Consul-General at Tabreez. As the work of the Consulates in Persia is not only Consular but political, and as a certain amount of show is very desirable in the East, I think the rates of pay and allowances given by Her Majesty s Government are much too low, and this view is evidently shared by the Russians. But I hesitate to propose appointments kept up on the Indian scale, because t ley would probably seem to Her Majesty’s Government out of all proportion to the impor- tallC Another^difficulty is that any new post maintained by the Government of India, for example Seistan or Bahrein, would probably be brought on the list of the Indian Political Department, and the Government of India would have to , reference to the interests of that Department as a whole. However, I would s as a basis of calculation that each Consul snonld have 600 i. a-year p,,y, 150/. ofhce allowance, and 50/. house rent-total 800/ ; and that each Vice-Consul should have 400/. pay, 50/. a-year office allowance, and 50/. house rent—total 500 . I whether this is enough, but anything less than this would certainly be too little.

He gets no . This may be somewhat increased by the necessity of maintaining native Agents.12 outside Persia, and he lias no British trade to look after. A Vice-Consul could do all that is required. The money now spent at Kerman would be saved if a pei nianent Consulate were established there. I may perhaps be excused for suggesting that we might possibly employ to better advantage some of the money spent at Meshed. No doubt it is an important centre, politically and commercially, and the Government of India, who find the money, may not care to divert any portion of it to other posts m Persia. But after all a large portion of our trade in Persia is British Indian trade, and the maintenance of Persia, as a political entity, is largely, if not mainly, desirable, on account of our Indian Empire. It certainly seems to me that some portion of the 8 , 600 /. spent at Meshed, and possibly some portion of the 7,700/. spent at Bushire, might be better employed elsewhere. At all events something could be spared for Seistan. However, there is room for difference of opinion on this point, and I can only suggest a saving of 1,471/. on Besht, Mohammerah, Kerman, Kermanshah, and Shiraz. The saving at Shiraz could hardly take effect immediately, as we should have to give the Nawab some pension. We might, however, add to our savings the Karun subsidy of 2,000/. a-year. In all probability Messrs. Lynch would not receive this proposal with favour, but I do not think they would abandon the Karun, where they are now firmly established. Half of the sum would go to Her Majesty’s Govern ment and half to the Government of India. The prospective payments and savings of the two Governments might perhaps be arranged as follows :— Payments. Seistan.. Kerman Bunder Abbas .. Karun . .

I have already explained the position of the Telegraph Department in Persia and on the Persian Gulf. I am using it now to some extent as a means of obtaining intelligence and it has at times been very useful in this way; but it should be made useful m other ways as well. Wherever we have a Consul or Vice-Consul, as at Rermaiisliah, Ahwaz, or Kerman, we ought to have an efficient telegraph line. The me m these places is thoroughly inefficient, and in Seistan there is no line at all. We can do something by pressing the Persian Government to repair and restore, and at limes by lending efficient signallers, and by deputing officers to inspect and advise. These things must be done with tact; but so far the Persian Government seems to have entertained no jealousy of our Telegraph Department, which, on the contrary has always been regarded with favour. It is difficult to make exact proposals with reference to this point, because circumstances vary so much in different places; but speaking generally, it seems desirable to spend some trouble, and money if necessary, m getting the Persian telegraph system into our hands as much as possible. We should try to construct the proposed land line from Kashan to the Kelat frontier, and should connect it, or get the Persian Government to connect it, through Seistan with Meshed. Eventually it should also be connected with the coast. I think we ought also to pay our Director better than we do. He ranks here next to the Minister, and he cannot maintain his position on a salary of 950/. a-year. The jRanager of the Imperial Bank gets more than three times this sum. It is important that the Director should be on good terms with the Persian Ministers and Notables, and be able to entertain them to some extent, and he should also he able to move about the countrv decently equipped. I will go into this matter separately and in detail, if the Government of India are prepared to accept the principle that the Telegraph Depart ment should be regarded in some sense as a political organization, and that some expense may legitimately be incurred to make it more efficient in that respect. I have now stated the main proposals which I have to make for improving our position in Persia. It is briefly that we should increase the numbers and efficiency of our Consular staff by the addition of certain Consulates and Vice-Consulates, and by improving the position of our Representatives in Tabreez and Ispahan; that we should open out roads in the Karan district and elsewhere, and possibly prospect for a *392!

In these two latter cases we have succeeded m changing the attitude of the Persian Government. The border has been delimited, and m a recent instance an obnoxious Governor was recalled from Bushire on our demand. Lhis has done much good. But cases still occur in which our interests and our representations are treated with small respect. Por example, the Persian Government, during my absence on leave, asked the Military Attache in this Legation to arbitrate in an important dispute between our native ilgent in Kermanshah and some Persian subjects. The Persian Poreign Minister undertook in writing to execute the Award, whatever it might be. The Award was given in December 1897, and, in spite of continuous pressure from the Legation, execution has been evaded up till now, every sort of^ frivolous pretext being advanced to put us off. In another arbitration case which occurred during my absence on leave, Mr. Hardinge agreed to abide by the Award of the Prime Minister. The Award provided for the transfer of certain mines from the possession of a British-protected subject, and the payment to him of certain sums of money which he had given as presents to the Poreign Minister and other high officials. The mines were at once transferred, hut the money has never been paid. Again, the Imperial Bank of Persia has, by its Concession, the exclusive right of issuing hank notes, yet hank notes have for years been issued in large numbers by certain Persian Associations, and though many representations have been made on the subject, the practice continues unchecked. I have just heard that several thousand notes have been printed in Pngland on behalf of one of these Associations, and that they are now on their way to Bushire. I shall submit these cases separately for orders, and in the meantime Ji^ do not ask for any general ruling or assurance on the part of Her Majesty’s Government with regard to our future treatment of such matters, hut I have thought it desirable to bring the point to notice, in order that the attitude of the iersian Government towards us may be clearly understood. hand ’ lf tlie -Persians are again anxious for a loan, and if they can s ^ ls v that the money will he properly spent, and not &lt;e eaten” by the chief officials, I would secure them a loan on easy conditions, reiving for the pavment of instalments noton material guarantees of the usual type, such as wouh/satisfv the l'etr §e ’ bUt ° n the Sreat P0Wer We have ° f P utt “S pressure upon thff Persian object 0 rtLTsLrhwIbTr nteeS ° £ t !“ e f U , SU ! 1 *yp e is &gt; 1 fear . to defeat our following passages occur GOTere “™t of India of the 11th August, 1898, the were important step towardTdetloping^he 'mturaV^^’ ^f^rirprofe ‘ an British influence.” P 8 the natural sources of Persia and increasing“We have recently heard of the resignation of the Amin-ed-Dowleh, on whom the title of Sadr-i-Azam was conferred as lately as last December, and from whom and from his colleagues so much was apparently hoped for in the direction of reforms. We are as yet without precise information as to the significance or cause of the Sadr-i- Azam’s resignation.” The fact is that the cause of the late Sadr-i-Azam’s resignation, or rather removal, was precisely the arrangement for the control of the customs duties. Unable to find any money for the daily expenses of the Shah and the conduct of the Administration, and feeling that his retention in power depended upon his doing so, the unfortunate Sadr-i-Azam very reluctantly accepted the offer of a small loan from the Imperial Bank, and put their receivers in charge of the customs. The measure was intensely unpopular among the Persian merchants, who had to pay their customs dues, and among the officials at head-quarters, who resented the interference of the Peringi. The Sadr-i-Azam was loudly denounced for having “sold Bushire to the English,” and in a few weeks he was dismissed from office. He is now living in seclusion at Tehran, never leaving his house, and his lifelong rival, the Amin-es- Sultan, who is opposed to all reform, and was strongly supported by the Russians, has been appointed Sadr-i-Azam in his place. In my Memorandum of 1895 I explained the great difficulty of effecting any reforms, notably in the customs system, and I added:— “ By pressing for them inconsiderately, we run the risk not only of failure, but of making ourselves disliked by the Shah and Sadr-i-Azam and other influential persons, and of driving them into the arms of Russia.” These words are just as true now as they were in 1895, and I would earnestly recommend that we should act with great caution in these matters. If we contemplate at any time helping the Persians to a loan, we should avoid insisting upon the immediate control of the custom-houses. A clause providing that control will he given if the instalments on the loan are not paid is, I think, the utmost that .we require. The custom-houses at Bushire, Lingah, and Bunder Abbas, through which passes yearly over 3,000,000/. of trade, lie under the guns of our ships, and we could at any time put a boat’s crew and a bank agent in possession of each, even if we had no Agreement at all. In my opinion, therefore, we can guarantee a loan, and thus let Persia ha--e money at very low interest, and put her under a real obligation without any appreciable risk. 1 hope that this view of the case maj' be considered by Her Majesty’s Government, and thatwe shall, in the case of another loan being contemplated, rely on our power rather than on material guarantees. I doubt whether that power is fully recognized by ourselves. The Persians have no doubt of it. They see that our frontier, that is, the frontier of Kelat and the sea, not to speak of Afghanistan, marches with theirs for 1,500 miles. They know very well that the Russians cannot help them in the south and south-east, and that m the Gulf Provinces such show of authority as they still exei'cise depends upon our forbearance, if not upon our support. For example, the port of Lmgah is now m possession of a revolted Arab Sheikh, whom the Persians have recognized as Governor. They have no power to coerce him, and begged me to send a gun-boat to do so. He would most gladly hoist our flag to-morrow. On the Karun also the Arabs are m possession, and ready at a word from us to throw off the semblance of lersian ^ The Gulf ports Mohammerah, Bushire, Lingah, and Bunder Abbas are at the mercv of our ships. So great is the respect of the Persians for our power that even £ the extreme north of our zone, among the fanatical town-bred population of Ispahan any demonstration on our part has immediate effect, two or three yeais ago there was t/ouble in Ispahan, and the Mollahs were stirring up mischief against the Europeans It happened that at this moment a British squadron was sent mto Tuikish wa eTs and news oT the movement was brought to Persia by the pubhc telegrams. The Missionary Bishop at Ispahan wrote to inform me that the hostile demonstrations airainst the Europeans had ceased at once, and that the attitude of the Mollahs had comnletely changed. He said that the change was caused by the news about our fle“tf which was apparently interpreted as an indication that the English were getting angry, mo^t al sens itiyeness was shown last year when the news of the battle of Omdurman became known. It spread like wildfire all over the f of tim notice^Four officers. I mention these facts to show that we are greatly feared in16 XI . wifi, pa«P make our wishes respected.

In my Memo- randum of 1895 I suggested our letting it be understood that aggressive action by Russia in the north of Persia would immediately result in decided action by us m the south. I still think that this is our proper policy. I do n°o mean that we should bully or unduly threaten the Persian Government, but I would let them understand that we cannot regard without concern any such action as, tor example, the pushing down of the Russian sanitary wedge towards Seistan, and that we shall, if these things happen, ask for compensations which the Persian Government may dislike. It. is easy to do this, and it may help the Persian Government to resist demands which otherwise they would find it difficult to avoid accepting- I think they should realize that any serious concession made in the north is likely to involve an equivalent concession in the south. Hitherto they have realized only the converse of the pro position. I fully recognize that it may he embarrassing for us to commit ourselves beforehand to any particular method of action, but the principle should be under stood. If Her Majesty’s Government do not give me orders to the contrary, this is the line I propose to take in the future. Similarly, to turn to another clause of my recommendations of 1895, if Her Majesty’s Government do not give me orders to the contrary I propose, in the event of the Shah’s death, to recognize provisionally the succession of the Yaliahd, as I did three years ago. I may now perhaps usefully recapitulate what I have written regarding the state of Persia in 1899, and the steps which should be taken to improve our position in the country. The internal condition of Persia is exceedingly had, worse in some respects than in 1895. The finances are in greater disorder, the troops and civil establishments are unpaid, food is dear, the Shah is a weak Huler who maintains no discipline, and his Prune Minister has no powers, so that there is practically no Government. The ussians have shown considerable activity in the northern provinces, pushing on roads, and energetically encouraging their trade, and making use of their missionaries among the Christian populations. They hare put “ sanitary ” posts along the Afghan jorder and have tried to establish their trade and influence in Seistan. They have Persiakhv^n &amp; C °T ^ 1 .

We should decide now to recognize the Shah's eldest son if the Shah dies. Finally, we should let it be clearly understood that encroachment by Russia in the north will entail concessions to us m the south. In conclusion, I think it will be as well to notice two objections which may be brought against these proposals : The first is, that if we already have in Persia a larger Consular staff than the ussians, as the sketch map shows, there seems to be no necessity for our increasing it. Theie is force in this objection j but the fact remains that the Russians are pushing our trade out of hTorthern Persia, and that they have begun to touch the northern fringe of our zone. The second objection which may be urged is that our action would be resented by the Russians, and would lead to counter-moves on their part. I fully recognize the force of this objection. No one can have realized more clearly than I have done the inexpediency of provoking Russia by an appearance of over-activity. I have repeatedly impressed this view upon our officers in Persia, and my Memorandum of 1895 and later despatches—notably, that of the 14th August, 1896—show how constantly the idea has been present to my mind. Nothing can be more foolish than fussy demonstra tions, or attempts to gain small successes at the expense of the Russians' and, except when active measures are necessary for the maintenance of our material interests, I would never advocate them. [ have throughout recognized that our proper course in this country is to stand on the defensive, and to avoid striking at the Russians, or performing any risky evolutions which might tempt them to fall upon us. But, at the same time, it seems to me that there must be limits to our caution in these respects, and that, if we are to maintain our position in Persia, we must be prepared to face a certain amount of displeasure on the part of the Russians. As I have shown in this despatch, they do not remain inactive because we do so. Our abstention, at the instance of the Government of India, from interference in Seistan, has not prevented them from pushing down to the Afghan frontier and trying to strangle our Indian trade, or from endeavouring, with some success, to establish their trade and influence in Seistan itself. Our studious friendliness in Tehran though pleasantly reciprocated, does not prevent them from doing all they can to injure our bank, the Russian Banque des Prets getting up runs upon it, and even the Russian Legation refusing its notes. Nor has our friendly attitude prevented them from establishing a Consulate in Ispahan, or pushing on the construction of the Resbt road. Whether we remain quiet or not the Russians, very properly, go on working for their own hand, and unless we make an effort sooner or later we shall find ourselves being quietly elbowed out of one position after another. If we do make the effort now we certainly may provoke them to increased activity, but it may have a contrary effect, and in any case I believe that if we keep strictly within our rights, and make no unnecessary demonstrations, we have no need to be afraid of what they can do. They ought not to be able to meet us on equal terms in our zone. Every Persian believes that sooner or later the countrv will be divided between England and Plussia, and the southerner from Zil-es-Sultan downwards, looks to coming under the rule of England. In a loose-knit country like Persia, the weak Central Government cannot easily over-ride local influence. In this respect it is fortunate for us that the Persians have fixed their capital so far north as Tehran. Even in Tehran, moreover, the influence of the Russians has its limits. Their geographical position makes them a threatening power in the north, and as most of the Government officials at Tehran are northerners, with property and interests in the north, the influence of the Russians in lehian is no doubt considerable. The northern official thinks it wise to keep on good terms with his future masters. But it must be remembered that the Persian lives from day to day and thinks the country will probably last his time, and, being inoidinatcly conceited, not to say arrogant, the Persians are far from liking the Russians, whose overbearing ways they find it hard to endure. Although the Russians are not omnipotent in Tehran—on the contrary, although the Persian Government is very much afraid of them, it still opposes to them a steady, passive resistance about which they complain very bitterly. The Shah and his advisers, who believe that we shall take the south only if Russia takes the north, will go as far as they dare m helping us to resist Russian encroachment, and if we show that we are m earnest I think they will £ro a long way. It must not be thought that they are entirely under Russian domination. They are not. Therefore in my opinion we should make up our minds18 lafmifp Imp of policy in Pcrsistj cind that that the time has come for us *0 ^ ^ ^uch regard for any displeasure which for the future we must adhere to it witnout 10 we mav thereby cause to the Russians. j have &amp;c .

I send round to eacli of my colleagues a draft of this very lengthy, but not, I hope, superfluous despatch, which is both the summing up of a correspondence of long duration with the Secretary of State about our Consular and other establishments in Persia; the suggested response to particular enquiries addressed to us in consequence of a recent despatch from Sir M. Durand; and an attempt—so far as I can gather, the first that has been made—to place upon a definite footing the share of responsibility for Persia that legitimately devolves upon the Government of India, and to indicate a line of conduct for the future. These, at least, are the objects which I have had in view in writing it; and if the result is to give, in any degree, shape or permanence to our policy towards Persia, perhaps the labour will not have been wasted. I shall be grateful if my colleagues will favour me with their views or suggestions on the whole or any part of the draft. The despatch, if approved, will not leave until the mail of September 14th. C[ub,zon],— 2-9-99. 4MINUTE by the VICEEOY on SEISTAN, dated September 4th, 1899. I propose, in this Minute, to examine the present aspect of the Seistan question in relation to our general policy towards Persia, and to the attitude of Kussia in Persia. In my book on Persia, I wrote a chapter on Seistan (Vol. I, Chap.. IX) which contained as full an account of that district, its history, 9 inhabitants, features, and commercial and political significance, as was then (1892) procurable. I also discussed the political ambitions of Russia in con- nection with Seistan (Vol. I, pages 201, 216-218, 235-244; Yol. II, pages 597- 598,605), and the question of a possible Seistan Railway from India in the future (Yol I, pages 237-214, 628-629). I ventured further to make certain recommendations, namely, that we should establish Consular or other rejiresent- ation (a) at Yezd, (b) at Kerman, (c) in Seistan, (d) at Bunder Abbas; (&lt;?) that the Kerman-Meshed trade route should be improved; (/) that a British trade route should be opened from Quetta to Seistan; (g) that the question of railway extension in the direction of Seistan should be considered. Of these recommendations, I am glad to say that, during the interval that has since elapsed, (a), (5), (&lt;?), (&lt;?) and (f ) have'already been carried into execution. In the despatch with which this Minute is enclosed, {d) is recommended by the Government of India. I propose shortly to discuss the present aspect of {g). The references which have been given will dispense me from recapitulating the elementary facts about Seistan; and I may commence with an account of what has happened during the past 7 years, leading up to a description of the status quo. 2. Seistan was in 1892 a beluk or sub-division of the district of Kain (capital Birjand) which is a part of the province of Khorasan (capital Meshed). The Government of Kain has for long been in the hereditary possession of a powerful family of Arab origin, wdiose head bears the title of Amir of Kain, and -who, until the centralising tendencies of recent years, exercised an authority almost independent of that of the Shah. Mir Alam Khan, who had filled the post for over a quarter of a century, died in 1891. Eor reasons into which it is not necessary to enter, the younger of his two sons, Ismail Khan, known as the Shaukat-ul-Mulk (now about 50 years of age), succeeded him as Governor of Kain at Birjand. The elder son, Ali Akbar Khan, known as the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, became Governor of Tabbas and Seistan,—posts which he only retains by the process, familiar in Persia, of the annual payment of a large sum in cash to the Shah. The third son, Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, now just grown up, was made Sartip or Commandant of the Kain forces. The Shaukat- ul-Mulk and he have generally, but perhaps erroneously, been believed to incline towards Russia, whose aim has been to get Seistan, now to some extent separated from Kain, re-incorporated in it, and absorbed as an ordinary administrative district in the province of Khorasan. Such an amalgamation would emphasize the dependence of Seistan upon Meshed, from which it is now in some measure separate. 3. Meanwhile the elder brother, or Hashmat-ul-Mulk, has not himself resided in Seistan, but has deputed one of his sons, Mir Masum Khan, a fat and lethargic youth of about 18, to act as Deputy Governor at Nasirabad, under the tutelage of his mother, a lady with considerable powbrs of intrigue. This son is supposed to intrigue with the uncle at Birjand and is not on the best of terms with his father, who in 1898 sent an elder son, named Muhammad Reza Khan, to supersede him as Deputy Governor. Upon Mir Masum Khan declin- in 0, to go, the quarrel was patched up; and he still acts for his father in Seistan. Thus the local situation is that of Russia endeavouring to increase her hold upont‘.s''?/ ns •’ = ’ '. m^.

His report was shown to the Shah, who agreed with Colonel Yate’s description of the political situation in Seistan, and, in so far as they concerned Persia, with his recommendations. The Government of India were, however, at that time under the impression, which has since been abandoned, that anv evidence of British interest in Seistan or in Eastern Persia would merely 'bring down the Russians (who have come down without it), and would tempt them to extend their railway southwards (which they have since done independently of any British move). Accordingly Colonel Tate s jiroposals were rejected. 5. Two years later Captain McMahon, who had been employed upon the demarcation of the Baluch-Afghan boundary (in pursuance of the Durand Agree ment of 1893), submitted a memorandum to the Government of India (dated June 21st, 1896), in which he strongly recommended the opening of the route which had been negatived in 1894, and the adoption of proper measures for its protection, and for the exercise of political authority up to the Persian border. The Government of India accepted these proposals, and submitted them to the Secretary of State in a despatch, dated September 16th, 1896. The latter replied on October 23rd, giving his sanction, and observing that—“ In the interest of the trade between India and Persia, it seems to me very desirable to further its development by this route”. In the ensuing month Lieutenant Webb Ware was appointed Political Officer at Chageh, and was instructed to establish levy posts, and to take other steps for the prompt execution of the new scheme. 6. This officer started upon his first visit to Seistan in January and returned in June 1897. He found Russian influence much in evidence in Seistan, where he pleaded for the early installation of a British Agent. With regard to the commercial possibilities of Seistan, he reported that “ Seistan’s staple products are gram ghi (clarified butter) and wool. If facilities for carriage were to he improved, it is by no means impossible that the future may see an extensive Perso-Baluch gram-trade called into existence”. Upon his outward, the hfhirt-n P ° f hlS re i tl i ru ’ j0Urn ? y ’ took ste P s &gt; b y the opening of wells, by the building of guard-houses and godowns, and by the institution of lew posts 7fiTono C s P rw 0 ^ 0f t th ? n T trade r0Ute ^ and he su ' ,m itted a number urthei pioposals, with that object m view, to the Government of India.

Their journey lasted from April till July 1898— unfortunately the hottest and least propitious season of the year. At its close Maula Bakhsh STNXV 8 r le ^ that d have yet re ^ O.ontbo country “e“e that ihe Indian traders with my caravan, although disappointed by losses of camels difficulties of transport and want of water at certain places, have not formed an unfavourable view of the new trade route, and they intend to advise their firms to send goods by it in the future”. There were wanted however, better arrangement for water-supply, more godowns, and sunerior provision for storing fodder. The road was pronounced not yet suitable for merchants, travellers, or pilgrims, unaccustomed to rough travelling. Never theless the journey from Meshed to Quetta—62 marches or 1,090 miles—was performed by Maula Bakhsh and his caravan in 65 days. Including the average number of halts, vtz., 10, he pointed out that the normal duration of the journev e.e., 72.days, would yet .be shorter than the 75—90 days usually occupied in traversing the alternative route, 966 miles long, between Meshed and Bunder Abbas. 9. In the same year, 1898, Lieutenant Webb Ware submitted his first Annual Report, which, in spite of the obstructive measures adopted by the Russian officers on the pretext of plague in Khorasan, recorded a gratifying advance. . In an appendix on Nushki trade, he pointed out that the route was growing in favour, and that out of nothing had been created a trade which had risen from 1| lakhs in 1896 to Rs. 5,90,000 in 1897. The main impediments were the total lack of supplies, other than those specially imported, on the road between Nushki and the Seistan frontier, and the illegal extortion of the Persian toll-collectors (many of them in Russian pay) in Persian terri tory. Notwithstanding, he thought that the Quetta-Seistan route would even tually heat the Bunder Abbas route to Meshed, because merchandise carried by the latter required to change hands several times in transit, because a longer time was required for the journey thereby, and because the road was less secure than one running uninterruptedly through British territory. 10. In the present year, the same officer’s second Annual Report testifies to a continued improvement both in the amenities of the route, and in the trade returns, which have increased by Rs. 1,38,000 since 1897. A new bazar, containing 126 shops, has been laid out at Nushki, which has developed from a petty group of daub and wattle huts into a small town; and which, now that the Nushki district has been (in the summer of 1899) permanently taken over by the Government of India, is certain of a prosperous future. Through out the past year a weekly dak has been maintained from Quetta to the Seistan frontier, in correspondence with a bi-weekly Persian dak from thence via Nasirabad and Birjand to Meshed. Alterations and short cuts in the route have reduced the distance from Nushki to Meshed to 954 miles, as compared with 966 miles from Bunder Abbas to the same destination. 11. An independent light has been thrown upon Seistan in the same period by the visit of Captain Sykes, who was despatched thither as Consul at the end of 1898 in consequence of the appointment of a Russian Consul to Nasirabad. Captain Sykes, who has for some time been Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, and who has been greatly interested in the rival Bunder Abbas- Kerman-Meshed trade route, arrived in Seistan in January 1899, with pre possessions already so strongly formed in favour of the older route, and against the new competitor, that before he had been there a week, he pronounced against the permanent appointment of a Political Officer to Seistan, and in[ 4 ] , , n T -„„. n He was also in a position to say that “ the favour of his own return to Ke ■ j j handicapped by its natural Quetta route which he had , n Xr conclusions of Captain Sykes were vigorously disadvantages” These and ^/“^fand Consul-Geneml at Meshed. But disputed by Golonel Temp , ° h ; the re verse side of the shield to that they are not without heir ti | ism , be en displayed by the various which has perhaps, withap ^ .^1^ inception or development of the •’ W fcL the® Indian side. In subsequent letters, Captain Sykes reiterated enterpise from t^® p d ^' or j£y j^respectTof water, camel-grazing, and sup- his opinions as to P out ^ SQ , P. receded from his original attitude as plies of the Bunder opening on the Indian route for imports of tea Indlnlir^ratTpolS^ its opening was important, adding, “ he kr-er the parties that visit Seistan and the more frequently they appear, the greater the political effect will he ”. On February 14th, he explained “ how necessary it is to provide the funds, by the careful expenditure of which Seistan may he brought nearer to India ”, and urged that “ it is of paramount import- ance to take advantage of the proximity of our frontiers and not to allow Russian trade and influence to he pushed to our very door ”. On April i 8th, while adhering to his views about the superiority of the Bunder Abbas road over the Indian ?onte, he nevertheless remarked that “ the Seistams generally, and the Baluchis in particular, all look towards the East and South, while their local commerce is now mainly carried on with Quetta , and that the revival of the Seistan-Quetta route, the buildings erected along it and the other proofs of British activity, have helped to increase our prestige He now advocated placing a smart Muhammadan native agent in Seistan {£ to supervise the post which I earnestly hope will he made permanent” ; and in a later letter, on May 11th, he urged “ the establishment of an Indian Post Office at Birjand, as well as in Seistan, with a competent news-writer for each district wdiich ‘‘modest scheme should he sanctioned and carried out without delay In the last letter received from him, dated June 1st, Captain Sykes expressed his final opinion as adverse to the appointment of a British Consul for Kain and Seistan, unless a Russian Consul were sent (in which case it w r onld become obligatory). It will he seen, therefore, from a synopsis of Captain Sykes’s reports, that, while he remains unfavourable to the prospects of the Quetta-Seistan route, as compared with the old trans-Persian road, he has come round to the opinion, which no previous traveller in Seistan has questioned, that it is essential that British interests, commercial and political, should be sustained in that quarter by an energetic and liberal maintenance of the line of connec tion with India, hut that, for their support in Seistan itself, it will be sufficient for the present, unless a more active course he imposed by Russian initiative, to rely upon Indian native agents. These recommendations I have accepted in the draft despatch to the Secretary of State. I should add that Colonel Temple, who has throughput disputed many of Captain Sykes’s statements and dissented from his conclusions—partly owing to a not unfounded suspicion that Captain Sykes was advising in a spirit of undue independence of Meshed— has urged, in view of the recent renewal of plague alarms in Eastern Persia, that a native agent, if sent from India, should be a medical officer, charged in addition with the necessary political work. Although I believe these alarms to have been factitious, and to have been fomented by Russia for political purposes m 1899, as in 1897, I have so far acted upon Colonel Temple’s advice as to send a Hospital Assistant from Quetta to Seistan as news-writer and te f S e 6 is t r ths - Sucl1 is the present state ° £ ° ur 12 It will he seen from what I have wvitten that Seistan is bv virtue cf BrS SUuated luhe ™?t °f both to Russia and Great istan, and“ilt Kutm^Xte fhelstie^fIlHr^’ advance can be made from Khorasan to the sea exce^ fh J^T’ ? ulf ’ T position upon the exposed flank of Afghanistan wouldhenSoec^atten ofgreat value to any Power contemplating either a move against that countrv m* an advance upon Kandahar.

Purtheianore, the grain- producing capabilities of the district, to the bygone richness of which eloquent testimony is borne by the immense number of ruined cities encumbering the soil, and which could without serious difficulty be revived by a scientific employ ment of the waters of the Helmand, render Seistan of much value, as a possible gianary, either to a Power engaged upon a forward advance, or to a Power interested m commercial and iudustrial expansion. n ^ he force of , these circumstances has, it will have been observed, com- pelled the Government of India to display a concern in Seistan, which, at the start, they were most reluctant to acknowledge, and which, at varying intervals since they have, with unconscious inconsistency, affected to repudiate. I have already Pn at re t urne( t to Colonel Yate in 1894. Between 1894 and 1898 the N ushki-Seistan trade route was, with the sanction and upon the encourage ment of the Secretary of State, deliberately opened by the Government &amp; of India; a Political Officer was appointed to administer the district between JNushki and the Persian border; officers were repeatedly despatched to report upon the country and to evince an interest in its fortunes. And yet as recently as August 10th, 1898, the Government of India wrote to the Secretary of State that they shared the apprehensions of Lord Dufferin’s Government in 1887 that activity in the direction of Seistan might lead to a forward move on the pait of Bussia , and that ee premature activity was likely to prevent or post pone the future success of the new route from Quetta to Seistan”. 14. I am quite unable to understand either the force of this logic or the consistency of this conduct. The cautious and, in its motive, praiseworthy abstention of the Government of India from displaying any interest in Seistan, did not for one moment affect the designs, or retard the advance of Russia in that direction. Russian new r s-writers were firmly established in the district before anything more than a casual visit had been paid by a British officer. While members of the Government of India w r ere writing notes to show that, if even a caravan route were opened from Quetta in the direction of Seistan, the Russians would extend their trans-Caspian Railway southwards, the latter were already at work, laying their rails from Merv to the Kushk post, and preparing the plant for an ultimate extension to Herat. Sir M. Durand, in a paragraph of his recent despatch, has exposed the hollowness of this plea; and I venture to hope that it may not figure again in our reasoning. 15. Similarly, I am unable to comprehend how—the trade route having been deliberately opened—any activity in developing it can either be premature, or can possibly prevent or postpone hopes which the trade route itself has been called into existence to realise, and which, without it, would have had no being. Either the Nushki-Seistan trade route is a bona-fide enterprise, upon which we have designedly embarked, in the main, because of its commercial possibilities, but also not without an eye to the extreme political importance of Seistan; or it is a fortuitous and foolish experiment, not likely or intended to succeed. In the latter case let us be wise and drop it. In the former let us be honest, and make the best job of it that we can. 16. I have no hesitation in recommending the last named course : and I do so, not because I am carried away by the gratifying, though modest, achieve ments of the new trade route up to date, nor because I contemplate for it an early and brilliant success. On the contrary I regard the obstacles and difficul ties as considerable; and, knowing the traditional conservatism of the East, I recognise that commerce will not readily be diverted into a new, and, at first sight, somewhat unattractive channel. But I urge a strenuous continuation of the venture, wuth an eye to a twofold contingency, political and commercial, in the future. 17. In the first place if we do not continue to show an active interest in Seistan, Russia will. If we do not give the impression there of preponderant[ 6 ] n * em+tmrifv will soon supplant ours. If, eitlior by plague influence, Russian autno y Spi«tan traffic be killed, there will only remain cordons or otherwrse the Nushki-Seisten temo ^ ^ ^ ^ the single access of the ^™«er ado^ ^ If ^ dQ ^ and this it will he easy j-,, * 1 ,., p P rsian Gulf the obvious method is to block fS^SnfJTo* l'™ tb, Looking lo lb. foture of Koifk.rn Kb™,, 4 -iye ^ 1 SrKra^*aJt= obiect to draw the line of demarcation between the Russian aud the British spheres oujeob luuic^ nnrl not in hers. The home districts of at the point best suited to our interests, and not to hers. Rhorasan end with Turbat-i-Haidari, 80 miles south of Meshed. They will doubtless follow the fortunes of the capital. 18 South of this district comes that of Kain already possessing a semi-independent chiefship, which might very well be retained as a buffer between the opposing spheres. Seistan should, for all the reasons given, be included in the British sphere of interest. It is no exaggeration to say that we cannot afford to see it excluded. 19. Secondly, a study of the history and features of Seistan, no less than of all modern reports upon it, leads to the conclusion that the future of that country will depend, as did its past, upon the proper employment of the immense water-supply from the Helmand that now runs riot and goes to waste in vast lagoons, and reed-beds, and swamps. The greater part of Seistan is, during several months in the year, under inundation. Captain Sykes, in one of his letters, has estimated its present population at 60,000. In another, he has said that, under a proper system of irrigation, the land would support “ perhaps a tenfold population ”. In a third he has said that, if the Helmand were properly controlled, the population might rise to a million or more. It is clear, therefore, that the future of Seistan will lie with those who control the entire course of the Helmand. It should be in their power to turn the desert into a garden, and to make the wilderness blossom like a rose. 20. Now it can hardly be doubted that a day will come, when, in response to an external challenge, Great Britain will be obliged to advance to Kandahar. So fully is this probability admitted, that the arrangements for the advance, including the rails, the mobilisation camp, and the water-supply at Chaman have already been made. When Kandahar is re-occupied, the valley of the Helmand will be occupied with it. Then will come the time, when the channel and the valley of that river, now running parallel to the British border, though at no great distance from it, having passed under British control, the regenera tion of Seistan will for the first time become practicable, and it will be possible to revive its former fame as one of the granaries of that part of Asia. No wise man can be anxious to precipitate or even to hasten that consummation But on the other hand no wisdom in the world can greatly retard it; and when the hour strikes, it would seem to me to be as well that Seistan should be waiting ItivelmWs o/ofhcS ead ° f ^ ^ abs0rbed iu tbe re § en - 21 .

When this has been done, it will be time to push forward into Persia ,, . 23. General Brackenbury’s criticism was destructive of the proposal viewed as an offensive and strategical scheme. But a corresponding flaw in his ov\n argument was. at once pointed out by Lord Salisbury, who noted that the real object of a Seistan railway would be not to attack Russia in Northern I ersia, but to save Southern Persia from falling into her grasp, which could be done either by a line from Quetta, or, as he would himself prefer, by a line irom rne sea. .24. General Brackenbury’s criticism was sent out to the Government of India, and was thus noted upon by Sir G. Chesney on January 13th, 1891 “ The railway can only be regarded as a work of military precaution. Prom this point of view it appears to me that the time cannot be far distant when it will be deemed. necessary. Still more important is a railway from the Persian Gulf north to Seistan; but the connecting link between this line and the Quetta railway system will also be found necessary”. . A fiRle Sir H. Brackenbury, now Military Member in India, again noted upon the scheme; and it is interesting to read his remarks in the light of. his former opinion. He now explained (April 27th, 1891) that he had only objected to a Seistan railway, so long as thejj Russian railway did not extend south of the Trans-Caspian line, and because to construct a railway to Seistan would compel her to make extensions. “ But if circumstances should change, and if Russia should take the lead in making railways southward, then it may become necessary for us to follow her lead. We ought to be able to keep pace with her ”,[ § 1 the Government of 26. These conditions “.^^jth'thescheme. The question of a more India decided to proceed no f considered in connection with southerly line from the “er Kej and Panjgur-a project which Sir E. Sandeman s proposal _ . Browne .

Since then the questote not heen^evne^o^e n tiv6; fir? tly, that the idea of a Seistan railway does not appear to have ever been considered by. the Govern- a Seistan railway oni P point 0 f yi e w in which, in my opinion, it ought STe re” ded,L., as a protective, and not an offensive measure The reason ne,-haps D is that, at that time, Russia had not given such unmistakable evidence of hel intention to move southward from Meshed, and to draw Seistan. withm the radius of her political influence. The railway was accordingly discussed and condemned, Is a means of attacking Russia m Northern Persia not as a means of keeping Russia out of Southern Persia. Moreover at that time, the Quetta-Seistan trade route not having yet been opened, the possible commer cial value of the line was not taken into account at all. Secondly, it will be noticed that the conditions postulated by Sir H. Brackenbury m London as precedent to anv idea of railway construction in this quarter have since been realised. Baluchistan is rapidly being developed ; _ the frontier tribes have passed com- pletely under our control; a permanent line of communication with Seistan has been opened; while the very conditions which he said, when in India, might compel a change of attitude on our part— viz., Russian initiative in the process of southerly extension from her existing railway system—have been fulfilled by the construction on her part, without provocation or incentive from us, of the Merv-Kushk line. It is clear, therefore, that the question stands on a different footing from any that it has previously occupied; and that the facts and arguments which weighed with our predecessors are inapplicable to the present situation. 28. As regards the physical and engineering difficulties by which such a line might he confronted, I may cite the following opinion from the report in 1897 of Lieutenant Webb Ware: “ No one who has traversed this country can fail to he struck with the marvellous facilities which the country between Nushki and Seistan offers for the construction of a railway. Scarcely a single material obstacle exists to bar the road; throughout the gradient is exceedingly gentle; hands of sand can as a rule be avoided; of fuel there is an abundance; while not a bridge of more than one span, or engineering work of any magnitude, is requisite. Added to this the mineral wealth of the Koh-i-Sultan and the hills to the west, at present lying untouched, is so considerable as in itself to offer very great inducements to railway enterprise. Sucb a railway would place the trade of Lastern Persia and Seistan at our feet, unlock such Central Asian markets as are now closed, give ns a preponderating influence in Eastern Persia, and opened to India the rich grain fields of Seistan ”. 29. It would appear, therefore, that so far as gradients, water-crossings, and fuel are concerned, little or no difficulty would be met with in laying a line across the 400 and odd miles that intervene between Nushki and Seistan. On the other hand, I am inclined to think that at present a verv serious obstacle would present itself in the complete dearth of water over Ion/stretches of this route, and m the problem of the shifting sands. Both of thele difficulties have faZ—rnKton W S T ^ and^thtfaS ofa iar &amp; e permanent stall, upon her Trans-Caspian Railway. She has had moreover the assistance of a settled population and the advantage of numerous TnhXted sites along the railway line These advantages would, at anymte at the start sssaatssyaRaiSBrtfT- not be remune.ative; while tWS w/tV ' ^ rapidity ’ W ° uld , xe iue railway would have no other immediate use,inasmuch as it would not be a line of connection between important centres of population, industry, or arms, but would, so to speak, end in the air. If it stopped at the Anglo-Persian border, it would still be 90 miles distant from Nasirabad, the capital of Seistan. The chances of prolongation to the latter would appear to be problematical in view of the engagements against the intro duction of railways, which Persia has allowed to be imposed upon her by Russia. The question of the military protection of the line, if constructed, is one upon which expert opinion would be required to pronounce; although, in the yearly increasing tranquillity of the districts which it would traverse, I do not conceive that any serious difficulty would thereby be caused. 30. The Government of India have in the accompanying despatch suggest ed the desirability of coming to an understanding with Russia concerning spheres of interest in Persia, which would leave Seistan within the British zone. In such a case there might he no necessity, at any rate for the present, for a Quetta-Seistan railway. We could then devote ourselves to the diligent promo tion of the resuscitated caravan route, and look forward to the day, when, the Helmand being in our hands, we might convert Seistan into a flourishing out post on the flanks of British India, that would call for railway connection with the lines and resources of the interior. 31. Even in the event of such an understanding being declared impracti cable, while I hold firmly to the opinion that we should then he hound to adopt such measures for the protection of Southern Persia and of our interests in that quarter as we might deem desirable, and while I concur with Lord Salisbury in thinking that a Quetta-Seistan railway might he found to he one of these, I am yet in favour of consolidating our position in the interim, of fostering the incipient trade, of acquiring further information about the tracts to be traversed, and of familiarising the Perso-Baluch border lands, and Seistan in particular, with our presence and influence, before we decide upon such a forward move. It would at any time be a comparatively easy task to connect Quetta by railroad with Nushki (90 miles); and such an extension would afford no inconsiderable relief to the Persian caravans, who now have to proceed with their camels to Quetta, where there is no camel-grazing and, where the prices for fodder are high, instead of returning at once, after a few days’ rest, from Nushki. But I should like to see Nushki also developed, as I believe it is likely to be, by an interval of settled British administration, and by the measures which I am recommending in connection with the trade route, before I advocate even this advance. In a few years’ time we shall be in a better position to pronounce upon ideas, the execution of which would for the present be somewhat in the nature of an experiment. September 4th, 1899. CURZON.MINUTE by the VICEEOY on SEISTAN, dated September 4th, 1899. I propose, in this Minute, to examine the present aspect of the Seistan question m relation to our general policy towards Persia, and to the attitude of Itussia in Persia. In my book on Persia, I wrote a chapter on Seistan (Vol. I Chap.. IX) which contained as full an account of that district, its history’ inhabitants, features, and commercial and political significance, as was then (1892) procurable. I also discussed the political ambitions of Eussia in con nection with Seistan (Vol. I, pages 201, 216-218, 235-244; Yol. II, pages 597- 598, 605), and the question of a possible Seistan Railway from India in the future (Yol. I, pages 237-244, 628-629). I ventured further to make certain recommendations, namely, that we should establish Consular or other represent ation (a) at Yezd, (b) at Kerman, (c) in Seistan, (d) at Bunder Ahhas; (&lt;?) that the Kerman-Meshed trade route should be improved; (/) that a British trade route should he opened from Quetta to Seistan; Q/) that the question of railway extension in the direction of Seistan should be considered. Of these recommendations, I am glad to say that, during the interval that has since elapsed, (a), (b), (c), (e) and (jf) have already been carried into execution. In the despatch with which this Minute is enclosed, [d) is recommended by the Government of India. I propose shortly to discuss the present aspect of {g). The references which have been given will dispense me from recapitulating the elementary facts about Seistan; and I may commence with an account of what has happened during the past 7 years, leading up to a description of the status quo. 2. Seistan was in 1892 a beluh or suh-division of the district of Kain (capital Birjand) which is a part of the province of Khorasan (capital Meshed). The Government of Kain has for long been in the hereditary possession of a powerful family of Arab origin, wdiose head hears the title of Amir ot“ Kain, and who, until the centralising tendencies of recent years, exercised an authority almost independent of that of the Shah. Mir Alam Khan, who had filled the post for over a quarter of a century, died in 1891. Eor reasons into which it is not necessary to enter, the younger of his two sons, Ismail Khan, known as the Shaukat-ul-Mulk (now about 50 years of age), succeeded him as Governor of Kain at Birjand. The elder son, Ali Akbar Khan, known as the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, became Governor of Tabbas and Seistan,—posts which he only retains by the process, familiar in Persia, of the annual payment of a large sum in cash to the Shah. The third son, Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, now just grown up, was made Sartip or Commandant of the Kain forces. The Shaukat- ul-Mulk and he have generally, but perhaps erroneously, been believed to incline towards Russia, whose aim has been to get Seistan, now to some extent separated from Kain, re-incorporated in it, and absorbed as an ordinary administrative district in the province of Khorasan. Such an amalgamation would emphasize the dependence of Seistan upon Meshed, from which it is now in some measure separate. 3. Meanwhile the elder brother, or Hashmat-ul-Mulk, has not himself resided in Seistan, but has deputed one of his sons, Mir Masum Khan, a fat and lethargic youth of about 18, to act as Deputy Governor at Nasirabad, under the tutelage of his mother, a lady with considerable powers of iutrigue. This son is supposed to intrigue with the uncle at Birjand and is not on the best of terms with his father, who in 1898 sent an elder son, named Muhammad Reza Khan, to supersede him as Deputy Governor. Upon Mir Masum Khan declin ing to go, the quarrel was patched up; and he still acts for his father in Seistan. Thus the local situation is that of Russia endeavouring to increase her hold u23on—- _ mlr l 2 ] the ruler of Kain (to whom ^ ie 4 s ®^’. a ^ti^ruler'of Kain endeavouring to veying presents valued at JWOO^andt himselL oust his brother and to es British Consul-General at Meshed (in the appointment of * ^idish U ^ wWch is 4.

His report was shown to the Shah, who agreed with Colonel Yafe* description of the political situation m Seistan, and in so far as they concerned Persia, with his recommendations. The Government of India were, however, at that time under the impression, which has since been abandoned, that anv evidence of British interest in Seistan or m Eastern Persia won d merely 'briim down the Russians (who have come down without it), and would tempt them to extend their railway southwards (which they have since done independently of any British move). Accordingly Colonel Yate s proposals were rejected. 5. Two years later Captain McMahon, who had been employed upon the demarcation of the Balnch-Afghan boundary (in pursuance of the Durand Agree ment of 1893), submitted a memorandum to the Government of India (dated June 21st, 1896), in which he strongly recommended the opening of the route which had been negatived in 1894, and the adoption of proper measures for its protection, and for the exercise of political authority up to the Persian border. The Government of India accepted these proposals, and submitted them to the Secretary of State in a despatch, dated September 16th, ] 896. The latter replied on October 23rd, giving his sanction, and observing that—“ In the interest of the trade between India and Persia, it seems to me very desirable to further its development by this route”. In the ensuing month Lieutenant Webb Ware was appointed Political Officer at Chageh, and was instructed to establish levy posts, and to take other steps for the prompt execution of the new scheme. 6. This officer started upon his first visit to Seistan in January and returned in June 1897. He found Russian influence much in evidence in Seistan, where he pleaded for the early installation of a British Agent. With regard to the commercial possibilities of Seistan, he reported that “ Seistan’s staple products are grain, ghi (clarified butter) and wool. If facilities for carriage were to he improved, it is by no means impossible that the future may see an extensive Perso-Baluch grain-trade called into existence”. Upon his outward, and again upon his return, journey, he took steps, by the opening of wells, by .e m mg of guard-houses an d godowns, and by the institution of levy posts, rvfV 1 ?v CIierSetlG P f° niotl , on 1 of tlle P e w trade route; and he submitted a number ur ler proposa s, with that object in view, to the Government of India.

At its close Mania Bakhsh u hose report is the best that I have yet read upon the country traversed wrote t iat Ihe Indian traders with my caravan, although disappointed by losses of camels difficulties of transport and want of water at certain places have not formed an unfavourable view of the new trade route, and they intend to advise their firms to send goods by it in the future”. There were wanted however, better arrangement for water-supply, more godowns, and superior provision for storing fodder. The road was pronounced not y^ suitable for merchants, travellers, or pilgrims, unaccustomed to rough travelling. Never- ic ess the journey from Meshed to Quetta—62 marches or 1,090 miles—was performed by Mania Bakhsh and his caravan in 65 days. Including the average number of halts, «*., 10, he pointed out that the normal duration of the joumev- 72 days, would yet be shorter than the 75—90 days usually occupied in traversing the alternative route, 966 miles long, between Meshed and Bunder A 9 'i J n tl l e sn , me y ? ai ’’ 1 ? 98 ’ Lieutenant Webb Ware submitted his first Annual iieport, which, in spite of the obstructive measures adopted by the Russian officers on the pretext of plague in Khorasan, recorded a gratifying advance. . In an appendix on Nushki trade, he pointed out that the route was growing in favour, and that ont of nothing had been created a trade which had risen from lakhs in 1896 to Rs. 5,90,000 in 1897. The main impediments were the total lack of supplies, other than those specially imported, on the road between Nushki and the Seistan frontier, and the illegal extortion of the Persian toll-collectors (many of them in Russian pay) in Persian terri tory. Notwithstanding, he thought that the Quetta-Seistan route would even tually beat the Runder Abbas route to Meshed, because merchandise carried by the latter required to change hands several times in transit, because a lono-er time was required for the journey thereby, and because the road was less secure than one running uninterruptedly through British territory. 10. . In the present year, the same officer’s second Annual Report testifies to a continued improvement both in the amenities of the route, and in the trade returns, which have increased by Rs. 1,38,000 since 1897. A new bazar, containing 126 shops, has been laid out at Nushki, which has developed from a petty group of daub and wattle huts into a small town; and which, now that the Nushki district has been (in the summer of 1899) permanently taken over by the Government of India, is certain of a prosperous future. Through out the past year a weekly dak has been maintained from Quetta to the Seistan frontier, in correspondence with a bi-weekly Persian dak from thence via Nasirabad and Birjand to Meshed. Alterations and short cuts in the route have reduced the distance from Nushki to Meshed to 954 miles, as compared with 966 miles from Bunder Abbas to the same destination. 11. An independent light has been thrown upon Seistan in the same period by the visit of Captain Sykes, who was despatched thither as Consul at the end of 1898 in consequence of the appointment of a Russian Consul to Nasirabad. Captain Sykes, who has for some time been Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, and who has been greatly interested in the rival Bunder Abbas- Kerman-Meshed trade route, arrived in Seistan in January 1899, with pre possessions already so strongly formed in favour of the older route, and against the new competitor, that before he had been there a week, he pronounced against the permanent appointment of a Political Officer to Seistan, and in1 1 |,T ' [ ^ ] , .

It will he seen, therefore, from a synopsis of Captain Sykes’s reports, that, while he remains unfavourable to the prospects of the Quetta-Seistan route, as compared with the old trans-Persian road, he has come round to the opinion, which no previous traveller in Seistan has questioned, that it is essential that British interests, commercial and political, should be sustained in that quarter by an energetic and liberal maintenance of the line of connec tion with India, hut that, for their support in Seistan itself, it will be sufficient for the present^ unless a more active course he imposed by Russian initiative, to rely upon Indian native agents. These recommendations I have accepted m the draft despatch to the Secretary of State. I should add that Colonel Temple, who has throughout disputed many of Captain Sykes’s statements and dissented from his conclusions—partly owing to a not unfounded suspicion that Captain Sykes was advising m a spirit of undue independence of Meshed- has urged, m view of the recent renewal of plague alarms in Eastern ’* addition whli ^? en ^ ^ Sen ^ ^ r01 ^ ?- n ^ a ’ should be a medical officer, charged m tf a^ Although I believe these alarms purposes in 1899 1 i ° W fomented Russia for political Is to send a Hosn a V S ° ^ acted ll P°?

Nor will it be denied that the Kandahar-lferat dXnd° f .d ld n0t ^ ld wia ? afet y ty India, nor the valley of the Helmand defended, were a hostile Power m possession of Seistan. Furthermore, the grain- producing capabilities of the district, to the bygone richness of which eloquent testimony is borne by the immense number of ruined cities encumbering the soil, and which could without serious difficulty be revived by a scientific employ ment of the waters of the Helmand, render Seistan of much value, as a possiMe granary, either to a 1 ower engaged upon a forward advance, or to a Power interested m commercial and industrial expansion. n ^ orce ^ese circumstances has, it will have been observed, com- pe led the Government ot India to display a concern in Seistan, which, at the start, they were most reluctant to acknowledge, and which, at varying intervals since they have, with unconscious inconsistency, affected to repudiate. I have alreadv Sat tl i e , retumed to Colonel Yate in 1891. Between 1894 and 1898 the N ushki-Seistan trade route was, with the sanction and upon the encourage ment of the Secretary of State, deliberately opened by the Government°of India ; a l olitical Officer was appointed to administer the district between JNushki and the Persian border; officers were repeatedly despatched to report upon the country and to evince an interest in its fortunes. And yet as recently as August 10th, 1898, the Government of India wrote to the Secretary of State that they shared the apprehensions of Lord Dufferin’s Government in 1887 that activity in the direction of Seistan might lead to a forward move on the part of liussia”; and that “ premature activity was likely to prevent or post pone the future success of the new route from Quetta to Seistan”. 14. I am quite unable to understand either the force of this logic or the consistency of this conduct. The cautious and, in its motive, praiseworthy abstention of the Government of India from displaying any interest in Seistan, did not for one moment affect the designs, or retard the advance of Bussia in that direction. Russian news-writers were firmly established in the district before anything more than a casual visit had been paid by a British officer. While members of the Government of India w T ere writing notes to show that, if even a caravan route were opened from Quetta in the direction of Seistan, the Prussians would extend their trans-Caspian Railway southwards, the latter were already at work, laying their rails from Merv to the Kushk post, and preparing the plant for an ultimate extension to Herat. Sir M. Durand, in a paragraph of his recent despatch, has exposed the hollowness of this plea; and I venture to hope that it may not figure again in our reasoning. 15. Similarly, I am unable to comprehend how—the trade route having been deliberately opened—any activity in developing it can either be premature, or can possibly prevent or postpone hopes which the trade route itself has been called into existence to realise, and which, without it, would have had no being. Either the Nushki-Seistan trade route is a bona-fide enterprise, upon which we have designedly embarked, in the main, because of its commercial possibilities, but also not without an eye to the extreme political importance of Seistan; or it is a fortuitous and foolish experiment, not likely or intended to succeed. In the latter case let us be wise and drop it. la the former let us be honest, and make the best job of it that we can. 16. I have no hesitation in recommending the last named course: and I do so, not because I am carried away by the gratifying, though modest, achieve ments of the new trade route up to date, nor because I contemplate for it an early and brilliant success. On the contrary I regard the obstacles and difficul ties as considerable; and, knowing the traditional conservatism of the East, I recognise that commerce will not readily be diverted into a new, and, at first sight, somewhat unattractive channel. But I urge a strenuous continuation of the venture, with an eye to a twofold contingency, political and commercial, in the future. 17. In the first place if we do not continue to show an active interest in Seistan, Russia will. If we do not give the impression there of preponderant[ ‘ ] Russian ^ &amp;&amp; JR o,^ fiS cordons or otherwise the Nushki-Se^an tia ^ ^ r the single access of the ADDa^ gimilal , tactics ^ If we do no &gt; and tliis it nill ic easy ^ ^ j obvious method is to block desire Russia L “g to the future of Northern Khorasan, which Ts inevitably destined to pass under Russian control it should be our obiect to draw the line of demarcation between the Russian an d the British spheres at the point hest suited to our interests, and not to hm-s. I’he home districts of 1 ' - Turbat-i-Haidari, 80 miles south of Meshed. They will lihorasan end with Turbat-i doubtless follow the fortunes of the capital. 18. South of this district comes that of Kain already possessing a semi-independent chiefship, which might very well be retained as a buffer between the opposing spheres. Seistan should, for all the reasons given, he included in the British sphere of interest. It is no exaggeration to say that we cannot afford to see it excluded. 19. Secondly, a study of the history and features of Seistan, no less than of all modern reports upon it, leads to the conclusion that the futuie of that country will depend, as did its past, upon the proper employment of the immense w T ater-supply from the Helmand that now runs riot and goes to waste in vast lagoons, and reed-beds, and swamps. The greater part of Seistan is, during several months in the year, under inundation. Captain Sykes, in one of his letters, has estimated its present population at 60,000. In another, he has said that, under a proper system of irrigation, the land would support “ perhaps a tenfold population ”. In a third he has said that, if the Helmand were properly controlled, the population might rise to a million or more. It is clear, therefore, that the future of Seistan will lie with those who control the entire course of the Helmand. It should he in their power to turn the desert into a garden, and to make the wilderness blossom like a rose. 20. Now it can hardly he doubted that a day will come, when, in response to an external challenge, Great Britain will be obliged to advance to Kandahar. So fully is this probability admitted, that the arrangements for the advance, including the rails, the mobilisation camp, and the water-supply at Chaman have already been made. When Kandahar is re-occupied, the valley of the Helmand will he occupied with it. Then will come the time, when the channel and the valley of that river, now running parallel to the British border, though at no great distance from it, having passed under British control, the regenera tion of Seistan will for the first time become practicable, and it will he possible to revive its former fame as one of the granaries of that part of Asia. No wise man can be anxious to precipitate or even to hasten that consummation. But on the other hand no wisdom in the world can greatly retard it; and when the horn strikes, it would seem to me to he as well that Seistan should he waiting ItXwtfe “ ‘he regen!

Worn, whose imagination was at iliat time suffn^rl wiin Brr’K S sri t=S 3 authonties as a most valuable adjunct to the defences of India and as deserving of the utmost encouragement”. Sir H. Wolff’s proposals did not make much advance, but were reiterated by him in despatches to the Foreign Office dated July 2oth, and August 19th, 1890. Unfortunately in these, as' in his orMna! despatch of February 19th, 1889, Sir II. Wolff rested Ins defence of the d^t? extremely contentious and entirely unacceptable grounds. He advocated it for two reasons: as a menace to the Trans-Caspian Railway of Russia and as the saving of a long land march in the event of our desiring to take the offensive against that Power. This line of argument was completely riddled in a Memorandum, dated October 2nd, 1890, by General Brackenburyf at that time Head of the Intelligence Department at home. He pointed out that a single line to a remote corner of Persia could not counterbalance the position of Russia m that country, would not help us in the least on the Afghan border oi m Afgnan-Tiirkistan, and would be of no use for assuming the offensive. He concluded by saying—“ By far the more important task is, not the con struction of a new line into Seistan, but the consolidation of our power there by bringing the fromier tribes under our influence, and by developing Bain- chistan and converting it into a fertile base of operations. When this has been done, it will be time to push forward into Persia”. . 23 * General Brackenbury’s criticism was destructive of the proposal viewed as an offensive and strategical scheme. But a corresponding flaw in bis own argument was at once pointed out by Lord Salisbury, who noted that the real object of a Seistan railway would be not to attack Bussia in Northern Persia, but to saie Southern Persia from falling into her grasp, which could be done either by a line from Quetta, or, as be would himself prefer, by a line from the sea. 24. General Brackenbury’s criticism was sent out to the Government of India, and was thus noted upon by Sir G. Chesney on January 13th, 1891— “ The railway can only be regarded as a work of military precaution. Prom this point of* view it appears to me that the time cannot be far distant when it will be deemed necessary. Still more important is a railway from the Persian Gulf north to Seistan; &gt; but the connecting link between this line and the Quetta railway system will also be found necessary”. # 25. A little later Sir H. Brackenbury, now Military Member in India, again noted upon the scheme; and it is interesting to read his remarks in the light of. bis former opinion. He now explained (April 27th, 1891) that he had only objected to a Seistan railway so long as the§ Russian railway did not extend south of the Trans-Caspian line, and because to construct a railway to Seistan would compel her to make extensions. “ But if circumstances should change, and if Russia should take the lead in making railways southward, then it may become necessary for us to follow her lead. We ought to he able to keep pace with her ”.- ^ — srssz 26 India [ 8 I These conditions had not yet been realised, and the Government of invbv cuuu.lv * 4 - 1 , onTiPinpi. The miestion of a deekled to proceed no further with the scheme The question of a more ^“utherlv ine from the sea was at the same tune considered in connection with Sir E Sandeman’s proposals to take over Kej and Panjgur-a project which was revived in lSQd by his accessor. Sir J. Browne. On both occasions, how- ^erTas again at a later date), the proposal to assume administrative respon- sMitv for Makran was negatived by the Government of India and with it the idea of a Makran railway froin the sea to Seistan was dropped also. Since then the question has not been revived. . 27 It will he clear from the ahoye narrative, firstly, that the idea of a Seistan railway does not appear to have ever been considered by the Govern ment of India from the only point of view in which, m my opinion it ought to be regarded, viz., as a protective, and not an offensive, measure. The reason perhaps°is that, at that time, Russia had not given such unmistakable evidence of her intention to move southward from Meshed, and to draw Seistan within the radius of her political influence. The railway was accordingly^ discussed and condemned, as a means of attacking Russia in hoi them Rersia, not as a means of keeping Russia out of Southern Persia. Moreover at that time, the Quetta-Seistan trade route not having yet been opened, the possible commer cial value of the line was not taken into account at all. Secondly, it will bo noticed that the conditions postulated by Sir H. Brackenbury m London as precedent to any idea of railway construction in this quarter have since been realised. Baluchistan is rapidly being developed; the frontier tribes have passed com pletely under our control; a permanent line of communication with Seistan has been opened; while the very conditions which he said, when in India, might compel a change of attitude on our part— viz., Russian initiative in the process ; of southerly extension from her existing railway system—have been fulfilled by the construction on her part, without provocation or incentive from us, of the Merv-Kushk line. It is clear, therefore, that the question stands on a different footing from any that it has previously occupied ; and that the facts and arguments which weighed with our predecessors are inapplicable to the present situation. 28. As regards the physical and engineering difficulties by which such a line might he confronted, I may cite the following opinion from the report in, 1897 of Lieutenant Webb Ware: “ No one who has traversed this country can fail to he struck with the marvellous facilities which the country between Nusliki and Seistan offers for the construction of a railway. Scarcely a single material obstacle exists to bar the road j throughout the gradient is exceedingly gentle ; hands of sand can as a rule he avoided; of fuel there is an abundance ; while not a bridge of more than one span, or engineering work of any ma°*nitude , » requisite. Addfid to this tho mineral wealth of the Koh-i-Sultan and the hms to the west, at present lying untouched, is so considerable as in itself to offer very great inducements to railway enterprise; Such a railway would place the trade of Eastern Persia and Seistan at our feet, unlock such Central Asian markets as are now closed, give us a preponderating influence in Eastern Persia and opened to India the rich grain fields of Seistan * 1 r and fuel are clncCTnef^Hfe f u S ° ^ a8 S radients &gt; water-crossings, across the 400 route, and in the problem of Ze sh^^ds. bXS fe ^ been overcome by Russia though rvnW ^ ^ 4 . 0111 or tj3ese difficulties have large permanent staff, upon her^Trans^Casrifvn -R e ^P ense3 tjpd with the aid of a the°assistance of a settle^populat^o^anTth^a^vnlT^* S &gt; h ^ had &gt; moreover, sites along the railway line CeZ X / 6 ° f numerous inhabitedinasmuch as it would not he a line of connection between important centres of population, industry or arms, but would, so to speak, end in the air. If it stopped at the Anglo-Persian border, it would still be 90 miles distant from Nasirabad, the capital of Seistan. The chances of prolongation to the latter would appear to be problematical in view of the engagements against the intro duction of railways, which Persia has allowed to he imposed upon her by Russia The question of the military protection of the line, if constructed, is one upon which expert opinion would he required to pronounce; although, in the yearlv increasing tranquillity of the districts which it would traverse, I do not conceive that any serious difficulty would thereby be caused. j £?.y erni ? ent have in the accompanying despatch suggest- ed the desirability, of coming to an understanding with Russia concerning spheres ot interest in Persia, which would leave Seistan within the British zone In such a .case there might be no necessity, at any rate for the present, for a Quetta-Seistan railway. We could then devote ourselves to the diligent promo tion of the resuscitated caravan route, and look forward to the day when the Helmand being in our hands, we might convert Seistan into a flourishing out post on the flanks of British India, that would call for railway connection with the lines and resources of the interior. 31. Even in the event of such an understanding being declared impracti cable, while I hold firmly to the opinion that we should then be bound to adopt such measures for the protection of Southern Persia and of our interests in that quarter as we might deem desirable, and while I concur with Lord Salisbury in thinking that a Quetta-Seistan railway might be found to be one of these I am. yet in favour of consolidating our position in the interim, of fostering the incipient trade, of acquiring further information about the tracts to be traversed, and of familiarising the Perso-Baluch border lands, and Seistan in particular, with our presence and influence, before we decide upon such a forward move. It would at any time be a comparatively easy task to connect Quetta by railroad with Nushki (90 miles); and such an extension would afford no inconsiderable relief to the Persian caravans, who now have to proceed with their camels to Quetta, where there is no camel-grazing and, where the prices for fodder are high, instead of returning at once, after a few days’ rest, from Nushki. But I should like to see Nushki also developed, as I believe it is likely to be, by an interval of settled British administration, and by the measures which I am recommending in connection with the trade route, before I advocate even this advance. In a few years* time we shall be in a better position to pronounce upon ideas, the execution of which would for the present he somewhat in the nature of an experiment. September 1899. OT TRZON.I propose, in this Mmute, to examine the present aspect of the Seistan question m relation to our general policy towards Persia, and to the attitude of Kussia m Persia. In my book on Persia, I wrote a chapter on Seistan (Yol. I bhap. lA) which contained as full an account of that district, its history’ inhabitants, features, and commercial and political significance, as was then (1892) procurable. I also discussed the political ambitions of Russia in con- with Seistan (Vol. I, pages 201, 216-218, 235-244; Yol. II, pages 597- 598, 60o), and the question of a possible Seistan Railway from India in the future (Yol I, pages 237-244, 628-629). I ventured further to make certain recommendations, namely,^that we should establish Consular or other represent ation {a) at Yezd, {b) at Kerman, (c) in Seistan, (&lt;i) at Bunder Abbas; (e) that the Kerman-Meshed trade route should be improved; (/) that a British trade route should be opened from Quetta to Seistan; (g) that the question of railway extension in the direction of Seistan should be considered. Of these recommendations, I am glad to say that, during the interval that has since elapsed, (&lt;*), (5), (c), (e) and (f) have already been carried into execution. In the despatch with which this Minute is enclosed, (c?) is recommended by the Government of India. I propose shortly to discuss the present aspect of {g). The references which have been given will dispense me from recapitulating the elementary facts about Seistan; and I may commence with an account of what has happened during the past 7 years, leading up to a description of the status quo, 2. Seistan was in 1892 a beluk or sub-division of the district of Kain (capital Birjand) which is a part of the province of Khorasan (capital Meshed). The Government of Kain has for long been in the hereditary possession of a powerful family of Arab origin, whose head bears the title of Amir of Kain, and who, until the centralising tendencies of recent years, exercised an authority almost independent of that of the Shah. Mir Alam Khan, who had filled the post for over a quarter of a century, died in 1891. Eor reasons into which it is not necessary to enter, the younger of his two sons, Ismail Khan, known as the Shaukat-ul-Mulk (now about 50 years of age), succeeded him as Governor of Kain at Birjand. The elder son, Ali Akbar Khan, known as the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, became Governor of Tabbas and Seistan,—posts which he only retains by the process, familiar in Persia, of the annual payment of a large sum in cash to the Shah. The third son, Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, now just grown up, was made Sartip or Commandant of the Kain forces. The Shaukat- ul-Mulk and he have generally, but perhaps erroneously, been believed to incline towards Russia, whose aim has been to get Seistan, now to some extent separated from Kain, re-incorporated in it, and absorbed as an ordinary administrative district in the province of Khorasan. Such an amalgamation would emphasize the dependence of Seistan upon Meshed, from which it is now in some measure separate. 3. Meanwhile the elder brother, or Hashmat-ul-Mulk, has not himself resided in Seistan, but has deputed one of his sons, Mir Masum Khan, a fat and lethargic youth of about 18, to act as Deputy Governor at Nasirabad, under the tutelage of his mother, a lady with considerable powers of intrigue. This son is supposed to intrigue with the uncle at Birjand and is not on the best of terms with his father, who in 1898 sent an elder son, named Muhammad Reza Khan, to supersede him as Deputy Governor. Upon Mir Masum Khan declin ing to go, the quarrel was patched up ; and he still acts for his father in Seistan. Thus the local situation is that of Russia endeavouring to increase her hold uponL 2 ] , \ ~ o fpw weel^s asro, a special mission con- the ruler of Earn (to whom s i &gt; ^ ru ler of Kain endeayouring to veying presents valued at f MOO), an^t oust his brot er an o es British Consul-General at Meshed (in 4. Since the ap^tmeutM ^ ^ tment) in 1889&gt; _ geistan, which i 8 consequence of a s r- h - hns been frequently visited and reported u n pont d Mfeh offices either from India or from Meshed. The IWhle G. Napier visited H in 1892-93. Colonel Yate made a tour thither m 1891 and strongly Zed the appointment of a British Indian representative m Seistan, to balance tiie Russian native a-ent, whom he found exercising considerable influence. He enlaro-ed upon the wheat-producing capabilities of Seistan, the cheapness 5 grain there as compared with the dearness outside the advantage of export, ing the surplus supply to Quetta, the utility of a postal service from Chamau Vid Seistau to Meshed, in place of the Kandahar-Herat line; and he recom mended the construction of a line of wells and the planting of levy posts from Nushki to the Seistan border, so as to open a new caravan route tor Indo- Persian trade. His report was shown to the Shah, who agreed with Colonel Yate’s description of the political situation in Seistan, and, in so fai as they concerned Persia, with his recommendations. The Government of India were, however, at that time under the impression, which has since been abandoned, that anv evidence of British interest in Seistan or in Eastern Persia would merely bring down the Russians (who have come down without it), and would tempt them to extend their railway southwards (which they have since done independently of any British move). Accordingly Colonel Tate’s proposals were rejected. 5. Two years later Captain McMahon, who had been employed upon the demarcation of the Baluch-Afghan boundary (in pursuance of the Durand Agree ment of 1893), submitted a memorandum to the Government of India (dated June 21st, 1896), in which he strongly recommended the opening of the route which had been negatived in 1891, and the adoption of proper measures for its protection, and for the exercise of political authority up to the Persian border. The Government of India accepted these proposals, and submitted them to the Secretary of State in a despatch, dated September 16th, ] 896. The latter replied on October 23rd, giving his sanction, and observing that—“ In the interest of the trade between India and Persia, it seems to me very desirable to further its development by this route”. In the ensuing month Lieutenant Webb Ware was appointed Political Officer at Chageh, and was instructed to establish levy posts, and to take other steps for the prompt execution of the new scheme. 6. This officer started upon his first visit to Seistan in Januarv and returned m June 1897. He found Russian influence much in evidence in Seistan, wliere fie pleaded for the early installation of a British Agent. With regard irn] 1 ? ? onimercia ! possibilities of Seistan, he reported that “ Seistan’s staple wpt-g in ^ lam ’ § u . (clarified butter) and wool.

There were wanted however, better arrangement for water-supply, more godowns, and superior provision for storing fodder. The road was pronounced not yet suitable for merchants, travellers, or pilgrims, unaccustomed to rough travelling. Never theless the journey from Meshed to Quetta—62 marches or 1,090 miles was performed by Maula Bakhsh and his caravan in 65 days. Including the average number of halts, wz., 10, he pointed out that the normal duration of the journey i.e . 9 72 days, would yet be shorter than the 75—90 days usually occupied in traversing the alternative route, 966 miles long, between Meshed and Bunder Abbas. 9. In the same year, 1898, Lieutenant Webb Ware submitted his first Annual Report, which, in spite of the obstructive measures adopted by the Russian officers on the pretext of plague in Khorasan, recorded a gratifying advance. In an appendix on Nushki trade, he pointed out that the route was growing in favour, and that out of nothing had been created a trade, which had risen from 1-| lakhs in 1896 to Bs. 5,90,000 in 1897. The main impediments were the total lack of supplies, other than those specially imported, on the road between Nushki and the Seistan frontier, and the illegal extortion of the Persian toll-collectors (many of them in Russian pay) in Persian terri tory. Notwithstanding, he thought that the Quetta-Seistan route would even tually beat the Bunder Abbas route to Meshed, because merchandise carried by the latter required to change hands several times in transit, because a longer time was required for the journey thereby, and because the road was less secure than one running uninterruptedly through British territory. 10. In the present year, the same officer’s second Annual Report testifies to a continued improvement both in the amenities of the route, and in the trade returns, which have increased by Rs. 1,38,000 since 1897. A new bazar, containing 126 shops, has been laid out at Nushki, which has developed from a petty group of daub and wattle huts into a smalltown; and which, now that the Nushki district has been (in the summer of 1899) permanently taken over by the Government of India, is certain of a prosperous future. Through out the past year a weekly dak has been maintained from Quetta to the Seistan frontier, in correspondence with a bi-weekly Persian dak from thence via Nasirabad and Birjand to Meshed. Alterations and short cuts in the route have reduced the distance from Nushki to Meshed to 951 miles, as compared with 966 miles from Bunder Abbas to the same destination. 11. An independent light has been thrown upon Seistan in the same period by the visit of Captain Sykes, who was despatched thither as Consul at the end of 1898 in consequence of the appointment of a Russian Consul to Nasirabad. Captain Sykes, who has for some time been Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, and who has been greatly interested in the rival Bunder Abbas- Kerman-Meshed trade route, arrived in Seistan in January 1899, with pre possessions already so strongly formed in favour of the older route, and against the new competitor, that before he had been there a week, he pronounced against the permanent appointment of a Political Officer to Seistan, and in[ 4 ] n i • vofnvn fo Tverman.

In subsequent letters, Captain Sykes reiterated Ms opinions as to the superiority in respect of water, camel-grazing and sup- Dlies of the Bunder Abhas route; but so far receded from his original attitude as to admit that there was a great opening on the Indian route for imports of tea and indigo, and that on political grounds its opening was important, adding, “ The larger the parties that visit Seistan and the more frequently they appear, the greater the political effect will he On February 14th, he explained “ how necessary it is to provide the funds, by the careful expendituie of which Seistan may he brought nearer to India , , and urged that it is of paiamount import* ance to take advantage of the proximity of our frontiers and not to allow Russian trade and influence to be pushed to our very door On April J 8th, while adhering to his views about the superiority of the Bunder Abbas road over the Indian route, he nevertheless remarked that “ the Seistanis generally, and the Baluchis in particular, all look towards the East and South, while their local commerce is now mainly carried on with Quetta ”, and that “ the revival of the Seistan-Quetta route, the buildings erected along it and the other proofs of British activity, have helped to increase our prestige He now advocated placiug a smart Muhammadan native agent in Seistan “to supervise the post which I earnestly hope will he made permanent” ; and in a later letter, on May 11th, he urged {t the establishment of an Indian Post Office at Birjand, as well as in Seistan, with a competent news-writer for each district which “modest scheme should he sanctioned aud carried out without delay In the last letter received from him, dated June 1st, Captain Sykes expressed his final opinion as adverse to the appointment of a British Consul for Kain and Seistan, unless a Russian Consul were sent (in which case it would become obligatory). It will he seen, therefore, from a synopsis of Captain Sykes’s reports, that, while he remains unfavourable to the prospects of the Quetta-Seistan route, as compared with the old trans-Persian road, he has come round to ’the opinion, which no previous traveller in Seistan has questioned, that it is essential that British interests, commercial and political, should be sustained m that quarter by an energetic and liberal maintenance of the line of connec- fnr n tl,Tnll nd t la ’ Y that ’ f0r th f- ir su PP° rt in Seistai i itself, it will be sufficient tor the present unless a more active course be imposed by Russian initiative to p^ u ( ! n ' lan native agents.

H h M Ve ’ ^ un ® 0Ilscl 1 0U f ^consistency, affected to repudiate. I have already cited the reply returned to Colonel Yate in 1894.

I am quite unable to understand either the force of this hmc or the consistency of this conduct. The cautious and, in its motive, praiseworthy abstention of the Government of India from displaying any interest in Seistan did not for one moment affect the designs, or retard the advance of Russia in that direction. Russian news-writers were firmly established in the district betore anything more than a casual visit had been paid by a British officer. W hue members of the Government of India were writing notes to show that if even a caravan route were opened from Quetta in the direction of Seistan, the Kussians would extend their trans-Caspian Railway southwards, the latter were, already at work, laying their rails from Merv to the Kushk *post and preparing the plant for an ultimate extension to Herat. Sir M. Durand* in a paragraph of his recent despatch, has exposed the hollowness of this plea, and I venture to hope that it may not figure again in our reasoning. 15. . Similarly, I am unable to comprehend how—the trade route having been deliberately opened—any activity in developing it can either be premature, or can possibly prevent or postpone hopes which the trade route itself has* been called into existence to realise, and which, without it, would have had no being. Either the Nushki-Seistan trade route is a bovd-fide enterprise, upon which we have designedly embarked, in the main, because of its commercial possibilities, but also not without an eye to the extreme political importance of Seistan; or it is a fortuitous and foolish experiment, not likely or intended to succeed. In the latter case let us be wise and drop it. In the former let us be honest, and make the best job of it that we can. 16. I have no hesitation in recommending the last named course: and I do so, not because I am carried away by the gratifying, though modest, achieve ments of the new trade route up to date, nor because I contemplate for it an early and brilliant success. On the contrary I regard the obstacles and difficul ties as considerable; and, knowing the traditional conservatism of the East, I recognise that commerce will not readily he diverted into a new, and, at first sight, somewhat unattractive channel. But I urge a strenuous continuation of the venture, with an eye to a twofold contingency, political and commercial, in the future. 17. In the first place if we do not continue to show an active interest in Seistan, Russia will. If we do not give the impression there of preponderant A*[ 6 ] iilumc, Emm 3u“e kS, Wre will ouljSuS isr sr- K STi and this it will be easy for o p ers i an Gulf, the obvious method is to block desire Bussia to advance to t] future of Northern Khorasan, the most direct o her paths Looking ;t shollld be our which is inevitably destine P , t en t ] le Russian and the British spheres object to draw the line InTnot to hers.

IncludTd in the British sphere of interest. It is no exaggeration to say that we cannot afford to see it excluded. 19 Secondly, a study of the history and features of Seistan no less than of all modern reports upon it, leads to the conclusion that the future of that country will depend, as did its past, upon the proper employment of the immense water-supply from the Helmand that now runs not and goes to waste in vast lagoons, and reed-heds, and swamps. The greater part of Seistan is, during several months in the year, under inundation. Captain Sykes, m one of his letters, has estimated its present population at 60,000. In another, he has said that under a proper system of irrigation, the land would support “ perhaps a tenfold population ” In a third be has said that, if the Helmand were properly controlled, the population might rise to a million or more. It is clear, therefore, that the future of Seistan will lie with those who control tlm entire course of the Helmand. It should be in their power to turn the desert into a garden, and to make the wilderness blossom like a rose. 20. Now it can hardly be doubted that a day will come, when, in response to an external challenge, Great Hritain will he obliged to advance to Kandahar. So fully is this probability admitted, that the arrangements for the advance, including the rails, the mobilisation camp, and the water-supply at Chaman have already been made. When Kandahar is re-occupied, the valley of the Helmand will he occupied with it. Then will come the time, when the channel and the valley of that river, now running parallel to the British border, though at no great distance from it, having passed under British control, the regenera tion of Seistan will for the first time become practicable, and it will he possible to revive its former fame as one of the granaries of that part of Asia. No wise man can he anxious to precipitate or even to hasten that consummation. But on the other hand no wisdom in the world can greatly retard it; and when the hour strikes, it would seem to me to he as well that Seistan should he waiting to be regenerated by us, instead of having already been absorbed in the regen erative embraces of others. 21. Bor these reasons, I recommend that in the intervening years, the Government of India should continue, by constant, hut unpretentious, activity m fostering the trade route, in providing for its security, and in reducing its iscomforts, and by a steady assertion of British authority up to the borders of eis an and of British influence within it,—to build up an interest in Seistan wvi \i S - ia i . S T t ^ or an area an d a market of so much potential value. With this object I urge that we should he willing to spend a little money-it at -i? le m0st ^ 0 . 0nl y a f ew thousand pounds—upon a venture that eoutmrv toPp 81 ^’ Were doomed to failure, but that appears, on the contrary, to he attended with reasonable hopes of success. connection WeXTndir'Ld Seisten^^Thifo q T° f a , P ° SSi r le rail jyfrom the neighbourhood of Quetta via Nushki, not to Seistan, hut to Safar on tlie Helmand. Ihis proposal was put forward, without any reference to Persia tor strategical reasons, namely, in order to prevent, at any future period, a Russian advance upon Kandahar. It is interesting to me to learn from a study oi the papers, what I did not know before, viz., that five years later, when 1 was travelling in.Persiaand was first writing about this question, it had iust been raised both in India and in Persia by a report from Colonel Bell, at that time head of the Intelligence Department in India, who in the autumn of 1888 marched from India by Kharan and Mashkel to Seistan, and strongly recommended the construction of a railway, and a lease in perpetuity of Seistan fiom the Persian Government, with a view to the grant of a great irrigation concession to Beuter or to some other Company. The suggestion was eagerly taken up by Sir H. D. Wolff, whose imagination was at that time suffused with halcyon dreams of a regeneration of Persia by universal railways; and was recommended by him both to the Government of India and to Lord Salisbury. Lord Lansdowne’s Government in a telegram, dated January 20th, 1889, said that “ Railway extension through Baluchistan was regarded by the military authorities as a most valuable adjunct to the defences of India and as deserving of the utmost encouragement”. Sir H. Wolff’s proposals did not make much advance, but were reiterated by him in despatches to the Foreign Office, dated July 25th, and August 19th, 1890. Unfortunately in these, as in his original despatch of February 19th, 1889, Sir H. Wolff rested his defence of the scheme upon extremely contentious and entirely unacceptable grounds. He advocated it for two reasons : as a menace to the Trans-Caspian Railway of Russia, and as the saving of a long land march in the event of our desiring to take the offensive against that Power. This line of argument was completely riddled in a Memorandum, dated October 2nd, 1890, by General Brackenbury, at that time Head of the Intelligence Department at home. He pointed out that a single line to a remote corner of Persia could not counterbalance the position of Russia in that country, would not help us in the least on the Afghan border or in Afghan-Turkistan, and would be of no use for assuming the offensive. He concluded by saying—“ By far the more important task is, not the con struction of a new line into Seistan, but the consolidation of our power there by bringing the frontier tribes under our influence, and by developing Balu chistan and converting it into a fertile base of operations. When this has been done, it will be time to push forward into Persia”. 23. General Brackenbury’s criticism was destructive of the proposal viewed as an offensive and strategical scheme. But a corresponding flaw in his own argument was at once pointed out by Lord Salisbury, who noted that the real object of a Seistan railway would be not to attack Russia in Northern Persia, but to save Southern Persia from falling into her grasp, which could be done either by a line from Quetta, or, as he would himself prefer, by a line from the sea. 24. General Brackenbury’s criticism was sent out to the Government of India, and was thus noted upon by Sir G. Chesney on January 13th, 1891—- « The railway can only be regarded as a work of military precaution. From this point of view it appears to me that the time cannot be far distant when it will be deemed necessary. Still more important is a railway from the Persian Gulf north to Seistan; but the connecting link between this line and the Quetta railway system will also be found necessary”. 25. A little later Sir H. Brackenbury, now Military Member in India, again noted upon the scheme; and it is interesting to read his remarks in the light of his former opinion. He now explained (April 27th, 1891) that he had only objected to a Seistan railway so long as the| Russian railway did not extend south of the Trans-Caspian line, and because to construct a railway to Seistan would compel her to make extensions. “ But if circumstances should change, and if Russia should take the lead in making railways southward, then it may become necessary for us to follow her lead. M e ought to be able to keep pace with her ”,[ 8 ] 26 These conditions had not yet been realised, and the Government of India decided to proceed no further with the scheme The questmn of a more southerly line from the sea was at the same time considered in connection w lt h Sir It Lndeman’s proposals to take over Kej and Patggur-a project which was revived in 1894 by his successor, Sir J. Browne. On both occasions, how- ever fas again at a later date), the proposal to assume administrative respon sibility for Makran was negatived by the Government of India, and with it the idea of a Makran railway from the sea to Seistan was dropped also. Since then the question has not been revived. 27. It will he clear from the above narrative, firstly, that the idea of a Seistan railway does not appear to have ever been considered by the Govern ment of India from the only point of view in which, in my opinion, it ought to be regarded, viz.&gt; as a protective, and not an offensive, measuie. I he reason perhaps D is that, at that time, Russia had not given such unmistakable evidence of her intention to move southward from Meshed, and to draw Seistan within the radius of her political influence. The rail way was accordingly discussed and condemned, as a means of attacking Russia in Northern Persia, not as a means of keeping Russia out of Southern Persia. Moreover at that time, the Quetta-Seistan trade route not having yet been opened, the possible commer cial value of the line was not taken into account at all. Secondly, it will be noticed that the conditions postulated by Sir H. Brackenbury in London as precedent to any idea of railway construction in this quarter have since been realised. Baluchistan is rapidly being developed; the frontier tribes have passed com pletely under our control; a permanent line of communication with Seistan has been opened; while the very conditions which he said, when in India, might compel a change of attitude on our part—Russian initiative in the process of southerly extension from her existing railway system—have been fulfilled by the construction on her part, without provocation or incentive from us, of the Merv-Kushk line. It is clear, therefore, that the question stands on a different footing from any that it has previously occupied; and that the facts and arguments which weighed with our predecessors are inapplicable to the present situation. 28. As regards the physical and enginpcring difficulties by which such a i'wvt , JC confronted, I may cite the following opinion from the report in 1897 of Lieutenant Webb Ware: “ No one who has traversed this country can fail to be struck with the marvellous facilities which the country between Ivushki and Seistan offers for the construction of a railway. Scarcely a single material obstacle exists to bar the road; throughout the gradient is elceedTnfly ffioUbridtTmrthr ™ Ie b6 of fuel ^ ^ aWndtS is requisite.

If it stopped at the Anglo-Bersian border, it would still he 90 miles distant from Nasirabad, the capital of Seistan. The chances of prolongation to the latter would appear to he problematical in view of the engagements against the intro duction of railways, which Persia has allowed to be imposed upon her by Russia. The question of the military protection of the line, if constructed, is one upon which expert opinion would he required to pronounce; although, in the yearly increasing tranquillity of the districts which it would traverse, I do not conceive that any serious difficulty would thereby be caused. 30. The Government of India have in the accompanying despatch suggest ed the desirability of coming to an understanding with Russia concerning spheres of interest in Persia, which would leave Seistan within the British zone. In such a case there might be no necessity, at any rate for the present, for a Quetta-Seistan railway. We could then devote ourselves to the diligent promo tion of the resuscitated caravan route, and look forward to the day, when, the Helmand being in our hands, we might convert Seistan into a flourishing out post on the flanks of British India, that would call for railway connection with the lines and resources of the interior. 31. Even in the event of such an understanding being declared impracti cable, while I hold firmly to the opinion that we should then be bound to adopt such measures for the protection of Southern Persia and of our interests in that quarter as we might deem desirable, and while I concur with Lord Salisbury in thinking that a Quetta-Seistan railway might be found to be one of these, I am yet in favour of consolidating our position in the interim, of fostering the incipient trade, of acquiring further information about the tracts to be traversed, and of familiarising the Perso-Baluch border lands, and Seistan in particular, with our presence and influence, before we decide upon such a forward move. It would at any time be a comparatively easy task to connect Quetta by railroad with Nushki (90 miles); and such an extension would afford no inconsiderable relief to. the Persian caravans, who now have to proceed with their camels to Quetta, where there is no camel-grazing and, where the prices for fodder are high, instead of returning at once, after a few days’ rest, from Nushki. But I should like to see Nushki also developed, as I believe it is likely to be, by an interval of settled British administration, and by the measures which I am recommending in connection with the trade route, before I advocate even this advance. In a few years’ time we shall be in a better position to pronounce upon ideas, the execution of which would for the present be somewhat in the nature of an experiment. September 4th 9 1899.

The cause of difference appears to be due to the latter laying claim to a share of the grain seized and confiscated by the former on the Nushki-Shorawak frontier. 3. With reference to paragraph 5 of my diary for the week ending 16th January 1900, the import of wheat into Nushki still continues. 4. Mahmud Khan, Mengal, who, as recently announced, has had to yield to the pressure brought to bear on him by his fellow-tribesmen, and allow grain Kafilas to pass to Nushki, is now levying a tax of Rs. 2 per camel on each camel, laden with grain, passing through the district under his control. 5. I am informed that Mahmud Khan is in receipt of a letter from Kan dahar to the effect that the question of the alignment followed by the Nushki- Shorawak frontier, between pillars 148 and 157, is now occupying the atten tion of His Highness the Amir, and that he may expect his instructions on this subject on or about Nauroz, viz., 19th March. 6. Two Levy sowars of the Killa Robat Thana, Levy establishment, have recently returned from Kirman, where they were sent on duty. They report that between Koh-i-Malik Siah and Kirman camel grazing and water is to he met with at every stage throughout, with the exception of one stage, said to he about 40 miles long, and that the road itself is for the most part level. Major Sykes and myself are making an effort to open direct trade com munication between Kirman and Quetta via Killa Robat. 7 . Midway between Mnshki Chah and Makak Karez, a distance of 51^ miles, a halting place has been made by sinking wells. The Baluch, who sank these wells for me, term the new halting place Wir Sahib Chah. The compli ment is of a somewhat doubtful nature, as to water the wells yield is distinctly bitter. The stages east and west of the new halting place are both over 20 miles. In accordance with my usual practice, I am subdividing each ot ie stages by wells. These wells will be ready in the course of the next few weeks. 8. The chief objections persistently urged against the Quetta-Nushki- Seistan trade route would appear summed up to be briefly as follows: (a) The length of the route as compared to that of the Bunder Abbas route. (b) The want of water and camel grazing throughout. The numerous belts of sand which are met with. (d) The arid character of the country traversed by the route. (e) The want of places where caravans can rest and recuperate.Writing from the extreme western extremity of the Baluch section of the route and after a iengthy inspection of it, I venture to submit that so far from the above being the case— ne auove uen-ig me (a) If the length of the re-aligned Quetta-Seistan route to Meshed be compared with that via Bunder Abbas, it will be found that the saving in mileage, in favour of the latter, is, approximately, 107 ucigt^ in xavuu.1 kjl xyy milesf lam of opinion that this figure can still further be reduced by 8 or 9 miles by making improvements, on my side of the Persian frontier, and by nearly 40 miles, beyond the Persian frontier, by running the direct route from Hurmak via the foot of the Olang Eoh range to Neh, etc., in place of via Girdi Talab and Seistan as at present A still further saving in mileage could naturally be effected by taking the route direct from Neh to Kirtaka, but as this would entail a passage through a strip of Afghan territory, it is unnecessary to consider it further. In spite of the attraction, in mileage offered by the Bunder Abbas route, it is significant to note that the aproximate average cost of the carriage of the same weigiit of goods from Meshed to Quetta by the Seistan-Nushki route was during the year 1898-99 no less than 4 karans less than in the case of goods sent via Bunder Abbas. (b) At every stage between Quetta and Killa Robat, with the possible exception of the Kishingi stage, llj miles north-east of Nushki there is water sufficient to supply the daily requirements of a thousand camels and the camelmen, accompanying me, who are naturally experts in the matter of camel grazing, state that having due regard to the season of the year the camel grazing is good. 6 0 W The “‘y s ®“ d K no 'S me * wil i h I s a belt near Yadgar Chah some 0 yards broad.

We might find an adequate reason for so doing in the fact that Your Lordship m your despatch of June 30th, 1899, enclosing a copy of a recent despatch to the Foreign Office from Sir M. Durand, Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, concerning the maintenance of our influence in Persia has directly invited an expression of the views of the Government of India upon this matter; and, while calling our attention to the desirability of improv ing the Political and Consular Service in that country, has at the same time stated your desire to be made acquainted with our opinions upon the remaining questions discussed by Sir M. Durand. But, in any case, we should have felt it our duty at an early date to address Your Lordship on the subject. Although the relations of Great Britain with Persia have for a period of exactly a century occupied a large, and perhaps at times a disproportionate, space upon the field of international diplomacy ; although during that time Great Britain has twice broken off diplomatic relations and has once been at war with Persia in vindication of British interests in or upon the borders of that country; and, although large sums of money have been throughout the present century and are still annually expended in the maintenance of those interests, both by Her Majesty’s Government and by the Government of India, we have not been able to discover in our records any clear definition of the principles upon which our policy towards the Persian kingdom is based, of the objects which it should keep in view, or of the scope and limits of the respective shares of responsibility, political and financial, which should be assumed by the two partners, viz., Her Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, who are jointly concerned in the defence of Anglo-Indian interests in the dominions of the Shah. 2. We feel that there is at the present time the greater need for such a discussion, because of the facts, which must be patent to all, that the Persian Government appears well nigh to have exhausted all power of recuperation or reform; and that the country, but feebly held together by any tie either of race, religion, or loyalty, is only saved from a fate to which it must otherwise have long ago succumbed, partly by a superficial vitality not infrequently seen in pDlitical organisms, especially in the East, even when in an advanced stage of decay, still more by the rival ambitions of the two great European Powers between whom its territories are placed, and who are the real arbiters of its[ 2 ] destiny.. These conditions have already displayed a durability in excess of anv a prion expectations, and they may yet continue for a while, in the absence oi any startling change of environment, to survive. But they cannot, in the nature of things, be permanent. A nation and a Government, such as the irersian, may tremble for long upon the verge of certain dissolution, from the absence of the particular impulse that is required to propel them over the rink. But in the last resort, and often by accident, the impetus is com municated, and the already shattered structure tumbles into irretrievable ruin. tlhnk that there are signs that such an issue, if not immediatelv impending m Persia, is drawing near. The rule of the present Shah is distinctlv and uniformly weaker than that of his predecessor. The dissolvent agencies at work in the Persian kingdom are more active and persistent. Meanwhile, the encroachments of Russian power are steadfastly pursued and are less veiled by any pretence of concealment. Other Governments and nationalities, either impelled by the. secret obligations of international sympathies, or attracted by a desire to share in the probable spoils, *are appearing upon the scene; and there is every reason to believe that, as in the case of the Ottoman Empire and of China, so also here, the property of the sick man, should no steps be taken in advance to prolong his existence, and should the end come before any testamentary dispositions have been made, is likely to be subject of bitter contention between the various parties who may demand to be included among his heirs. 4. We desire, therefore, not merely to examine, in response to Your Lordship’s invitation, the particular steps that may require to be taken for the maintenance or extension of British interests in Persia at the present juncture, but to survey a wider field, and, while there is yet time, to discuss how those interests should be definitely safeguarded in the future that seems to be imminent, and what part in the outlay or in the measures that may be necessitated for that end, should be assumed respectively by Her Majesty’s Government and by the Government of India. Sir M. Durand himself concludes his despatch by saying that “ the time has come for us to lay down a definite line of policy”. We concur in this opinion, but we interpret the obligation thus admitted in a broader sense than Her Majesty’s Minister has done ; and we think that no mere stop-gap measures, however useful they may individually be, will avail for the permanent protection of our position in Persia, unless a clear understanding be arrived at in advance as to what that position is and what it demands. 5. It may not be inappropriate to state, in the first place, what we conceive British, i.e., Anglo-Indian, interests in Persia to be. They are com mercial, political, strategical and telegraphic. The total annual value of British trade with Persia has been estimated by Sir M. Durand (and, from the calculations that we have made, we believe the estimate to be. below the mark) as approximately three and-a-half millions sterling; and while a great deal of this trade, particularly in the south and east, is with British India, yet the northern and western avenues of entry are devoted in the main to commercial connections with the British Isles. The total volume of Anglo-Persian trade continues, in spite of the difficulties encountered and the increasing insecurity in Persia, to rise and, under a more efficient and less venal regime, would probably attain to much larger dimensions. Similarly, although the experience of the past decade has not been encouraging to British mercantile investment in Persia, as the experience of the Tobacco Regie, the Persian Mining Rights Company, and other ventures, has shown, there is nevertheless a good deal of British capital sunk in various industrial undertakings in different parts of the country. 6. The political interests of Great Britain in Persia, although they date originally from a period before India had become a British interest at all, were, in their revival a century ago, in the main Indian in inception, and are still largely Indian in character. It would be unfair, however, at the present day tonf t i h» U i!f t0 « t ^ e w an c, eX0lusi T? ly . Indian compkxion. Ever since the first visit ot the late Shah to Europe, Persia has been drawn increasingly into the vortex of European politics. Neither Prance, Germany, Austria, Italy, Holland, nor -Belgium own possessions contiguous to the Persian dominions. Their commercial stake in the country is relatively small. Notwithstanding they find it to their interest to maintain, what are in some cases costly and extensive, diplomatic establishments at Tehran, and they occupy a minor, hut nevertheless a definite, position upon the local diplomatic stage. It is to be surmised, therefore, that, even liad British India not existed, or had it passed into other hands, the British (joyernment would nevertheless before now have been compelled to take an active political interest in Persian fortunes. Persia is in fact one of those countries which, whether or not they had fallen into the orbit of Western Powers, more vigorous than themselves, must inevitably have attracted the attention of Europe, partly from their increasing infirmity, hut still more from the opportunities suggested by their latent, though neglected, sources of strength. The two-fold British interest and responsibility here indicated have indeed been recognised by the system, now of long standing, under which the charges of the diplomatic establishment maintained by Her Majesty’s Govern ment at Tehran are shared between the Imperial and the Indian exchequers. That such a division of common interest has become necessary, that the politics of Tehran, which with one eye turned towards India looks with the other towards St. Petersburgh and Constantinople, are but one aspect of the eternal Eastern question, and that the control of British diplomacy at Tehran must therefore he vested in the hands of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, are propositions which 40 years ago were hotly contested by certain schools of thought, but that will not any longer be a matter of dispute. They serve to illustrate the Imperial, as distinct from the purely Indian, character of Anglo- Persian relations. 7. The strategical interests of Great Britain in Persia arise from conditions with which India is most intimately concerned. Long before the boundaries of British India had been extended to their present limits, or before Russia had become a great Central Asian Power, approaching or impinging at many points upon the Indian frontiers, the fortunes of Persia, though not at that time a coterminous country, had become a matter of vital concern to the British dominion in India. In the early years of the present century, when the ambi tions of France were the main source of apprehension, it was through Persia that a blow at British supremacy was expected to be struck, and that an inva sion of India was planned. The same idea has re-appeared at intervals since. Now that the boundaries of Afghanistan, which have been demarcated and guaranteed by Great Britain, march for many hundreds of miles with those of Persia; that Persian territory is also coterminous for hundreds of miles with Baluchistan, a State under a British Protectorate, and in large measure actually administered by the officers of the Government of India; and that the sea which washes the southern coasts of Persia is one in which, both from its proximity to the Indian Ocean and as a result of the exertions of the past century, Indian interests and influence have become supreme—it is clear that Persia has assumed a strategical importance, in relation to British India, which might not be serious, were the resources or the designs of that country itself alone to be considered; but which is indisputably great, when it is remembered that closely pressing upon Persia and upon Afghanistan is the ever-growing momentum of a Power whose interests in Asia are not always in accord with our own, and that the Persian Gulf is beginning to attract the interest of other and some times rival nations. These conditions, however, while they indicate the supreme concern which those who are responsible for the government of India cannot fail to feel in the fortunes of Persia, are nevertheless sufficiently obvious m their general application to render it unnecessary for us to point out their far more than local range, or to argue that they affect not merely the destinies of British dominion in India, but those of the British Empire. It is from this point of view that we hold strongly the opinion that Persia m its strategical, no less than in its political, aspect is not only an Indian, but is also an imperial,[ * ] r 4 Ss'sc it^riss “sii F ~j ^ »«&gt; - ■« overland connection with the East are ^ + 1 ^ r J, f tlle mam savjjaafe ssr^sf 2ft«?vSS? s .1444 4 ttri—irisS 1 S said to be equally British and Indian, since it is equally indispensable to the interests of both countries; but which also has an ulterior the inasmuch as the Trans-Persian wires, and the sub-marine cables by wMchtt^y are supplemented m the Persian Gulf, are largely utilised for the conveyance of messages between Great Britain and places lying beyond India notabIv the Australasian Colonies. From a calculation bashed 'upon tL ag«e ^ of the past five years we have ascertained that no less than 30 per cent of e total traffic is of this description. Nevertheless the cost, in so far as it is STthe Cme Exo”*’ eV ° 1VeS eSclW1 y the Indian, and not u 9 ' ,^ C Mf etl l e main 1 interests of Grea t Britain in Persia. It will be observ ed that the shares that may be claimed by the mother-country and by India m the sum total of those interests, have in the passage of time become so mterwoven and fused as to render the task of separating or distinguishing; them neither easy nor profitable. It may not be difficult, as we shall endeavour to argue later on, to distinguish between sources of expenditure which should more properly fall to the charge of the one or the other partner. But we maintain that enough has been said to prove that on the broad field of international policy Persia is not exclusively an Indian interest, but is emphatically an Imperial interest of Great Britain ; and that the latter should be prepared to exert her full strength for the defence of that interest, should it be jeopardised or impugned. 10. In discussing the manner in which it is desirable that these principles if accepted, should be carried into action, we are anxious at the outset to make our position, in one respect, perfectly clear. We have no desire to make an addition to the political or territorial responsibilities of India, for which we have not, under existing conditions, the means either in money or in men. We are not about to propose that there should be established any Protectorate, open or covert, over any part of the Shah’s dominions, that might compel us in the future to’ hold the country so protected by force of arms. We can conceive of circumstances that might some day tempt both the Indian and the Home Governments from this attitude of reserve, and that would in a case where the vital interests of the Empire were at stake, force us to consider a burden for which our shoulders are still unprepared. But for the present our ambitions are exclusively limited to making secure the interest which we have already built up, and still more to preventing it from being undermined or taken from us by others, with the result not only of a considerable accretion of strength to them, but of positive detriment to ourselves. We have, in fine, no desire to disturb the political status quo in Persia so long as it can be maintained. We prefer indeed, weak as it is, to invest it with such renewed vitality as may be found possible. But we press for an early decision and for early action, since, unless we bestir our selves, there is good reason for fearing that the already trembling balance may. ^ be disturbed by others to our disadvantage. 11 . We now proceed to draw a picture of the present state of British interests in Persia, as they present themselves to our eyes, and to examine the dangers by which they appear to be threatened. Sir M. Durand Las to a cer tain extent anticipated us in this task ; and in so far as he has touched upon the same ground as that whieU we propose to cover, we shall not recapitulate[ 6 ] be our duty to discuss the situation fvn™ +vT I aamtional detail; and it will those Indian interests, of which we are the coUiSglXns Parti ° Ulariy ° £ haveXted tto^e 1 ofPersS t to 1 be 0 fre liTX.f , Gov ®™ meIlt &gt; as weak as we geographical ^sittn irXX to he^ nei^Xtr Of ^ Powers whose territories adjoin her own, two m£v be ehmin^Lf f °^ f ° relSI1 discussion as being- thcmsplvoc ° ^ ellininate d from the present render their iXfent dec^ or 6 Streng f h ,° r vitalit y&gt; lil ' e, y Turkey and Afo-hanistan the latter nf wi • aB ° resslon to be feared. These are with re the 0 exc e ep U t;on 0 of e t r ha°t f poXn 'whTch Xdlr u^o'n‘l/caT te s itOTy ’ distinction, but not a difference, inasnruchX tSt 'rhas to XntentTa7d purposes been converted into a Russian lake. Russian territory also overlans ^e north-east corner of the Persian dominions. Great Britain enjoys a some what similar preponderance of influence on the south, by virtue of her hitherto challenged supremacy, both naval and commercial, in the Persian Gulf • while, owing to recent developments on the side of Baluchistan, her land territories also touch those of Persia upon the south-east. But there are these bioad differences between the two positions: firstly, that whereas the Russian territories that are limitrophe with Persia on the north are continuous either with those of European or with those of Asiatic Russia, the immense resources of both of which dominions can be brought by a skilfully designed system of railways, and deposited with little trouble and with no delay, upon tin; Persian frontier itself—the forces of Great Britain, if required for purposes either of menace or attack, would require to be conveyed by sea and would he separated by a great distance from their base; the land connection on the Perso-Baluch side being as yet too precarions and remote to admit of its being taken into senons consideration in the present context; secondly, that whereas the Russian land approaches upon the north are in her own exclusive possession, the maritime access of Great Britain on the south is equally open to any other Power possessing a naval marine. Hence the marked and inevitable distinction between the power of persuasion or menace possessed by Russia in the north as compared with that at the disposal of Great Britain in the south, the advantage enjoyed by the former being enhanced by the fact that the Persian capital and Court are situated in the northern or Russian and not in the southern or British zone of influence. 13.^ In these circumstances it is not surprising to read of the increasing and indisputable supremacy which Russia has established in Northern Persia, as described by Sir M. Durand. While not repeating his demonstration, we may supplement it by saying that, while we think that no efforts should be spared to safeguard so much as is left to us of the trade that enters the country by the Trebizond-Tabriz route, of the trade of Tehran, and of that of North- East Persia (concerning which it may be noted that the imports into Meshed from British India which in 1893-94 represented a value of £198,500 and in 1894-95 of £312,000, have in 1897-98 sunk to £130,000), and while as long as the capital remains at Tehran, which is also the centre of important British interests in the shape of the Telegraph administration and the Imperial Bank of Persia, it is essential that British influence there should be asserted on a scale as nearly as possible equivalent to that of Russia—we are yet of opinion that the advantages enjoyed by Russia in the field under discussion are so over whelming as to render any attempt to dispute or to shake her position there fruitless; and that our own energies can with greater wisdom and with superior chances of success be directed towards the protection and consolidation of theBritish sphere of influence in the centre and south, examination of this subject that we now turn. It is to a more critical tt-u ^ urai1 ^ ^ as i n hi s despatch drawn a line across Persia from Khanikm on the Turkish frontier on the west, through Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd and Kerman to Seistan and the Afghan frontier on the east, as indicating approximately the existing line of partition between the British and Russian spheres of influence both political and commercial in Persia. 15. Poliowing the same order from the west, we concur with what he has written about the importance of fostering the Baghdad trade route via Kerman shah to Tehran, British commerce by which approaches in value to £1,000,000 per annum. This is a route of peculiar value both to British and to Indian trade, and one upon which we should on no account forfeit the supremacy. We have no hesitation in recommending, with Sir M. Durand, the substitution of a British Vice-Consul at Kermanshah for the present native agent: although we think that the cost of the proposed appointment which lies outside of what may he called the more strictly Indian zone, and which will he subordinate to the Consulate-General at Tehran, should be home by Imperial and not by Indian revenues. 16. Whatever he the prospects of opening up, either by road or by railway (and concerning the latter we are sceptical), the country that lies northward of the Karun River, and that is inhabited by the Lurs and other nomad tribes, it is certain that British influence has obtained a material foothold in that corner of the Shah’s dominions, through which the Karun flows in its middle and lower course, and where the road now being constructed through the Bakhtiari country, by contract between the Bakhtiari Chiefs and Messrs. Lynch, should open an alternative and almost exclusively British door of commercial access to Ispahan. We do not express any opinion as to the ideas which Sir M. Durand has more than once put forward as to the desirability of raising a local irregular force under British officers from the tribes in this part of Persia. Such a scheme would appear to postulate a firmer and more permanent footing than we have as yet established in South-West Persia. Nevertheless we think that no opportunity should be lost of strengthening our influence with the Arab, Bakhtiari and Lur tribes—an effort to challenge which from a rival quarter appears likely before long to be made—and we concur in Sir M. Durand’s recommendations as to the desirability of establishing a Consulate on the Karun, reserving for a subsequent paragraph our opinion as to the proper incidence of the cost. 17. Continuing in an easterly direction, we have noticed from the recent Consular Report of Mr. J. R. Preece, Her Majesty’s Consul at Ispahan, that “ British trade in Ispahan has shown during the last two years, if not an absolute decrease, at all events no expansion whatever”, while great strides have been made in Russian importations, notably of glassware and hardware. We agree with Sir M. Durand in thinking that the British Consul should be raised in respect of title and pay to the same level as the recently arrived Russian representative, although, as this is a matter which mainly concerns the English Foreign Office, we are not clear that we are called upon to advise upon the subject. We cannot, however, too strongly emphasise our opinion that in any partition either of commercial or political spheres of influence in Persia, Ispahan, the old (and, if Persia should ultimately break up, possibly a future) capital, the seat of the Sefavi dynasty, the principal market of Central Persia, and (far more than Tehran) the focus of Persian nationality, must, on every ground, be included in the zone in which British interests are supreme. 18. We also concur with Sir M. Durand in thinking that British interests are most inadequately represented at Shiraz by the present native agent, who is a nonentity, without influence or power; and that the experiment of bringing the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who is also Consul-General for Ears, to reside[ V ] during the summer at the capital of the province, which is within his official area of jurisdiction, should be given a further trial. Colonel Wilson in 1895 and Colonel Meade in 1898 spent the summer months at Shiraz, hut were compelled to hire house accommodation at their own expense. If these visits are made recurrent, we are inclined to think that, as no suitable house appears to he open either to purchase or to rent, a site should he purchased and a house erected thereon. To this suggestion also we will revert. Shiraz is a place of considerable importance; and were it not for the great influence that has for long been exercised there by the officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, British interests must have suffered from the neglect to which they have hitherto been exposed. 19. The districts lying to. the east of Ispahan and Shiraz contain the important cities and trade-centres of Yezd and Kerman, connected by one of the principal postal and caravan tracks of Persia. Both of these towns and districts lie south of the natural line of division between Northern and Southern Persia; and in both British commercial and political influence has, in recent years, been actively vindicated. In September 1893, Mr. Pergusson, the Manager of the local branch of the Imperial Bank, was appointed unpaid Vice-Consul/ Sir M. Durand now suggests that a Vice-Consul, if appointed to Bunder Abbas, might pass his summer at Yezd, where it is no doubt intrinsi cally desirable that British commercial interests should be represented by some one not engaged in business or trade. We will for the moment reserve our comments upon this suggestion. At Kerman, which is the capital of an important province, and the seat of a Governor-General, the appointment of a British Consul, which was first sanctioned under exceptional circumstances in the case of Captain Sykes in 1891, has at frequent intervals since, the latest being our despatch of August 10th, 1898, been the subject of discussion between Her Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. The present position is this, that for 5 years the Government of India have expressed their willingness to contribute one-half of the cost of the Kerman Consulate up to a limit of Rs. 6,000 per annum. The views of the Foreign Office upon this proposal, which was communicated to it by Your Lordship on September 21st, 1898, have not yet been received by us. Sir M. Durand now proposes that this Consulate should be made permanent, and that possibly a native agent under its orders should he sent to Bampur. Before discussing these pro posals, we think it advisable to analyse the larger issues raised by the questions of Seistan and the Persian Gulf. 20. Concerning Seistan, its importance and the present position there, we refer Your Lordship to a Minute which has been written by the Viceroy, who has made a special study of the question, and which is enclosed with this despatch. The facts enumerated by him are, we think, sufficient to show that Seistan is, by reason of its geographical position in relation both to North Khorasan, to Western Afghanistan, to British Baluchistan, and to the Persian Gulf, a position of no small strategical importance. Seistan is the present meeting point of the advanced pioneers of British and Russian influence. Perhaps on the whole, owing to recent activity on our pait, the British position and chances are the more hopeful. It is essential in the future, for reasons which have been argued in the Viceroy’s Minute, that Seistan should he retained in the British zone. It is fortunately not too late to secure that consummation. The steps which should be taken with that object will be examined when ne formulate our final recommendations at the close of this despatch. 21. South of Seistan lies the still imperfectly known district of Persian Baluchistan. Every year this province is being brought into closer contact with British associations, partly from the visits of British officers, partly from the wide-spreading influence exercised by the Nushki-Seistan Trade route, still more from the close connections, political and racial, prevailing between the inhabitants of the two sides of the Perso-Baluch border—a condition of affairs which is likely to be confirmed by the inevitable increase of British influence in the dominions of the Khan of Kalat.[ 7 ] during the summer at the capital of the province, which is within his official area of jurisdiction, should be given a further trial.

To this suggestion also we will revert.

[ 8 ] 22 , Our inspection of the various sub-areas composing what we have ,_ as the Bntisn sphere has now brought us to the Persian Gulf-a subject which—no doubt from its more exclusively Indian aspect and hearing! has only been lightly touched upon by Sir M. Durand, hut upon which it is necessary that we should address Your Lordship at greater length. 23. The cte position in the Persian Gulf is that of a sea open to the flag of all nations, the northern shores and territorial waters of which are included in the dominions of Persia while its western and southern coasts are partially owned and partially claimed by Turkey, or are in the occupation of Arab tribes who have entered into treaty relationships of varying character, constituting a sort of veiled Protectorate, with Great Britain. The islands in the Gulf are owned either by Persia, or by Arab Chiefs (in the case of Bahrein under British protection); but upon one of the Persian Islands, viz., Kishm, Great Britain pos sesses a piece of land by virtue of an original grant from the Imam of Maskat, to whom the island once belonged. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf’ hut included in the same political system, are, on the northern shore of the Arabian Sea, the coasts of Persian Baluchistan, along which the overland wires of the Indo-European Telegraph Company run as far as Task, where a reserve of English territory exists under an agreement concluded in 1887 between the British and Persian Governments, and where a detachment of Indian troops, who had previously been stationed there between the years 1879 and 1887, was replaced in January 1898 in consequence of the murder of a British telegraph official and the disturbed state of Persian Baluchistan. A larger detachment was at the same time despatched to Charbar, near the eastern limits of the same province. On the southern and western coasts is the still independent kingdom or Sultanate of Oman (Maskat). 24. The de facto position upon the waters and on the shores of the Persian Gulf reflects a more positive British predominance than the preceding paragraph might indicate. In the early years of the present century, the slave trade was rampant in the Gulf, and the vessels of the Indian Marine were engaged in a long and arduous straggle with the Arab pirates who infested its southern coasts. This conflict which was conducted entirely by British agency and means, without any help from the Persian Government, resulted in the establish ment of treaty relations with the great majority of the Arab Chiefs, under which they bound themselves to observe perpetual peace and to refer all disputes to the British Resident at Bushire.. The. pax Britamnica, which has ever since, with rare exceptions, been maintained, is the issue of these arrange ments and is the exclusive work of this country. Of similar origin were the soundings of the channels and the surveys of the shores of the Persian Gulf, which the navigators of all nations ow~e to the labours of a long line of naval officers of the Indian service. Meanwhile, British trade has acquired almost a monopoly of the foreign commerce of the Gulf ports. Indian Buniajs from r Shikarpur ancLSind have settled in considerable numbers at Lmgah, Bunder 1 [ ^Abbas, BushirCand Bahrein. They frequently farm the customs The foreign f imports and exports pass through their hands.

It amounted to no less than 93 per cent both of the number and tonnage of the steamers engaged. P ,, -r 26 ,' J )unn S the kst thirty years the maintenance of the sub-marine cables of the Indo-European lelegraph Company from Eao to Jask, and of the land lines from that place to Karachi, has also devolved upon the Indian Government and has_ tenoed to increase an already preponderant influence over both the waters and the shores of this sea. Latterly there has been a deliberate but necessary con- solidation ot our influence m certain quarters where trouble threatened or where rivalry was feared. At the north-west extremity of the Gulf, we have under instructions from Her Majesty’s Government, entered into engagements with the still independent Sheikh of Koweit, hy which he has bound himself and his successors not to receive the representative of any other Tower and not to alienate any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power—a proceeding which was dictated hy the increasing encroachment of Turkish authority and hy the incipient intrigues of othei^Powers. Similar machinations are known to be in progress at Bahrein, and will require to he counteracted hy a more strict enforcement of the conditions to which the Sheikh is by treaty hound. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but included within the sphere of its political influence, the Arab State of Maskat has for years been controlled by British influence; its trade is similarly in Anglo- Indian hands; and its ruler has not merely for years been subsidised by the Government of India, but in 1891 entered into an Agreement with us, under the orders of Her Majesty’s Government, not to alienate any portion of his dominions to any other Power. 27. Such, briefly summarised, is the position that has been won by Great Britain, not without the expenditure of many millions of money and the sacrifice of many valuable lives, in the Persian Gulf. In its vindication we have more than once been called upon to enter into military occupation of ports or islands in the Gulf. The island of Kharak was occupied by Indian forces from 1838 to 1812, and again in 1856-57. Bushire was held during the latter years, as also were Mohammerah and Ahwaz upon the Earun. The occupation of these places was an illustration of the vigour with which in past years our ascendency has been maintained. Their abandonment was a proof of the reluctance which has invariably been displayed to emphasise or to perpetuate these responsibilities. The latter, however, no less than the British position in Southern Persia in general, are now threatened by an external competition, to the evidences of which we next turn. 28. Sir M. Durand has in general terms described the commanding posi tion which the proximity of the Trans-Caspian Railway and of her Central Asian garrisons, the construction of the Ashkabad-Kuchan-Mcshc: cai ■ ro ^ &gt; an , ie annual expenditure of large sums of money, have enabled ussia o a ® TP ^ the politics and commerce of the province of Khorasan. We proceed to develop the argument by showing how the Khorasan position has been and being utilised as the base of a further and more souther y a vance. 29. It was in 1889 that the campaign of what may be te ?ned the Vili fication of Khorasan was opened with the appointment of a K^sian Consul General at Meshed. In 1891 a native trader, named Hap Agha, appe&amp; r [ 10 ] Bussian News-agent at Birjand; and an emi^snrv rvP 'Koa j. Muhammad Rahim Khan who had already bee/dismissed from the^Rn^n service, was again taken into employ, and was posted as News-agent at Nasim had in Seistan In the succeeding years Russian Armenians, trained at Ixflis, were busily at work surveying the country in a southerly direction as far as the borders of Persia and Baluchistan. In 1895 a more direct Mow a the large Anglo-Indian trade which at that time still made its wav through Xborasan mto the Russian possessions in Central Asia, was struck by the introduction of a Customs Tariff in Trans-Caspia, absolutely prohibiting the entry mto the Russian territories of all British or Indian products except indigo, tea and muslm, and these only nnder a heavy dnty. In the same year M. Zaiondny, a Kussian politico-geologist, Anglice surveyor, paid his first visit to Kam and Seistan. Russian News-agents were also placed at Tabhas and Neh, as well as at iiirjand and Nasirabad. 3(h In the meantime, in the latter part of 1896, the Government of India had decided upon taking active measures to open the long closed trading route from Quetta to Seistan. These intentions, and the prospective British interest in Seistan to which they testified, excited much concern in Russia; and in the following year the outbreak of plague in India offered to the Russian authorities a welcome opportunity of, at the same time, endeavouring to strangle the new enterprise at its birth, and increasing their own influence in Seistan. Under the pretext of establishing a protective cordon to safeguard the Perso-Afghan frontier in Persian interests from a disease which existed neither in Baluchistan nor in Afghanistan, Russian Cossacks nnder Russian officers were planted at a number of places in Persian territory, where they turned back every caravan (ignoring an agreement that had been arrived at between Great Britain and Persia for a 10 days quarantine upon caravans arriving from infected countries), declined to accept any orders except those which came directly from the Russian Legation, and for a time absolutely closed the Herat-Meshed road, in spite of orders to the contrary from the Persian Government—the object of this measure being to divert Afghan trade from Meshed to Panjdeh and Merv in Russian territory. It was significant that upon crossing the Russian frontier the caravans, which had been refused passage through Persia under any condi tions, were only detained fur three days in quarantine. The Persian Govern ment, after a feeble protest, acquiesced in these proceedings; and it may almost he said that Southern Khorasan passed for a time nnder Russian control. 31. It was with the object of anticipating a similar Russian intervention in Seistan that, in the spring of 3 897, the Government of India despatched Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh to superintend any preventive measures that miglit he required in that district. Already Lieutenant Webb Ware, who had visited Seistan in Mi arch, in connection with the trade route, had repoited . I was disagreeably astonished to find what ascendency Russia had gained thiough- ont Seistan ”. ‘Major Brazier-Creagh, a few months later, wrote : “ I was by no means surprised to find what ascendency the Russians had gained in the country. In the past four years Russian activity has been very manifest. It is not limited to Seistan, but extends all along the Perso-Afghan frontier up to Meshed, News-writers and agents being established at all the important trade centres, viz., Neh, Birjand, Tabbas, Khaf, and lurbat-i-Haidari 32 The recommendations made by the British officer were ignored by the Persian authorities; and he had not been long in Seistan when the expected Russian doctor (Miladchevsky by name), witii an escort of eight Cossacks, appeared upon the scene, a detachment of ten Cossacks under a Russian officer being also posted at Turbat-i-Haidan, 80 miles south of Meshed a point of junction of several caravan roads, so as effectually to stop any traffic fo or from^Seistan. An incidental result of Dr Miladchevsky s ^ Se^an was the dismissal, in consequence of a report from ^ Russian agents to whom reference has been made, and the Persian sub -contractors for customs for Ram 1 , vere duals proved to be equally faithless to the interests of then employer,, and wem[ 11 ] relieved of the representation of Russian interests in u « „ year.. It was then announced that a Russian, named^Z edte ^had^heen appointed Russian Consul in Seistan-an announcement which ’ wts imte diately followed by the despatch of Capto SyM totrBrMsh CoZl at Kerman to Setstan m a similar capacity! The Russian Consul would annoar not yet to have taken up his post; and the Eussian authorities are believed Si EfoCS.*;.* H “ Government beta 5 Sl^ 33. Meanwhile m 1898, M. Zaroudny re-appeared upon the scene of his foimer labours, and on the present occasion pushed his politico-scientific t'i'l'T/ aLIT m?J e A!!. an „„ Bal ' chista ? and Bamnur. Early in the present (7 ; y . j , —emu ju v^usbciuhs at ivarez. mere are also 58 1 ersian sowars scattered about at different places between Meshed and beistan, who are paid through the Russian officers and take their orders from them. The recrudescence of plague in India has in fact provided an excuse for the continuance, just as its original appearance was pleaded in support of the in troduction, of a Russian Protectorate in Southern Khorasan. A more active assertion of the same pretensions has since been witnessed in the mission of M. Stroeff, Dragoman to the Russian Consulate at Meshed, with presents valued at £1,400, to the Persian Governor of Rain, who is brother to the Governor of Seistan and is believed to covet the succession to that post. The sanitary plea was also advanced in the course of the past summer to explain the despatch of Russian dectors to Kerman and even to Shiraz. An interesting commentary upon these proceedings may he found in an observation in Lieutenant Webb Ware’s report upon the Quetta-Seistan trade route for 1897-98, where he says that “ the chief hindrance to the further development of this route is to be found in the obstructive measures taken by the Russian officers striving to further the interests of that country at the expense of India.” 34. The facts which we have enumerated will, we think, he sufficient to convince Your Lordship of two propositions : firstly, that Russia regards with unconcealed aversion the opening of the British commercial route from India to Seistan and Khorasan, and will spare no efforts to rob it of success; secondly, that she regards with an interested eye the future of Seistan itself, and is already preparing, by a display of armed force and by the assumption of executive authority, to pave the way for an eventual inclusion within the Russian sphere of that portion of the Shah’s dominions. 35. In the same context, and as illustrating the political and strategical object which such an advance may he believed to have in view, it will not be forgotten that during the past few years, the Russian Government have constructed a railway from Merv to Kushk upon the Afghan frontier within 80 miles of Herat, and have stacked at the terminus the railway plant for a future extension to Herat itself. Should any doubt be entertained as to the purpose for which this extension (which is destitute of any commercial justifi cation) was planned, it may be solved by a reference to the frank admission made to Sir N. O’Conor by M. deWitte, Russian Minister of Pmanee, m June 1898 that it was designed “ to enable Russia to attack Afghanistan in case of complications with England ”. When it is remembered that such an attack can only be made in direct violation of solemn international engagements, it is not, we think, incumbent upon us to argue at further length that the political ambitions of Russia in Eastern Persia, and m close proximity to the Afghan border, have an ulterior significance which it would be folly to ignore. 36 Nor can we divorce these proceedings from the idea that, :n seeking to obtain a preferential footing in Seistan, Russia is not merely endeavouring ^o block a promising avenue of Anglo-Indian trade, and to acquire a position of Potential menace to British interests on the western flank of Afghanistan but P ttt sheS'rconcevnedin the prosecution of » ^ kno^ expected to terminate until it has brought her to the Persian Gulf, it is hnownh [ 12 ] S cess n t0 R r ia 0f a Russian and the Persian Governments • „ ? 1£ . f aTI ; taliBn .

Sir M. Durand his recently informed us by telegraph that the corps of so-called Persian CossackI at lehran (i.e., Persian soldiers trained and commanded by Russian officers) has been raised from 1,000 to 1,500 men, and that detachments of this corps have for the first time been taken with them to the south by the Governors of Shiraz and Arabistan, Por the present the Russian officers have stayed behind; but it is not difficult to imagine the circumstances in which they might claim to rejoin their regiments. In 1897, M. Krugelow was sent from Jerusalem as Russian Consul to Baghdad, with the special object of reporting upon the acquisition by Russia of a coaling station in the Persian Gulf. This gentleman has taken much interest in Koweit, where Russian emissaries from Baghdad have been residing continuously during the present year. In this context it will not be forgotten that the concession recently sought for with the aid of the Russian Embassy at Constantinople by Count Kapnist, a Russian of high rank, for a railway from Tripoli in Syria to the Persian Gulf contemplated a terminus at Koweit. 38. In Bushire and Bunder Abbas the Russians have lately developed a marked interest. Two Russian doctors (Drs. Marc and Oust) arrived at Bushire in 1897 for the now familiar purpose of studying the plague, which, however, did not make its appearance until two years later, in 1899. Dr. Marc in 1897 occupied his waiting hours in visiting Bunder Abbas, from whence he was in the habit of despatching official reports to his Government, and where he magnanimously treated all patients free of charge. His medical pursuits at this place were assisted by a third Russian, named Adamoff, who appears to have been an artillery officer, and who subsequently visited Bushire and Basrah. In 1898 two other Russian doctors, named Rodzewitz and Kornajevski, appeared upon the scene, and visited Basrah, Bushire and Bunder Abbas. In December 1898 a fifth Russian doctor, named Paschkowski, arrived in the Gulf, and did not fail to pay the regulation visit to Bunder Abbas; while he displayed a considerable professional activity during the recent outbreak of plague at Bushire, wdiere he has announced that, upon his approaching return to Russia, he is to be replaced by two compatriots. In connection with this medical propaganda, it will be in Your Lordship’s recollection that when the first rumours were circulated of plague at Bushire in the past summer, the Russian Legation at Tehran at once announced their intention of sending doctors with Cossack escorts, to Bushire as well as Shiraz, in order to establish a nlao’ue cordon for the protection of those places from the Indian pestilence, and that Russian doctors took up their quarters both at Shiraz and Kerman. These precautions might be thought to indicate a praiseworthy desire to close every conceivable channel of entry into Asiatic Russia against the plague, were they not, as has already been shown, in striking contrast with the laxity of system, that is at the same time observed both on the Perso-Russian and on the Russo-Afghan frontiers, across which alone can plague succeed m entering the Russian dominions. In continuation of our story it may be mentioned Sat in 1895 a Russian officer visited and surveyed the island of Hormuz opposite to Bunder Abbas, and that other and non-medical Russian emissarieshave a lso recently been beard of at tbe latter place (the two latest M Babit chieff and Baron de Schedenore, as lately as August in the present Zrl t should not, moreover be forgotten that it was Russian opposition thaHn '1898 broke down the loan to the Persian Government from the Imperial Bank of Persia, the security of which was to be the customs of the southern ports to be collected by agents of the Bank. ^ 5 39 ' r lT e , a F e aw 1 are that on A P ril the present year, with reference to reports that have been published of Russian designs upon the island of ICkl,™ adjoining Hormuz Count Mouravieff assured Sir C.

But our faith in the value of this assurance has been somewhat shaken by the later information received from a Persian official of high rank and station, known personally to the Viceroy, to the effect that he believes Russia to have acquired certain rights in regard to a port in the Persian Gulf, which however it may not suit her at once to enforce. Moreover there is in practice a limit to the duration of all such pledges, which, even if given by|the sovereign, are not always regarded as. binding by his officials; and previous experience is not altogether encouraging to the belief in a prolonged existence of the present undertaking, should circumstances compel an opposite course. There are more over other means, well-known to Her Majesty’s Government from recent experience in other parts of the world, of obtaining political and territorial influence, independently of the actual acquisition of harbours or stations. 40. It is, in our opinion, more than a coincidence that simultaneously with the increasing Russian interest in Central and Southern Persia which we have described, there should also have been a notable revival of Erench activity in those quarters. In 1896 the Messageries Maritimes Company commenced a subsidised service from Bombay to the ports of the Persian Gulf; although, owing to vessels of unsuitable draught having been employed, the enterprise was not a success and was shortly abandoned. In 1897 a Erench Vice-Consul (M. Eerrand) was for the first time appointed at Bushire, although the value of Erench trade with the Persian Gulf in that year amounted only to the modest total of He was succeeded in 1898 by M. Bryois, who recently informed the agent of one of the British Trading Companies at Bushiie that the Erench Government intended shortly to establish a subsidised line of steamers to Mohammerah and the Karun. It was perhaps in connection with this project that in March 1899, M. Bryois paid a visit to the Karun, where a Erench scientific party, under M. de Morgan, has for some time been engaged in politico-arch geological researches in Arabistan- When the French Charge d’Affaires, Comte d’Arlot, recently visited Ispahan,, the Zil-es-Sultan vouch safed the corroborative information to the British Legation that the object of these movements on the part of the Erench was to obtain a footing at Mohammerah Shushter and Dizful. During our recent negotiations with the Sheikh ot Koweit about the future of that harbour, it was with some surprise that we learned from him that the Erench had already approached him on the subject.

Confirmation of our suspicions re^ardin 0, a Franco-Russian entente in Persia and in the Persian Gulf is further affoSed by a telegram, dated June 7th, 1899, from Sir M. Durand to Colonel Meade, which has already been communicated both to Your Lordship and to the Foreign Office, and in which Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran remarks : “ You may be quite certain that Russia and France are working in unison 42. It should be noted that in the recent papers, with copies of which we have been favoured by Her Majesty’s Government, we have found a repudiation of French ambitions in the quarter under discussion, no less explicit than that which we have already quoted from the lips of Count Mouravieff. On July 19th, 1899, M. Cambon said to Lord Salisbury that “ France had no political aspiration whatever in the Persian Gulf; that she did not desire any kind of fortification or settlement or political privileges, or anything beyond the maintenance of those rights already insured to her by treaty ”, We have been gratified to read this assurance, by which we hope that succeeding French ministries may hold themselves bound. But we regret that it has not been communicated, not merely to Her Majesty’s Government, but also to the French Agents in those regions, who do not appear to be equally acquainted with the views of the Government that they serve. 43. In recent years Germany has begun to display a positive and an increasing interest in Persia and also in the Persian Gulf. This interest has been the historical, and perhaps the natural, sequel of a commercial policy that has for some time aimed at securing the control of the principal railways in the Turkish dominions in Asia Minor, and of a political ambition, that more recently still, would appear to aim at the protection of the Ottoman Empire, alike in Europe and Asia. The obvious corollary to a system of German railways in Asia Minor, would be similar railroads to the^ Persian border and through Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf. Already, as Sir M. Durand has in formed the Foreign Office, the Germans have procured a concession for the construction of a road from Khanikin, on the Turko-Persian frontier, to e iran, and have apparently only abstained from pressing for a railroad m the same quarter, because of the violent opposition with which the Russian Minister met the proposal at Tehran.

We have gathered together these symptoms of external, and notably of Russian or of Russophil, interest in Southern Persia and in the Persian Gulf, not because we desire to invest them individually with an importance to which they are not entitled, but because collectively they indicate, in a manner that is not open to misinterpretation, the policy and ambitions of foreign Powers, and because we desire to impress upon Her Majesty’s Government the fact that in an area, by land and by sea, which Great Britain regards with good reason as falling within her sphere of influence, that influence is being directly and increasingly challenged by other nations, who, in proportion as their foothold becomes more securely established, will resist any preferential claims, upon what ever foundation in history or in fact they may rest, and will claim for themselves an equality of right which in theory it may be difficult to contest. 48. More particularly do these considerations apply to the case of Russia, •whose advance across the deserts that form a natural barrier of division between Northern and Southern Persia, cannot be regarded with anything but uneasiness by the Government of India, and the appearance ot whose flag m the Persian Gulf would import a novel element of unrest into is at no time without its anxious features. V e a sifnation that desire deliberately to say to1© [ 16 ] power upon the northern and north-western frontiers of IndSTl p USS1 ? U to Herat, we could not contemplate without tom' the ~ “ of RusS neighbourhood m Eastern or Southern Persia, the ineyitabkcoLeouence of wluch must he a great increase of our own burdens; while the maritime defensibility of India would require to he altogether reconsidered were the dangers of a land invasion to be supplemented by the appearance of a possible antagonist as a naval power in waters contiguous to Indian shores. 49. We cannot pretend to divine the future, or to sav' whether anv European Power, and if so which, will at anytime push her advance to the pomt °f claiming a maritime outlet m or near to the Persian Gulf. The fate of Mesopotamia lies beyond our ken: audit may he that in the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, some stronger Power may one day exercise dominion at Baghdad, may occupy Basrah, and may demand access for its vessels to the neighbouring waters of the Gulf. Such a consummation, it is in our opinion, in the interests of British policy, as long as may be possible, to postpone. But upon the question of allowing any European Power, and more especially Bussia, to overrun Central and Southern Persia, and so to reach the Gulf, or to acquire naval facilities in the latter even without such territorial connections, we do not conceive that any doubt whatever can be entertained; and we imagine that it will be accepted as a cardinal axiom of British policy that no such development would be acquiesced in by Her Majesty’s Government. We would arrive with the greater confidence at this conclusion, since we were lately informed by Your Lordship that on April 15th of the present year, Lord Salisbury communicated to the Persian Government with reference to rumours of the cession of a port in the Gulf to Bussia, that “ Her Majesty’s Government felt it to be their duty to renew the intimation that it would not be compatible with the interests of the British Empire that any European Power should exercise control or jurisdiction over the ports of the Persian Gulf”. 50. Such being the existing situation in Southern Persia, and the prin ciples of policy accepted by Her Majesty’s Government being as already stated, we pass to a consideration of the manner in which these principles should be translated into action, and of the steps which should, in our opinion, be taken at the present juncture for the protection of the common interests of Great Britain and the Indian Empire. 51. We are aware that more than half a century ago, there were exchanged, and have more than once since been repeated, certain explicit assurances concerning the integrity and independence of Persia between the Governments of Great Britain and Bussia. The first of these assurances were entered into by Lord Palmerston and Count Nesselrode. The former in a despatch, dated September 5th, 1834, placed on record that “ the Governments of Great Britain and Bussia are acting, with regard to the affairs of Persia in the same spirit, and are equally animated by a sincere desire to maintain, not only the internal tranquillity, but also the independence and integrity of Persia ”. Count Nesselrode, in despatches, dated October 20th, 1838, and January 29th, 1839, reiterated these pledges on behalf of his Government. Again m 1873 the continued existence of these mutual assurances was referred to with satisfaction by Count de Brunnow, as reported in a despatch by Lord Granville, dated July 10th, 1873. Einally, on March 12th, 1888, M. de Giers intimated, through M. de Staal, to Lord Salisbury that the Bussian Government “ have no objection to placing again on record that their views on this point are in no way altered ” ; and a communication to the effect that the engagements between Great Britain and Bussia to respect and promote the integrity and independence of the Persian kingdom had again been renewed and contirmed, was accordingly made by Sir H. 1). Wolff to the Shah. 52. Whilst it may be presumed that these pledges, so frequently renewed, are still in existence, and while we have no desire to infer that they arowithin measurable distance they are in themselves ice in Pe__ from the [ 17 ] tiiey are m tliemselves quite°in^ G ,; are y et . °f opinion that Itussian influence in Persia or to save rith ^ ^ ce ntnpetal progress of mav continue to i P ™ th - lm of constl ^tional fiction, where they ^ 2 &amp;aca !5 as a^;rs&amp;r ss !«aB^£5t*S c ion by Great Bntam and Russia to insist upon reforms, to reorganise^ the administration and finances, to develop the resources of the count?y to lend n ^ anS5 m faC M t0 1 C0 . Ilvert tlie Persian Government by combined p lanthrojy from a moribund into a solvent institution. This policy was dis cussed and rejected by Sir M. Durand in his Memorandum of September 1895 on the ground that Russia would denounce us to the Shah to begin with, and worild play us false afterwards; and in his despatch of February 1899, he again “ proceeds upon the assumption that we cannot hope to come to terms with Russia, and persuade her to join us in a policy of reform and development.” We concur with Her Majesty’s Minister in believing that the reform of Persia by a policy of friendly co-operation between Prussia and ourselves is out of the question; and we do so in the main for the reason, which no one familiar w r ith Persia will deny, that Russia is interested not in the reform of Persia, but in its decay; that in the background of her ambitions is the vision of a country and a people falling from inherent debility into her grasp; and that any policy which might tend to strengthen the country or to revivify the people, is to be resisted as tending to thwart the fulfilment of those ambi tions. We might give many illustrations in support of this proposition; but we will content ourselves with one. Sir M. Durand has lately supplied to the Foreign Office the version given by the Sadr Azam of the agreement between the Persian and Russian Governments, by which the former bound itself in 1889 not to grant any railway concessions to any other Power than Russia, except with the consent of the latter, for a period of 10 years. Whatever be the real facts of the case, there can be no doubt that this engagement, as long as it has lasted, and so long as it continues to last, is an effective harrier to any genuine development of the country. It was due to expire in the present year. Our latest information from Sir M. Durand is that it has, under pressure from the Russian Government, been renewed for another term of five years. 54. The alternative policy recommended by Sir M. Durand is that we should plainly intimate that any Russian encroachments in Northern Persia will provoke corresponding measures for the protection of British interests in the south. In his Memorandum of September 1895, Her Majesty’s Minister suggested that this declaration should be made to the Russian Government. In his despatch of February 1899 he proposed that it should also be made to the Persian Government; so that both parties should be well aware of the steps that would follow upon any further Russian aggression. It has been objected to this policy that such an engagement might impose upon the British Govern ment an unwelcome obligation to intervene and to add to British responsibi lities in Southern Persia, at the moment most opportune to Russia, and least opportune to ourselves. There is force in this objection; although ve think that it might be met by introducing sufficient elasticity into the proposed intimation to leave Her Majesty’s Government free to act for the protection of British interests in Southern Persia, not in a specified manner at a specified moment, but in what manner and at what juncture might commend itself to their judgment. Moreover the value of the objection is somewhat weakened bv the consideration that did Russia take any such step m Northern Persia as is here contemplated, counter-action of some sort, witli or wit ion a pievious^ eYer tlieless before we recommend that such a policy should he essayed, we desire to raise the question whether, though it be impossible to conclude an agreement with Russia for the joint patronage and development or i eisia, it might not yet be possible to come to an understanding with her loi^the separate patronage and development of that country in distinct and clearlv defined compartments by the two great Powers, in other words for a recognition of British and Russian spheres of interest in the dominions of the Shah. This is a solution the desirability of which has not been lost sight of by Sir M. Durand, but which for certain reasons he did not feel called upon to discuss. Recent events in China have familiarised the public mind with the idea of such spheres of interest, although their existence would appear to be still somewhat lacking both in clearness of definition and in precision of outline. The Viceroy has observed in recent telegrams from Lord Salisbury to Sir M. Durand with reference to a Persian loan and to mining concessions in that country, indications of a willingness to concede to Russia liberties in the north of Persia, parallel in scope and substance with those conceded to Great Britain in the south; and it is worthy of consideration whether in an expansion of this suggestion might not be found a feasible scheme. 56. We have already alluded to the line across Persia drawn by Sir M. Durand from Khanildn on the Turkish frontier, through Kermanshah, Ramadan, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman to Seistan, as indicating the northern limits of the sphere within which British political influence and trade are paramount. To some extent this partition is assisted by geographical conditions, the great deserts of Central Persia constituting a natural barrier between the north and the south, and roughly dividing the one from the other. But this situation is modified both in the west of Persia, where there are no deserts, and where there is no physical line of demarcation between the respective spheres of influence; in the centre of Persia, where Ispahan can hardly be said to constitute the natural frontier of any geographical zone; and also in the extreme east. where Seistan, the inclusion of which in the British sphere would be an obligatory point, lies not to the south but to the north of the great deseit. These con siderations might not affect the success of any engagement that was carried out with equal bona jides by both parties: but they might become a fruitful source -f-mV+inn wavp. sneh a emod understanding not to be counted upon in tne its own account or on sphere, and not to obstruct, diiectly or concessions, supported by the other in that £ . —,1, T. ri-n/Ul on a n&gt;Y*£»OT pailu ays and trade. We do not think, if[ 19 ] predicated line, Th^rthere woSTe^u^end^o^R 8 * nd S ?

We have already hinted at one of their number. The facts with reference to Seistan which have been mentioned by the Viceroy m his Minute, by Sir M. Durand, and also in tZ despatch, indicate the absolute necessity of including that district within the Bntish sphere. Nevertheless Seistan is physically and administratively a part ot the province of Khorasan, from which it is severed by no clear line of division, the Governorship of Seistan being vested in a member of the old ruling family of Kain, the two existing heads of which are brothers, residino' respectively at Tabbas and Birjand. It also seems exceedingly doubtful to us whether Russia would, .by any such agreement as we are discussing, forego her designs, upon Seistan itself, and still more her chances of reaching the eastern extremity of the Persian Gulf. Nor again is it clear that she would be willing to cancel the engagement with regard to railway construction, which she has recently renewed with the Persian Government, and to hand over the southern half of Persia to possible railway exploitation by British agency, in return for a monopoly of similar exploitation (which may he said to be already at her disposal) in the northern half. These, however, are considerations which could only he decided by the attitude of Russia herself, were she approached on the subject by Her Majesty’s Government. We indicate them merely for the purpose of showing that we are far from confident that the suggestion, if put forward, w T ill meet with a favourable reception. 59. A more serious drawback, from the point of view of British interests, is the fact that the capital of Persia would lie in the northern or Russian sphere j and that Russian influence there, already predominant, could hardly fail to become supreme. The situation that has recently arisen in China would present itself with ten-fold gravity and emphasis. A desire would not merely be inti mated to connect the capital with the Russian railway system : hut a line itself would, we may imagine, at once be made to Tehran, while corresponding lines would in all probability be constructed from the Russian frontier in Georgia to Tabriz, and in Trans-Caspia to Meshed. With the three great cities of Northern Persia thus permanently linked with the Russian system, the power of pressure exercised by the Russian Government, which is already considerable, would be positively overwhelming. The Shah would tend more and more to become a Russian puppet, and Northern Persia a Russian proconsulate. We should look with great anxiety, in such a case, upon the fate of such institutions as the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the Indo-European Telegraph Department, whose head-quarters are in Tehran. We should fear a marked diminution of influence on the part of Her Majesty’s representative at the capital; and we do not conceal our anticipations that in the long run such a partition might involve the permanent break up of the Persian kingdom, and, it it did no ultimately lead to rival Russian and British Protectorates m the north and south, might at any rate result in the selection of another capital, and m the rule of more than one native prince in Persia. 60. Neither will it be overlooked by Her Majesty’s G overnment that, while any such arrangement with Russia might preclude tiiat lower from[ 20 ] at present to discuss, and wliich would require to be examined on independent grounds. Nor again would an Anglo-Russian agreement preclude France or AY 0th ^. Vo Y GV from ; endeavouring to acquire in Southern Persia v the .POsition from which Russia would ex hypothesi have debarred T'hpsjp^iin even be combined action between them for that object. These however are features inseparable from the solution which we are dis cussing, and which should not be of a formidable character, if the influence of the principal competitor were removed from the scene. They might be the cause of future annoyance to the British Government; but they could hardly ilnder any conditions, constitute a menace to the Indian Empire. 61. ^ There remains the further danger, distinctly contemplated by Sir M* Durand in discussing the question of a possible understanding with Russia, that she would, not abide by the terms of any such understanding. Sufficient grounds for this induction may unquestionably be found in the history of Russian advance in. Central Asia during the past half century. But an appreciation of the inclinations and idiosyncrasies of both parties to an agreement, in the light* where possible, of past experience, is an element in the drawing up of a fresh bargain which is not likely to be lost sight of by either agent, whether it be regarded as involving a discount from, or an appreciation of, the value of the new contract. Moreover such contracts, if not of perpetual duration, or even if ultimately infringed by one of the two parties, have been shown in many cases to be of immense value, in the respite that they afford from the strain of an otherwise ceaseless rivalry, and in the opportunity presented for a peaceful consolidation of existing interests. 62. We have now placed before Your Lordship t\iQ pros and cons, as they present themselves to our eyes, of the alternative policies in Persia. Should Her Majesty’s Government decide upon making any overtures to the Russian Government in the direction indicated, and should they either be rejected, or result in failure, it will still be possible to adopt the alternative recommended by Sir M. Durand. Indeed, if the terms of a reasonable arrangement are proffered by one party, and are refused by the other, the natural corollary would appear to be that the originator of the proposal should reserve to himself the right to protect by whatever means may be at his disposal the interests which he has endeavoured to conserve by friendly co-operation; and should meet what would in such a case be conscious aggression on the one side by retaliation on the other. 63. In either case, however, though still more in the case of a failure to arrive at an understanding with Russia, we conceive that it is incumbent upon Her Majesty’s Government and upon the Government of India to ^ ome an early decision upon the subsidiary question, raised by Sir M. Durand, namely, as to the steps that require forthwith to be taken in order to safeguard British and Indian interests in the so-called British sphere in Persia from the competi tion with which we have shown them to be threatened. 64. Sir M. Durand, in his despatch, has made a calculation of the sums annually expended by Her Majesty’s Government and the Government of India respectively upon the British establishments at present maintained m Persia. He arrives at a grand total of £36,970 per annum distributed m the following proportions: Her Majesty’s Government, £12,876; Government of India £24,094. Inasmuch as these figures are not, in all respects, correct, and as they omit several items of charge for which Indian revenues are respon sible we have made an independent computation, which is here presented, for nurnoses of comparison in tabular form. In a further column we present the chafes also borne by the Government of India and Her Majesty’s Government severally in respect o^f Mesopotamia and the Tigris-*^., Turkish Arabia, an ama, S though not belonging to the Persian dominions, is so closely adjacent•v [ 22 1 III.

I u 65. According to these figures, which we have been at much pains to verify it appears that upon the various establishments maintained by the British Government m Persia, the Imperial Government spends £15,466 and the Gov ernment of India per annum. If Turkish Arabia be inchded in L calculation, as we think it must m fairness he, and as it was in a statement fn7Z ft^ P^ tedt f 0 fhe Royal Commission on Indian expendhme m 1896, the totals will amount to Great Britain £15,597, India^f4r7,j4. iw’ • ^ no ^ we a PP r8 ^ len d, he denied that these contributions do not at all tairly represent _ the respective proportions of Imperial and of Indian interest in Persia and its surroundings^ The argument into which we entered m an earlier part of this despatch will have failed in its purpose if it has not given good grounds for thinking that in the determination of British interests m Persia too much stress has hitherto been laid upon the Indian, and too little upon the Biitish, quota i and that a more even partition both of responsibility and of financial burden might with reason be adopted in the future. 67. This however is a question which we are not at the present moment called upon to. discuss with any minuteness, the more so as it is understood to be one of the subjects that have attracted the attention of the Boyal Commission above alluded to, and that are likely to be dealt with in its Report. We observe that in the evidence so far printed and published, some attention has been paid to the case, and we reserve till the appearance of the final Report, any further remarks that we may have to offer thereon. 68. We would observe, however, in strict connection with the question now under examination, viz., the increase of Consular and other establishments in Persia—which is itself a branch of the wider subject—that in the reconsider ation of the case for which the Government of India have more than once pleaded, it appears to us that one of two principles may with advantage be borne in view. The entire charges which are placed upon the revenues of the British Empire for Persia and Turkish Arabia may be added together, and may be divided in certain proportions, to be revised, if necessary, at definite intervals, between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. Some such principle was adopted, when in 1859 the British Mission at Tehran was re-transferred to the Eoreign Office, and when it was hid down by Lord John Russell that the ratio of the charges met, by India and Great Britain should be as 12 to 5. We are not aware that this principle has ever since been formally repudiated cr surrendered, although it appears to have been widely departed from in practice. 69. The other method would be that of determining whit are the spheres or localities in Persia of special concern either to Her Majesty s Government or to the Government of India, and of debiting the charges incurred for them ;ainst the revenues respectively of the United Kingdom and of India. It as ■[ 23 ] ThicLtouTd “ ™ w such „ a l : artitioa ° f commercial conditions.

Tim northern Ld ^el ^ fal1 withi “ Caucasian provinces of Russia to Turkey and (,! \/ IOT '' IO , ,K ': 0n ’ 1 =' l&lt; .’ 1 ’ s to the greater interest for Her Majesty’s Government. l^rcSmMe^lhoS'still only a partial, extent this principle has already been acted upon whilst u w be m the recollection of Tour Lordship that the Government oT India hive m one case pressed for a vindication of it, which they have felt to be equally demanded by policy and justice. In February and'again in August 1893 ou? predecessors expressed a very strong opinion that they shoukfnot becked upon to contribute towards the Karim service, as long as the subsidy for the mail servme on the Tigris was met exclusively from Indian revenue! They stated their opinion that “ the interests involved in the Karan service are purely Imperial and not Indian, and, if this service ceases altogether the interests of India will not be affected thereby ”. It was only after the receint of an urgent appeal from the Foreign Office, and on the explicit understanding tiicit the whole question of the distribution of the charges on account of the Tigris and tne J\.arnn should he referred to the Itoyal Commission then sitting, that the Government of Lord Elgin, not without a vigorous dissent from the then Finance Member, Sir J. Westland, consented to continue the payment of a moiety of the Karun subsidy pending the stipulated decision. We cordially endorse the views which were expressed by our predecessors in respect of the Imperial and non-Indian character of this charge, and we shall he glad to learn what are the recommendations of the lloyal Commisaion on the subject. 70. The mention of the Karun and Tigris services affords an incidental illustration of the commercial considerations by which the allocation of respon sibility that w r e are discussing might he determined. It is, of course, difficult to decide in the case of any particular market or harbour the exact shares of interest in it that may be claimed by British or by Indian trade. The former is more likely to he in the ascendant in the north, the latter in the south, of Persia. Broadly speaking, however, we do not think it will he dkputed that the supervision and promotion of British commerce in foreign countries are a responsibility properly devolving upon the Imperial Government. The fact that a considerable proportion of the trade of any foreign town or port passes to or from India (and even of such trade a large part is apt to be often British in origin) is not a reason for placing the consular or other charges exclusively upon 'the Indian revenues, any more than a corresponding preponderance of Colonial trade in any particular quarter would he regarded as a reason for demanding a contribution from the Colonies. We imagine the real line of distinction to he that, whereas the commercial interests of Her Majesty’s Indian subjects, outside of India, are in the main the concern of the Imperial Government, yet in cases where the political importance of a place or district exceeds the commercial, and where that political importance is Indian rather than English in character, the Government of India may leeitimatelv he called upon to defray sometimes a laigo pioportion, some times the whole of the cost. In this way we may account for the exclusive financial responsibility of India for Meshed, for Bushire and the other ports of the Gulf and for Baghdad (although we regard the latter as an extreme and questionable extension of the principle). On the .other hand the charges for Ispahan, Kermanshah, Tabriz, &amp;c„ fall, or ought in our judgment to fall, upon the Imperial revenues. Tehran, as the capital is m a sense, a meeting ground of the two systems ; and a division of the cost between the two Govern ments has accordingly been in existence ever since 1833, although the passage “f time has wtoS a gradual reduction of the Indian contribution, and may we hope, lead to a further reconsideration of the matter, when the present arrangement expires in 1901.[ 24 ] 71. We ill now proceed to cwnlv the m'inoi-nloa i, v (F\ %&gt; of -Bntis i mteiests in^ 1 ersia, in the confident belief that Her Maiesty’s Govern- ment will not be behindhand with a similar generosity. Oar argument as to the magnitude and significance of those interests and the reality of the dangers with which they are assailed would have been insincere, were we unprepared to give to it a practical demonstration. 72. For the sake of clearness we will divide the country into different spheres, representing with sufficient accuracy the rough lines of demarcation between British and Indian interest. In the northern and central sphere, and in the western sphere, tSie responsibility of Her Majesty’s Government is in our judgment more directly involved. In the eastern sphere, and in the southern or maritime sphere, we admit a corresponding preponderance of Indian interest. 73. Commencing with the first named of these areas, we find that Sir M. Durand recommends an improvement in the pay and status of Her Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz. In so far as our judgment on the matter is desired, it is in entire accord with the proposal. We are more doubtful about the suggestion to appoint an additional Vice-Consul at Tabriz, with the intention of posting him later on at Urumia; since we incline to the opinion that the ultimate destiny of the Persian Nestorians has been irretrievably fixed by their recent wholesale conversion to the Russian faith. We concur with Sir M. Durand as to the desirability of reducing the Consulate at Resht to a Vice- Consulate. We have before expressed our hearty concurrence with his pro posals concerning the Consulate at Ispahan, These proposals without excep tion concern in their financial aspect the British, and not the Indian, Exchequer. 74. In the western sphere Sir M. Durand advocates the appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Kermanshah, subordinate to the Consul-General at Tehran, and paid for by England, in place •of the present native agent, whose modest'aUowance of £24 is drawn, for some unaccountable reason, from the charges for the 'Meshed Agency, i.c., from Indian funds. Hie figures of British trade passing through Kermanshah from Baghdad to Tehran appear to us amply to justify the proposed change. We are less confident about a su^estion made by Sir M. Durand, originally in connection with this route, UnTnlar* with a wider application, namely, that we should depute an Indian[ 25 ] entire cost of tte propo^Td tl,at the interested in the Karun question Wp 1 ia ^ ^?^ ia 18 on ^7 indirectly ing liberality in quarters of more mnrhfp^ * 6 to show a correspond- Mohammerah (or t0 India ‘ A “ at British Resident at Bushire, as well as with HerMajesTy’t MiSstoat TeW 6 described 2s 'uTemr^LM^n/fcs^r 1^1“ in * erests be perhaps be saved at Meshed, where the existing establishment imposes Tlon 'rh^h^ r 1688 -^^?’ 154 ayear - Wc are “clined P to the militant charart^ m °l th . e P r0 . xmiit y of Afghanistan, and of tae . ™ 1 f ltant character of Russian pretensions in Khorasan, it is desirable to maintain an _adequate British representation at Meshed, vu think that the present scale is excessive,_ and that the results obtained are incommensurate with the cost. We are considering whether by a reduction of the grade of the Political Agent now stationed there, and by the removal of the Political Assistant to some spot where his services would be of greater value, we might not be able to effect a considerable money saving, to be better applied elsewhere. We are sceptical also as to the value received for the large secret service grant at present made to the Meshed Agency, and expended in the main in procuring unreliable and almost worthless information through native and ill-informed agents. On the other hand, we are prepared to compensate for a less extrava gant expenditure at Meshed by a more vigilant attention to Seistan, and by strenuously fostering the trade route connecting that district with British Baluchistan. The political and strategical importance of Seistan appears to us to justify and even to necessitate the former attitude. We are encouraged to adopt the latter by the figures of trans-Nushki traffic, which have risen from a total of l^r lakh in 1896 to Bs. 5,90,000 in 1897 and (in spite of an adverse season) to Its. 7,28,000 in ] 898, in which year the imports alone into Quetta from Seistan reached the value of Us. 2,50,880. 77. We have some time past been examining the question of the permanent appointment of a British officer to Seistan; and the deputation of Captain Sykes from Kerman to Seistan in the present year, and the sanction of an annual expenditure of £400 from Indian revenues upon a Seistan Consulate, have already been mentioned. The reports of Captain Sykes are strongly adverse to the permanent appointment of a British officer to Seistan; and whilst we do not entirely concur with his reasoning, and regard his views as to some extent coloured by other prepossessions, we nevertheless are of opinion that such an appointment might for the present be postponed; the more so as it appears likely that the nomination of a Russian Consul to Seistan, though previously announced, is likely not to be persevered in, unless a British repre sentative appears permanently upon the scene. Should a Russian officer be ~ J1 • 1 - ^-- ■ L ^ -” 11 — alternative but to send a no finally appointed, we think that there will be British officer also. In the meantime we are prepared to depute a reliable native agent from our Indian service to reside at Nasirabad, the capital of Seistan, and to appoint a second to reside at Birjand, the capital of Kain, both of these officials to be under the orders of the British Resident at Meshed, in correspondence with the Persian arrangements under which Seistan and Kain nrmstitute a nortion of the Governorship-General of Khorassan. We estimate -£2Q0 per annum constitute a portion of the Governorship ^ _ that the annual cost of these two posts will amount to ^1° 1 ~ j’TbT _ more than the already sanctioned charge for the Seistan post; and this addition we are prepared to meet. In making these proposals we have the satisfaction of knowing that we are sure of the support both of Your Lordship and of t ie Poreign Office; since, in a Revenue despatch, dated December 2nd, 1897, Your Lordship in sending to us a letter from the Poreign Office, expressing their good hopes of the future of the Quetta-Meshed route, provided that Consular protection and other facilities were furnished at points al “S th f TO ^&gt; c0 “- mended these remarks to the Government of India, and added.

We agree with Sir M. Durand in thinking that a British Consul should be permanently appointed to Kerman. We have already sanctioned a contribution of Its. 6,000 or £400 a year to the cost of this post • and we are prepared to continue the payment of this sum. We believe that there are good leasons for which Her Majesty’s Government may desire to continue the pay ment of a similar moiety of the cost. But should their acceptance of the increments proposed elsewhere, notably in the case of the Karun, be facilitated by our assumption of the entire cost of the Kerman Consulate, we should be prepared favourably to consider such a proposal; or, if it were preferred to divide with them the cost of the Karun and Kerman Consulates combined! Ihe financial result would in either case be approximately the same. 80. Sir M. Durand has suggested a British Vice-Consul, or a native agent at Bampur. For the present we think that the latter will be the prefer able alternative; and we are prepared to undertake the outlay, which will not exceed about £300 per annum. The officer in question would be under the orders of the British Consul at Kerman. 81. Finally we come to the southern sphere, including the coasts and ports of the Persian Gulf. Your Lordship will have been prepared by what has previously been said for the announcement of our willingness to submit to some sacrifices for the defence of an interest, so substantially grounded, and so conspicuously assailed. We are unable to agree with Sir M. Durand in the sug gestion that any material reduction of expenditure can be effected at Bushire. On the contrary we are disposed to think that, if the best men in our service are to be attracted to that post, we may even require to add to its pecuniary attractions. We agree with him, however, in thinking that the Resident at Bushire should reside at Shiraz, and exercise his consular functions there during the summer months. We understand from Colonel Meade that the cost of a site for a house (no suitable building being available either for hire or purchase) would be from £1,000 to £1,200, and of building and furnishing about £1,500. We think that this expense might be borne in equal proportions by the Imperial and Indian Governments; and we are prepared to undertake the annual outlaythat may be reamrerl fm* „ the Government of India and was sanctioned by the Secretary of State (Lord Kimberley), but was subsequently dropped upon the inexplicable grounds that the estimated cost of Us. 50 a month or £40 a year could not be saved out of the Bushire Residency funds. In 1896, the question was again discussed between the Government of India and the Resident (Colonel Wilson); and the former so far departed from their former attitude as to say that the proposal must be held over until the normal conditions of trade had been restored by the withdrawal of the Russian sanitary cordon. These conditions have since been fulfilled, and we are prepared to look with a more favourable eye upon a proposal, the intrinsic recommendations of which are not open to dispute. We are willing to accept the financial responsibility for the proposed appoint ment, although we think that it may be possible to meet it without additional cost by the transfer to Bunder Abbas of the Political Assistant now stationed at Meshed. Sir M. Durand suggests that the officer appointed to this post should pass the summer months at Yezd (Bunder Abbas being an impossible site of residence during the hot season), taking the place there of the present unpaid Commercial Vice-Consul. Upon this point we would propose to consult Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, which is in close connection with Bunder Abbas and the coast; and we will submit to Your Lordship at a later date our final views upon this subject. 83. Sir M. Durand mentions, as a matter affecting exclusively the Govern ment of India, the possible appointment of a British officer at Bahrein. We do not hesitate to state to Your Lordship that such an appointment is in our opinion both desirable and obligatory. Trouble, similar to that which we have already incurred in Maskat, is brewing in Bahrein, the treaty engagements of which petty State with Her Majesty’s Government provide no legitimate excuse for such complications. It is necessary to anticipate them by placing a British officer permanently in the island; and we are at the present time awaiting Colonel Meade’s definite proposals on the matter. Me are inclined to think that it will probably be sufficient to nominate an officer of a sub ordinate class From time to time he will also visit Koweit. It remains to be decided whether he should also have under his political jurisdiction the Trucial Chiefs of the Arab or Pirate coast, or whether these should be placed under the officer at Bunder Abbas. W r e incline to the former opinion, but reserve this matter for subsequent decision. existing system, under which the political charges') [ 28 ] Irfdo-Buropean^TelegrajJi ^Department^a^Kara 1 !; • &lt;l1 ?

Her Majesty’s Minister also recommends the grant of a supply of travelling tents to every British officer in Persia. As the majority of these under the proposed arrangements, will he upon the Indian list, the suggested oiitlay would require in such cases to be met from Indian funds. We°do not think that any general rule is required. We are in the habit of including camp equipment in the outfit of any officer whose duties require him to travef We may observe, however, that tents are more likely to he required in out-of- the-way parts of the country than they are along the main roads, where the existing chapar or postal service, although destitute of almost every superficial merit, is nevertheless more rapid and therefore as a rule more convenient than travelling by caravan. 87. Lastly, Sir M. Durand makes certain recommendations with regard to the improvement and better organisation of the Telegraph service in Persia, both native and European. We concur with his suggestion that no oppor tunity should he lost of getting the Persian wires, which are abominably mismanaged, transferred to our control. He then revives a suggestion, of which much has been heard during the last 20 years, that we should “ organise for political purposes” the existing establishment of the Indo-European Telegraph Department; although we do not gather very clearly from his despatch what are the precise measures recommended for that purpose. The last occasion on which a somewhat similar proposal appears to have been made was in 1887, when a Memorandum, dated April 27th of that year, was drawn up by Sir Murdoch Smith, who was despatched on a semi-political Mission to Persia, and who recommended -that capable military officers should be scattered about the country, nominally in charge of the Telegraph stations, but in reality as political agents. In a despatch, dated June 24th, 1887, the Government of India expressed a general, hut guarded, approval of the scheme. In our opinion there are two sides to the question, for each of which much can he said. It is surprising to us that an institution and a service that have exercised such an influence and are so generally popular in Persia, as the Indo-European Telegraph Department, should not have been attended with more visible political effect. On the other hand, in proportion as the working of the line has become system atised, so there has been less call for the type of Engineer Officer who was required during earlier and more troubled days. The work at the majority of the stations does not admit of much leisure on the part of the signallers and line inspectors. At the more important posts we believe that a consider able, though unobtrusive, influence is already exerted by the superior officers; and we are not convinced that the appearance upon the scene of a number s I: . • • • - • [ 29 J of English, officers, whose telegraphic duties wmiPi ; -ri , political or semi-political functions, miffht not armL re ^ ty be ^o^inate to some friction.

But the objects for which such an estabh'shtent is there ept up are neither exclusively, nor, as we think, mainly Indian in character. 1 e same remark applies to the Basrah Consulate, where Her Majesty’s Govern- ment have recently taken into their hands the appointment of the Consul while leaving the entire charge to be defrayed from Indian funds. Least of all can such a claim he made for the Tigris subsidy, which, in our opinion, tails into the category of commercial arrangements properly devolving upon Her Majesty’s Government; although under existing conditions the total cost is borne by Indian revenues. We trust that, in any reconsideration of the case, a more generous division of financial responsibility may commend itself to Her Majesty’s Government. 89. We have now completed our survey of the proposals that have been submitted to us for examination, and of the situation in Persia as it presents itself to our eyes. In commending our views to the earnest consideration of Your Lordship and of Her Majesty’s Government, we trust that we may have succeeded in impressing upon both, the gravity of the situation with which Great Britain and India are jointly faced, and the necessity, while there is yet time, of meeting it with definite and united counsels. We conclude by reiterat ing the confident hope, already expressed in our despatch of August loth, 1898, that in the last resort, and in any sudden emergency, we may rely upon Her Majesty’s Government for the protection of interests which are vital both to India and to the British Empire. We have the honour to he, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) CURZON OF KEDLESTON. „ W. S. A. LOCKHART. „ E. H. H. COLLEN. „ C. M. RIVAZ. „ C. E. DAWKINS. „ T. RALEIGH. ,, E. GAELICEILNo. of 1899. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To The Uight Hon’ble LORD GEORGE E. HAMILTON, Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the th September 1899. Mr Lord, We desire to address Your Lordship and, through Your Lordship, Her Majesty’s Government on the subject of the relations of Great Britain with Persia. We might find an adequate reason for so doing in the fact that Your Lordship in your despatch of June 30th, 1899, enclosing a copy of a recent despatch to the Eoreign Office from Sir M. Durand, Hex Majesty s Minister at Tehran, concerning the maintenance of our influence in Persia, has directly invited an expression of the views of the Government of India upon this matter; and, while calling our attention to the desirability of improv ing the Political and Consular Service in that country, has at the same time stated vour desire to be made acquainted with our opinions upon the remaining questions discussed by Sir M. Durand. Bat, in any case, we should have felt it our duty at an early date to address Your Lordship on the subject. Although the relations of Great Britain with Persia have for a period of exactly a century occupied a large, and perhaps at times a disproportionate, space upon the field of international diplomacy ; although during that time Great Britain has twice broken off diplomatic relations and has once been at war with Persia m vindication of British interests in or upon the borders of that country ; and althou°'h large sums of money have been throughout the present century an are still annually expended in the maintenance of those interests, both by Her Maiestv’s Government and by the Government of India, we have not been able 6 t(Tdiscover in our records any clear definition of the principles upon which able to uiscovci . i • i ; n , r w rY1 Wod of the obiects which it should our policy “ ds f and limits of the respective shares of responsibility, keep m view, or ot « P , ,, b(j assumec i by the two partners, viz., Her fS S C ty’s a Gov™nt and the Government of India, who are jointly concerned in^he defence hi Anglo-Indian interests in the dominions of the Shah. 2 We feel that there is at the present time the greater nee or vv , ,, W1 f, w ,, Q wi.iph must be patent to all, that tne rersian discussion, because of the fa , t d „ii -power of recuperation or Government appears well nigh o - ^ tcr'ether by any tie either of race, reform; and that the country, but feebly W^ch it must otherwise have religion, or loyalty is ^ vihlity not infrequently seen long ago succumbed, paitly y P even when in an advanced stage in political organisms especially m the Last, even European Powers of decay, still more by the nval ambitions of the two arbiters of its between whom its territories are placed, and wnomunicated, and the already shattered structure tumbles into irretrievable ruin. 3. We think that there are signs that such an issue, if not immediately impendin o&gt; in Persia, is drawing near. The rule of the present Shah is distinctly and uniformly weaker than that of his predecessor. The dissolvent agencies at work in the Persian kingdom are more active and persistent. Meanwhile, the encroachments of Russian power are steadfastly pursued and are less veiled by any pretence of concealment. Other Governments and nationalities, either impelled by the secret obligations of international sympathies, or attracted by a desire to share in the probable spoils, are appearing upon the scene; and there is every reason to believe that, as in the case of the Ottoman Empire and of China, so also here, the property of the sick man, should no steps be taken in advance to prolong his existence, and should the end come before any testamentary dispositions have been made, is likely to be subject of bitter contention between the various parties who may demand to be included among his heirs. 4. We desire, therefore, not merely to examine, in response to Your Lordship’s invitation, the particular steps that may require to be taken for the maintenance or extension of British interests in Persia at the present juncture, but to survey a wider field, and, while there is yet time, to discuss how those interests should be definitely safeguarded in the future that seems to be imminent, and what part in the outlay or in the measures that may be necessitated for that end, should be assumed respectively by Her Majesty’s Government and by the Government of India. Sir M. Durand himself concludes his despatch by saying that “ the time has come for us to lay down a definite line of policy”. We concur in this opinion, but we interpret the obligation thus admitted in a broader sense than Her Majesty’s Minister has done; and we think that no mere stop-gap measures, however useful they may individually be, will avail for the permanent protection of our position in Persia, unless a clear understanding be arrived at in advance as to what that position is and what it demands. 5. It may not be inappropriate to state, in the first nlace. what we calculations that we have made, we believe the estiW-U in ho iho[ 3 ] attribute t° them Mexelusiyely Indian complexion. Ever since the first visit ot the late Shah to Europe Persia has been drawn increasingly into the tor ex of European poht.es. Neither Prance, Germany, Austria, Italy, Holland nor Belgium own possessions contiguous to the Persian dominions. Their commercial stake m the country is relatively small. Notwithstanding they find it to their interest to maintain, what are m some cases costly and extensive, diplomat establishments at Tehran, and they occupy a minor, but nevertheless a definite position upon the local diplomatic stage. It is to be surmised, therefore, that’ even had British India not existed, or had it passed into other hands, the British Government would nevertheless before now have been compelled to take an active political interest in Persian fortunes. Persia is in fact one of those countries which,, whether or not they had fallen into the orbit of Western Powers, more ^vigorous than themselves, must inevitably have attracted the attention of Purope, partly from their increasing infirmity, hut still more from the opportunities suggested by their latent, though neglected, sources of strength. The two-fold British interest and responsibility here indicated have indeed been recognised by the system, now of long standing, under which the charges of the diplomatic establishment maintained by Her Majesty’s Govern ment at Tehran are shared between the Imperial and the Indian exchequers. That such a division of common interest has become necessary, that the politics of Tehran, which with one eye turned towards India looks with the other towards St. Petersburgh and Constantinople, are hut one aspect of the eternal Eastern question, and that the control of British diplomacy at Tehran must therefore be vested in the hands of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs, are propositions which 40 years ago were hotly contested by certain schools of thought, but that will not any longer be a matter of dispute. They serve to illustrate the Imperial, as distinct from the purely Indian, character of Anglo- Persian relations. 7. The strategical interests of Great Britain in Persia arise from conditions with which India is most intimately concerned. Long before the boundaries of British India had been extended to their present limits, or before Russia had become a great Central Asian Power, approaching or impinging at many points upon the Indian frontiers, the fortunes of Persia, though not at that time a coterminous country, had become a matter of vital concern to the British dominion in India. In the early years of the present century, when the ambi tions of France were the main source of apprehension, it was through Persia that a blow at British supremacy was expected to be struck, and. that an inva sion of India was planned. The same idea has re-appeared at intervals since. How that the boundaries of Afghanistan, which have been demarcated and guaranteed by Great Britain, march for many hundreds of miles with those of Persia; that Persian territory is also coterminous for hundreds of miles with Baluchistan, a State under a British Protectorate, and in large measure actually administered by the officers of the Government of India;.and that the sea which washes the southern coasts of Persia is one in which, both from its proximity to the Indian Ocean and as a result of the exertions of the past century, Indian interests and influence have become supreme—it is clear that Persia has assumed a strategical importance, in relation to British India, which mig i no be serious, were the resources or the designs of that country itsel a one o e considered; but which is indisputably great, when it is remembered n ^ f ^ sel / f pressing upon Persia and upon Afghanistan is the ever-grown^ m a Power whose interests in Asia are not always m accord with oui^ that the Persian Gulf is beginning to attract the i^est of o supreme times rival nations. These conditions, however while they m^cate the supreme concern wdiich those who are responsible for the governm obvious in fail to feel in the fortunes of Persia, are nevertheless their general application to render it unnecessary for us io - far more than local range, or to argue that they affect no ^ It ig from of British dominion in India, but those of t ie f pp rs ia in its strategical, this point of view that we hold strongly the opinion . o olcn aT1 Tmnerial. no s point of view that we noia strong^ , Imperial, less than in its political, aspect is not only an Indian, but is also an impena ,oonoern and that we Teel no hesitation in appealing to Her Majesty’s Government for a frank and generous recognition of this common responsibility. 8 The telegraphic interests of Great Britain in Persia may be said to he evenly divided between the mother-country and India. Por whilst on the one hand the wires that have been constructed between the north-west frontier and Tehran, and which provide the earlier link in the Persian section of the main overland connection with the East, are in the hands of a Company whose domicile is in London, from Tehran onwards to the Gulf the undertaking is conducted by an establishment that is recruited and paid for by the Govern ment of India, while its head-quarters are in the India. Office _ in London. This two-fold system exists in order to maintain a connection which may be said to be equally British and Indian, since it is equally indispensable to the interests of both countries; but which also has an ulterior and wider scope, inasmuch as the Trans-Persian wires, and the sub-marine cables by which they are supplemented in the Persian Gulf, are largely utilised for the conveyance of messages between Great Britain and places lying beyond India, notably the Australasian Colonies. Prom a calculation based upon the aggregate results of the past five years, we have ascertained that no less than 30 per cent of the total traffic is of this description. Nevertheless the cost, in so far as it is borne by either Government, devolves exclusively upon the Indian, and not upon the Home, Exchequer. 9. Such are the main interests of Great Britain in Persia. It will be observed that the shares that may be claimed by the mother-country and by India in the sum total of those interests, have in the passage of time become so interwoven and fused as to render the task of separating or distinguishing them neither easy nor profitable. It may not be difficult, as we shall endeavour to argue later on, to distinguish between sources of expenditure which should more properly fall to the charge of the one or the other partner. But we maintain that enough has been said to prove that on the broad field of international policy Persia is not exclusively an Indian interest, but is emphatically an Imperial interest of Great Britain ; and that the latter should be prepared to exert her full strength for the defence of that interest, should it be jeopardised or impugned. 10. In discussing the manner in which it is desirable that these principles, if accepted, should be carried into action, we are anxious at the outset to make our position, in one respect, perfectly clear. We have no desire to make an addition to the political or territorial responsibilities of India, for which we have not, under existing conditions, the means either in money or in men. We are not about to propose that there should be established any Protectorate, open or covert, over any part of the Shah s dominions, that might compel us in the future to hold that mhH Pin 80 ^j 10 ( f eC ^ 1 J ^ ^° T rc€ i °* arms * ^ e can conceive of circumstances thkkwf'L ,!? 6 ' eml , ^ t le ! udiau and thc Home Governments from Ermine were if 'I wou ^ 1,1 a case where the vital interests of the are still nnnrennr^ 6 ’ifff US + i t0 consll ! er a burden for which our shoulders to makirm sdre il or ,J bc ]ri'esent. our ambitions arc exclusively limited to n“ ventlf it foi lr 1? ereSt a Wlll ? h 7° have alread y built up, and still more result not onfv of Too U m enmned - or taken from us by others, with the detriment to^ulkr^ f f-T’ P 0siti - status auo in Persia •/ ’ v 111 n ? c ^ esir c to disturb the political as it is to invest it with H ^ 1 Can maintained.

Russian territory also overlaps the north-east corner of the Persian dominions. Great Britain enioys a some- what similar preponderance of influence on the south, by virtue of her hitherto unchallenged supremacy, both naval and commercial, in the Persian Gulf • while, owing to recent developments on the side of Baluchistan, her land territories also touch those of Persia upon the south-east. But there are these broad differences between the two positions: firstly, that whereas the Russian territories tlmt are limitroplie with. Persia on the north are continuous either with those of Euiopeanor with those of Asiatic Russia, the immense resources of. both of which dominions can be brought by a skilfully designed system of railways, and deposited with little trouble and with no delay, upon the Persian frontier itself the forces of Great Britain, if required for purposes either of menace or attack, would require to be conveyed by sea and would be separated by a great distance from their base; the land connection on the Perso-Baluch side being as yet too precarious and remote to admit of its being taken into serious consideration in the present context; secondly, that whereas the Russian land approaches upon the north are in her own exclusive possession, the maritime access of Great Britain on the south is equally open to any other Power possessing a naval marine. Hence the marked and inevitable distinction between the power of persuasion or menace possessed by Russia in the north, as compared with that at the disposal of Great Britain in the south, the advantage enjoyed by the former being enhanced by the fact that the Persian capital and Court are situated in the northern or Russian and not in the southern or British zone of influence. 13. In these circumstances it is not surprising to read of the increasing and indisputable supremacy which Russia has established in Northern Persia, as described by Sir M. Durand. While not repeating his demonstration, we may sujiplement it by saying that, while we think that no efforts should be spared to safeguard so much as is left to us of the trade that enters the country by the Trebizond-Tabriz route, of the trade of Tehran, and of that of North- East Persia (concerning which it may be noted that the imports into Meshed from British India which in 1893-94 represented a value of £198,500 and in 1894-95 of £312,000, have in 1897-98 sunk to £130,000), and while as long as the capital remains at Tehran, which is also the centre of important British interests in the shape of the Telegraph administration and the Imperial Bank of Persia, it is essential that British influence there , should be asserted on a scale as nearly as possible equivalent to that of Russia we are ye of opinion that the advantages enjoyed by Russia in the field under discussion are so over whelming as to render any attempt to dispute or to shake her pcsition there fruitless f and that our own energies can with greater wisdom and with superior chances of success be directed towards the protection and consolidation of theBritish sphere of influence in the centre and south. It is to a more critical examination of this subject that we now turn. 14 Sir M. Durand has in his despatch drawn a line across Persia from Khanikin on the Turkish frontier on the west, through Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd and Kerman to Seistan and the Afghan frontier on the east, as indicating approximately the existing line of partition between the British and Russian spheres of influence both political and commercial in Persia. 15. Polio wing the same order from the west, we concur with what he has written about tbe importance of fostering the Baghdad trade route via Kerman shah to Tehran, British commerce by which approaches in value to £1,000,000 per annum. This is a route of peculiar value both to British and to Indian trade, and one upon which we should on no account forfeit the supremacy. We have no hesitation in recommending, with Sir M. Durand, the substitution of a British Vice-Consul at Kermanshah for the present native agent: although we think that the cost of the proposed appointment which lies outside of what may be called the more strictly Indian zone, and which will be subordinate to the Consulate-General at Tehran, should be borne by Imperial and not by Indian revenues. 16. Whatever be the prospects of opening up, either by road or by railway (and concerning the latter we are sceptical), the country that lies northward of the Karun River, and that is inhabited by the Lurs and other nomad tribes, it is certain that British influence has obtained a material foothold in that corner of the Shah’s dominions, through which the Karun flows in its middle and lower course, and where the road now being constructed through the Bakhtiari country, by contract between the Bakhtiari Chiefs and Messrs. Lynch, should open an alternative and almost exclusively British door of commercial access to Ispahan. We do not express any opinion as to the ideas which Sir M. Durand has more than once put forward as to the desirability of raising a local irregular force under British officers from the tribes in this part of Persia. Such a scheme would appear to postulate a firmer and more permanent footing than we have as yet established in South-West Persia. Nevertheless we think that no opportunity should be lost of strengthening our influence with the Arab, Bakhtiari and Lur tribes—an effort to challenge which from a rival quarter appears likely before long to be made—and we concur in Sir M. Durand’s recommendations as to tbe desirability of establishing a Consulate on the Karun, reserving for a subsequent paragraph our opinion as to the proper incidence of the cost. n , o ^ O wo liclVtJ UUbllA/U IIULLL tilt?

T IfT recel I ed by ' s - Sir M ‘ V™™* 1 now proposes that this Consulate should be made permanent, and that possibly a native agent under its orders should be sent to Bampur. Before discussinp* these pro- posais, we think it advisable to analyse the larger issues raised by the questions or Seistan and the Persian Gulf. 20. Concerning Seistan, its importance and the present position there, we refer Yonr Lordship to a Minute which has been written by the Viceroy, who has made a special study of the question, and which is enclosed with this despatch. The facts enumerated by him are, we think, sufficient to show that Seistan is, by reason of its geographical position in relation both to North Khorasan, to Western Afghanistan, to British Baluchistan, and to the Persian Gulf, a position of no small strategical importance. Seistan is the present meeting point of the advanced pioneers of British and Russian influence. Perhaps on the whole, owing to recent activity on our part, the British position and chances are the*more hopeful. It is essential in the future, for reasons which have been argued in the Viceroy’s Minute, that Seistan should he retained in the British zone. It is fortunately not too late to secure that consummation. The steps which should be taken with that object will he examined when we formulate our final recommendations at the close of this despatch. 21. South of Seistan lies the still imperfectly known district of Persian Baluchistan. Every year this province is being brought into closer contact with British associations, partly from the visits of British officers, partly from the wide-spreading influence exercised by the Nnshki-Seistan Trade route, still more from the close connections, political and racial, prevailing between the inhabitants of the two sides of the Perso-Baluch border—a condition of affairs which is likely to he confirmed by the inevitable increase of British influence in the dominions of the Khan of Kalat.[ § ] 22. unr msuuutiuu wo. , described as the British sphere, has now hroug — — * r.- ~^ sSt which-no doubt from its more e S elu Sl yely Indian aspect and bearing- Ins only been lightly touched upon by Sir M. Durand but upon which it is we should address Tour Lordship at greater length, go The de jure position in the Persian Gulf is that of a sea open to the flag ofallnations, the northern shores and territorial waters of which are included in the dominions of Persia, while its west^ Our inspection of the various sub-areas composing what we have iu. has now brought us to the Persian Gulf—a sort of veiled Protectorate, vnuxx !&gt; t • i t» -i- C owned either by Persia, or by Arab Chiefs (m the case of Bahrein under British protection)- hut upon one of the Persian Islands, viz., Kishm, Great Britain pos sesses a piece of land by virtue of an original grant from the Imam of Maskat, to whom the island once belonged. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, hut included in the same political system, are, on the northern shore of the Arabian Sea, the coasts of Persian Baluchistan, along which the overland wires of the Indo-European Telegraph Company run as far as Jask, where a reserve of English territory exists under an agreement concluded in 1887 between the British and Persian Governments, and where a detachment of Indian troops, who had previously been stationed there between the years 1879 and 1887, was replaced in January 1898 in consequence of the murder of a British telegraph official and the disturbed state of Persian Baluchistan. A larger detachment was at the same time despatched to Charbar, near the eastern limits of the same province. On the southern and western coasts is the still independent kingdom or Sultanate of Oman (Maskat). 21. The de facto position upon the waters and on the shores of the Persian Gulf reflects a more positive British predominance than the preceding paragraph might indicate. In the early years of the present century, the slave trade was rampant in the Gulf, and the vessels of the Indian Marine were engaged in a long and arduous straggle with the Arab pirates who infested its southern coasts. This conflict which was conducted entirely by British agency and means, without any help from the Persian Government, resulted in the establish ment of treaty relations with the great majority of the Arab Chiefs, under which they bound themselves to observe perpetual peace and to refer all disputes to the British Resident at Bushire. The pax Britannica, which has ever since, with rare exceptions, been maintained, is the issue of these arrange ments and is the exclusive work of this country. Of similar origin were the soundings of the channels and. the surveys of the shores of the Persian Gulf, which the navigators of all nations owe to the labours of a long line of naval officers of the Indian service. Meanwhile, British trade has acquired almost a monopoly of the foreign commerce of the Gulf ports. Indian Bunias from Shikarpur and other parts of Sind have settled in considerable numbers at inga , Bunder Abbas, Bushire and Bahrein. They frequently farm the customs. The foreign imports and exports pass through their hands. These are for the most part conveyed to and from the Gulf in British ships, more than one • ?Tn y ( - lle “Msh India’, the ‘ Bombay and Persia’, and the An 0 lo-Arabian and Persian Gulf ) having maintained for years a merchant waTwhiisTthe^vT 611 I ) ;aracl “ Basrah, touching at the Gulf ports on the ay, -nhilst the iival ventures that have occasionally been attempted bv foreien nations have uniformly failed and have been withdrawn Mlemptea Dy lorelgn £17,241,300 e (atthe rateof*Rs^Sfl^oT this* totaTl! ^l t° d ? mounted /a aaewitn -British possesses (including India) amounted to £9,709,500,[ 9 ] « I ZlZ Slfte“Lh E :S S 6 ', — ^ee years, 2,039 were British, and their tonnaw ren^tnf /L clea «d from the Gulf ports If the returns of Persian ports alone hp ^ ^ ?, er ° ent of the total tonnage. £11,172,000, of which loca! trade - ITjno^ 6 YV are Tota l «e £9,002,600, the British proportion • and Eternal trade = cent.

Latterly there has been a deliberate but necessary con solidation of our influence in certain quarters where trouble threatened or where rivalry was feared. At the north-west extremity of the Gulf, we have, under instructions from Her Majesty ’s Government, entered into engagements with the s ill independent Sheikh of Lowed, by which he has bound himself and his successors not to receive the representative of any other Power and not to alienate any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power a proceeding which was dictated by the increasing encroachment of Turkish authority and by the incipient intrigues of other Powers. Similar machinations are known to be in progress at Bahrein, and will require to he counteracted by a more strict enforcement of the conditions to which the Sheikh is by treaty bound. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but included within the sphere of its political influence, the Arab State of Maskat has for years been controlled by British influence; its trade is similarly in Anglo- Indian hands; and its ruler has not merely for years been subsidised by the Government of India, hut in 1891 entered into an Agreement with us, under the orders of Her Majesty’s Government, not to alienate any j&gt;ortion of his dominions to any other Power. 27. Such, briefly summarised, is the position that has been won by Great Britain, not without the expenditure of many millions of money and the sacrifice of many valuable lives, in the Persian Gulf. In its vindication we have more than once been called upon to enter into military occupation of ports or islands in the Gulf. The island of Kharak was occupied by Indian forces from 1838 to 1842, and again in 1856-57. Bushire was held during the latter years, me evidences ui wmou. 28 Sir M. Durand has in general terms described the commanding posi tion which the proximity of the Trans-Caspian Railway and of her Central Asian namsons the construction of the Ashkahad-ICuchan-Meshed cart-ioad, and the annual expenditure of large sums of money, have enabled Russia to take up m the polities and commerce of the province of Khorasan. M e proceed to develop the argument by showing how the Khorasan position has been and is being utilised as the base of a further and more southerly advance. 2 q it was in 1889 that the campaign of what may he termed the Russi fication of Khorasan was opened with the appointment of _ a Russian Consu - General at Meshed. In 1891 a native trader, named Hap Agha, appeared as •2 37::«vr t •'* u [ 10 ] News-agent at Bixjand; and a Klian, who nac ialven into emi3loy, had in Seistan. In the succeeding years &gt; - i r i- Tiflis were busily at work surveying the country m a southerly direction, as far as the borders of Persia and Baluchistan. In 1S95 a more direct blow at the large Anglo-Indian trade which at that time still made its way through Khorasan into the Russian possessions m Central Asia was struck by he in roduction of a Customs Tariff in Trans-Caspia, absolutely prohibiting the entry into the Russian territories of all British or Indian products except indigo, tea and muslin, and these only under a heavy duty. In the same year’ M. Zaroudny, a Russian politico-geologist, Anglice surveyor, paid his first visit to Kain and Seistan. Russian News-agents were also placed at I abbas and Neh, as well as at Birjand and Nasirabad. 30. In the meantime, in the latter part of 1896, the Government of India had decided upon taking active measures to open the long closed trading route from Quetta to Seistan. These intentions, and the prospective British interest in Seistan to which they testified, excited much concern in Russia ; and in the following year the outbreak of plague in India ofieied to the Russian authorities a welcome opportunity of, at the same time, endeavouring to strangle the new enterprise at its birth, and increasing their own influence in Seistan. Under the pretext of establishing a protective cordon to safeguard the Perso-Afghan frontier in Persian interests from a disease which existed neither in Baluchistan nor in Afghanistan, Russian Cossacks under Russian officers were planted at a number of places in Persian territory, where they turned back every caravan (ignoring an agreement that had been arrived at between Great Britain and Persia for a 10 days quarantine upon caravans arriving from infected countries), declined to accept any orders except those which came directly from the Russian Legation, and for a time absolutely closed the Herat-Meshed road, in spite of orders to the contrary from the Persian Government—the object of this measure being to divert Afghan trade from Meshed to Panjdeh and Merv in Russian territory. It was significant that upon crossing the Russian frontier the caravans, which had been refused passage through Persia under any condi tions, were only detained for three days in quarantine. The Persian 'Govern ment, after a feeble protest, acquiesced' in these proceedings; and it may almost be said that Southern Khorasan passed for a time under Russian control. 31. It was with the object of anticipating a similar Russian intervention in Seistan that, in the spring of 1897, the Government of India despatched Singeon-Major Brazier-Creagh to superintend any preventive measures that might be required in that district. Already Lieutenant Webb Ware, who had visited Seistan in March, in connection with 'the trade route, had reported : k ‘ I was disagreeably astonished to find what ascendency Russia had gained through out Seistan Major Brazier-Creagh, a few months later, wrote : “ I was by no means surprised to find what ascendency the Russians had gained in the ./l 1 ® P as t four years Russian activity has been very manifest. to Mp«hPfl llI Nr 6 ° . &lt; ? ls ^ an ’ 1 311 ^ extends all along the Perso-Afghan frontier up centres mz ^ wn a » ents ^eing established at all the important trade centres, viz., Neh, Birjand, Tabbas, Khaf, and Turbat-i-Haidari the Persian ^uthoritiS^f^in 118 !, 121 ^ 6 officer were ignored by Russian doctor fMilnrl ^ n °^ ^f 11 ^ 0n ° when the expected iiussian cloctoi (Miladchevsky by name), with an escort of eight Cossacks appeared _ upon the scene, a detachment of ten Cossacks under a Russian SoMu S nctoUn°f Sted at , TUrbaW - Haidari ’ 80 south of Meshed a to or from Seistan.

A more active assertion ot the same pretensions has since been witnessed in the mt “n of af Ji t ?( o ’ t n r t a if p °p aT1 - t0 ^ ^^au Consulate at Meshed, with presents valued at £1,400, to the Persian Governor of Earn, who is brother to the Governor of Seistan and is believed to covet the succession to that post. The sanitary plea was also advanced m the course of the past summer to explain the despatch of Russian dectors to Iierman and even to Shiraz. An interesting commentarv upon these proceedings may he found in an observation in Lieutenant Webb Ware’s report upon the Quetta-Seislan trade route for 1897-98, where he savs that “ the chief hindrance to the further development of this route is to he foudd in the obstructive measures taken by the Russian officers striving to further the interests of that country at the expense of India”. 3L The facts which we have enumerated will, we think, be sufficient to convince Your Lordship of two propositions: firstly, that Russia regards with unconcealed aversion the opening of the British commercial route from India to Seistan and Khorasan, and will spare no efforts to rob it of success; secondly, that she regards with an interested eye the future of Seistan itself, and is already preparing, by a display of armed force and by the assumption of executive authority, to pave the way for an eventual inclusion within the Russian sphere of that portion of the Shah’s dominions. 35. In the same context, and as illustrating the political and strategical abject which such an advance may be believed to have in view, it will not oe forgotten that during the past few years, the Russian Government have constructed a railway from Merv to Kushk upon the Afghan frontier within 80 miles of Herat, and have stacked at the terminus the railway plant for a future extension to Herat itself. Should any doubt he entertained as to tin purpose for which this extension (which is destitute of any commercial justifi cation) was planned, it m— 1 ^ « wUWr,™ made to Sir N. O’Conor by 1898, that it was designed “ complications wuth England ” can onlv he made in I l xi. 1 ICAJ \ \J O tt; U V 1 /JLXJ.X x_i. ^ ^ j Herat itself. Should any doubt he entertained as to the purpose for which this extension (which is destitute of any commercial justifi cation) was planned, it may be solved by a reference to the frank admission made to Sir N. O’Conor by M. deWitte, Russian Minister of Einance, in June ' ‘ ’ to enable Russia to attack Afghanistan in case of When it is remembered that such an attack vclJA v , ljLiy ^ ^ direct violation of solemn international engagements, it is not, we think, incumbent upon us to argue at further length that the political ambitions of Russia in Eastern Persia, and in close proximity to the Atg lan border, have an ulterior significance which it would be folly to ignore. divorce these proceedings from the idea that, m seeking P 1 • ... •„ Cl „ non’ o ia n rvf TY1 PT»pl V ClldCUVOUfing 36.

Durand has recently infoimed us by telegraph that the corps of so-called Persian Cossacks S Tehran (i.e„ Persian soldiem trained and commanded by Kussian officers) has been raised from 1,000 to 1,500 men, and that detachments of tins corps hare for the first time been taken with them to the south by the Goyernors of Shiraz and Arabistan, Por the present the Russian officers haye stayed behind ; but it is not difficult to imagine the circumstances in which they might claim to rejoin their regiments. In 1897, M. Krugelow was sent from Jerusalem as Russian Consul to Baghdad, with the special object of reporting upon the acquisition by Russia of a coaling station m the Persian Gulf. This gentleman has taken much interest in Koweit, where Russian emissaries from Baghdad have been residing continuously during the present year. In this context it will not be forgotten that the concession recently sought for with the aid ot the Russian Embassy at Constantinople by Count Kapnist, a Russian of high rank, for a railway from Tripoli in Syria to the Persian Gulf contemplated a terminus at Koweit. 38. In Rushire and Bunder Abbas the Russians have lately developed a marked interest. Two Russian doctors (Drs. Marc and Oust) arrived at Bushire in 1897 for the now familiar purpose of studying the plague, which, however, did not make its appearance until two years later, in 1899. Dr. Marc in 1897 occupied his waiting hours in visiting Bunder Abbas, from whence he was in the habit of despatching official reports to his Government, and where he magnanimously treated all patients free of charge. His medical pursuits at this place were assisted by a third Russian, named Adamoff, who appears to have been an artillery officer, and who subsequently visited Busbire and Basrah. In 1898 two other Russian doctors, named Rodzewitz and Kornajevski, appeared upon the scene, and visited Basrah, Bushire and Bunder Abbas. In December 1898 a fifth Russian doctor, named Pasclikowski, arrived in the Gulf, and did not fail to pay the regulation visit to Bunder Abbas; while he displayed a considerable professional activity during the recent outbreak of plague at Bushire, where he has announced that, upon his approaching return to Russia, he is to be replaced by two compatriots. In connection with this medical propaganda, it will he in Your Lordship’s recollection that when the first rumours were circulated of plague at Bushire in the past summer, the Kussian Legation at lehran at once announced their intention of sending doctors, with Cossack escorts, to Bushire as well as Shiraz, in order to establish a plague cordon for the protection of those places from the Indian pestilence, and that Russian doctors took up their quarters both at Shiraz and Kerman. lese precautions might he thought to indicate a praiseworthy desire to close every conceivable channel of entry into Asiatic Russia against the plague, were they not, as has already been shown, in striking contrast with the laxity of system, that is at the same time observed both on the Perso-Russian and on the Russo-Afghan frontiers, across which alone can plague succeed in entering the Russian dominions. In continuation of our story it may be mentioned fA a i R l 1 f, lan offi 1 ce , r Vlslted and surveyed the island of Hormuz pjiosite to Bunder Abbas, and that other and non-medical Russian emissaries! ■ have a1 s° recentJy been heard of at the latter place (the two latest \r i ■+ chielf and Baron de Schedenore, a S lately as August in the piesent ye^ t should not, moreover he forgotten that it was Russian opposition that in 1898 hrolce down the loan to the Persian Government from the Imperial Bank of Persia, the security ot which was to be the customs of the southern norts to be collected by agents of the Bank. 61 n P orts ’ 39 * , aw f e ih *\ «n April 18tli of the present year, with reference to reports that have been published of Bussian designs upon the island of Kishm adjoining Hormuz, Count Mouravieff assured Sir C. Scott, Her MaiestvN Ambassador at St. Petersbnrgh, that “there was absolutely no intention on the Russian Government to add to the burden of their existing resnon sibilities by acquiring outlying ports or stations which would require naval defence m time _ of war ” ; and we do not doubt that this emphatic assurance represents the views sincerely entertained by the Emperor of Russia. But our faith m the value of this assurance has been somewhat shaken by the later information received from a Persian official of high rank and station, known personally to the Viceroy, to the effect that he believes Russia to have acquired certain rights m regard to a port in the Persian Gulf, which however it may not suit her at once to enforce. Moreover there is in practice a limit to the duration of all such pledges, which, even if given by the sovereign, are not always regarded as binding by his officials; and previous experience is not altogether encouraging to the belief in a prolonged existence of the present undertaking, should circumstances compel an opposite course. There are more over other means, well-known to Her Majesty’s Government from recent experience in other parts of the world, of obtaining political and territorial influence, independently of the actual acquisition of harbours or stations. 40. It is, in onr opinion, more than a coincidence that simultaneously with the increasing Russian interest in Central and Southern Persia which we have described, there should also have been a notable revival of Erench activity in those quarters. In 1896 the Messageries Maritimes Company commenced a subsidised service from Bombay to the ports of the Persian Gulf; although, owing to vessels of unsuitable draught having been employed, the enterprise was not a success and was shortly abandoned. In 1897 a Erench Vice-Consul (M. Eerrand) was for the first time appointed at Bushire, although the value of Erench trade with the Persian Gulf in that year amounted only to the modest total of £82,618 (of which £73,899 was sugar). He was succeeded in 1898 by M. Bryois, who recently informed the agent of one of the British Trading Companies at Bushire that the Erench Government intended shortly to establish a subsidised line of steamers to Mohammerah and the Karun. It was perhaps in connection with this project that in March 1899, M. Bryois paid a visit to the Karun, where a Erench scientific party, under M. de Morgan, has for some time been engaged in politico-archaeological researches in Arabistan- Mhen the 1 rench Chaige d’Affaires, Comte d’Arlot, recently visited Ispahan, the Zibes-Sultan vouch safed the corroborative information to the B ritish Legation that the object of these movements on the part of the Erench was to obtain a footing at Mohammerah Shnshter and Dizful. Luring our recent negotiations with the Sheikh ol Koweit about the future of that harbour, it was with some surprise that we learned from him that the Erench had already approached him on the subject. In Bahrein a so-called French merchant, M. Goguyer, who until recently was engaged m Maskat in an attempt to revive the traffic in arms under the Irench flag, has been reported as endeavouring to induce the inhabitants to purchase French protec tion bv the payment of small sums. In 1899 a French Consular Agency was established at Lingah, where the ^me “pmous system o^ manufactunn Erench subjects (for the most successful illustration of which we must look SiTm) was started, and where the French flag was hmsted by ^ the Erench Vice-Consul at Bushire. Emally, Her Majesty s Governmem are “aware than ourselves of the recent negotiations f a French lof to the Persian Government upon the security of the customs of the bull ports, and promise of a railway monopoly in that coun ly.• x x fUp Ppr^ian Gulf, either political or comraercial, 41.

This policy has been foreshadowed by the utjiguuu xa x^ A n Vinwc nwmno* a llfiffianeft to the Sultan free grant of the Erench flag to Arab dhows, owning allegiance to the Snltan of M 8 aTkaVandis^facilitated by the influence over the latter petty potentate that has been acquired by the Erench Vice-Consul whose anti-Bntish inclina tions and intrigues are so well known to Her Majesty s Government as to require no recapitulation here. Confirmation of our suspicions regarding a Eranco-Bussian entente in Persia and in the Persian Gulf is further afforded by a telegram, dated June 7th, *1899, from Sir M. Durand to Colonel Meade, which has already been communicated both to Your Lordship and to the Foreign Office, and in which Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran remarks : “ You may he quite certain thnt Russia and 1 ranee aie woiking in unison 42. It should he noted that in the recent papers, with copies of which _we have been favoured by Her Majesty’s Government, we have found a repudiation of Erench ambitions in the quarter under discussion, no less explicit than that which we have already quoted from the lips of Count Mouravieff. On July 19th, 1899, M. Cambon said to Lord Salisbury that “ France had no political aspiration whatever in the Persian Gulf ; that she did not desire any kind of fortification or settlement or political privileges, or anything beyond the maintenance of those rights already insured to her by treaty We have been gratified to read this assurance, by which we hope that succeeding French ministries may hold themselves hound. But we regret that it has not been communicated, not merely to Her Majesty’s Government, but also to the French Agents in those regions, who do not appear to he equally acquainted with the views of the Government that they serve. 43. In recent years Germany has begun to display a positive and an increasing interest in Persia and also in the Persian Gulf. This interest has been the historical, and perhaps the natural, sequel of a commercial policy that has for some time aimed at securing the control of the principal railways in the Turkish dominions in Asia Minor, and of a political ambition, that more recently still, would appear to aim at the protection of the Ottoman Empire, alike in Europe and Asia. The obvious corollary to a system of German railways in Asia Minor, would he similar railroads to the Persian border and through Mesopotamia to the Persiau Gulf. Already, as Sir M. Durand has in formed the Eoreign Office, the Germans have procured a concession for the construction of a road from Khanikin, on the Turko-Persian frontier, to Tehran, and have apparently only abstained from pressing for a railroad in the same quarter, because of the violent opposition with which the Russian Minister met the proposal at Tehran.

We have gathered together these symptoms of external, and notably of Russian or of Russophil, interest in Southern Persia and in the Persian Gulf, not because we desire to invest them individually with an importance to which they are not entitled, but because collectively they indicate, in a manner that is not open to misinterpretation, the policy and ambitions of foreign Powers, and because we desire to impress upon Her Majesty’s Government the fact that in an area, by land and by sea, which Great Britain regards with good reason as falling within her sphere of influence, that influence is being directly and increasingly challenged by other nations, who, in proportion as their foothold becomes more securely established, will resist any preferential claims, upon what ever foundation in history or in fact they may rest, and will claim for themselves an equality of right which in theory it may he difficult to contest. 48. More particularly do these considerations apply to the case of Russia, whose advance across the deserts that form a natural harrier of division between Northern and Southern Persia, cannot be regarded with anything hut uneasiness by the Government of India, and the appearance of whose flag in the Persian Gulf would import a novel element of unrest into a situation that is at no time without its anxious features. We desire deliberately to say toni'.w'J Ty^ [ 16 ] Your Lordship, meS that difficult as we find existing circu proximity of Russian military strain imposed upo J we stem frontiers of India from the Pamirs power upon the ^ rt ^ ie t rn ^ empla t e without dismay the prospect of Russian to Herat, we could not co P lt i iern p ers i aj the inevitable consequence of neighbourhood m Eastern own p-ardens; while the maritime which must be a great inci ^ ^ pe altogether reconsidered, were the defensibihty of India w M ^ lemented b tlle - appearance of a possible ;:SiS»&gt;» mi-•‘™-, n ‘ 9 . w. —• rts ■Rnm-nean Power, and if so which, will at any rimu ^ . noTnt of claiming a maritime outlet in or near to the Persian Gulf.

Such a consummation, it is m our opinion, in the iffierests of British policy, as long as may be possible, to postpone But upon the question of allowing any European Power, and more especially Russia, to overrun Central and Southern Persia and so to reach the Gulf or to acquire naval facilities in the latter even without such territorial connections, we do not conceive that any doubt whatever can be entertained; and we imagine that it will be accepted as a cardinal axiom of ? British policy that no such development would be acquiesced m by Her Majesty s_ Government. We would arrive with the greater confidence at this conclusion, since we were lately informed by Your Lordship that on April 15th of the present year, Lord Salisbury communicated to the Persian Government with reference to rumours of the cession of a port in the Gulf to Russia, that “ Her Majesty’s Government felt it to be their duty to renew the intimation that it would not be compatible with the interests of the British Empire that any European Power should exercise control or jurisdiction over the jiorts of the Persian Gulf”. 50. Such being the existing situation in Southern Persia, and the prin ciples of policy accepted by Her Majesty’s Government being as already stated, we pass to a consideration of the manner in which these principles should be translated into action, and of the steps which should, in our opinion, be taken at the present juncture for the protection of the common interests of Great Britain and the Indian Empire. 51. We are aware that, more than half a century ago, there were exchanged, and have more than once since been repeated, certain explicit assurances concerning the integrity and independence of Persia between the Governments of Great Britain and Russia. The first of these assurances were entered into by Lord Palmerston and Count Nesselrode. The former in a despatch, dated September 5th, 1834, placed on record that “ the Governments of Great Britain and Russia are acting, with regard to the affairs of Persia in the same spirit, and are equally animated by a sincere desire to maintain, not only, the internal tranquillity, but also the independence and integrity of Persia ”. Count Nesselrode, in despatches, dated October 20th, 1838, and January 29th, 1839, reiterated these pledges on behalf of his Government. Again in 1873 the continued existence of these mutual assurances was referred to with satisfaction by Count de Brunnow, as reported in a despatch by Lord Granville, dated July 10th, 1873. Einally, on March 12th, 1888, M. de Giers intimated, through M. de Staal, to Lord Salisbury that the Russian Government . fi ave 110 objection to placing again on record that their views on this point are in no way altered ’; and a communication to the effect that the engagements between Great Britain and Russia to respect and promote the integrity and independence of the Persian kingdom had again been renewed and confirmed, was accordingly made by Sir H. D. Wolff to the Shah. .Whilst it may be presumed that these pledges, so frequently renewed, are still m existence, and while we have no desire to infer that they are[ 17 ] within measurable distance of lWn&gt; they are in themselves quite insufficient ’ W f +1 f re of option that Kussian influence in P^rTor P^e SS of interests in it, from the limits of a nominally stil^^xis^n^ffitc^rhv C ‘in d( l SC1 ' 1 Wit]lin the encroachments upon both those attributes are po^ible TlnTh S f 0 . man y alter they have been contemptuously ignored by statesmen J ’ 1 S o3. If tins proposition be accepted, and if we cannot rely unon written pledges to safeguard t ie future of Persia, it behoves us to examine the va ous alternative policies that have been or can be proposed. The first of th“ the policy of a regeneration of Persia by Anglo-Itussian means L ioint action by Great Britain and Russia to insist upon reforms, to reorganise the administration and finances, to develop the resources of he count?y“ o lend the requisite means, in fact to convert the Persian Government by cmnb ned philanthropy from a moribund into a solvent institution. This policy was dfs- cussed and rejected by Sir M. Durand in his Memorandum of September 1895 on the ground that Russia would denounce us to the Shah to begin with, and would play us false afterwards; and in bis despatch of February 1899 he again “ proceeds upon the assumption that we cannot hope to come to terms with Fussia, and persuade her to join us in a policy of reform and development ” He concur with Her Majesty’s Minister in believing that the reform of Persia by a policy of friendly co-operation between Russia and ourselves is out of the question; and we do so in the main for the reason, which no one familiar with Persia will deny, that Russia is interested not in the reform of Persia, but in its decay; that in the background of her ambitions is the vision of a country and a people. falling from inherent debility into her grasp; and that any policy which might tend to strengthen the country or to revivify the people, is to he resisted as tending to thwart the fulfilment of those ambi- tions.. We might give many illustrations in support of this proposition; hut we will content ourselves with one. Sir M. Durand has lately supplied to the Foreign Office the version given by the Sadr Azam of the agreement between the Persian and Russian Governments, by which the former bound itself in 1889 not to grant any railway concessions to any other Power than Russia, except with the consent of the latter, for a period of 10 years. Whatever be the real facts of the case, there can he no doubt that this engagement, as long as it has lasted, and so long as it continues to last, is an effective barrier to any genuine development of the country. It was due to expire in the present year. Our latest information from Sir M. Durand is that it has, under pressure from the Russian Government, been renewed for another term of five years. 54. The alternative policy recommended by Sir M. Durand is that we should plainly intimate that any Russian encroachments in Northern Persia will provoke corresponding measures for the protection of British interests in the south. In his Memorandum of September 1895, Her Majesty’s Minister suggested that this declaration should be made to the Russian Government. ' In his despatch of February 1899 he proposed that it should also be made to the Persian Government; so that both parties should be well aware of the steps that would follow upon any further Russian aggression. It has been objected to this policy that such an engagement might impose upon the British Govern ment an unwelcome obligation to intervene and to add to British responsibi lities in Southern Persia, at the moment most opportune to Russia, and least opportune to ourselves. There is iorce in this objection; although we think that it might he met by introducing sufficient elasticity into the proposed intimation to leave Her Majesty’s Government free to act for the protection of British interests in Southern Persia, not in a specified manner at a specified moment, but in what manner and at what juncture might commend itself to their judgment. Moreover the value of the objection is somewhat weakened bv the consideration that did Russia take any such step m Northern Persia as is here contemplated, counter-action of some sort, with or without a previouswhile the knowledge that a ^^“^“Xwould^it can scarcely be doubted, rs»*iftis7r35 #«»„«■. '-““i,' 1 ““ *— '• ultimate access to Southern Persia and the Persian Gi . K K 'NTcvcrlbeless before we recommend that such a policy should be essayed we desire to raise the question whether though it be impossible to conclude an agreement with Russia for the joint patronage and development of PCTsia it might not yet be possible to come to an understanding with her for the separate patronage and development of that country m distinct and clearly defined compartments by the two great Powers, in other words for a recognition of British and Russian spheres of interest m the dominions of the bhah. lbs is a solution the desirability of which has not been lost sight of by Sn M. Durand, but which for certain reasons he did not eel called upon to discuss Recent events in China have familiarised the pub ic mind with the idea of such spheres of interest, although their existence would appear to be still somewhat lacking both in clearness of definition and m precision of outline. Ihe Vmeroy has observed in recent telegrams from Lord Salisbury to Sir M. Durand with reference to a Persian loan and to mining concessions m that country, indicatious of a willingness to concede to Russia liberties m the north or 1 eisia, parallel in scope and substance with those conceded to Great Britain m the south; and it is worthy of consideration whether in an expansion of this sn°’ 0&gt; estion might not he found a feasible scheme. 56. We have already alluded to the line across Persia drawn by Sir M. Durand from Khanikin on the Turkish frontier, through Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman to Seistan, as indicating the northern limits of the sphere within which British political influence and trade are paramount. To some extent this partition is assisted by geographical conditions, the great deserts of Central Persia constituting a natural barrier between the north and the south, and roughly dividing the one from the other. But this situation is modified both in the west of Persia, where there are no deserts, and w T here there is no physical line of demarcation between the respective spheres of influence; in the centre of Persia, where Ispahan can hardly he said to constitute the natural frontier of any geographical zone; and also in the extreme east where Seistan, the inclusion of which in the British sphere would he an obligatory point, lies not to the south but to the north of the great desert. These con siderations might not affect the suecess of any engagement that was carried out with equal bona fides by both parties : but they might become a fruitful source of friction were such a good understanding not to he counted upon in the future. In any case, we would recommend that the line of partition, suggested by Sir M. Durand, should he so far amended as to substitute Kashan for Ispahan. It would be undesirable that any Russian railway should penetrate further south than Kashan, which indeed is separated by a considerable range of hills from Ispahan, or that Russia should have right of access to the very fringe of the latter district. 57. We have observed that in China the Agreement recently concluded between Her Majesty’s Government and Russia as to spheres of interest has related to railways only. Either party has pledged itself not to seek on its own account or on behalf of others for railway concessions in the rival sphere,, and not to obstruct, directly or indirectly, applications for such concessions, supported by the other in that sphere. JPrima facie there does not appear to he any reason why such an agreement should not equally he extended to mines, roads, and other industrial or economic undertakings. The value of such an understanding is considerable; because although political influence is not expressly mentioned, yet in eastern countries commercial and industrial enterprises are the familiar agencies through which political influence is exercised by alien powers, and because that influence is apt to follow in the w r ake of rail vi ays and trade. Me do not think, if such an agreement were arrived at witht 19 ] StatldHn^^ “ 01 ' tl ! «outh of the Persia or m the Persian GrQf Such a result r^Z 1 ^ “ South ^ engagement that no nolitical infli,An„o .=' &gt; pcrhiips, ensue from an on ;agement that no political influence should be eZrcisXbv eXr f the opposite side of the line. But there would be maSes[dTfficultfes1n arnvmg at any such understanding; since it would be out of the ques on n remove the British representatives, either at Tehran, at Tabriz, or at Meshed whose functions necessarily inwo ve the exercise of some sort of poliS influence, while a corresponding objection would no doubt be felt by the RussSn Government. But even an engagement limited to railway and 7 commerce expionation would have this effect, that it would deprive Russia of the mc” v which political or territorial ambitions in the rival sphere could most easily be carried out, and would render it difficult for her to push them to success as long as Great Britain remained on the alert. 58 There are however difficulties and drawbacks in the case of such an understanding which it would be impolitic to ignore. We have already hinted at one of their number. The facts with reference to Seistan which have been mentioned by the Viceroy m his Minute, by Sir M. Durand, and also in this despatch, indicate the absolute necessity of including that district within the British sphere. Nevertheless Seistan is physically and administratively a part of the province of Khorasan, from which it is 'severed by no clear' line of division, the Governorship of Seistan being vested in a member of the old ruling family of Ivain, tne tw~o existing heads of which are brothers, residing respectively at Tabbas and Birjand. It also seems exceedingly doubtful to us whether Russia would, by any such agreement as we are discussing, forego her designs, upon Seistan itself, and still more her chances of reaching the eastern extremity of the Persian Gulf. Nor again is it clear that she would be willing to cancel the engagement with regard to railway construction, which she has recently renewed with the Persian Government, and to hand over the southern half of Persia to possible railway exploitation by British agency, in return for a monopoly of similar exploitation (which may be said to he already at her disposal) in the northern half. These, however, are considerations which could only be decided by the attitude of Russia herself, were she approached on the subject by Her Majesty’s Government. We indicate them merely for the purpose of showing that w’e are far from confident that the suggestion, if put forward, will meet with a favourable reception. 59. A more serious drawback, from the point of view of British interests, is the fact that the capital of Persia would lie in the northern or Russian sphere&gt; and that Russian influence there, already predominant, could hardly fail to become supreme. The situation that has recently arisen in China would present itself with ten-fold gravity and emphasis. A desire would not merely be inti mated to connect the capital with the Russian railway system : hut a line itself would, we may imagine, at once be made to Tehran, while corresponding lines would in all probability he constructed from the Russian frontier in Georgia to Tabriz, and in Trans-Caspia to Meshed. With the three great cities of Northern Persia thus permanently linked with the Russian system, the power of pressure exercised by the Russian Government, which is already considerable, would he positively overwhelming. The Shah would tend more and more to become a Russian puppet, and Northern Persia a Russian proconsulate. We should look wilh great anxietv, in such a case, upon the fate of such institutions as the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the Indo-European Telegraph Department whose head-quarters are in Tehran. We should fear a marked diminution of influence on the part of Her Majesty’s representative at the capital; and we do not conceal our anticipations that in the long run such a partition might involve the peZanent break up of the Persian kingdom, and if it dni no ultimately lead to rival Russian and British Protectorates in the north and “Ut at any rate result in the selection of another capital, and m the rule of more than one native prince m Persia. , ,, fiO Neither will it he overlooked by Her Majesty s Government that, while any such aZange-ent with Russia might preclude that Power from, , and Southern Persia and in that way reaching obtaining control over Ce 1 h ^ one mome nt retard, but might on the the Persian Gulf, it uoi ,l . obiective tlirougb Mesopotamia by contrary accelerate^her adranee^totl;e^saiue mi^ feel , • way of Baghdad, iliis I jd require to he examined on independent at K^^n wiW m!

They might be the etuserf'futureTfnoyance to the British Government; but they could hardly, under any conditions, constitute a menace to the Indian Empire. 61 There remains the further danger, distinctly contemplated by. Sir M. Durand in discussing the question of a possible understanding with Russia, that would not abide by the terms of any such understanding. Sufficient grounds for this induction may unquestionably be found m the history of Russian advance in Central Asia during the past ha f century But an appreciation of the inclinations and idiosyncrasies of both parties to an agreement, in the light, where possible, of past experience, is an element in the drawing up of a fresh bargain which is not likely to he lost sight of by either agent, whether it be regarded as involving a discount from, or an appreciation or, the value or the new contract. Moreover such contracts, if not of perpetual duration, or even if ultimately infringed by one of the two parties, have been shown m many cases to be of immense value, in the respite that they aflord from the strain of an otherwise ceaseless rivalry, and in the opportunity presented for a neacefnl consolidation of existing interests. 62. We have now placed before Yonr Lordship the pros and cons, as they present themselves to our eyes, of the alternative policies in Persia. Should Her Majesty’s Government decide upon making any overtures to the Russian Government in the direction indicated, and should they either be rejected, or result in failure, it will still be possible to adopt the alternative recommended by Sir M&lt; Durand. Indeed, if the terms of a reasonable arrangement are proffered by one party, and are refused by the other, the natural corollary would appear to be that the originator of the proposal should reserve to himself the right to protect by whatever means may be at bis disposal the interests which he has endeavoured to conserve by friendly co-operation; and should meet what would in such a case he conscious aggression on the one side by retaliation on the other. 63. In either case, however, though still more in the case of a failure to arrive at an understanding with Russia, we conceive that it is incumbent upon Her Majesty’s Government and upon the Government of India to come to an early decision upon the subsidiary question, raised by Sir M. Durand, namely, as to the steps that require forthwith to be taken in order to safeguard British and Indian interests in the so-called British sphere in Persia from the competi tion with which we have shown them to be threatened. 64. Sir M. Durand, in his despatch, has made a calculation of the sums annually expended by Her Majesty’s Government and the Government of India respectively upon the British establishments at present maintained in Persia. He arrives at a grand total of £36,970 per annum distributed in the following proportions: Her Majesty’s Government, £12,876; Government of India, £24,094. . Inasmuch as these figures are not, in all respects, correct, and as they omit several items of charge for which Indian revenues are respon sible, we have made.an independent computation, which is here presented, for purposes of comparison in tabular form. In a further column we present the charges also borne by the Government of India and Her Majesty’s Government severally m respect of Mesopotamia and the Tigris—i.e., Turkish Arabia, an area, w ici ough not belonging to the Persian dominions, is so closely adjacent'■-v.ru ■-■ ■■ • ■ ■ [ 22 1 III.

According to these figures, which we have been at much pains to verify, it appears that upon the various establishments maintained by the British Government in Persia, the Imperial Government spends £15,46B and the Gov ernment of India £60,886 per annum. If Turkish Arabia be included in the calculation, as we think it must in fairness be, and as it was in a statement prepared for and presented to the Boyal Commission on Indian expenditure in 1896, the totals will amount to Great Britain £15,597, India £71,362. 66. It will not, we apprehend, be denied that these contributions do not at all fairly represent the respective proportions of Imperial and of Indian interest in Persia and its surroundings. The argument into which we entered in an earlier part of this despatch will have failed in its purpose if it has not given good grounds for thinking that in the determination of British interests in Persia too much stress has hitherto been laid upon the Indian, and too little upon the British, quota; and that a more even partition both of responsibility and of financial burden might with reason be adopted in the future. 67. This however is a question which we are not at the present moment called upon to. discuss with any minuteness, the more so as it is understood to he one of the subjects that have attracted the attention of the Royal Commission above alluded to, and that are likely to be dealt with in its Report. Wb observe that in the evidence so far printed and published, some attention has been paid to the case, and we reserve till the appearance of the final Report, any further remarks that we may have to offer thereon. 68. We would observe, however, in strict connection with the question now un er examination, vAz.^ the increase of Consular and other establishments in ema—-w ich is itself a branch of the wider subject—that in the reconsider- ation of the case for which the Government of India have more than once peace., i appears to us that one of tw r o principles may with advantage be Yle . w ' p ^ -jJ e3 ^ ire charges .which are placed upon the revenues of the n n- • i TP ire ° r . ersia a nd Turkish Arabia may be added together, and may hetwPPrf fhl certani proportions to be revised, if necessary, at definite intervals, adonted whpn -E. xc ^ e( l uers - Some such principle was Roreisrn Officp anrl° 1 6 Mission at Tehran was re-transferred to the' ratlo of the cbnr^^B 1 Z™ L \ id ^own by Lord John Russell that the are not awaro that ^ * nd } a ari d Great Britain should be as 12 to 5.

In February and again in August 1895 our predecessors expressed a very strong opinion that they should not be called upon to contribute towards the Karun service, as long as the subsidy for the mail service on the Tigris was met exclusively from Indian revenues They stated their opinion that “ the interests involved in the Karun service are pure y Imperial and not Indian, and, if this service ceases altogether the interests of India will not be affected thereby It was only after the re’ceint of an urgent appeal from the Foreign Office, and on the explicit understandinsr that the whole question of the distribution of the charges on account of the. Tigris and the Karun should he referred to the Koyal Commission then sittiog, that the Government of Lord Elgin, not without a vigorous dissent from the then Finance Member, Sir J. Westland, consented to continue the payment of a moiety of the Karun subsidy pending the stipulated decision. We cordially endorse the views which were expressed by our predecessors in respect of the Imperial and non-Indian character of this charge, and we shall be glad to learn what are the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the subject. 70. The mention of the Karun and Tigris services affords an incidental illustration of the commercial considerations by which the allocation of respon sibility that we are discussing might be determined. It is, of course, difficult to decide in the case of any particular market or harbour the exact shares of interest in it that may be claimed by British or by Indian trade. The former is more likely to be in the ascendant in the north, the latter in the south, of Persia. Broadly speaking, however, we do not think it will be disputed that the supervision and promotion of British commerce in foreign countries are a responsibility properly devolving upon the Imperial Government. The fact that a considerable proportion of the trade of any foreign town or port passes to or from India (and even of such trade a large part is apt to be often British in origin) is not a reason for placing the consular or other charges exclusively upon the Indian revenues, any more than a corresponding preponderance of Colonial trade in any particular quarter would- be regarded as a reason for demanding a contribution from the Colonies. We imagine the real line of distinction to be that, whereas the commercial interests of Her Majesty’s Indian subjects, outside of India, are in the main the concern of the Imperial Government, yet in cases where the political importance of a place or district exceeds the commercial, and where that political importance is Indian rather than English in character, the Government of India may Witimatelv be called upon to defray sometimes a large proportion, some times the whole of the cost. In this way we may account for the exclusive Uncial responsibility of India for Meshed, for Bushire and the other ports nf the Gulf P and for Baghdad (although we regard the latter as an extreme and^que^ionaWe extension of the Wciple). On the other hand the charges for Whan Kermanshah, Tabriz, &amp;c„ fall, or ought m pur judgment to fall, ispanan, jv revenues.

Our argument as to t“e magnitude and significance of those interests and the reality of the dangers with which they are availed would have been insincere, were we unprepared to give to it a practical demonstration. 72 Lor the sake of clearness we will divide the country into different spheres’, representing with sufficient accuracy the rough lines of demarcation between British and Indian interest. In the northern and central sphere, and in the western sphere, the responsibility of Her Majesty’s Government is m our iudo-ment more directly involved. In the eastern sphere, and m the southern or maritime sphere, we admit a corresponding preponderance of Indian interest. 73. Commencing with the first named of these areas, we find that Sir M. Durand recommends an improvement in the pay and status of Her Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz. In so far as our judgment on the matter is desired, it is in entire accord with the proposal. We are more doubtful about the suggestion to appoint an additional Vice-Consul at Tabriz, with the intention of posting him later on at Urumia; since we incline to the opinion that the ultimate destiny of the Persian Nestorians has been irretrievably fixed by their recent wholesale conversion to the Russian faith. We concur with Sir M. Durand as to the desirability of reducing the Consulate at Resht to a Vice- Consulate. We have before expressed our hearty concurrence with his pro posals concerning the Consulate at Ispahan. These proposals without excep tion concern in their financial aspect the British, and not the Indian, Exchequer. 74. In the western sphere Sir M. Durand advocates the appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Kermanshah, subordinate to the Consul-General at Tehran, and paid for by England, in place of the present native agent, whose modest allowance of £24 is drawn, for some unaccountable reason, from the charges for the Meshed Agency, i.e., from Indian funds. The figures of British trade passing through Kermanshah from Baghdad to Tehran appear to us amply to justify the proposed change. We are less confident about a suggestion made by Sir M. Durand, originally in connection with this route, but also with a wider application, namely, that we should depute an Indian officer to examine the various possible routes for railways in Persia and to make suggestions. Such a proceeding would, in our opinion, be both prema ture and uncalled for. -We are very doubtful whether in her present state of evolution Persia is prepared for railways.

The political and strategical impedance of SelstL Appeal to t o justify and even to necessitate the former attitude. We are encouraged to adopt the latter by the figures of trans-Nushki traffic, which have risen from “ total of li lakh m 1896 to Us. 5,90,000 in 1897 and fin &lt;mitP nf nToa season) to Its. 7,28,000 in ] 898, in which year the imports alone into Quetta from Seistan reached the value of Its. 2,50,880. ^ ta 77. e have some time past been examining the question of the permanent appointment of a British officer to Seistan; and the deputation of Captain Sykes from Kerman to Seistan in the present year, and the sanction of an annual expenditure of £400 from Indian revenues upon a Seistan Consulate kave already been mentioned. The reports of Captain Sykes are strongly adverse to the permanent appointment of a British officer to Seistan • and whilst we do not entirely concur with his reasoning, and regard his views as to some extent coloured by other prepossessions, we nevertheless are of opinion that such an appointment might for the present be postponed; the more so as it appears likely that the nomination of a Russian Consul to Seistan, though previously announced, is likely not to be persevered in, unless a British repre sentative appears permanently upon the scene. Should a Russian officer he finally appointed, we think that there will be no alternative hut to send a British officer also. In the meantime we are prepared to depute a reliable native agent from our Indian service to reside at Nasirabad, the capital of Seistan, and to appoint a second to reside at Birjand, the capital of Kain, both of these officials to he under the orders of the British Resident at Meshed, in correspondence with the Persian arrangements under which Seistan and Kain constitute a portion of the Governorship-General of Khorassan. We estimate that the annual cost of these two posts will amount to £150—£200 per annum more than the already sanctioned charge for the Seistau post; and this addition we are prepared to meet. In making these proposals we have the satisfaction of knowing that we are sure of the support both of Your Lordship and of the Poreign Office; since, in a Revenue despatch, dated December 2nd, 1897, Your Lordship, in sending to us a letter from the Foreign Office, expressing their good hopes of the future of the Quetta-Meshed route, provided that Consular protection and other facilities were furnished at points along the road, com mended these remarks to the Government of India, and added: “I trust thatthe suo-o-estion of appointing Consular Agents at points along the trade route between Quetta anIWed may receive th^ Yonr 'Excellency’s Government. It appears to me a measure ciesiraoieirom many po^ ti of View, and especially in connection with the facilities which might be afforded by t^t route for the transport of arms and ammunition between the Persian Gulf and Baluchistan. 78 As regards the trade route in question, we propose to take active measures for its development within our own territory. We contemplate spending addi tional, though not extravagant, sums upon the better provision of wells, accom modation, supplies of fodder and other stores, and the protection of the track We may even require to appoint a second British officer, to relieve Lieutenant Webb Ware of the excessive strain now imposed upon him by the administration of an extensive district, in addition to the protection of a road over 400 miles m length. We hope by these measures, wffiichwill be unostentatiously pursued, to escape the jealousy aroused bv a too open challenge of rival ambitions in Seistan, and to build up in that neighbourhood a substantial commercial and political interest, which will find no mean ally in what we believe to be the natural predisposition of the inhabitants. Experience alone can inform us whether the anticipations that have been framed by the prospects of the Nushki-Seistan trade route are over-sanguine, as in some quarters they are freely said to be. If unsuccessful, the experiment which we now propose, to make can be abandoned without discredit. If, as we believe, it will be found to have both a political and a commercial value, we shall be better enabled in the future to pronounce upon the larger schemes which have sometimes been put forward in connection with Seistan, and a reference to which will be lound in the Minute written by the Viceroy. At present, it dues not seem to us to be necessary to take them into consideration. 79. We agree with Sir M. Durand in thinking that a British Consul should be permanently appointed to Kerman. We have already sanctioned a contribution of Bs. 6,000 or £400 a year to the cost of this post; and we are prepared to continue the payment of this sum. We believe that there are good reasons for which Her Majesty’s Government may desire to continue the pay ment of a similar moiety of the cost. But should their acceptance of the increments proposed elsewhere, notably in the case of the Karun, be facilitated by our assumption of the entire cost of the Kerman Consulate, we should be prepared favourably to consider such a proposal; or, if it were preferred, to divide with them the cost of the Karun and Kerman Consulates combined. The financial result would in either case be approximately the same. 80. Sir M. Durand has suggested a British Vice-Consul, or a native agent at Bampur. Eor the present we think that the latter will be the prefer able alternative; and w r e are prepared to undertake the outlay, which will not exceed about £300 per annum. The officer in question w r ould be under the orders of the British Consul at Kerman. 8I* Einally we come to the southern sphere, including the coasts and ports oi the Persian Gulf. Your Lordship will have been prepared by what has previously been said for the announcement of our willingness to submit to some sacrifices tor the defence of an interest, so substantially grounded, and so conspicuously assailed. _ We are unable to agree with Sir M. Durand in the sug gestion that any material reduction of expenditure can be effected at Bushire. n re con rai v we are disposed to think that, if the best men in our service afWHm attr w ed t0 that even re( l uire to add to its pecuniary Bulffire fhnnlrT-r 0 ^ however ’ in thinking that the Resident at Busline should reside at Shiraz, and exercise his consular functions there during site foFaXwn -m taild i fr . 0rnC0l()nel Meade that cost of a would be fiom £1 00n1 ab i e i ^ lldm g avaiiabie either for hire or purchase) We thkffi^that F and finishing about £1,500. and Indian Government? ^ bornem ec l ual Proportions by the Imperial Governments ; and we are prepared to undertake the annual outlay[ 27 ] that may he required for up-heep and renairs nmrl fm* • • hv'S^BusU^: P1 ' eseut natiTe a§ent - duri “s’ the time that UieResident is 82 We are heartily in accord with Sir M. Durand in thinhine that a -Rrit;^ officer shou d be appointed to Bunder Abbas, with charge of the Gulfnort cast of Bushire, and of British interests in the maritime provinces of South eastern Persia. The necessity of such an appointment was mooted, as long a 'o as lh79 ’ a hat time British Hesident at Bnshire. It was raised again m 1882 1884,1885,1888 and 1892, and on the majority of these occasffins was supported by petitions from the not insignificant Himlu and Khoja popula- tion engaged m trade at Bunder Abbas. In 1893, the appointment af v^e- Consul of an Englishman engaged in business at that port was agreed to by the (lOvernmem of India and was sanctioned by the Secretary of State (Lord Kimber ey), but was subsequently dropped upon the inexplicable grounds that the estimated cost of Rs 50 a month or £10 a year could not be saved out of the Bushire Residency funds In 1-96, the question was again discussed between the Government of India and the Resident (Colonel Wilson) • and the former so far departed from their former attitude as to say that the* proposal must be held over until the normal conditions of trade had been restored by the withdrawal of the Russian sanitary cordon. These conditions have since been fulfilled, and we are prepared to look with a more favourable eye upon a proposal, the intrinsic recommendations of which are not open to dispute. W e are willing to accept the financial responsibility for the proposed appoint ment, although we think that it may he possible to meet it without additional cost by the transfer to Bunder Abbas of the Political Assistant now stationed at Meshed. Sir M. Durand suggests that the officer appointed to this post should pass the summer months at Yezd (Bunder Abbas being an impossible site of residence during the hot season), taking the place there of the present unpaid Commercial Yiee-Consnl. Upon this point w r e would propose to consult Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, which is in close connection with Bunder Abbas and the coast; and we will submit to Your Lordship at a later date our final views upon this subject. 83. Sir M. Durand mentions, as a matter affecting exclusively the Govern ment of India, the possible appointment of a British officer at Bahrein. We do not hesitate to state to Your Lordship that such an appointment is in our opinion both desirable and obligatory. Trouble, similar to that which we have 1 o t/ / already incurred in Maskat, is brewing in Bahrein, the treaty engagements of which petty State with Her Majesty’s Government provide no legitimate excuse for such complications. It is necessary to anticipate them by placing a British officer permanently in the island; and we are at the present time awaiting Colonel Meade’s definite proposals on the matter. We are inclined to think that it will probably be sufficient to nominate an officer of a sub ordinate class. Brom time to time he will also visit Koweit. It remains to be decided whether he should also have under his political jurisdiction the Trucial Chiefs of the Arab or Pirate coast, or whether these should be placed under the officer at Bunder Abbas. We incline to the former opinion, hut reserve this matter for subsequent decision. 84. We have now dealt with each one of Sir M. Durand’s specific pro posals, and have stated our own views in support, in amendment, or in supplement of them. It remains for ns to mention some additional proposals of our own, and to comment upon certain independent suggestions submitted by Her Majesty’s Minister. We entertain, and have already in the present year acted upon, the opinion that Her Majesty’s naval forces should be more strongly and frequently represented than they have hitherto been m the Persian Gulf, and that there should he recurrent visits from the Admiral of the East Indian station. During the past spring Admiral Douglas, at the request of the Viceroy, paid such a visit, and Ins presence was of material assistance dnrino- the recent crisis at Maskat. We are doubtful of the wisdom of the existing system, under which the political charge of the Makran coast, and the[ 28 ] distribution of the Telegraph subsidies, is vested in the Director-General of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Karachi, to whom a special salary of £ 120 is paid by the Government of India for the purpose. It has been proposed to us that this charge should be transferred to the Political Agent at Maskat; and for the present we reserve our opinion as to the advantages of such a'change. It would be eminently desirable that Maskat should be connected by cable with Task, since at present there is no telegraphic communi cation with any part of Oman. Put this too is a question that must wait for a later solution. 85. Sir M. Durand has proposed that all British Consular officers in Persia should have a small guard of Indian troopers similar to those now maintained at Meshed. We are not clear that such a proposal is at present desirable, and are apprehensive that it might lead to movements on the part of Itussia, for which not even the necessities of a plague cordon could be pleaded in justifi cation, and which would scarcely be distinguishable from armed occupation. In this respect we re-echo the opinion which the Government of India expressed to Your Lordship as recently as August 10th, 1898, to the effect that Indian interests are sufficiently involved to justify us in furnishing protective detach ments, as we are now doing at Task and Charbar, for Telegraph stations on the coast; but that our military provision must, for the present, be limited to this service. 86. Her Majesty’s Minister also recommends the grant of a supply of travelling tents to every British officer in Persia. As the majority of these, under the proposed arrangements, will be upon the Indian list, the suggested outlay would require in such cases to be met from Indian funds. We do not think that any general rule is required. We are in the habit of including camp equipment in the outfit of any officer whose duties require him to travel. 'We may observe, however, that tents are more likely to be required in out-of- the-way parts of the country than they are along the main roads, where the existing chapar or postal service, although destitute of almost every superficial merit, is nevertheless more rapid and therefore as a rule more convenient than travelling by caravan. 87. Lastly, Sir M. Durand makes certain recommendations with regard to the improvement and better organisation of the Telegraph service in Persia both native and European. We concur with his suggestion that no oppor tunity should be lost of getting the Persian wires, which are abominably mismanaged, transferred to our control. He then revives a suggestion, of which much has been heard during the last 20 years, that we should “ organise for political purposes” the existing establishment of the Indo-European Telegraph Department; although we do not gather very clearly from his despatch what are the precise measures recommended for that purpose. The last occasion on which a somewhat similar proposal appears to have been made was in 1887 vffien a Memorandum, dated April 27th of that year, was drawn up by Sir Muidoch Smith vvho was despatched on a semi-political Mission to Persia, and ommf , ^ 0mmeriC e u that Ct l pa1)le m p llltar y officers should be scattered about the country nominally m charge of the Telegraph stations, but in reality as political agents In a despatch, dated June 24th, 1887, the Government of India expressed a general, but guarded, approval of the scheme.

We recognise that there are advantages to British interests generally m maintaining at Baghdad an establishment on the scale and of the importance that are associated with an Indian Residency the second class. But the objects for which such an establishment is there hept up are neither exclusively, nor, as we think, mainly Indian in character. The same remark applies to the Basrah Consulate, where Her Majesty’s Govern- ment have recently taken into their hands the appointment of the Consul while leaving the entire charge to be defrayed from Indian funds. Least of all can such a claim be made for the Tigris subsidy, which, in our opinion, lalls into the category of commercial arrangements properly devolving upon Her Majesty’s Government; although under existing conditions the total cost is borne by Indian revenues. We trust that, in any reconsideration of the case, a more generous division of financial responsibility may commend itself to Her Majesty’s Government. 89. We have now completed our survey of the proposals that have been submitted to us for examination, and of the situation in Persia as it presents itself to our eyes. In commending our views to the earnest consideration of Your Lordship and of Her Majesty’s Government, we trust that we may have succeeded in impressing upon both, the gravity of the situation with which Great Britain and India are jointly faced, and the necessity, while there is yet time, of meeting it with definite and united counsels. We conclude by reiterat ing the confident hope, already expressed in our despatch of August loth, 1898, that in the last resort, and in any sudden emergency, we may rely upon Her Majesty’s Government for the protection of interests which are vital both to India and to the British Empire.

It is an indisputable proposition that neither th e Indian army, a« at present constituted, nor the Indian Exchequer, is equal to the stia : n of assuming; a British Protectorate over the whole of the centre and south of Persia. Nor is it worth while to discuss such a contin- gencj since no British Ministry is at all likely to autho rise it—at least for many a year to come. C[ubzon]. The line selected for the ultimate boundary between Russia and England in those parts appears to be by common consent the Khanikin- Seistau one. It is stated in the draft despatch, however, that under existing conditions we have neither the money nor the men to undertake such a responsibility. May I venture to question this dictum ? Should we adopt in the future such a programme as the absorption of the southern and central portions of Persia up to the Khanikin-Seistan line, it appears to me that the whole position of affairs would be altered. Concurrently with an unquestionably great increase in responsibilities in Persia, we would obtain very important relief in the pressure on our Indian frontier. The strategical position would be entirely changed. Resting on England in the west, India in the east, and the Persian Gulf to the south, we would so threaten Russia’s advance on India that it seems to me the latter country would, for the time at any rate, be practically safe. Instead of Russia constantly worrying us, she would, I submit, have the tables turned on her, and be in the position of dreading an advance by us which would threaten to cut her line of communications and possibly convert the Caspian from a Russian to an English lake. That we ourselves would incur heavy responsibilities I do not question, but I argue they would in the main be a transfer of anxieties from India to Persia. As regards the money required, from what I have read of Persia (mainly in Your Excellency’s book thereon', I gather that Persia well administered is quite capable of paying ■for her defence, and though from the same source 1 have formed but a poor opinion of the Persian proper as material for soldiers, still I understand that the tribes of the mountainous districts properly organised and well led would not form bad troops with a stiffening of our Imperial forces to support them. Turning now to what is perhaps my more correct province, the consideration of the possible occupation of this line of country by a system of railways, I would like first to notea snwestion which has occurred to me, that the highhanded action of Russia in prohibiting railway 8 construction in Persia for another Very likely true. conveniently do in the completion of her Siberian- C[rszoK]. Manchurian system which is to give her the command of all Northern China. Five years hence her main lines on that side will be completed, and she will be able to turn her energies in another direction. If I am correct m this surmise, are So far as railway construction is involved, we are not in a position to prevent the situation which Colonel Gardiner deprecates. Persia is still an independent country, and is at liberty to sign away her freedom in respect of raUways, if she is weak enough to do so. C[urzon], we wise to give Russia the time and opportunity she wishes? Should we not on our part be at any rate doing what we can to take advant age of the time at our disposal ? Russia does not wait for England when she sees an opportunity, through England being engaged elsewhere or on other grounds, for a move in advance, and I personally do not believe that any action or inaction on our part will seriously delay Russia one day beyond when she is prepared to move. On these grounds I do not myself attach any serious weight to the argument against action on our part of not giving Russia an excuse. Russia, with or without an excuse, will make her advance on the Persian Gulf as soon as she feels herself in a position to do so. In my view she is probably at present fully occupied so far as railway construction is concerned, and it pays her to bide her time. Imperial ideas also have just now rather the upper hand in England. I do not advocate any direct attempt to build railways in Persia itself at present. It seems to me that our approaches from the West and East may, and should, come first, but I think by selecting young officers with the necessary qualifications as Vice-Consuls, &amp;c., and allowing them to march about and thoroughly investigate the subject in a quiet sort of way under colour of opening out trade routes, &amp;c., we could obtain valuable reconnaissances of the various routes, and in a few years have ample details at our disposal from which to lay down our projects when the time comes for their execu tion. Where it was practicable also to start road-making, we might ensure that the roads would fit in with our railway schemes hereafter, and any extensions of telegraphs might also be adapted to the railway policy of the future. All this might be done in connection with the consolidation of our position in the southern and central portions of Persia which we look to as some day to come under our control without taking any more open or definite steps than we are apparently prepared to do at present. Your Excellency, in the draft despatch, writes that we are already in a position to judge of the railways very few in number that uuder existing conditions it would be prudent, if it were possible, to construct in Persia. I understand Your Excellency recognises as the line of the Possibly, but a remote future. &gt; future the Khanikin-Seistan route, and that this C[rszoN]. might be connected with the Persian Gulf (1) at Busmre and (2) at Bunder Abbas, or some point further to the eastward. (I write from recollection of the views expressed in Your Excellency^ book which unfortunately 1 have not got by me to refer to.) With such a definite scheme in their minds, our officers could quietly obtain all the details necessary for the prepara tion of a reliable project, the detailed execution of which would afterwards be a simple matter parti- This has been done for years. There is scarcely a caravan tract or route in Per.-ia with which we are not quite familiar. 1 must myself have read the recon naissances of at least 20 young officers specially deputed to Persia for the purpose. C[urzon]. The Bakhtiari road is now being made. Concessions for the Tehran-hum and Dizful-Khoiremabad roads have for years been in the possession of British indivi duals or institutions. But roads do uot pay in a country where traffic is solely by camels and mules. Persia is not yet ready for wheeled traffic. C[urzon]. With the exception of a few lines (and I am doubtful about that), no British Company will dream of con structing railways in Penda without either a British or an Indian guarantee. But neither Government is at all likely to give it.

While I am in accord with the despatch in so far as it goes, I venture to submit these remarks for Your Excellency's consideration. R. G[ardiner], —6-9-99. Politically and financially it would be wise to accept some expenditure in order to build up our influence in Eastern and Southern Persia and in the Persian Gulf. Such expenditure will be in the nature of a premium for insurance against disturbance: for the day that Russia attains a strong position in South-East Persia, or, through the co-operation of some foreign Power, in the Gulf, the military and financial strain already imposed upon us would be enormously increased. That Russia aims at acquiring such a position is to my mind beyond question. With Afghanistan converted into a place d’armes, she will follow the line of least resistance; turn the c6rner of that hornet's nest; and reach down to the Gulf where she may certainly expect diplo matic, if not material, support. It is just possible that Russian pressure southward might le averted if a diplomatic agree ment were arrived at dividing Persia into British and Russian spheres of influence Per aps I may hazard the opinion that a satisfactory agreement of this character is improbable. It seems m y ^ x T ^ c r e to me that Russia would have more to lose This also is my opinion, but it is not Lord Salisbury s. C[UBZ0N |. than to gain by it. Even if such an agreement were possible, we should still not he relieved from the necessity of incurring expenditure to establish our position in the British sphere On the contrary, the rate 'of 1 expenditure would probably be greater, for, if no agreemen is signed I thmk tt ts dear that our efforts, though constant and well considered, would have to be unostentarious and tentative, so as not to precipitate an active rivalry. „ ^ , , What precise expenditure in the contingency either of a paction o ^ersia m ° S .P of a continuance of the status quo, Indian S expenditure fs justifiable and inevitable. tS &amp; ■ Sl-S exception ot the re-armament of our native troops is probably more urgent. But it must be recollected that us“te ole fintTJreL^ “i“ e t“;tksVtL^ expenditure are enormous; and that, n’tthoudi we expect to place our currency on a sound basis, and thereby to quicken the develop ment of India's resources, the effect of this reform will not show itself in our revenue for some time to come. However looking to the masterly analysis of Imperial and Indian interests in Persia in this draft, to the striking disproportion between the Imperial and Indian contributions in Persia and Turkish Arabia now revealed, and to the fact that our demand for a revision of this expendi ture is likely to be powerfully supported by Lord Welby's Commission, it is not improbable that the policy now advocated will result in some immediate saving to India. In connection with the question of revision, it is important to determine what principle shall govern the division of financial responsibility between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. Two alternative principles are proposed— (1) The whole cost of diplomatic, consular, naval, telegraphic and other charges in Persia and Turkish Arabia might be divided in some fixed proportion. (2) The Imperial and Indian Governments might, respectively, accept responsibility for those areas in which Imperial or Indian interests predominate, with a joint contri bution towards the central (Tehran) establishment. There are arguments on either side; but I incline to the latter arrangement, if it can be carried out. My reasons are that, if India were responsible for the Indian area—which would, I take include Seistan- I quite agree with Mr. Dawkins’s preference, and aho with iiis reasons for arriving at it. 1 would add another, viz, that the second arrangement is far more likely to be accepted by the Home Government than the first. I am willing to add a paragraph as suggested. On the other hand, it must be remembered thut under the second plan India will certainly have to pay more (and pro bably in an increasing ratio) than under the first. (Quezon]. emergency, we anticipated London, we should it, include beistan—any action to be taken could be taken more quickly and more quietly. That is chiefly a political reason, though there is much to be said for having our contribution entirely within our control. And, financially, references to London for increasing any part of a total contribution divided in fixed proportions would be troublesome. Moreover, if, in an very likely find it difficult to get the Home Government to accept any responsibility for the amount expended in anticipation. draft.

HAMILTON, Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. :1: My Lord, Simla, the th September 1899. We desire to address Your Lordship and, through Your Lordship, Her Majesty’s Government on the subject of the relations of Great Britain with Persia. We might find an adequate reason for so doing in the fact that Your Lordship in your despatch of June 30th, 1899, enclosing a copy of a recent despatch to the Eoreign Office from Sir M. Durand, Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, concerning the maintenance of our influence in Persia, has directly invited an expression of the views of the Government of India upon this matter; and, while calling our attention to the desirability of improv ing the Political and Consular Service in that country, has at the same time stated your desire to he made acquainted with our opinions upon the remaining questions discussed by Sir M. Durand. But, in any case, we should have felt it our duty at an early date to address Your Lordship on the subject. Although the relations of Great Britain with Persia have for a period of exactly a century occupied a large, and perhaps at times a disproportionate, space upon the field of international diplomacy ; although during that time Great Britain has twice broken off diplomatic relations and has once been at war with Persia in vindication of British interests in or upon the borders of that country; and, although large sums of money have been throughout the present century and are still annually expended in the maintenance of those interests, both by Her Majesty’s Government and by the Government of India, we have not been able to discover in our records any clear definition of the principles upon which our policy towards the Persian kingdom is based, of the objects which it should keep in view, or of the scope and limits of the respective shares of responsibility, political and financial, which should be assumed by the two partners, viz.. Her Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, who are jointly concerned in the defence of Anglo-Indian interests in the dominions of the Shah. 2. We feel that there is at the present time the greater need for such a discussion because of the facts, which must be patent to all, that the Persian Government appears well nigh to have exhausted all power of recuperation or reform • and that the country, but feebly held together by any tie either of race, r r S or oval y! is only saved from a fate to which it must otherwise have Ion™ succumbed, partly by a superficial vitality not infrequently seen in foHtical oro-anisms/especially in the East, even when m an advanced stage of d P ecay still more by tlAival ambitions of the two great between whom its territories are placed, and who aie the real aibiters ot ts |lots s !K nature of ttmg^ P th o£ certain dissolution, from the ™e^f y thr particular impulse that is° required to propel them over the brink But in the last resort, and often by accident, the impetus is com municated, and the already shattered structure tumbles into irretrievable rum. 3 We think that there are signs that such an issue, if not immediately impending in Persia, is drawing near. The rule of the present Shah is distinctly and uniformly weaker than that of his predecessor The dissolvent agencies at work in the Persian kingdom are more active and persistent. Meanwhile, the encroachments of Russian power are steadfastly pursued and are less veiled bv any pretence of concealment. Other Governments and nationalities, either impelled by the secret obligations of international sympathies, or attracted by a desire to share in the probable spoils, are appearing upon the scene, and there is every reason to believe that, as in the case of the Ottoman Empire and of China, so also here, the property of the sick man, should no steps be taken in advance to prolong his existence, and should the end comp before any testamentary dispositions have been made, is likely to be subject of bitter contention between the various parties who may demand to be included among his heirs. 4. We desire, therefore, not merely to examine, in response to Your Lordship’s invitation, the particular steps that may require to be taken for the maintenance or extension of British interests in Persia at the present juncture, but to survey a wider field, and, while there is yet time, to discuss how those interests should be definitely safeguarded in the future that seems to be imminent, and what part in the outlay or in the measures that may be necessitated for that end, should be assumed respectively by Her Majesty’s Government and by the Government of India. Sir M. Durand himself concludes his despatch by saying that “ the time has come for us to lay down a definite line of policy”. We concur in this opinion, but we interpret the obligation thus admitted in a broader sense than Her Majesty’s Minister has done ; and we think that no mere stop-gap measures, however useful they may individually be, will avail for the permanent protection of our position in Persia, unless a clear understanding be arrived at in advance as to what that position is and what it demands. 5. It may not be inappropriate to state, in the first place, what we conceive British, $.&lt;?., Anglo-Indian, interests in Persia to be. They are com mercial, political, strategical and telegraphic. The total annual value of British trade with Persia has been estimated by Sir M. Durand (and, from the calculations that we have made, we believe the estimate to be below the mark) as approximately three and-a-half millions sterling; and while a great deal of this trade, particularly in the south and east, is with British India, yet the northern and western avenues of entry are devoted in the main to commercial connections^ with the British Isles. The total volume of Anglo-Persian trade continues, in spite of the difficulties encountered and the increasing insecurity m Persia, to rise and, under a more efficient and less venal regime, would probably attain to much larger dimensions. Similarly, although the experience ot the past decade has not been encouraging to British mercantile investment in I ersia, as the experience of the Tobacco Regie, the Persian Mining Rights ompany, and other ventures, has shown, there is nevertheless a good deal of ntish capital sunk m various industrial undertakings in different parts of the country. ° 1 • • *n P 0 ^ lca \interests of Great Britain in Persia, although they date ongma y iom a period before India had become a British interest at all, were, in len leviva a century ago, in the main Indian in inception, and are still largely Indian m character. It would be unfair, however, at the present day to[ 3 ] atfribiite to them an exciusively Indian complexion. Ever since the first visit ot the late Shah to Europe Persia has been drawn increasingly into the tor ex of European politics. Neither Prance, Germany, Austria, Italy, Holland not Belgium own possessions contiguous to the Persian dominions. Their commercial stake m the country is relatively small. Notwithstanding they find it to their interest to maintain what are m some cases costly and extensiVe, diplomat establishments at Tehran, and they occupy a minor, but nevertheless a definite position upon the local diplomatic stage. It is to be surmised, therefore, that’ even lad British India not existed, or had it passed into other hands, the British Government would nevertheless before now have been compelled to take an active political interest in Persian fortunes. Persia is in fact one of those countries which,, whether or not they had fallen into the orbit of Western Powers, more ^vigorous than themselves, must inevitably have attracted the attention of Europe, partly from their increasing infirmity, hut still more from the opportunities suggested .by their latent, though neglected, sources of strength. The two-fold British interest and responsibility here indicated have indeed been recognised by the system, now of long standing, under which the charges of the diplomatic establishment maintained by Her Majesty’s Govern ment at Tehran are shared between the Imperial and the Indian exchequers. That such a division of common interest has become necessary, that the politics of Tehran, which with one eye turned towards India looks with the other towards St. Petersburgh and Constantinople, are but one aspect of the eternal Eastern question, and that the control of British diplomacy at Tehran must therefore be vested in the hands of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs, are propositions which 40 years ago were hotly contested by certain schools of thought, but that will not any longer be a matter of dispute. They serve to illustrate the Imperial, as distinct from the purely Indian, character of Anglo- Persian relations. 7. The strategical interests of Great Britain in Persia arise from conditions with which India is most intimately concerned. Long before the boundaries of British India had been extended to their present limits, or before Russia had become a great Central Asian Power, approaching or impinging at many points upon the Indian frontiers, the fortunes of Persia, though not at that time a coterminous country, had become a matter of vital concern to the British dominion in India. In the early years of the present century, when the ambi tions of Prance were the main source of apprehension, it was through Persia that a blow at British supremacy was expected to be struck, and that an inva sion of India was planned. The same idea has re-appeared at intervals since. How that the boundaries of Afghanistan, which have been demarcated and guaranteed by Great Britain, march for many hundreds of miles with those of Persia; that Persian territory is also coterminous for hundreds of miles with Baluchistan, a State under a British Protectorate, and in large measure actually administered by the officers of the Government of India ; .and that the sea which washes the southern coasts of Persia is one m which, both from its proximity to the Indian Ocean and as a result of the exertions of the past century Indian interests and influence have become supreme—it is clear that 1 ersia has assumed a strategical importance, in relation to British Indl ®’ t b be serious, were the resources or the designs ot that country itself alone to e considered; but which is indisputably great, when it is * tum ^ pressing upon Persia and upon Afghanistan is the ever-grov m momen^ i f Power whose interests in Asia are not always in accord with om own,^and that the Persian Gulf is beginning to attract the Jpere^t of h eme times rival nations. These conditions, however, while they m ^nnot concern which those who are responsible for the government obvious in fail to feel in the fortunes of Persia, are nevertheless su J t p eir their general application to render it meY e\j the destinies far more than local range, or to argue y Empire. It is from of British dominion m India, hut those of t . +lf p ia in strategical, this point of view that we hold strongly le opmi ^ Imperial, no less than in its political, aspect is not only an Indian, hut is also an irniconcern, and that we feel no hesitation in appealing to Her Majesty’s Government for a frank and generous recognition of this common responsibility. 8. The telegraphic interests of Great Britain in Persia may be said to be evenly divided between the mother-country and India. Por whilst on the one hand the wires that have been constructed between the north-west frontier and Tehran and which provide the earlier link in the Persian section of the main overland connection with the East, are in the hands of a Company whose domicile is in London, from Tehran onwards to the Gulf the undertaking is conducted by an establishment that is recruited and paid for by the Govern ment of India, while its head-quarters are in the India Office in London. This two-fold system exists in order to maintain a connection which may be said to be equally British and Indian, since it is equally indispensable to the interests of both countries; but which also has an ulterior and wider scope, inasmuch as the Trans-Persian wires, and the sub-marine cables by which they are supplemented in the Persian Gulf, are largely utilised for the conveyance of messages between Great Britain and places lying beyond India, notably the Australasian Colonies. Prom a calculation based upon the aggregate results of the past five years, we have ascertained that no less than 30 per cent of the total traffic is of this description. Nevertheless the cost, in so far as it is borne by either Government, devolves exclusively upon the Indian, and not upon the Home, Exchequer. 9. Such are the main interests of Great Britain in Persia. It will be observed that the shares that may be claimed by the mother-country and by India in the sum total of those interests, have in the passage of time become so interwoven and fused as to render the task of separating or distinguishing them neither easy nor profitable. It may not be difficult, as we shall endeavour to argue later on, to distinguish between sources of expenditure which should more properly fall to the charge of the one or the other partner. But we maintain that enough has been said to prove that on the broad field of international policy Persia is not exclusively an Indian interest, but is emphatically an Imperial interest of Great Britain ; and that the latter should be prepared to exert her full strength for the defence of that interest, should it be jeopardised or impugned. 10. In discussing the manner in which it is desirable that these principles, if accepted, should be carried into action, we are anxious at the outset to make our position, in one respect, perfectly clear. We have no desire to make an addition to the political pr territorial responsibilities of India, for which we have not, under existing conditions, the means either in money or in men. We are not about to propose that there should be established any Protectorate, open or covert, over any part of the Shah s dominions, that might compel us in the future to hold iw C Ti 7 S ° p , rote , ctcd ^ arms. We can conceive of circumstances that mioht some day tempt both the Indian and the Home Governments from ite wt°atTr e, f and that + W0 ' ld . i “ a case whCT 0 the vital interests of the are st 11 unnremred 1 uTf W” conslder a ^’den for which our shoulders to maki™ P secnre d the BU for , tlle P re * eIlt ° ur ambitions are exclusively limited to making secure the interest which we have already built up and still more to preventing it from being undermined or taken from us bvothers with the result not only of a considerable accretion of strength to them but of Positive detriment to ourselves. We have, in fine no desire tn rlf+T,’ £ X P rf i stains quo in Persia so long as it can be maintained.

There remain Russia and GrZ Britain. Theie is a curious correspondence, hut there are also notable differ ences, between the positions of these two Powers vis a vis with Pet a The enare northern frontier of Persia is now contiguous with Russian territory with the exception of that portion which borders upon the Caspian Sea-a distinction, but not a difterence, inasmuch as that sea has to all intents and purposes been converted into a Prussian lake. Russian territory also overlaps the north-east corner of the Persian dominions. Great Britain enjoys a some- vdiat similar preponderance of influence on the south, hy virtue of her hitherto unchallenged supremacy, both naval and commercial, in the Persian Gulf • while, owing to recent developments on the side of Baluchistan, her land territories also touch those of Persia upon the south-east. But there are these broad differences between the two positions: firstly, that whereas the Russian territories that are limitrophe with Persia on the north are continuous either with those of European or with those of Asiatic Russia, the immense resources of. both of which dominions can be brought by a skilfully designed system of railways, and deposited with little trouble and with no delay, upon the Persian frontier itself—the forces of Great Britain, if required for' purposes either of menace or attack, would require to be conveyed by sea and would be separated by a great distance from their base; the land connection on the Perso-Baluch side being as yet too precarious and remote to admit of its being taken into serious consideration in the present context; secondly, that whereas the Russian land approaches upon the north are in her own exclusive possession, the maritime access of Great Britain on the south is equally open to any other Power possessing a naval marine. Hence the marked and inevitable distinction between the power of persuasion or menace possessed by Russia in the north, as compared with that at the disposal of Great Britain in the south, the advantage enjoyed by the former being enhanced by the fact that the Persian capital and Court are situated in the northern or Russian and not in the southern or British zone of influence. 13. In these circumstances it is not surprising to read of the increasing and indisputable supremacy which Russia has established in Northern Persia, as described by Sir M. Durand. While not repeating his demonstration, we may supplement it by saying that, while we think that no efforts should be spared to safeguard so much as is left to us of the trade that enters the country by the Trebizond-Tabriz route, of the trade of Tehran, and of that of North- East Persia (concerning which it may be noted that the imports into Meshed from British India which in 1893-91 represented a value of £198,500 and in 1894-95 of £312,000, have in 1897-98. sunk to £130,000), and while as long as the capital remains at Tehran, which is also the centre of important British interests in the shape of the Telegraph administration and the Imperial Bank of Persia, it is essential that British influence there should be asserted on a scale as nearly as possible equivalent to that of Russia we are.yet of opinion that the advantages enjoyed hy Russia in the field under discussion aie so oier- whelming as to render any attempt to dispute or to shake her position there fruitless; and that our own energies can with greater wisdom and with superior chances of success be directed towards the protection and consolidation ol theiliMilHIIIIIIIIIIIHHI*ll |1111 Ill [ 6 ] British sphere of influence in the centre and south. It is to a more critical examination of this subject that we now turn. 14 Sir M Durand has in his despatch drawn a line across Persia from TTlui nit'in on the Turkish frontier on the west, through Kermanshah, Hamadan, Dpahan/Yezd and Kerman to Seistan and the Afghan frontier on the east, as indicating approximately the existing line of partition between the British and Russian spheres of influence both political and commercial m Persia. 15 Polio win' the same order from the west, we concur with what he has written*about the importance of fostering the Baghdad trade route wdj Kerman- sdmh t/o Tehran British commerce by which approaches m value to £1,000,000 per annum This is a route of peculiar value both to British and to Indian trade, and one upon which we should on no account forfeit the supremacy. We have no hesitation in recommending, with Sir M. Durand, the substitution of a British Vice-Consul at Kermanshah for the present native agent: although we think that the cost of the proposed appointment which lies outside of what may be called the more strictly Indian zone, and which will be subordinate to the Consulate-General at Tehran, should be borne by Imperial and not by Indian revenues. 16. Whatever be the prospects of opening up, either by road or by railway (and concerning the latter we are sceptical), the country that lies northward of the Karun River, and that is inhabited by the Lurs and other nomad tribes, it is certain that British influence has obtained a material foothold in that corner of the Shah’s dominions, through which the Karun flows in its middle and lower course, and where the road now being constructed through the Bakhtiari country, by contract between the Bakhtiari Chiefs and Messrs. Lynch, should open an alternative and almost exclusively British door of commercial access to Ispahan. We do not express any opinion as to the ideas which Sir M. Durand has more than once put forward as to the desirability of raising a local irregular force under British officers from the tribes in this part of Persia. Such a scheme would appear to postulate a firmer and more permanent footing than we have as yet established in South-West Persia. Nevertheless we think that no opportunity should be lost of strengthening our influence with the Arab, Bakhtiari and Lur tribes—an effort to challenge which from a rival quarter appears likely before long to be made—and we concur in Sir M. Durand’s recommendations as to the desirability of establishing a Consulate on the Karun, reserving for a subsequent paragraph our opinion as to the proper incidence of the cost. 17. Continuing in an easterly direction, we have noticed from the recent Consular Report of Mr. J. R. Preece, Her Majesty’s Consul at Ispahan, that “ British trade in Ispahan has shown during the last two years, if not an absolute decrease, at all events no expansion whatever ”, while great strides have been made in Russian importations, notably of glassware and hardware. We agree with Sir M. Durand in thinking that the British Consul should be raised in respect of title and pay to the same level as the recently arrived Russian representative, although, as this is a matter which mainly concerns the English Foreign Office, we are not clear that we are called upon to advise upon, the subject. M e cannot, however, too strongly emphasise our opinion _iat in any partition either of commercial or political spheres of influence in eisia, Ispahan, the old (and, if Persia should ultimately break up, possibly a u urc) capital, the seat of the Sefavi dynasty, the principal market of Central ersia, and (far more than Tehran) the focus of Persian nationality, must, on c v r ei y ground, be included in the zone in which British interests are supreme. also concur with Sir M. Durand in thinking that British interests ec l 1 ^ e J ^Pjasenfed at Shiraz by the present native agent, who x, t&gt; ^ 10 ^ influence or power; and that the experiment of bringing the Resident m the Persian Gulf, who is also Consul-General for Pars, to reside' ^ : : . itlij x il c 7 ] area of jurisdietTon, loulVbrgten^^fUherM^ctlon^^^^^ h! - ° ffioial compeUeTtohirehou^eaccomStio^at” 6 '’ m ° nthS ^ were are made recurrent, we are incHned tn tblv A ?

We will for the mo^en “ comments upon this suggestion. At Kerman, which is the capital of an important province, and the seat of a Governor-General, the appointment of a British Consul which was first sanctioned under exceptional P cLumstances m the case of Captain Sykes m 1894, has at frequent intervals since, the atest being our despatch of August 10th, 1898, been the subject of discussion between Her Majesty s Government and the Government of India. The present position is this, that for 5 years the Government of India have expressed their willingness to contribute one-half of the cost of the Kerman Consulate up to. a limit of Bs.. 6,000 per annum. The views of the Foreign Office upon this proposal, which was communicated to it by Your Lordship on September 21st, 1898, have not yet been received by us. Sir M. Durand now proposes that this Consulate should be made permanent, and that possibly a native agent under its orders should he sent to Bampur. Before discussing these pro posals, u e think it advisable to analyse the larger issues raised by the questions of Seistan and the Persian Gulf. 20. Concerning Seistan, its importance and the present position there, we refer Your Lordship to a Minute which has been written by the Viceroy, who has made a special study of the question, and which is enclosed with this despatch. The facts enumerated by him are, we think, sufficient to show that Seistan is, by reason of its geographical position in relation both to North Khorasan, to Western Afghanistan, to British Baluchistan, and to the Persian Gulf, a position of no small strategical importance. Seistan is the present meeting point of the advanced pioneers of British and Bussian influence. Perhaps on the whole, owing to recent activity on our part, the British position and chances are the more hopeful. It is essential in the future, for reasons which have been argued in the Viceroy’s Minute, that Seistan should be retained in the British zone. It is fortunately not too late to secure that consummation. The steps wdiich should be taken with that object will be examined when we formulate our final recommendations at the close of this despatch. 21. South of Seistan lies the still imperfectly known district of Persian Baluchistan. Every year this province is being brought into closer contact with British associations, partly from the visits of British officers, partly from the wide-spreading influence exercised by the Nushki-Seistan Trade route, still more from the close connections, political and racial, prevailing between the inhabitants of the two sides of the Perso-Baluch border—a condition of affairs which is likely to be confirmed by the inevitable increase of British influence in the dominions of the Khan of Kalat. ix- fVm vnrious sub-areas composing wliat we have 22.

On the southern and western coasts is the still independent kingdom or Sultanate of Oman (Maskat). 24. The de facto position upon the waters and on the shores of the Persian Gulf reflects a more positive British predominance than the preceding paragraph mMit indicate. In the early years of the present century, the slave trade was rampant in the Gulf, and the vessels of the Indian Marine uere engaged in a long and arduous struggle with the Arab pirates who infested its southern coasts. This conflict which was conducted entirely by British agency and means, without any help from the Persian Government, resulted in the establish ment of treaty relations with the great majority of the Arab Chiefs, under which they hound themselves to observe perpetual peace and to refer all disputes to the British Resident at Bushire. The pax Britannica, which has ever since, with rare exceptions, been maintained, is the issue of these arrange ments and is the exclusive work of this country. Of similar origin were the soundings of the channels and the surveys of the shores of the Persian Gulf, which the navigators of all nations owe to the labours of a long line of naval officers of the Indian service. Meanwhile, British trade has acquired almost a monopoly of the foreign commerce of the Gulf ports. Indian Bunias from Shikarpur and other parts of Sind have settled in considerable numbers at Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Bushire and Bahrein. They frequently farm the customs. The foreign imports and exports pass through their hands. These are for the most part conveyed to and from the Gulf in British ships, more than one Anglo-Indian Company (the { British India’, the c Bombay and Persia’, and the e Anglo-Arabian and Persian Gulf ’) having maintained for years a merchant steamer service between Karachi and Basrah, touching at the Gulf ports on the way, whilst the rival ventures that have occasionally been attempted by foreign nations have uniformly failed and have been withdrawn. 25. As the result of careful calculations of the trade returns of the three years, 1895-96-97, which are the latest at our disposal, we have ascertained that the total value of Imports and Exports in the Persian Gulf (including the Persian ports of Bunder Abbas, Eingah, Bushire, and Mohammerah; the Arab poris on the opposite coast; and Bahrein) in that triennial period amounted to £17,241,300 (at the rate of Rs. 15=£1). Of this total, Local trade accounted for £5,124,000, and External trade for £12,117,300; while of the latter total the trade with British possessions (including India) amounted to £9,709,500,[ 9 ] « a Zn ttcl In ,r ^ y ea rS) 2 039 were British, and their tonnage represented 84 ®i eared , fr &lt;?“ th e Gulf ports, ^/ 1 1 ? r . r , &lt;dui lls l &gt;ers i a n ports alone be reouired ?p r C f nt ^ le tota l tonnage. £11,172,000, of which local trade — 12 liw ion h f U1 S s are Tota l trade, £9,002,600, the British proportio oFthe’wt n • and eJ External trad e = cent.

Similar machinations are known to be in progress at Bahrein, and will require to be counteracted by a more strict enforcement of the conditions to which the Sheikh is by treaty bound. _ Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but included w ithm the sphere of its political influence, the Arab State of Maskat has for years been controlled by British influence; its trade is similarly in An^lo- Indian hands; and its ruler lias not merely for years been subsidised by the Government of India,, but in 1891 entered into an Agreement with us, under the orders of Her Majesty’s Government, not to alienate any portion ’ of his dominions to any other Power. 27. Such, briefly summarised, is the position that has been won by Great Britain, not without the expenditure of many millions of money and the sacrifice of many valuable lives, in the Persian Gulf. In its vindication we have more than once been called upon to enter into military occupation of ports or islands in the Gulf. The island of Kharak was occupied by Indian forces from 1838 to 1842, and again in 1856-57. Bushire was held during the latter years, as also were Mohammerah and Ahwaz upon the Karun. The occupation of these places was an illustration of the vigour with which in past years onr ascendency has been maintained. Their abandonment was a proof of the reluctance which has invariably been displayed to emphasise or to perpetuate these responsibilities. The latter, however, no less than the British position in Southern Persia in general, are now threatened by an external competition, to the evidences of which we next turn. 28. Sir M. Durand has in general terms described the commanding posi tion which the proximity of the Trans-Caspian Railway and of her Central Asian garrisons, the construction of the Ashkabad-Kuchan-Meshed cart-road, and the annual expenditure of large sums of money, have enabled Russia to take up in the politics and commerce of the province of Khorasan. We proceed to develop the argument by showing bow the Khorasan position lias been and is being utilised as the base of a further and more southerly advance. 29. ( It was in 1889 that the campaign of what may be termed the Russi fication of Khorasan was opened with the appointment of a Russian Consul- General at Meshed. In 1891 a native trader, named Haji Agha, appeared as[ 10 ] i. 0 + T^r-in-nrl • and an emissary of bad character, named Kussian News-agen ^who'had already been dismissed from the Russian Muhammad and was posted as News-agent at Nasira- had m feel s t ““ , . surveying the country m a southerly direction, as far 'asTe Srf Baluchistan. ^ 1895 a more direct blow at the laree Anglo-Indian trade which at that time still made its way through Khorasan into the Russian possessions in Central Asia was struck by the introduction of a Customs Tariff in Trans-Caspia, absolutely prohibiting the entry into the Kussian territories of all British or Indian products except indigo, tea and muslin, and these only under a heavy duty. In the same year M. Zaroudny, a Russian politico-geologist, Anglice surveyor, paid his first visit to Kain and Seistan. Russian News-agents were also placed at Tabbas anon no of Tiirin,nd and Nasirabad. 30. In the meantime, in the latter part of 1896, the Government of India had decided upon taking active measures to open the iong closed trading route from Quetta to Seistan. These intentions, and the prospective British interest in Seistan to which they testified, excited much concern in Russia; and in the following year the outbreak of plague in India offered to the Russian authorities a welcome opportunity of, at the same time, endeavouring to strangle the new enterprise at its birth, and increasing their own influence m Seistan. Under the pretext of establishing a protective cordon to safeguard the Perso-Afghan frontier in Persian interests from a disease which existed neither in Baluchistan nor in Afghanistan, Russian Cossacks under Russian officers were planted at a number of places in Persian territory, where they turned back every caravan (ignoring an agreement that had been arrived at between Great Britain and Persia for a 10 days quarantine upon caravans arriving from infected countries), declined to accept any orders except those which came directly from the Russian Legation, and for a time absolutely closed the Herat-Meshed, road, in spite of orders to the contrary from the Persian Government—the object of this measure being to divert Afghan trade from Meshed to Panjdeh and Merv in Russian territory. It was significant that upon crossing the Russian frontier the caravans, which had been refused passage through Persia under any condi tions, were only detained for three days in quarantine. The Persian Govern ment, after a feeble protest, acquiesced in these proceedings; and it may almost be said that Southern Khorasan passed for a time under Russian control. 31. It was with the object of anticipating a similar Russian intervention in Seistan that, in the spring of 3897, the Government of India despatched Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh to superintend any preventive measures that might be required in that district. Already Lieutenant Webb Ware, who had visited Seistan in March, in connection with the trade route, had reported : “ I was disagreeably astonished to find what ascendency Russia had gained through out Seistan Major Brazier-Creagh, a few months later, wrote : “ I was by no means surprised to find what ascendency the Russians had gained in the country. In the past four years Russian activity has been very manifest. It is not limited to Seistan, but extends all along the Perso-Afghan frontier up to Meshed, News-writers and agents being established at all the important trade centres, viz., Neh, Birjand, Tabbas, Khaf, and Turbat-i-Haidari 32.. The recommendations made by the British officer were ignored by the Persian authorities; and he had not been long in Seistan when the expected Russian doctor (Miladchevsky by name), with an escort of eight Cossacks, appeared. upon the scene, a detachment of ten Cossacks under a Russian officer being also posted at Turbat-i-Haidari, 80 miles south of Meshed, a pom o junction of several caravan roads, so as effectually to stop any traffic o or rom Seistan. .An incidental result of Dr. Miladchevsky’s visit to Seistan was the dismissal, m consequence of a report from him, of the two native ussmn agen s o whom reference has been made, and their replacement by ie e.sian su -contractors for customs for Kain and Seistan. These indivi- cua s pio\c to e equally faithless to the interests of their employers, and were% 'Hi imme- at appear lifi* [ 11 ] relieved of the representation of Russian intere^ in -i * y eai \ was then announced that a Russian named^ZiedW ^ appointed Russian Consul in Seistan—-nn „ mea , Zl edler, had been diately followed by the despatch of Captain Sykes^MtLto BrMsh C “T®' Kerman to Seistan in a similar capacity! The Russian Consul wSdd not yet to have taken up his post; and the Russian authoritielare 1 5,. 1 : EfotSi.' nes * “* 0^0 of Her Majesty’s Qoyerameut before deoidbg former labours W and 1 on The ^n' Zar J 3U( ^ n y re -appeared upon the scene of his \r o r ’ ?&gt; • present occasion pushed his politico-scientific studies as far south as Persian Baluchistan and B^mpur. Early in the present year the Agent to the Governor-General at Meshed reported that two Russian officers, 1 doctor and 10 Cossacks were still at 1 Turhat-i-Haidari, and 1 Russian Officer, 2 Medical Assistants and 10 Cossacks at Karez. There are also 58 Persian sowars scattered about at different places between Meshed and Seistan, who are paid through the Russian officers and take their orders from them. The recrudescence of plague in India has in fact provided an excuse for the continuance, just as its original appearance was pleaded in support of the in troduction, of a (juusi -Russian Protectorate in Southern Khorasan. A more active assertion of the same pretensions has since been witnessed in the mission of M!. Stroeff, Dragoman to the Russian Consulate at Meshed, with presents valued at El,TOO, to the Persian Governor of Rain, who is brother to the Governor of Seistan and is believed to covet the succession to that post. The sanitary plea was also advanced in the course of the past summer to explain the despatch of Russian dectors to Rerman and even to Shiraz. An interesting commentary upon these proceedings may be found in an observation in Lieutenant Webb Ware’s report upon the Quetta-Seistan trade route for 1897-98, where he says that “ the chief hindrance to the further development of this route is to be found in the obstructive measures taken by the Russian officers striving to further the interests of that country at the expense of India”. 31. The facts which we have enumerated will, we think, be sufficient to convince Your Lordship of two propositions: firstly, that Russia regards with unconcealed aversion the opening of the British commercial route from India to Seistan and Rhorasan, and will spare no efforts to rob it of success; secondly, that she regards with an interested eye the future of Seistan itself, and is already preparing, by a display of armed force and by the assumption of executive authority, to pave the way for an eventual inclusion within the Russian sphere of that portion of the Shah’s dominions. 35. In tbe same context, and as illustrating the political and strategical object which such an advance may be believed to have in view, it will not be forgotten that during the past few years, the Russian Government have constructed a railway from Merv to Rushk upon the Afghan frontier within 80 miles of Herat, and have stacked at the terminus the railway plant for a future extension to Herat itself. Should any doubt be entertained as to the purpose for which this extension (which is destitute of any commercial justifi cation) was planned, it may be solved by a reference to the frank admission made to Sir N. O’Conor by M. deWitte, Russian Minister of Einance, in June 1898, that it was designed “ to enable Russia to attack Afghanistan in case of complications with England ”. Wlien it is remembered that such an attack can only be made in direct violation of solemn international engagements, it is not, we think, incumbent upon us to argue at further length that the political ambitions of Russia in Eastern Persia, and in close proximity to the Afghan bolder, have an ulterior significance which it would be folly to ignore. 36. Nor can we divorce these proceedings from the idea that, in seeking to obtain a preferential footing in Seistan, Russia is not merely endeavouring to block a promising avenue of Anglo-Indian trade, and to acquire a position of potential menace to British interests on the western flank of Afghanistan but that she is also concerned in the prosecution of an advance, which is n expected to terminate until it has brought her to the Persian Gulf. It is known[ 12 ] that at least on one occasion negotiations for the cession to Russia of a Persian port at the eastern extremity of the Gulf have taken place between the Russian and the Persian Governments ; and, if such negotiations have hitherto either proved abortive, or have been nominally xepudiated by one or other of the parties concerned, it is yet, we think, in oui powei to show that they are not only not inconsistent with, but are definitely coiroboiatcd by, the evidences of Russian activity in Central and Southern Persia to which we now turn. 37. In 1897, a Russian Consul was appointed for the first time to Ispahan, where Russian imports had not hitherto greatly exceeded a total of 300 bales per annum. He was given a salary and title in excess of those enjoyed by the British representative. During the present year this official, Prince Dabiya, has been heard of at Shiraz and Bushire as the guest of the Prench Vice- Consul, and subsequently at Mohammerah and Shushter on the Karun, where he freely denounced British methods and ambitions. Sir M. Durand has recently informed us by telegraph that the corps of so-called Persian Cossacks at Tehran (i.c., Persian soldiers trained and commanded by Russian officers) has been raised from 1,000 to 1,500 men, and that detachments of this corps have for the first time been taken with them to the south by the Governors of Shiraz and Arabistam Por the present the Russian officers have stayed behind; but it is not difficult to imagine the circumstances in which they might claim to rejoin their regiments. In 1897, M. Krugelow was sent from Jerusalem as Russian Consul to Baghdad, with the special object of reporting upon the acquisition by Russia of a coaling station in the Persian Gulf. This gentleman has taken much interest in Koweit, where Russian emissaries from Baghdad have been residing continuously during the present year. In this context it will not be forgotten that the concession recently sought for with the aid of the Russian Embassy at Constantinople by Count Kapnist, a Russian of high rank, for a railway from Tripoli in Syria to the Persian Gulf contemplated 3 a terminus at Koweit. 38. . In Bushire and Bunder Abbas the Russians have lately developed a marked interest. Two Russian doctors (Drs. Marc and Oust) arrived at Bushire in 1897 for the now familiar purpose of studying the plague, which, however, did not make its appearance until two years later,'in 1899. Dr. Marc in 1897 occupied his waiting hours in visiting Bunder Abbas, from whence he was in the habit of despatching official reports to his Government, and where he magnanimously treated all patients free of charge. His medical pursuits at this place were assisted by a third Russian, named Adamoff, who appears to have been an artillery officer, and who subsequently visited Bushire and Basrah. In 1898 two other Russian doctors, named Rodzewitz and Kornaievski, appeared upon the scene, and visited Basrah, Bushire and Bunder Abbas. In ecem ei a ' ti Russian doctor, named Paschkowski, arrived in the no ^ ai to P a y fhe regulation visit to Bunder Abbas; while he nWiW b G l Jr 1 ofesslonal activity during the recent outbreak of to EmsD &gt; ; W16re he , has announced that, upon his approaching return IdlaTmona^andn it ^ two T com P^iots.

There are more over other means, well-known to Her Majesty’s Government from recent experience in other parts of the world, of obtaining political and territorial influence, independently of the actual acquisition of harbours or stations. 40. It is, in onr opinion, more than a coincidence that simultaneously with the increasing Kussian interest in Central and Southern Persia which we have described, there should also have been a notable revival cf French activity in those quarters. In 1896 the Messageries Maritimes Company commenced a subsidised service from Bombay to the ports of the Persian Gulf; although, owing to vessels of unsuitable draught having been employed, the enterprise was not n success and was shortly abandoned. In 1897 a French Vice-Consul (M. Ferrand) was for the first time appointed at Bushire, although the value of French trade with the Persian Gulf in that year amounted only to the modest total of £82,618 (of which £73,899 was sugar). He was succeeded in 1898 by M. Bryois, who recently informed the agent of one of the British Trading Companies at Bushh e that the French Government intended shortly to establish a subsidised line of steamers to Mohammerah and the Karan. It was perhaps in connection with this project that in March 1899, M. Bryois paid a visit to the Karun, where a French scientific party, under M. de Morgan, has for some time been engaged in politico-archaeological researches in Arabistan. When the French Charge d’Affaires, Comte d’Arlot, recently visited Ispahan, the Zil-es-Sultan vouch safed the corroborative information to the B ritish Legation that the object of these movements on the part of the French was to obtain a footing at Mohammerah, Shnshter and Dizful. During our recent negotiations with the Sheikh of Koweit about the future of that harbour, it was with some surprise that we learned from him that the French had already approached him on the subject. In Bahrein a so-called French merchant, M. Goguyer, who until recently was engaged in Maskat in an attempt to revive the traffic in arms under the French flag, has been reported as endeavouring to induce the inhabitants to purchase French piotcc- tion by the payment of small sums. In 1899 a French Consular Agency was established at Lingah, where the same ingenious system of manufacturing French subjects (for the most successful illustration of which we must look to Siam) was started, and where the French flag was hoisted by the Dragoman of the French Vice-Consul at Bushire. Finally, Her Majesty’s Government are better aware than ourselves of the recent negotiations for a French loan to the Persian Government upon the security of the customs of the Gull ports, and a promise of a railway monopoly in that country.imunyunuimil iiiihiihiuiiiii Ill I — [ W ] 41 French interests in the Persian Gnlf, either poht.cal or commercial are so small; her own territories are so distant; and the Gulf lies so far out of theTrack of her merchant vessels or men-o -war, that we are unable to construe these proceedings in any other light than as an attempt to^ cause trouble and annoyance to a possible rival, and to lend an independent assistance to tlie plans of^ a European ally. will, in our opinion, be^ ’ ^ x ^ nnrl n French man-of- Substantial confirmation of these views hp derived from a study of recent French action at Maskat, where, although French trade is infinitesimal, and war has been in the habit of paying a passing visit on an average only once in the vear the French Government have nevertheless during the past six months been endeavouring to obtain, under the guise of coaling facilities, a position which would provide them with an independent pied a terre m the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf. This policy has been foreshadowed by the free grant of the French flag to Arab dhows, owning allegiance to the Sultan of Maskat, and is facilitated by the influence over the latter petty potentate that has been acquired by the French Vice-Consul, whose anti-British inclina tions and intrigues are so well known to Her Majesty s Government as to require no recapitulation here. Confirmation of our suspicions regarding a Franco-Russian entente in Persia and in the Persian Gulf is further afforded by a telegram, dated June 7th, 1899, from Sir M. Durand to Colonel Meade, which has already been communicated both to Your Lordship and to the Foreign Office, and in which Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran remarks : “ You may be quite certain that Russia and France are working in unison 42. It should be noted that in the recent papers, with copies of which we have been favoured by Her Majesty’s Government, we have found a repudiation of French ambitions in the quarter under discussion, no less explicit than that which we have already quoted from the lips of Count Mouravieff. On July 19th, 1899, M. Camhon said to Lord Salisbury that “ France had no political aspiration whatever in the Persian Gnlf; that she did not desire any kind of fortification or settlement or political privileges, or anything beyond the maintenance of those rights already insured to her by treaty We have been gratified to read this assurance, by which we hope that succeeding French ministries may hold themselves hound. But we regret that it has not been communicated, not merely to Her Majesty’s Government, hut also to the French Agents in those regions, who do not appear to be equally acquainted with the views of the Government that they serve. 43. In recent years Germany lias begun to display a positive and an increasing interest in Persia and also in the Persian Gulf. This interest has been the historical, and perhaps the natural, sequel of a commercial policy that has for some time aimed at securing the control of the principal railways in the Turkish dominions in Asia Minor, and of a political ambition, that more recently still, would appear to aim at the protection of the Ottoman Empire, alike in Europe and Asia. The obvious corollary to a system of German railways in Asia Minor, would he similar railroads to the Persian border and through Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf. Already, as Sir M. Durand has in formed the Foreign Office, the Germans have procured a concession for the construction of a road from Khanikin, on the Turko-Persian frontier, to Tehran, and have apparently only abstained from pressing for a railroad in the same quarter, because of the violent opposition with which the Russian M inister met the proposal at Tehran. The second son of the Shah, Prince Malik Mansur, lias been spending several months in 1898-99 in Germany, where his education and proclivities are reported as having acquired a marked philo-Teutonic tinge. jerman military instructors have been proffered for the reorganisation of the , 1 ors J an ‘? rm ^ Prolongations of the Turko-German railways to Baghdad and to ic ersian Gulf have been and are still being freely discussed; and the German Government are endeavouring to procure an interest in the overland Turkish i &lt; ?.^ a0, ^ fhe Gulf itself a German Consulate was established in . % us nre ’ to safeguard the interests of six German subjects in the entire ports o± that sea.

German interests, however, have a tendency to erow Wit i some rapidity, and by steps which are not always acceptable to thpir* neighbours : and we think that the need for an early decision upon the future pa icy to be adopted by Her Majesty’s Government is not diminished, but is enhanced, by the appearance of so active a competitor upon the scene. 45. Apart from the recurrent symptoms of activity on the southern and western shores of the Persian Gulf, with which Her Majesty’s Government are laminar, the iurkish Government have also in recent years displayedanincreas- ing interest in its political fortunes. A determined attempt has been made to lortily the shadowy pretensions of the Ottoman Porte to suzerainty over Koweit. A Turkish title has been conferred upon the Sheikh; and forces have more than once been assembled at Basrah for a contemplated expedition against that place. Intrigues are constantly in progress at Bahrein. During 1898 and 1899^ Turkish corvette has been a frequent visitor at Lingah, where, the Sheikh being of Arab descent, Turkish interests are supposed to exist. Finally, the decisions of the Venice Conference and the proceedings of the Sanitary Board at Constantinople have enabled Turkey to claim an interest in the navigation of those waters, of which she has not been slow to take advantage. 46. The only other recent evidences of foreign intervention in the Persian Gulf, of which we are cognisant, are a concession for the pearl-fisheries in that sea, which was given in 1898 by the Persian Government to a Spaniard and a Belgian, under Bussian auspices; and the contemplated appearance at the Gulf ports of customs officers of Belgian nationality, similar to those who have already been placed in charge of the customs houses at Kermanshah and Tabriz, and whose influence, said to be omnipotent at the present moment with the Sadr Azam, is known to be entirely enlisted on the side of Prance and llussia. 47. We have gathered together these symptoms of external, and notably of Russian or of Russophil, interest in Southern Persia and in the Persian Gulf, not because we desire to invest them individually with an importance to which they are not entitled, but because collectively they indicate, in a manner that is not open to misinterpretation, the policy and ambitions of foreign Powers, and because we desire to impress upon Her Majesty’s Government the fact that in an area, by land and by sea, which Great Britain regards with good reason as fallin 0 ’ within her sphere of influence, that influence is being directly and increasingly challenged by other nations, who, in proportion as their foothold becomes more securelv established, will resist any preferential claims, upon what- ever'foundation in history or in fact they may rest, and will claim for themselves an equality of right which in theory it may he difficult to contest. 48. More particularly do these considerations apply to tlm case of Russia, whose advance across the deserts that form a natural harrier o division between Northern and Southern Persia, cannot he regarded with anything hut uneasiness by the Government of India, and the appearance of flag m the Persian Gulf would import a novel element of unrest into a situation that at no time without its anxious features. We desire dehberately to say to ISYour Lordship, with a full consciousness of our responsibility in so saying S difficult as we find it in existing circumstances to meet the financial and ttiat ciimcim a r tlie ever increasing proximity of Russian power r upon a the northern and north-western frontiers of India from the Pamirs to HerTwe could not contemplate without dismay the prospect of Russian neighbourhood in Eastern or Southern Persia the meltable consequence of whi’ch must be a great increase of our own burdens; while the maritime defensibility of India would require to be altogether reconsidered, were the dangers of a land invasion to be supplemented hy the appearance of a possible antagonist as a naval power in waters contiguous to Indian shores. 49 We cannot pretend to divine the future, or to say whether any European Power, and if so which, will at any time push her advance to the point of claiming a maritime outlet in or near to the Persian Gulf. r lhe fate of Mesopotamia lies beyond our ken: audit may be that in the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, some stronger Power may one day exercise dominion at Baghdad, may occupy Basrah, and may demand access for its vessels to the neighbouring waters of the Gulf. Such a consummation, it is in our opinion, &amp; in the interests of British policy, as long as may he possible, to postpone. But upon the question of allowing any European Power, and more especially Russia, to overrun Central and Southern Persia, and so to reach the Gulf, or to acquire naval facilities in the latter even without such territorial connections, we do not conceive that any doubt whatever can he entertained; and we imagine that it will he accepted as a cardinal axiom of British policy that no such development would be acquiesced in by Her Majesty’s^ Government. We would arrive with the greater confidence at this conclusion, since we were lately informed hy Your Lordship that on April 15th of the present year, Lord Salisbury communicated to the Persian Government with reference to rumours of the cession of a port in the Gulf to Russia, that “ Her Majesty’s Government felt it to he their duty to renew the intimation that it would not he compatible with the interests of the British Empire that any European Power should exercise control or jurisdiction over the ports of the Persian Gulf”. 50. Such being the existing situation in Southern Persia, and the prin ciples of policy accepted hy Her Majesty’s Government being as already stated, we pass to a consideration of the manner in which these principles should be translated into action, and of the steps which should, in our opinion, be taken at the present juncture for the protection of the common interests of Great Britain and the Indian Empire. 51. We are aware that, more than half a century ago, there were exchanged, and have more than once since been repeated, certain explicit assurances concerning the integrity and independence of Persia between the Governments of Great Britain and Russia. The first of these assurances were entered into by Lord Palmerston and Count Nesselrode. The former in a despatch, dated. September 5th, 1834, placed on record that “ the Governments of Great Britain and Russia are acting, with regard to the affairs of Persia in the same spirit, and are equally animated by a sincere desire to maintain, not only, the internal tranquillity, hut also the independence and integrity of Persia ”. Count Nesselrode, in despatches, dated October 20th, 1838, and January 29tR 1839, reiterated these pledges on behalf of his Government. gam in 1873 the continued existence of these mutual assurances was referred to with satisfaction hy Count de Brunnow, as reported in a despatch hy Lord GranviUe, dated July loth, 1873. Einally, on March 12th, 1888, M. de Giers in itna e , ijoug i M. de Staal, to Lord Salisbury that the Russian Government in n ° ° ° P ac ^ n £&gt; a S a i n on record that their views on this point are , » rr f 1 ?* . an( ^ a c P mrQU11 i ca ^ on fo the effect that the engagements intpn P mlh?Af B rv! al S a “ d t0 res P ect aild promote the integrity and was aeemffin^l th ® Pe . 1 ' slai ? bmgdom had again been renewed and confirmed, was accordingly made by Sir H. 1).

The first of these is the po icy of a regeneration of Persia by Anglo-Russian means; i.e., joint action by Great Britain and Russia to insist upon reforms, to reorganise*^ the administration and finances, to develop the resources of the country, to lend the requisite means, in fact to convert the Persian Government by combined philantlirofy from a moribund into a solvent institution. This policy was dis cussed and rejected by Sir M. Durand in his Memorandum of September 1895, on the ground that Russia would denounce us to the Shah to begin with, and would play us false afterwards; and in his despatch of Pebruary 1899, he again “ proceeds upon the assumption that we cannot hope to come to terms with Russia, and persuade her to join us in a policy of reform and development.’’ We concur with Her Majesty’s Minister in believing that the reform of Persia by a policy of friendly co-operation between Russia and ourselves is out of the question; and we do so in the main for the reason, which no one familiar with Persia will deny, that Russia is interested not in the reform of Persia, but in its decay; that in the background of her ambitions is the vision of a country and a people falling from inherent debility into her grasp; and that any policy which might tend to strengthen the country or to revivify the people, is to be resisted as tending to thwart the fulfilment of those ambi tions. We might give many illustrations in support of this proposition; but we will content ourselves with one. Sir M. Durand has lately supplied to the Poreign Office the version given by the Sadr Azam of the agreement between the Persian and Russian Governments, by which the former bound itself in 1889 not to grant any railway concessions to any other Power than Russia, except with the consent of the latter, for a period of 10 years. Whatever be the real facts of the case, there can be no doubt that this engagement, as long as it has lasted, and so long as it continues to last, is an effective barrier to any genuine development of the country. It was due to expire in the present year. Our latest information from Sir M. Durand is that it has, under pressure from the Russian Government, been renewed for another term of five years. 54. The alternative policy recommended by Sir M. Durand is that we should plainly intimate that any Russian encroachments in Northern Persia will provoke corresponding measures for the protection of British interests in. the south. In his Memorandum of September 1895, Her Majesty’s Minister suggested that this declaration should be made to the Russian Government. In his despatch of Pebruary 1899 he proposed that it should also be made to the Persian Government; so that both parties should be well aware of the steps that would follow upon any further Russian aggression. It lias been objected to this policy that such an engagement might impose upon the British Govern ment an unwelcome obligation to intervene and to add to British responsibi lities in Southern Persia, at the moment most opportune to Russia, and least opportune to ourselves. There is force in this objection; although we think that it might be met by introducing sufficient elasticity into the pioposed intimation to leave Her Majesty’s Government free to act for the protection of British interests in Southern Persia, not m a specified manner at a speeitie moment but in what manner and at what juncture might commend itself “r judgment. Moreover the value of the Northernit bv the consideration that did Russia take any such s ep urevious here contemplated, counter-action of some sort, with or without a previous j J' 'Iintimation, would in all probability be imposed upon Her Majesty s Government; while the knowledge that a Russian advance m the north might be the signal for a corresponding British move in the south would, it can scarcely be doubted, operate as a deterrent upon any premature activity on the part of Russia, since she might thereby gravely jeopardise the realisation of her own dreams of access to Southern Persia and the Persian Gulf. 55 Nevertheless before we recommend that such a policy should he essayed’ we desire to raise the question whether, though it he impossible to conclude an agreement with Russia for the joint patronage and development of Persia, it might not yet be possible to come to an understanding with her for the separate patronage and development of that country in distinct and clearly defined compartments by the two great Powers, in other words for a recognition of British and Russian spheres of interest in the dominions of the Shah. This is a solution the desirability of which has not been lost sight of by Sir M. Durand, but which for certain reasons he did not feel called upon, to discuss. Recent events in China have familiarised the public mind with the idea of such spheres of interest, although their existence would appear to be still somewhat lacking both in clearness of definition and in precision of outline. The Viceroy has observed in recent telegrams from Lord Salisbury to Sir M. Durand with reference to a Persian loan and to mining concessions in that country, indications of a willingness to concede to Russia liberties in the north of Persia, parallel in scope and substance with those conceded to Great Britain in the south; and it is worthy of consideration whether in an expansion of this suggestion might not be found a feasible scheme. 56. We have already alluded to the line across Persia drawn by Sir M. Durand from Khanikin on the Turkish frontier, through Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman to Seistan, as indicating the northern limits of the sphere within which British political influence and trade are paramount. To some extent this partition is assisted by geographical conditions, the great deserts of Central Persia constituting a natural barrier between the north and the south, and roughly dividing the one from the other. But this situation is modified both in the west of Persia, where there are no deserts, and where there is no physical line of demarcation between the respective spheres of influence; in the centre of Persia, where Ispahan can hardly be said to constitute the natural frontier of any geographical zone; and also in the extreme east where Seistan, the inclusion of which in the British sphere would be an obligatory point, lies not to the south but to the north of the great desert. These con siderations might not affect the success of any engagement that was carried out with equal bona jides by both parties: but they might become a fruitful source of friction were such a good understanding not to be counted upon in the future. In any case, wn would recommend that the line of partition, suggested by Sir M. Durand, should be so far amended as to substitute Kashan for Ispahan. It w r ould be undesirable that any Russian railway should penetrate further south than Kashan, which indeed is separated by a considerable range of hills from Ispahan, or that Russia should have right of access to the very fringe of the latter district. 57. We have observed that in China the Agreement recently concluded between Her.Majesty’s Government and Russia as to spheres of interest has related to railways only. Either party has pledged itself not to seek on its own account or on behalf of others for railway concessions in the rival spiere,. and not to obstruct, directly or indirectly, applications for such concessions, supported by the other in that sphere. JPrima facie there does not appear to be any reason why such an agreement should not equally be extended o mines, roa s, and other industrial* or economic undertakings. The value o sue i an unc ers andmg is considerable; because although political influence p-nfpB-nrr, I ? en .j? ne( ^ ) yet.in eastern countries commercial and industrial 1 s a e ie a j n 1 1 iai a o enc ies through which political influence is exercised infiuence is 4 to follow in the wake of } e. e do not think, if such an agreement w r ere arrived at with[ 19 ] prSTratS^Huef'thar^here 1 would‘aii^end 8 to^•° 1 ' tl ? • nd S0Uth of tlle Persia or in the Persian Gulf Such a relit ^ S1Sns in South ^ engagement that no political inflnce sZId b Ze&amp;L 6 ^ fro “ ^ on the opposite side of the line Thif „ n ® xercise ^ b J either party arrivingVt any such undeZrdtngflceZrid b^oulfl ^ remove the British representatives either at Tphvan + t i -^ e lotion to whose functions necessarily involve the exercl nf TabrlZ ’, or f influence, while a corresponding objection would no doubt bTfeitbv theRussif 1 Government.

Nevertheless Seistan is physically a°nd administratively a part of the province of Khorasan from which it is severed by no clear line of division, the Governorship of Seistan being vested in a member of the old rn mg^family of Kam, the two existing heads of which are brothers, residing respectively at Tabbas and Birjand. It also seems exceedingly doubtful to us whether Bussia would, by any such agreement as we are discussing, forego her designs ujion Seistan itself, and still more her chances of reaching the eastern extremity of the Persian Gulf. Nor again is it clear that she would be willing to cancel the engagement with regard to railway construction, which she has recently renewed with the Persian Government, and to hand over the southern half of Persia to possible railway exploitation by British agency, in return for a monopoly of similar exploitation (which may be said to be already at her disposal) in the northern half. These, however, are considerations which could only be decided by the attitude of Bussia herself, were she approached on the subject by Her Majesty’s Government. We indicate them merely for the purpose of showing that we are far from confident that the suggestion, if put forward, wdll meet with a favourable reception. 59. A more serious drawback, from the point of view of British interests, is the fact that the capital of Persia would lie in the northern or Russian sphere j and that Russian influence there, already predominant, could hardly fail to become supreme. The situation that has recently arisen in China would present itself with ten-fold gravity and emphasis. A desire would not merely be inti mated to connect the capital with the Russian railway system : but a line itself would, we may imagine, at once be made to Tehran, while corresponding lines would in all probability be constructed from the Russian frontier in Georgia to Tabriz, and in Trans-Caspia to Meshed. With the three great cities of Northern Persia thus permanently linked with the Russian, system, the power of pressure exercised by the Russian Government, which is already considerable, would be positively overwhelming. The Shah would tend more and more to become a Bussian puppet, and Northern Persia a Russian proconsulate. We should look wil h great anxiety, in such a case, upon the fate of such institutions as the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the Indo-European Telegraph Department, whose head-quarters are in Tehran. We should fear a marked diminution of influence on the part of Her Majesty’s representative at the capital; and we do not conceal our anticipations that in the long run such a partition might involve the permanent break up of the Persian kingdom, and, if it did not ultimately lead to rival Russian and British ^ Protectorates in the north and south, might at any rate result in the selection of another capital, and in the rule of more than one native prince in Persia. 60. Neither will it be overlooked by Her Majesty’s Government that, while any such arrangement with Russia might preclude that Power from. . j. i nTTov Ponfvnl and Southern Persia and in that way reaching obtaining control over ^ for one momeT1 t retard, hut might on the the Persian Gulf, it same ohiective through Mesopotamia by contrary accelerate her a however, which we do not feel called upon way of Baghdad. Th P would require to he examined on independent SoS nt Nor'ag’Sn would an Anglo-R—_ agreement preclude France, or GmnanV or any other Power from endeavouring to acquire m Southern Persia or in the y Gulf the position from which Russia would ^ hypothec have debarred herself There might even be combined action between them for that object. These however are features inseparable from the solution which we are dis cussing and which should not he of a lormidable character if the influence of the prfncipal competitor were removed from the scene They might be the cafsf of future annoyance to the British Government; but they could hardly, .....lov &lt;,tw conditions, constitute a menace to the Indian Empire. 61 There remains the further danger, distinctly contemplated by Sir M. Durand in discussing the question of a possible understanding with Russia, that she would not abide'by the terms of any such understanding. Sufficient grounds for this induction may unquestionably he found m the history oi Russian advance in Central Asia during the past half century. But an appreciation of the inclinations and idiosyncrasies of both parties to an agreement, in the light where possible, of past experience, is an element in the drawing up of a fresh bargain which is not likely to he lost sight of by.either agent, whether it be reo-arded as involving a discount from, or an appreciation of, the value of the new contract. Moreover such contracts, if not of perpetual duration, or even if ultimately infringed by one of the two parties, have been shown in many cases to be of immense value, in the respite that they afford from the strain of an otherwise ceaseless rivalry, and in the opportunity presented for a peaceful consolidation of existing interests. 62. We have now placed before Your Lordship t\\Q pros and cons, as they present themselves to our eyes, of the alternative policies in Persia. Should Her Majesty’s Government decide upon making any overtures to the Russian Government in the direction indicated, and should they either he rejected, or result in failure, it will still he possible to adopt the alternative recommended by Sir M. Durand. Indeed, if the terms of a reasonable arrangement are proffered by one party, and are refused by the other, the natural corollary would appear to he that the originator of the proposal should reserve to himself the right to protect by whatever means may he at his disposal the interests which he has endeavoured to conserve by friendly co-operation; and should meet what would in such a case he conscious aggression on the one side by retaliation on the other. 63. In either case, however, though still more in the case of a failure to arrive at an understanding with Russia, we conceive that it is incumbent upon Her Majesty’s Government and upon the Government of India to come to an early decision upon the subsidiary question, raised by Sir M. Durand, namely, as to the steps that require forthwith to he taken in order to safeguard British and Indian interests in the so-called British sphere in Persia from the competi tion with which we have shown them to be threatened. 64. Sir M. Durand, in his despatch, has made a calculation of the sums annually expended by Her Majesty’s Government and the Government of India respectively upon the British establishments at present maintained in Persia. He arrives at a grand total of £36,970 per annum distributed in the following proportions: Her Majesty’s Government, £12,876; Government of India, £24,094. . Inasmuch as these figures are not, in all respects, correct, and as they omit several items of charge for which Indian revenues are respon sible, we have made an independent computation, which is here presented, for purposes of comparison in tabular form. In a further column we present the charges also borne by the Government of India and Her Majesty’s Government severally in respect of Mesopotamia and the Tigris— i.e., Turkish Arabia, an area, which though not belonging to the Persian dominions, is so closely adjacent■ • ■ 'i' • ■ [ 21 ] thereto as to constitute a part of the i i ^ nance of British interests in which the GovernmenfoTlndfa hate'Sttierto the'l’ersian Zu t™’ ** C “ ei with ^ tradt and poS 0 ?

According to these figures, which we have been at much pains to verify, it appears that upon the various establishments maintained by the British Government in Persia, the Imperial Government spends £15,466 and the Gov ernment of India £61,052 per annum. If Turkish Arabia be included in the calculation, as we think it must in fairness be, and as it was in a statemei ' prepared for and presented to the Royal Commission on Indian expenditun in 1896, the totals will amount to Great Britain £15,597, India £71,656. 66. It will not, we aj)prehend, be denied that these contributions do not at all fairly represent the respective proportions of Imperial and of Indian interest in Persia and its surroundings. The argument into which we entered in an earlier part of this despatch will have failed in its jmrpose if it has not given good grounds for thinking that in the determination of British interests in Persia too much stress has hitherto been laid upon the Indian, and too little upon the British, quota; and that a more even partition both of responsibility and of financial burden might with reason be adopted in the future. 67. This however is a question which we are not at the present moment called upon to discuss with any minuteness, the more so as it is understood to be one of the subjects that have attracted the attention of the Royal Commission above alluded to, and that are likely to be dealt with in its Report. We observe that in the evidence so far printed and published, some attention has been paid to the case, and we reserve till the appearance of the final Report, any further remarks that we may have to offer thereon. 68. We would observe, however, in strict connection with the question now under examination, viz., the increase of Consular and other establishments in leisia which is itself a branch of the wider subject—that in the reconsider ation of the case for which the Government of India have more than once pleaded, it appears to us that one of two principles may with advantage be borne in view. I he entire charges which are placed upon the revenues of the British Empire for Persia and Turkish Arabia may be added together, and may be divided m certain proportions, to be revised, if neefissarv nt rlAfim'fo in+orvnla[ 23 ] would not be difficult in our opinion to constitute such a partition of interest which would be determined by a combination of geographical, political and commercial conditions. The parts of Persia that border upon Afghanistan, Baluchistan and the eastern end of the Persian Gulf would naturally fall within the Indian sphere. The northern and western portions contiguous to the Caucasian provinces of Russia, to Turkey, and to Mesopotamia, would possess a greater interest for Her Majesty’s Government. To a considerable, though still only a partial, extent this principle has already been acted upon ; whilst it will be in the recollection of Your Lordship that the Government of India have in one case pressed for a vindication of it, which they have felt to be equally demanded by policy and justice. In Pebruary and again in August 1895, our predecessors expressed a very strong opinion that they should not be called upon to contribute towards the Karun service, as long as the subsidy for the mail service on the Tigris was met exclusively from Indian revenues. They stated their opinion that “ the interests involved in the Karun service are purely Imperial and not Indian, and, if this service ceases altogether, the interests of India will not be affected thereby It was only after the receipt of an urgent appeal from the Foreign Office, and on the explicit understanding that the whole question of the distribution of the charges on account of the Tigris and the Karun should be referred to the Royal Commission then sitting^ that the Government of Lord Elgin, not without a vigorous dissent from the then Finance Member, Sir J. Westland, consented to continue the payment of a moiety of the Karun subsidy pending the stipulated decision. We cordially endorse the views which were expressed by our predecessors in respect of the Imperial and non-Indian character of this charge, and we shall be glad to learn what are the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the subject. 70. The mention of the Karun and Tigris services affords an incidental uinc-i-vfitirvn nf the commeicial considerations by which the allocation of respon- may, Are nopt present arrangeI - liunumiHin——■ r f j HU * ! ; ' [ 24 ] 71. We will now proceed to apply the principles which have been enunciated to a consideration of the particular question referred to us by Your Lordship, viz., the suggestions of Sir M. Durand on the one hand, and our own views or proposals on the other, concerning the increase of Consular and other establishments in Persia. We may say at once that we are anxious to regard the question from a broad-minded and liberal point of view, that we have no desire to haggle with Her Majesty’s Government over shares of responsibility or of cost, and that we are quite willing to add to our own charges for the protection of British interests in Persia, in the confident belief that Her Majesty’s Govern ment will not be behindhand with a similar generosity. Our argument as to the magnitude and significance of those interests and the reality of the dangers with which they are assailed would have been insincere, were we unprepared to give to it a practical demonstration. 72. For the sake of clearness we wall divide the country into different spheres, representing with sufficient accuracy the rough lines of demarcation between British and Indian interest. In the northern and central sphere and in the western sphere, the responsibility of Her Majesty’s Government is in our judgment more directly involved. In the eastern sphere, and in the southern or maritime sphere, we admit a corresponding preponderance of Indian interest. 73. Commencing with the first named of these areas, we find that Sir M Durand recommends an improvement in the pay and status of Her Maiestv’s Consul-General at Tabriz. In so far as our judgment on the matter is desired it is in entire accord wfith the proposal. We are more doubtful about the suggestion to appoint an additional Vice-Consul at Tabriz, with the intention of posting him later on at Urumia; since w^e incline to the opinion that the ultimate destiny of the Persian JNestorians has been irretrievably fixed bv their recent wholesale conversion to the Bussian faith. We concur with Sir M urand as to the desirability of reducing the Consulate at Besht to a Vice- Consulate. We have before expressed our hearty concurrence with his pro- posals concerning the Consulate at Ispahan. These proposals without exLp- tion concern m their financial aspect the British, and not the Indian, Kcchequer „ -r V, we , st era sphere Sir M. Durand advocates the appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Kermanshah, subordinate to the Consul-General at Tehran, and paid for by England, in place of the present native agent whose modest allowance of £24 is drawn, for some unaccountable rilsontij the charges for the Meshed Agency, i.e., from Indian funds.

We are sceptical also as to the value received for the large secret service grant a f present made to the Meshed Agency, and expended in the main in pmcurW unreliable and almost worthless information through native and ill-informed agents. On the other hand we are prepared to compensate for a less extrava gant expenditure at Meshed by a more vigilant attention to Seistan, and bv strenuously fostering the trade route connecting that district with British Baluchistan. The political and strategical importance of Seistan appears to us to justify and even to necessitate the former attitude. We are encouraoud to adopt the latter by the figures of trans-Nushki traffic, which have risen from a total of lakh in 1896 to Rs. 5,90,000 in 1897 and (in spite of an adverse season) to Rs. 7,28,000 in 3 898, in which year the imports alone into Quetta from Seistan reached the value of Rs. 2,50,880. 77. We have some time past been examining the question of the permanent appointment of a British officer to Seistan; and the deputation of Captain Sykes from Kerman to Seistan in the present year, and the sanction of an annual expenditure of £400 from Indian revenues upon a Seistan Consulate, have already been mentioned. The reports of Captain Sykes are strongly adverse to the permanent appointment of a British officer to Seistan; and whilst we do not entirely concur with his reasoning, and regard his views as to some extent coloured by other prepossessions, we nevertheless are of opinion that such an appointment might for the present be postponed; the more so as it appears likely that the nomination of a Russian Consul to Seistan, though previously announced, is likely not to be persevered in, unless a British repre sentative appears permanently upon the scene. Should a Russian officer be finally appointed, we think that there will be no alternative hut to send a British officer also. In the meantime we are prepared to depute a reliable native agent from our Indian service to reside at Nasirabad, the capital of Seistan, and to appoint a second to reside at Birj’and, the capital of Kain, both of these officials to be under the orders of the British Resident at Meshed, in correspondence with the Persian arrangements under which Seistan and Kain constitute a portion of the Governorship-General of Khorassan. We estimate that the annual cost of these two posts will amount to £150—£200 per annum more than the already sanctioned charge for the Seistan post; and this addition we are prepared to meet. In making these proposals we have the satisfaction of knowing that we are sure of the support both of Your Lordship and of the Poreign Office; since, in a Revenue despatch, dated December 2nd, 1897, Your Lordship, in sending to us a letter from the Poreign Office, expressing their good hopes of the future of the Quetta-Meshed route, provided that Consular protection and other facilities were furnished at points along the road, com mended these remarks to the Government of India, and added: “I trust thati [ 26 ] the suggestion of appointing Consular Agents at points along the trade route between Quetta and Meshed may receive the attentive consideration ot Your ExceUency’s Government. It appears to me a measure desirable from many S of view, and especially in connection with the facilities which might be afforded by that route for the transport of arms and ammunition between the Persian Gulf and Baluchistan. 78 As regards the trade route in question, we propose to take active measures for its development within our own territory. We contemplate spending addi tional, though not extravagant, sums upon the better provision of wells, accom modation, supplies of fodder and other stores, and the protection of the track We mav even require to appoint a second British officer, to relieve Lieutenant Webb Ware of the excessive strain now imposed upon him by the administration of an extensive district, in addition to the protection of a road over 400 miles in length. We hope by these measures, which will be unostentatiously pursued, to escape* the jealousy aroused by a too open challenge of rival ambitious in Seistan, and to build up in that neighbourhood a substantial commercial and political interest, which will find no mean ally in what we believe to be the natural predisposition of the inhabitants. Experience alone can inform us whether the anticipations that have been framed by the prospects of the Nushki-Seistan trade route are over-sanguine, as in some quarters they are freely said to be. If unsuccessful, the experiment which we now propose to make can be abandoned without discredit. If, as we believe, it will be found to have both a political and a commercial value, we shall be better enabled in the future to pronounce upon the larger schemes which have sometimes been put forward in connection with Seistan, and a reference to which will be found in the Minute written by the Viceroy. At present, it does not seem to us to be necessary to take them into consideration. 79. We agree with Sir M. Durand in thinking that a British Consul should he permanently appointed to Kerman. We have already sanctioned a contribution of B,s. 6,000 or £400 a year to the cost of this post; and we are prepared to continue the payment of this sum. We believe that there are good reasons for which Her Majesty’s Government may desire to continue the pay ment of a similar moiety of the cost. But should their acceptance of the increments proposed elsewhere, notably in the case of the Karim, be facilitated by our assumption of the entire cost of the Kerman Consulate, we should be prepared favourably to consider such a proposal; or, if it were preferred, to divide with them the cost of the Karun and Kerman Consulates combined. The financial result would in either case be approximately the same. 80. Sir M. Durand has suggested a British Vice-Consul, or a native agent at Bampur. Eor the present we think that the latter will be the prefer able alternative; and we are prepared to undertake the outlay, which will not exceed about £300 per annum. The officer in question would be under the orders of the British Consul at Kerman. 81. Einally we come to the southern sphere, including the coasts and ports of the Persian Gulf. Your Lordship will have been prepared by what has previously been said for the announcement of our willingness to submit to some sacrifices for the defence of an interest, so substantially grounded, and so conspicuously assailed.. We are unable to agree with Sir M. Durand in the sug gestion that any material reduction of expenditure can be effected at Bushire. n the contrarv we are disposed to think that, if the best men in our service are to be attracted to that post, we may even require to add to its pecuniary a iactions. V e agree with him, however, in thinking that the Besident at Busin re should reside at Shiraz, and exercise his consular functions there during the summer months. We understand from Colonel Meade that the cost of a a r ° USe being available either for hire or purchase) w £ 1 1 . ,00 ° to £1 ’ 200 &gt; and of building and furnishing about £1,500. j r U ?- p 1118 ex P^ nse l )e borne in equal proportions by the Imperial and Indian Governments; and we are prepared to undertake the annual outlaythat may be required for up-teep and repairs, and for the bving at Busldre! PreSeUt natiVe a§ent ’ during the time that provision of a the Resident is 82 ; Tf f re heal 1 ll y ™ acCOT &lt;J with Sir M. Durand in thinking that a British officer should be appointed to Bunder Abbas, with charge of the Gulf ports cost of Bushire, and of British interests in the maritime provinces of South- eastern Persia. The necessity of such an appointment was mooted, as long a&lt;*o as iS79, by Co,omd Ross, at that time British Kesident at Bushire. It was raised again m 1882 884, 1885,1888 and 1892, and on the majority of these occaSons was supported by petitions from the not insignificant Hindu and Khoja popula tion engaged m trade at Bunder Abbas. In 1893, the appointment as Vice- Consul of an Englishman engaged in business at that port was agreed to bv the Government of India and was sanctioned by the Secretary of State (Lord Kimberley), but was subsequently dropped upon the inexplicable grounds that the estimated cost of Rs. 50 a month or £10 a year could not be saved out of the Bushire Residency funds. In 1*96, the question was again discussed between the Government of India and the Resident (Colonel Wilson); and the former so far departed from their former attitude as to say that the’ proposal must be held over until the normal conditions of trade had been restored by the withdrawal of the Russian sanitary cordon. These conditions have since been fulfilled, and we are prepared to look with a more favourable eye upon a proposal, the intrinsic recommendations of which are not open to dispute. We are willing to accept the financial responsibility for the proposed appoint ment, although we think that it may be possible to meet it without additional cost by the transfer to Bunder Abbas of the Political Assistant now stationed at Meshed. Sir M. Durand suggests that the officer appointed to this post should pass the summer months at Yezd (Bunder Abbas being an impossible site of residence during the hot season), taking the place there of the present unpaid Commercial Vice-Consul. Upon this point we would propose to consult Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, which is in close connection with Bunder Abbas and the coast; and we will submit to Your Lordship at a later date our final views upon this subject. 83. Sir M. Durand mentions, as a matter affecting exclusively the Govern ment of India, the possible appointment of a British officer at Bahrein. We do not hesitate to state to Your Lordship that such an appointment is in our opinion both desirable and obligatory. Trouble, similar to that which we have already incurred in Maskat, is brewing in Bahrein, the treaty engagements of which petty State with Her Majesty’s Government provide no legitimate excuse for such complications. It is necessary to anticipate them by placing a British officer permanently in the island; and we are at the present time awaiting Colonel Meade’s definite proposals on the matter. TVe are inclined to think that it will probably be sufficient to nominate an officer of a sub ordinate class. Lrom time to time he will also visit Koweit. _ It remains to be decided whether he should also have under his political jurisdiction the Trucial Chiefs of the Arab or Pirate coast, or whether these should be placed under the officer at Bunder Abbas. We incline to the former opinion, but reserve this matter for subsequent decision. 84. We have now dealt with each one of Sir M. Durand’s specific pro- nosals 'and have stated our own views in support, in amendment, or m sunnlement of them. It remains for us to mention some additional proposals of our own, and to comment upon certain independent suggestions submitted by Her Majesty’s Minister. W T e entertain, and have already m the present year acted upon, the opinion that Her Majesty’s naval forces should be moie strongly and frequently represented than they have hitheito been m t Persian Gulf and^hat there should be recurrent visits from the Admiral of the East Indian station. During the past spring Admiral the of the Viceroy, paid such a visit and of tl fwi d^ofTe /-ivi-rvino* flip -recent crisis at Maskat. we aie uouuuj-ua yx existing system, under which the political charge of the Makran coast, and t e[ 28 ] distribution of the Telegraph subsidies, is vested in the Director-General of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Ivaiacbi, to whom a special salary of £120 is paid by the Government of India for the purpose. It has been j proposed to us that this charge should be transferred to the Political Agent at Maskat; and for the present we reserve our opinion as to the advantages of such a'change. It would be eminently desirable that 'Maskat should be connected by cable with Jask, since at present there is no telegraphic communi cation with any part of Oman. But this too is a question that must wait for j a later solution. { 85. Sir M. Durand has proposed that all British Consular officers in Persia should have a small guard of Indian troopers similar to those now maintained £ at Meshed. We are not clear that such a proposal is at present desirable, and s are apprehensive that it might lead to movements on the part of Russia, for ^ which not even the necessities of a plague cordon could be pleaded in justifi cation, and which would scarcely be distinguishable from armed occupation. c In this respect we re-echo the opinion which the Government of India expressed s to Your Lordship £is recently as August 10th, 1898, to the effect that Indian £ interests are sufficiently involved to justify us in furnishing protective detach- I ments, as we are now doing at Jask and Charbar, for Telegraph stations on the * coast; but that our military provision must, for the present, be limited to this c service. c 86. Her Majesty’s Minister also recommends the grant of a supply of travelling tents to every British officer in Persia. As the majority of these, under the proposed arrangements, will be upon the Indian list, the suggested outlay would require in such cases to be met from Indian funds. We do not think that any general rule is required. W^e are in the habit of including camp equipment in the outfit of any officer whose duties require him to travel. We may observe, however, that tents are more likely to be required in out-of- the-way parts of the country than they are along the main roads, where the existing chapar or postal service, although destitute of almost every superficial merit, is nevertheless more rapid and therefore as a rule more convenient than travelling by caravan. 87. .uasiiy, sir m. Durand, makes certain recommendations with re^ai to the improvement and better organisation of the Telegraph service in Persi both native and European. We concur with his suggestion that no oppo tranty should be !° st o f getting the Persian wires, which are abominab mismanaged, transferred to our control.

We recognise that there are advantages to British interests generally in maintaining at Baghdad an establishment nf tt, 6 SCal6 f D( ? ° f ™P ortan p e that are associated with an Indian Residency of the second class. But the objects for which such an establishment is there kept up are neither exclusively, nor, as we think, mainly Indian in character. The same remark applies to the Basrah Consulate, where Her Majesty’s Govern- ment have recently taken into their hands the appointment of the Consul while leaving the entire charge to he defrayed from Indian funds. Least of all can such a claim he made for the Tigris subsidy, which, in our opinion, falls into, the category of commercial arrangements properly devolving upon Her Maj’esty’s Government; although under existing conditions the total cost is borne by Indian revenues. We trust that, in any reconsideration of the case, a more generous division of financial responsibility may commend itself to Her Maj'esty’s Government. 89. We have now completed our survey of the proposals that have been submitted to us for examination, and of the situation in Persia as it presents itself to our eyes. In commending our views to the earnest consideration of Your Lordship and of Her Majesty’s Government, we trust that we may have succeeded in impressing upon both, the gravity of the situation with which Great Britain and India are jointly faced, and the necessity, while there is yet time, of meeting it with definite and united counsels. We conclude by reiterat ing the confident hope, already expressed in our despatch of August 10th, 1898, that in the last resort, and in any sudden emergency, we may rely upon Her Majesty’s Government for the protection of interests which are vital both to India and to the British Empire.

I have studied these papers with great interest. The draft despatch practically divides itself into two parts. The first deals with the momentous question of how best to prepare for the break up of Persia, an event which seems the British EnlDire TTictc 1 * , IS . md,s P u ‘ abk . ma / vast and far-reaching importance to ii f .

To discuss a matter of such a different degree of importance as the affirmation of the policy which is to govern tue action of the Empire in a position of snob arnvifv in -inYfarwnoifirm nrifu 1 will explain in Council why this has been done. CftTRZON]. to govern the action of the Empire in a position of such gravity, in juxtaposition with the question of the division of a few thousand pounds between Great Britain and India is, I , ii.ji.j-i. in „ venture to think, incongruous, and I fear is rather calculated to disoract attention from the main and weighty issue. Neither Great Britain nor . . a are ’ trust,, in such a financial position as to make the sum in question an item of any significance by tne side of the other.issue which involves matters intimately connected with the maintenance of our Indian dominion and the security of the eastern trade of the Empire generally on which so considerable a portion of our greatness depends. I venture to submit that, in the first of the two despatches into which I should like to see the present draft divided, it would be sufficient to indicate the general lines on which any expenditure involved in the immediate proposals might be distributed between England and India, leaving the details to be worked out when the general policy to be adopted was finally decided upon. If I correctly interpret the policy which it is intended to enunciate, it is that, while we desire to maintain the integrity and independence of Persia so long as practicable, we recognise the improbablity of the date of the break up of that power being far distant, and we desire, therefore, to now take all suitable means for consolidating our position in the portion of that State which must eventually fall to our lot if we are to maintain our Imperial position in the East. The line selected for the ultimate boundary between Russia and England in those parts appears to be by common consent the Khanikin- Seistau one. It is stated in the draft despatch, however, that under existing conditions we have neither the money nor the men to undertake such a responsibility. May I venture to question this dictum ? Should we adopt in the future such a programme as the absorption of the southern and central portions of Persia up to the Khanikin-Seistan line, it appears to me that the whole position of affairs would be altered. Concurrently with an unquestionably great increase in responsibilities in Persia, we would obtain very important relief in the pressure on our Indian frontier. The strategical position would le entirely changed. Resting on England in the west, India in the east, and the Persian Gulf to the south, we would so threaten Russians advance on India that it seems to me the latter country would, for the time at any rate, he practically safe. Instead of Russia constantly worrying us, she It is an indisputable proposition that neither the Indian army, a&lt; at present constituted, nor the Indian Exchequer, is equal to the stiain of assuming a British Protectorate over the whole of the centre and south of Persia. Nor is it worth while to discuss such a contin gency since no British Ministry is at all likely to autho rise it—at least for many a year to come.

Persia is still an independent country, and is at liberty to sign away her freedom in respect of railways, if she is weak enough to do so. C[ttbzon]. This has been done for years. There is scarcely a caravan tract or route in Persia with which we are not quite familiar. 1 must myself have read the recon naissances of at least 20 young officers specially deputed to Persia for the purpose. C[ttrzon]. The Bakhtiari road is now being made. Concessions for the Tehran-Kum and Dizful-Khorremab.td roads have for years been in the possession of British indivi duals or institutions. But roads do not pay in a country where traffic is solely by camels and mules. Persia is not yet ready for wheeled traffic.

If I arn correct m this surmise, are we wise to give Russia the time and opportunity she wishes? Should we not on our part he at any rate doing what we can to take advant age of the time at our disposal ? Russia does not wait for England when she sees an opportunity, through England being engaged elsewhere or on other grounds, for a move in advance, and I personally do not believe that any action or inaction on our part will seriously delay Russia one day beyond when she is prepared to move. On these grounds I do not myself attach any serious weight to the argument against action on our part of not giving Russia an excuse. Russia, with or without an excuse, will make her advance on the Persian Gulf as soon as she feels herself in a position to. do so. In my view she is probably at present fully occupied so far as railway construction is concerned, and it pays her to hide her time. Imperial ideas also have just now rather the upper hand in England. I do not advocate any direct attempt to build railways in Persia itself at present. It seems to me that our approaches from the West and East may, and should, come first, hut I think by selecting young officers with the necessary qualifications as Vice-Consuls, &amp;c., and allowing them to march about and thoroughly investigate the subject in a quiet sort of way under colour of opening out trade routes, &amp;c., we could obtain valuable reconnaissances of the various routes, and in a few years have ample details at our disposal from which to lay down our projects when the time comes for their execu tion. Where it was practicable also to start road-making, we might ensure that the roads would fit in with our railway schemes hereafter, and any extensions of telegraphs might also be adapted to the railway policy of the future. All this might he done in connection with the consolidation of our position in the southern and central portions of Persia which we look to as some day to come under our control without taking any more open or definite steps than we are apparently prepared to do at present. Your Excellency, in the draft despatch, writes that we are already in a position to judge of the railways very few in number that under existing conditions it would he prudent, if it were possible, to construct in Persia. I understand Your Excellency recognises as the line of the Possibly, hut a remote future. future the K hanikin-Seistan route, and that this C[tjrzon]. might be connected with the Persian Gulf (1) at Bushire and (2) at Bunder Abbas, or some point further to the eastward. (I write from recollection of the views expressed in Your Excellency’s book which unfortunately 1 have not got by me to refer to.; W T ith such a definite scheme in their minds, our officers could quietly obtain all the details necessary for the prepara tion of a reliable project, the detailed execution of which would afterwards he a simple matter parti- With the exception of a few lines (and I am doubtful about that), no British Company will dream of con structing railways in Per.-ia without either a British or an Indian guarantee.

His report, concurred in by Mr. Pitman, is entirely unfavourable. He estimates the initial cost of such a line at Es. 11,40,700, the annual charges at Es. 1,16,800. C[urzon]. culminating in ihe construction of a railway. In this policy I venture to express my entire concurrence. As part of it I presume we should have before long a light inexpensive line of telegraph, and it seems to me that the opening of such a line (following the alignment of the railway of the future) might well be made the excuse for bringing under our control the tele graphs of Eastern Persia, and putting into an efficient state, by advice, free supervision and judicious supply of materials, their connection with the European managed lines to the west and with the Persian Gulf lines to the south. As a means of consolidating our position in the country without any very great expenditure or display, this line of action, which is more or less suggested in the papers, would undoubtedly be of great value. To the westward, that is between the Mediterranean and the Persian frontier at Khanikin, it would seem possible to do a good deal. The revival at home of the interest in the Baghdad railway project now noticeable in the public press gives us an opportunity. The endeavours that are being made, both by ourselves and others, to obtain the control of the telegraphs through Mesopotamia and down to the Persian Gulf afford also another opening. In my humble opinion both are matters of great Imperial interest, and I cannot look on any chance of the control of the country to the north-west of the Persian Gulf passing into the hands of any strong Power as otherwise than a serious menace to our interests, both Imperial and Indian. From the latter point of view, the growth of the Indian export trade concurrently with the growth of the new Indian industries, tea, jute, cotton, coal, &amp;e., which is a marked feature of the present stage of our Indian Empire, compels us, I consider, to lay great stress on the importance of keeping open and extending the markets for the products of these industries. In this connection the maintenance of our supremacy on the shores of the Persian Gulf and the safeguarding and spread ing by all practicable measures of the markets for our goods in Persia and Asia Minor, seems to me a matter of the very highest importance. From these remarks, it will be gathered that I do not lay any great weight on the Euphrates valley system of railways in the narrow light of its forming an alternative, more or less overland, I agree. C[urzon]. route to India, but that I view it as a means both strategically and commercially of holding on to, and opening out, the markets of the vast area they would serve to the trade of Great Britain from the West and our Indian Empire from the East. Tbe reference in tbe despatch is to tbe possible acqui sition by Powers other than Eussia of a position in Southern Persia and the Gulf—not in the western sphere, i e., Turkish Arabia. But this may be made clearer, and tbe paragraph can be strengthened. CftrnzON]. On this account I venture to deprecate the tone of paragraph 60 of the draft despatch which, I submit, scarcely gives the weight that should be attached to the western portion of the subject under consideration. The only other remark I would wish to make is that paragraph 62 seems to me to be J wanting in any definite expression of opinion on our part. We place the pros and cons before the Secretary of State, but do not clearly state the course of action we recommend.

However looking to the masterly analysis of Imperial and Indian interests in Persia in this draft to the striking disproportion between the Imperial and Indian contributions m Persia and Turkish Arabia now revealed, and to the fact that our demand for a revision of this expendi ture is likely to be powerfully supported by Lord Wei by's Commission it is not improbable that the policy now advocated will result in some immediate saving to India. In connection with the question of revision, it is important to determine what principle shall govern the division of financial responsibility between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. Two alternative principles are proposed— (1) The whole cost of diplomatic, consular, naval, telegraphic and other charges in Persia and Turkish Arabia might be divided in some fixed proportion. (2) The Imperial and Indian Governments might, respectively, accept responsibility for those areas in which Imperial or Indian interests predominate, with a joint contri bution towards the central (Tehran) establishment. There are arguments on either side; but I incline to the latter arrangement, if it can be carried out. My reasons are that, if India were responsible for the Indian area—which would, I take it, include Seistan—any action to be taken could be taken more quickly and more quietly. That is chiefly a political reason, though there is much to be said for having our contribution entirely within our control. And, financially, references to London for increasing any part of a total contribution divided in fixed proportions would be troublesome. Moreover, if, in an very likely find it difficult to get the Home I quite agree with Mr. Dawkins’s preference, and aho with his reasons for arriving at it. 1 would add another, viz , that the second arrangement is far more likely to he accepted by the Home Government than the first. I am willing to add a paragraph as suggested. On the other hand, it must he remembered that under the second plan India will certainly have to pay more (and pro bably in an increasing ratio) than under the first.

Possibly some argument in this direction could be introduced into paragraph 69 of the draft. I may illustrate my contention by a reference to such expenditure as the Quetta-Seistan route may entail. Such expenditure must, I think, grow in a tentative and gradual manner and by small amounts at a time. I had hoped to be able to append to this note some remarks on the figures given in the draft of the Imperial and Indian shares of the existing expenditure. These figures are being cheeked and examined in the Finance Department, but I regret that the process is not yet finished, and I did not like to delay this note further. If 1 have any remarks to make, I will submit them separately. They will not, in any case, touch the principles laid down in the draft. C. E. D [awrists], —7-9-99. I quite concur in the policy outlined, and have no criticism to offer on the details. I should* like to have some further information on the military part of the question : say, a note showing the bases from wdiich, and the lines along which, we can move troops towards the Persian frontier. Perhaps the Military Members of Council can explain this part of the case. * I do not think that a note will he required.

If Russia were to be allowed to occupy Northern Persia, including Khorasan and its provincial appanage, Seistan, the independ ence of Afghanistan would be threatened, the outposts of the Russian and British armies would ere long; confront each other on the frontier of Baluchistan, and a great portion of Western Afghanistan would be ready to fall an easy prey to the advance of Russia. Some of the drawbacks of the policy suggested are stated with great impartiality, force and clearness in the despatch, but I venture to think that there are other conditions which may be indicated, and I ask to be permitted to lay these before His Excellency and my colleagues for their consideration. \\ e will assume, for the moment, that Russia assents to the arrangement proposed. She can employ her energies in the development of Northern Persia and in pushing roads and rail ways, and in all the numerous activities which would then be within her scope. We, on the other hand, would be equally empowered to pursue a similar policy south of the line Khanikin- Kermanshah-Kashan-Yezd-Kerman-Seistan. 1 do*not think it requires any large prophetical powers to foretell what would, most probably, come to pass. lu the northern sphere of influ ence the military power of Russia would become predominant, Russian trade might indeed be further developed; but the great aim would be to strengthen the strategic position, so that, when the time comes, an irresistible advance, backed by all the resources of Khorasan, could be made upon the Herat province. It will be said that we should have strengthened our military position in way in the Southern Zone. 1 doubt it. It is not our practice to spend large on the development of a country with a view to those strategical advantages which are not infrequently regarded as the dream and fantasy of the soldier. The money would not come at first from England—where such enterprises would immediately and very readily be denounced as barren and profitless undertakings. Could it be supplied from India? I do not think so, unless it had to be produced under some overwhelming feeling of alarm, unless the Govern ment of this country and Her Majesty’s Government were convinced that some present and extraordinary danger had to be confronted. I do not for a moment deny that Southern Persia or the southern “ sphere of influence', mi^ht not be considerably developed. Cultivation might be increased and agriculture improved; the cotton and tobacco industry would be fostered; the revenue derived from opium increased; mineral production might be augmented and the various manufactures of silk and woollen tissues would receive the impetus of water or steam power. The roads would be made better and safer, and, in course of time, even railways for commercial objects might be introduced. The material advantages which would result to Southern Persia and to our trade should not he minimised, but they will be of little value in checking the onward progress of Russia in our sphere of influence in Asia, unless railways were made not only in Seistan, hut from the Gulf ports, so that from our sea base we could operate expeditiously against her advance towards our Southern Zone—an advance she would certainly make at some time or other—-or threaten her a corresponding sums of money iAjy* DU UJtrr lJ C&lt;rvr ^ ■ go .

After discussin S the lines of policy open to Her 1 ajesty s Government and expressing their opinion in favour of an understanding (if possible) with Russia regarding the British and Russian spheres of interest in Persia, the Government of India make certain specific recommendations some of which are financial and others of a political character. Ihe proposals discussed in paragraphs 73, 74, and 75 involve expendi ture from Imperial revenues, and are matters for the consideration of the Foreign Office before any opinion on them can be expressed by the Secretary of State for India. With respect to the Karun subsidy, referred to in paragraph 75, lam to invite attention to the letter from this Office of the 31st October last. The proposals (in paragraph 87), relating to the extension of telegraph lines in Southern Persia form the subject of separate correspondence with the Foreign Office, concluding with the letter to the Foreign Office of 12th December. The other proposals of the Govemment of India are contained in paragraphs 76 to 83 inclusive, and include the improvement of the Nushki-Seistan route, the permanent establishment, subject to certain financial arrangements, of a Consul at Kerman with a Native Agent at Bampur, and the measures designed to strengthen British influence in the Persian Gulf and on its littoral.

Of the recommendations contained in paragraphs 80 to 84, his Lord- ship is of opinion that only two, viz., the establishment of a British Officer at Bahrein and the appointment of a Political Assistant at Bunder Abbas, are of immediate importance, and he proposes to take steps for giving effect to them. In regard to the Bahrein appointment, the Secretary of State for India awaits a reply to my letter of the 15th ultimo, and on receipt of it the Government of India will lose no time in forwarding their final and detailed proposals for establishing a representative on that island.
