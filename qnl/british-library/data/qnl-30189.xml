There are further reports of robberies in outlying villages in the Bandar ibbas district- Be onoua ic C ond it io ns 0 There is little improvement in the wheat situation which remains virtually the same as reported in the last Summary* Kerman town was never actually without some bread each da;/ but there were many days on which the supply was both short and poor in quality* •* scheme which has proved popular and should be a great help to the poorer people for whom it is mainly intended, is the sale at selected shops of 'ash 7 * * * 11 - a cooked mixture of meat, wheat, rice (or other cereals) beans and any other available vegetables, which is bein^ sold at 12 shahis a chorak(abc.ut lbs)* This with one bread will provide a man with sufficient fooa for one day ••• at a cost of one rial^ two shahis 0 The first day 'ash' was on sale as a trial 2000 people were served and ss many more were turned aw?;/, TT ov sufficient is made for 4-5000 persons daily* It ensures that a poor person can fill his belly at low cost with nourishing food and should, at the seme t imo ? reduce the demand on bread to some extent.,. The only trouble is the middle class people find this 'ash' is so good they too want to buy it.. The sale of 'ash' is the beginning of cheaper food sponsored by the nsvl^ formed fherkat-i Kharbar (co-operative society) the subscribed capital of which, lodged in the bank, is nov.' over one million rials (para 6 wo.12) ttocks of other foodstuffs such as beans (from Isfahan) rice (from llazanderan) and roughan etc are being acquired preparatory to opening cheap food shops * Until the cheap food shops are opened, the cost of living will remain at a. high level to fill the pockets of the profiteers« There has been a slight fall in the price of rice which is now rials 24 to 28 per man (6g lbs) against 2S to 32^ accoraing to quality a In Yezd there is little improvement in food prices. Here local officials talk a lot but do little* Unsatisfactory reports about conditions in Bandar sbbas are receiving attention# The acting list and ar will visit that town in the near future to see conditions for himseli„ -fter considerable pressure by II.H’s Consul a three- months sugar ration has been issued to the people of Kerman, at the rate ox 1 ^ kilo per month# Figures extra.cted from the local economic department revealed that as far back^ as six weeks ago there were over 100 tons of sugar in stock but none was issued until a few' days moo although further stocks had been received in the meantime. BkH's Consul nas asked to be supplied with figures of sugar stocks fortnightly in future and' if he has anything to do with it the people will get their monthly eugar ration on due date in future. The acting Ustandar inspected the bazar a few aays ago and ordered vendors to sell fruit cheaper- For some days little fruit was brought into the bazar buu it is tnoug-t that vendors will have to climb down over this commodity as it will not keep. Some people seeing: pictures ox 'V' sign with his fingers say it means they should be given two breads a day 5 r r Churchill ^making the Hr Churchill orders the present ration is one. 7 .

It is understood that 3000 khnrwars (about tons) have been allotted to Kerman from the Zabul surplus but Zabul i-oad is-ior has been) inundated ana is unlikely to be fit traffic for another fortnight. Meanwhile the daily bread supply Kerman town is kept going only by day to day collections of wh- with such transport as can be secured. This haphazard existence likely to continue for another three or four weeks. In Banaar Abbas the bread situation is far from gooa and the. attention of the acting Ustandar has been arawn to reported condi tions there © There is no change m the situation at Yezd, but there is more money in this town and the people can get enough to eat by paying for it© There is however a fair supply of good fruit now available at most centres, and. in the case of Kerman, at reasonable prices after initial friction with the vendors© Meat too is more plentiful in the Kerman bazar of late and prices are moderate. Some unscrupulous butchers attempted to extract higher prices by spreading a. rumour that the Consulate was buying 100 mans of meat per day. It is satisfactory to report that this and similar reports of alleged Consulate purchases were. suit ably dealt with by the Editor of the •’Bidari' on his own intiatiue* The sale of ?i ashH in Kerman continues to be very popular and there is a big demand for it.

Those who take the'”trouble to think realise that the almost continuous destruction , ained upon Germany by the R*A.F. must ha ; e some effect, upon the enemy f s war machine but it does not fire t.he imagination so strongly as a. spectac- ular advance on the grounds, And it is some time now since the Allies hud occasion to hang out the flags for such an occasion. SometMng of this kind is needed to revive the drooping spirits of limited experi ence who are incapable of viewing the war situation as a whole* The Editor of ^Bidari” published a very outspoken article on local conditions and local government. H.M’s Consul thought it necessary . while complimenting’ tne Ed it, or on his courage in bringing these facts to notice to advise him against using language which might tend to excite the public mind undiuy and lead to a disturbance of the peace* — ^ Shi ppingo The 3»S« Kingyuan which arr ived at Bandar Abbas on the l?th to discharge 2402 cases of tin for the Canning Factory was delayed until the 19th owing to inadequate unloading arrangements at the pier and insufficient number of lighters.

The number of private bread shops in the town has increased from six to fourteen which seems to indicate that more wheat is being released to private purchasers. A mining company has been formed in Kerman under the name of ’Shirkat-i-Zagal-i-Sang’ (the coal company) with a contract with the Central Government to mine coal for ten years from the Koh-i-Badumnieh about 7 farsakhs North West of Kerman.

The attached papers amplify our knowledge, but do not suggest that he is a very serious menace either to Allied interests or to the security of this part of Persia.

I bth directed by Hie Majesty’s Minister to transmit to you herewith a copy of a telegram to His Majesty’s Consul at K2RMAIT and of the text of the guarantee to which it refers, 2. Hussain Khan Buchakchi has been for some time sus pected of maintaining relations with German agents and of being concerned in anti-Ally movements in 2 outh Persia# There were unconfirmed reports that he had harboured two Germans and passed them on to the Tashgai. He has recently been making attempts to get into touch with British authorities and Major Phillips, The Security OTicer in Bast Persia under the Government of India, who has seen his wife end another intermediary, has come to the conclusion that Hussain Buohakchi now regrets having been drawn into anti-British intrigues. Buchakchi claims to have been led astray by General Siapush, at one time comman ing Persian Forces in KSRMAN and on the retired list for the past twelve months, and Hasir Qashgai. 3. Hussain Buchakchi was well known to the Couth Persia Rifles at the end of and after the last war as an active and troublesome brigand. Of latter years it seems that he has not himself been active in brigandage, although his tribe maintains its reputation for lawlessness. It consists of about 2,000 families inhabiting the mountainous district immediately Bast Of GIRJAH on the UHBAR-ARBAGAvRMAN road. It is doubtful whether Hussain now ex€rcises control over the whole tribe. 4. His Majesty’s Minister decided that nothing was to be lost and something might be gained by giving a guarantee in the terms of the text enclosed. 5.

Confident! al, Ho,5-T British Consulate. KERMAN 6 th March, 1945* dir » I have the honour to refer to the correspondence resting with this office T.L*No.4-T dated the 15th ’ebruary, 1.943, re garding Hussain Than Buchakchi. K- G, The assurance wich, as already reported in ny telegram TTo.39 dated 14th February I gave to Akbar Khan son of Hussain Khan, was a verbal not a written one. My reasons f r withholding the ^ vjritten assurance at that time were (l) because of the General Offic er Commanding’s objection to the giving of a written assurance ( re ported in ry telegram No.37 dated the 11th February) and (2) in order to have something in reserve to use as a ''urther inducement &amp;f necessary. The first objection vanished as a result of further discussion with the Governor-General before ny depar Bare, in which he informed me that he saw no objection to a written assurance being given, that He had persuaded the General Officer Commanding to take this view, and t at in fact beth xi 3 i he and the General Officer Co mending had given guarantees in writing on be' alf of the Iranian Government. I went to SIRJAN therefore prepared to give a written assurance if I considered there ’ oul' be an advantage in doing so. 3. I was in SIRJAN on two occasions, on my way to and from BANDAR cBBAl. On both occasions I had discussions with the principal officers and others, and it was not long before I was compelled to agree with Major Phillips’ vi w of them. I have rarely 'Bt such an unattractive set of rogues and liars, ith regard to Hussain Khan there appear to be two main views, possibly correspond!ng with the two parties which are said to exist in the town,si) - 3 - 4. (a) Booim ;, r'el r rh^ first vi^w is that Hus a in Fh an is an nnprinciplsd r*. If not hi ns elf n rotifer on this point there are interesting divergencies of opinion) he is re sponsible through his followers for nont of the robberies that occur. The excuse that he is afraid of the British tovemnent is a blind. This view was put forvard by Thank at, the trusted adviser of the General Officer fonnanding. lrani an \ on variant Oonnany of this view in held by Anveri, the Anglo- spent. wh' considers that all the officials including the G n ral Orficer Ch landing are partners with Hussain Than in looting the countryside* There appears to be general agreement that the junior off icials at least are hand in glove with the ro bers and that it would be impossible to clean up t e position satisfactorily with the present n-endar-terie. 6 . ri his party was further of opinion that a written assurance won Id be of no nee. Pf1 he reason advanced for this view was that it would give Hussain t*h«n an increased sense of his own importance and make hin more obstinate than ever. The real reason v/an possibly that some at least of my informants reap a rich Trofit from the robbers and have no wiah to see 'mssain Khan reconciled v/ith the authorities. 7 . (b) The oth r main view is that Hussain Khan is genuinely afraid of the British Government. He is an opium addict, nervous and excitable, and surrounded by bpd advisers who persuade him not to listen to the advice even of his own son Akbar vhan. His champions (e.g. kbnr Khan and Paji Kotamned) maintain that he is not a robber and not responsible the robberies. Another view (Firoz Bin, British subject) is that he does rob or allow his followers tc^ rob, but this is not due to his own inclination: he is incited and black mailed into it by the local officials and others who wish to share in the proceeds c the very persons who pay be putting forward view (a) above* n. It ie Hfficult to arrive at the truth between these conflicting views. On 'y way down I raw Akbar F’han again and ik- ■nressed on him that he should convey the verbal assurance to his father and uernuade him to come to Ker tan, and make his peace* Akbnr Khan, I tl i^k, is genuinely grateful for the consideration shown to his famil but doubtfrl of his ability to influence his lather. On my -ay bock I saw first the recently appointed Com mander of the garrison Colonel B-hrami. Unlike sc many oi the officials ho took the view tb-t a written guarantee might turn the scale. I t)i§n saw Haji Potammed (in the temporary absence was informed that Hussain Khan was still moving though he h^d rt ore time come 'Tuch nearer to to a possible interview with me* Having first ob' sin-ad from Fuji Mot ammo &amp; an a dirt ssion that if I wrote to Hussain Khnn on behalf of the British Government there would be nothing further to -o^^vent his coming into Kerman, I delivered to him th.a written assurance, which I had urepared, to be con' , ^eyod tc Hussain 'than, in a slightly amended form vide Appendix 1. He declared that the assurance was entirely satisfactory, and that he would do his best to nersuade Hussain T 'han to come in. Q, Whatever the t~uth about Hussain ’'ban’s state of mind and activities T consider that we shall not lose by this line of action. Tf he is genuinely anxious tc come tc terns and has only been dis suaded by bad and malfcious advisers he will now know i n ea^wact. Tf, on the other h*&gt;nd, he ^refers to Continue as an outlaw *nd robhef he will noon break the conditions of our a a mi ranee to hi-, an* we shall he in a strong position to press the Persian authorities to round, him up.

As briefly reported in my Diaries for the second half of March and the first half of April the General Officer Commanding Gartip Kaifcavual finally decidea to send Sarhang (Colonel) Yazdanfar Commanding Officer German Garrison, to Sirjan to try and reach a final settlement of the Hussain .Khan affair • Whatever may have been the Girt ip* a personal motives, this was the best possible choice as the Gar hang is an effic-' lent oif icer trained at Gt ^yr and so far as is Known has not hitherto been involved in local intrigues. He left for Sir Jan or April 5th. Ihe Ustandar (Governor—General) gave him over riding authority over all the local officials. * Cn April 15th Carlas-iKar (General) Jahanbani arrived in Kerman to inspect the Kerman Division. V*hen I called on him the next day, I made a point of emohasilig, in the presence of Sartip Kaikavusi, the importance which the British Government attache a to the maintenance of security on the Bandar Aobas road. He and tne Gar tip visitea Sirjan on ths as uhay said, a plan ofjeampaign. following day to draw up, 4* fhus the conditions were very favourable for reaching a final decision of the Buchanchi question. Not only had a senior officer* s at .ention been drawn to it, but any interest the tip hiiiisei f may or ma,v not have had in prolonging un settled conditions for his own profit vanished with the news of his transfer wnicharrivea with the Garlashkar. G«rhang Yazdanfar returned to Kerman on April 2 hth and at once called at this Consulate. He said he had come to ti.e conclusion tna t Hussain Khan is not himself a robber, but tnat other persons h^ve been committing and organizing robberies m name (i.e. he inclineu to tne view expressed in paragraph 7 fb) of my despatch No.5-2 dated the 6 th March 1943). Those chiefly responsible ware the local civil officials, and especially the late Wiie f of the Gendarmerie Sarhang Sarbaz, since dismissed. He saia he had therefore recommended to the Ustandar that all the heads of the civil Departments ana the Gendarmerie officers (including Sarbaz*s Acting successor GarwanMir Hussaini) should be charged, and that the Ustandar had agreed to this. He added that the countryside had quietened down, that only one robbery had oeen committed w: list he was there, uni that the culpr its had been caught and the property recovered. ^8 r egar ds Hussain Than he was convinced that the man was still nervous o f the intentions of the British Government towards him. He revealed that HaJ i Mohammed had not forwarded to Hussain Khan the assurance I had given him for delivery - for reasons hitherto unexplained but which I have asxed the Garhang to investigate. Ihe Sarhang had however himself met Hussain Khan, at a olace appointed by the latter, and given him ly written assurance; an d he brought bacx ana delivered to me a reply from Sir Reader W. Bullard, '.Gy His Majesty’s Minister, TEHRAN. Q.I.h., / Hussa in2 Huasain Khan aoknowledginp ita receipt ana expresalng thanks. Husanin T Oian had 'oade one roq-uest, that the sentence in para graph ( 2 ) of the assn ran ca should be altered from “that neither you nor....” to read “that neither your tribe nor....” as, the present reading implied that the himself had engaged in robbery. 7. On this latter point I con suite a the Ustandar this Nsprning and we agreed that as the 'tribe* inoludod Hussain Chan himself, I might make the amendment in the interests of a settlement, fhr Uotandar also confirmed that he had agreed to change the local officials, am was referring to lenran for approval. Ho added that he would be grateful for the support of H.M’s. Legation in obtaining early sanction of the proposed trans fer s. Sarhang Yazdanfar proposes to return to Sirjan shortly. He is confident &amp;hat he will be able to persuade Hussain Khan to come into Kerman before long, and that he will be able easily to deal with the miner robbers who have been disturbing the countryside, provided that their supporters among the officials are removed. It is to be hopea tint these are not mere words. A-t least the prospects of a settlement are oetter than they have oeen for some time. 9.

On 13th September, 1943, Aqai Ahmad Rad, Governor General of Kerman, receive orders of transfer to Tehran. Aqai &lt;eza Fahimi, the Governor Kerman, has been appointed as acting Ustandar in addition to his present duties. Aqai Ahmad r.aa*s departure is widely regretted by all sections of the community. He is popular with all classes and has always been ready to cooperate with this Consulate and with M&amp;jor Hassan, the Consular Liaison Officer and has helped the C.M.3* Mission on many occasions. Genex*al comment is that ne is no longer youn^aid rather weak. He is, however, honest and a loyal friend of the British and his removal has come as a surprise, in spite of the well known fact that he does not get on well with the Prime Minister. Military Affairs. In accordance with recent orders from Tehran the •Tip* (Brigade) in Kerman has been abolished, and all units under its control have been transferred to the control of the Kerman •Lashitar* (Division). As a result, officers of the Brigade now without posts, have been transferred to Tehran. The following officers have left (i) Sarhang Haidari, (ii) Sarhang Yazdanfar, (iii) Sargourd Fayuzi, Staff officer to Colonel Yezdanfar. Commander of gendarmerie.

It is rumoured that AQai Lawasani, Chief judge of Ke.man, is aoout to be transferred to Tehran, and that Aqai liurtaza Tlahawandi is to relieve him. The latter has been the Chief Judge of the Court of 1st Instance in Kerman. Security. (1) Vo case of robbery on the roads has been reported. (ii) The Gr.O«C. informed His Majesty’s Consul that he had received reinforcements from Khwash and was now ready to deal with Hussain Khan Buchakchi. He said however that he would c ,ive Hussain Khan a final chance to surrender his rifles. If Hussain Khan did not come in, the G.O.C. would take action. The G.O.C. was told that sartip Kaikavousi made similar decla rations and nothing more was done. He replied that he was determined to settle Buchakchi affairs before the winter.

Intrigues have started again and feelings are running high at what is considered unjustifiable interference by the Minister of Interior. It is considered by some people not unlikely that the elections have been stopped on the pretext that Aqai Hsu is known to be ^ personal friend of Aqai Kazimi. Some people consider it to be the handiwork of Aqai Dabistani, the present deputy, and Muyyid Ahmadi another candidate. (2) Bam. The Farmandar, supported by the Rais-i-Gendarmerie are openly supporting Dr. Malikzaoeh. The Farmandar has announced publicly,. that he was appointedjby the Prime Minister to see Malikzadeh elected.

The final result of the operations against j/ K - £ Hussain Khan Buchakchi is still awaited. Latest reports show that Hussain Khan had come back to within about 30 miles of Sirjan, ana that the operations of the Persian army had appar ently been suspendeu to celebrate the Shah's birthday. The £.0*C« has however since returned to Sirjan, ana it is hoped that some decision will be reached. Hussain Khan's wife is in Persian hands. The rival banait Muraa Ali Murad was expected to surrender shortly. 3/8. Meanwhile there has been a recruacscence of robbery both on if the Yeza road and in the Jupar area. Two lorries anu a car containing a Russian Engineer and his wife were held up at SHAMSH between Anar ana Kermanshahan on the Yezd road, on October 27th. The passengers were taken into the hills, and r looted of everything except the clothes they were wearing. His Majesty's Consul's chauffeur happened to be a passenger on one of the lorries, ana suffered considerable losses. He and othewmade an immediate report to the nearest gendarmerie post at Kerman shahan, but n, action seems to have been taken. On the chauffeur^ arrival at the Consulate the matter was immediately reported to the G.O.C., who has promised to pursue the robbers energetically. There were 11 men with rifles. It is not known where they came from.Elections. 4 / — 379. The order postponing the Kerman elections has now been cancelled, and the formalities are proceeding. Presumably ^qai Hashemi and Aqai Kazemi will be declared elected. 380* TTo progress has been made in Bam. Economic Conditions. 381. (a) Kerman . In Kerman conditions are satisfactory. The steady flow of grain into the ambars continues, and the transport situation has eased. During the period under reporr the receipts amounted to 157 tons ox wheat, and 186 tons of barley, ana on November 1st the stocks in the Kerman ambar stooa at 425 tons of wheat and 665 tons of barley. 382. The Consular Liaison officer has almost finished the revision of the coupon system. Many frauds were discovered, and it is hoped that the total of coupons issued will not amount to more than 37,000 (as opposed to 46,000 before). Loaves given out from the municipal bakery to officers* families have also been reduced from 20*00 to 1000 - some indication of the profit that formerly went into^pockets of the officers concerned. 383. Complaints are heard scout the quality of the Government bread. This arises from the fact that, while for three days of the week it is made of pure wheat, on the remaining, four it is pure barley. The complaints relate to the barley days. It is hoped to be able to devise a system by which the municipality will be able to issue barley and wheat flour 1 ready mixed for each day. 334. The prices of some commodities continue to rise. Eggs for instance have risen from Rials 1.25 to Rials 1.50 each and mutton from Rials 26.6o to Rials 28.3 per kilo. Cigarettes are scarce and dear, and charcoal is almost unobtainable, ^he prices fixed by the municipality are not effectively Enforced. 385. (b) Yezd. Conditions in yez i are far from satisfactory. Coupons have not been issued except to Government employees, and though the richer people can now bring in wheat for themselves from the surrounding villages, the poor cannot afford to do this and are already hard pressed. Government stocks stand at 176 tons of wheat and 270 tons of barley. Import of further supplies is urgently required so that a reserve can be built up ana the coupon system for the poorer classes resumed.Local \ffairs. British Consulate, Kerman. 4th November, 1943. H.M. the Shah»s birthday was suitably celebrated both in Kerman and Yezd by receptions and sports, in Kerman after the sports the foundation stone was laid of a new gymnasium. It is to be hoped that this will meet with a better fate than that of the hospital which still has no super-strueture. propaganda. Allied victories have proved to be better propaganda than all the paper and talh of the past. The clerk in charge of the Consulate office in yezd, profiting by the tide of Allied victories, collected no less than eleven thousand Tomans in five days for H.d. the Viceroy 1 s \&gt;Var purposes Fund. * I * 0 * s •, His Majesty*s Consul, Kerman.

In an encoun ter near ^Irjan tan. bandits were reported by the General Officer Commanding /-Commanding to have heen captured# Correct info unation about the results of such encounters is difficult to obtain, as the ^-ilita* y are very reticent about their own losses.

Hence the last minute decision to obtain barley through undertakings but the possibility of ob- -taining it from laadlords at gov«*nment controlled prices is very remote. On the other hand, it is said that assessments of wheat for purposes of obtaining undertakings have been so lenient aM favourable to landlords that wheat collections this harvest will be less than half the amount brou^t in last year and it is believed that Kerman province, as a result, will be seriously short of grain by the eiri of the year. -“Meanwhile Kharbar officials, under the pretence of doing their duty, are engaged in heated disputes with landlords who blankly refuse to give undertakings for barley on the grounds that Tehran’s de- -cision to do so came too late# it may be safely assumed however, that this is just another major ’ramp’ iu which Hharbar officials and landlords are in complete agreement# 252* Under orders from Tehran the local Cotton Apartment has been abolished and their stocks have been locked and sealed until instructions for their disposal are received# There is no further government monoi^oly on cotton and cultiva- -tors are free to sell their products in the open market which it is expected will bring the price of this commodity within the reach of all# 253# There has been an unusual demand for Kerman carpets by dealers in Tehran and the price per Kerman ’zar’ has risen from Kials 600/- to Kials 1000/- in the last few days# 254* Reference para 233.
