St. G. 327. 34 *. Heraission of sentence is referred to in s.U of the C.P* Removal Act, and also in s*8. Section 4 is irrelevant for present purposes. The qualification at the end of s.8(l) I think only reserves a power of remission to the authority which would have had that power if the prisoner had not heen removed. The opening clauses of s*8(l) would ordinarily attract any provisions of the law in regard to remissions of sentence in India, if the prisoner were removed there. So far as I know, these are to he found in s.401 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and may also include the jail regulations whereby a prisoner can earn remission for good conduct while 'undergoing sentence. I think the Government of India might object to their hands being tied by the undertaking that has been given to the Tangier Administration. H.G.
