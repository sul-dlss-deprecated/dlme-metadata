The hearer Salman hin Rashdan is a Kuwait subject who owns a hum called w Samhan' No.261, in partnership with his brother Salim hin Rashdan who is a Kuwait subject also. The hum left for Zanzibar, under the command of a foreign master from Kung (Persia), where she was loaded with rafters. Salman and Salim have recently fallen out and Salim wen went to Lingah and upon th^ arrival of the hum there, he took possession of her, disposed of some of the rafters without the concurrence of his elder brother Salman, and sailed with the hum oroceeding to Bahrain. His brother is afraid that he may get the balance of tne goods and money into his power,and as they are indebted to me for the value of dates and the account is current between me and Salman, the latter has asked me to let him go to Bahrain to protect his bum and the cargo. I, therefore, request you to give him a letter to the Political Agent asking for his good offices in case his brother might object him, if his brother objects he can come with him here and I shall deal with their case in accordance with, justice.

A. for his help as per your kind promise to my father to do so. My father is a Nejd subject domicilled in Iran and is a merchant in Dubai, he has a partner there named Sulaiman bin Saleh ' Al-Fawaz, who is also a Nejd subject. They have a claim of Rs.800/- ( Rs. 505/- cost of a draft and Rs. 295/- cash loan) against Ahmed bin Khalsf bin Ataibah of Bu Dabhi Reading notable of Bu Dabi. This claim was cost of draft drawn against him who accepted ^na further asked for a loan from^father ! s partner which was also paid to him, he promised payment when he sells his pegyls. My father’s partner has a 'sennad*’ from the above idimed in of the amount which^now 1 in my father f s possession, it is in favour of my father’s partner, but my father also possess another document proving his partnership with his above partner Sulaiman which was duly endorsed by Shaibkh Said bin Maktoom, Ruler of Aubai. fU Then above dbtor iihmed bin Ataibah sold his pearls this year and came to Dubai, they asked A for payment of the above claim which he refused, the Ruler of Dubai is not so active as to force such rich people to pay claims of foreigners as my father and his partner. Th®^-° 0 ■ re my father went to Isa bin Abdul Lattif,]Di the British Agent, at Shargah, who gave him two sealed letters one addressed to above debtor Ahmed bin i^aibah and the other to his father Khalaf bin Ataibah, but as both Ahmed and his father Khalsf has in the meantime left Bu Dabhi for Linga^, my father was not in a position to go and hand them the letters there, the above two letters, are now with my father. Now the debtor and his father returend to Bu Dabhi, but my father has decided to come to Bahrain and ask for P- A's help in this connection. My father wishes that a letter may kindly be written by the P.A. to the Ruler of Bu Dabhi, Shaikh Shakhboot bin Sultan bin Zayied and to the above Ahmed bin Khalaf- 2 . /“N Khalnf bin ^taibah reauesting them payment of his claim, further my father when going to Bu Dabhi will give first Tsa f s letters to the debtor and father and if they proved to be ineffective, he will then hand P.A f s letters to the debtor and the Ruler of Bu Dabhi. Further, as my father wishes to close his business in Dubai and finally come to Bahrain, he hubnly wishes that i . A. him may kindly write/two letters one to Isa bin Abdul Lattif, British Agent, at Shargeh and the other to Shaikh Said bin Maktoom, Ruler of Dubai, asking them to help him in recovering his claims against the people there, because after the recovery of his claims, he will dissolve hg^ partnership with his above partner and will come to Bahrain, for troubling you with these strictly private affairs, but any how we are always in need of your help and advice. I shall be much obliged if you will kindly excuse me Hubmly submitted for favour of consideration.

Is there any reason, however, ^hy the Bahrein Government should not fight the battles of it^ j n subjects and approach the Muscat State direct? If I nad surplus time on my hand I w ould be quite billing to continue taking up such cases, but my primary duty here is to look after the interests of British not foreign suujecos, and ii I dissipate my time, energy and influence -ith the Muscat State in taking up cases for the latter the former must inevitably suffer. There are here a number of unsettled cases of British subjects versus Muscatis, and I feel that I should concentrate to try and get these settled before dealing T,T ith outside interests. 2. Unless therefore you have very strong reason for asking my good offices on behalf of Bahreinis, I hope .yon -ill send no further such cases to me. *&gt;/ cTU/to 0 e c.

Most of the raised cases relate to starting up debt recovery proceedings for sums of money as little as 4 rupees and as much as 7,000 rupees, in 1928 to 1931. The claimants are merchants, sailors and others living in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar or Trucial Coast.
