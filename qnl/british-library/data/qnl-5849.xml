Copy of the undernoted publication is forwarded to The Political A&amp;ent, Muscat, The Political Agent, Bahrain, The Political Agent, Kuwait, Sir Gilbert Clayton’s Report on his Mission to the King of the Hejaz.SECRET. D.O. No. 4-4-7 Wv dear I write to tell you of an interesting story which I have recently heard. It incidentally throws light on Bin sauds method of keeping certain of the principal men in places opposed to him, in his pay. I have been assured of the authenticity of the story by at least one reliable person, lin strictest confidence of course ). (2) It appears that early in June last Bin S&amp;ud senu his confidential servant Al Rabai via Riath down to Kuwait with confidential letters as well as X?OQ/ in gold coin. The man travelled to the coast with Sheikh Ahmed*s messen^r one Ibn Malyus. When near to the Kuwait frontier both were siezed by the Ajman rebels and imprisoned, though not before ibn Rabai had managed to hand over his saddlebags containing the money and letters to ibn M^lyua with the request that if he got away, he should keep the contents in trust and hand them over to no man but the Aialr s&amp;ud at Riath. (3) , ibn Malyus, the rebels released as soon as they knew he was the sheikh of Kuwait's messenger but Al Rabai they cast into irons. (4) , in due course ibn Malyus reached Kuwait, delivered his own letters and reported the condition of Al pabai. (3). In the meantime K.B. Mullah saleh the sheikhs Wazir by means best known to himself got to know that ibn Malyus was in possession of the saddlebags contains ing Al Rabai's secret matter, so sending for him he demanded that the contents be handed over. Ibn Malyus to save himself handed over the letters, but vut v The Agency. KUWAIT. Persian Gulf. 27/7/29.(2) but said nothing of the raoney which he looked upon as a ”trust” on behalf of Al Rabai. (6) . The same nigh$ he ibn M&amp;lyus fled, to the camp, told Al Ribal what he had done and continued his journey to Riath. whilst there he was joined by Al Ribai who had been released by the personal intervention of Sheikh Ahmed in the meanwhile. (7) . a month later ibn Malyus appeared once more in Kuwait bearing a letter from Amir saoud explaining what purported to be the reason why he ibn Malyus had run away to Riath, and bearing another letter to Al Nafisi instructing the latter to take over the &amp;0Q/- in gold from ibn Malyus. (6). The point now is for whom w^s the £?0Q/* in gold, and to whom were the confidential letters addressed. These latter are now in the hands of Mullah galih, and he has a most powerful weapon for blackmail. That he will also use it is certain, unless,( and this is not at all an unlikely contingency ) he himself is in the pay of Bin r&amp;ud, and one of the letters was for him as was also part of the £?G0/~ . ($). i am assured that Rheikh Ahmed knows nothing of the story, and still less suspects any of his officials of being in the pay of Bin Raud. I on the contrary am morally certain that Rheikh Ahmed is surrounded by rogues and traitors, both amongst his relatives and among his chief officials, j do not include the sons of Mohomed and Jarrah, brothers of Rheikh Mubarak whom the latter murdered, and who reside today at fut «s zain and zubair. I cannot blame these latter if they intrigue. (ie)~ The curious part of the business is the sending of the £?CQ/- in gold. As everyone knows pin Raud frequently sends Nafisi large sums of money to buy supplies, tents etc. etc., but this is always done by(3) by 'hawala' # In the present case the names mentioned by my Informant as the persons for whom the money was intended were, (a). k.B. Mullah S&amp;leh. (outwardly very anti B.S, (h). K*B. Ahciul Latif. (warmly pro B.S, ). (11). If there Is any truth in the above story and some of bheikh Ahmed's entourage and officials have a foot in the other camp for personal ends in case Bin Baud ever should &amp;et hold of Kuwait ) then Sheikh Ahmads case is indeed a difficult one, for every one of his secrets will assuredly be conveyed to the other side. On the other hand if Bheikh Ahmad is aware of his officials duplicity, then all is well. It shows he is keeping himself under restraint, and watching events quietly. I send the above story for what It is worth, you have more knowledge of Kuwait than I have , and you may think it a ' canard '. I sincerely hope it is. All well here. Yours sincerely,Telegram (E.Q.)

On enquiry from ? your office, I am informed that no action has been taken in the matter. I aim greatly surprised and astonished to hear this, especially as it was with the greatest difficulty that I was able to assist your father in the matter and get the Air authorities to agree to a loan of petrol and oil being made, at the time. FurMier it was only after your father had given me the most solemn promise to immediately replace the petrol and oil taken by yias an equal amount from A1 Khadairi in Basrah, that the R.A.F. agreed to/loan of G-overnment oil. Failure to carry .out the promises^ made to me by Abdullah al-Nafisi^ your father^ naturally puts me- in a most awkward position, and blackens my face in the eyes of the Air Officer Commanding, Baghdad. ‘ I would request you on receipt of this letter to order by telegram the amount of petrol and oil needed to pay back the loan and I shall ask you to be ggod enough to inform me that you,have done this, so that I can send a satisfactory reply to Baghdad.

Sir, I am directed by Lord Passfield to refer to the letter from this Department No. 79008/30, of the 24th July enclosing a copy of a despatch from the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq regarding the future status of Koweit and the relations of that territory with Nejd and Iraq. 2. In his despatch Major Young suggested that Hie Majesty # s Government, while making no overt act to encourage the absorption of Koweit by Iraq, should in fact assist any tendency there may be in that direction by assimilating their treaty relations with Koweit to the relations with CL Iraq under the new Treaty as soon as it has been ratified. The adoption of Major Young's suggestion/ould clearly involve a reversal of the policy as regards Koweit followed by his Majesty’s Governments in this country for many years. As recently as the 18th March 1929 the Cabinet Sub-Committee jof Imperial Defence appointed to consider the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf came to the following conclusion t- 'As regards Koweit it is better on the whole that matters should remain as they are and that, while endeavour ing to secure so far as possible that Koweit shall not be identified with Iraq, we should defer consideration of the establishment of a formal Protectorate until circumstances appear to make this more clearly desirable*'. Lord Passfield is not aware of any new circumstances which make it desirable that there should now be a change of policy as regards Koweit in particular or Persian Gulf matters in general. 3. In Lord Passfield’s view, the closer union of Koweit withWith Iraq can scarcely strengthen the position of His Majesty’s Government in the latter country, and would undoubtedly weaken their position with Koweit. At present His Majesty’s Government can, with the minimum of effort, secure that all matters of importance the Sheikh of Koweit shall follow their advice and, so long as they support the Sheikh and guarantee his independence, this fortunate situation may be expected to continue. But with the merging of Iraq and Koweit into one State,it might be much less Koweit, the authorities of which would then look to Baghdad rather than to His Majesty’s Government for guidance. Moreover, any union of Koweit with Iraq would inevitably produce some sort of reaction in the other Arab protected States, the rulers of which, receiving the impression that the interests of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf were on the decline, might think it well to seek for themselves the overlordship of, if not absorption by, Ibn Saud or any other Arab who might then be powerful in the interior of Arabia. that His Majesty’s Government should continue the policy hitherto followed, namely, to maintain Koweit as a Protected State entirely independent of either Iraq or Hejd, but he would be glad to be furnished with an expression of Mr. Henderson’s views on the matter.

We are very grateful for your friendliness and carefulness in the matters that concern us. Further we would like to thank you for your nice present, the book which deals with the horses sent us by you, and to have your continued satisfactory news always. Usual ending.Translation of a letter TO- From - Hafith Wahba, London. To - Lt.Col. H.R.P.Dickson, Kuwait. Dated 10th February 1931. To my dear Colonel Dickson: I present to you my compliments and thoughts, and wish you, Ivlrs.Dickson and the small children all health and happiness. I wr&amp;te to you in Arabic because it is easy to write this. Winter is nearly finished here, and I thank God that we had nothing to complain of from the severity of cold weather. We only were annoyed by the fog which came near to suffocating us. Truly winter here is ve y nice, but very annoying when rain falls. I like England ve y much, as well as the English people, although outwardly they would appear to be somewhat rough in their manners and do not like to be acquainted with the strangers. This appears most to those who did not mix with them. But I like their ways and general characteristics much. They are great in everything, and I believe that these very characteristics of jtimm theirs are stronger for C0od, than the Navy of which they boast. The more I mix with the people the more I admire them. 2. On the 23rd April I shall deliver a lecture about Arabia in the Royal Asiatic Society, in which X shall include the dis positions (or location) of Arabs in general, and some of the Arab customs ignored by many who know nothing about the Arabs. 3. On the 20th February we shall hold a Reception at Hyde f Park Hotel to commemorate the Coronation-day of King Abdul Aziz in the Hijaz. We postponed this party from the 8th January on account of the death of H.M.the King’s sister. There have been many efforts to remove the misunderstanding that has existed between King ibn Saud and the Hon’ble the Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf, and both Sir Andrew/ and I have succeeded in removing same. P© also tried to arrange that ^- 2 - that the Hon*hie the Political Resident should meet with the Kins 1* last month, but the short time stay of the Kin| in Nejd prevented this* 5. V/e both hope that an opportunity will occur for the Hon’ble the Polioical Resident’s to visit Hijaz, so that all difficulties may be removed from hearts. He may be able to settle all questions connected with the Gulf, especially those of Kuwait, which grow more complicated as time passes. 6. I am very delighted because of the permission given by H?M f the King to some tribes and people of Nejd to travel to Ku?iait for 'Mus&amp;balah”, and because of the progress of the 'Baladiyah” in Kuwait, and the satisfaction that it is giving to the people. Colonel Dickson’s name will always be remembered as long as 'Baladiyahs' are mentioned in the Persian Gulf.HI 7. As to the use of 'Abas' which Shaikh Ahmad has ordered to be given up, this has certainly economic advantages, but it is the minds that have to be changed and not the dress. The Shaikh ■ may possibly on his own do so, but you must certainly advise him to pay attention to education v/hich acts as shining light over every country. Shaikh Ahmad is man of great heart, and can easily be convinced. I love Kuwait and its people from the bottom of my heart and wish it every success. ‘ Therefore, the best that I should like to wish for her and to hear, is that you are advising the Shaikh to progress and civilize Kuwait, which indeed will make everyone remember you for all time. Last month London v/as full of those who attended the j ^ndian Round Table Conference, but now after the delegations have left for home, the movement is transferred to India. I ask God |J the Almighty to graciously confer upon this worl4a state of quietness and taanqility. Abdur Rahman al-usaibi presents his many salams to you and mentions you honourably. Usual ending.PEIiSQN/iL &amp; C0KF1 DEI^TIaL * Political Agency % Kuwait. Dated the 23r&amp; April 1921. I have to apologize very greatly indeed for not laving replied earlier to your charming and inter esting letter of 10th Februaiy last which reached me early in Larch and which gave me great pleasure. 2* I had intended writing to you a month ago, hut three tilings came in the way, which successfully pre vented me. Firstly, I went into camp at Araifjan for 10 days with Mrs* Dickson and the children, secondly, I had to write up my Annual Administration Report on Kuwait which ran into 52 pages of foolscap, and thirdly, I had to complete and get off the Annual Kuwait Trade Report, which with its tremendous amount of detail and figures, kept me busy for the best part of a month. I hope therefore you will accept the above reasons as ray excuse for failing to wiite. 3* I am greatly looking forward to reading your lecture on Arabia before the Royal Asiatic Society. As I am also a member, I shall no doubt see it in the next nournal. It is not surprising that people in England are ignorant of the manners and customs of Arabs, and a lecture on this subject from one speaking with authority will do nothing but good. 4* I was keenly interested to hear about the reception which you gave at the Hyde Park Hotel in honour of H.M.King Bin Saud*s coronation day. Indeed I heard about it from several other sources also, and was told it was a great success. 5* I fully share your hopes about Colonel Biscoe being able to visit the Fejaz before long to clear up all misunderstandings for I am a great believer in the saying that 'More is accomplished in an hour’s conversation, than in a year of letter writing'. Of course I shall makeevery effot to accompany ky chief, who not only is an extraordinarily charming and capable officer to work under, but is equally anxious with myself to bring about a lasting rapprochment between the Kingdom of Nejd and Kuwait, After all this should not be a difficult matter seeing that both Bulers are of the same noble 'Anlze' stock, and must feel drawn together by many and intimate bonds of sentiment and friendship, I know Kuwait is ever proud of the fact that it was able to shelter and assist His Majesty Abdul Aziz and his revered father Abdul Bahman in the days of adversity, and I equally well know that His Majesty in his innermost heart looks upon Kuwait as his home and has a deep affection for the house of the el-Subah in spite of all temporary mis- under at an &lt;11 ng s • I am glad to say that there are more and more indications that relations between Hie two countries are growing better* This of course is a source of supreme satisfaction to me* What is working the change exactly I do not know, but it is clear that a much better understanding exists all round as witness the King's very cordial invi tation to Shaikh Ahmad to proceed to Mecca and the still more friendly request of Amir Saud to be allowed to accompany him, which were received lately. Also the settlement at' the case of the 52 Nejd cp me Is found with the Araibdar by the Custom of 'ARAFA', under which the King paid over the value of the camels and received the camels in exchange• 7. Frontier relations also continue to be good, and there has been no sort of incident worth mention ing since the surrender cf the Rebels and their leaders last year. Bain has been plentiful all over South Nejd, Hassa, and Kuwait, and especially good over the Sumaan area and. the Kuwait Neutral Zone, where grazing is now magnificent. This has naturally attracted the Muntafik and ’Iraq Shawiyeh, who are now scattered all over thedwryih*i country to the South and South-West of Kuwait, while the ’Iraq camel tribes such as the Dhafir, Jashan\and Saadun are all in the 'Surarian' fraternizing with the Mutair and Harb. The ’Iraq southern desert on the other hand has had bad rains, but except for the Sam&amp;wa tribes, the shepherds hove not really suffered as they simply moved to where the rains and grazing was good i*e* in Kuwait, Jumman and Hassa* 10. We had further good rain on £3nd April over a wide area, which has further helped matter* H. Shaikh Ahmad and all the members of the oubah family are well. The former went into camp at Haweli for a fortnight while the latter nearly all are camped at Araifjan together with Hilal al Mutairi* .Shimlan and other leading Arabs are camped on the Qusur road at different points. 12. We have had many n fuga 8t this year to eat but brought in from a distance. How I must really close this long letter.

Political A.;ejac/, BahraiHitiie 1st November 1931 • From:- The Political Agent, Bahrein. To:- The Jioa f ble the Political Resident in the ersiaa Gulf, Bushire. Sir, i here the honour to give some details regarding the visit of His Highness rince Ahmad Tauhid and Jamal 'asha to Bahrain- The former who is a grandson of H.I.M the late ^ultan .haul Aziz of Turkey appears to be of no importance. Ee has little money and is out of sympathy wita Arabs,though full of praise for Bin Ra f ud who apparently received him well during the last Haj* 2. Jamal Pasha however is e very intelligent man and speaks English well and French fluently. He is in Bin Sa f ud T s service having formerly been Par minister. He informed me that he had been on a mission to discover the cause of the great drop in the number of pilgrims to the lieujaz. He found this to be largely the result of bad trade but also the result I of a certain amount of en^nity shown to Bin g&amp;’ud. ^oter ae somewhat unnecessarily showed me a letter from His Majesty authorizing him to thank a prominent Bombay merchant for his help to Islam and asked me to draft a cjngratulatory telegram to him. The 'asha has travelled extensively in India recently and also had visas for the Butch East Indies which he had not used. 3. He then asked me if he might speak confidentially to me. He told me that his real object was to sound Moslem opinion in India and yria witn regard to a Moslem Conference |5V. 2 . that Sia Ce’ud nad ii view f tue object being to unite the islrmic fold aau assist tu© pilgri age. He tola me tnat Hr S&amp;'ud full/ sympathized with our difficulties in iMdia and tiiat he wisiied to rally Moslems to our siae. Hid I think he could usefully intervene in this Blatter? Could i give dim a letter of any kind which could use in tais co^ectioa? 1 replied that I was far from India and out of touch with fiJjt Moslem opinion and/ne no aoubt would have had better opportun ities of forming an opinion from contact with both officials and nslems/. He i . euiately dropped this line end aid not return to it. 4. He told me that on arrival in f Iraq ana more especially in Syria he would give out this suggestion of a Conference to the press and that after reporting to Bin Sa T ud he would return to India with a view to encouraging tne Haj. I personally consider tae Congress as a blind but report the facts in view of the rumour prevalent in the f iraq papers tiiat a Congress is to be called in 'alestine under liaahiraite influence with a view to reinstating the ex-Cultan of Turkey as Khalifa. The rumour states that the Shaikhs on the Tersian Gulf Littoral have been ap roached ana tnMr there has been no sign of any s ich invitation having b en received here,it is just possible that the n asha may be preparing a counterblast I have n©4; seen sign of it. His real errand in my opinion is to discover the cause of the very serious crop in pilgrims and to find means of combating it. 5. He was emphatic that a collision between Imam fahyia and Bin Sa f ud was only a question of time since Bin a f ud could not tolerate any foreign penetration of Arabia and since it was well known that the Bols^hevists had gained, a very strong hold in the Yemen, lie mentioned tiiat while he was ar Minister he had been asked to make out a plan for the subjwjatioi! of the 'emen and to estimate its cost ana it was found that it could not be done for less than a million sterling*, u&amp;tu bq Bin\ 3. Bin aud was reluctantly obli ea to postpone it end tnat at the present moment such a conilict was not within the realms of practical politics. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Tolitical ^gent,Kuwait,who may glean further information during the stay of the party in Kuwait. I have the honour to be Sir, Tour lost Obedient Servant, Political Agent, Bahrain. i Xu Qujtx'uiCONFIDENTIAL . D.0.N0.44* Political Ageiioy t Kuwait# Dated tlx© 1st April 1932* You will remenber that I sent you a tolegraia No.36 dated the 16tb March in reply to your D.O.C.SO dated the 10th Mar oh saying I would get out &lt;£ the Shaikh as soon as he returned from Riath the formal jfcetfcer you require about the 3 Kuwait 'ocKiaissloners' to meat Bin Baud’s 'CamixdssitXiOrs' and discuss possible ways and moans for a removal of the Blockade. 2 . During the Bhaikh’s absence, (to be exact on 22nd March 1932) I took the opportunity of sending for and discussing the whole question of the blockade with the Bhaikh’s Confidential Secretary or 'Wazir* Khan Bahadur Mulla Salih, a shrewd mn, who in his time served Shaiklis Mubarak, Jabir and Salim. In parti cular I asked him how in his opinion he ihou^Jit the matter mi$it be settled, and what terms he thoi^t the Shailih would agree to being offered by his ecsmissloners, always assuming that Bin Baud would also agree to them. 3. Mulla Salih*s reply, and lie took pains to adx; that it was his own opinion only , and was not to be taken in any way as reflecting the Shaikh’s views, was to the ©f ect that the Shaikh should propose the appointment of a special Kuwaiti Officer to collect Nejd customs on goods taken out cf Hi city by bona- fide Nejd merchants, Nejd tribesmen,and on goods exported to Nejd by Kuwait merchants.

The point of keeping the whole thing a strictly private and personal ar angoment, added Mull© Salih, was the Shaikh’s fear lest the Arab world, think that Kuwait was paying tribute or 'Jezsata' Tax to Bin Baud* Xf once such an idea got abroad, then all would be spoilt* w Pride n said Mull a Salih, was everything in the world to an Arab, and especially to an ancient ruling house such as the w As~Subah w was* The Shaikh would rather die or see his city ruined , than have his*honour n sullied in any way, as in the eyes of Arabs it would be if it was even* thou^it he was paying 'Jezzia' Tax to Bin Baud* 6* When I asked how Bin Baud could insure, that he was , getting the ^hol© customs receipts taken, Mulla 3alih replied - 'That is the whole point, the bus!nosr must be rim on ' mutual tru &amp;t r • lines* Both Rulers were hi^i spirited and honourable Arabs, and if XbhSilbah gave his word to Ibn Saud that he would day straight, j then the other must and would accept his fellow Ruler’s piloted word* Arab honour would not require more”* 7. Mulla Salih finally said that it of course would be open to both or either party to conclude the arrangement any time they thought fit, for instance Kuwait could not be expected to | .continue the arrangement, if Ibn Saud was involved in hostilities with His Majesty’s Government, or if he started blockade restrict** | ions again etc* etc* jm3m 'ly 6m Ifulla Sallh^s views open up fresh possibilities and I write the above rathe ^ at length to shm yon how the Arab mind worlcs and how that the bi^reot difi'ioulty wo are up A- against in this business is 'Arab Pride* # Ibn Sand has a sufficiency of this we know,but Ibn Subah, I suppose because he is the little fellow, and so more sensitive has a 'double / amount'• This 'pride' business is a wonderful thing, as instance tf \e murder recently in Baghdad of the Mutasar: if by Abdullah Beg al ia.leh as^Baadun, and I fear we have got to take it into our calculations* lTelegram (C) 0 From - Political, Kuwait.

It was to such cases that Bin Saud clearly referred, added the Shaikh, and which he also understood were meant when he agreed to the Remadhan 1951 idea. 9, Personally when the Shaikh told me that he had agreed to Bin Saud s proposal and without having previously talked the matter over with me, I must confess I thought nothing of the mat er, and looked on the proposal in the same light as the Shaikh did, for I also am painfully familiar with the Bedouin and his interminable 'camel' claims. They make one*giddy* as the Arab puts it. 10, Bln Saud I do not suppose yet knows anything of the claims we sent in, to His Majesty’s Government, in respect of the Akhwan damage, $8 I much doubt if there is anything of a'cunning' move behind his present proposal, nevertheless it is always as well to be forwarned, and I think your letter made the Shaikh jtidbsk think as it did me. 11# In the meantime we have got the Shaikh s ideas on ft the subject, and we can always turn these up, should Bin Saud turn 'nasty', I do not think it would be wise to do anything more at present.J * Hob Politioai ®wwdt* Da tea. the 14th April 1932 • Frm lieuteae*ja t-*Colo»el H*B # &gt;'*Dlekaaii f Politioal agent, Te The Bonnie ^be Follt leal Eesldent In the Persian Gulf, Bush ire* Rmralt.

D*O.No.212-S of 1932 British 'Residency, Bushire, the 6th April 1932. 4)L J'^Ul U^jil correspondence where there is any real urgency aoout tne matter it seems to me that it was perhaps hardly necessary in these days of economy to transmit the information contained in your telegram i^o.45 of 5th April, regarding the Shaikh’s yisit to Ibn 3aud, by telegram and that it could have awaited the ordinary post which will reach me in three or four days’ time. I shall doubtless receive a more detailed report in due course, and I am glad that the visit was successful, but if you avoid all contentious subjects it is not difficult to be friendly. Y/hen all is said and done Ibn Saud’s actions hardly correspond with his words and I have not the least doubt that he is ready to give the Shaikh as many honeyed words as he wants, provided all contentious subjects are avoided, and he can maintain his strangle-hold on the State. With the best will in the world Shaikh Ahmad is really a little difficult to help. He complains bitterly of the blockade, but will not stir a little finger himself to get it ended, and simply folds his arms and expects us to pull the chesnuts out of the fire for him. Again he has let us down very badly over the Kuwait oil, and I believe His Majesty’s Government propose to leave it to him to insist on the nationality clause or not as he likes, an!

No.53 Confidential. &amp; jU The Agency, Kuwait. 14.4.32 I have just received your D.O. No.212 S. D/ 6th April It took 9 days to reach me. 2. I am sorry about the telegram you refer to,and I shall try and see that it does not occur again. 3. About the Sheikhs visit to Riath, and your remarks thereon. I am afraid the Sheikh from the first never intended to discuss Blockade matters with Bin Saud, and if you remember when I went to Hoffuf with you I was asked by him to deliver a message to that effect. The Sheikh I admit is being very difficult in this matter and it is not easy to make excuses for him. 4. As far as I can make out the Sheikh is in process of trimming his sails, and is definitely anxious today to let matters lie where the Blockade is concerned if he is to be called upon to move in the matter. His people are of course anxious for relief but their Ruler appears to have developed a peculiar keenness not to offend Bin Saud Just now. He passed a curious remark to me recently when I was talking to him preparatory to getting the letter out of him that you wanted. It was as follows; rt If H.M.G f s only object Is to try and get me to try and effect a settlement direct with Bin Saud then I say let things be, as they are, I am content to wait till Bln Saud dies - Then I shall get all I want*. He said this in a tone of appeal as if he feared something. It Is true that Bin Saud has several times hinted of late that relations would be much better if Sheikh Ahmad would submit his troubles direct and not drag in H.M.Q*. to his support. The Honble. Lt. Colonel H.V.Blscoe Political Resident In the Persian Gulf.2 . 5. A curious thing also happened immediately after uhe Sheikhs return on 3rd April. A1 Nafiei called on me on the 5th,(he is Bin Sauds agent as you know) He urged me solemnly and with obvious sincerity and anxiety in his voice, to use all my endeavours with to end the Blockade quickly, for Kuwait was in a very baa way indeed just now. He Instanced the fact that the Sheikh had since hia return called on the merchants for a ^10000/- subscript- inn to feed the poor, and that the amount collected had reached ifeQOOO/- in two days: Nafisi ended his talk by saying that he had received a personal letter from Bin Saud by the hand of his son who had accompanied the Sheikhs party, to the effect that he Bin Saud sent his special rt salaams** to me, and was much pleased with all my efforts to bring about a better understanding between Kuwait and Nejd. 6. I have a sort of feeling that the Sheikhs curious desire to keep in with Bln Saud these days is possibly due to the Anti British propaganda which has for sometime past been going on in Kuwait: I ha mentioned the matter to you before. It takes the form that Great Britain is loosing her grip of things in the Hear Bast and Bast general -ly, as Instance th© condition of India, her relaxing her hold in Iraq, and her policy in Persia etc. etc. Great Britain is pictured as being all too ready nowadays to adopt the line of least resistance, abandon her rights, desert her friends, and generally rely on the League of Nations (a broken reed) to ajust her affairs for her. Nearer home, the Sheikh has seen unaccountable delays as he thinks, in the matter of his Date Gardens, the settle ment of the Blockade, and the Post and Telegraph question. All this In a way confirms he thinks what propagandists are ever preaching. He of course fears : ejd and Iraq, the latter much more than the former. What better course he thinks than to be in the fashion and arrange a rapprochmant with one of his strong neighbours Bln Saud, a big personage certainly and to whom he after all is related, by tribal ties3 unufi ■ &lt; 'worn. : «3o| ion i y m fiI5CC, t'/ far r.^ M IftC I vU Though I have of course nothing definite to go on as yet, X have a sort of feeling that the Sheikha visit t&lt;k Riath was with a view to arrange some sort of secret alliance, or at any rate to prepare the way for one, Theeahove is of course surmise, hut I believe there is something in it. 3 # As regards your remarks about the Sheikh and the 'Oir* business. Your telegram No. 93 of 6th Febuary last to the Govt, of India and I*ondon, I thought was extraordinarily well put and included everything I could possibly have thought of. Hence I offered no comments, though you were good enough to invite me to do so in your D.0.43-S. of 6th Feb. While I confess I was very disappointed at the Govt, of Indias reply (No.623 D/£23rd Feb.) and rather forsee as you do that H.M.G. will probably decide to leave it to the Sheikh to insist on the Nationality Clause*’ or not as he likes, I nevertheless feel quite hopeful that the Sheikh will not let us down: certainly this is the impression I have formed from sundry talks X have had with him lately. The one thing I am afraid of is that the Sheikh will read in such a course another instance of weakness and surrender on our part, and it will give further support to the statements of anti British propagandists that we are rt on the run*. The Sheikh X feel quite sure would like and respect us in proportion if H.M.G. stuck to their point and themselves insisted on the Nationality Clause, against the whole world. It is human nature after all for everyone not excepting Arabs to like to see their friends put up a vigorous and strong front to all comers. Holmes of course is continuing his blandishments from Bahrain, and writes almost weekly personal letters to the Sheikh. Last week he sent him a second sample of so called '’oil 11 extracted from his well at Bahrain, and expressed the hope that the Sheikh would soon allow him to pull up a similar sample in Kuwait.He of course Is a renegade*,’ and one of tthe worst anti British propagandists In the Oulf I consider. He more than anyone else stands for and advises the Sheikh to kick against our control and strike out a line for himself. 10. I saw ^ox of the A.P.O.G. last night, he tells m© he has received a wire from Abadan to suspend surface boring operations. I see Holmes* and his friend Mellons hand in this. 11. X have written a very gossipy letter I fear, but I like you to know things I cannot put down in official letters, it helps you to get local atmosphere I think. 12.

I agree very much with your views about the Shaikh, and in some ways I sympathise with him. I think His Majesty’s Government have been extraordinarily remiss in trying to implement their promise to him and tney are trying to shilly-shally over the date gardens. I have written a I).C. to Parkinson of the Colonial Office more or less giving the gist of wnat you say, and expressing the view that it is definitely up to us to do something about the blockade. I have suggested that we should press strongly for the commissioners, not so much because I am very hopeful about any result, but because it will show I bn Baud that His Majesty's Government regard the blicka.de as an unfriendly act, and are definitely interesting themselves in tne matter. Further, if nothing comes of it, I think we in a very strong position to press Ibn Saud to agree to the manifest system which is really the only proper solution of the matter. Anyhow, I propose to press the matter if i go home tnis summer. One point more. You mention that the Shaikh said that if His Majesty’s Government’s only object was to get him to try and effect a settlement direct with ion Saud then he was content to let matters rest where they were. It is not my view that he should try and effect a settlement direct with Ibn Saud, My view was, however, that he might have at least mentioned the matter to Ibn Saud, or at any rate have expatiated meaningly on the losses his merchants iel H.A.f .Dickson ,C.

I admit he cannot say tha.t to you or to me, but after all he has two strings to his bow and can say one thing to us and another to Ryan or get Fuad Hamza to do so. However, we will discuss these matters when we meet as x. hope v/e shall do some t ime in the near future. v!Confidential D.0.110.255-5 of 1932 Brit ish Residency Bushire, the 26th April 1932 Just a line to let you know that the report that His Majesty's Government have lent Ibn Saud £ 500,000 is quite incorrect.

Subject to the concurrence of the Sec- il fli: 'll’ -retary of State for India and the Secretary for foreign Affairs, Sir Phillip Cunliffe-Lister would suggest that the. guestion should now be taken up with the Hejaz-Nejd Government through His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda in the following manner. King Ibn Saud should be informed that His Majesty's Government have received a report from the Political Resident in the Perdian Gulf upon his recent visit to the King at which the guestion of the Kuwait blockade was one of the guestions discussed. King Ibn Saud will recollect that at first he expressed the opinion that there were three ways in which the matter could be settled, viz:* (l) ne should be allowed to establish a post at some place on the outskirts of Kuwait territory where he would take e Under Secretary of State, India Office.2 . take his customs, Kuwait to guarantee that all goods should pass through this place. (2) A Nejd customs post in the hands of a Nejdi official should he established at the gate of Kuwait town to collect the Nejd dues as caravans passed out. (3) Kuwait should make a fixed annual payment representing the Neja share of the Kuwait customs. Sheikh Yusaf Yasin subsequently stated that the King realised that the first two suggestions were impracticable, and the Sheikh of Kuwait, who has been consulted, has stated M that he cannot see his way to accept the third. King Ihn Saud, however, himself intimated to Colonel Biscoe as a result of their discussion that the only solution he could see was for 'arbitrators rt from either side, consisting of well known merchants and possibly one official, to meet and try to work out a compromise which would be acceptable to both parties. The Sheikh of Kuwait accepts this proposal and His Majesty’s Government trust that in the interests QG co-operation and friendly relations be- -tween the Kejaz-Nejd and Kuwait, King Ibn Saud will now agree to the appointment of such a Gommission. if so, they will be glad to know whom the King would propose to appoint as his representatives . The Sheikh of Kuwait for his part would be agreeable to appoint as the Kuwaiti representatives two merchants and one official! preferably i a customs official). i 3. If sue&amp; a commission is appointed, Bir Bhiilip Gunliffe-Lister would propose to inform Colonel Biscoe that His Majesty’s Government see no objection to the Kuwait representatives putting forward a proposal on the lines suggested in paragraph 11 of the Political Resident’s,. ^ W..,-'. • . despatch n i m t | i i 1 I Idespatch No 3 of the 5th of February. Colonel -^iscoe nu^nriMnrfawyir’ir does not enter into any details of the scheme which he proposes, hut, reading the Resident’s proposal in the light of the observations made in his telegram of the 13th of March and connected correspondence, Sir Thillip Cunliffe-Lister envisages a scheme somewhat on the following lines, ihe Kuwait customs would he increased by an agreed percentage and an agreed pro- -portion of these receipts would be paid over to the Ring. The King would at the same time establish front- -ier posts at the wells where he would arrange to col- -lect his own customs dues on the entry of goods into Nejd, and the Sheikh of Kuwait would institute a system of manifests which would enable a check to be kept upon the goods passing through the posts. The King would thus have two separate sources of revenue, firstly a percentage of Kuwait oust..ms and secondly the money derived from his own customs, The scheme would appear to have several advantages. First t he King has said that he cannot afford to establish and maintain customs posts on the frontier as he has no money, If he were to receive a percentage of the Kuwait customs in addition to his own customs dues, the money thus provided would be available for this purpose, and the financial objec- Ttion would be met, Secondly there would be definite inducement to the King to encourage trace through Kuwait, as his receipts both from the Kuwait customs and from his own customs would increase in proportion to the in- -crease of trade. Thirdly, a system of this sort v/hould benefit Kuwait customs inasmuch the Kuwait customs re- A -ceipts would increase as a result of the greater volume of trade. It may be objected that the payment of a per- -centage of the Kuwait customs would, in effect be a payment for the purpose of buying off the blockade.tic/ 4. ■blockade. -^evei t&gt;liel6®s j it would not} Id© a fixsd annual payment, wblch. would have the appearance of “trihute 1 *, and to which the Sheikh would he strongly opposed, hut wouId^vary from year to year according to the volume of trade, and it should he possible, therefore, for the Sheikh to accept the arrangement without loss of prestige. 4. Sir Phillip Cunliffe-Lister would also suggest that Sis Maj et@y f s Minister at Jedda should he instructed to advise the Hejaz-Nejd Government at a suitable oppor- -tuhity informally of the existence of the claim put for- -ward by the Sheikh of Kuwait against Ihn Baud. Such a communication might he made on the lines proposed by Colonel Biscoe in the latter part of paragraph 11 of his despatch of the 5th of February. The claims in'ques- -tion are those referred to in paragraph 4 of Colonel*s Biscce # s despatch No 11 of th 15th May, 1931, a copy of which ( with its enclosure) was sent to the India Office and Foreign Office on the 13th of June 1931. 5. Sir Phillip Cunliffe-Lister will he glad to be in- -formed whether Sir Samual Eoare concurs in the procedure now proposed. If so he will suggest to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the question should he taken up as soon as possible with the Hejaz-Nejd Govern- -ment accordingly. 6.

Sir Samuel Eoare concurs generally in the pro- -cedure proposed in paragraphs 2 and 4 of your letter under reply. I am however to offer the following observations on paragraph 3. 3. It is observed that the Political Hesident in the Persian G-ulf did net in his despatches No.3 of the 5th February and No.15 of the 23rd April enter into any details of the proposals to be discussed by the Commission, but that it is contemplated that the Commission should consist mainly of leading merchants and that the discussions should be kep# on a business footing in the hope that the Koweit representatives in view of the commercial interests at stake will leave no stone unturned in their endeavour to arrive at an acceptable solution. In these circumstances Sir Samuel Eoare is inclined th think, subject to Colonel Biscce*s Mews, that it might be preferable to refrain from giving the representatives any lead as to the proposals which they should put forward or as to any arrangement shich they should accept. 4.

As regards paragraph 3 of your letter, the course of action which Sir Philip Cuniilfe-Lister has in mind does not appear to be at variance with the view expressed by Sir Samuel Hoare that it might be preferable to refrain from giving the Kuwaiti representatives any lead as to the proposals which they should put forward, or as to any arrangement which they should accept. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Listor's proposal is merely that the attention of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should be called to the tentative suggestion which he made in paragraph 11 of his despatch No.3 of the 5th of February for an increase of the Kuwait customs dues; that the inter pretation of the scheme as set out in paragraph 3 of this Department's letter of the 18th May should be explained to him, and that he should be informed that His Majesty's Government would see no objection, if 3 he thinks it desirable, to a Solution on these lines being put forward. 3. Subject to Sir Samuel Hoare's concurrence, the Secretary of State proposes to communicate with the Political Resident accordingly, but in doing so he would make it clear that the Resident has dis cretion whether or not to give the Kuwaiti representa-representatives a lead as to the proposals which they should make.

The departure of ibn Rifada from the scenes, is great news. We have had such a lot cf contradictory reports here that one has not known exactly what has happened or what to believe. What a mad person the man was to attempt an invasion of Bin Baud’s dominions with a mere handful of men? Of course someone was behind him. The amusing part is that many Bedouins of the interior in these parts believed that the British were support ing Ibn Rifada. His Bxoelleney Shaikh Ahmad has just been on a vlilt to Baghdad and King Faisal - Purely a private and personal visit. He remained 2 days only in Baghdad. He had never seen Faisal before.

Copies of the late Sir H.Biscoe 1 s despatches Ro,ll of the 13th May and No, 19 of the 18th Kay, to which reference is made in these two Colonial Office letters are understood to have been sent to you direct, 2, I shall be glad if, unless you see serious objection, you will approach the Hejaz-^ejd Government on the lines nrcposed in paragraph 2 of the first enclosure in this despatch. In doing so, you should make it clear that the recommendations of the proposed commission would be ad referendum to King Ibn Saud and to the Sheikh of Koweit, and you should refer to the members of the Commission as 1 delegates * or 1 Commissionex^ and not as ’arbitrators 1 .

Sir, 5 ^ •x- I Imve the honour to refer to correspondence ending with Hie Majesty*s Minister, Jeddah Saving telegraxa Mo. 11 of 25th August 1932 to the Foreign Office, copy of which ^——% | was received here on the 12th instant. 2. The course of events has been as follows. At the end of last January, during sir Hugh Biscoe*s visit to His Majesty Xbn iiaud, the latter suggested the mutual cancella tion of clAims as between himself and His excellency the Shaikh, of Muwalt. Sir Hugh Biscoe did not touch on this point in his despatch Ho. 2 of 5th February 1932 as obviously it was intended to tsover only minor claims. 3. His Majesty wrote his suggested letter and it was given to Colonel Dickson for delivery to His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait, whom it eventually reached, who in due oourse replied, (copies of these were forwarded to you under my printed letter Ho. 42 of the 13th September 1932 (Ho* 659-S to the Government of India and Jodda)), and to whom His Majesty sent an acknowledgment (copy enclosed here- r - &gt; - u T u with) ►s Majesty's SeC^tary of State &gt;r the Colonies, mdon.a i i with). 4 Some apprehension was felt by Bir Hugh Biseoe lest His Majesty should read the widest possible meaning into the shore correspondence and on the 14th March I93g he addressed a communication on the subject to the Political Agent, Kuwait: “Does notjthis (i,e* the correspondence referred to) wipe out the whole of Kuwaiti claims against Hejd in respect of Aichwan raids, etc.? If it does not, I think it would be as well to clear up the matter. 11 The Shaikh, who had not yet recovered from the hypnotising influence of a visit to His Majesty at Riyadh, where he had been well received: ♦‘Definitely and indignantly rejected the idea, that Ibn Baud’s proposal and his acceptance of same, meant that Hu wait's money claims against Hejd in respect of Akhwan raids could be washed out* “What, he said. Bin Baud was obviously thinking about, and what he Mmself certainly understood by the proposal, was that the number of 'bad* Hejd Bedouin camel claims against Kuwaiti© and vice versa had become so numerous of late that it was time seme steps were taken to stop them. u (Vide paragraphs 2 and 3 of Colonel Dickson's reply of 7th April which together with Sir Hugh Biscoe's communication; were forwarded under my printed letter Ho* 38 (Ho« 62b-S to Government of India and Jedda) dated the 6th September 19 32)* There the matter rested until raised by His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, in his telegram Ho. 169 of 2bth August 1932 to the foreign Office (Ho. 227 to Bushlre). b* With regard to the merits of the case as presented by the two parties—Ibn Baud and the Shaikh—there seems no doubt/doubt whatever that the latter's contention is correct, and that both parties intended the agreement to cover only the minor claims indicated in Colonel Dic&amp;son's letter of the 7th April 1932. The fchaiJch would never have accepted Hi® Majesty's proposal if it had been otherwise. Moreover, as Colonel hicicson points out in paragraph 4 of his letter Mo. 163, dated 9th September 1932^copy forwarded to you under my printed letter Mo* 42 (Ho. 659-S to the Government of India and Jedda), dated 13th September 1952), Ion baud could not have known of the Shaikh's Akhwan claims in January last when he made his proposal. In paragraph 3 of the same letter Colonel Dickson produces some further arguments based on the Arabic phraseology used: for instance the expres sion 'between our subjects and your subjects', no mention being made as to the claims as between the two Government a. This latter argument is slightly weakened by the fact that in the above statement (forwarded to you under Sir Hugh Bisece's despatch Ho. 11, dated X3iM May 1931 (copy to the Government of India and Jedda under printed letter Ho. 267H3), Claim 1(a) consists almost entirely of losses by Kuwait subjects in camels, sheep, etc. nevertheless, taking all the circumstances into account, I am sure that any court, having regard particularly to the intentions of the parties concerned at the time of the claims, would give an award in favour of the uhaikh. 6. Unfortunately we are not dealing with an individual subject to a court of law, but with an independent sovereign. The^faet that at the time of the agreement Ibn Baud's intentions were the same as the bhaikh's will not presumably prevent the former from continuing to use his present interpretation, which has sufficient plausibility for his purpose, as a trump card of considerable value.** 4 - ■* It not only will Im probably avoid, or at laaot pout- pona, the meotltlft of thM bojd-iiuwait Bloaaado Qmaiaaicmf about which ha appear a to bo ieso than luiMf-wturm, on tho ground a put forward by imad Httssaa; # it Jta no ua# con cluding further agrooaanta if auoh agrooiaonio are not rrapootod?

Sir, I Have the honour to refer to your tele, ram No.194 dated the 6 th of August, 1932, and to enclose herewith a Note on 'Iraq-Najd trade which has Been prepared in my Secretariat. I have, etc., (Sd.) E.R.Ludlow-Hewitt. Acting High Commissioner for Iraq. ■ Honourable .lip Cunliffe Lister, G.B J2.,P.C.,M.C.,M.P., *etary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street, London, S.W.l.A Note on the present position of Trade 'between Iraq and Najd* Trade between Iraq and Najd is restricted almost entirely to the sales and purchases of goods made by caravans sent into Iraq by the Najdi tribes. The tribes send into Iraq to sell fats, wool and other products of their camel herds and take away dates, rice, wheat, barley, tea, sugar, cloth and other manufactured articles. This trading is called musabilah. The Iraqi towns to which Najdi caravans chiefly resort ere Zubair, Hasariyah, Samawa and ITajaf. Iraqi merchants do not send caravans of goods into Najd to trade. The restrictions which the Najdi Government imposes on Najdi caravans trading with Iraq have generally one or both of the following objects in view:- (i) to raise revenue by imposing a tax on caravans returning to Najd. This tax takes the place of the customs levied by more advanced admini strati on. (ii) to punish a tribe. A tr- : be suffers much hardship if denied musabilah in Iraq. The formand degree of the restriction on control imposed by the Najdi Government on trade with Iraq varies from time to time and as the Iraqi Government are not informed of the orders issued by the Najdi Government in this regard it is always difficult to know precisely what the position is. The following is the latest information available but it should be noted that the present time is not the busy/* 'busy musa'bilah season. This occurs in the Autumn after the ne^ date crop is ripe. The Shammer and 'Dhafir from ITajd are now it seems free to trade with Iraq hut the hut air and Harh are forbidden musabilah with Iraq. Recently however in order to obtain Herb assistance against Ibn Rafada the ban on the Harb was apparently temporarily suspended. The Itfajdi Government impose a tax of 3 llajdi Riyals (about 3 rupees) on every loaded camel returning to hajd from Iraq. This is a heavy tax representing about 50^ of the value of a camel load of barley,30% of a load of wheat and 30% of a load of dates. Fixed routes have been laid down for caravan traffic with Iraq. Caravans trading with Zubair and Nasariyah have to use t be route via Hafar, those resorting to Samawa and Najaf the route via Lina. It has been reported that several caravans which have endeavoured to evade these orders have been captured and their goods confiscated by i^ajdi frontier patrols.—— * — » &gt; AT | k &gt; tmislation of a letter Ho*SOS dated the 86th Jessed Mxml 1381 (87th September 1833) from Hie Majeety King Abdul Asia bln Uaud 9 Riyadh, to Hie Sroellen cy halich air Ataad aWablr aa^Jubah, K«C*1*B« 9 C«3,X #i Huler of Khsralt* After eenpUmexa&amp;s, This Is to Inform Tow Ibceelloney that Ood had f&amp;oilit&amp;ied our arrival to Riyadh In safety and good health, and without any inoonvenienoo, also It is to let you know that the news of our side, and the state of our be affairs is, pralee/to Ood, as desired, In erery direction. % thank God for Us many kind favour®, and pray Him to continue to Increase the seme upon us all, and to grant both of us the power/ to do what Is right and good In this world, and what will bring us reward la tbs neact.

Sir, With reference to paragraph 4 of my despatch No.254 of the 28th July regarding the Nejdi blockade of Kuweit, 1 transmit to you the accompanying copy of a further letter from the Colonial Office from which it will be seen that according to the latest information from the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq a restricted amount of trade is being carried on between Iraq and Nejd by caravan. 2. If discussions with the Hejaz-Nejd Government regarding the blockade of Koweit are resumed in the near future, you may at your discretion use the argument proposed by the late Sir Hugh Biscoe in his despatch No.19 of the 18th May to the effect that the fact that King Ibn Sand permits trade with Iraq, and apparently levies dues upon it, seems to dispose of the main difficulty which the King alleges to exist in the case of trade between Nejd and Koweit. Should some time elapse, however, before you are able to continue those discussions, it would be well to ascertain from His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Bagdad before using this argument that King Ibn Saud has not in the meanwhile reimposed the embargo on trade between Nejd and Iraq, which apparently was recently in force. 1 am etc., (for the Secretary of State) (Sgd) a.f.Rendel. pe-Gill Esq, etc.; • • Jedda. etc.,l ^ &gt;4 fr&amp;Balatlon of a lettor llo«5S6 gated B2M Jmad tteiii mi (23rd October 1932}, from His mjosty Sing ’Abdul ’Aziz bln Sa’uft, to His Ssceellency ahaikh sir Atead al-Jablr as-iiabeh, K*C,I.E* # C.S#I* f Ruler of ICumlt* After compltamts.

(h With reference to Colonial Office letter No. 93048/2/32 of the 11th October, regarding relations between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-^dster that^as at present advised, he is not convinced of the desirability of instructing His Majesty’s Charges d’Affaires at Jedda to take up with Government the Saudi/the question of the correct interpretation to be placed upon the correspondence which passed between King Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Kuwait in January and February last regarding Kuwait claims against King Ibn i^aud and his Government. 2. Sir John Simon feels doubtful whether, judging from the information contained in the enclosures in your letters on this subject ( both numbered 98048/32) of the 16th September and 11th October, the views advanced by the sheikh , and supported by the Political Agent at Kuwait, as to the correct significance of the correspond- -ence are sufficiently well founded to enable a strong case ta be made with King Ibn Saud in theirsupport. If this is so, it seems not unlikely that the only result of taking up the matter with Mng ibn Saud would be the indefinite postponement of the setting up of the proposed joint commission by the King and the Shaikh to consider suggestions for a solution of the problems arising from the King’s blockade of Kuwait. Since it has already _ CjL'xXfr*-** keen agreed that the claims in question should in circum- stances...4 i 11 (-C -circumstances i)e dropped, there might in Sir John Simon s opinion he advantage in at once dropping such use as may he possible of this concession to secure an understanding from King i'bn Saud that he will facilitate the consideration of the questions arising out of the blockade, 3. un the other hand, if there can he little doubt that, as contended by the Sheikh, the Arabic terms used can only reasonably be interpreted as limiting the r correspondence to bad or doubtful claims and also tc / claims between the nationals, as distinct from the Gov- -ernmeets, of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, there would be a stronger case for taking up the point with King Itn Saud. In that event, however, Sir John Simon would suggest that it would be more appropriate and more like- -ly ^ successful that the Sheikh himself should pursue this contention direct with Mng Ibn Saud rather than it should be taken up by kr fiope Gm a t Jedda. The former course would in Sir John Simon’s opinion, have several advantages. The Sheikh could speak more authoritatively than Mr. Hope Gill on this question of the precise meaning of certain local Arabic terms. Secondly, it seems fitter that the Sheikh and the King should themselves settle a misunderstanding as to tfce significance of letters exchanged between them. Thirdly, from the tactical point of view , King Ibn Saud appears from past exprerience far more likely to yield gracefully in such a matter if approached direct by the Sheikh than if the question is made the subject of diplomatic ccrres- -pondence with His Majesty's Government. In addition, it this suggestion is put tc the Sheikh, the nature of his reply will go a long way to indicate whether he is in fact convinced that the words in dispute can rightly only bear.../7&gt; ' D tear the interpretation which he has put forward, or whether, in explaining the matter to Lieut-Golonel Uiekson, he was, as is possible, overstating his case, 4# 1 am to suggest for the consideration of Sir Philip Gunliffe-Lister that, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for India, it would be well to obtain the views of the Poliical B.esid©nt in the Persian Gulf upon the alternative course outlined above. 5* A copy of this letter is being sent to the India 9ffice.

Thanks be to God Who had disgraced him. We sent Kbalid ^bu al-Walid and Hamad as-Sulaiman at the head of 300 men in motor cars, who, helped by God, recover ed Jaizan, after it had been occupied by the Idrisi, and released our servants who had been captured by him. He (the Idrisi} escaped to Sab^a, and from Sabfca, which was also recovered, to the Al-Misarha. Most of the people of Tihama v/ere reassured, Khalid Ibn Luwai, with his army of Muslims, has just proceeded. He will reach within two or three days ana, by God’s help, all the rebels will be destroyed. God’s accustomed promises are always good.

Kuwaiti.Saudi Arabian Claims./ .1514/55• 2 ^rd March, 1935 * Sir, / Jh reply to your letter of the 6th March, 33, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he appr ecfates the reasons for the reluctance of the Sheihh of Kowext definitely to commit himself on the subject of his correspondence of February 1932 with Ibn Saud. As Sir Philip Cunliffe-lister is aware, he feels much sympathy with the Sheihh of Koweit and attaches importance to doing anything possible to meet his legitimate case in regard to the Saudi blockade on his land frontier. But he feels strongly at the same time that if the Sheikh wishes His Majesty’s Government to fight the case for him His Excellency must be prepared to come into the open, and either face the risk of causing offence to Ibn Saud (who has not shown himself unduly tender of Koweiti susceptibilities or interests in recent years) or preferably cease to pursue the point regarding the #aid claims now in issue. He is not disposed to regard the establishment of a committee to give a ruling on the meaning of the correspondence now in question as a satisfactory solution of the difficulty which has arisen. Departments Sir S. Hoare is inclined in these circumstances to think that the Sheikh should be informed that His Majesty’s Government cannot regard the suggestion of a r 2* Subject to the views of the other interested .er Secretary of State Colonial office. committee/ *committee to decide on the interpretation of his letter of l6th February 1932 to Ion Saud as satisfactory, the possible alternatives now appear to be (a) that he should himself pursue the interpretation of the correspondence of last February direct with Ibn Saud, {b) that if he feels reluctant to adopt this course, he should aithorise His Majesty’s Government to inform Ibn Saud on his behalf that he had no intention in the correspondence in question of disposing of any but entirely minor or local claims, or ( 0 ) - which appears to Sir 3. Hoare to be the preferable alternative - that we should accept the position that the situation has been irremediably compromised by the correspondence in question, and wholly abandon these claims (making such merit as is possible of the Sheikh’s acting in doing so) in order to remove the obstacle which they corstitute to the appointment of a Blockade Commission* 5 , Sir S. Hoare would suggest that the Political Resident should be instructed at the outset of his communication to the Sheikh to remind Kis Excellency, in a friendly and sympathetic spirit, of the history of the events which have led to the jx esent impasse » His Majesty Government have all along been making every endeavour to secure a settlement of the blockade question satisfactory to the sheikh. The proposed appointment of a Commission, which appears to be the most promising avenue towards a satisfactory settlement that has yet been suggested, emerged from/from Colonel Bisooe T 3 conversations with Ion Saud in January 13^2, during which the whole subject was discussed from every angle. When this proposal was formally made to the He jaz Government they stated that the King agreed in principle but preferred to postpone the Commission pending a settlement of the question of claims, which had been raised at the same time but which the King contended had already been waived in the Sheikh T s letter of l 6 th February 1'3&gt;2. view to securing the appointment of the Blockade Commission the Sheikh would be well advised to drop the raid claims on which presumably there is virtually no prospect of securing any satisfaction from Ibn Saud, especially as it is impossible to ignore that they have been compromised by the Sheikh 1 s letter of loth February 1932 . He would therefore suggest that the Resident should be instructed, while putting the three alternatives and avoiding any language likely to give offence to the Sheikh, to advise him in favour of course (c) above. In making this suggestion Sir S. Hoare is strongly influenced by the probability that either (a) or (b) would lead to fruitless correspondence which would ire vitably delay, and might altogether jeopardise, the chance ofsettling the blockade question. recent despatches from the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the delay in disposing of this question and the failure of His Majesty’s Government effectively to protect the Sheikh’s interests in regard to it are, apparently, with other factors, contributing to weaken the Sheikh’s belief in the value of the protection afforded him by His 4* It appears to Sir Samuel Hoare that with a 3 . As Sir Philip Cunliffe-lister is aware fromto him. The serious delay which has taken place in advancing the matter now under discussion is to no small extent due (as the loliticnl Resident might be authorised to emphasize to the Sheikh) to the Sheikh's independent correspondence with Ibn Saud and to the difficulty ?/hich has been experienced in securing any definite reply from him to the enquiries made by the Political Resident. It is, at all events, desirable to reduce any further delay to a minimum; and Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that the Resident should oe asked to deal with the matter as expeditiously as possible and on a telegraphic basis, with a view to the early resumption at Jedda of the discussions on the subject of the blockade. 6.

Lieut.-Colonel T.C.Fowle,C.B.E[‘81/420/25 FOBSIGN OFFICE, 3. 7. 1 . 10th April, 1935. / Sir, 7ith reference to India office letter to the Colonial Office, P.3. 1314/33 of the 23ri MarcAi, regarding the correspondence between the Sheikh of Koweit and king Itm Saul on the subject of the Koweiti claims against Saudi s Arabia, I am directed by Secretary Sir Joan Simon to request you to inform Sir Philip Cunliff e-Lis ter that, while he is in general agreement with the views of Sir Samuel Hoare as regards the attitude of the Sheikh of Koweit in this matter, and as regards the unsatisfactory nature of the proposal that a commission should decide on the true interpretation of the Sheikh’s letter of the 16th February, 1932, to king Ibn Saud, he feels that the present is not an appropriate moment to exert pressure on the Sheikh of Koweit to drop these claims. 2. The Sheikh has recently been reported to be labouring under a feeling of grievance against His Majesty’s G-o/ern- ment caused Py his conviction that they na. r e no u exerted themselves sufficiently to Lurther his interest in the matters of his date gardens in Iraq, and of the Saudi blockade of Ko 7 ;eit. The Political Besident in the Persian nulf has stated that this attitude on the part of the Sheikh nay ’.veil unduly prejudice the prospects 0 ;. the ^nglo-Persian Oil Company in its efforts to obtain an oil concession in Koweit: and there seems good ground to fear that toe 3oeikn nay as a result refuse to consider the dnglo-Persian Oil Company*s application for this concession on its merits, but may take a decision against it on purely political grounds, oir -ohn Simon entirely shares the view of Sir Samuel Hoare that the ^ ivn-Pnr situation which has arisen responsibility for the unfor^ , a i m s Gainst Saudi Arabia, and the in regard to the Koweiti clan . „ ir , fovins uo ' ith king Ibn Saud the consequent difficulties m ^kirg . ^ . uinnkade of Koweit, must be attributed to question of his Dlockai e the Sheikh-s ill-advised action in embarking upon ana an inappropriate and apparently eq_uivooal correspondence in the matter of the claims with king Ion Saud, and he considers that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should t&gt;e instructs * to 'bring this home to the Sheikh. None the less, it seems provable that, if His Majesty # s Ogvernment were now to urge the Sheikh to drop the claims, he wopld decline to admit his share of the responsibility for bringing about the situation which has made such^an abandonment of the claims desirable, would represent himself in future as having been obliged to abandon the claims purely as a result of pressure from His Majesty's Government and would make it an additional grievance against His Majesty's Government that they had demurred at taking up the claims with King Ibn Saud on his behalf. It appears particularly undesirable to risk giving the Sheikh a further grievance of this kind against His Majesty's Government at the present moment, while it is still uncertain how far irrelevant political considerations of tnls kind may not influence his decision regarding the proposed' oil concession. 5. Sir John Simon therefore considers it preferable that Lieutenant Colonel Howie should be instructed to approach the Sheijkh on the following lines. His Maje sty ' s Governmen t consider that the Sheikh rust choose one of th e t hree cour ses outlined in paragraph 2 of the India cJ±i£Q_ .letter of .the 23rd March. They consider further that, since the present situation in regard bo the claims arises ol a question of the precise meaning of the Araoic terms used in his personal correspondence with king Ibn Saud, the responsibi i-ity for the situation which has arisen and for taking a decision in the matter r ust rest entirely with him. His Majesty's lovernMent are obviously unable, except on the Sheikh's own authority, to contest King ion Saud's interpretation of the 3heikh's letter of the 16th Hebruary, 1932; and if he refuses Ibn Saud in either of the Government wi11 have no choice io take up the matter wi th king manners propose!, TT is Majesty's but to accent King Ibn Saud f s interpretation of the oorres Ponderce. Lieutenant Colonel Howie should further,further, in Sir John Simon’s opinion, make it clear to the Sheikh thau he r nus t assume the s'ole responsibility for the delay in pursuing with King Ion Saud the question of the Saudi hlockade of Kowei t which will inevitably arise from a refusal on the part of the Sheikh to take a decision as between the * ' 7 ~ -■■■ ■ — ! __ three courses^ p rop osed. 4. Sir John Simon has now-given further consideration to the proposal that the Question of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be dealt vith in the first instance by the institution of a joint Saudi-Koweit commission to consider the matter. .In view of the lapse of time since this proposal was originally endorsed by His Majesty’s Government, of the fact that the proposal when originally out forward was not viewed very hopefully either by the late Lieutenant Colonel Biscce or by His Majesty’s Government, of the unfortunate effect which the long settlement of this question is having upon the general attitude of the Sheikh of Koweit, and on the prosperity of his principality, and, finally, of the reports which have been received to the effect that King Ibn Saud is determined, if p ossicle, to maintain the blockade, Lie Jo on Simon is now inclined to doubt whether this proposal is still adequate to meet the situation. It app^a*---: ^o him ^.a^ action of ^ nature more calculated to indicate to King Ibn ^aud that His Majesty’s Government attach real importance to an early alleviation of the blockade may now ue required, i f any progress in the matter is to be nade »__ 5 # In these circumstances it has occurred to Sir John Simon that, if relations between Saudi Araoia and Transjordan should within the next few months be placed on a more satisfactory footing by the successful conclusion of the negotiations for a treaty settlement, which it is proposed to initiate in the near future, it might oe desirable thereafter , w rrir a- Thn Qaiid on the following lines. It could be to approach King ion oauu. uu j- - — _ , j. n ij-i d i tv that, while His Majesty’s Government wor-o o-iofl to feel that relations between Saudi Arabia and tier two principal northern neighbours, - Iraa and Transjordan •^T'm ,,, „,| JU ,77 ■, . in relation to 'whom His Maj es ty’s vxO/ermiient hold a specialfy/t ! special position, bad been placed on a more satisfactory tasis, one further question of outstanding importance remains r • -1 nr ' for settlement 'before His Majesty’s Government can feel that an entirely satisfactory situation has Peen reached, namely, the - I mill I. , mtawtitw.-. x question of his Plockade of Koweit. The special relations of His Majesty’s Government toward Koweit and undertakings which they have given to the Sheikh place His Majesty’s Government under an obligation to treat it as a matter of serious importance that the earliest possible consideration should be given to the Question of the alleviation of the unhappy situation O • ^ _ .-•...jy.r.;.-.'?0.'A;r-V / •••;•.'.•' '' ' -V'^ in iT i i ir - • ^ ^ ' - in which Ko¥i/eit is placed as a result of the blockade. His Majesty’s Government must therefore request His Majesty to put - | | . | ■ ”' forward at a very early date concrete proposals for an amicable and equitable solution, permitting the resumption of trade - between Koweit and Saudi Arabia. 6 . Should the Question of the Koweiti claims be still outstanding when such . an approach is made to King Ibn Saud, j , n , 11 , ,, ■ n -^.~j&gt;ia^ l ‘ Sir John Simon contemplates that, having jut the matter of tee Blockade in its proper perspective as a matter of importance in regard to which His Majesty’s Government are determined to receive reasonable satisfaction, it .would nou he difficult to insist that the question of the Koweiti claims should oe considered concurrently with that of the blockade, and no^ necessarily beforehand, as a prior condition to further consideration of the cuestion of the blockade as King Ibn Saud now appears to desire; and this might indeed even make it possible to use the claims, as originally contemplated, as some sort of 'bargaining asset. 7. sir John Simon will be glad to receive in due course the observations of the Secretary of State for the Colonies upon the course outlined in the three preceding paragraphs of this letter, and suggests H u ^j j ^^ « I, r^intions between Saudi Arabia and Koweit should Question oi me Lwxciu^uxi- _____ —— -^ 7 ” .

He added that King had been impressed by news of distressful local situation and that if his letter produced good result proposal would in due course be put forward officially. Fuad did not say through what channel this would be done. It may be better not to use this information with Shaikh unless he notifies Political Resident of receipt of letter. In my opinion, this new development must bs consider ed in the light of two possibilities, viz. (A) . King may be genuinely anxious to compose his differences with all his neighbours or (B) He may think he has Shaikh sufficiently at his mercy to establish political ascendency over him by some sort of direct agreement.

Ryan.'A' S 1&gt; Copy, in translation, of a letter No•68, dated the 7th hafar 1552 (23rd May 1933) froiD His Majesty King Ibn Sand to His Sxcellenqy Shaikh Sir iOmed A1 Jabir As- Subah, K• 0• I• H•, C*8*I # , ^.luler of Kuwait. I hope you are perfectly well and enjoying the best of health. Brother! lay God bless thee: It is long since I desired to talk about a certain matter, but fearing that communications would lead to no success, thereby losing all hopes, I was inclined to think that matters would be best settled without referring them to you. You are undoubtedly aware of our relations, both during the past and at present: They are things that can not be explained. Now, lay God preserve thee, things have long been delayed and the world, may the .xLmighty God protect us &gt; both from its evils - is only mortal and so are its people. That this affair of ours (the Kuwait Blockade) should exist between our two countries and two families, and for us to give it no proper attention, is neither beneficial nor advantageous; although of course you must know that it is to my real interests that this matter (the Blockade) should never be settled, and this fact, we presume, is quite clear to you as well as to others. What I have expressed below is my opinion, and it is for you to safeguard your interests if you think it necessary for you to do so. But if it is clear that both our interests are involved then thanks oe to Him, io.c the family is one and our countries are likewise one. I pray God that you will never stand in need oi our help. If it (an agreement between us) is in the inte rests of your country, you should look into the matter,- 2 matter, because I see things are ’shaky* in certain quar ters * »e are not after the wealth of the world, but (it is clear that) with the scanty quantities of imported goods (from other directions), and present (internal) conditions generally, my country would be clearly ruindd and put in critical situation, if the door of trade were opened without conditions. This is what we ourselves perceive, nevertheless it would be a bereavement and loss of our rights were we to revert back to what has been going on heretofore. If we were to Itet matters run as they are, and regained patient, it would mean that we should be broaden ing the gulf. Therefore we propose, subject to your agree ment, the following two ways of solving the problem:- 1. That there should be a unification of yours and our customs (i*‘6. that you should raise your sea customs to the same figure as ours): 2. That we for our part - and indeed we are entitled to do so more than they - should collect such duties on land caravans going into Bejd, as used to be taken (in the old days i. e. 'KHAHA') toy A I'awisli, (j'utair) I bn dash id, Iton r.uwaihi, ha fir) etc. If such were to happen we also for our part ould be prepared to offer you a guarantee for all and sundry (i.e. guarantee the safety of Kuwait goods and caravans going into the interior)* If we can settle this matter secretly between ourselves, It will be well and good for tooth our names and the interests of both our countries. .'e should not listen to the words of those who are deceivers and have toad intentions in this matter. There are two pictures that will always strike a toad minded person. He willwill either eay that Ibn Saud desires to get control of Kuwaitj whereas Kuwait has not been bom since the uaudian regime came into being, but has existed long before. Kuwait always comes to the rescue of the Al ■ aud, and so do the A1 Baud fly to the help of the Kuwaitians. And even were there no obstacle in our way (i.e. of attacking and talcing possession of Kuwait) , By G-od ( we would not do so) for we have no ill will towards Kuwait nor its inhabitants, from its northern limits to its southern limits. Moreover it is not in our interests to do this. And added to everything we may mention that the people inhabiting Kuwait are more dear to us than our very souls. An&amp; more over we fully realize the present sad conditions prevailing in Kuwait. Then there is another matter, I refer to tnat Government (His Majesty’s Government). May &gt;od protect us from her evils. At the moment she is on friendly terms with us, but we greatly fear the consequences t of her friendship with us). My reasons for saying this are many, hut my proofs are clear §.s the sunshine. It is said by some that if the Kuwait Customs Duties were enhanced, imports would decline. hat X say . iyie more than she has done already, is that Kuwait cannot decline more even though some people think otherwise. After studying the Kuwait situation from all its ,-le S , your brother feels bound to make mention of the bl owing last two points, instead of (as he originally intended ■ hint or communicating the matter to you nly giving you a hint, or com-uim hrough some one else. They are as fallows (a) Kfforts from both of us are necessary if Kejd and uwait are both to be assisted: YOU. my Brother, V «« “ „0. to o»d.r..md w present sM.

I have no other alternative to offer: It must be either 'Iltizaa” (i.e.G-uarantoe of safety of caravans going into Hejd) or'Tothing' 9 which latter would put me in a critical position (financially). Neither you nor any Muslim Arab would ever, I think, like such a situation to arise (bankruptcy). After saying what I have said, I hope, by the Grace of God Almighty, that the door of happiness will be opened and the wound in my heart healed. I swear by the God of both Heaven and Earth, that I intended nothing by my writing. It has neither sinister political meaning, nor do I wish to teach you your business. My words are those from a brother to his brother; from a father to his son; from a friend to his friend; andfrom a sufferer to his body. I trust you do not mind what I have said above. If the foregoing is not acceptable, your brother will not take offence. It will be out of friendship and kindness, if you accept what I propose; and will be due to 7/our noble character, and for the advantage of all. Salams to all the brothers and sons. • 0 O 0 iiCopy, in translation, of letter No.3/l026«B dated .••(actual date will be given when letter issues) from His Sxcellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed A1 Jabir As-Subah, L.C.I.-Bi., iiuler of Kuwait to His Majesty King Ibn Baud. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your esteemed favour, for Tahicih I thank you. The friendly tone of your letter under reply coupled with the fatherly sentiments expressed therein, are all due to ^four Majesty’s nobility. I ask Sod that as long as Your Majesty survives, the rela ionship between our two houses, which are really but one body, may continue to remain satisfactory, and stand on the best footing. I fully believe that Your Majesty entertains all I that is advantageous for us, and/also realise that your keen desire is to look after the interests of one and all. It is a well-known fact that Your Majesty places the welfare of your brother and his country (Kuwait) before that of your own private interests, ay Bod the Almighty grant you a long life for the prosperity and progress c£ all. I have no doubt at all about Tour Majesty’s state ment when you say that our respective families aud ountri s are one and the same# Ho doubt your Majesty is the onoindi— vidual capable of rendering assistance in times of prosperity and adversity. It is you alone through whom unity can be achieved. I cannot adequately express my gratitude and esteem for the manner in which you have made known your feelings towards your brother, and I pray that you achieve your- 2 - your aims, and that your enemies and the deceivers be defeated always. Sire, I have carefully gone through what you have been pleased to say with regard to the establishing of w Musabalah ,, (permitting trade) between the two countries. In thanking Your Majesty I value your precious remarks, which I know are intended to be in the interests of both parties, and are the outcome of true love and kindness. With regard to what you say in the matter of the collecting again by Your Majesty of the duties 'Khawa' which used to be levied in the old days by Ibn Bashid, Ad Dawish, and Bin Duwaihi: The idea is a good one, and will not be difficult of enforcement, for the people and tribes of M-ejd are under Your Majesty’s jurisdiction, and will certainly not disobey an order that you find to be in their own interests. Your Majesty is of course far more entitled to take such duties, than the persons mentioned above were. With regard to the question that we should raise our sea customs to the level of yours: Your Majesty may rest assured that whenever possible, we will always be eager to do that which pleases you, as well as give your interests preference over ours. But Your Majesty cannot be unaware of the present sad state of our town, and the peculiar geographical po sition of Kuwait ( in relation to the rest of the Persian Gulf). Kuwait to-day cannot bear a heavier burden than it now carries, both owing to the grave conditions of pover ty that exist, and also to the general financial depression prevailing, irnd in passing let me say that I call God to witness that I have not the slightest suspicion of Your Majesty’s good intentions, when you make the suggestions you have, seeing that we are one family and one house.fit t\ - 3 - r ^ house* Furthermore Your Majesty without doubt is fully aware that we are in close relationship ?/ith His Majesty’s Government, the friend of all. And owing to certain agree ments which have been concluded between us it is not pos sible for us to enhance our sea customs, without a reference being made and an agreement being come to with His Majesty’s Government* In the above connection, however, I beg to take the liberty of inviting Your Majesty’s attention to my let ter dated 15th Hamadhan 1346 (14.2.1930), in vdiich I beg ged Your Majesty to agree to introduce on the frontier cer tain proposals made by Your Majesty* If what was proposed then still meets with your generous approval to-day, why, then we for our part are prepared to endeavour to make it a success, and render all assistance and help in carrying out the arrangement, provided such post be on the frontier, (and not inside our territory). Bucsh assistance to include the submitting of statements ( to your officials) giving details of all goods exported to Hejd in particular' and to other parts of Your Majesty’s dominions generally (manifest system) • Lastly I take the opportunity to repeat once more my thanks and gratitude for Tour Majesty's letter, and beg that your brothers views he given due and sympathetic con sideration, thereby bestowing one more favour over and above the many good deeds already accomplished by Your Tajesty. a b 0 y e counter proposals and I tnust Your Majesty will find •V- iLC them not difficult of acceptance. otller In the event, however, of your having any/proposals or suggestions to make, such as the placing of a string of customs posts along the frontier line, within Kejd territory It is with deepest respects Sire, that I submitA f f rif aBCTP 11 - 4 - territoJT, we for our part will certainly not put any dif ficulties in the way or raise objection; nay, we shall be only too pleased and grateful to render all assistance and help in carrying the proposal through and making it a success. ooo-I Copy, in translation, of letter dated the 15th Ramadhan 1348 ( 14»2,1950 ) from His Ihcoellenoy Shaikh Sir Ahmed Al- Jabir As-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait to His Majesty King Bin Saud* ooo You are aware of the stong and close relationship that existed in the past between our two families. We were and are still desirous of strengthening this relationship but of late,unfortunately, things have occurred which no friend can look upon with indifference. It is in the in terests of both parties that we revert back to the old state of affaiss, and that the blockade may be raised, in such a manner as will neither hurt your interests nor be the sub- ^ y ject of any further ill feeling between us. Shaikh Hafiz ^ jfWahbah has brought to our notice Your Majesty’s suggestions and views regarding 'Musabalah' and I thank your Majesty for your noble and generous feelings towards my country. We willingly agree with one of the suggestions made, nemely, that Your Majesty should establish a single post on the fron tier within the territory of Nejd, from which passes would be issued to those persons who wish to cone to Kuwait and make purchases.

(b) The Shaikhs reply to the King, as sent to you, has at the time of writing not been actually des patched yet. The Shaikh on leaving for Bahrain on 18.6.33. left the draft with his Secretary with orders that he should dhow it to me, get any sug gestions that I had to make incorporated, and send it after him to Bahrain by the Air Mail of 22nd June 1933, when it would be sent to Bin Saud after the Shaikh had finally approved and signed it. Actually the only advice I gave was to the effect that the Shaikh should be extra careful of the wordin of his letter, and that he would do well to point out to the ring, that he could not raise his sea customs without reference to His Majesty’s Government, owing Cl/LUST?. to the existence of a treaty, drawn between him and His Majesty’s Government to this effect. I thought it would be as well to let the King know this if in deed he is not aware of it already. (o) Letter ”0' has been included with fA” and ’’B” above, because the Shaikh has referred to it in his communication to the King. The particular piece of history connected with this letter is as follows:- Immediately after the collapse of the Akhwan rebellion in the Spring of 1930, and after the meeting between the late Lt.-Col.Sir Hugh Biscoe and the King at Khabari Watha, the latter, in evident good mood at having got His Majesty’s Government to assist him, and especially at having had the rebel- leaders handed over to him, wrote to Shaikh Hafith Wahba, who had repaired to Kuwait, and told him to offer three conditions to the Shaikh of Kuwait, anyone of which, if accepted, would be fsignal for him, the King, to raise the blockade. These 5 conditions summarized shortly were as fol lows: - CO The King to establish one central customs post, near the frontier and inside Nejd territory and any iiejd merchant going up to Kuwait to buy goods to report ail# the post on his inwafd and outward journey. &amp;uch merchant to have from his Crovemment a document saying what goods he could purchase from Kuwait, The Shaikh for his part to guarantee that the merchant only took out of the Town what was mentioned in the peimit. (ii) The King to establish a customs post at ouoaihiyeh wells (10 miles inside Kuwait terri tory) and all ilejdis to visit Kuwait free of interference and the Shaikh to guarantee that each caravan tribal or otherwise would be con veyed under guard on its return journey to the post, where duty would be taken* (iii) The • haikh to pay a lump sum annually to the King, the amount to be mutually agreed upon. 'The Shaikh, it seems, regrsSted conditions (ii) and (iii), but wrote to the King accepting U). The King would appear to have thereupon changed his mind, probably because he saw the settlement of the Blockade in sight, a thing he had never wanted* He struck camp and went to Has Tanurah to meet King Faisal and never replied to the Shaikhs letter, nor even referred to it in the subsequent blockade conversations with the late Lt.-Colonel Sir Hugh Biscoe, held at Hoffuf in the Spring of 1952, at which the writer was present. *sm g .. - 4 - ''VO ^ Bote, It seems that the above negotiations were carrie out in secret, for, until he was told the story by the Shaikh’s Secretary on 20th June 1935, the writer was unaware of the exchange of the letters in question or that Shaikh Hafith was carrying on private negotiations. 5* The shaikh in his present reply to the King’s recent letter reminds His Majesty of his letter written on the 15th Ramadhan 1348 (14.2.1930) and says that while he cannot raise his sea customs to that of the King’s Hassa posts for reasons which he explains, he is still willing and ready to agree to the King’s original proposal as mentioned in 2(c) (i) above, or failing that to the placing of a string of Hejd Customs posts along the Kuwait-Nejd frontier: Further that he is prepared to cooperate to the best of his power by means of the tr mani- fest n or other suitable system, provided the King will fall in with either of his counter proposals. 4. In a lengthy interview, which I had with H.E. the Shaikh on the 13th June 1933, and at which Bin oau&amp;s letter was the subject of discussion, the Shaikh gave it as his considered opinion, that the King had written his letter out of nervousness, because, to use his words n He had been given the ’’tip” by his Minister in London to make some move in the matter of the blockade before is Majesty’s Government, who were contemplating bringing pressure to bear on him, could act;’ With this view I am inclined to agree. 5. The Shaikh was very definitely of opinion that the King had nade his letter corfused, garbled, and definitely obscure of set purpose and to confuse issues, and that h.^as determined as ever to make no in the situation. The only one clear point, which change5 which stood out in the King’s letter was the proposal that Kuwait should raise her sea. customs to that of the King’s Kassa ports. This, according to the Shaikh was a ridiculous suggestion and was obviously put forward in the clear knowledge that it would be 'turned down”. Clearly if it were adopted all Kuwait trade would be diverted South in a very short time seeing that the freight to Kuwait from India was already considerably higher than that from India to Ojair or Jubail via Bahrain, and on top of freight charges and equalized cus' toms rates Bin Baud proposed taking the 'Khawa” tax of Rs.S/- per camel going from Kuwait into the interior. The number of these camels in Shaikh Mubaraks time is said to have numbered some 8Q000 per annum and they paid approximately Rs.S40,000/- in 'Khawa” tax, which fell on 6, I asked the Shaikh whether he thought the King’s letter was, possibly, a forerunner to one dealing with the 'Neutral Zone” and the American Oil Interests in Hassa. He replied that he thought not, but that it was not understand any Oil Company applying for an Oil Con cession in Bin Bauds dominions to-day, when there was no guarantee what the future would bring: For, clearly, he said, if the King died to-morrow, there would be general anarchy and then where would the Oil Company be who had i its works in Hassa. the shoulders of^Nejd merchants a possibility, lie then laughingly declared that he could I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Political Agent, Kuwait.

Dated the 21st June 1953. 1* OIL. The most important item in my discussion with Shaikh was that he asked me to confirm that he was free to choose between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Eastern and General Syndicate. I replied in the affirmative but added that this did not apply to the division of territory pro posed by Holmes (see Kuwait telegram 84 of 30th April) and particularly to the Neutral Zone. Before committing himself on these points Shaikh should inform His Majesty’s Govern ment. As in his proposals Holmes had doubtless made inclusion of Neutral Zone a sine qua non Shaikh, on this account or possibly infludnces by considerations suggested in Jedda Savingram of 1st June, presumably thought it best to gain time by temporarily stopping bidding from both parties as reported in my telegram T-l of 15th May. Despatch on Oil from Dickson posted to you by last bag. Though Dickson’s letter to Shaikh did not after all mention oil as Dickson assumes in his despatch, I think latter is pro bably right in his main prognostications. 2. BLOCKADE .
