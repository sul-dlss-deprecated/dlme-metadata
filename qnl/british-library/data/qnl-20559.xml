Jameson, CBE., called to see me on the 14th and | stayed for three hours during which time he reviewed the affairs of the Oil Company here, the world oil position anfl army expenditure in Sngland. As regards the Kuvait Oil Company he asked if ' I thought that there would' 'be any political reaction if the Company closed down for the duration of 1 the war* I said my private viiew was that if] the personnel were not required for essential war work and if material for operations here could be made available without in any way affectiig adversely the course of the war then operations should most certainly be continued for quiet and un^-interrupted work created a very good impression which was not confined to Kuwait alone. It showed that the British and allied Companies were capable of carrying on with the ir peace time work* in ^ it e of a world war and that oir resairces arfi , power were equal to both the successful conclusion of the war and the continuance of peace time undertakings. ||f Mr. Jameson said that material was avails le in Iran and that the personnel were not urgently required elsewhere ani that my views were much the same as his own. He then informed ne that Ma jo* 1 F.Holmes, the Shaikh^ London Representative cf the Kuvait Oil Company had told him that Lt-Col.H.H.P.Dickson, the Chief Local Representative had Ifii^t £he confidence of the Shaikh.

We confirm our conversation of ohe 24th ins cant in which we informed you that the Co pany had been approached by the British Army Authorities in Basrah in connection with their requirements of Burgan Bitumen. If this business eventuates the transportation will be handled by the Army and the material will be mined and delivered by the Company into their vehicles at Burp;an. The Concession Agreement concluded with His Richness the Shaikh entitles the Company to win and sell bitumen but does not, however, entitle them to dispose of the saiid which is an integral part of the 'Bur^ran Bitumen deposit'. We therefore request the consent of His Highness the ShaiKh, to the Company undertaking this and shall be pleased to pay His Highness for the sand at the same rate as paid by the A.I.O.C. for taking sand from Kuwait. In accordance with Article 3 of the Concession Agreement payment on the net petroleum content (i.e.bitumen) shall be either Royalty of Rupees 3 per ton of 2240 lbs or the yearly payment of as ,250,000 now paid to His Highness, whichever shall be ohe greater, no further payment in respect of Royalty is therefore cue unless sales of nett 'petroleum' exceed &gt; 33,333 tons during any concessional year. A In accordance with Article 7 of the Concession Agreement the Company will oay to His Highness the Shaikh, Annas 4 (four only) for each ton of 2240 -Xs of nett bitu:. en content. TAr e nropose that measurement of the material will be by volume (50 cu.ft.boxes) a daily checi being made of the weight of one or two boxes chosen at random.

Following on these discussions a telegram has been despatched to the Company's Principals in London which embodies proposals for the reduction of the Company's organization in Kuwait for the period during which their operations are suspended; the Board's reactions to these proposals, which embraced the following points, are mow awaited:- (1) Continuation of all payments in accordance with the Concession Agreement and advances against future Royalties, (2) Retention of minimum staff in the Area, (probably consisting of Lt-Col. E.R,P, Dicicson, C,I,E,, 'r, A, Pover and possibly one other member of the British staff) after suitable arrangements have been made for the disposal or storage of the Company's plant and stores and the reduction of the existing organization. In addition to the ordinary care-taking the fact that there may be a bitumen contract to supervise has been mentioned. (3) Messrs, A,I,0,C,, Iran, can absorb the British Staff and those of the Indian Staff who desire employment there, (4) Instructions regarding disposal of Messrs, R,L. Kuss and H.A. Guntz, American Staff, have been called for. (5) Paying off of Kuwait Nationals with appropriate bonuses in proportion to length of service. (6) Purchase by A.I.O.C. of material useful to them and storage of remainder pending instructions regarding requirements elsewhere. (7) Anticipated that eventual stage will be attained in about two months. As soon as London's reactions to this telegram have been received I will advise you officially of the action that it is proposed to take, 'Yater Drilling: , The well at Adailiyeh should complete on the 25th instant, water has been encountered in considerable quantity but in each case the ruality is so poor that it does not even approach that usable for animals, A test of the surface sand has yet to be completed after which the outfit will be withdrawn and a report on the well will be eW*. forwarded/ ^ 7-?-^,-^ fl 0.Y S.riS.—2— forwarded.

Limited to His Highness the Ruler of Kuwait. 1 o., f-n 9 -.Copy of letter No,5242 dated 13th August, 1942 from the Kuwait Oil Company Ltd., to His Highness the Ruler of Kuwait. Greetings. In Response to Your Highness 1 request received through I 't, Abdullah Tulla Saleh, we confirm the following points of our conversation of the 8th August, in case there should be any misunderstanding over 'Che interpretation of them:- Vv r ork in hand ; The tidying up of the wells etc, in the Burgan area has been completed and the fencing of well B.G # 9 is in hand, Jell No.K-10 is nearly dismantled and after completion of this work it will be fenced with expanded metal. It is expected that the dismantling at K-IO will be complete on or about the l^th instant. The main work in hand at present is the listing and check ing of plant and materials and the transporting of heavy gear to Shuwaikh. Your Highness asked if all the wells were safe and we informed Your Highness that they were and that a guard post will remain at Warah and that Col. Dickson will be expectec to visit all veils twice a week when the Company^ work has been suspended. Paying; off of Kuwaiti Employees : It has been decided that when the services of the surplus Kuwaiti employees are dispensed with, an ex gratia payment will be made to each individual at the rate of two weeks pay for e each completed year of service. This bonus is granted specific ally in connection with the suspension of uhe Company T s oper ations and should not be regarded as forming a precedent. It is proposed to pay off 15 rigmen in the course of t-he next two or three days and about another 15 at the end of the week, thereafter a steady reduction will follow. Transfer of Staff . Hessrs, Kaclntyre, Wallace and Miss Tull have already left Kuwait and during the next week or ten days Messrs. S. Clark, D, Robinson and D. Dunlop will be leaving. As regards Messrs. Kuss and Guntz further information is awaited from London and America but it seems probable that these two mwmbers of the Staff will leave Kuwait within the next two weeKS or so. When the Staff has been sufficiently reduced it will be possible to commence on the reduction of our engineering services. Plant an d Material , Further details regarding the disposal or otherv/ise of our plant and stores are expected to be received through Mr, N.A. Gass, in the course of the next few days.-2- Suspended Basis . It is proposed to continue to rent the office building in Kuwait and the houses occupied by Messrs. Scott and Campbell, the house occupied by our clerks, owned by Kr. Yousuf Yacub, will also be retained for the present. Guard posts will be maintained at Kagwa, Warah and Shuwaikh and except for these posts Magwa will probably be shut down as a residential area; the workmen who are retained, will live at their homes in the town and will be sent out to work daily. Medical Ser vice. The services of the Mission Doctor will continue to be retained and when our Assistant Surgeon can be released, arran gements will be made for the Fission Dispenser to visit T'agwa and Warah guard posts and the work at Burgan every other day, to hold a sick parade. Any hospital cases will be brought to the Fission Hospital. Scholarship Students , Bahrain Technical School . The five students who commenced their course at t he Bahrain Technical School last spring will continue until the completion of the training period. General- All payments vide our Concession Agreement together with advances against Royalty will continue to be made as heretofore. Bur.^an Bitumen Contrect . The contract for the supply of Bitumen to the Army has been completed and the excavation of the bitumen has now com menced. The Army having sent down their vehicles without giving us adequate time to obtain the necessary eouipment from Abadan, has assisted us by providing temporarily a compressor and dig ging unit to help with the work. With this assistance it is expected that an approximate daily output of 400 cu.ft (14 to 15 tons) will be obtained. The system of measurement that was agreed, vide out? letter 5S94 of 30/5/42 has been put into operation. The quality check of the bitumen is carried out by first weighing a small quantity of the material and then washing it in kerosene and petrol until all trace of bitumen is removed, the sand residue is then dried and weighed. The difference between the result of the two weighings being the weight of the actual bitumen content. Daily statements of the am : ;.ount of the material mined and delivered into the army trucks are forwarded to our Kuwait Office and a weekly summary of these will be forwarded to H.H's Official Representative. An enquiry was then made as to whether Your Highness wished to take any other measures to safeguard Your Highness* interests in the matter. It was understood that Your Highness indicated that you would like to consider the matter. Subsequently it was stated that Hr. Pover would be in charge of the bitumen work and that Abdul Salaam would act as his overseer at Burgan.-3- It v/as anticipated that the extra equipment from Abadan would arrive within the next week or so and that the bitumen work would be on a sound producing basis in about two weeKS time.Extract from enclosure to India Cffic letter No.3.&amp;C. lobdO/iZ of 27.7.42. ★ ifa 'at -^r st 10 * From: KU ...IT CII OC .

After discussion I told him that subject to expert opinion best site for tanker anchorages was in DUHAT KADHAVA (Admiralty chart of Kuwait harbour and approaches) and this apparently coincided with technical advice they had received. He said that there was no plan to use Khor Abdullah which would involve unnecessary extension of pipe-lines. 3. I advised him in any negotiations v/ith the Irakis to make it very clear that Company were in no way bound to pipe line and could supply themselves easily by tanker from Shatt al Arab, and suggested that their American element might be useful stalking horse with Iraqis as they v/ould be more reluctant to offend United States interests after war. 1 also drew attention to possibilities of obtaining existing military water pipe-line to Shaiba after the war when it will presumably be a white elephant. - BRITCONSUX - 'SECRST.

I now enclose copies of 'Certified True Copies' of the No. 150.relevant letters as noted in the margin. I am filing the dated M4. 'Certified True Copies' 1 with my records. You will also remember that I expressed some doubt on the question as to whether the Company should have conducted their negotiations with the Shaikh in this matter through my self as Political Agent; andthat you asked me to let you have a considered opinion on the question. The clause relative to it in the Political Agreement oetween His Majesty's Government and the Company^which I had in mind^is No.4 and reads as follows; 'One of the superior local employees of the company shall be designated chief local representative of the Company in Kuwait. The approval of His Majesty's Government shall be required for the person so designated. He will be ordinarily resident at Kuwait and will be responsible for the Company's local relations with the Kuwait authorities. These local relations shall always be conducted through the Political Agent at Kuwait, except as regards routine commercial business, which may be transacted through the official representative {if any) whom the Shaikh may appoint under the agreement between the Company and the Shaikh.' It seems to me, on consideration, quite fair to argue that this clause only concerns the 'local relations' of the Company; that the arrangements regarding advances of Royalty ^re not part of '•local relations'; and (as is in fact the case) » \ L\lV L--v; . that/ I 'V ^2, %H) that there is no other provision in the Political Agreement (or in the Commercial Agreement 'between the Company and the Shaikh) making it incumbent on the Company to negotiate such arrangements through the Political authorities. 7e would not, therefore, have a strong case for insisting that, according to the letter of the agreements, the Company should negotiate through us. , again after consideration, do I think that it is at all expedient or necessary that we should do so on general grounds. Ordinarily^ even we cannot touch oil^and not 'be defiled. The fact that the Shaikh did not refer to me during these recent negotations may, I think, be taken to imply,not that he distrusts the Political authorities, 'but that he trusts the Company in the person of Jameson well enough to 'be a'ble to dispense with our advice; this is to the good. Further, this fact precludes the Shaikh from having any complaint against us if (which G-od forbid*) the new agreement should not turn out to his liking. The Company, as you know, informed me (withal very informally) of the result of the negotations thus admitting our ultimate directive right in their activities, and their desire to have us on their side. TJiis is also to the good. Finally, in this as in other similar cases, I 'believe that the parties concerned will come to us if they have any trouble; and that, provided Government's interests are not threatened, it is better to leave them alone if they do not do so. The other course - direct interference - is likely to saddle us with undesirable and unnecessary responsibilities for (occassion- ally) murky commercial transactions and, in the case of a man like the Shaikh, to cheapen our help in his eyes when it is f preferred unasked. If you generally agree, then the only action now required is to send copies of the enclosures to His Majesty^ Government and to the Government of India for information.

I prefer seeing him here than at the Agency where he is always rather on his dignity, but on the floor of his majalis he feels more at home and can put his mouth to my ear and let himsell go. He was more friendly and communicative, and told me privately that Ibn Saud had made overtures to him to get rid of his British Oil Company ( I could not discover the date of the overtures but it was apparently not very long ago) as he was sure he would get better results from an iimerican Company. He also urged him to give his share of the Neutral Zone to the same Company as Ibn Saud but the Shakih re-iterated his intention of giving it to nobody at present. YG.Kt# c I .326^2,4.

The Oonrpany was instructed in April last to take the necessary measures to produce 30,000 'barrels* of crude oil daily 'by Ipril 1946. 'For various reasons it is considered that this n0 ^ ^6 possible and that crude oil cannot 'be produced until June. The plans which the Company have prepared involve : (a) The following increases in personnel : September 1945 January 1946 (Peak figure) Senior staff (British and American) 56 85 Junior Staff (mostly Indians) 54 • 64 Art is ans (Indians, Iraq.is or Persians) 80 120 Labour (local if possible) 500 630 Local contract labour 500 760 Total 1190 1659 The final figures when construction is coinpleted will 'be somewhere 'between the two sets given above. (b) The unloading between now and the target date of 14,000 tons of equipment from the United Kingdom and the United States and 3,000 from Abadan, besides bringing 4,000 tons of shingle from SuMya, ana (c) The production of sufficient drinking /rater for employees. To do this two wells have been sunk at Dhulai and at al Awazim, 28 miles south west of Kuwait, and fairly sweet water has been found at a depth of 500 feet. Each well produces 140 gallons per minute by air lift and more can be sunk if necessary. Unfortunately the doctors will not pass for drinking water with more than 800 parts of dissolved salts per million while that found has 3,732 parts salts of which 50 % is calcium sulphate. An evaporator is therefore essential and is required to arrive in September, in fact it cannot be shipped until January 1946 (see paragraph 11). 2. As the matter is being treated as a war project the production of oil will be tackled first and the housing of staff and employees afterwards. In the meantime the present camp at Magwa will be expanded. 3. The method of production to be followed is that the oil from the Burgan field is to be pumped into tanks on the Dhahra ridge inland of iTahahil, in the neighbourhood of which an export loading terminal will be constructed. This camp will eventually be laid out in the same area on high ground over looking the sea, and a refinery, if one is built, will be / constructed * Thirtyfive Imperial gallons per barrel, seven barrels per ton.- 2 - constructed nearby. 4. The pipelines (including ICt miles 10 inch, 5 J miles 22 inch and 1 mile 12 inch submarine, as well as nearly 80 miles of water pipelines mostly of small calibre) will l^e constructed 'by a unit of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company. Although upwards of 100 of the personnel will loe Persians they will te self- contained and are expected to give no trouble, 5. The same may not iDe the case with the personnel of the Motherwell Bridge and Engineering Company who will construct the tanks. The most important tanks 7d.ll 'be the four containing a total of 4.7 million gallons to 'be 'built at Eihahra. The men will 'be British rivetters and welders straight from the United Kingdom. PA3T II. Local Repercussions . 6. (See paragraph 1). His Highness will draw in the first year approximately £ 200,000 in royalties out of which he will have to pay tack advance royalties drawn, so that the total paid to him may not actually 'be more than a million rupees. In the second year he will pro'bat)ly dra*/ £ 390,000*. if this goes into his own pocket as at present and no attempt is made to share it 'with the State and to modernise the administration, I foresee serious constitutional troubles. Particularly will this 'be the case as the receipt of royalties will protalDly coincide with the removal of British forces from Iraq, and the cessation ol the trade 'boom which has kept the town prosperous and the merchants 'busy and out of mischief in the last few years. v. See paragraph 1 (a). The increased employment would, before the war, have 'been very welcome for its beneficial effect on local conditions. iTow the position is reversed. All available labour is 'busy 'building houses for profiteers and the rates 'being paid are fantastically high (unskilled labour annas twelve per day pre-war against Rs 5/- per day now). The demands of the Oil Company may well aggravate this as the amount of labour available is very small. I am in favour of the company importing labour if local labour is not forthcoming at a competitive rate and I anticipate that the State authorities can be persuaded to agree to this in their own interests. 8. At present the State allows the Kuwait Oil Company labour to draw two ration cards per man and the company are working on the assumption that this concession will be continued. The ration is thus brought up to, but not beyond, the Abadan ration in cereals and tea. I have informed the Company that I will, if necessary, press the State to continue the concession provided Kuwait secures additional supplies of tea and provided there is no reduction in the wheat quota. The company will then only have to import sufficient foods to bring the ration up to a balanced diet. 9. The number of Americans employed will probably not exceed twenty at a very generous estimate. 10. See paragraph 1 (b). It is doubtful if London can or will provide adequate unloading equipment and they are pressing the Kuwait Oil Company to utilise the services of the Kuwait Landing and Transportation Company. This Company has recently doubled its rates^, bringing them up to the very high figure of Rs 20/- per ton (actual cost of unloading cargo Rs 4/- per ton). Of the / profits * These figures and those of the probable quantities of oil Hi^esTr 064 haVe n0t yet been di ^°sed to His. % are devoted to the State Revenue, Public Health and 3cluGation Departments in a similar manner to the ^ oustoms takings. A large proportion of the ending company's charges are therefore nothing less than a camouflaged customs duty and the Kuwait Oil Company are GX6. r iipo from paying customs.

Allcard, we endeavoured to get into touch with the Political Agent but found he would not be available until the following day. I was also able to ascertain that Lr. '..ard Anderson was on a visit to the Lainland and would not return until the 7th. On the morning of the 6th a meeting took place between Lr. Pelly the Political Agent at Bahrein, hr, Allcard and myself. After explaining the purpose of my visit, Ivvr. Pelly admitted that the report made to the Political Resident, which was the subject of the references received by Head Office from the India Office, emanated from him, and the complaints recorded were formulated after a number of discussions with officials of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. I mentioned that such complaints had not been referred to Mr. Allcard during the short period he had been in Bahrein, and this was admitted b^ Lr. Pell} vJio stated that, according to information given to him by Lr. Ward Anderson, numerous complaints had been made in the past upon which no action appeared to have been taken, since there was no apparent improvement in the services being provided by our Company. In view of the importance of the points at issue, Mr. Pelly consider d it necessary, therefore, that since the Oil Company were pressing to be allowed to make their own arrangements for lighterage, prompt reference to the Political Resident, and possibly still higher authority, was essential in an effort to obtain an improvement in existing conditions. Lr. Allcard stated that although he had been in close touch with the senior officials of 'Bapce' they had made no specific complaints to him, but admitted he was aware of the fact that the service being provided b^ us was consider d inadequate, and he hac taken certain steps with his limited available resources in men in order to improve matters. It was agreed that a meeting should be arranged with Lr. Ward Anderson immediately upon his return from the Lainland and Lr. Pelly undertook to arrange for this at the earliest possible opportunity. I requested Lr. Pelly to be good enough to give us the advantage of his good offices by attending any meetings which took place, and this he very readily agreed to do. Lr. v-ard Anderson arrived back in Bahrein the following morning, and we were invited to call at his Office immediately. This meeting was attended by Mr. Pelly, the Political Agent; Mr. V.ard Anderson, General Lanager of Bapco; -Mr. Russell Brown, Asstt. General Lanager, Bapco; Lr. Beekhuis, Chief Accountant, Bapco; Mr. Allcard and myself. Mr. Pelly, when introducing me, explained that I was visiting them under express instructions from my Head Office in London, and that I should be very glad if they would give full expression to their viev/s on the matters connected with the complaints already registered through him. I asked Lr. Ward Anderson to be frank in expressing his opinions in order that there could be no misunderstanding as to their exact feelings concerning the work we have been performing on their behalf. I assured Lr. V.ard Anderson that it v.as the desire of the Company to do everything possible to meet them and ensure that a satisfactory service v/ould be provided in the future. He explained that the nature of the complaints they were making -were not new, as they had been expressed on many occasions previously to the Managers of our Branch at Bahrein, and that in fact at no time, from the commencement of the arrangements with us, had they been able to abtain entire satisfaction, although many promises had^been made. He stated that their principal complaints could be summarised under three main headings 1. Lack of supervision on board ships in the matter of slinging cargo, stowage in barges and prevention pilxerage.-2- \ 2, Inefficient tallying on board ship and at delivery points on shore coupled with inadequate precautions for prevention of pilferage in barges and during discharge. 3, The high scale of our cherges for services performed. Emphasis was laid on the view of the Oil Company that the type of local supervisors employed by us was inexperienced and totally unalbe to control the labour working on board ships and in barges. Consequently valuable cargo was not iandled and stowed in the manner they wer. entitled to expect and he w-ould even go so gar as to say that the class of supervisors anc Checkers provided instead of acting as a deterrent to Pilferage was, in all probability, an encouragement. Lr. '..ard Anderson rcks went on to say that no useful purpose could now be served tp eithir party by indulging in recriminations regarding what had happened in the past but he felt he had ample Justification for placing before the Political Agent directly, without further reference to us, the main grounds for their dissatisfaction since they w r er confident their iDwn organisation was in a position to furnish much better service in the matters which formed the complaint. Ke made it clear also that he was not particularly interested in whether Gray Lackenzie or 'any other party did the work for them so long as they obtained that degree of satisfaction for which they paying. The Oil Company look at it in the light of a seller and a buyer, and if we are not in a position to sell to their satisfaction the particular commodity they wish to buy - in this case proper care of their cargo from ship to shore - they must look ^or ^ some other avenue by which it can be provided. It must be admitted that this is not an unreasonable point of view. He agreed we had numerous difficulties to contend with but maintained it was our concern to overcome them. On the question of charges he advised that based on figures which they had compiled in 194L they estimatec tna.t the^ themselves could have provided lighterage and other essential services with t..eir ov.n personnel in the manner they required at a co^t not- exceeding Rs.2/- per ton, as against the scale oeing charged by us. In addition their figure would have allowed for the complete amortisation of capital expenditure on lighters and equipment between 124^ and the present time. He reiterated, however, that on our present assurance of our desire to improve conditions, he vas prepared to suppiy us with details of their future plans in order that we could get together with them and work out afrangements which woula be to our mutual advantage. He went on to say that witn the new ^ausevay now corpleted and the new Wharves expected to oe m operation j March of next year, they would require us to ti ve amencea que.a.ions for the following work;- 1, Lighterage from ships delivering at uitra anchorage to delivery point at the old Sitra Jetty. P Li?hterare from ships delivering at Manama anchorage to discharge over the old Sitra Jetty. (It is not anticipated that the quantity handled in this way will be large/ 3. Lighterage from the Sitraanchorage (and from Manama) to tie new Causeway. 4. Lighterage for cargo received overside from vessels berthed at the new Wharves to the new Causeway. 5. Stacking and reloading into motor vehicles on the new V.harves. Note; It was pointed out that it was doubtful whether we would be asked eventually to undertake this v.ork, as in view of the arf-=&gt;utions necessary for fire security purposes, it was their intention to train their own Irbour gangs and checkers for tr.is worK. Labour for working ships at the V.harves would have to be pro^xuedus in the usual way, and emphasis was laid upon the necessity for precautions being taken against fire in view of the hazards involved since these it«harves will also be utilised as delivery points for bulk oil deliveries to tankers etc. A request was made for estimated tonnages to be handled monthly over the various discharge points but up to the time of s my leaving Bahrein these had not been received. Their proposed programme extends to 1947. During the discussion no reference was made to the fourth point mentioned in London 1 s telegrem No. 34, i.e. use by us of our best personnel and material for work at Ras Tanura but it was explained by 1-r. -wlcard that it wss intended, almost immediately, to put into operation a new scheme whereby all lighterage, supervision, labour, etc. would be centralised under one control from Bahrein, and it was generally agreed that this would make for more satisfactory and efficient working. It was suggested that, to cover the new proposed arrangements, an agreement should be entered into clearly defining our obligations and embodying revised rates of charges which the Oil Company insist are necessary if we are to continue to work together. It was clearly indicated that if we can made our arrangements to fit in with their requirements they will be pleased to continue^ to work with us. I/r. Pelly asked Lr. V.ard Anderson to confirm that on our assurance that steps wert being taken to put matters ri-ht he would withdraw Bapco's request to be permitted to make their mvn arrangements for discharging their cargoes in the future and he confirmed that this was so. I promised that the question would be discussed full^ by Mr. Allcard and myself, but that in the matter of personel it might take a little time to complete the organisation we visualised in view of the difficulty in obtaining men, and that, in any case, so far as costs were concerned, Mr. Allcard should be in a position in a few cays time to give them our ideas on the question of amended quotations. This concluded our discussions which I should add were frank and cordial on both sides. The only stipulations 'Bapco' had to make in regard to the terms of the proposed agreement v/ere that clauses should be inserted enabling either party to withdraw by giving notice for a specified period and that provision should be made for reconsideration of the scale of charges at periodic intervals to be agreed. V.e indicated we had no objection to these provisos. I'r. Allcard has been left to conclude the negotiations with the Oil Company and to report to you when a satisfactory conclusion has been reached. Mr. Pelly left for Shiraz on the evening of the 7th instant, following our meeting \ ith 'Bapco' officials, so that unfortunately we did not have the advantage of his presence during the subsequent discussions w T e had with I.Ir. Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrein, and the Army and Jl.A.F. representatives. I called on Ivlr. Belgrave by appo'ntment on the 8th, and explained to him the reasons for my visit. He expressed surprise that the Bahrain Government should have been associated with any complaint registered against Gray Lackenzie Co., and stated that he had made none either to the Political Agent or to any other aiajc party. He did recollect, however, that during general discussions with the Political Agent the question of the heavy increase in the amount of pilferage and smuggling that was going on in the Bahrein area had formed a subject and that they were all very concerned in tie matter with the object of endeavouring to ensure that adequate preventive precautions were being taken. Mr. Belgrave said that it might have been because of this that it had been assumed a specific complaint had been made although he was definite on the point, so far as he was concerned, that no allegations were levelled against Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co. He agreed that we were working in the closest possible co-operation with the local police, who maintain regular motor boat patrols and that apart from what we-4- were doing, he had no further suggestions to make. Recently there had been a number of convictions in the local Courts for pilferage and smuggling and very heavy sentences had been given. Mr, Belgrave informed us that the Government of Bahrein had recruited from U.K. one Police Sergeant and six Constables who were expected in Bahrein in the near future, and that is is intended that these men should be employed in an endeavour to break up these activities as 1hey now appeared to be organising themselves into gangs. I asked Mr. Bel^rave whether he had received complaints from any source concerning the neglect on our part of passengers embarking or disembarking at Bahrein, and he stated that he knew of no such complaint. It is interesting to note thst a similar reply was given by Mr. Pell&gt; when the matter was mentioned to him and he promised to enquire into it if we would write to him on the subject. This was done and Mr. Allcard no doubt will be sending on a copy of the Kply received. Following my talk with llv, Belgrave I had the opportunity of meeting the Army and R.A.F. representatives who deal with the move ment of all cargo and personnel at Bahrein - Capt, Benbow is the British Army Movements Officer and F /Lieut. Baird, the R.A.F. Liaison Officer, both of whom attend actt all M.V. .T. meetings and are in dail\ contact with Iv'r. Allcard. They expressed surprise at the reports' referred to in London's telegram and assured me they had not emanated from them. Prior to leaving Busreh for Bahrein. I^ took the opportunity of ascertaining from the L.V.T. Representative and the Service Departments concerned if they knew of any complaints against our organisation at Bahrein, and was assured that on the contrary signals had been sent congratulating all concerned, including Gray It ackenzie &amp; Co., on their performance in the handling of the large quantities of materials now being dealt with at the port. I mention this as it appears to me the allegations concerning neglect of passengers is probably made by the Political Staff under the misapprehension that we have control of the allocation of passenger^ accommodation, which is a matter on v.i. Lch v/e act under the instruction of lu.V«.T., Busreh. I have been asked by Head Office to ascertain the root of the trouble and there is no doubt in my mind \vhere this originates - inexperienced and incompetent native Supervisors and ChecKers combined with lack of sufficient European Staff to maintain constant, contact on board ships and on shore. This is the hub around allien the whole of our landing arrangements revolve, and if there is faulty performance right from the start of our operations, we cannot hope to carry out the work without acverse criticism. Owing to the demands from various sources, such as the Oil Companies themselves and the Services, it is extremely difficult to retain rood labour but since ships can be worked with the men made available riven close and efficient supervision in the matter 01 slj.-.g ir ig Ind stowage, the cause of complaints in this regard should be eliminated. Complaints over inadequate precautions against oilferare can also be considered complementary to tie absence of effective supervision throughout the period when the cargo is m our care. The standard of local Supervisor obtainable in Bahrein is extremely lov, and although efforts have been made to recruit trained Iraois there has been little or no success owing to their reluctance to ac-eot employment in Bahrein in spite of the high terms v;e are prepared to offer. In my opinion, if v.e intend to continue with this business, the onlj satisfactory solution would be to obtain the services of British Supervisors experienced in the handing, slinEinp ana stowage of heavy equipment as well ' - possessing the ''bility 0 to control- local Supervisors, i'ally clerks and laoour. The tvoe of men who could probably be used to best advantage on such work would be those I.W.T. personnel v.e previously consiaered for employment on the Bahrein Petrol project, and if we could obtain the release of two additional men, similar in type to i.r. nraysnaw,5 they would meet our immediate recmrrements. The difficulty in obtain ing such releases even now is appreciated, and in order to ensure that assistance is sent without delay I am endeavouring to obtain the serivces of two experienced Supervisors from Busreh who canl® sent there on temporary duty until more permanent afrangements can be made. Even if we have to pay unusually high wages in obtaining the services of such men it is essential that conditions at 3itra should be improved as soon as possible in order to prove to 'Bapco' that we are taking immediate steps to put our house in order. It is considered that ve have sufficient craft and cargo gear available in the area to take care of present and known commitments for the future, so that our requirements can be stated definitely to be supervisory personnel. Following upon the question of the engagement of further sfaff ^ for Bahrein comes that of accommodation. The proposal to erect a new bungalow, if approved by the Company, in time will relieve the position very considerably as this would permit of all staff being accommodated in the house above the Office and the tv.o houses at present under lease to us. This would mean that, apart from the manager, nine or ten Assistants coulc be accommodated, if required. As soon as it is possible to obtain supplies it will be necessary to order Linen, Crockery, Cutlery and Glassware sufficient for two houses. SGD/- \v.S. GREGOR 4122, Leadenhall Jtreet, London, E.G.3. 28th August, 1945. Dear Jir Cecil, I Further to my letter of 24th instant, I now enclose two abridged copies of the report made by T.:r. Gre?or, our General Manager at Busreh, who was specially sent down to Bahrein to investigate the complaints which had been made. I have merely omitted certain parts of the report which deal with purely domestic matters and which have no bearing on the points at issue. The Mr. Allcard referred to in the report is our Manager at Bahrein. The report fully confirms what I said at the meeting on 6th July, that our difficulties have arisen almost solely through our inability to obtain suitable personnel to deal with the largely increased volume of traffic, but I hope y now that the :ar is over, we shall be able - probably with your kind assis tance - to get the men we require. With regard to the question of charges, you will appreciate that the maintenance of a lighterage plant ^n an area like the Persian Gulf is an expensive business but nevertheless our Bahrein Manager is going closely into figures and I hope it will be possible to make some reduction. As already informed you, now that fuller information has been furnished regarding alleged defects in the handling of passengers, the matter is being fully investigated, and I will advise you the result in due course. Koweit Oil Comn; ny V/e have arranged to transfer four barges from Ras Tanura to Koweit to deal with the increasing quantities of cargo there, and we are proposing to contract on a tonnage basis. You will remember that at the meeting on 5th July Mr.Campbell enquired of Sir Geoffrey Prior whether he anticipated any objection being raised by the Shaikh, and he said he did not think there would be any difficulty. ^e have, however, received a telegram from Busreh stating that they understand both the Shaikh and the Political Agent are opposed to our undertaking the landing. Perhaps you would be good enough to have a telegram sent to the Political Resident with the object of seeing that whatever objections there ray be can be overcome. In the meantime, we are trying to establish contact with Mr.Scott of &gt;the Kuwait Oil Company who is reported to be in this country. :/ith thanks in anticipation of your assistance. Yours sincerely, C^gd) G.?.Hotblack. Sir Cecil Kisch, K.C.I.E., India Office, .Vhitehall, S.J.I. P.S. I have taken the liberty of passing a copy of the report and my letter to you to Sir Geoffrey Prior, which I hope meets with your approval.122, Leadenhall Street, London, E.G.3. 31st August, 1945. Dear Mr. Donaldson, I am extremely obliged to you for your letter of 30th 'v i ^ lfo r^ in ^ me that you have now heard from the Political 7?^ 6 Persian Gulf that at a meeting at Bahrein on the 7th Auguso, arranged by the x^olitical Agent and at which he .vas^ present, between the General Manager, Basra, of Gray Mack- enzie d: Co., and the General Manager of the Bahrein Petroleum Co., mao.ers were fully discussed and the conclusions detailed in your letter arrived at. This is, as you say, satisfactory so xar as it goes, and we have been proceeding with all despatch carry ^.irough the measures for imorovement which have been under discussion. 1. 2. 3. 4. I a.i in close touch with 3 Cargo Superintendents ana we hope to conclude arrangements within the next fei'/ days, and that the men will be able to leave towards the end of September. We have sanctioned the building of an additional bungalow at Bahrein at an approximate cost of £4,000, Our Basra Office has received estimates for the construction of a slipway at Bahrein, but details have not yet been received in this country. I am arranging for Mr. Armour, who was for many years in charge, to proceed in October to the Persian Gulf. ■Ve are gradually getting some of our men on leave and are keeping in the closest touch with any suit able young men to send out to make good the break in the normal flow of young Assistants owing to the War.

Dear Mr. Donaldson, I am exceedingly obliged by your letter of the 5rd ► September.

Armour arrives in the Persian Gulf he will, as you suggest, get in touoh with the Petroleum representative in Cairo and Baghdad. (3) We had a call from Mr. Scott of the Koweit Petroleum Co. with regard to the supply of barges for Koweit* He informed us that we should not be allowed to operate barges in Koweit or to land cargo from them as the landing of merchandise in Koweit is reserved for the local organisation in which the Sheikh is financially interested. ^hat the Oil Companies desire is that we should place the barges at their disposal on a bare boat basis, as they require steel barges to load some constructional material which oannot conveniently be carried by existing wooden barges, (4) We have placed two steel barges at their disposal and another two will be made available within the next week, but the Oil Companies must realise that as we are debarred from literage work in Koweit we cannot he expected to make special barges available at that port when they are urgently required for our own business at other ports. At the same time we are always anxious to oblige the Oil Companies wherever they are in the Gulf where we can reasonably do so, having regard to our own business. we understand that in any case the special barges are only required for a limited period. 1 think I should pass this information on to you as it does put a different complexion on the matter, but does not alter our willingness to help whenever we can.

(1) That it appears that the bert policy for His IJaJest^s Governceiit to adopt would be publicly to recognise that the principles contained in the United States proclamation with jrespcct to mtui al resour ces of the aiib -soil and sea bed of the continental Shelf are sound and of general a, plication. It wiildrpreferablc to issue a public statement recognising these principles than for I!ls IJa^jesty • s Goyerncient ixsnediately to, issue a sirdlnr proclamation applying these princi les legislatively to all 'British' territory since the draftinc Of such a general proclamation v^juld at onoe involve questions as to whether it should be extended to protected otates and other dependencies whoso position is oonewtiat complicritcd. t (2) That if (l) is approved and acted upon, the Governor of the Bahamas and the Governor of Jamaica might make proclamations applying these principles to the sea bed adjoining the Bahamas and Jamaica respectively. These tvo cases seem to bo clear since the geographical situation is exactly similar to that off the coast of the United States and they are Moreover in the saj® general goorraphical area. (5) That an investigation should be begun imnediately as the the application of these principles in other parts of the uorld* In particular the case of the Persian Gulf seems to demand particularly early and detailed I consideration. The Persian Gulf Is so shallow that the whole of it might be considered to be a continental shelf within the meanin of the United states proclamation awJ therefore as on area where the shariir of the t helf between the Adjacent states should be determined on equitable principles. In this connection the clai.is to jurisdiction over the bed of the sea over pearl fisheries might be taken into c &gt;r rider at ion. (4) Porticul r attention Is directed to the last sentence of the United States proclamation that the character as hir 'h seas of the water above the continental shelf and their ri ht to free and unimpeded navigation are in no way affected* In this connection possibly submorine cables which merely touch the bottom mirht be considered rather to be in the water t -an on the surface. (5) Supposing - that tlte conclusions above are adopted, it v/ould secta desirable that before any action is taken the Governm ntscf India and the ocdnior* should be inTonaed or consulted and no doUbt the Foreign Officewuld also consult the Kcfcassy at T.aehin ton att! indeed any other of Its missions which it is thought 'cEirable* i^urther, it may we argued that since the free and unirpeded rirht of navigation jls reco nised and is already in existence, any constructions made above ' sea bed for the purposes of exijloitation of nincrols below It must be such as not to impede navigation# The application of this point in the Pt^raian Gulf moy acme Uat iLportant. . _ .,2. m , iTffiRKFOHK, I, HARRY 3, TRUMAN, rresident of tlie United States of Anertoa, do hareby .roolal i the follcrvin i-olloy of the Utiited tates of .v «rica withres^ot lo the naw ral reoouroea of the subsoil and aea bed of he oontinentai ahelf# Having aonoom for tlie urgenay of anaerving and ^jcnadontly utilizing its natural resources, the Govemnont of the United State regards ths natural re source a of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental ahelf beneath the hi^h seas 'out ^onti^u.Ais bo the coasl of the United ^States as appertaining to the united States, sub ject to its Jurisdiction ami control# In cases here the continental ahelf extends to the shores of another State, or is shared with a^i adjacent State, the boundary ehail be determined by the united ti and the state concerned in acoocrdanoe vdLth equitable principles* The character as hij^x seas of the waters above the ocntinental and the right to their free attl uninpodod navigation arc In no way thus affaoted.

He told me that he had received instructions to make plans for a rapid expansion of the operations of the Kuwait Oil Company, and that there were two points upon which an urgent decision was required and upon which he had been instructed to consult me. 2# The first point wae the question.of a site for the tanker anchorage. We discussed three sites, one in the open sea off the coafct near Magwa, the second at Ras al Ardh and the third at the easternmost end of Kuwait bay. The dis advantages of the first were obvious, and that at Ras al Ardh almost equally so, where the deep water close in could only provide a comparatively narrow berth. I said that subject to expert nautical opinion the site at the Kk? easternmost end of the harbour appeared the best^ and the soundings on the chart he shov/ed me showed that it was practicable and this apparently was the site the technical advisers favoured. I enquired whether an anchorage up the Khor Abdullah had been considered and he replied that it had not, though 1 do not think that he was speaking the truth# He mentioned that this would lead to a much longer pipe line, whereas the Ras al Ardh anchorage and that to the easternmost side of the bay were roughly an equal distance from the oil centres. t 3. He also told me in connection with these proposals that he had instructions to plan for a water pipe-line which would deliver two million gallons of fresh water a day to Kuwait. He thought that this amount was not excessive as it was roughly that nov; employed at Masj id-i-Sulaiman, but he con sidered that the intention probably was to give a portion, say a quarter, to the town, and a quarter for the possibility of sulphur production, and also to make a liberal allowance for possible expansion. 4. I advised Mr. Scott to be very careful in any approach to the Iraqis to make it quite clear that they were merely considering this as a possible . alternative to utilising a tanker service from the Shatt-al-Arab. If the Iraqis once gained the im pression that the Kuwait Oil Company were in any way bound to obtain this water from them they would be certain to take up a most intransigejint attitude. The amount of v/ater involved is one that would require a 10,000 ton^ tanker a day to move it. 5. I drew attention to the possibility of acquiring the existing water line from the Shatt-al-Arab to Shaiba, and suggested it might be advantageous to make use of their American components in these negotiations as the Iraqis would be more reluctantto 10 this and it is for consideration whether we should assist them by influencing the Jhaikh of Kuwait to object to the visits.

These plans included the development of tanker anchorages, pipe-lines for both oil and water, the construction of a refinery, and the development of the production of oil from the Burgan Oil Field. Also considered in the correspondence are the potential local repercussions, both positive and negative that such rapid development might have in Kuwait (also given as Koweit), some of the correspondence between the Company and the Shaikh is given in both English and Arabic. Also discussed is work undertaken by the Kuwait Oil Company for the British Army from 1942-1943 to provide Bitumen, and the Company's desire to use the leftover Bitumen to asphalt roads in Kuwait. Correspondence relating to the services provided by the Kuwait Landing Company, who are responsible for the loading and unloading of all cargo in Kuwait, is also included and discussion centres around the rights of the Kuwait Oil Company to unload their own cargo and their need of special steel barges to do so, which they acquire from Gray, Mackenzie and Company.Also recorded are visits made by representatives of both the Kuwait Oil Company, and its parent companies the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Company to Kuwait which were made to discuss operational matters, attempt to secure further concessions from the Shaikh, and to settle disputes amongst the staff there. Visits were also made by Major Frank Holmes, the London Representative of the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Kuwait Oil Company, and his Indian Interpreter, Ashraf Ali Shamsuddin.Other matters discussed include the Kuwait Oil Company's proposal to acquire a concession from the Shaikh of Kuwait (Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ) for an area outside Kuwait territorial waters, and the US Government's proclamation in 1946 which extended their jurisdiction to the subsoil adjacent to the American Coast on the Continental Shelf. Included in the volume are the minutes of a meeting held 16 January 1946 to discuss what the British Government's response to the proclamation should be. The outcomes of the meeting were to make a public statement supporting the American Government's proclamation and to commence an investigation into how the proclamation could be applied by the British Government, focusing particularly on the case of the Persian Gulf where the Continental Shelf was so shallow any rights would have to be shared by all adjacent states on an equitable basis, taking into account ownership of pearl fisheries too.Other matters of note within the volume are:Rumours that the American Oil Companies intend to construct a pipeline from the Mediterranean to Kuwait as part of their ongoing development of oil production in Saudi Arabia;The reactions against the proposal in the United States and conversations between the US and British Goverments over future worldwide oil expansion, focusing particularly on the Middle East and considering questions such as the quantities of oil to be produced, the challenges of transporting it, and matters such as concession rights and marketing policies;Ibn Saud's alleged attempts to influence the Shaikh of Kuwait in his choice of recipient of his share of the Neutral Zone Concession, specifically nominating the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company.A memorandum written by W S Gregor, General Manager for BAPCO at Busreh [Basra], regarding complaints about the handling of cargo in Bahrain and the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO)'s desire to make their own lighterage arrangements. The complaints related to the lack of experienced staff and supervisors at delivery points which was resulting in stowing, smuggling and pilfering.The correspondence in the file is primarily between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Kuwait, the Secretary of State for India, the Shaikh of Kuwait, the India Office, the Ministry of Fuel and Power, the Kuwait Oil Company and Major Frank Holmes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian Development Syndicate Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Division</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Frank Holmes</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum products</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00026e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
