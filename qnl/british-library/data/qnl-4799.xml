I an advised that the Ccoaonwealth Relations Office, London support your view that the rapid growth of Kuwait, due to oil development, makes the introduction of an air service there desirable, and that they are anxious to do whatever is possible to further this idea. So far as the carriage of air mail is concerned, it would cf course be ^referable for this to bo handled by a British Company employing British air crews, and beiore considering whether to accept your proposal that an air mail contract should be placed with Iraqi Airways, the C.R.O., have asked the Ministry of Civil Aviation whether it would not be possible in the near future to make Kuwait a calling place for aircraft of the B.O.A.C. service U.K.* Bahrain, The C.R.O. pointed out to the M .C.A. that (l) oil development at Kuwait was likely to be on a greater scale than at Bahrain and in c .'nsequence the linking of Auwait with a regular air service seemed most desirable. (2) it would give the Oil Company the greatly improved facilities for the movement of their personnel and (3) it would do a great deal to enhance British prestige at Kuwait and would be of the greatest assistance to the Political authorities in the Gulf. There is also the further point that it seems probable that an arrangement for regular calls cf B .o.A .C. aircraft at Kuwait would form a strong inducement to the Company to accept responsibility for the control and management of aerodromes there as the Agents of H.M.G, It is not unlikely that, if asked to do so, they would also co-operate fully in providing the facilities which would be required for the operation of flying boats in the Kuwait Bay, Y-u will no doubt be advised by C .Jx, 0, cf further develox^ments. In the meantime, G.P.0. London is also examining the position. (Sgd) W. Appleby. 14 November, 1947.Appendix &amp; , The Political Resident, Following upon ny recent preliminary discussions with the Pakistan postal authorities, ny insi^ection of the Bahrain and Kuwait Post Offices, and my discussions with you regarding the taking over by the British Post Office on the 1st of April, 1948 of the control of the postal, etc. services in the Persian Gulf, I think it well (i.e, before my departure from Bahrain) to set out below the position as I see it up-to-date, and the recommendations which, on the data available, I propose to make to my Headquarters as to the services to be provided. It will be seen that it is proposed to maintain existing services so far as practicable, but as you will readily appreciate, it will be necessary to alter the existing postage rates or charges in many insts.nces, as well as the conditions applicable to particular services, so as to fit in with the machinery of the British Post Office, One of the most important alterations will be the change-over from 'inland' to 'foreign' rates and conditions as regards postal matter posted in the Persian Gulf Agencies addressed to Pakistan and/or India, inasmuch as anything going overseas from the Gulf, even to Pakistan and/or India, will have to be treated as Imperial and Foreign matter under the British Post Office Act and the Postal Union Convention.

The system applies to both letters and parcels. It is proposed to adopt this system in the x,G, inland service. Under existing regulations, registration is obligatory for all parcels exceeding 440 tolas in weight, and for all parcels requiring Customs declarations, i,e, sent from one Agency to another. It is proposed to discontinue this practice, and following U,K, practice to make registration an optional service. The number of registered items exchanged between the Agencies is very small.

The No. or value-Payable (u.o.D.) parcels posted in the Gulf is very small-during one period of 4 mth. one such parcel only was in fact posted - and in the circumstances this facility may be discontinued. It is clearly undesirable to set up complicated machinery for a service for which there is no demand. parcelsParcels Existing postage rates for all countries overseas, except India and/or Pakistan to be maintained. Postage rates to India and/or Pakistan to be fixed later, i.e. after final discussions with Pakistan postal authorities. P.-D.D. Service (Payment of Customs charges by sender) No service This service is available in India and/or Pakistan, but there appears to have been no demand for such a service in the Persian Gulf. — — r — i AIR MAIL SERVICES The main effect of the change of control will be that communication with India and/or r-akistan will be international instead of internal « This means that the existing cheap air mail rates from the Persian Gulf to India and/or Pakistan will have to be increased. An economic rate covering the whole of India and/or Pakistan, and the use of Indian airservices, would be about 6 annas per half ounce (this is inclusive of, and not additional to, ordinary postage). It might however also be practicable to offer a separate air postage rate for letters addressed to Pakistan not. requiring internal air transmission within Pakistan, viz; 3i annas per half ounce. The latter rate would be extremely beneficial for air mail letters addressed only to Karachi. The air x^ostage rates to other countries v/ill be affected by reas of the fact that the Gulf ports are in a different financial zone from India for the purpose of air conveyance charges, and it seems likely that the rates to countries westwards can be reduced v/hile the rates for countries eastwards may have to be increased. For example, an air postage rate of 6 annas per half ounce could perhaps be justified for letters addressed to the United Kingdom (as compared with the existing rate of 12 annas per half ounce). Air mail rates for the Western Hemisphere generally might be at slightly less than those existing at present: possibly the sum of the rates from the Agencies to the United Kingdom, and from U.K. to destination, e.g. about IRs. per half ounce for letters for the U.S.A. An air letter form at 6 annas might be allowed to any country, including the Western Hemisphere. The whole question of the air postage rates is^ however, already under consideration by my Headquarters, and full details will be forwarded to you as scon as a decision has been reached. Proposed air mail service betv/een Kuwait and Basra The position is as explained in my report of the IVth of November. Savin .lis Dank Business The British Post office is not anxious, at any rate at the outset,, to provide facilities of this kind, but is prepared, if desired, to liquidate responsibility of the Indian Post &amp; Telegraph Department for Indian Savings .Bank Accounts and National Savings Certificates, During my preliminary discussions at Karachi, it was suggested informally, that the best solution would perhaps be for the inhabitants of the Gulf Agencies to be advised as early as possible that V (i)Q (i) the Indian Post &amp; Telegraph Department was giving up the control of the postal, etc, services in the Persian Gulf on the 31st of March, 1940, and that after that date the British Post Office would take over, and (ii) as a result those persons holding Indian Savings Dank Accounts, National Savings Certificates and other Government securities should take immediate action to close their accounts. Any applications for withdrawal received after the 31st of March, 1948 to be passed to the Pakistan postal authorities at Karachi for settlement. Thus the British Post Office would be relieved of any responsibility, I do not think that the withdrawal of these facilities wia.1 involve much hardship: savings could be paid -nstoad into the local banks. The question is however now receiving official consideration by the Pakistan authorities, and the final decision will be commonicated as soon as possible. Wireless Licences It appears that licences are not at present necessary for receiving sets, and that applications for transmitting licences, which are rare, are subject to the joint approval of the Shar.kh concerned and yourself, I understand that it is your view that this practice ouould be maintained, i,et applications for transmitting licences und for allocation of frequencies to be dealt with locally as they arise.

Postage Stamps(ii) postage Stamps British stamps overprinted 'BAHRAIN' and 'KUWAIT' respectively, and to bear the amounts in local currency, are being provided at the outset in the following denominations: A similar range of British stamps overprinted vdth anna values, but not •bearing the name of the territory, is being provided for use in Muscat, Dubai and, if necessary, at G-wadur. I have also recommended to my Headquarters the desirability of providing as early as possible overprinted stamps of the 1 Iftipee and 2 roipee denominations for use at all Agencies, and intend, furthermore, to recommend the provision of at least one higher value overprinted stamp, say for 5 or 10 rupees, to meet the postage on heavy air mail packets. At Bahrain . Cable and Wireless performs the collection and delivery of telegrams, and the local administration handles no telegraph traffic. At Kuwait , Cable and Wireless performs the collection and delivery and there is no inland telegraph system. The position in regard to the taking over of the Kuwait - Basra land- line was explained in my report of the 14th of November. I have not yet visited Muscat, Dubai or Gwadur, but I understand that at Muscat Cable and Wireless performs the collection and delivery of telegrams, and that there is no local telegraph administration. At Shar.jah and B.A.0.C, at present operate a wireless circuit with Cable and Wireless at Bahrain, Dubai , the commercial centre of this area, is some 10 miles from Sharjah, and our only information so far is that telegraph traffic betv/een the two places is conveyed by D.O.A.C. motor transport. There is little information of G-wadur . Traffic from this area reaches U.K. from the Indian Department at Karachi or Bombay, The British Post office is not anxious to assume control of the telegraph arrangements, and to take over only the Post office at G-wadur would be most uneconomical. The postal receipts average about Rs, 80/- a month. The British Post Office would much prefer therefore, subject to the consent of the Sultan of Muscat (which consent, with reservations, has, I understand now been obtained) that the Pakistan G-overnment should be asked to continue the existing postal and telegraph arrangements. As the volume of postal traffic between Muscat and Gwadur is probably very small the British Post office would have no reluctance, if the point is raised, to handling the traffic for the reduced inter-port postage rates under arrange ment with Pakistan, ' I understand, however, that (i) from a general political point of view you dislike the idea of postal and telegraphic matters at Gwadur being left in the hands of Pakistan. ^ d stamp 1 'd stamp 1^ d stamp 2 d stamp 2^ d stamp 3 d stamp 6 d stamp overprint 2 anna overprint 1 anna overprint l-g- annas overprint 2 annas overprint 2^ annas overprint 3 annas overprint 6 annas Telegraphs, etc GWADUR(i) (11) you ar.e of the opinion that the land line between Gwadur - ranjgur is in Dad condition, needs considerable repair, and is in any case likely soon to cease to function (iii) Your provisional view is that pressure should be put on Cable and Wireless to run a small wireles's station for communication with (a) India and Muscat or (b) Muscat only. In that event it might be possible to arrange for Cable and Wireless to run the Post Office as a sub-post office , of Muscat. It seems therefore that the future of Gwadur is dependent upon (1) the willingness of Cable and Wireless to open up a wireless station there and (2) if so, the length of time required to open it up. Even if willing to do so, provisional arrangements would have to be made for the running of the lost Office unless the wireless station was ready by the 1st of April, 194o. Although you dislike the idea of Pakistan carrying on with the postal and telegraphic business at Gwadur as a permanent measure, you might perhaps be prepared to ask them to continue the present arrangements until such time as a definite decision on the natter has been reached, STAFFING, Etc, It is understood that you propose to engage new staff, and, if possible locals, on contract terms, say for a period of 3 years. Those of the present employees who wish to carry on under His Majesty's Government, and who are now employed by the Indian/Pakistan Government on pensionable terms Mvill be advised to consider the question of terminating their service with the Indian/ Pakistan administration, taking such pension as they may be entitled to, and to enter into a contract, as mentioned above, for service under His Majesty's Government. In the meantime, present Indian/Pakistan staff to be retained, if they are willing, on deputation terms, British Postal Superintendent, It has been recommended to my Headquarters that the British Postal Superintendent should be posted to Bahrain as soon as possible in the New Year to give him an opportunity for inspecting the Post offices which will be under his control, the class of staff employed and their methods of working, I understand that rent free accommodation will be found for him. It seems desirable that accommodation should, if possible, be near the Post Office, and I gather that you are endeavouring to obtain such accommodation. It also seems desirable that the Postal Superintendent should have a personal clerk, if possible a shorthand typist and preferably an Indian, and it is understood that you will endeavour to engage such an officer. Payments of salaries, wap;es, etc. It is x-^roposed that the salary of the Postal Superintendent should be paid by you, as Political Resident, The actual amount to be paid each month, i,e, after deduction of British income tax, to be advised to you by the Accountant General's Department, G.P,0,, London, Wages of subordinate staff, rents for Post Office property etc, to be paid by the Postal Superintendent, OPEiuiTIuN OF POSTAL SERVICES The operation of the postal services to be a matter entirely for the new postal Superintendent, The latter will however be required to refer to you all questions of policy, and to consult you on any important matter. He may however seek your advice whenever he needs assistance, SUPERVISION OF POST OFFICE ACCOUNTS I understand that it is your desire that the general supervision of accounts for all postal Agencies should be undertaken by the Postal Superintendent, and that you will need to be furnished only with a statement say, each quarter, showing briefly the income and expenditure particulars of each of the Agencies, RENEWALRENEWAL OF LEASES FOR POST OFFICE PREMISES I understand that you will undertake this. PKuVISION OF FUNDS FOR POST OFFICES I understand that, subject to authority from His Majestyb Government you will undertake to provide the iostal Superintendent with funds f.or use in connection with the operation of the postal etc. services should this become necessary (which is unlikely). POST OFFICE STORES, STAMPS. ETC . All Post Office stores, except stamps or other valuable items, to be sent direct to the Postal Agency concerned. Stamps and other valuable items, to be sent to the Political Agent for the appropriate Agency for distribution to the postal Agency as and when required, POST OFFICE FURNITURE. EQUIPMENT. ETC . The question as to whether this should be taken over by His Majesty's Government and the price, to be considered in connexion with the general question of the handing over of political buildings in the Gulf from the Indian Government to His Majesty's Government. I shall be very glad to be advised whether you concur generally in the recommendations and remarks quoted above. (Sgd) W. Appleby, British Post uffice Representative 24th November, 1 47.0 Appendix H. CONFIDENTIAL PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY , DAHriAIN, D.O, No, 2014-S. the 25th November, 1947. Dear Appleby, I acknowledge with many thanks your note giving details of the recommendations which you propose to make to your headquarters regarding the postal services to be provided in the Gulf States, I concur generally in your recommendations and have only the following comments to make, 2, With regard to your remarks regarding wireless licences at page 5 the position is that the granting of licences for amateur wireless transmitting sets is contingent on the joint approval of the political Agent and the Shaikh after the local service authorities e,g, the ii,A.F. have been consulted. The Middle East Communications Board are then asked if they have any objection. If they have none the Gcvornment of India are asked to allot a call sign, I presume that when the G,x',C, have taken over they will deal with the allotment of call signs. The procedure described in this paragraph may be held to apply to all the Gulf States except Muscat though it has up to date only been followed in Bahrain and Sharjah as no application for a licence has been made in any other State, 3, With reference to the remarks regarding telegraphs at Kuwait on page 6 the collection and delivery of telegrams despatched and received over the Kuwait-Basra land line is I believe performed by the post office and not by Cable and Wireless, 4, With reference to your remarks about Gwadur at pages 6 and 7 I should be grateful if you could let me have a further note after you have visited the place, I would suggest that the present overland postal service should be abolished and that all mails should be despatched by D,I, steamers which call regularly in each direction once in six weeks. This should result in a considerable saving and the service should I think be sufficient for the needs of the place in view of the fact that telegraphic facilities are' available. 5, With reference to your remarks about staffing on page 7 the rakistan Government will have to be consulted about the further employment of the present staff and may have their own views on the subject, I will endeavour to obtain a personal clerk for the Postal Superintendent but am very doubtful if I shall be able to find a satisfactory shorthand typist, I should be grateful for early information regarding the date from which the clerk will be required, 6, I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the thoroughness with which you have examined our postal system here and of all the trouble you have taken in working out the arrangements for its transfer to His Majesty's Government, Yours sincerely, (Sgd) W,R, HAY, V/, Appleby, Esquire, BAHRAIN ♦LB 1Appendix I. To The Director-General, Posts &amp; Telegraphs (?ak,) KARACHI. Subject;- PERSI a N GULF POSTAL SEii VICES. ETC. . I have now visited the Post Offices at Bahrain, Kuwait, Dubai &amp; Muscat, and have had many discussions with Sir Rupert Hay, the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf, with the Political Agents for the territories concerned, ^ with Cable and Wireless rex)resentatives and with others directly intereste:. in the question of the taking over by the British Post Office on the 1st of April, 1948 of the Postal etc. services in the Gulf. As a result, and having regard to the further discussions with yourself and members oi your staff, I propose to report to my Headquarters on the lines indicated below:- It will be seen that it is proposed to maintain the present services s^. far as practicable but, as you will appreciate, it will be necessary to alter the existing postage rates or charges in many instances, as well as the conditions applicable to particular services, so as to fit in with the machinery of the British Post Office. One of the most important features will be the change-over from 'inland' to 'foreign' rates and conditions in regard to postal matter posted in the Persian Gull Agencies addressee t - Pakistan/India, inasmuch as anything going overseas from the Gull, ev^-n to Pakistan/India will have to be treated as Imperial and Foreign matter und^r the British post Office Act and the Postal Union Conventi n.

OBSERVATIONS The No. of V.P. Parcels posted in the G-ulf is very sraall-during a period of 4- months one such parcel only was posted' :nd in the circumstances it will remain for further consideration by my headquarters whether or not the service should be maintained. It is clearly undesirable to set up complicated machinery for a service for which there is no demand. It is proposed at the outset to maintain the existing postage rates for all countries over seas, except Pakistan/India. For Pakistan/India it is proposed that the rates should be - Up to 2 lbs. 1 r. 6 a II ' 3 ti 1 n 9 II u ' 7 »i 2 ii 9 ii It '11 it 3 II 12 ii tt '22 m 6 it 0 ii No service The rates for Pakistan/ India have been based on (a) Handling costs in Persian Gulf (b.) Sea costs and (c) Territorial credits due to Pakistan or India. The cost of (c) are 8 a,, 8 a, 1 rupee, 1 rupee 8 a., and 2 rupees 4 a. res pectively for 2,3»7,11 and 22 lbs, parcels, and the costs of (a) have been fixed provisionally at same amounts, although in fact actually less under present conditions. Sea costs (b) have been estimated at 6 a, 9 a, 9 a, 12 a, 1 r. 8 a, respectively. Any transit credits that may be due to Pakistan for parcels transiting that dominion for India, or due to India for parcels transiting that Dominion for Pakistan, have been ignored for the purpose of the assessment of postage rates - the British P.O. will bear any small loss arising in respect of such parcels. No demand sea mil contract As regards contract with B.I.S.N. Co., it is understood that the Indian r. &amp; T. Department will continue to pay for it, and that whatever mils are carried by these steamers, or any other steamers under contract with the Government of India, will have to be paid for at postal Union Convention rates. ^IR MAIL SERVICES . The main effect of the change of control will be that communication with Pakistan/India will be international instead of internal . This means that the existing cheap air mail rates from the Persian Gulf to Pakistan/India will have to be increased. An economic rate covering the whole of Pakistan/ India, and the use of Pakistan/Indian Air Services, would be about 6 annas perX^er half-ounce, (This is inclusive of, and not additional to ordinary postage,)- ^ight however be practicable to offer a separate air postage rate,'say, 3^ annas per half-ounce, for letters addressed to Pakistan not requiring internal air transmission within Pakistan, e .g., for letters addressed to Karachi, The air post^S 6 rates to other countries will be affected by reason of the fact that the Gulf ports are in a iifferent financial zone from India^ for the purpose of air conveyance charges, and it seems likely that the air postage rates to countries westwards can be reduced, while the rates for countries eastwards may have to be increased. For example, an air postage rate of 6 annas per half-ounce could perhaps be justilied f r letters addressed to the United Kingdom (as compared with the existing rate of 1 annas per half-ounce), Air Mail rates for the Western hemisphere generally might be at slightly less rates than those existing at present^: possibly the sum of the rates from the Agencies to the U.K. and from U.K. to destination. An air letter form at 6 annas might be allowed to any country, including the Western hemisphere. The whole question of the air postage rates is, however, already under consideration by my Headquarters, and full details will be forwarded to you as soon as a decision has been reached, REMITTANCE SERVICES , Money Orders (ordinary and Air Mail) . (1) Between U.K, &amp; Gulf Agencies, There appears to be little demand lor the service, and^it . is proposed to discontinue it.

H tt It O— ' ^2 ^2 ^ it ii H ^ ' 6 •• ' ' 6 ' A similar range of British stamps overprinted with anna values, but not bearing the name of the territory, is being provided for us^ in Muscat, Dubai and, if necessary, at G-wadur, I have also recommended to my'Headquarters the desirability of providing as early as possible overprinted stamps of higher denominations for use at all offices to meet the postage on parcels and heavy air mail packets. TELEGRAPHS . The position seems to be as follows BAHRAIN . Cable and Wireless performs the collection and delivery of telegrams, and the local postal administration handles no telegraph traffic. KUWAIT . The Pakistan/lndi-inposts &amp; Telegraphs Department maintain the telegraph line between Kuwait and Basra, I understand that thvj line is inadequate, in bad condition and requires complete renewal, and thr.t Gable and Wireless can dispose of the traffic from Kuwait by wireless to Bahrain and thence by cable to Fao and on to Basra, Even so, however, the latter cable is old and always liable to break and during the last few years has been more often down than up. The London G.P.O, Telecommunications Department has under consideration the question of developing radiotelephony in the Persian Gulf and amongst the proposals is telephony between Kuwait and Iraq f ..r which three alternatives are being considered. They are telephone landline, wireless telephony and telephone cable; and the Telecommunications Department has advised that they would prefer to await their final consideraoion cf the whole project before commenting on the question of taking over and maintenance of the existing Kuwait - Basra land lime. MUSCAT , Cable &amp; Wireless performs the collection and delivery of telegrams and there is no local telegraph administration, DUBAI . There are no telegraph facilities at Dubai. GWADUR. I was unable to visit this place, and there is little information available. Traffic from this area reaches U.K. from the Pakistan or Indian Department at Karachi or Bombay - but see below. SAVINGSSAVINGS BANK BUSINESS, ETC . The British Post Office is not anxious, at any rate at the outset, to provide facilities of this kind, but is prepared if desired to liquidate responsibility of the Indian Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department for Indian Savings Bank Accounts and National Savings Certificates. It is suggested that in the circumstances the best solution would be for the inhabitants of the Gulf Agencies to be advised as early as possible that - (i) the Indian P. &amp; T. Deptt. is giving up the contrcl of the postal etc. services in the Persian Gulf on the 31 s t of March 194G, and that after that date the British Post Office will take over; and (ii) as a result these persons holding Indian Savings Bank Accounts, National Savings Certificates and other Government securities should take immediate action to close their accounts. Any applications for withdrawal received aftur the 31st of March, 19^-S to be passed to the Pakistan Postal authorities at Karachi for settlement. Thus, the British Post Office vail be relieved from any responsibility. The withdrawal of these facilities should not involve much hardship; savings could be paid instead into the local oanks. / G V/ A D U R. The British post Office is not anxious to take .over any telegraph commitments, and to take over only the Post Office would be most uneconomical. The postal receipts average about Rs. 80/- a month. The Political Resident, Persian Gulf has expressed tho opinion that from a •■eneral political point of view it would be preferable for H .M. Government to take over postal and telegraph matters in Gwadur, -no. suggests that Cable and Wireless should be approached with the view of setting up a small wireless station there for communication with India and Muscat. In that event it might be possible also to arrange for the Company to run the Post Office as a Sub-Post Office of Muscat. I was not able to visit Gwadur and have been unable so far to get any figures of the relative telegraph traffic, but I understand that the present office does in fact pay its way. The port has very poor communication, ships rarely call, and mails are conveyed by camel a fortnight to Delhi via Quetta taking a minimum ~f 13 days in transmission. No air service is available. The existing telegraph line Gwadur-Panjgur appeals at present to be in bad condition, but it is very essential to the native population (about 10- , 12,000) for trading purposes - thoy deal mainly in the export of fish — and I am advised.that if the telegraph line is stopped it will strangle^trade and possibly result in the evacuation of the inhabitants to Karachi. The inhabitants have been pressing for a long time past for oetter communication facilities; and there is no doubt that there would be a great uproar if the present facilities were worsened. In the circumstances, the position will be communicated tu my Headquarters for a decision on the point. In the meantime, I understand that the Pakistan administration vail be prepared to continue the present postal and telegraph arrangements at Gwadur until such time as a decision has been reached. I understand also that so long as the Pakistan Administration run the postal &amp; telegraph services at Gwadur, you would prefer that no change should be made in the existing services, conditions and postage rates, i.e., that Gwadur should be regarded during this period as part of Pakistan for postal &amp; telegraph purposes. STAFFINGSTAFFING. The Political Resident will be responsible for engaging staff for the Post Offices in the Persian Gulf; and he has advised that he proposes to ungate new staff and, if possible locals on contract terns, say for a period three years. Those of the present employees who wish to carry on under Kis Majesty's Government and who are now employed by the Pakistan/India Government on pensionable terms will be advised to consider the question of terminating their service with the Pakistan/Indian administration, taking such pension as they may be entitled to, and to enter into a contract, as mentioned above, for service under His Majesty's Government, In the meantime,, present Pakistan/India staff will be retained as already agreed, if they are willing on deputation terms. I understand that the Political Hesi.ient will be communicating with you shortly on this subject, POST OFFICE STORES . As a result of the change over in control, British forms and documents will have to be printed in place of the present Pakistan/Indian forms, etc. Steps to t is end are being taken, but in view of the short time available, i fear that it may not be practicable to get some of the necessary new forms and documents printed and sent out to the offices concerned in time for the take over, I understand that while all existing stores on hand at the Agencies on the 1st of April may be taken over by the British Post Office if so desired, the Pakistan administration is reluctant to supply or to loan any further stores after that date because of the paper situation in Pakistan, I gather, however, that in the event of emergency the Pakistan administration will do its utmost to supply at the expense of the British i -st Office such forms as may be required, or otherwise endeavour to arrange for such forms to be printed in Pakistan, No guarantee on this point can, however, be given, POST OFFICE FURNITURE, EQUIrMENT, ETC . The question as to whether this should be taken over by His Majesty's Government, and the price, to be considered in connection with the general question of the handing over of political buildings in the Gulf from the Indian Government to His Majesty's Government. I wish to emphasize that the foregoing proposals in regard to services, rates, etc, should be regarded merely as recommendations which I shall make to .ny Headquarters where consideration will be given to the various points and the decisions communicated to you as early as possible. In the meantime, I shall be glad to be advised whether so far as concerns the Pakistan administration, you concur generally in the recommendations and remarks quoted above. The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, has seen the recommendations and has in general agreed, with them - vide letter annexed the return of which will be appreciated, I should like to add that I am greatly indebted to all members of your staff for the assistance they have readily given me in connection with my enquiries, K,S. Abdul Hamid, the Officer deputed to accompany me to the Persian Gulf ports was very helpful indeed with his knowledge of postal matters generally, and I very much appreciated his efforts (and those of his bearer) to make the tour as comfortable as possible, for me. He was in addition a most pleasant and entertaining companion and was well liked by all those with whom we come into contact. (Sgd) W.
