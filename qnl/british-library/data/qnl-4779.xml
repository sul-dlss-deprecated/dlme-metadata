In the absence of such steps British and Allied cargo 1 or Persia as vfeil as neutral cargo is likely to continue to be diverted to Indian ports until * orsi mi ^orte are again open for civil cargo. Do ^ou see any objection to this, because of possible congestion at Indian ports? if so please specify so far as possible what categories of goods should be stopped at source. It is in general desirable that goods from distont sources should continue to come forward as far as India so that they may be readily available when Persian ports are again open. &amp;8th ugust, 1941. oaCEKT-N i UNDER G ft iAl-ilotted to E, &amp; 0, Dept , FOR INDIA.

With reference to paragraph 5 of my telegram of the 6th August No. 9259 it has 'been decided not to proceed with the idea of offering some financial inducement to the Shah. There is, however, a suggestion that it may he desirable at a later stage, e.g. possibly, should military measures be necessary, to influence the Iranian public by a pronouncement, as was done in Syria, to the effect that His Majesty’s Government are willing to do what they can to ensure that the population is provided with its requirements of sugar, tea and piece goods. Bullard has also suggested that jute and cement should be included, but these are not regarded as so important since they are unlikely to impress the Iranian public. 2. In case some pronouncement of the kind indicated should become desirable, His Majesty’s Government would be glad to know to what extent following rough estimates by His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, of Iran’s requirements for one year could be met from India:- (a) Tea - 5,000 tons. In this connection your telegram No. 2576 of 30th May is under consideration. Presumably there would be no supply difficulty even in regard to Iran's normal imports of about 7,000 tons. (b) Sugar - 55,000 tons. Presumably even Iran’s normal imports of up to 90,000 tons could be obtained from Java, or if present price difficulty was overcome, from India. (c) Cotton piece-goods - 50,000 bales. Stocks in Iran are said to be exhausted. In this connection please see my telegram to Commerce Department No. 9504 of 11th August. (d) Cement - 100,000 tons.
