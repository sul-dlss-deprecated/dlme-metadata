So our contribution to the Empire’s War Effort must be mainly financial. There has already been a generous response to appeals for War Charities and many have been buying Defence Bonds and War Certificates* but now we have reached ^ P^Tnt when it is up to each one of us to save every penny he can for the use of the Empire and for the swelling of the Empire’s War Charities. Most of us of course have to look to the future and for that reason I suggest that a fair distribution of savings would /-&gt;t~r- M I/- - 2 - *ouX&lt;5 be 'to invest two-thirds or three-quarters in War Bonds and Certificates every month and give the balance to Charity. And in deciding how much each person can contribute it should not be forgotten that we here have no income tax to pay ? no vast excise duties to meet, no rates and only a very small Customs duty* I am not going to suggest that Bahrain is an Ideal place to live in but at least we do not have black-outs and all the trials that people at Home must face in these days. So, we in Bahrain ought to produce contributions averaging very much higher than in most parts of the Empire. As for War Investments, residents of Awali can obtain all information about Savings Groups, War Bonds and Certificates from the Company ? s Notice Boards, while Manama people should consult the Manager of the Eastern Bank. For Charities I most earnestly recommend a monthly contribution. Periodic entertain ments in aid of Charity are admirable in many ways and often very productive, but it is the steady monthly contribution that really swells the Funds. For Awali residents it has been arranged that the Company will undertake to deduct subscriptions from ealaries monthly on receipt of authorisations in the form attached and to forward them to the Manager of the Eastern Bank who has very kindly undertaken to act as local Treasurer for the various Funds. For Manama residents a Banker's Order is attached which •hould also be filled in and sent to Mr. Gunn. It will be seen that the choice of one or more of several Charities is suggested.J. ^ Q I do hope that every one will combine in responding to this appeal to the utmost of his ability« The need is urgent and imnerative and no subject of the British Empire can ignore it without damage to his honour,, Yours sincerely.To BANKER*S ORDER The Manager, Eastern Bank, Bahrain, Please credit the War Charity/Charities narked in the list below with a sum/sums of monthly and debit my account.

H.Weightman Esq., The Agency, Bahrein. Dear Sir, Herewith the subscription list for the Overseas League Tobacco Fund, also the auditor’s report as well as the receipt from the Eastern Bank. From these you will see that a sum of il00.15.0 has been telegraphed to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London for payment to the Tobacco Fund. It occurs to me that you may wish to communicate with sponsors of this fund hence the enclosures. I am Yours Respectfully, Ends:' (14) Dated the ath July liHO. I am writing to you as a Manama resident to say that I should be roost grateful if you could find an opportunity to read tnis letter at some forthcoming meeting of the Awali War Charities Committee, of which I see you are a member. 2 . I have been somewnat distressed by the lack of response to my appeal for monthly contributions to War Charities, and I feel that this roay be due to misunderstanding which the members of your Committee could do much to remove. Various stories have reached me - that I expect people to give one-third of tneir income to Charity, that contributions of less than A 50/- a month would not bo welcome, and so on. Nothing could be further from the truth, and I find nothing in my circular letter to account for tnese misapprehensions, unless possibly some people have misunderstood my suggestions for War Savings - a very different matter. 3. I had hoped that every British wage-earner would be prepared and able to set aside about £ 1 /- a month as a regular contribution to Charity. If everyone did so, the net result in ten months would be almost exactly double the total sum collected in Bahrain in tne first ten months of war. Few people would, I think, miss « 13/8 a month and such a sum would scarcely be likely to affect the efforts which your Committee are making. The great advantage of a monthly con tribution is tnat it costs absolutely nothing to collect and involves the minimum effort on the part of two people only, Viz.,/- J G. W. H. Smith, Bsq., Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., ltd., Bahrain.I- 2 - viz., the Company^ cashier and the Manager of the Bank. 4. I am far from believing that the community as a whoie should not at the same time combine Charity with entertainment, and I do not doubt tnat your Committee wiii deal very adequately s with this side of the question. But I do wish to solicit the f goodwill and aia of ail your members in supporting and promoting tne monthly contribution idea - by explaining to people whom they meet every day now very simple ana mild that proposal 5. If there are any points in this connexion which your Committee would wish to discuss with me I shall be only too pleased to meet them at any time. And finally I would { sk you to be good enough to assure the Committee how grateful I should be for their co-operation.

The Honorary Secretary, Bahrein Island Community, Persian Gulf. Dear Sir, At this time of the year we usually appeal to our very many friends and helpers all over the world to help us to feed our very large family of 8,250 children - the Largest Family in the World. I am writing to you to ask if you can in any way assist us to over come the many difficulties which confront us due to the War. The feeding, clothing and training of 8,250 children is no mean task in normal times, but at the present time this burden has been increased by higher prices, the tax on many of our purchases and the cost of renting and equipping houses in country districts, whilst increased taxation has compelled many of our regular subscribers to decrease their gifts. During 1940 we admitted no less than 1,901 children, some of whom have lost one parent in an air-raid and a number who have had their homes destroyed. Dr. Barnardo’s Homes have been rescuing destitute children since 1866 - the total number of children admitted since that time is no less than 127,000 and our Charter is 'No Destitute Child Ever Refused Admission.' Our object is to train our children to become Christian men and women and self-supporting citizens of our great Empire. Any help you can give us will be thankfully received. ^ Yours trul y» ^ Secretary. pr.fr • General Secretary</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001fc_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1773</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001fc</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1773</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 36 War Charities'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1940/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-04-22T10:15:03</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (23 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 23; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
