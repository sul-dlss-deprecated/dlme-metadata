Section 1. [E 6077/16/91] No. 1. f Z , b 63^53 Final Record of a Meeting held at the Foreign Office on October 5 to discuss Relations between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. G. W. Rendel {in the Chair), Foreign Office. Mr. K. R. Johnstone, Foreign Office. Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty's Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. J. G. Laithwaite, India Office. The meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan's note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). Mr. Rendel outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty's Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity, and that it must there fore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy of His Majesty's Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was possible, to maintain their present treaty relationship with the Sheikh. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty's Government than it had been at any time, since it had bulked so prominently as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway before the war. This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia, which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air stand point as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and, secondly, owing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty's Government with that country. So long as Iraq had been under British control, there had been a natural tendency to give it prior consideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively in the background. But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance. Geographically, Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one from which the Gulf could be controlled. In the event of war we could probably safely assume that Koweit would be on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value, to the use of which, on the assumption in question, no objection could be raised on the ground that we were violating her neutrality. Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the East, Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that route, especially if our relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes of that route. Colonel Fowle suggested that in point of fact it might one day be possible to avoid ^tfte'use of Iraq altogether, and fly direct from Palestine to Koweit, as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route increased. Mr. Rendel concurred with Mr. Laithwaite's estimate of the position as regards Iraq. In view of recent events in Iraq it was possible that our whole relationship with that country might have to be modified, and he considered that both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and of the position of the Royal Air Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful. On the general point at issue, he [935 1—1] At. J- ftobserved that one of the main points to be borne in mina was the fact that Koweit was not naturally independent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It was a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed, and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It was for consideration, therefore, whether it would, in fact, be practicable for His Majesty's Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty's Government. Colonel Fowle concurred generally in Mr. Rendel's description of the economic position of the sheikhdom. He pointed out, however, that Koweit had always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrein was the port of Central Arabia. In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit's fresh water supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit over, for instance, the question of smuggling. Mr. Rendel agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to increase, unless, of course, Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak, and Sir Andrew Ryan's note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Saud could exert. The question, therefore, was whether His Majesty's Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had, in fact, been suggested that it might be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance, the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate, but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Koweit. Would not a protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Laithwaite drew attention to three points :— (a) (6) At present the obligations of His Majesty's Government to Koweit were represented by their undertaking to grant 'good offices ' in respect of Koweit under the 1899 agreement, by their promise of 1907 that 'the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him,' and their undertaking of the 3rd November, 1914, that Koweit, in the event of a victory over the Turks, would be recognised by us as an independent princi pality under British protection. They were thus very general in terms, and, in accordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations, save as regards good offices to Koweit town and the immediately adjoining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This was to some extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. With regard to the suggested establishment of a protectorate it was necessary to consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, and also what effect the proclamation of a protectorate might have on the o er Arab rulers of the Gulf. It would in any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature, since both in Bahrein n m Qatar and along the Trucial Coast it 'would probably rouseapprehensions and might even cause the local sheikhs to turn away from His Majesty's Government and consider submitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn Saud. (c) The basis of His Majesty's Government's present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place, it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of formal treaties with the Sheikh dating back for over a century, or, as in the case of Qatar, on a comprehensive treaty, but was based only on a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the sheikhs and His Majesty's Government since 1899 and on the reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered into in connexion with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1907; secondly, there were certain gaps, e.g., we had no slavery agreement with Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in that way. An example was our recent request to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrate effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty's Government. Another instance was the recent proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council so as to place responsibility for jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty's Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. Colonel Fowle exp ressed the view that there did not seem to be any inter mediate position possible 'between a treaty relationship with the Sheikh! on the present lines and a full protectorate. The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and, 'prima facie, he (Colonel Fowle) was not much in favour of it. He agreed, however, that it would be advisable, on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weakness of our treaty position, % replied that our difficulties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our normal control over 'the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Government;, to telTthe Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovern- ment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit, we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-a-vis of the foreign Power concerned. Mr. Laithwaite s&amp;idi that on this point he thought that Bahrein might be regarded as locus classicus. We had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last, in our view, became intolerable, we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. There were obvious arguments for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch, it would be most difficult for us to justify a refusal to allow foreign Governments which might be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. He did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Saud and Koweit. [935 1-1] B 24 Sir Andrew Ryan stated that he had been impressed by the apparen weakness of His Majesty's Government's position vis-a-vis of Ibn baud wi regard to Koweit. His Majesty's Government were not strongly placed when it became necessary to warn Ibn Sand to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintaining that Koweit was technically an independent btate. A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory, reierred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. Colonel Fowle pointed out that, in fact, our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Saud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government. Speaking generally, he added that, m fact, little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit, so long as it remained a Bedouin town ruled by a Bedouin sheikh, and not, like Bahrein, a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If, however, oil were discovered within the sheikhdom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly. If Iraq were to adopt an anti-foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there. We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit. We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty's Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control. Mr. Laithwaite agreed, and added that, in his view, our policy should be directed towards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declaration of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrein and of the Trucial Coast, and do more harm than good. The policy to be followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the sheikhdom. Reverting to the question of Saudi-Koweiti relations, Sir Andrew Ryan drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty's Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. This, no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Koweit, and the correspondence in question was of such long standing that it was difficult now for us to take the line that Ibn Saud should write to us rather than to the Sheikh. What was desirable was that we should be able to tell Ibn Saud openly that we were responsible for defending the Sheikh's interests in any given dispute. Mr. Laithwaite said that the explanation of the system of direct correspon dence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud was, he thought, that it dated from a time when the latter was not so important a ruler as he had since become, and when we had taken the view that it was unnecessary to take too strict a view of correspondence between sheikh and sheikh. That position was now changed, and reconsideration seemed desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that His Majesty's Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the Sheikh had undertaken certain obligations towards us. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and to emphasise our own special position in Koweit vis-a-vis of Ibn Saud more definitely than had been the case while Iraq was still under British control He suggested that we might {a) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be presuming too far with regard to Koweit a policy which we were, in fact, now prepared to follow in regard to the Saudi-Koweit blockade; and ib) enforce stricter regulations on the Sheikh in the matter of direct correspondence. Colonel agreed. Such action would show both the Sheikh and Ibn Saud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction. If we did not take some such step as this, we might be in danger of finding ourselves faced with the results of a kind of conspiracy between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud We ought therefore, to write to th- Sheikh in the sense that we noted that his private€orrespondence with Ibn Saud had assumed an increasing importance, and tell him that that correspondence must now cease. Mr. Rendel concurred. A straightforward control of this nature would be easier to maintain, and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter in which Ibn Saud had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his connexion with His Majesty's Government. Sir A. Ryan also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ibn Saud was spreading the idea that he might naturally absorb Koweit and was bound to do so sooner or later. He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty's Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit. The meeting then discussed what point in the correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud could most suitably be taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to both parties. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose, what action could be taken if the United States Government, in dealing with whom His Majesty's Government had consistently emphasised the Sheikh's independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone 1 It was, however, agreed that His Majesty's Government could demonstrate from the Sheikh's treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant without our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Saud would be Ibn Saud's letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty's Government. At the conclusion of the meeting Sir A. Ryan raised the question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arabia, or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty's Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question, therefore, was what real force there was in Ibn Saud's suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. Colonel Fowle suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh's proposal that Ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti-Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even if Ibn Saud were to develop Ras Tanura, possibly with American help, this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a different hinter land, nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras Tanura area which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit. Colonel Fowle suggested that on his return to the Gulf on the 16th October he should discuss the situation with Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, Koweit, who had great experience of the sheikhdom, in the light of the conversations at the present meeting, and should submit a comprehensive report. It was agreed that this course should be adopted, and that in the light of the Resident's report and of the conclusions of the present meeting the question of future policy in Koweit should be discussed if necessary in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee. The conclusions of the meeting were as follows :— (1) That in dealing with Ibn Saud, His Majesty's Government should increasingly emphasise the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh. (2) That the Sheikh should be told that his personal correspondence with Ibn Saud on official matters was to cease. (3) That the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with Ibn Saud by His Majesty's Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit.V; n (4) That on receipt of the despatch promised by Colonel Fowle the whole question of relations between His Majesty's Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle East Official Sub-Committee, to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the argu ments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorate. Appendix A. Note hy Sir Andrew Ryan. Ihn Saud's Attitude towards Koweit. I HAVE been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it ^ may be a definite object of Ibn Baud's policy to reduce Koweit to^ * pos'tion of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asir from 1926 to 1930. Inis is in the nature of a pure speculation, but it is a speculation so interesting tna think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it it must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea m his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty s Govern ment. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained m article o of the Treaty of Jedda, but he understands very well the implications ot the words therein 'who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty s Govern ment.' On the other hand, he has seen His Majesty's Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh oi Koweit lie might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the bheikli confronted them with the fait accom'pli of a political deal. ^ , 2. Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh's visit to Riadh m 1932 the secret messages brought by Ibn Saud's confidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year, and the Sheikh's mysterious dashes intoNejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high baudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. a 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud s attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's Government should not concern themselves with affairs between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. I class them as minor, because this position has never been categorically asserted. The first was when, in reply to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Koweit territory, which had perturbed His Majesty's Government, the reply was in effect: 'Sorry you have been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had been pursued through An. Nafisi.' On another occasion Fuad Bey, in rather light conversa tion, asked me why we concerned ourselves in matters between his Government and Koweit. , • n o 4. The personal relations between the two rulers are peculiar. Ibn baud grew up at Koweit, and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is said by others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that Mubarak treated Ibn Saud very badly. Anyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendship, however flimsy and however frayed by / * frequent friction over raids, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Saud from enforcing the embargo on trade, but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikh's ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Saud. They are 'Arcades ambo,' as I once wrote, and they both combine some real friendship for His Majesty's Government and a healthy fear of them with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. 5. The point of my theory or speculation is that, if the Sheikh of Koweit were at all willing to be 'Asirised,' Ibn Saud could make the proposal quite attractive on the following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use ;— {a) 'You are not really independent, my dear fellow. You are under the thumb of the English. They might annex you at any moment, or even present you to Iraq. If you must be dependent on some one, whybe dependent on those untrustwortliy imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia ? (b) 'I don't like squeezing you, I really don't, with that embargo. As things are at present, I have to think of my own interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily have an understanding. A sort of ' Zollverein' as they say; same duties levied in our ports; free competition between yours and mine; free trade over our land border. What have the English done about it ? Nothing; because they cannot get at me. ' Sois mon frere et je te fais vivre. Sois le leur et je te tue.' (c) 'I should not mop you up, of course. You would rule your State under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such a mess that he asked me to in 1930. I did not hit him on the head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck from me. (d) 'You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. What has England been able or even willing to do for you ? If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you would find that / knew how to see you through. (e) ' Then there's oil. People are after it in my country, and in yours, and in the Neutral Zone. Why not have an agreed policy and present a common front to the West ? You know what the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is. Another name for the British Government, as we saw in Persia the other day, even if we had not known it before. Take my tip and keep them out at all costs. Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don't trust him, and remember that in the long run your best policy would be to deal, like me, direct with American interests, using the others to put up the price.' 6. It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address. I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be, but many an Arab, not well pleased with. British protectors, might find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Saud's parlour. 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration. They may, however, be worthy of some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country, and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation. Except that Ibn Sand continues to show a marked anxiety to avoid all compli cations, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working theory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments. August 16, 1933. Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. By the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, His Majesty s Government formally assured the Sheikh ' of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successors Appendix B. Note. (A)— Nature of the Undertakings given.8 V scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond, under w ic the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agen or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government, and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage, 01 give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory ^_kh e Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent 01 xiis Majesty's Government. 2. By article 9 of the Secret Agreement of the 15th October, 1907, tor the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was ' duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise, and do hereby promise, that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mobarak's arrangements in the matter of customs, &amp;c., and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and . . . In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy ) customs dues in excess of 4 per cent, on goods imported or exported by '' the subjects of the aforesaid English Government,' save with the approval of that Government. 3. The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, contained an assurance that ' Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' (B)— Construction of the Undertakings given to the Sheikh. 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty's Govern ment with the Sheikh are in rather general terms, and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Majesty's Government. 5. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit, the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State's telegram No. 45 of the 4th December, 1901) that this 'appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan's promise' (to respect the status quo), ' and in these circumstances His Majesty's Government ^ are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us.' The assurance given is clearly limited by the words ' in these circumstances ' to this particular case. More over, it is not conditional on, and is independent of the Sheikh's observance of his agreement of 1899. 6. On the 21st March, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a memorandum on the situation in Koweit, remarked that our obligations toward the Sheikh were '' as ill-defined as the boundaries of his principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British 'protection'; on the other hand, we once made him a present of £1,000, and promised him our c good offices,' whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing, and not of Boobyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another We might, it seems to me, explain (1) to the 0 Porte; (2) to the Sheikh; and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested S k the objects of our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name, and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district ' 7. Later, in 1902, it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Saud, then the Sheikh of Koweit's friend, and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the Sheikh informed us that Ibn Saud had with him a gun presented by the Turks, and asked for a gift of two or three guns, which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against land attack. The Viceroy (telegram No. 39 of the 3rd October 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh's request could not be granted, C£ but that, provided he complied with the injunction conveved to him in pursuance of your telegram of the 4th December, 1901 (see paragraph 5 above). His Majesty'sGovernment would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.' The secretary of State, after consultation with the Foreign Office (Foreign Office ^ cto ^ er ' 1^02), replied (telegram No. 133 of the 14th October, 1902) : 'I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name. This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc y and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary oi btate for India of the Government of India whether the definition in question or Koweit territory had been communicated to the Sheikh, they replied that it might be assumed that it had, but that it ' only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ibn Rashid, who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit (telegram of the 6th April, 1911). Th j m0re s P® cific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease ot 1907, and quoted in paragraph 2 above, may be regarded as to some extent committing us in respect of ''the town of Koweit and its boundaries.' The phrase ' its boundaries'' is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the immediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911, and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. 9. In 1911, in connexion with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne's memorandum of 1902, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to 'define the region to which our obligation extends, and whether they accepted' general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, p. 1059, &amp;c., replied: 'We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh's territory; (2) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracv bv Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion. ...' 10. The Secretary of State for India, in the light of the Government of India's views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (the 8th April, 1911) ' Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21st March, 1902, is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by his Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbour hood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India's telegram of the 6th April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol. II, pp. 1059-1061, of Lorimer s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession. In this Lord Morley concurs; that is to say, he thinks that, in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits. His Majesty's Government could not abstain from using their 'good offices' in the Sheikh's favour. But the term 'good offices ' is a very vague one, which His Majesty's Government are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness, according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, however, in his Lordship's opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions, and could not fail to affect unfavourably our prestige in the Persian Gulf. ...' 11. The Foreign Office replied, on the 9th May, 1911, that Sir E. Grey concurred ' in the view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh, as described in the passage of Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which vour letter refers.' 12. In August 1911 the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P. Cox), recommended that His Majesty's Government should communicate to the Turks a copy of the agreement of 1899, with a note that His Majesty's Government had subsequently informed the Sheikh that, so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against [935 1 1] c10 attack by land or sea. The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 30th October, 1911, remarked :— ' The telegrams of the 4th December, 1901, and the 14th October, 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe's opinion, clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh's territory, as described in Lorimer's Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of the 8th April last, the term c good offices ' (which, by Colonel Meade's letter of the 23rd January, 1899, we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty's Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. ' His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run : ' As regards No. 1, His Majesty's Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement. His Majesty's Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,' with, perhaps, the addition that His Majesty's Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.' The Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter dated the 1st November, 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition, and a communication in this sense was made to Tevfik Pasha in Sir Edward Grey's letter of the 24th October, 1911. 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit 'shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection,' may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole. 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed, in March 1916, on his accession, by the Viceroy, that, ' so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government, you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.' A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir's death in 1917 to his brother and successor. Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. Sheikh Salim's conduct was unsatisfactory, and it was found necessary to warn plough the Political Resident, on the 5th July, 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of the 3rd November, 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts contrary to the interests of His Majesty's Government unfortunatelv be committed m future,' he would be held personally responsible. 15. In connexion with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928 the question of the precise extent of the obligations of His Majesty's Government for the defence of Koweit was considered in the India Office, when the view was put forward that consideration of our engagements suggested that, on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole. The history _ of the 1928 discussion is, however, examined in greater detail in Appendix C, to the conclusions of which attention is invited. Conclusion. 16. As will be seen from the correspondence summarised above (a) we appear consistently to have taken the view that our obligations are cond tioiTl on the good behaviour of the Sheikh - (b) secondlv fW ± conditional we are committed to ' good offices ' in respect of ' Kowpit ' reservation, has sinop 1^11 Wn Q nr^fJi respect ot Koweit, an assurance which ^ -i f j , ' t • ? accepted as extending to the whole territnrv r»f th* sheikhdom, but which would not commit ns tn amH-Ki™ f , tl } e surmort • A thirdlv tW tLT* oommit us to anything further than diplomatic support, [c) tnirdly that we have promised that the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to the heirs of Sheikh Mobarak (while the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh site was terminated in 1907, the agreeS of 1907 was not abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges embodied n that ag^ment should11 apparently still be regarded as binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments. We communicated article 9 of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Saud in 1928; and in 1933 the Political Agent, Koweit, and the Political Resident brought to notice the continued existence of the obligations of the Sheikh in regard to customs duties (paragraph 2 above) under article 10 of the agreement); {d) fourthly, that we have undertaken to recognise, and have in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of British protection '' in this connexion; and, while frima facie the Sheikh would apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors. J. G. LAITHWAITE India Office, October 11, 1933. Appendix C. S upplementary N ote. Question of Liabilitii for the Protection of Koweit aqainst Aqqression from Outside, 1928-29. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925, but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the principality. At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty's Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty's Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on the 27th January, 1928, and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again success fully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty's Government under existing engagements for the 'protection of Koweit' (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive) was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty's Government and the Government of India agreed that his Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars. 2. On the 15th August, 1928, the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, in order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air recon naissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air base at Koweit in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of the 22nd August, 1928) : ' The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds to the use of Koweit territory in connexion with air operations against the Akhwan, by which Koweit was not directly or immediately threatened. Having regard, however, to the treaty liability of His Majesty's Government for the protection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the Sheikh in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced, on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from theResident .... so far as may be practicable, on each specific occasion, and subject to the further restriction that there shall be no question of establishing a 'permanent base in Koweit territory.' As the result of considerable further interdepartmental discussion, the Air Officer Commanding was authorised on the 25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional reconnaissances over Koweit territory, both by air and car. ' His Majesty's Government are anxious, however, that— (1) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible, and (2) That the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsi bility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by His Majesty's Government, or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Air Officer Commanding in acting under the authority now given him.' (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 306, dated the 25th September, 1928.) 3. Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh, of armoured cars in Koweit '' for protection of Iraqi tribes for so long a period as one month.' (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 76, dated the 23rd February, 1929.) 4. In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of Koweit in the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Saud in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur in the use, if necessary, of military force, the nature and extent of which should be determined by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, for the purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any part of Koweit territory. On the 8th May, 1929, the India Office, in a letter to the Colonial Office, remarked: 'Viscount Peel gathers that the attitude of the Sheikh is no longer in question and that he has already promised to endeavour to prevent refugees making use of Koweit territory. As regards the question of giving the Sheikh military assistance for this purpose, the Secretary of State remains of his previous opinion that it is undesirable to extend in any way the general liability hitherto accepted by His Majesty's Government for the defence of Koweit territory, if this can at all be avoided It would, on the whole, be preferable, if possible, to avoid asking the Sheikh to concur in the use of military force, but if ... . such a request is still essential, he is prepared to agree that the Sheikh should be asked to concur ' The other Departments regarded it as essential to make a request in the sense referred to of the Sheikh and the necessary instructions were sent to the High Commissioner on the 11th May 5. The view held as regards our liability for protection of Koweit during the operations of 1928-29 is perhaps best stated in the India Office letters of the Au £ ust ' and the 8th May, 1929, quoted in paragraphs 2 and 4 above Wliile our precise liability for protection was not investigated in any great detail, the course of action adopted in dealing with threats to Koweit territory appears to have been generally consistent with the construction of our liability the ^25th Oct^^ 111 paragraph 10 of Busllire despatch No. 1365-S of India Office, February 6, 1934.

I discussed the matter with the Political Agent, Kuwait, when I passed through there recently on my way to Bushire. below in paragrajhs 7 and 8) discusred at the meeting was briefly whether, vith a view to maintaining our control over Kuwait, which was undoubtedly fast increasing in importance as a political and strategical centre in the Middle East, (a) it was advisable to declare a British protectorate over that ShaiKhdom, or (b) whether sufficient control could not be obtained over it by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the ShaiJdi as opportunity offered by filling in the gaps which at present existed in our agree- merit s ^ith him# favoured (b) rather than (a), and further reflection and my discussion with Colonel Bickson, who agrees with me, has One of the two questions (the other is dealt with As will be seen from the record, ■prima facie I confirmed/ His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, The India Office, LOHDOH.4./ cor?firmed we in that opinion. The ohjeotioms to (a) are that, in our - (i.e# Colonel Dickeon and my), opinion a protectorate would moet prohahl^ Hieet -with considerable opposition from the Shailch, -who while valuing his British connection Talues eriually highly his independence in the eyes of his fellow Arah rulers, and the dtside world in general. The declaration of such a protectorate would likewise alarm the other Shaikhs on the Arab Coast of the Qulf. It might also involve His Majesty's Government in a measure of Interference in the internal affairs of Kuwait which can at present 'be avoided. The question of slavery in Kuwait, for example, as -oart of the Slavery question in the Gulf generally, will doubtless be raised in the future by the recently established Permanent Slavery Committee of the League of Nations, and as we have no Slave Agreement with the ^uler, such as exists with the other Arab rulers by which the local ^litical Agent can manumit slaves, the Kuwait aspect of this problem offers special difficulties. So long as TTuwait remains * independent* His Majesty^ Government's responsibility in the matter is presumably limited to representations and persuasions to the Shaikh. In the event, however, of a British protectorate being declared over the Shaikhdom, His Majesty's Government might possibly be committed to more drastic action. Hnally it is not improbable, though this is a matter outside my sphere, that the declaration of a Kuwait protectorate might lead to somewhat awkward accusations from other governments of 'land grabbing' and the like, with which we have been familiar enough in the past with regard to other areas.An examination of the alternative policy ('b) shows that, unsatisfactory as our present treaty relation ship with the Shaikh may be, (as was pointed out at the meeting), we have a certain control over the Huler^ (see India Office Note - Obligations of Hie Majesty's Government towards the Shaikh of Kuwait)&gt; and wherfc our Agreements show gaps, these can to a large extent he filled up. Thus control of aviation through Kuwait, whether military or civil, would he in the hands of His Majesty's Government under the proposed Air Agreement (vide correspondence ending with India Office letter No.iP.Z•4434/33, dated the 11th August 1933, to the Government of India, l^breign and Political Department) with the Shaikh, while the proposed amendment of the Kuwait Order in Council (vide correspond ence ending with Government of India, Foreign and I^litical Department Express letter No.P.364-N/33, dated the 21st August 1933, to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India) would place jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in Kuwait in the hands of the Political Agent. &amp; ^hird 'gap 1 is the habit of direct corresiDond- enoe which has grown up between the Shaikh and Itn Saud, and whldi was dealt with at some length at the neetlng. The outccme of my discussion with Colonel Dickson on this point Is as follows. There would appear to fee two ways In which we can ensure control over this correspondence. (l) By informing the Shaikh that before despatch ing any official coimrani cation to Ihn Saud he should show it to the Political Agent, and should take similar action with communications received from Ibn Saud. This has been the Shaikh's oustow in the past, at any rate in regard to his/-4- his outward correspondence; whether he has shown ali Baud's official letters to Colonel Tickson we do not, of course, know* After the Hhaikh had received our communica tion, which would, of course, be tactfully worded and would merely ask him to continue the practice which he already observed, he would not 'be able to quote officially any letters which he had not shown to the Political Agent. If for Inatanoe, In order to prssent His Majesty's GoirerniBent with a fait accomuli on some point agreed upon between Ibn Baud and himself t he shomld produce a co*®iunicatlon which had not been seen by the ? olitical Agent, we coul^T ignore it. Both Colonel 1&gt;ickson and I think that perhaps it would be better in our coBirsunication not to refer to any particular correspondence but to treat the matter on general I grounds* The above refers, of course, to official corres pondences nothing we can do will prevent 'private and personal' letters passing between the two potentates. (g) The second alternative is to insist that the official correspondence betweenZShalMi and Ibn Saud should pass through His Majesty's Government's local representatives^ the Minister at Jedda, and the Political A^ent, Kuwait ( or perhaps the Resident, ^ersian Gulf). 'hi s is already the procedure in force (at the Hbaikh^s own request) in regard to the Shailkh's correspondence with the 'Iraq Government, and so no new departure in principle would be involved* The advantage of this alternative would be its emphasis to t Ibn Baud of the special relations that Kuwait has with His | Majesty's Goverment, which emphasis is apparently part i cularly/yl particularly needed at the present juncture. (Vide Conclusion 1 of the Meeting) • As against this advantage Colonel Pick- son is of the opinion that the Shaikh, who regards Ihn Saud, in spite of the latter*s treatment of Kuwait, in a somewhat different light to 'Iraq, might object more or less strongly to the proposal. 6, Considering all the circwnstances I would suggest that I he authorised to instruct Colonel Bickson to approach the Shaikh verbally on the following lines* That His Majesty's Government have had it recently brought to their notice that Ibn Saud apparently harbours designs of trying to reduce Kuwait to a position of dependence on hiia, similar - for instance - to that of Asir; that it is possible that the practilce of direct correspondence between him - the Shaikh - and Ibn Saud which has grown up of late, even though he - the Shaikh - shows the correspondence to the Political Agent, has somewhat obscured in the eyes of Ibn Saud the fact of Kuwait's special relations of protection, etc. with His Majesty's Government; th^t it would put this correspondence on a safer and more regular footing, if it was conducted as was the correspondence with the 'Iraq Government, i.e. through His Majesty's Government's local representatives; that in addition an intimation to this effect to Ibn Saud would bring sharply to his notice Kuwait's relations with His Majesty's Government; and that finally His Majesty's Government would be glad to learn confidentially and in formally what were hie - the Shailsh's - reactions to the proposal. I trust I may be authorised to take this step as Boon/-6- (^) soon as possible, and when the Shaikh' b attitude has 'beeone loioim I nill make recommendations as to vhich alternative &gt; should he adopted. The other question discussed at the meeting, ^ / I (referred to at the beginning of paragraph 2 ahore), was the exact extent of His Majesty's Government's obligations to protect the interests of Kuwait. The most important of these obligations, which are dealt with in the India Office Note on the subject, and the one which in a sense determines any others there may be, is that of protection against hostile incursions or invasions# His Majesty's Government's Agree ments with the Shaikh are three in number: That of January 1899 That of October 1907 That of November 1914* 8. The Agreement of 1899, as far as 'protection' is concerned, in return for the good behaviour of the Shaikh and his successors, merely promised 'the good offices M of His Majesty's Government, ^whatever that mean' as Lord Landsdowne later remarked. Our construction of this Agree ment appears to have been the convenient one that we could choose the circumstances in which we need, or need not, pro tect Kuwait in any particular crisis that arose, the exact area which we were responsible for defending being left more or les&amp; vkgue. 9. The Agreement of 1907 merely confirmed from His Majesty's Government that 'the town of Kuwait and its boundaries' 1 belonged to the Shaikh of that day and his successors. This Agreement in no way added,in principle, to our nebulous responsibilities for the defence of Kuwait, though/11./ though possibly read with that of 1899 it might increase these responsibilities up to the ''boundaries *. 10« The 1914 Agreement states that in return for the Shaikh's co-operation against the Turks Kuwait shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection^ This, unlike the phraseology of the previous Agreements, is a most categorical assurance, and the word , principality , and not 'town* being used, would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Kuwait Shaikhdom on His Majesty's Government, Personally I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office Note that 'on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Kuwait and that we are not called upon to protect Kuwait as a whole'. It is true, as pointed out in the Hote (para graph 16 (dj), that neither the present Shaikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this Agreement to His Majesty's Government, but that hardly relieves tis frcm our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty's Government's obligations relieve the Bhaikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence. The Shaikh, should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers, and should only look for assistance from His Majesty's Government in the case of more serious Incursions. This in fact was presumably the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 19S8 when the Shaikh was encouraged to purchase half-a-dozen Ford vanettes, Lewis guns which were mounted in the vanettes, and aimmnltion, and when some of his wen received training from the Royal Air ^orce as machine gunners.—8— @ uh 11 In conclusion I venture to suggest that this question, the exact extent of the ohllgations of His Majesty's Government for the protection of Kuwait, he InveBtlgated iwlth a view to a definite decision on the subject. The fjie^tion is an important one, and the advantages of having a clear conception of what our responsibilities may be in time of crisis, before such a crisis arises, are obvious.

Bushire.^1*7 (Ut, € ^ oofVot^i ro — P.Z, 7683/33. i v Sir, ® 1st February, 1934, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he has had under his consideration the proceedings of the interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on Thursday, 5th October, 1933, to discuss relations between His Majesty ? s Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit, and also the Political Resident ? s despatch of 25th October 1933, No. 1365~S, containing Colonel Fowle T s recommendations on the tentative conclusions of the meeting in question in the light of discussion of them with the Political Agent, Kowait. 2, In the light of Colonel Fowled views, Sir Samuel Hoare is definitely of opinion that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not at present be further pursued, and he considers that it should be possible to ensure a sufficient degree of British control over the Sheikhdom by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the Sheikh as opportunity offers by filling in the gaps which at present exist in the agreements between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government. The gaps (with the exception of that discussed in the following paragraph and of a slavery agreement), are not in fact very seriousApart from the major assurances contained in the Agreement of 1899, the Sheikh has already given undertakings in respect of the arms traffic; he is precluded from granting a pearling, spongefishing, or oil concession without the approval of/ Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Offioe, , . ^Z-® 01 His Majesty's G-overnment } /though as regards oil the •specific undertaking contained in the letter of 27th Octoher, 19^3 (No. XLI on page 264 of Volume XI of the 1929 edition of Aitchison's Treaties) is by no means so Q l e ar a s , desiref; the control of aviation, whether military or civil, in his State will pass to His Majesty's G-overnment in the event of his accepting the proposals which the Eesident has recently been instructed to make to him on this subject; while the proposed amendment of the Kov/eit Order-in-Council once the Sheikh f s concurrence in this has been obtained, will place the question of jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in his State on a securer and more satisfactor]^ basis• 3. The delicate question of the direct correspondence which has gradually established itself between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud remains for consideration. Sir Samuel Hoare has considered the alternatives .discussed in paragraph 5 of Colonel Fowlers despatch of 25th October, and as a result he is of opinion, subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the first alternative suggested by the Eesident (which incidentally is, apparently, likely to prove the less objectionable to the Sheikh) is the right solution. Subject to Sir John Simon f s concurrence, he would propose, however, to approve the Resident's recommendation that Colonel Dickson should approach the Sheikh verbally on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 of Bushire despatch under consideration, with the modification suggested in Mr. Johnstone's demi-official letter of 25th November lastE.7141/16/91, to Mr.Laithwaite Sir/o • Sir Samuel Hoare would also propose that it might be left to Colonel Fowled discretion, after the Sheikh f s attitude has become known, to settle the matter in accordance with either of the alternatives discussad in paragraph 5 of his Despatch. The important question whether special action should be taken to emphasise at Jedda to Ion Saud the nature of the relations which exist between His Majesty's Grovernment and the Sheikh might be considered when a report has been received from Colonel Fowle, 4. The question of the obligations of His Ma jesty 's Government for the protection of Koweit, to which the Besident refers in paragraphs 7-11 of his despatch, is one of considerable importance. The general position is examined in the India Office memorandum B.4:27/P.Z. 6535/33i of which copies have already been communicated to the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State agrees with the Political Resident that the agreements of 1899 and 1907, containing as they do merely a promise of good offices, the applicability of which to the whole sheikhdom as distinct from the town of Koweit is open to doubt, are not of great material importance so far as! T protectioil T is concerned. The undertaking of real importance is that given to the Sheikh in 1914 in return for the cooperation of his predecessor against the Turks. 5. Subject to Sir John Simon f s views. Sir Samuel Hoare, on a consideration of the position as a whole, is in agreement with Colonel Fowle f s view that the phraseology of this undertaking and the use of the word 'Shaikhdom' and not 'town' would appear to place definitely a responsibility for the protection of the whole principality of Koweit on His Majesty's Government * He is, at the same time, in entire agreement with the Besident that such an/® A 4. an obligation, if His Majesty's troyernment now formally confirm that they recognise its existence, cannot be re gard ed as relieving the Sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence and that 'the Sheikh biioulu certainly oe able uo deal with any small raids across his frontiers and should only look for assistance from His Majesty's Government in the case of more serious incursions.' ouch a construction would, as Colonel Powle, suggests, be consistent with the attitude adopted by His Majesty's Government after the Akhwan operations of 19^8/~9, though it is relevant that no close examination of the precise obligations in the matter of His Majesty's Government was undertaken at that time. Should Sir John Simon share the views expressed in this paragraph. Sir Samuel Hoare will cause the Resident to be instructed accordingly. 5. While the Secretary of State, as stated above, would be opposed to the declaration of a protectorate, and is satisfied, as at present advised, that the desiderata of His Majesty's Government can be sufficiently secured by indirect tightening up of our control over the Sheikh, he is a t the same time impressed by the informal character of the engagements which have been entered into on behalf of Koweit, He would therefore be disposed to see advantage in consolidating the various undertakings which have from time to time been given on either side in a formal treaty on the lines of the Qatar Treaty of 1916, could this be secured without much difficulty. This would probably involve a reiteration and possibly a more formal specification by His Majesty's Government of their responsibility for protection of the principality of/of Koweit. Moreover, as stated in the India Office note B.427/P.Z.6535/33 on this subject, the assurances at present given to the Sheikh are in practice renewed to each successor in return for his acceptance of the obligations, liability for which was accepted by his predecessors, and in 1918 it appears to have been held that our obligations held good only so long as the ruling sheikh on his side complied with his engagements. It is arguable that a formal treaty might place a heavier burden on His Majesty's Government without correspondingly binding the Sheikh. But it seems doubtful whether this view could, in fact, be sustained. Formal recognition by His Majesty f s G-oveminent of a Sheikh of Koweit would presumably be necessary before the engagements entered into with previous Sheikhs could be regarded as binding on either party. Any formal comprehensive treaty which might be dram up could presumably be so framed as to make it clear that obligations were entirely reciprocal and that the liability of His Majesty f s G-overnment held good only so long as they were satisfied with the performance by the Sheikh of his obligations under the treaty. Finally, t so far as protection is concerned, if the view suggested in paragraph 5 above is accepted, that a general liability (within the limits described) for the protection of the principality of Koweit as a whole must already be regarded as resting on His Majesty's Government no material increase of their responsibilities would be involved in reiterating their acceptance of that liability in a formal treaty, while the mere fact of reiteration might make it easier to obtain the consent of the Sheikh to a consolidating agreement. The Secretary of State would welcome Sir John Simon's views on this point. i.i© ((c 6# 7. Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretarjr of State would suggest that, in view of the small margin of difference which appears to exist between the provisional recommendations of the interdepartmental conference of 5th October last, the recommendations of the Political Resident in the Persian Gmlf, and the proposals in this letter, it will be unnecessary, if those proposals commend themselves to Sir John Simon, 1 d refer the question for discussion to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee. Copies of the relevant papers might, however, once final instructions have been sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, be circulated for information to the other Departments represented on that Committee.

His Excellency after listening very attentively and politely to all I had to say, commenced by quietly ask ing me to convey his sincere thanks to His Majesty's Government for their consideration, and for the obviously good intentions underlying their suggestion* He particularly appreciated, he said, the tactful way in which their ideas had been put to him, idh. proved to him that His Majesty's G-ovemment had studied the Arab proverb 'Udkhulu fil biyut min abwabiha, lat insulu min al sat ah' (enter into peoples houses by the main doorw»&amp;v, do not attempt to get in over the housetops),. He nevertheless was compelled to tell His Majesty's Government very definitely and firmly that their suggestion found no favour with him, was dangerous and quite impossible for him to approve of- 8# His Excellency went on to add that His Majesty's Government must forgive him if he spoke candidly, but he thought their proposal had been made without a proper knowledge of local conditions, or a true appreciation of the politics of Saudi Arabia, while psychological, tribal and family considerations had been overlooked entirely* 9* When I asked him to g. ve me something a little more concrete to go on, His Excellency anilingLy said that7¥ ^ 3 - k that he could not consider the proposal for the following reasons: Ca) There was no analogy betwe en the case o f ^Iraq and Bin Sand, The former was looked upon by himself and other Arab Rulers in Arabia as a properly consti tuted ^akiunaV* or Government, comparable to Turkey, Persia or Greece, but that Bin Saud t s Kingdom was something entirely different, and in the eyes of him self and States like Bahrain, Oman etc. was nothing more than a Bedouin autocracy, except perhaps for the Hejaz where Bin Saud liked to keep up a semblance of an organized State with so called Ministers (without power) impress representatives of Foreign Powers^. (b) He (the Shaikh) had certainly requested His Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad to be his channel of correspondence with the 'Iraq Government, and would do so if necessary again, Y/here^ other properly organized State^Y/as concerned, but with Bin Saud matters were as poles apart, and he valued the direct connection too highly to discard it lightly. (c) Bin Saud himself and his family of the A1 Saud were Bedouins at heart and in idea^like himself, they and he not only understood each other perfectly, but were of the same stock and family. (d) He, the Shaikh, and his people originally all came frcm Nejd and Qasim, and although they had greatly suffered from, and loathed Bin Saud f s methods and policy, personal relations had always been good and he and most other xirab rulers were proud of their Arabian King, Y^rho was to them the champion of a Islam, and the Defender of t he true Faith. There was ... • -- ■ . . . ■ such a thing as 'noblesse oblige' also among Arab Rulers. (e) For him as an Arab Ruler to hold direct official communications with Bin Saud, was above all a matter of prestige. The Arabian world (vjhich to him counted] l( - 4 - counted more than eTerytiiing) saw in his doing so, the sign patent that Kuwait vms an independent Arab State, lil® Yemen, thou^i in closest treaty relations with His Majesty's G-ovemiiBnt• (f) * Iraqis by the very nature of their form of G-overnment would realize 1iie reascn why he, the Shaikh, wanted no direct communication with them. The people of Arabia proper and his fellow rulers, conversely would look upon Kuwait as having definitely coae under G-reat Britainqjdirect control {like a colony^ were he to surrender his right to address Bin Saud by direct official letter^ (g) States like Kuwait and Bahrain valued above life their connection with His Majestyfes G-ovemment, but it was one thing to have Sngland a friend and ally, who would come to their help in time of need, qnite another /v. thing to be looked upon as a colony of His Majesty's Government pure and simple. 10 # The Shaikh thai angrily enquired #iat I thought Bin Saud would say, if the proposed arrangement came off. 'He will be overjoyed 1 *, he said, ff and will hold up my first letter under the new arrangement, in open Mejliss, and say 'look oh my people, Kuwait has now been taken over by England Brother Ahmad is no longer an Arab Ruler in Arabia. Behold the first step, the next to go will be Bahrain, and Oman. Did I not tell you not to trust these ISnglish, did I not warn Ahmad of this times without number*' How could he ever face Bin Saud or any Bedouin Shaikh after that, said His Excellency. 11. I here calmed the Shaikh down and he continued in quieter mood by asking why His Majesty's G-ovemment felt distrust of him, and what was wrong with the existing system, whereby he always showed me, his Political Agent and His Majesty's Government's accredited representative, any official letter that went from him to Bin Saud , or which came from Bin Saud to him.- 5 - He called God to witness that not a single missive that so passed, and which contained any sort of comraunication that counted had ever been held back by hinu In this matter His Majesty's Government must remember that he was an Arab Prince of noble blood and honour, and so must trust him to play the game. Was it sense to suppose that he, the Shaikh, who was weaker than Bin Saud, always on the defensive against the latter*s intrigues and underground attacks, and for ever requiring His Majesty's G-ovemment' s help and assistance, would deliberately put himself out of count by keeping back certain of his correspondence with Bin Saud, Why, such conduct would place him in Bin Saud*8 hands at once, and should be rejected as absurd, by His Majesty's Government, here IE. I h8:¥e suggested that perhaps Bin Saud was not aware that he, the Shaikh, made a practice of shewing all official letters to his Political Agent, and that His Majesty's Government's proposal after all anounted to making this plain to Bin Saud. The Shaikh burst out laughingly at this and said, n Believe me, not only does Bin Saud know this very well, but when I saw him last he twitted me unmercifully about it. He has made many efforts to get me not to do so, clearly in order to weaken me with His Majesty's Government and spoil my relations with you, Colonel Dickson, but I am too old a bird to be caught and not only has he failed, but he knows he has failed and will fail, hence his much better treatment of Kuwait in the matter of raids etc. since you took over from Colonel More. Bin Sam today knows that I am carrying out my grandfather^ ohaikh LXubarak's, precepts and •policy in this matter, which v /as to allow no one to ^et between hiin. md the British Joyeriment n , 13 # In conclusion His Excellency begged me to leave well alone both for Ms sake, and for the sake of good relations between His Majesty's Government, himself and his people, also for the sake of His Majesty's Government's relations with other Arabian Rulers in treaty relations withTj - 6 with her, who would be horrified bqyond measure if they thought that His Majesty* s G-oTomnient had possible intentions of acting as T go between' where letters with Bin Saud y /ere concerned^ 14, From my experience of 'the Arab of Arabia proper with whom after all we are dealing in this matter, I am myself definitely of opinion that the best course for us is, as the Shaikh says, to leave well alone. It would be a grave error, I think, at the present moiaent especially, to start hurting the 'pride' of Shaikh Ahmad, in the matter of his correspondence* After all 'pride' is all in all to the Bedouin Arab of the stamp and kind of the Shaikh. The present! system works well and as you have reroarked in one of your despatches to His Majesty's Govermoent , if we want to tighten up control here, we can do so in other and more palatable ways. 15. In the case of the present Ruler relations wi th myself^are, I believe, as near the ideal as possible. There is the closest friendship and cooperation between us, and without wishing to boast, I believe, I can make the Shaikh do most things, if only I am given H ub , and am allowed to progress in my own way. 16» I apologize for iiie inordinate length of this letter but, as the Shaikh's remarks apply with equal force to the future question of a regular protectorate over Kuwait I thought it best to give, you a full account of his talk with 1 me.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your printed despatch No. 81 of the 27th February, in which you call for my observations on the subject of enclosed correspondence regarding the relations between His Majesty's Govern ment and the Sheikh of Koweit y viz., India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 1st February and Foreign Office letter to the India Office of the 24th February. s These letters deal with the following subjects :— {a) Possible declaration of a protectorate over Koweit. {h) Gaps in the existing agreements between His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh of Koweit. {c) Direct correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud. {d) Obligations of His Majesty's Government in regard to Koweit. {e) Suggested substitution of a formal treaty for the existing agreements between His Majesty's Government and the sheikh. 2. As regards {a) above, it has already been decided not to pursue at present the question of declaring a protectorate. All that I need say in this connexion, therefore, is that if at any future time it should prove more practicable than it is at present to declare a protectorate, it would greatly clarify the situation as between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud and would place the former in a much stronger position vis-a-vis of the latter. Looked at from this point of view the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to Koweit should, in my opinion, be considered to some extent in conjunction with the question, which has recently become active, of their policy in regard to the other areas to the east and south-east of Ibn Saud's dominions. 3. The subjects at (6), {d) and {e) above are so far outside my province that I cannot usefully offer any observations on them. I propose therefore to confine myself to the question of direct correspondence between the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud on official subjects. There is general agreement, I think, as to the desirability of controlling this correspondence and the only question which arises is that of the best means of establishing an effective control, having regard to both practical and legal considerations. 4. So far as the practical considerations are concerned, I am inclined to share your view as to the inadequacy of the course indicated in paragraph 5 (1) of the Political Resident's despatch to the India Office of the 25th October. You have yourself pointed out that it would be difficult for His Majesty's Government to disavow communications addressed by the sheikh to Ibn Saud without the approval of the Political Agent, unless communications which had been approved by him bore some indication of that fact. I may add that this alternative no less than the other would necessitate an undertaking not only with the sheikh, but with Ibn Saud. It would have to be made clear to the latter that unapproved communications could not be invoked against either His Majesty's Government or the sheikh himself and that communications addressed by the King on his side to the sheikh must be considered not only by the sheikh but by the Political Agent. If this position were established the effect would be much the same as that of Colonel Fowle's second alternative, except for one thing, namely, the difficulty of discriminating between official and unofficial communications. This difficulty appears to me to be very great in the case of two rulers whose practice appears to be to exchange purely personal letters and to deal with official matters in enclosures appended to them. 5. The adoption of Colonel Fowle's second alternative would not obviate the danger of the sheikh compromising his position by direct letters, but it would [81 q—1]2 establish quite definitely the fact that such letters could have no sort of official character. It may perhaps be hoped that both rulers would then realise a their direct correspondence had better be confined to personal greetings an news. It remains to be considered whether the legal position is such as to enable Mis Majesty's Government to impose the proposed system, firstly, on tne sneiK , and, secondly, on Ibn Saud. It is not for me to deal with this question as regards the sheikh, but I submit the following observations as regards Ibn Saud. 6. When the Treaty of Jedda was being negotiated His Majesty s brovern- ment wished to include in it a clause similar to article 6 of the Treaty oi tne 26th December, 1915, by which Ibn Saud undertook 'to refrain irom ali aggression on, or interference with the territories of Koweit, Bahrein and oi the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are under the protection of the British Government and who have treaty relations with the said Government. The use of ' who' in this clause seems to confine the application of the words 'under the protection of' to the Sheikhs of Qatar, &amp;c. Ibn Saud rejected the clause and His Majesty's Government accepted the substance of a counter proposal by Ibn Saud, subject to the addition of the words ' who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Government.' P ro&lt; i uce( i article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda as we now have it. The word '' who ' stands, but was perhaps not intended to be used limitatively. Anyhow, His Majesty's Government had made it clear in their instructions to Sir G. Clayton that they attached the same meaning to the form of clause to which they were willing to agree as to the clause they had themselves proposed. 7. After the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda, His Majesty's Government communicated to Ibn Saud a number of treaties with Arabian rulers. In the case of Koweit they communicated only the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, together with two minor agreements of the 24th May, 1900, and the 25th February, 1904, regarding arms and postal matters. In the covering note, however, the Acting Agent and consul at Jedda reproduced the following explanation from Foreign Office despatch No. Ill of the 29th September, 1927 :— 'His Majesty's Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement of 1899, His Majesty's Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices, but at the same time His Majesty's Government have reserved to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion. His Majesty's Government have also assured the sheikh that they recognise (1) that the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to him and to his heirs after him; (2) that all his arrangements shall remain in the hands of himself and his heirs; and (3) that they will not take customs or anything in any lands they may rent, or in which they may dwell, within the limits of Koweit. Finally, His Majesty's Government have assured the sheikh that Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' 8. Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda recognises the possibility of relations between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit, which were to be friendly and peaceful. This, presumably, need not mean more than that Ibn Saud was to observe a friendly and peaceful attitude and Ibn Saud knows that the sheikh is not free to receive the agent of any foreign Power without British sanction. We are, however, eternally dogged by the contradictory expression 'independent principality under British protection,' a definition which we have tried to abandon, but which remains on record as between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud. 9. This survey leaves me doubtful as to whether His M^ajesty's Government would be on absolutely safe ground in informing Ibn Saud of their own motion that he must not correspond with the Sheikh of Koweit except through British channels. I suggest, therefore, that any communication on the subject to the Saudi Government will be made expressly as the result of an understanding between them and the sheikh. &amp; 10.

As will be seen, the Shaikh's reactions were most unfavourable to the suggestion made to him that official correspondence between him and Ibn Saud should pass through Hi s Majesty 's (rOTernment ' s local representa tives, His Majesty 's Minister at Jed da on the one hand, and the Political Agent, Kuwait,( or perhaps the Resident), on the other. 3. As pointed out in paragraph 5 (a) of my letter No.l365-S of 25th October 1933, since the suggested procedure was already in force, at the Shaikh's own request, in regard to the Shaikh's corresoondence with the/ ■moi-2- the 'Iraq Goverrment, no new departure In principle i»as involved. The Shaikh's reply to this argument apparently « i7as th?t - In Colonel 'Dickson's ^vords - there ^as no analogy 'between the case of 'Iraq and Ihn 3aud, The former ^sas looked upon 'by himself and other Arab Rulers in Arabia as a properly constituted 'Hakuma* or Goverim ent, ccmparahle to Turkey, Persia or Greece, 'but that Ihn Saud's Kingdom was something entirely different, and in the eyes of himself and Btates like Bahrain, Oman, etc, was nothing more than a Bedouin autocracy, except perhaps for the Hedjaz where I'bn Baud liked to keep up a semblance of an organized State with so called Ministers (without power) to impress representatives of foreign Powers. 4. There may be something in this from the Arab point of view, but politically this argument cannot hold water. Ibn Baud himself created a governuent - outwardly we at least - on Wes+ern lines, and/treat it as such. The Bhaikh in fact, not for the first time, is trying to have it both ways. He is willing to consider himself under our protection when he is oppressed by Ibn Saud, in the matter of the Blockade for instance, yet at the same time wants unfettered correspondence with the same oppressor, 5. However, I am of opinion that Colonel Dickson's approach to the Shaikh, which roust be remembered ^as, as suggested in paragraph 6 of my letter already quoted, on confidential and informal lines, has done good. It has on the one hand shown us hat the Shaikh's views are on the matter, and on the other has doubtless impressed on the latter/latter that ve regard the question of his correspondence with Ibn Baud as of importance. In view of not worrying the Shai&amp;h while the Kuwait 0 il negotiations are in progress I aj?i of opinion that this question of correspondence had 'better not he pursued for the nresent. X think however that at an appropriate moment something might he done on the lines suggested in paragraph 4 of Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch Ho.84 of 29th March 1934 to the foreign Office. Would it not be practicable to intimate to Ihn Saud and the Bhaikh that official letters from Ibn Saud to the 3hail&lt;h woulr 1 have to be shown to the British Minister, and letters from the Shaikh to Ibn Saud would have to be shown to the Political Agent. farther that any letter not so shown would be considered of a purely private nature and could not be invoked against either His Majesty's Governnent, or either party. 7, It seems to me that this procedure while impressing on Ibn Saud our special relations with Kuwait, i and protecting the interests of His Majesty's Government, might at the same time tend to ruffle the susceptibilities ^ of both potentates less than the somewhat hard and fast procedure to which the Bhaikh has reacted so unfavourably. 8, With regard to Sir Andrew Hyan's further remarks on the difficulty of checking private correspondence between the two 'Rulers. I do not think, as I pointed out at the end of -oaragraph 5 (l) of my letter quoted above, that any system we could devise would prevent ^private and personal**/-4- 2^' persoml 1 * letters passing 'between ISiwait and Hiyadh, and if we are in a position to consider such cominunications as private I do not see that these can do us much harm, I am sending a copy of this letter to the Goverrment of India# I have the honour to 'bei Sir, Tour most obedient, humble servant, Lt.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.3 By Air Mail 7 2 / so ■ &gt; v f @ Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office. 2 74ph i5$4 India Office, Whitehall _ j London.

Section 1. 57 India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received February 1.) India Office, February 1, 1934. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he has had under his consideration the proceedings of the interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on Thursday, the 5th October, 1933, to discuss relations between His Majesty's Goyernment in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit, ^ an( l also the Political Resident's despatch of the 25th October, 1933, containing Colonel Fowle's recommendations on the tentative conclusions of the meeting in question in the light of discussion of them with the Political Agent, Koweit. 2. In the light of Colonel Fowle's views, Sir Samuel Hoare is definitely of opinion that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not at present be further pursued, and he considers that it should be possible to ensure a sufficient degree of British control over the sheikhdom by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the sheikh as opportunity offers, by filling in the gaps which at present exist in the agreements between the sheikh and His Majesty's Government. The gaps (with the exception of that discussed in the following paragraph and of a slavery agreement) are not, in fact, very serious. Apart from the major assurances contained in the agreement of 1899, the sheikh has already given undertakings in respect of the arms traffic; he is precluded from granting a pearling, sponge-fishing, or oil concession without the approval of His Majesty's Government (though as regards oil the specific undertaking contained in the letter of the 27th October, 1913 (No. XLI on p. 264 of Volume XI of the 1929 edition of Aitchisoris Treaties), is by no means so clear as could be desired); the control of aviation, whether military or civil, in his State will pass to His Majesty's Government in the event of his accepting the proposals which the Resident has recently been instructed to make to him on this subject; while the proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council, once the sheikh's con currence in this has been obtained, will place the question of jurisdiction over non- Moslem foreigners in his State on a securer and more satisfactory basis. 3. The delicate question of the direct correspondence which has gradually established itself between the sheikh and Ibn Saud remains for consideration. Sir Samuel Hoare has considered the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of Colonel Fowle's despatch of the 25th October, and as a result he is of opinion, subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the first alternative suggested by the Resident (which incidentally is, apparently, likely to prove the less objectionable to the sheikh) is the right solution. Subject to Sir John Simon's concurrence, he would propose, however, to approve the Resident's recommendation that Colonel Dickson should approach the sheikh verbally on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 of Bttshire despatch under con sideration, with the modification suggested in Mr. Johnstone's demi-official letter of the 25th November last to Mr. Laithwaite. Sir Samuel Hoare would also propose that it might be left to Colonel Fowle's discretion, after the sheikh's attitude has become known, to settle the matter in accordance with either of the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch. The important question whether special action should be taken to emphasise at Jedda to Ibn Saud the nature of the relations which exist between His Majesty's Government and the sheikh might be considered when a report has been received from Colonel Fowle. 4. The question of the obligations of His Majesty's Government for the protection of Koweit, to which the Resident refers in paragraphs 7-11 of his despatch, is one of considerable importance. The general position is examined in the India Office memorandum B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33, of which copies have already been communicated to the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State agrees with the Political Resident that the agreements of 1899 and 1907, containing as they do merely a promise of good offices, the applicability of which to the whole sheikhdom as distinct from the town of Koweit is open to doubt, are not of great material importance so. far as 'protection' is concerned. The undertaking of [31 a—1]\ real importance is that given to the sheikh in 1914 in return for the co-operation of his predecessor against the Turks. . . * 5. Subject to Sir John Simon's views, Sir Samuel Hoare, on a consideration of the position as a whole, is in agreement with Colonel Fowle's view that the * phraseology of this undertaking and the use of the word 'sheikhdom' and not '' town '' would appear to place definitely a responsibility for the protection of the whole principality of Koweit on His Majesty's Government. He is, at the same time, in entire agreement with the Resident that such an obligation, if His Majesty's Government now formally confirm that they recognise its existence, cannot be regarded as relieving the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence, and that '' the sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers and should only look for assistance from His Majesty's Government in the case of more serious incursions.' Such a construction would, as Colonel Fowle suggests, be consistent with the attitude adopted by His Majesty's Government after the Akhwan operations of 1928-29, though it is relevant that no close examination of the precise obligations in the matter of His / Majesty's Government was undertaken at that time. Should Sir John Simon share the views expressed in this paragraph, Sir Samuel Hoare will cause the Resident to be instructed accordingly. 6. While the Secretary of State, as stated above, would be opposed to the declaration of a protectorate, and is satisfied, as at present advised, that the desiderata of His Majesty's Government can be sufficiently secured by indirect tightening up of our control over the sheikh, he is at the same time impressed by the informal character of the engagements which have been entered into on behalf of Koweit. He would, therefore, be disposed to see advantage in consolidating the various undertakings which have from time to time been given on either side in a formal treaty, on the lines of the Qatar Treaty of 1916, could this be secured without much difficulty. This would probably involve a reiteration and possibly a more formal specification by His Majesty's Government of their responsibility for protection of the principality of Koweit. Moreover, as stated in the India Office note B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33 on this subject, the assurances at present given to the sheikh are, in practice, renewed to each successor in return for his acceptance V of the obligations, liability for which was accepted by his predecessors, and in 1918 it appears to have been held that our obligations held good only so long as * the ruling sheikh on his side complied with his engagements. It is arguable that a formal treaty might place a heavier burden on His Majesty's Government with out correspondingly binding the sheikh. But it seems doubtful whether this view could, in fact, be sustained. Formal recognition by His Majesty's Government of a Sheikh of Koweit would presumably be necessary before the engagements entered into with previous sheikhs could be regarded as binding on either party. Any formal comprehensive treaty which might be drawn up could presumably be so framed as to make it clear that obligations were entirely reciprocal, and that the liability of His Majesty's Government held good only so long as they were satisfied with the performance by the sheikh of his obligations under the treaty. Finally, so far as protection is concerned, if the view suggested in paragraph 5 above is accepted, that a general liability (within the limits described) for the protection of the principality of Kowsit as a whole must already be regarded as resting on His Majesty s Government, no material increase of their responsibilities would be involved in reiterating their acceptance of that liability in a formal treaty while the mere fact of reiteration might make it easier to obtain the consent of the ^ sheikh to a consolidating agreement. The Secretary of State would welcome feir John Simon's views on this point. 7. Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the Secretary of State would suggest that, in view of the small margin of difference which appears to exist between the provisional recommendations of the inter departmental conference of the 5th October last, the recommendations of the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, and the proposals in this letter it will be unnecessary, if those proposals commend themselves to Sir John Simon to refer the question for discussion to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee. Copies of the relevant papers might, however, once final instructions have been sent to the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, be circulated for information to the other Departments represented on that committee.

He would, however, suggest that thereafter the Political Resident should report further which of a v u tlVe courses of action discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch of the r?- 11 V c , ob ^'. 1933 ' he recommends, before adopting either, in order that His Majesty s Minister at Jedda may be given an opportunity of furnishing his observations. As at present advised. Sir John Simon is inclined to prefer the second alternative proposed by Colonel Fowle (viz., that all official correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud should pass exclusively through the Political Kesident or Political Agent and his Majestv's representative at Jedda), as emphasising more strongly the special position of His Majesty's Government in Koweit, and placing a more effectual check upon Ibn Saud's attempts to strengthen his own position there to the detriment of that held by His Majesty's Government. This course would, in Sir John Simon's view, have the additional advantage that the influence of His Majesty's representative at Jedda could, when necessary, be more easily exerted upon the Saudi Government, if he were the actual channel of the sheikh's communications. 4. In any case, it appears that, were the first alternative adopted, it would not be sufficient simply to exercise a discreet control in Koweit over direct correspondence between King Ibn Saud and the sheikh. For, although the sheikh's side of the correspondence would be seen by the Political Agent, there would be no indication of this fact on the document which reached Ibn' Saud If, therefore, the sheikh were to send Ibn Saud a letter which the Political Agent had not seen and which His Majesty's Government wished to repudiate on that ground, they might find some difficulty in establishing with King Ibn Saud the fact that they were justified in doing so, since, so far as he could see, this letter would be no less authentic than others which he had exchanged with the sheikh, and which he had been tacitly led to consider perfectly in order. It would, therefore, in Sir John Simon's view, be necessary to add to those of the sheikh's letters which the Political Agent had seen and approved some indication of that fact. But such an arrangement would probably in the sheikh's eyes be as unwelcome a limitation on his official correspondence with Ibn Saud as the second alternative proposed by Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle. 5. It further appears to Sir John Simon that, since it is proposed in the first place, when sounding the sheikh orally, to suggest to him that all his official correspondence with Ibn Saud should be conducted through His Majesty's local representatives, to fall back later on the first alternative proposed by Lieutenant- Colonel Fowle would represent a weakening on the part of His Maiestv's Government, which on general grounds would be better avoided. 6. A final decision in the matter must, however, evidently depend upon the report furnished by Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle after the preliminary oral approach to the sheikh. 7. As regards the obligations of His Majesty's Government in respect of the protection of Koweit, Sir John Simon agrees with the views expressed in paragraphs 4 and 5 of your letter under reply. [31 aa—1]8. He has also considered the proposal in paragraph 6 of that letter for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the sheikh, which should include inter alia the acceptance by His Majesty's Government of a general liability for the protection of the Whole sheikhdom within the limits indicated in paragraph 10 of Colonel Powle's despatch of the 25th October, referred to above. While agreeing that there would be advantage in such a treaty. Sir John Simon assumes that it is not proposed to undertake the negotiation of it immediately. Prima facie it seems inadvisable to raise a possibly controversial issue of such importance with the sheikh until the question of his relations with King Ibn Saud and that of the projected oil concession (which appears likely to indispose the sheikh, since he may lose financially by the elimination of competition between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the United States oil interests) have been disposed of. 9. As regards the possibility mentioned in paragraph 6 of your letter, that a formal treaty might be considered to place a heavier burden on His Majesty's Government than that which they at present bear in respect of Koweit, without correspondingly binding the sheikh, I am to observe that, in accordance with the construction which is usually placed upon treaties with heads of States, any formal treaty concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit would attach to Koweit as a State, and would apply automatically to the sheikh's successors. The under takings given by the two contracting parties to a treaty must certainly be construed as reciprocal. Sir John Simon notes, however, from statements made by the India Office representative at the meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 5th October to discuss this question, that it is considered that His Majesty's Government could and would remove a Sheikh of Koweit for hopeless misgovern- ment. He presumes, therefore , that His Majesty's Government could in practice prevent the accession of a ruler who seemed unlikely to observe his treaty obligations towards them, or could, at any rate, remove a ruler who after his accession in fact refused to observe those obligations. If this be so, there appears no ground for fearing that a situation might arise in which His Majesty's Government would be faced with the alternatives either of acquiescing in a refusal by the sheikh to recognise his treaty obligations or of putting an end to their treaty relations with Koweit. 10. Sir John Simon concurs in the view of Sir Samuel Hoare that it is* unnecessary to refer this question to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee, but he assumes that copies of the relevant papers will be circulated later to the Departments represented thereupon.

In the light of the correspondence in question, the Secretary of State agrees that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not for the present be further pursued. 3.

The Secretary of State would be glad in due course to receive your views on the proposal referred to in paragraph 6 of India Office letter of the 1st February for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh of Koweit. The matter is not one of immediate urgency, and it may well be that, as suggested by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, there may be advantage in deferring any reference to it until further progress has been made in the disposal of the vexed question of the relations of the sheikh with King Ibn Saud and the questions of oil concessions for Koweit proper and the neutral zone between Koweit and Nejd. 6. The interdepartmental meeting of the 5th October recommended, inter alia, that the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with King Ibn Saud by His Majesty's Government on the basis of their obligation to protect [56 m—1]the interests of Koweit.

[E 6077/16/91] 1. —Final Record of a Meeting held at the Foreign Office, on October 5, 1933. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. G. W. Rendel {in the Chair), Foreign Office. Mr. K. R. Johnstone, Foreign Office. Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty's Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persiati^ulL Mr. J. G. Laithwaite, India Office. The meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan's note of the 16th Augusts regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). Mr. Rendel outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty's Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity, and that it must there fore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy of His Majesty's Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was possible, to maintain their present treaty relationship with the Sheikh. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty's Government than it had been at any time, since it had bulked so prominently as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway before the war. This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air stand- point as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and, secondly, owing to the expira- tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty's Government with that country. So long as Iraq had been under British control, there had been a natural tendency to give it prior consideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively m the background But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance Geographically, Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one from which the Gulf could be controlled. In the event of war we could probably sately assume that Koweit would be on our side and her territory would afford us a base - of operations of definite value, to the use of which, on the assumption m question, ^ W no objection could be raised on the ground that we were violating her neutrality Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the Last, Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that route, especially if our relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes of that route. Colonel Fowle suggested that in point of fact it might one day be possible to avoid the use of Iraq altogether, and fly direct from Palestine to Koweit, as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route increased. Mr. Rendel concurred with Mr. Laithwaite's estimate of the position as regards Iraq. In view of recent events in Iraq it was possible that our whole relationship with that country might have to be modified, and he considered that both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and of the position of the Royal Air Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful. On the general point at issue, he 7329 [9823] Bobserved that one of the main points to be borne in mind was iiie fact that Koweit was not naturally independent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It was a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed, and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It was for consideration, therefore, whether it would, in fact, be practicable for His Majesty's Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty's Government. Colonel Fowle concurred generally in Mr. Rendel's description of the economic position of the sheikhdom. He pointed out, however, that Koweit had always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrein was the port of Central Arabia. In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit's fresh water supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit over, for instance, the question of smuggling. Mr. Rendel agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to increase, unless, of course, Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak, and Sir Andrew Ryan's note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Saud could exert. The question, therefore, was whether His Majesty's Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had, in fact, been suggested that it might be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance, the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate, but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Koweit. Would not a protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Laithwaite drew attention to three points :— (a) At present the obligations of His Majesty's Government to Koweit were represented by their undertaking to grant '' good offices ' in respect of Koweit under the 1899 agreement, by their promise of 1907 that ''the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him,' and their undertaking of the 3rd November, 1914, that Koweit, in the event of a victory over the Turks, would be recognised by us as an independent princi pality under British protection. They were thus very general in terms, and, in accordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations, save as regards good offices to Koweit town and the immediately adjoining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This was to some extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. &lt;5) With regard to the suggested establishment of a protectorate it was necessary to consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, and also what effect the proclamation of a protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers of the Gulf. It would in any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature, since both in Bahrein and m Qatar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouse3 % 3 &gt; apprehensions and might even cause the local sheikhs to turn away from His Majesty's Government and consider submitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn Saud. {c) The basis of His Majesty's Government's present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place, it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of formal treaties with the Sheikh dating back for over a century, or, as in the case of Qatar, on a comprehensive treaty^ but was based only on a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the sheikhs and His Majesty's Government since 1899 and on tne reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered into in connexion with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1907; secondly, there were certain gaps, e.g., we had no slavery agreement with Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible * gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in that way. An example was our recent request to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrate effective contl-ol of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty's Government. Another instance was the recent proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council so as to place responsibility for jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty's Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties involved m establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. Colonel Fowle expressed the view that there did not seem to be any inter mediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the Sheikh on the present lines and a full protectorate. The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and, prima facie, he v tj 1 ? -^ 0 ^ e ) was no t much in favour of it. He agreed, however, that it would be advisable, on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position ms-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weakness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficulties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our normal control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. ' Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Government, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovern- ment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit, we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-a-vis of the foreign Power concerned. i. Laithwaite said that on this point he thought that Bahrein might be regarded as locus classicus. We had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last, in our view, became intolerable, we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. There were obvious arguments for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch, it would be most difficult for us to justify a refusal to allow foreign Governments which might be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. He did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Saud and Koweit. [9823] B 2(D (f * Sir Andrew Ryan stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty's Government's position vis-a-vis of Ibn Saud with regard to Koweit. His Majesty's Government were not strongly placed when it became necessary to warn Ibn Saud to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintaining that Koweit was technically an independent State. A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory, referred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. Colonel Fowls pointed out that, in fact, our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Saud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government. Speaking generally, he added that, in fact, little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit, so long as it remained a Bedouin town ruled by a Bedouin sheikh, and not, like Bahrein, a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If, however, oil were discovered within the sheikhdom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly. If Iraq were to adopt an anti-foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there. We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit. We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty's Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control. Mr. Laithwaite agreed, and added that, in his view, our policy should be directed towards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declaration of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrein and of the Trucial Coast, and do more harm than good. The policy to be followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the sheikhdom. Reverting to the question of Saudi-Koweiti relations. Sir Andrew Ryan drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty's Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. This no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending a 7 16 corres P on( i ence i n question was of such long standing that it was &lt;1 1 fficii t ncwffr us 1° take the line that Ibn Saud should write to us rather than to the bheikh. What was desirable was that we should be able to tell' Ibn Saud dispute ^ Were responsible for defendin g the Sheikh's interests in any given Mr. Laithwaite said that the explanation of the system of direct corresnon denoe between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud was, he thought, that it dated from a time when the latter was not so important a ruler as he had since become and when we had taken the view that it was unnecessary to take too strict a view of correspondence between sheikh and sheikh. That position was now changed and reconsideration seemed j desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that His Majesty s Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the Sheikh had undertaken certain obligations towards us. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondencf in question Td to emphasise our own special position in Koweit vis-a-vis of Ihn Saud more definitely than had been the case while Iraq was still under British oontrnl w! suggested that we might (a) check Ibn Saud when he appeareT f be SumS too far with regard to Koweit—a policv which we were in fnr.t™ Presuming to follow in regard to the Saudi P Ko4it btkad' and\5renCee P Xt2 regulations on the Sheikh m the matter of direct correspondence. 06 8trlct er Colonel Fowle agreed. Such action would show hnth ^ qi . -i ^ j -n Saud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction If w T h t take some such step as this, we might be in danger of finding ourselSs facS witt the results of a kind of conspiracy between the Sheikh and Ibn SanT wf A therefore, to write to the Sheikh in the sense that w nSd ^fi h^pSe-correspondence with Ibn Saud had assumed an increasing importance, and tell nim that that correspondence must now cease. Mr. concurred. A straightforward control of this nature would be easier to maintain, and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter m which Ibn Saud had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his connexion with His Majesty's Government. Sir A. Ryan also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ibn Saud was spreading the idea that he might naturally absorb Koweit and was bound to do so sooner or later. He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty's Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit. The meeting then discussed what point in the correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud could most suitably be taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to both parties. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose, what action could be taken if the United States Government, in dealing with whom His Majesty's Government had consistently emphasised the Sheikh's independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone? It was, however, agreed that His Majesty's Government could demonstrate from the Sheikh's treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant without our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Saud would be Ibn Saud's letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty's Government. At the conclusion of the meeting Sir A. Ryan raised the question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arabia, or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty's Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question, therefore, was what real force there was in Ibn Saud's suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. Colonel Fowle suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh's proposal that Ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti-Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even if Ibn Saud were to develop Ras Tanura, possibly with American help, this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a different hinter land, nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras Tanura area which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit. Colonel Fowle suggested that on his return to the Gulf on the 16th October he should discuss the situation with Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, Koweit, who had great experience of the sheikhdom, in the light of the conversations at the present meeting, and should submit a comprehensive report. It was agreed that this course should be adopted, and that in the light of the Resident's report and of the conclusions of the present meeting the question of future policy in Koweit should be discussed if necessary in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee. The conclusions of the meeting were as follows (1) That in dealing with Ibn Saud, His Majesty's Government should increasingly emphasise the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh. (2) That the Sheikh should be told that his personal correspondence with Ibn Saud on official matters was to cease. (3) That the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with Ibn Saud by His Majesty's Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit.6 (4) That on receipt of the despatch promised by Colonel Fowle the whole question of relations between His Majesty's Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle East Official Sub-Committee, to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the argu ments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorate. Appendix A. Note hy Sir Andrew Ryan. Ihn Sand's Attitude towards Koweit. I HAVE been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Saud's policy to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asir from 1926 to 1930. This is in the nature of a pure speculation, but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head,^ he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty's Govern ment. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, but he understands very well the implications of the words therein 'who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Govern ment.' On the other hand, he has seen His Majesty's Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2. Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh's visit to Biadh in 1932, the secret messages brought by Ibn Saud's confidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year, and the Sheikh's mysterious dashes intoNejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud's attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's Government should not concern themselves with affairs between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. I class them as minor, because this position has never been categorically asserted. The first was when, in reply to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Koweit territory, whick had perturbed His Majesty's Government, the reply was in effect: 'Sorry you have been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had been pursued through An. INafisi.' On another occasion Fuad Bey, in rather light conversa tion, asked me why we concerned ourselves in matters between his Government and Koweit. 4. The personal relations between the two rulers are peculiar. Ibn Saud grew up at Koweit, and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is said by others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that Mubarak treated Ibn Saud very badly. Anyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendship, however flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Saud from enforcing the embargo on trade, but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikh's ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Saud. They are 'Arcades ambo,' as I once wrote, and they both combine some real friendship for His Majesty's Government and a healthy fear of them with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. 5. The point of my theory or speculation is that, if the Sheikh of Koweit were at all willing to be 'Asirised,' Ibn Saud could make the proposal quite attractive on the following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use :— (a) ' You are not really independent, my dear fellow. You are under the thumb of the English. They might annex you at any moment, or even present you to Iraq. If you must be dependent on some one, wirybe dependent on those untrustworthy imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia ? (b) 'I don't like squeezing you, I really don't, with that embargo. As things are at present, I have to think of my own interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily have an understanding. A sort of ' Zollverein' as they say; same duties levied in our ports; free competition between yours and mine; free trade over our land border. What have the English done about it ? Nothing; because they cannot get at me. ' Sois mon frere et je te fais vivre. Sois le leur et je te tue.' (c) 'I should not mop you up, of course. You would rule your State under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such a mess that he asked me to in 1930. I did not hit him on the head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck from me. (d) 'You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. What has England been able or even willing to do for you ? If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you would find that i knew how to see you through. {e) ' Then there's oil. People are after it in my country, and in yours, and in the Neutral Zone. Why not have an agreed policy and present a common front to the West? You know what the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is. Another name for the British Government, as we saw in Persia the other day, even if we had not known it before. Take my tip and keep them out at all costs. Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don't trust him, and remember that in the long run your best policy would be to deal, like me, direct with American interests, using the others to put up the price.' 6. It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address. I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be, but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, might find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Saud's parlour. 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration. They may, however, be worthy of some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country, and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation. Except that Ibn Saud continues to show a marked anxiety to avoid all compli cations, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working theory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments. August 16, 1933. Appendix B. N ote. Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. (A)— Nature of the Undertakings given. By the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, His Majesty's Government formally assured the Sheikh 'of the good offices of the British Government .towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successorsf &amp; 8 ¥\ scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond, under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government, and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent of His Majesty's Government. 2. By article 9 of the Secret Agreement of the 15th October, 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was ' duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise, and do hereby promise, that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mobarak's arrangements in the matter of customs, &amp;c., and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and . . . In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy j * customs dues in excess of 4 per cent, on goods imported or exported by 'the subjects of the aforesaid English Government,' save with the approval of that Government. 3. The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, contained an assurance that ' Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' (B)— Construction of the Undertakings given to the Sheikh. 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty's Govern ment with the Sheikh are in rather general terms, and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Majesty's Government. 5. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit, the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State's telegram No. 45 of the 4th December, 1901) that this 'appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan's promise' (to respect the status quo), ' and in these circumstances His Majesty's Government are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us.' The assurance given is clearly limited by the words ' in these circumstances ' to this particular case. More over, it is not conditional on, and is independent of the Sheikh's observance of his agreement of 1899. 6. On the 21st March, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a memorandum on the situation in Koweit, remarked that our obligations toward the Sheikh were c&lt; as ill-defined as the boundaries of his principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British 'protection'; on the other hand, we once made him a present of £1,000, and promised him our ' good offices,' whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing, and not of Boobyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another .... We might, it seems to me, explain (1) to the Porte; (2) to the Sheikh; and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name, and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district ' 7. Later, in 1902, it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Saud, then the Sheikh of Koweit's friend and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the Shfikh informed us that Ibn Saud had with him a gun presented by the Turks, and asked for a eift of two or three guns, which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against land attack. The Viceroy (telegram No 39 of the Srd OrtnW 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh's Vequest could llot be grald ' tt that, provided he complied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance of your telegram of the 4th December, 1901 (see paragraph 5 above), His Majesty^Government would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.' The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter of the 13th October, 1902), replied (telegram No. 133 of the 14th October, 1902): 'I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name.' This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc, and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government of India whether the definition in question of Koweit territory had been communicated to the Sheikh, they replied that it might be assumed that it had, but that it only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ibn Rashid, who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit' (telegram of the 6th April, 1911). 8. The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907, and quoted in paragraph 2 above, may be regarded as to some extent committing us in respect of 'the town of Koweit and its boundaries.' The phrase '' its boundaries '' is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the immediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911, and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. 9. In 1911, in connexion with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne's memorandum of 1902, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to ' define the region to which our obligation extends,' and 'whether they accepted' general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, p. 1059, &amp;c., replied : ' We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh's territory; (2) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion. . . .' 10. The Secretary of State for India, in the light of the Government of India's views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (the 8th April, 1911) :— ' Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21st March, 1902, is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by his Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbour hood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India's telegram of the 6th April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol. II, pp. 1059-1061, of Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession. In this Lord Morley concurs; that is to say, he thinks that, in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits. His Majesty's Government could not abstain from using their ' good offices ' in the Sheikh's favour. But the term ' good offices ' is a very vague one, which His Majesty's Government are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness, according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, however, in his Lordship's opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions, and could not fail to affect unfavourably our prestige in the Persian Gulf. ...' 11. The Foreign Office replied, on the 9th May, 1911, that Sir E. Grey concurred ' in the view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh, as described in the passage of Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which your letter refers.' 12. In August 1911 the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P. Cox), recommended that His Majesty's Government should communicate to the Turks a copy of the agreement of 1899, with a note that His Majesty's Government had subsequently informed the Sheikh that, so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against [9823] c10 attack by land or sea. The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 30th October, 1911, remarked :— ' The telegrams of the 4th December, 1901, and the 14th October, 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe's opinion, clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh's territory, as described in Lorimer's Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by- Lord Morley in this Office letter of the 8th April last, the term £ good offices ' (which, by Colonel Meade's letter of the 23rd January, 1899, we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty's Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. '' His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run : ' As regards No. 1, His Majesty's Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement. His Majesty's Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,' with, perhaps, the addition that His Majesty's Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.' The Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter dated the 1st November, 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition, and a communication in this sense was made to Tevfik Pasha in Sir Edward Grey's letter of the 24th October, 1911. 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit ' shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection,' may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole. 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed, in March 1916, on his accession, by the Viceroy, that, ' so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government, you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.' A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir's death in 1917 to his brother and successor. Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. Sheikh Salim's conduct was unsatisfactory, and it was found necessary to warn him, through the Political Resident, on the 5th July, 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of the 3rd November, 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts contrary to the interests of His Majesty's Government unfortunately be committed in future,' he would be held personally responsible. 15. In connexion with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928 the question of the precise extent of the obligations of His Majesty's Government for the defence of Koweit was considered in the India Office, when the view was put forward that consideration of our engagements suggested that, on a strict reading, our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole. The history of the 1928 discussion is, however, examined in greater detail in Appendix C, to the conclusions of which attention is invited. C onclusion. 16. As will be seen from the correspondence summarised above, we appear consistently to have taken the view that our obligations are conditional on the good behaviour of the Sheikh; (5) secondly, that, subject to this reservation i ? g00d 0 ® C f in res P ect of ' Koweit,' an assurance which i Vwf v ! k f 1 ac&lt; i e ] p as extending to the whole territory of the sheikhdom hut which would not commit us to anything further than diplomatic support; A thirdly, that we have promised ' that the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to the heirs of Sheikh Mobarak (while the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh site was terminated in 1907, the agreement of 1907 was not abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges embodied in that Agreement should11 apparently still be regarded as binding in so far as they are not affected by other snbsequent instruments. We communicated article 9 of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Saud in 1928; and in 1933 the Political Agent, Koweit, and the Political Resident brought to notice the continued existence of the obligations of the Sheikh in regard to customs duties (paragraph 2 above) under article 10 of the agreement); (c?) fourthly, that we have undertaken to recognise, and have in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of British protection '' in this connexion; and, while prima facie the Sheikh would apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors. J. G. LAITHWAITE India Office, October 11, 1933. Appendix C. S upplementary N ote. Question of Liability for the Protection of Koweit against Aggression from Outside, 1928-29. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925, but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the principality. At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty's Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty's Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on the 27th January, 1928, and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again success fully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty's Government under existing engagements for the 'protection of Koweit' (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive) was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty's Government and the Government of India agreed that his Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars. 2. On the 15th August, 1928, the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, in order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air recon naissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air base at Koweit in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of the 22nd August, 1928): ' The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds to the use of Koweit territory in connexion with air operations against the Akhwan, by which Koweit was not directly or immediately threatened. Having regard, however, to the treaty liability of His Majesty's Government for the protection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the Sheikh in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced, on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from'the- [9823] c 212 Resident .... so far as may be practicable, on each specific occasion, and subject to the further restriction that there shall be no question of establishing a permanent base in Koweit territory.' As the result of considerable lurtner interdepartmental discussion, the Air Officer Commanding was authorised on the -25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional reconnaissances over Koweit territory, both by air and car. ' His Majesty's Government are anxious, however, that— (1) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible, and (2) That the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsi bility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by His Majesty s Government, or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Air Officer Commanding in acting under the authority now given him.' (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 306, dated tha 25th September, 1928.) 3. Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh, of armoured cars in Koweit '' for protection of Iraqi tribes for so long a period as one month.' (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 76, dated the 23rd February, 1929.) 4. In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of Koweit in the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Saud in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur in the use, if necessary, of military force, the nature and extent of which should be determined by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, for the purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any part of Koweit territory. On the 8th May, 1929, the India Office, in a letter to the Colonial Office, remarked: 'Viscount Peel gathers that the attitude of the Sheikh is no longer in question and that he has already promised to endeavour to prevent refugees making use of Koweit territory. As regards the question of giving the Sheikh military assistance for this purpose, the Secretary of State remains of his previous opinion that it is undesirable to extend in any way the general liability hitherto accepted by His Majesty's Government for the defence of Koweit territory, if this can at all be avoided It would, on the whole, be preferable, if possible, to avoid asking the Sheikh to concur in the use of military force, but if . . . . such a request is still essential, he is prepared to agree that the Sheikh should be asked to concur ' The other Departments regarded it as essential to make a request in the sense referred to of the Sheikh and the necessary instructions were sent to the High Commissioner on the 11th May. 5. The view held as regards our liability for protection of Koweit during the operations of 1928-29 is perhaps best stated in the India Office letters of the 22nd August, 1928, and the 8th May, 1929, quoted in paragraphs 2 and 4 above. While our precise liability for protection was not investigated in any great detail, the course of action adopted in dealing with threats to Koweit territory appears to have been generally consistent with the construction of our liability suggested by Colonel Fowle in paragraph 10 of Bushire despatch No. 1365-S of the 25th October, 1933.(^ _ , _ pn J. G. LAITHWAITE. India Ojjice, February 6, 1934. ( l ) [N ote .—The paragraph referred to runs as follows The 1914 agreement states that in return for the Sheikh's co-operation against the Turks ' Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' This, unlike the phraseology of the previous agreements, is a most categorical assurance, and the word principality and not ' town ' being used, would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Koweit Sheikhdom on His Majesty's Government Personally, I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office note, that on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit as a whole.' It is true as pointed out in the note, paragraph 16 {d), that neither the present Sheikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this agreement to His Majesty's Government, but that hardly relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majestv's Govern- ment s obligations relieve the Sheikh completely oi the responsibility of his o™ defence. u ill f ? , C y be able to deal any small raids across his frontiers, and should only look for assistance from His Majesty's Government in the case of more serious xif' 21 was P resuma bly the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1926, when the Sheikh was encouraged to purchase half-a-dozen Ford vanettes, Lewis guns which were mounted in the vanettes, and ammunition, and when some of his men received training from the Eoyal Air Force as machine-gunners.']13 [E 7141/16/91] 2.— India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received November 22.) Sir, India Office, November 21, 1933. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to transmit to you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf respecting relations with Koweit. I am, &amp;c. S. F. STEWART. Enclosure in 2. • I*' * ' ''V v # ^ I Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to Secretary of State for India. {Confidential.) h* /£&gt;£$ ^ • Sir, Bushire, October 25, 1933. I HAVE the honour to refer to your letter dated the 13th October, 1933, enclosing a copy of the record of an interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 5th instant, note by Sir Andrew Ryan on Ibn Saud's attitude towards Koweit, and India Office provisional note, dated the 11th October, 1933, on the obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. I -discussed the matter with the Political Agent, Koweit, when I passed through there recently on my way to Bushire. 2. One of the two' questions (the other is dealt with below in paragraphs 7 and 8) discussed at the meeting was, briefly, whether, with a view to maintaining our control over Koweit, which was undoubtedly fast increasing in importance as a political and strategical centre in the Middle East, (a) it was advisable to declare a British protectorate over that sheikhdom, or (b) whether sufficient control could not be obtained over it by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the sheikh as opportunity offered by filling in the gaps which at present existed in our agreements with him. 3. As will be seen from the record, frima facie, I favoured (b) rather than («), and further reflection and my discussion with Colonel Dickson, who agrees with me, has confirmed me in that opinion. The objections to {a) are that, in our (i.e.. Colonel Dickson and my) opinion, a protectorate would most probably meet with considerable opposition from the sheikh, who, while valuing his British connexion, values equally highly his independence in the eyes of his fellow Arab rulers, and the outside world in general. The declaration of such a protectorate would likewise alarm the other sheikhs on the Arab coast of the Gulf. It might also involve His Majesty's Government in a measure of interference in the internal affairs of Koweit' which can at present be avoided. The question of slavery in Koweit, for example, as part of the slavery question in the Gulf generally, will doubtless be raised in the future by the recently established Permanent Slavery Committee of the League of Nations, and as we have no slave agreement with the ruler, such as exists with the other Arab rulers by which the local Political Agent can manumit slaves, the Koweit aspect of this problem offers special difficulties. So long as Koweit remains 'independent,' His Majesty's Government's responsibility in the matter is presumably limited to representations and persuasions to the sheikh. In the event, however, of a British protectorate being declared over the sheikhdom. His Majesty's Govern ment might possibly be committed to more drastic action. Finally, it is not improbable, though this is a matter outside my sphere, that the declaration of a Koweit protectorate might lead to somewhat awkward accusations from other Governments of 'land grabbing' and the like, with which we have been familiar enough in the past with regard to other areas. 4. An examination of the alternative policy (b) shows that, unsatisfactory as our present treaty relationship with the sheikh may be (as was pointed out at the meeting), we have a certain control over the ruler (see India Office note— Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit), and where our agreements show gaps, these can, to a large extent, be filled up. Thus, control of aviation through Koweit, whether military or civil, would be in the hands of His Majesty's Government under the proposed air agreement (videy u correspondence ending with India Office letter dated the 11th August, ^ the Government of India. Foreign and Political Department) with the sheikh, while the proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council {vide correspon dence ending with Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, express letter dated the 21st August, 1933, to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India) would place jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in Koweit in the hands of the Political Agent. 5. A third ''gap ' is the habit of direct correspondence which has grown up between the sheikh and Ibn Saud, and which was dealt with at some length at the meeting. The outcome of my discussion with Colonel Dickson on this point is as follows : There would appear to be two ways in which we can ensure control over this correspondence : — (1) By informing the sheikh that before despatching any official communi cation to Ibn Saud he should show it to the Political Agent, and should take similar action with communications received from Ibn Saud. This has been the sheikh's custom in the past, at any rate in regard to his outward correspondence; whether he has shown all Ibn Saud's official letters to Colonel Dickson, we do not r of course, know. After the sheikh had received our communication, which would,, of course, be tactfully worded and would merely ask him to continue the practice which he already observed, he would not be able to quote officially any letters which he had not shown to the Political Agent. If, for instance, in order to present His Majesty's Government with a fait accompli on some point agreed upon between Ibn Saud and himself, he should produce a communication which had not been seen by the Political Agent, we could ignore it. Both Colonel Dickson and 1 think that perhaps it would be better in our communication not to refer to any particular correspondence, but to treat the matter on general grounds. The above refers, of course, to official correspondence; nothing we can do will prevent cc private and personal ' letters passing between the two potentates. (2) The second alternative is to insist that official correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud should pass through His Majesty's Government's local representatives ; the Minister at Jedda, and the Political Agent, Koweit (or, perhaps, the Resident, Persian Gulf). This is already the procedure in force (at the sheikh's own request) in regard to the sheikh's correspondence with the Iraq Government, and so no new departure in principle would be involved. The advantage of this alternative would be its emphasis to Ibn Saud of the special relations that Koweit has with His Majesty's Government, which emphasis is apparently particularly needed at the present juncture {vide conclusion 1 of the meeting). As against this advantage, Colonel Dickson is of the opinion that the sheikh, who regards Ibn Saud, in spite of the latter's treatment of Koweit, in a somewhat different light to Iraq, might object more or less strongly to the proposal. J 6 Considering all the circumstances, I would suggest that I be authorised to instruct Colonel Dickson to approach the sheikh verballv on the following: lines : lhat His Majesty's Government have had it recently brought to their notice that Ibn Saud apparently harbours designs of trying to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him, similar—for instance-^to that of Asir • that it 18 § 0 tu a 1 j i ® P ractice direct correspondence between him—the sheikh and Ibn baud which has grown up of late, even though he—the sheikh—shows the correspondence to the Political Agent, has somewhat obscured in the eyes of Ibn baud the fact of Koweit s special relations of protection, &amp;c., with His Ma J est y s Government ; that it would put this correspondence on a safer and more regular footing, if it was conducted as was the correspondence with the Iraq Government, i.e., through His Majesty's Government's local representatives • that, m addition, an intimation to this effect to Ibn Saud would bring sharp v to his notice Koweit s relations with His Majesty's Government- and that finJllv His Majesty s Government would be glad to learn, confidentiaily and informallv what were his—the sheikh's—reactions to the proposal. miormarn, I trust I may be authorised to take this step as soon as possible and whP7i th* X'mto'Sd to k '' &gt;Wn 1 Wil1 m * ke » •« -bWi15 obligations to protect the interests of Koweit. The most important of these obligations, which are dealt with in the India Office note on the subject, and the one which in a sense determines any others there may be, is that of protection against hostile incursions or invasions. His Majesty's Government's agreements with the sheikh are three in number : that of January 1899, that of October 1907 and that of November 1914. 8. The agreement of 1899, as far as ' protection ' is concerned, in return for the good behaviour of the sheikh and his successors, merely promised '' ^he good offices''of His Majesty's Government, 'whatever that may mean' as Lord Lansdowne later remarked. Our construction of this agreement appears to have been the convenient one that we could choose the circumstances in which we need, or need not, protect Koweit in any particular crisis that arose, the exact area which we were responsible for defending being left more or less vague. 9. The agreement of 1907 merely confirmed from His Majesty's Govern ment that ' the town of Koweit and its boundaries ' belonged to the sheikh of that day and his successors. This agreement in no way added, in principle, to our nebulous responsibilities for the defence of Koweit, though, possibly, read with that of 1899, it might increase these responsibilities up to the 'boundaries/' 10. The 1914 agreement states that, in return for the sheikh's co-operation against the Turks, ' Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' This, unlike the phraseology of the previous agree ments, is a most categorical assurance, and the word ' principality,' and not 'town,' being used would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Koweit sheikhdom on His Majesty's Government. Personally, I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office note that 'on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit as a whole.' It is true, as pointed out in the note (paragraph 16 (d)), that neither the present sheikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this agreement to His Majesty's Government, but that hardly relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty s Government's obligations relieve the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence. The sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers, and should only look for assistance from His Majesty's Government in the case of more serious incursions. This, in fact, was presumably the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1928, when the sheikh was encouraged to purchase half a dozen Ford vanettes, Lewis guns which were mounted in the vanettes, and ammunition, and when some of his men received training from the Royal Air Force as machine gunners. 11. In conclusion, I venture to suggest that this question, the exact extent of the obligations of His Majesty's Government for the protection of Koweit, be investigated with a view to a definite decision on the subject. The question is an important one, and the advantages of having a clear conception of what our responsibilities may be in time of crisis, before such a crisis arises, are obvious. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and His Majesty's Minister at Jedda. I have, &amp;c. T. G. FOWLE, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. [e 7141/16/91] 3.— Mr. Johnstone to Mr. Laithwaite. My dear Laithwaite, Foreign Office, November 25, 1933. WITH reference to our telephone conversation yesterday, I write to confirm what I said to you about Ryan's views on the proposed instructions to Dickson, which are outlined in paragraph 6 of Fowle's official letter of the 25th October regarding Saudi-Koweit relations. On a cursory reading of that letter, Ryan concurred generally in the proposed instructions, except for the opening clause, which states that Ibn Saud intends to reduce Koweit to the same sort of position as Asir. In Ryan's view, it9 16 he spoke to you in the same sense, my higher authorities. Yours sincerely, KENNETH JOHNSTONE. [E 775/739/91] i i.—India Office to Foreign0#ce.—1.) g ir 1, 1934. 'j K I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he has had under his consideration the proceedings of the interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on Thursday, the 5th October, 1933, to discuss relations between His Maiesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit, and also the Political Resident's despatch of the 25th October, 1933, containing Colonel Fowle's recommendations on the tentative conclusions ot the meeting in question in the light of discussion of them with the Political Agent, Koweit 2. In the light of Colonel Eowle's views. Sir Samuel Hoare is definitely ot opinion that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not at present be further pursued, and he considers that it should be possible to ensure a sufficient degree of British control oyer the sheikhdom by adopting a policy ot tightening up our control over the sheikh as opportunity offers, by filling in gaps which at present exist in the agreements between the sheikh and His Majesty's Government. The gaps (with the exception of that discussed m the following paragraph and of a slavery agreement) are not, in fact, very serious. Apart from the major assurances contained in the agreement of 1899, the sheikh has already given undertakings in respect of the arms traffic; he is precluded from granting a pearling, sponge-fishing, or oil concession without the approval of His Maiesty's Government (though as regards oil the specific undertaking contained in the letter of the 27th October, 1913 (No. XLI on p. 264 of Volume XI of the 1929 edition of Aitchisoris Treaties), is by no means so clear as could be desired); the control of aviation, whether military or civil, in his State will pass to His Majesty's Government in the event of his accepting the proposals which the Resident has recently been instructed to make to him on this subject; while the proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council, once the sheikh's con currence in this has been obtained, will place the question of jurisdiction over non- Moslem foreigners in his State on a securer and more satisfactory basis. 3. The delicate question of the direct correspondence which has gradually established itself between the sheikh and Ibn Saud remains for consideration. Sir Samuel Hoare has considered the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of Colonel Fowle's despatch of the 25th October, and as a result he is of opinion, subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the first alternative suggested by the Resident (which incidentally is, apparently, likely to — prove the less objectionable to the sheikh) is the right solution. Subject to ^ Sir John Simon's concurrence, he would propose, however, to approve the Resident's recommendation that Colonel Dickson should approach the sheikh verbally on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 of Bushire despatch under con sideration, with the modification suggested in Mr. Johnstone's demi-official letter of the 25th November last to Mr. Laithwaite. Sir Samuel Hoare would also propose that it might be left to Colonel Fowle's discretion, after the sheikh's attitude has become known, to settle the matter in accordance with either of the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch. The important question whether special action should be taken to emphasise at Jedda to Ibn Saud the nature of the relations which exist between His Majesty's Government and the sheikh might be considered when a report has been received from Colonel Fowle. 4. The question of the obligations of His Majesty's Government for the protection of Koweit, to which the Resident refers in paragraphs 7-11 of his17 despateli, is one of considerable importance. The general position is examined in the India Office memorandum B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33, of which copies have already been communicated to the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State agrees with the Political Resident that the agreements of 1899 and 1907, containing as they do merely a promise of good offices, the applicability of which to the whole sheikhdom as distinct from the town of Koweit is open to doubt, are not of great material importance so far as 'protection' is concerned. The undertaking of real importance is that given to the sheikh in 1914 in return for the co-operation of his predecessor against the Turks. 5. Subject to Sir John Simon's views, Sir Samuel Hoare, on a consideration of the position as a whole, is in agreement with Colonel Fowle's view that the phraseology of this undertaking and the use of the word 'sheikhdom' and not town '' would appear to place definitely a responsibility for the protection of the whole principality of Koweit on His Majesty's Government. He is, at the same time, in entire agreement with the Resident that such an obligation, if His Majesty's Grovernment now formally confirm that they recognise its existence, cannot be regarded as relieving the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence, and that '' the sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers and should only look for assistance from His Majesty's Government in the case of more serious incursions.' Such a construction would, as Colonel Fowle suggests, be consistent with the attitude adopted by His Majesty's Government after the Akhwan operations of 1928-29, though it is relevant that no close examination of the precise obligations in the matter of His Majesty's Government was undertaken at that time. Should Sir John Simon share the views expressed in this paragraph. Sir Samuel Hoare will cause the Resident to be instructed accordingly. 6. While the Secretary of State, as stated above, would be opposed to the declaration of a protectorate, and is satisfied, as at present advised, that the desiderata of His Majesty's Government can be sufficiently secured by indirect tightening up of our control over the sheikh, he is at the same time impressed by the informal character of the engagements which have been entered into on behalf of Koweit. He would, therefore, be disposed to see advantage in consolidating the various undertakings which have from time to time been given on either side in a formal treaty on the lines of the Qatar Treaty of 1916, could this be secured without much difficulty. This would probably involve a reiteration and possibly a more formal specification by His Majesty's Government of their responsibility for protection of the principality of Koweit. Moreover, as stated in the India Office note B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33 on this subject, the assurances at present given to the sheikh are, in practice, renewed to each successor in return for his acceptance of the obligations, liability for which was accepted by his predecessors, and in 1918 it appears to have been held that our obligations held good only so long as the ruling sheikh on his side complied with his engagements. It is arguable that a formal treaty might place a heavier burden on His Majesty's Government with out correspondingly binding the sheikh. But it seems doubtful whether this view could, in fact, be sustained. Formal recognition by His Majesty's Government of a Sheikh of Koweit would presumably be necessary before the engagements entered into with previous sheikhs could be regarded as binding on either party. Any formal comprehensive treaty which might be drawn up could presumably be so framed as to make it clear that obligations were entirely reciprocal, and that the liability of His Majesty's Government held good only so long as they were satisfied with the performance by the sheikh of his obligations under the treaty. Finally, so far as protection is concerned, if the view suggested in paragraph 5 above is accepted, that a general liability (within the limits described) for the protection of the principality of Koweit as a whole must already be regarded as resting on His Majesty's Government, no material increase of their responsibilities would be involved in reiterating their acceptance of that liability in a formal treaty, while the mere fact of reiteration might make it easier to obtain the consent of the sheikh to a consolidating agreement. The Secretary of State would welcome Sir John Simon's views on this point. 7. Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State would suggest that, in view of the small margin of difference which appears to exist between the provisional recommendations of the inter departmental conference of the 5th October last, the recommendations of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the proposals in this letter, it will be [9823] d18 unnecessary, if those proposals commend themselves to Sir John Simon to refer the question for discussion to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee. Copies of the relevant papers might, however, once final instructions have been sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, be circulated for information to the other Departments represented on that committee. I am, &amp;c. J. C. WALTON. fE 775/739/91] &lt;5.—Foreign Office to India Office. Sir, Foreign Office, February 24, 1934. I AM directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request that you will lay before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare the following observations on India Office letter of the 1st February, regarding relations between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit. 2. Sir John Simon concurs in the view expressed in paragraph 2 of that letter that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not for the present be further pursued. 3. With regard to the question of direct correspondence between the sheikh and King Ibn Sand, Sir John Simon agrees that the sheikh should first be sounded orally in the sense suggested in paragraph 3 of your letter. He would, however, suggest that thereafter the Political Resident should report further which of the alternative courses of action discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch of the 25th October, 1933, he recommends, before adopting either, in order that His Majesty's Minister at Jedda may be given an opportunity of furnishing his observations. As at present advised. Sir John Simon is inclined to prefer the second alternative proposed by Colonel Fowle (viz., that all official correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud should pass exclusively through the Political Resident or Political Agent and his Majesty's representative at Jedda), as emphasising more strongly the special position of His Majesty's Government in Koweit, and placing a more effectual check upon Ibn Saud's attempts to strengthen his own position there to the detriment of that held by His Majesty's Government. This course would, in Sir John Simon's view, have the additional advantage that the influence of His Majesty's representative at Jedda could, when necessary, be more easily exerted upon the Saudi Government, if he were the actual channel of the sheikh's communications. 4. In any case, it appears that, were the first alternative adopted, it would not be sufficient simply to exercise a discreet control in Koweit over direct correspondence between King Ibn Saud and the sheikh. For, although the sheikh's side of the correspondence would be seen by the Political Agent, there would be no indication of this fact on the document which reached Ibn Saud. If, therefore, the sheikh were to send Ibn Saud a letter which the Political Agent had not seen and which His Majesty's Government wished to repudiate on that ground, they might find some difficulty in establishing with King Ibn Saud the fact that they were justified in doing so, since, so far as he could see, this letter would be no less authentic than others which he had exchanged with the sheikh, and which he had been tacitly led to consider perfectly in order. It would, therefore, in Sir John Simon's view, be necessary to add to those of the sheikh's letters which the Political Agent had seen and approved some indication of that fact. But such an arrangement would probably in the sheikh's eyes be as unwelcome a limitation on his official correspondence with Ibn Saud as the second alternative proposed by Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle. 5. It further appears to Sir John Simon that, since it is proposed in the first place, when sounding the sheikh orally, to suggest to him that air his official •correspondence with Ibn Saud should be conducted through His Majesty's local representatives, to fall back later on the first alternative proposed by Lieutenant- Colonel Fowle would represent a weakening on the part of His Majesty's Government, which on general grounds would be better avoided. 6. A final decision in the matter must, however, evidently depend upon the report furnished by Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle after the preliminarv oral approach to the sheikh. 7. As regards the obligations of His Majesty's Government in respect of the protection of Koweit, Sir John Simon agrees with the views expressed in paragraphs 4 and 5 of your letter under reply.19 8. He has also considered the proposal in paragraph 6 of that letter for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the sheikh, which should include inter alia the acceptance by His Majesty's Government of a general liability for the protection of the whole sheikhdom within the limits indicated in paragraph 10 of Colonel Fowle's despatch of the 25th October, referred to above. While agreeing that there would be advantage in such a treaty, Sir John Simon assumes that it is not proposed to undertake the negotiation of it immediately. Prima facie it seems inadvisable to raise a possibly controversial issue of such importance with the sheikh until the question of his relations with King Ibn Saud and that of the projected oil concession (which appears likely to indispose the sheikh, since he may lose financially by the elimination of competition between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the United States oil interests) have been disposed of. 9. As regards the possibility mentioned in paragraph 6 of your letter, that a formal treaty might be considered to place a heavier burden on His Majesty's Government than that which they at present bear in respect of Koweit, without correspondingly binding the sheikh, I am to observe that, in accordance with the construction which is usually placed upon treaties with heads of States, any formal treaty concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit would attach to Koweit as a State, and would apply automatically to the sheikh's successors. The under takings given by the two contracting parties to a treaty must certainly be construed as reciprocal. Sir John Simon notes, however, from statements made by the India Office representative at the meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 5th October to discuss this question, that it is considered that His Majesty's Government could and would remove a Sheikh of Koweit for hopeless misgovern- ment. He presumes, therefore, that His Majesty's Government could in practice prevent the accession of a ruler who seemed unlikely to observe his treaty obligations towards them, or could, at any rate, remove a ruler who after his accession in fact refused to observe those obligations. If this be so, there appears no ground for fearing that a situation might arise in which His Majesty's Government would be faced with the alternatives either of acquiescing in a refusal by the sheikh to recognise his treaty obligations or of putting an end to their treaty relations with Koweit. 10. Sir John Simon concurs in the view of Sir Samuel Hoare that it is unnecessary to refer this question to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee, but he assumes that copies of the relevant papers will be circulated later to the Departments represented thereupon.

Disposal of this question has been deferred pending a ^ decision on the matters discussed in the present letter, but steps are now being taken to deal with it as a matter of urgency. 7.

Major olmes, on behalf of the xomait Oil Company or some of his American friends, could not see his way to apply for an Oil Concession in the southern part of Iraq (Basra Liwa). 4. Pajor Holmes replied jokingly that neither he ncr any other self-respecting company wanted to have anything to do with the Basra area, as there was no sign of Oil there. 5. After some further 'Oil' 1 talk, Yusuf Ghanima turned to the question of the status of IZuwait, and conderaned in no uncertain terms the !t stupid obstinacy' of the Shaikh (Ghanima * s words) in his dealings with his well meaning 'mother state' of Iraq. He harped on the fact that the Shaikh was blind and could not see that Kuwait's interests were bound up with Iraq. ' r e next touched on fortunate political advantage ct which./which Iraq had gained for herself in having managed to get Kuwait Post &amp; Telegraph arrangements in her hands, and hoped that it would not be long before Iraq got a Railway line through to Kuwait, not be This last he regretted it could/put through at present, as money was ti 'it, but he hoped at some later date that it would be his good fortune to inaugurate a service, '/hen the ti e came for this however, he hoped and trusted that the Shailch would have got rid of some of his nonsensical ideas about independence and would have learnt n which side his bread was buttered on Tt . 7. Major Holmes said that he could not say why he was regaled with the above, but suspected that the game was to get him to do a little bit of T, propaganda Tt for Iraq with the Shaikh. What Major Holmes did not like however, was the contemptuous way with which the Finance Minister all the time referred to 'little Kuwait and her Shaikh' - As Major Holmes put it, 'Anyone hearing Mr.Yusuf Ghanima might easily have supposed that Kuwait was a miserable little village on the borders of Iraq and her Shaikh a petty chieftain with a lot of wind in the head'. 8.

The Heuidency, Busliire, tbe 5th ICarch 1956 p* / |v &lt; t Could you pleaee refer to Kyan •s letter to Rend el of the 4th February 1936, Ho,254/580/27, with ar enclosed Kote on the question of our cnntrol over the foreign relations of Kuwait, 2* Ryan agreed with me on the Immediate question of the desirafeility of Ilm Baud's visit to Kuwait, (and the visit itself was apparently a distinct succena - viae de Gaury 1 a s vl k » letter i}o # C-49 of the 7th February 1926, copy forwarded to India Office, iovernment of India and Jedda under my Printed letter lo # 112 -3 of the 12th February 1936), but T think understood my views as to this control in a soiaewhat broader sense than T had intended. These - jny view# - .vere given in a telegrari: (paragraph 1 of r^y ?lo.S^ of 29th January 1936 quoted by Flyau) am necessarily had to be given briefly. 5. The position as 1 see it is as follows. Our relations with the Arab Rulers are governed by certain treaties, those with Bahrain and the Trucial Shaikhs (including ^atrr) contain a specific provision th*t the Bhailchs concerned can have no c omauni cat i one with Foreign Rulers and therefore inferentially should not pay or receive visits without the sanction of His Majesty's Government. In the Kuwait Agreements, however, there is nothing to prevent communications between the Shaikh and Foreign Rulers, and therefore inferentially he can pay and receive visits without the sanction of His * j esty*s Government. 4. / Thft Hon 1 ble Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, KCIE .,Cr&gt;I .,MVO # , Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Hew Delhi.110 4, Ther-* is therefore a definite { -;ap in our Kuwait Agree- ments which we tried to fill up a couple of years ago# The result of this attempt its %iren in my latter Ko*58B-B of the 27th April 1934 to the India Office, (copy forw&amp;rded to Govern- raent of Ind ir and Kuwait under Printed Letter No«389-S of the same date), quoted by Ryan. The Shaikh reeled most unfavourably to the suggestion that official correspondence between him and Ibn Saud should pass through the hands of His Majesty's C-overnment*^ Represent at ivest the Minister at Jedda and the Political Agent at Kuwait. 5. *ut when I said that our control over the foreign relations of Kuwait differed, from that over those of the other Shaikhs all I meant was in regard to the particular i^i«w&gt;ii'TiirmT . - . ^ ' t point at issue i.e. communicati. ns with Foreign , ulers• Ixoept for this point the Shaikh of Kuwait 1 s position is \ i nil)—• ~ r ,. similar to that of the other Shaikhs. He is not allowed to receive the Representative of any Foreign Power, or to cede, sell, etc., etc. any portion of his territory to the govern ment or subjects of a foreign Power without the sanction of Hia Majesty^ Government (Aitchison P.O. Ho.XXXVI) or to import arms into, or export them from, Kuwait (ibid XXXYI1} or to grant an oil concession without sanction of His Majesty f s Government (Ibid XII). It will be seen therefore that under our Agreements we have a fairly close control over Kuwait in the matter of foreign relations and otherwise, and even with regard to communications we have the Shaikh's assurance given in paragraph 11 of Bickson 1 ® letter Ho.O125 of the 6th April 1934 (copy forwarded to India Office and Government of India under my Printed Letter H0.358-B of the 20th April 1954) to the effect that he (the Shaikh) showed all official corres pondence with Ibn Saud to the Political Agent. 6. /6. There is, however, the mentioned at the begimung of paragraph 4 above. 1 think an is right in ing (paragraph 4 of his liote) tha.t it v/as deciUed for the tima baing to drop the question of direct ooneepCi.aenee between the Shaikh of Kuwait and Ibn t'iauu laore on ^rounds of a^pediency than of law. On farther reflection, hcv/ercr, I do not see how we can pursue the question in law # If the prohibition with regard to coinrmni cat ions is not in ooj- Jk&amp;Tmment® m turally our Agreements | canrtot help us in this matter, and the fact that this prohibi- tion is contained in our treaties with the other SJiaikho makes the omission with regard to Kuwait all the more obvious. i rather doubt whether points (a) f (b) and (c) of paragraph 2 of Ryan 1 s Hot a get over this difficulty - at any rate so far as the Shaikh is concerned. 7. On the whole I think our control over the foreign relations of Kuwait is reasonably effective. tfe might, however, fill the gap referred to above by following up the suggestion made in paragraph 6 of my letter of 27th April 1934 quoted above modified by Warner*s suggestion contained in the last Ja^ paragraph of the Report on the Interdepartmental Committee on Kuwait affairs of 8th June 1954. vbat 1 suggest is that i should be authorised by His Majesty's Government to write to the Shaikh as follows s - ti'hat as ne will doubtless remember in April 1954 Colonel Dickson approached hi® on the subject of official correspondence between him and Mis Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and suggested that official correspondence between him and His Majesty should pass through His Majesty* s Government * s Representatives at Jedda and Kuwait respectively instead of direct as heretofore. mat he ~ the /-4- tlie ol&amp;i ikh - .vaa ttttwilli-ng to a&amp;ce** to tiiia for rari ous reasons, but aosured Colonel uickaon that all official corresyandenoe between him and ills Eajeaty, ^aetiier sent or received, was s&amp;osm to tue Political Agent, i'hat the result cf thic conversation was duly reported by ma to Hi3 Haj ee ty 1 s *07 er nutunt who reoeiTed nis - tiie :-ns i&lt;h 1 &lt;? - assurance with satisfaction, but did not pursue the matter further at the time as he was then engaged in certain oil questions, and tney did not wish to trouble him on a .matter which though of some importance ^as of no particular urgency. That they thought, however, it would be as .veil that there should be souse record « as between His Majesty's GoTermaent and the Shaikh - of the conversation in question, ana have therefore instructed me to write to Jsua gu? • bov e # 8. I think that this letter will fill the gap already referred to in a practical ajanner. It will remind the Shaikh of his assurance, in case he has forgotten about it, and will ensure that he acts up to it• If he fails to do so, ana correspondence of importance passes between him and ibn Saud which he does not show to the Political Agent, we shall be in a position to confront the Shaikh with his promise, and to consider any such communication as personal, of which we can re,fuse to take any official cogniaance. Ho communication on the subject of the letter should - for obvious reasons - be made to Ibn f^aud^ There is no need for the latter to know officially that his correspondence is shown by the Shaikh to the Political Agent (though unofficially he is apparently arell aware of it, vide paragraph 12 of Bickson's letterof 6tii ^prii 1934), and as Dicksoii* a appJ'oacb. to tiic. lihaikh was confidential the matter should be kept as eucii between the biiai kh and Hi a ^ ty 1 &amp; ov ex is&amp;txit • 9o I do not propose that the BUg^ut®d letter - if approved of by His ^ j eaty 1 k? Sovermrieut - should be »enc to the Shaikh forthwith c Oiiiing * oo ooon after i bn iiaad^ visit to Kuwait it might give a wrong impreaoiou, X would keep the letter by me ana choose some saita&amp;e opportunity, probably when visiting Kuwait at some time in the future, to give it to the r^ia^ich after an appropriate conversation.

At the same time I think that Sir Andrew Ryan's suggestion at the end of the record of the meeting that when the 'UlllWIIIIH I texts of the note? on the blockade quest Ion were agreed, but before they wereaactaily signed, that we should then tell the Shaikh that the question had arisen as to the proper form for the notes to takegi might well raise some difficulties. In the first place, it would mean a delay in the actual signing of the notes which the Saudi Government would not understand, and might lead to various complications* If the Shaikh rexused to accept our letter regarding our control over his foreign relations, I do not see now we could refuse to let the notes actually be singedc Moreover the Shaikh might convey the gist of our letter to Ibn Saud* 2o I think it would he preferable to return to the j | ' agtnepmmiiuiiiuiniumginmimm 4^^ suggestion ma^de in my demi-official letter No .

In view, ho?/ever, of the delicate state cf the Saudi Blockade negotiations, and the fact that I have no official cognizance of the correspondence, I think perhaps the best course would be either to ignore it for the momoit , or merely infom the liuler of Kuwait - without notifying the Saudi Arab Government - that you have no objection to it at the present time, if it facilitates minor business. 4.

Question of future policy in regard to Kuwait was recently discussed at an informal Interdepartmental meeting attended by Be Gaury. Meeting had before it memo randum prepared by Mr. Rendel in the light of his recent tour in which it was urged that the time has come to adopt a more forv/ard policy with the Shaikh and to consider how we can gradually strengthen control over hiip. E. After India Office representatives had made it clear that in their view best way of establishing influence with Shaikh was to obtain satisfaction for him in regard to his two outstanding grievances against His Majesty^ Government viz. i the date gardens and Saudi-Kuwait Blockade discussion centred on proposal put forward by Rendel that there should be some kind of shore naval establishment at Kuwait as an outward and visible sign of British influence. This was opposed by Admiralty representatives who thought that it Y /ould be suff icient if arrangements could be made for more frequent naval visits; but after considerable discussion it was eventually agreed that Admiralty should examine possibility of establishing simple recreational facilities for ratings on shore. 3.

The issue of the above has been duly authorised. 0iP. 3. 3212/37. XC 0 W E I T. Tiie question of our future policy in regard to Koweit is one of considerable difficulty and may reciuire an urgent solution, ^• Hitherto our policy has 'been mainly negative. Our chief conce rn has heen'' to''pr'evenIr^thT''absorption of Kmeit by either of its two powerful neighbours, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and to defend the interests of the Sheikh against those two countries to the best of our ability with the minimum of :3] interference in his internal affairs. We have also sought to prevent the penetration of any non-British foreign influence into .ii.GVvei u ana have sought to insist on our right to manage Kcweit's foreign relations S ) We have very carefully refrained from interfering in any way in the internal affairs of Koweit and have relied wholly on powers of■ peaceful persuasion to induce the bheiich to follow a reasonable policy.- We have not contemplated at any time attempting to coerce the Sheikh, and in fact no methods of coercion are at present available. To embark on a more forward or active policy would lead to a number of serious C l?f£ii^l ions and involve a complete departure from our traditions. A very strong case would therefore have to be made out if any such change of policy were to be contemplated. ^. On uhe other hand the situation is becoming increasingly unsatisfactory. It is admitted that Koweit could not maintain ics inuependent existence without our support. It has no hinterland of any importance, it has a very limited water supply (it depends largely on fresh water brought in dhows from the Shatt-el-Arab), and it has none, of the elements necessary to self—suiticiency or independence. It is no exaggeration therefore to say that it owes its continued independence solely bo the protection of His Majesty's Government. 4. The relations of Koweit both with Iraq and with Saudi Arabia are, however, extremely unsatisfactory. Difficulties are accumulating with both countries, owing tom ' ® the smuggling which undoubtedly takes place on a very large scale through Koweit into both Iraq and Saudi Arabia, The authorities in the Persian Gulf are naturally inclined to S8&amp; that it is the business of Iraq or Saudi Arabia to prevent this smuggling; that persons ana organisations in both those countries tend to benefit by it, if not actively co exploit it; that the Sheikh of ICoweit himself is innocent, and in no way bound to incur, for the sake of Iraq, or Arabia, the odium with his own subjects which any attempt on his part to stop smuggling would involve, while in any case Plis Majesty f s Government are not bound to take any strong steps in the matter, 5, All this is to some extent true, but the fact remains that the relations of His Majesty's G-cv ernment both with Iraq and Saudi Arabia are greatly complicated by the extreme tension which has developed between Koweit and those two countries. It is impossible for His Majesty 1 s Government to avoid some responsibility for this situation so long as they continue to control the foreign relations of K.oweit,and to protect Koweit against external attack, and the reaction of this situation on British imperial, interests in more important matters is beginning to prove most embarrassing. We therefore have a direct interest in doing whatever may be possible to bring the present unsatisfactory situation to an end, and to bring about a real improvement in relations between ICovveit on the one hand and Saudi Arabia and Iraq, on the other. But it is extremely doubtful whether it is physically possible for us to do this if our present policy in regard to Kc^/eit continues unchanged. 6, There ismother aspect of Anglo-Koweiti relations which is of even greater importance. The future of Iraq is most uncertain. The present Iraqi Government is weak and somewhat unreliable, and dependent to a much greater extent than is at all healthy on the good will of military leaders.-i-iie ,j(X oibili ty cannot be excluded of serious trouble Dreaking out in Iraq and of our position in that country being much imped red. I t lias for lon g been a principle of our Middle Eastern policy that we shoul d have air bases a Ad free ai7 transit through the Middle Sast, and it was, in fact, largely, that the Anglo-Iraqi allian ce was negotiated, it is legitimate to question whether that alliance can now be relied upon quite so confidently as when it was first concluded. With this increasing uncertainty in Iraq, it is for consideration •whether it might not be a prudent form of insurance to try to strengthen our position in some neighbouring territory which 'J-ont, in an emergency, serve as some kind of alternative. The only territory where this would be at all possible ia that of Koweit. r /. Again our relations with Persia are still far from 'bt-ixig regularised. We depend to a very great extent on s outhernPersia for our oil suppl ies. it is most unlikely that we shall ever need to use force in order to maintain the o&lt;j,ie bj o± our oil supplies. But the possibility of a situation arising where it might be of great value'to us to have a good base in this area under comp lete British control cannot be altogether esoluded; aid here again Koweit seems to offer the only possibility, 8. Lastly it is of trie utmost importance to us from the imperial strategic point of view - and incidentally also in view of the new oil resources which appear to exist in Koweit - that n o other £°Ji er sh0 Jld est ablish itself in Kowcit, and that Koweit should remain definitely under British control. But the time has passed when such a situation can be secured by purely negative meansj if we really wish to keep other people out we must inevitably step in and assume more direct responsibility ourselves. ghe same prob lem has arisen in Bahrein and the Trucial States and in the Aden Protectorate, In all theseI Ccses, the si'tua'bion. would 'be simple and safe if we were prepared to assume control and responsibility; while it is confused and precarious so long as our attitude is mainly negative and aloof, l 1 he problem which has arisen elsewhere now seems to be arising in Koweit and it is submitted that the sooner it is frankly faced, the better, 9, The special difficulties of assuming greater control in -vowexz are well iaiown. Apart from obvious geographical factors, they arise to some extent both from the failings and from the good qualities of the character of the Sheikh himself. His .Excellency's present policy seems to be to play off the' British, the Iraqis and the Saudis against each other, and to maintain his independence and prosperity by a precarious equilibrium of the three. The fact that Br itish oil interests allowed an Americal oil company to 00taints0 large a share in e xploiting the oil possibilities of Z07 eit has considerably strengthened the Sheikh's hands, and he is quite clever and capable enough to make full use of every advantage which the situation gives him. Should oil be discovered in commercial quantities in the near future - as seems possible •• the Sheil-h is likely to be able still further to strengthen his position and to accumulate still greater resources which he will be able to use against our interests, 10, It is therefore submitted that the time has come to adopt a more forward policy with the Sheikh of Kcweit, and to consider how. we can gradually strengthen our control over him. The ideal first step would be the establishment of a British p01 i11 cai advise'rship, corresponding to that exercised by Mr»Belgrave at Bahrein, It will, however, take a long time to get the Sheikh of Kbweit to agree to this, and, before anything of the kind can be pressed 'successfully, it will be necessary for us to strengthen our physical position in his principality.a • (i sflx I oH 11. It is submitted that this could he rendered much easier if we could establish in Koweit, naval and air sta tion s even of a more or less skeleton type* It is admitted that suoii stations are not at present necessary for purely naval or military reasons; that bases at Basra and Bahrein are all that is for the moment recruired* and that the establishment of a neT base at Koweit would have to be justified by political rather than by technical considerations* It is submitted, however, that political reasons are so strong that the establishment at any rate of skeleton bases would be more than justified, and that even from the strictly Service point of view, the uncertainty of the future situation in neighbouring countries would give an important insurance value to the establishment of such bases which would justify the comparatively small expenditure involved. 12. Unfortunately hitherto the question of the establishment of an air or naval, base at Koweit seems to have been considered purely from the point of view of the immediate Service requirements of the situation. It is understood that the Air Ministry have already decided, against the acquisition of land for an aerodrome, while the navy are naturally in no hurry to establish a new naval station at Koweit, which is too close zo Basra and possesses too little in the way of amenities, to offer much attraction from the service point of view. 13. (There is, however, a place immediately to the west of the town of Koweit where it is understood that two or three ■ sloops could find a satisfactory anchorage and where a small naval station with the necessary amenities could still be built. Land moreoever appears still to be available where an aerodrome with the necessary buildings could be established even if the installation were not completed for the present. It seems probable that the Sheikh, if he were tactfully approached, would raise no objection to these proposals, particularly as he professes the greatest friendship and admiration for the British^ - ur e. ® ITaYy and Air Force # It is submitted that the establisimient of nc,val and air bases would very greatly strengthen our physical P o c i tion in Koweit and make it far easier to develop a forward policy in other matters later on. 14, The precise methods, hov^ever, by which a more loi'waid policy could be adopted would need to be vi/orked out in consultation with the local authorities. What is important is an early decision on the princijole of strengthening our po&amp;iuion in Koweit, and of aiming at increasing our control, and taking an increasing amount of direct responsibility for Koweit affairs.. as EAS TEffi miFAmmm, FOREIGN OFFICE. May 10, 1937.A ^&gt;' no , 5t 7 © Koweit♦ Final record of inforiual interdepartmental meeting heia in Mr. Rendel's room in the Foreign Office at 3.30 p.m. on the 18th May. part of the discussion) Mr. Rumhold Mr. Symon Mr. Seal ) Mr. Rendel (in*the Qhelr) ) Mr. E. Warner j Mr. Walton (during the first Foreign Office India Office Admiralty Major G.W.M. Grover ; Squadron-Leader Jope-Slade, Air Ministry. Colonel Osborne, War Office. Captain de Gaury, Political Agent, Koweit. —Rendel explained that the meeting had 'been called in accordance with the arrangements outlined in his letters of the 13th May to Mr. Glauson, Group-Captain Pirie, Mr. Seal and Colonel Osborne (E 2606/2606/91), for the purpose of having a preliminary and entirely informal discussion about the situation in Koweit. He had been much struck in the course of his recent journey in the Middle East by the unsatislactory position in regard to Koweit. Koweiti problems were it seemed to him poisoning our relations both with Iraq and with Saudi Arabia. On his passage through Iraq., everyone had spoken to him with great bitterness on the subject, while in Saudi Arabia feeling seemed to run almost equally high. The extent of our responsibility for Koweiti affairs was vague and uncertain, but the reaction of those affairs on our own relations with neighbouring countries was/MX M I 0 / © was serious. He had outlined his preliminary views on the question in a memorandum which had already heen circulated to those present at the meeting, 'but he wished to make it clear that that memorandum had only 'been intended to serve as a basis for discussion. Mr. Walton agreed that the meeting might 'be useful, 'but wished again to stress its informal character. We should have in the first instance to consult the Political Resident on any proposals. Mr. Rendel's memorandum illustrated the differences 'between the Foreign Office and the India Office view. The India Office would like to strengthen our relations with Koweit and also the position of Koweit itself vis-a- vis its powerful neighbours. The Foreign Office stressed the desirability of strengthening British control. This was possibly a desirable object, but perhaps the Foreign Office did not attach enough importance to the psychological factor, namely the point of view of the Sheikh himself. He had two important grievances against His Majesty's Government. The first of these was that in 1914 His Majesty's Government had given an undertaking of the nature of a treaty that he should continue to enjoy his date gardens in Iraq. Since the Iraqi Government had been in control His Majesty's Government had been unable to implement that undertaking. In the second place, about ten years ago. His Majesty's Government had promised their good offices in persuading King Ibn Saud to raise the blockade. They had been unable to do so. Mr. Walton felt that if anything v/as to be done with the Sheikh every effort should first be made to remove these grievances. He was in favour of strengthening our position in Koweit, but he did not think that this object was likely to be achieved by adopting a bullying attitude. With regard to Mr. Rendel's suggestion for/for an air 'base and a naval 'base in Koweit, the India Office, if such steps were practicalole and su'bject to the views of the Political Resident, would regard these prima ft 1 G ^ as welcome, since they would 'bring money into the country, Mr. Rendel thought that there was not necessarily any very great difference 'between the India Office and Foreign Office views. The Foreign Office were fully alive to the importance of removing the Sheikh 1 s grievances, and had in fact for years 'been making every possible effort to do so. But the main difficulty still seemed to 'be the inadequacy of the control we exercised over the Sheikh. At present the only sign of our influence at Koweit was the Agency 'building, outside the town on its seaward side. On the inland side there was nothing to show that Koweit was in any way separate or distinct from Saudi Arabia or Iraq. What was wanted was some outward and visible sign of British influence, to emphasise the fact that Koweit was essentially separate and independent from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and under British protection. It was really a case of showing the flag. From the technical point of view there might be no need for a new naval base at Koweit, but for general political reasons, and for reasons of wider strategy, the establishment of some kind of naval station there might be of great value. Ap^rt from the psychological effect, it would give us a means of strengthening and increasing our influence at any moment at Y/hich it should be desirable to do so, without making any obvious new departure. MEj : Sozl admitted that Koweit might be strategically important, but it was a for cry from this to say that the building of a naval base was justified. Mr. Rendel said that all that was required was a small *■ ' flaa '' ea *^—ihtriminminwiw i 1 affair/ir Gout'.-west of the town, flying the flag, and provided with a canteen and a caretaker. The establishment should 'be in an ohvious place. Mr. Seal did not think that the Admiralty would like this at all. Where, he asked, would it lead to? There would have to he similar establishments in many other places. It would all he most expensive. Mr. Rendel indicated some of the difficulties involved in any other course. It was unlikely that we should meet with any success if we urged the Sheikh to accept any British political adviser like Mr. Belgrave at Bahrein. The Sheikh, however, had a great affection and admiration for the British Navy and would he much less likely to raise objection to the establishment of a naval station in his territory# Mr. Rendel suggested that full use ought to be made of this circumstance. Ma.jor Grover asked whether this object could not be fulfilled by more frequent naval visits to Koweit. Mr. Rendel and Captain de G-aury pointed out that this would not achieve the same purpose. What was required was the frequent presence of British sailors on shore. At present there were no facilities for the men from His Majesty's sloops to land at Koweit. If, however, certain amenities could be set up for them, e.g. a canteen and a football ground, the men could land frequently, they would become a familiar sight in the bazaars, and the psychological effect would be considerable. It would in fact go a long way to make it plain that His Majesty's Government took a direct interest in Koweit, and would not tolerate any foreign interference there. This was not plain at present to the mass of the population, even though the Sheikh and certain foreign Governments might be aware of it. Mr. Walton suggested that the best way of establishing our/i w a © our influence with the Sheikh would 'be to obtain satisfaction for hin over the date gardens and over the Saudi 'blockade. Mr. Rendel reminded the meeting of some of the overwhelming difficulties which had been encountered in the way of obtaining a settlement of these two questions. Unfortunately, owing to the mistakes of our predecessors, we were on extremely weak ground over the date gardens question, which had been badly compromised in 1924, when it had been omitted from the list of international obligations taken over by Iraq. As regards the Saudi blockade, we had no means of forcing the Saudi Government to reopen trade with Koweit, while the Saudi suspicions had a good deal of excuse. Mr. Walton said that, however weak our ground might be 3Ll§~i.~vis Iract over the date gardens, it was up to His Majesty's Government to keep their promise to the Sheikh. Mr. Rendel sSid that he did not dispute this, but pointed out that the cost involved might be enormous, and that the Treasury were the department primarily concerned. In any case, whenever efforts were made to obtain a satisfactory settlement from the Iraqis they always retorted by referring to the question of smuggling. Whoever was ultimately responsible for the smuggling, there was no doubt that the Koweitis did very well out of it. Mr. Walton said that we had been informed that the smugglers were Iraqis (Captain de Gaury confirmed that this is so). Surely it was for the Iraqis to take whatever steps they thought proper to deal with their own nationals, and if they were unwilling or unable to do so, it was unfair to put the whole onus on the Sheikh of Koweit. Mr. Rendel replied that the Iraqi Government were in a difficult position, as they were a weak Government without much authority. They could of course blockade Koweit, but/l3ut that would hardly 'bring alDout a solution. Mr&gt; Walton suggested that a solution could 'best 'be sought 'by co-operation 'between the Governments of Iraq_ and Koweit. The Sheikh as a result of his visit to this country in 1935.had already agreed to certain steps® In reply to a question from Mr. Seal ? Mr. Rendel pointed out that it was much easier for Saudi Arabia to 'blockade Koweit than for Iraq. The nearest Saudi Arabian markets for smuggled goods were hundreds of miles away across difficult deserts, hut there were many places in Iraq where smuggled goods could he sold, e .g. Zubair, Basra, Nejef, Kerhela etc., all of which were moderately accessible. In his opinion, smuggling could only 'be checked with the willing cooperation of the Sheikh, or with the assistance of British administrative advisers. But whatever was done about the smuggling, it seemed clear that a closer British control over Koweiti affairs was required. The discussion then reverted to the question of the proposed naval station. The alternatives appeared to be (l) the establishment of a regular fortified naval base, (2) the establishment of a small station consisting mainly of a canteen and recreation ground, and (3) more frequent visits of His Majesty's sloops without any increased shore facilities. Mr. Rendel pointed out that he had never intended to 'iftWlfWiiii .. I, T iTiii iiii i iiin i rii iiuijinnfinrfnn.Vnfli -n r m -mir 1 ifir iri^ rifnoMirMfif^miTTffnr suggest alternative (l). If alternative (2) were adopted (l) could no doubt te developed later on if this were found necessary. But he entirely agreed that it was unnecessary and would be unduly expensive at present. As regards alternative (3) Captain de Gaury pointed out/out that it would have no advantage over the present situation, since there were no facilities for men to land. What was required was the familiarisation of the inhabitants of Koweit with the sight of British sailors, etc. . It was agreed that in these circumstances the most useful alternative appeared to 'be (2) and Mr. Rendel and Captain de G-aurv 'both strongly supported, this, emphasising the psychological and political advantages which might follow from it. The Admiralty representatives, however, were not convinced and asked for time to consider the matter further. The question was then considered of how far there was in fact any real danger of the Sheikh of Koweit accepting the overlordship of Saudi Arabia or Tract, and shaking himself from British influence. Mr. Rendel pointed out that our treaty relationship with the Sheikh was at present vague and uncertain. There was no clear and comprehensive treaty binding him to the British connexion, and we might find ourselves on very poor legal ground for objecting if he were to confront us with a fait accompli . Mr. Rendel considered that it was by no means impossible that the Sheikh might negotiate a secret agreement with Ibn Saud, accepting Saudi suzereignty but retaining a large measure of autonomy. While Ibn Saud was unlikely to fall in with such a suggestion at present, he might easily do so if matters went wrong in Palestine and Anglo-Saudi relations were to deteriorate. Were we to be confronted with such a treaty, our position would be very difficult, and it might be practically impossible to recover our position in Koweit without the use of force or without quarrelling with Ibn Saud. Colonel Osborne asked whether it was really essential that/© that we should maintain our position in Koweit at all. Mr. Rendel replied that the whole discussion Hitherto had proceeded on the assumption that we could not afford to abandon Koweit or to allow any other power to occupy It. This had been an old established principle of British policy and had even led to acute controversy with Germany before the War. If, however, the War Office wished to call this principle in question, perhaps the best plan would be to refer the matter to Chiefs of Staff Committee as had been done in the case of the Yemen, so tnat we might be sure that we were working on sound premises. a premise of the argument hitherto had been that it was essential tnat we should maintain our position in Koweit. Mr. Eumbold said that he doubted whether a reference to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee would carry us further. Whatever the decision on the strategic aspect of the question it was essential that we should maintain our position in Koweit for political reasons. We could not allow Saudi Arabia or Iraq to absorb Koweit because of the reactions of any such event on the attitude towards us of our other Arabian protected states in the Gulf. If we abandoned Koweit our position in Bahrein, Qatar, and the Trucial coast was likely to be seriously weakened. Mr. Rendel further pointed out that we were already committed to protect Koweit by land. Further if oil were found in paying quantities in Koweit, as now seemed probable, it seemed of great importance that we should maintain our hold on the principality, since it might prove a most important source of oil for the British Navy in time of war, particularly if anything were to go wrong in Southern/Southern Persiao Squadron-Leader Jope Slade asked what Mr. Rende} had in mind when he suggested the establishment of an air 'base in Koweit. Mr. Rendel replied that what he contemplated was something corresponding to the proposed naval station - i.e. an aerodrome and a few sheds with a canteen and a petrol store. He did not contemplate a fortified 'base, hut some kind of station which could he developed if necessary, and which would give us a right to he there and enable us to ghow the flag. From the strategic point of view it seemed that it might he very useful to maintain an air station at Koweit so as to insure against trouble in Iraq,. Although the range of aircraft was no doubt becoming longer, and Koweit might perhaps not be easily defensible if a definite attack were launched against us in Iraq., it might nevertheless be very useful to have an air station under entirely British control at this point on the route to India, if at any time serious internal disorder were to break out in Iraqt, or the security of our normal communications were otherwise threatened. For example, landing and refuelling facilities in Iraq, might easily become precarious, while in Koweit we were free to establish a station under our complete and permanent control where we should be able to take our own steps to maintain order and security in case of need. Mr. Seal reverting to the question of the proposed naval establishment said that he did not see that this would affect the situation. What mattered in his view was our prestige in the East. If our position were strong the She ikh/Sheikh would 'be loyal to his British connexion in any case, while if it were weak the naval station would not make any difference, Mr, Rendel replied that, although our international prestige was an important factor, the actual presence of in ii I, British sailors on Koweiti soil would proloably make a more direct appeal to the population of the principality. Moreover, it seemed to him that the situation might easily he a very evenly 'balanced one where a very small factor might tip the scale. At present there was practically nothing to show our authority in Koweit, We could not, in his view, hope to maintain our position there against the various risks which threatened it with so small and inadequate an establishment. —Seal suggested that the proper way to ensure our position in Koweit was to make it clear to the Sheikh that we were strong, and that we would not stand any nonsense. His view was that it was a 'bad mistake to try and run 'backward areas such as the Gulf on League of Nations t principles. Mr. Rendel pointed out that Koweit - unlike the Persian Islands in the Persian Gulf was a place where we had a legal claim to establish ourselves. We could now establish ourselves there without violating any international principle, and quite consistently with our general policy.

The places I visited and the personalities I met were so many and so diverse that it has been impossible to make the report as short as I could have wished. But I have divided it into sections under separate headings, of which a contents list is prefixed above, in the hope of making it easier for those who have no time for the whole of so bulky a document, to pick out any parts of it likely to be of interest to them. The aecount of our trip across Arabia and visit to Jedda will be found in paragraphs 58 to 126. Much of the rest is of less general interest, but I have thought it well to make the narrative complete,, as the trip was unusual, and a full record of it may be useful for future reference. IN TRODUCTORY . 2. Soon after the Amir Saud's visit to England in the summer of 1935, I received, through the Saudi Minister in London, an invitation from King Ibn Saud to visit Riyadh, with my wife, and to cross 3audi Arabia from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. Owing to the Abyssinian crisis, it proved impossible to accept this invitation at the time, but, on its being renewed last autumn...... To the Right Honourable Anthony Eden,M„C.,M.P., etc., etc., etc.,zol 5. autumn, I was able to obtain sanction to undertake the journey early this year. My time was necessarily limited, but I was nevertheless able to see a great deal, and to have many interest ing conversations, not only with the British representatives in th countries I visited, but also with prominent local personalities, and particularly ¥/ith King Ibn Saud himself. Although I was careful, in accordance with the instructions I had received, to make it clear in every case that these conversations were en tirely private and unofficial, I hope that they may still have served some useful purpose. They have certainly been of the greatest value to me. OUTWARD JOURNEY 8 I left England with my wife on February 9th and travelled overland to Brindisi, and thence by the Lloyd Triestino direct service via Cyprus to Haifa. From Haifa we travelled by Nairn Gar, past the beautiful Vale of SdraeIon,through the hills of (jalilee, scarlet with anemones, down to Tiberias, and round the back of Mount Hermon by a rather dull Syrian road to Damascus, In order not to overload this report I am submitting separate notes (i) on my visit to Cyprus, where we were most kindly received by the Governor and the District Commissioner of Larnaca; (ii) on my various experiences of Italian shipping lines and their connexion with the development of Italian in fluence in the Middle East; (iii) on the impressions I derived from my hurried passage through Palestine; and (iv) on the Nairn Convoy Service from the Mediterranean to Bagdad, v DAMASCUic»..DAMSCU3. 4, We arrived at Damascus on February 15th. Plis Majesty's Consul-General, Colonel MacKereth and his-wife, who both seem deservedly popular in Damascus society, entertained us to tea., I also met an old acquaintance, Major Longrigg, of Petroleum Concessions Limited, whom I found much depressed over his oil negotiations with the new Syrian Government, The details of these have been fully reported elsewhere, and I only mention them as they were frequently quoted to me as a typical example of the incompetence and muddle-headedness of the new native Syrian Governnient, who apparently were unable to make up their minds on any point, and had only the haziest idea of what they wanted, or of what it might be practicable to obtain. The French authori ties, who are equally interested with ourselves in getting this business settled, seemed no less despondent about it. 5 e While I was at Geneva in January M. Vienot, the French Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, had specially asked me to try to get into direct touch with the French High Commissioner when I passed throu'gh Syria, and do anything I could to make sure that there was the closest possible co operation between the British and French authorities in any countries I might visit in the Middle East. My wife and I were therefore very glad to accept an invitation to dinner that evening with Comte de Martel, who v/as paying a brief visit to Damascus.. Colonel and Mrs, MacKereth were also invited, and the party included the French delegate for Damascus and his wife, and various members of the High Commissioner's staff. As this . is a frank and confidential record I may say at once that I found0 1o 3 5 0 Mo de Martel uninspiring e He made few efforts to initiate conversation and we all found him heavy going. He struck me as a man who had lost interest in his joh since his own policy had been overridden and that of the hastily concluded Franco- Syrian Treaty imposed on him insteado He spoke with bitterness of the pretensions of the 'Turks and the weakness of the French Government over Alexandretta ? but had little to say about the future of Syria. 6 e Bearing M, Vienot T s remarks in mind, I took the opportunity of a private talk with M 0 de Martel to ask whether he was entirely satisfied with the amount of co-operation he was receiving from the various British authorities with whom he had to deal. He said he was 9 qualifying this affirmative^ however, with a mild exception in regard to Captain G-lubb in Trans jordan, whom he accused of tampering with the allegiance of Syrian tribes. This is an old mare's-nest, and I did my best - quoting my personal knowledge of Captain Glubb T s character and activities - to allay these suspicions^ which I believe to be quite unfounded, Comte de Martel was anxious to get into personal touch with Sir A e Clark Kerr, but had apparently - in view of misunderstandings in the past with the former British authorities in Iraq - hesitated to take any steps to bring about a meeting, I promised to take the matter up in Bagdad and duly did so, and when I left Iraq Sir Ac Clark Kerr was already corresponsing with Comte de Martel through the French Minister at Bagdad about a possible meetings 80 o . . 0 * This meeting has since taken place.6. 8» The track from Damascus to Bagdad has been much improved of late, and we had a comfortable journey via Rutba where we dined, arriving at Bagdad at 6,50 on the morning of February 17, BAG -D A D . 9e Our first day in Bagdad was marred by a dust-storm - the first ? I was told, for some weeks. It is difficult to describe the discomfort of these frequent afflictions, which are one of the greatest drawbacks of Bagdad as a posto The atmosphere not only looks like a London fog, but chokes and suffocates one even indoors„ Everything is rapidly covered with a layer of foul and gritty dust. No amount of cleaning removes its traces, and the vegetation and buildings of Bagdai in contrast to those of Cairo - always bear a dusty and slightly sordid look in consequence. 10o Soon after my arrival I was asked by Sir A. Clark Ker to take part in a aeries of informal conversations about outstanding questions with him, Captain Holt (the oriental •Secretary to His Majesty's Embassy) and Mr. Co J. Edmonds (the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior). The results of most of these conversations have been recorded separately. We discussed in particular the question of the Perso-Iraqi frontier, and I was able to explain to 3ir A.Clark Kerr and Mr. Edmonds the results of the latest interdepartmental discussions in London. Sir A. Clark Kerr gave me a number of sidelights on, the local aspect of the problem which I have found of great value. Before I left Bagdad I also had..o.7c had some useful talk on this question with Mr, MacDougall, the Legal Adviser to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 11a Another question which came up for discussion ¥/as that 0: ^ ^ owe ^^i ra Q .'l relations, v/ith particular reference to the problem of smuggli ngs Sir A. Clark Kerr gave me a clear and complete picture of the Iraqi aspect of this complicated question^ and asked me to do what I could to clear up certain misconceptions under which the authorities in the Persian G-ulf seemed to be labouring in regard to it. I later took this up at Koweit and Bushire and reported the results to Sir A,Clark Kerr in letters copies of which have been entered separately. I am inclined to think, however, that the problem of Koweit is too complex for purely local settlement. I am submitting a separate note on this question (see also paragraphs 29 and 30 below)o Meanwhile, I was able, while I was at Bagdad, to explain to Sir A. Clark Kerr the peculiar nature of the dif ficulties with which we are faced in dealing with Koweit, and I think he realised that it was not practical politics to bring about what might be called the ideal Iraqi solution. Later Captain Holt and I also talked over certain aspects of the Assyrian question, and I explained certain aspects of the problem on lines which had been previously agreed upon at home, I have dealt with these conversations in a separate note. 12. On the evening of February 17th Sir A e Clark Kerr gave a men T s dinner-party of 27 at the Embassy to enable me to meet the Prime Minister, Hikmat Beg Suleiman, and other members of the« «o.*o .... y 8. the Iraqi Government. The Embassy staff and most of the British Aclvioors to the Iraqi Government t many of whom I already knewr, were also invited, it the Ambassador's suggestion, I had a long informal talk with the Prime Minister after dinner, for which Captain Holt acted as interpreted. I later prepared for Sii A. Clark Kerf a separate note of this conversation, of which a copy is being entered separately so that I need not record it again here, 13. My general impression of the Prime Minister was that his intentions were admirable and that he was genuinely anxious to stand well with us. He struck me as more cultivated and intelligent than I had expected, and I should imagime him capable of aiming quite sincerely at a policy of moderate and en lightened reform. But,, while I entirely agree with Sir A. Clark Kerr's view that it is most desirable for Iraq that the present Government should remain in power for some years at least, I confess that Hikmat Bey gave me personally little impression of force of character. I distrust first impressions, but my own, for what it is worth, was of a man coping with a task on rather too big a scale for him, and also a little too anxious to give explanations of the motives of his policy, - explanations which, in one or two cases at any rate - notably that of the alleged Iraqi fear of attack from Persia - I lound somewhat unconvincing, 14. On the evening of February 18th Dr. Naji el Asil, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, gave a dinner for me at the new Town Hall, attended by some 50 guests, including members oflis a® 7 9 0 of the Iraqi G-cvernment^ the senior officials of the Iraqi Government departments and the Embassy staff. On this occasion Sir A. Clark Kerr and I had a long conversation with Dn Naji ? who speaks good English,, I recorded the substance of the more important parts of this conversation in a separate memorandum which I gave to Sir A, Clark Kerr and of which he has since sent home a copy in his despatch NOo77 of February 19th, 15, Dr 0 Naji struck me as having gained much in confidence and personality since the remote days when he used to sit - as the discarded and discredited unofficial agent in London of the late King Hussein of the Hejaz - outside the doors of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office* But he still seems to me a light weight - though he is pleasant and friendly I fear he carries little conviction in Saudi Arabia where the Arabs I met spoke slightingly of him, but possibly this may be due to prejudice against his past, 16, Some of the other members of the Cabinet - notably the Minister of Education, with whom I had a longish talk at the Iraqi dinner - struck me as intelligent and capable. But although my visit to Bagdad has certainly made me readier than I was before to believe in the new Iraqi Government 1 s good will I cannot say that it has much increased my confidence in their ability to stay the course, 17, With the Ambassador's approval I had some interesting talk with one or two of the local Christian authorities regarding,...,0 10, regarding the position of the Assyrians on the Khabur and of the Christian minorities in Iraq.. The general conclusion of these talks was somewhat depressing^ but in order not to overload the present report unduly I am recording their substance in a separate notec 18o Before leaving Bagdad I attended a tea party given by the Saudi Charge d t Affaires, Ibrahim Ibn Muammer (whose pro-Saudi intrigues have apparently aroused the resentment of the Iraqi Government), and met various other foreign representatives, including the Egyptian, German^ Italian and (later) French MinistersI thought the Egyptian intelligent and interesting, the German rather assertive, the Italian frothy, and the Frenchman extremely well- disposed and well intentioned, but inclined to be a little fussy and ridiculous. Nothing passed of sufficient interest to be worth special mention. B asra ma skatt el arab. 19 8 We left Bagdad on the evening of February 19th in a saloon carriage kindly put at our disposal by the Iraqi Railways at the request of the Iraqi Government, and were met at Basra the next morning by Colonel Ward, the Director of the Port of Basra and now also of the Iraqi Railways, who is an old friend of mine, 20e Colonel Ward, in whose house we stayed, and ¥rtiose unflagging drive and efficiency are a perpetual wonder to me ? began by showing us over his new airport at Maqil - a magnificent piece of work, ofswhich he is justly proud. Full particulars of, .0011. of this are no doubt available elsewhere, so I will only say that it struck me - except for certain very minor drawbacks, sucn as the small size of some of the bedroom windows and of the bedrooms themselves - as a first class organisation, conceived on a large scale with a clear eye to future needs, for both land and sea aviation. The cost is being met f 1 understand, from the revenues of the Port of Basra, and it is expected that it will almost immediately become self-supporting. The total cost of the whole place including the buildings appears to be about four-fifths of what has been estimated for the erection of the proposed new Residency at Bahrain. 1 21. Colonel Ward then took us, with breathless speed, in one of his new fast launches, down the Shatt-el-Arab to Abadan, where I was anxious to discuss with him on the spot the question oi the proposed concession to Persia of an anchorage extending up to the thalweg of the Shatt, I wrote a long letter about this a few days later to Sir A, Clark Kerr, who sent a copy of it to the Foreign Office at the time, so that I need not discuss it further here, except to say that the visit was, I think, useful in enabling me to clear up with Colonel Ward certain obscurities in the situa tion. which had previously threatened to cause much misunderstanding. Colonel Ward was also able to explain to me personally his views and projects - which are interesting and important - on. the future conservancy of the Shatto 22o On. our way down the Shatt we passed three of the new Persian sloops, looking unexpectedly smart e We also passed a Persian naval tug bringing a dhow up to Mohammerah with a prizenv) - 12. crew on board. This was presuiiiably one of the Arab dhows whose arrests have formed the subject of recent correspon dence, although I heard nothing of the matter at Koweit or Bus hi re c 25 0 Returning to Basra, we called on His Majesty*s Consul, Mr« Brickell, a comparatively new arrival from New York: e We also met in the attractive garden of His Majesty's Consulate some of the officers of His Majesty 7 s sloops '.Deptford 5 ' and 'Bideford'p and various members of the British colony. A short talk I had vdth Judge Lloyd on the tedious and intricate question of the date gardens of the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Kpweit did not lead us any nearer a solution of the problem. ba!jra to kowmto 24. We left early next morning, February 21sb in a hired Ford car for Koweit. The smiling date gardens and green canals of Basra give way abruptly to salt mud flats and a stretch of desert which seems to form the natural boundary between Iraq and Arabia. The last Iraqi town, Zubair, is purely Arabian, and was our first sight of the local colour of the desert. It has something of the air of a desert fort, and the streets run between blind mud walls only broken by occasional heavy decorated doors. The population wore the universal kefiyeh, igal, and brown abba ? and were for the most part congregated in the market place, where a kind of fair was being held - complete with incongrous and rudimentary swingboats - to celebrate the Id at the close of the pilgrimage®ZII 13. 25. A slight difficulty in going to Koweit on the way to Persia is that a passport to be valid for Persia must not bear any indication of having been used for Koweit or Bahrain, or the Persian authorities will refuse to recognise it. Two separate passports are thus necessary, a duplication liable to caune much inconvenience and confusion. I note this trivial complication as it is one of the many minor drawbacks of the present undigni fied anomalous situation in which the Persians refuse to recognise the existence of the Gulf States or our own position in regard to them. 26. It is four hours by car from Basra to Koweit. Zubair is within an hour of Basra and it is about an hour and a half further to the Koweit boundary at Safwan, where we found a relief car sent by the Political Agent at Koweit, Captain de G-aury, to meet us, with an English speaking armed retainer of the Sheikh of Koweit as escort. Another hour across a desert singularly green after recent rain, and with occasional large patches of closely growing deep blue iris, brought us to the head of Koweit Bay, with Koweit standing apparently straight out of the sea at its south-eastern corner. Captain de G -aury met us outside the town and took us on to the Agency in his own car. KOIEIT. 27. Koweit is an interesting town and lives up to its reputation for striking local colour. Its complete circle of walls and series of well defended gates are comparatively new - the late Sheikh Mubarrak is alleged to have told the American Mission, settled on the outskirts of what was then an undefended town, that no wall was necessary as 'he would be their wall' - but they give it much of its character. The various harbours for the pearl....J ** i 14, pearl fishing fleet and sea-going dhows are curious and interesting. But it would be out of place in this report to embark on a purely picturesque description of scenes and customs which are already fully and better described in ordinary narratives of travel, I will orJLy mention in passing that, owing to the Id y we found Koweit 5 like Zubair, en_f|te, every dhow beflagged, the market place thronged, and the Sheikh himself watching a ceremonial sword dance by his bodyguard, which he invited us to witness in his company. Miy wife sat beside His Excellency, unveiled, on a high settee. Our presence, though conspicuous, apparently caused no adverse comment. 28. The Sheikh dined at the Agency the same evening, and invited us to dine with him, in company with Captain de Gaury, on the following day. Captain de Gaury, who seems to have established a remarkable position for himself, and whose local knowledge struck me as not only profuse but profound, proved a skilful interpreter, so that I was able to form some idea of the Sheikh T s attitude and character^ Captain de Gaury and I had several long conversations on outstanding questions - notably the difficult problem of smug gling, which is poisoning Koweiti relations both with Iraq and with Saudi Arabia, and I gave an account of some of these conversations to Sir A, Clark Kerr in a letter, copies of which I gave to Captain de Gaury and to Colonel Fowle at the time. Copies of this letter, and of a later letter which I wrote to Sir A. Clark Kerr on the subject from Bushire, have been entered separately. 29, I have long been uneasy about our policy in regard to Koweit and my visit did nothing to allay my uneasiness, I am submitting a separate note on this question, which seems to me important in view of the key position which Koweit holds in relatioiv; to the Eastern air route, to the Shatt-el-Arab, and to the Persian Gulf generally.15 o I think it is likely to grow more rather than less important and urgent in view of possible developments in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. But it is difficult to devise a solution. One of the main dif ficulties is the character of the Sheikh, whose good qualities un fortunately seem likely to prove hardly less embarrassing to us than his failings, 30, Sheikh Ahmed is a youngish man with a strong personality ? considerable charm y and a determination to have his own way; but he seems to me conspicuously to lack political foresight and what the Americans call 'vision'. Unlike Sheikh Hamad of Bahrain, who has retained all the panoply of state, but has accepted with a good grace our complete control of his political affairs, Sheikh Ahmed strikes me as having set out to run a rather dangerous policy of his own, in thinly concealed opposition to our wishes. He seems to me increasingly inclined to try to play His Majesty f s Government,the Iraqi Government and King Ibn Saud off against each other - at present with considerable success. Meanwhile our own position is, as elsewhere in the Gulf, anomalous and ill-defined, and our sug gestions to the Sheikh, which we are not as yet prepared to enforce, are often met with bland obstruction. The weakness of our position seems to me to be due in part at least to the mainly negative nature of our policy - a point I have tried to deal with in the separate note referred to above, 31 # Our personal relations with the Sheikh however are excellent. He speaks with particular enthusiasm and affection of the British navy ? has the walls of his drawing room covered with photographs of the British officers with whom he has made friends and of the sloops which he has visited, and shows warm and open admiration for British institutions and for the British character. This, however, as in only too many othet cases, does not mean any specialC X)^ 10 special readiness to accept British guidance in the conduct of a ^ : ^ a ^ rs -* or co-operate without important reservations in the policy of His Majesty's Government. Meanwhile the serious friction which is a constant feature of the relations of Koweit with its two neighbours is one of the most tiresome and potentially dangerou of the minor problems with which we are faced in the Middle East. 32. The Sheikh himself is quite happy about the situation - and, as far as one can see, so are his subjects under his paternal rule. I was much^struck by the general cheerfulness of the in habitants, Possibly this is due to the fact that most of them seem to do a thriving trade in smuggling, and I am told that smugglers are naturally happy people. The Sheikh's contentment seems to be due partly to robust health and an active mind, and partly to the fact that according to local gossip he is putting by some £20,000 a year. 33. February 22nd, our second day at Koweit, was wet - a dis appointment to us as we were to have attended an Arab feast in the desert and a dancing display in the afternoon. But the Sheikh was radiant at what he called our 'green coming'. I had crossed swords with him on the subject of smuggling at a conference at the India Office during his last visit to London, but he was good enough to assure me that, in view of the rain I had brought him, our differenc would be forgiven (which I was glad of), and forgotten (which was more than I desired). 34. Sheikh Ahmed prides himself on his modernity. Dress trousers and patent shoes boldly showed below his sober black 'thoub' (a kind of cassock or long skirted gown worn in Arabia under the abba or cloak), and he gave us a European meal, in cluding French coffee, in a very European (and indeed slightly surburban) drawing room, full of cuckoo clocks and other gewgaws. Otherwise Koweit is still essentially mediaeval; but the discovery.,..%]&lt; 17. discovery of oil (though still in doubtfully paying quantities) and the influx of American oil drillers will hardly allow it to preserve its simple outlook and local colour long, I am including a note ahout the new political agency huilding at Koweit in paragraph 67 below. 35o Before we left Koweit we also met Colonel and Mrs. Dickson (Captain de G-aury's predecessor and now local representative of the Koweit Oil Company - a strong out not a silent man) 3 various other local notabilities, and the officers of the French sloop d 1 Iberville 5 which was carrying out a cruise in the Gulf. The French officers were partic ularly cordial and insistent on the need for Franco-British co-operation in the Fasto we left Koweit o.a February ^oi d in the British India So So 'Bandra'S in which we were the only passengers; and we arrived at Bushire on the following morning. BUSKIi f j A ki J shiraz. 36. Bushire 5 which looks attractive from the sea, owing chiefly to the fine range of mountains on the mainland - thirty miles away from where the town lies at the extremity of its long flat peninsula - struck me as a difficult and inconvenient harbour. Even the inner anchorage, where we lay, is two miles from the snore and can ? i understand, become inaccessible in rough weathero Cui snip was immediately subject to a rigorous control by Persian ofiicials. As a result of telegraphic instructions from Tehran, my wife and I were treated with every courtesy ana our xuggage was allowed through the customs unopened and without delay, But I gathered that this was most unusual, and that arrival at Bushire is seldom so comparatively easy and agreeable. Indeed it seemed to me that the political Resident s Personal Assistant/18. Assistant 5 who came on 'board to meet us 5 was treated with scanty considerations and the Residency launch was so 'badly hustled ? under the impassive eyes of the Persian police ? 'by the Persian dhows crowding round our ship? that sue nearly had her ensign snapped off - not 5 I think*, wholly accidentally« Our landing was hardly more dignified 9 and we were obliged to scramble ashore from the launch over a maze of dhows, on to a quay so congested with heaps, of ill-stacked and damaged crates and packing c0-ses (mostly containing American cars ana lorriosj that progress was most difficult» 57, Bushire struck me- as sordid and depressed, and I was glad to pass out of it into the open country* The Resident s dwelling house and private office are some seven miles from the town 3 in an attractive countryside, with a pleasant garden and fine views* ;e were most kindly received by Colonel and Mrs, Fowle, who proved charming hostSo Indeed I feel that after all their friendly hospitality, and the close agreement which Colonel Fowle and I reached on tne great majority of questions which we discussed, it must seem ungracious oi me to strike a critical note even on an entirely impersonal point of policyo But there is one such point on which I feel that I should be failing in sincerity, and impairing any usefulness this report may possess as a frank statement of my experiences and impressions, if I did not put my views on recordc ihj.s is the old question of where the Resident s head-quarters should be, 58o Almost from the first moment of my arrival, I was impressed by the anomalousness, and indeeo. inu.igni ^y, of the Politic al ResidenV _s_p Qsition in Pers ian territory The Political Resident is of course the highest British author!oy in the Persian Gulf, and is virtually Governor of the Arab States/511 19, Staues under our protection on the Arab shore., But in Persia he is merely a Consul-General 3 with no official privilege of any kind*, ana legally at the mercy of the v /hole clumsy machine of ignorant and obstructive officialdom which is the mark of the modern ultra-nationalist oriental State.. No communication addressed to Colonel Powle as Political Resident is delivered, and his connexion with the Arabian coast is of course neither recognised nor even admitted.. But this camouflage of his status as Consul-G-eneral of Bushire is hardly t aken seriously - indeedj as far as I could see5 only a small proportion of the Residency work has an even remotely consular character.. The whole establishment is far more of the type associated with a Provincial Governorate than with anything in the consular service s and the complex organisation of the Residency with its various separate official houses and offices ? its engineer and treasurer ? its special quarters for ,J rocess ,f at Shiraz 9 suggests nothing so much as that of an administrative unit of the Government of India. It is hardly surprising that the Persians look on this institution with suspic i on and rl j r! i 39 0 It seems to me a great tribute to our prestige s and a striking instance of the Persian dislike of finality ? that the Persian Government have not yet launched a determined attack on this paradoxical state of affairs, Indeed 9 locally s the Resident himself is still greeted with some state» He receives military salutes 3 guards are turned out for him when he passes and his personal authority and prestige seemed to me comparatively well estahlishedo No doubt this is in 1 ^ge measure due to the personality and tact of Colonel Fowle himselfo But the whole situation., which is an unmistakeable relic and insistent reminder of the days when we virtuallv e,' administered Southern Persia and the Persian shore of the Gulf, can/can only act as a constant irritant at Tehran; and it seems to me at anj moment the Central Government may well decide to take up this anomaly and place us in the position of having to beat an ignominious retreat« The inconvenience of attempt ing to administer the Arab coast from a distant point on foreign territory s with imperfect and inconvenient communic ations^ is a matter which mainly affects the Government of India, so that I do not want to stress this aspect of it undulyo But it does, in fact, also affect Foreign Office interestsj by slowing down the conduct of our relations with the Arab rulers of the, Gulf and thereby further complicating their relations with their foreign neighbours, e.g. Saudi Arabia and Iraqo Moreoever, I am more than ever convinced, as a result of my visit, that, apart from all these objections to any continuance of the present system, there is little hope of placing Anglo-Persian relations on a really satisfactory basis so long as the British Official who is virtually the Governor of our client States on the Arabian coast of the Gulf, retains his official headquarters on Persian soil. 40. I had some talk with Colonel Fowle on this question, and ventured to urge once more that every effort should be made to speed up the transfer of the Residency to Bahrein ~ a move which has already been agreed to in principle by His Majesty 1 s Government in the United Kingdom and by the Govern ment of India, and which seems to/be held up entirely on com paratively secondary questions of finance, the importance of which is insignificant in comparison with the political issues involved. I understood Colonel Fowle to take the view that, now that agreement had been reached in principle as to the desirability of the transfer, and now that arrangements for it were in fact in train, there was no need to snow undue hasteo But I must confess that, although we agreed on almost every/■ 21, every other subject;, I was left with the impression that he 1 ._ | • Xfvm w^WSSSSSP^- was not inclined to attach the js a- iiie importance and urRencyJ ^o this question as we have been inclined to do in London . 41o February 24th and 26th were almost entirely taken up with conversations with Colonel Fowle on various outstanding questions 3 more particularly that of the south - east ern fron t- iers of Arabia 9 which I had been asked by the Middle : ast Official Sub-Coimnittee to discuss with him 9 and that of Koweit-Iraq smugglings about which Sir A. Clark Kerr had asked me to give Colonel Fowle certain further orpJ. explanations. I recorded the result of our discussion on the first point in a note to Colonel Fowle s (of which a copy has been entered separately) ? and on the second in a private letter to Sir Ao Clark Kerr (of which a copy has also been separately entered (see paragraph 11 above) 0 ¥e also discussed some other questions of lesser importance ? and I think the con versations were useful to both of uSo Indeed5 Colonel Fowle was good enough to say that my trip would have been fully justified if only for the new light which I had been able to throw on the question of the south-eastern Arabia frontiers.. 42 0 Colonel Fowle had been anxious that if I went to Bushire I should pay a flying visit to Shiraz in order to get a glimpse of modern conditions.in southern ?ersia 0 We accord ingly left Bushire at 6 aoiiio on February 26th 9 in a hired car, returning three days latere I need not attempt any detailed description of this journey ? which is of course well knowiio I would only say that the grandeur and variety of the scenery of the seven passes which the road has to scale - each higher than the last, until the final ascent to some 7 3 000 feet - came as a revelation to me 0 The journey to Shiraz although the distance is only about 180 miles 3 normally takes twelve hours ? but in bad weather is known to have taken as much as five/22. five days. Indeed, our own return nearly came to an abrupt end, as we ran into a rain-storm at Kazarun which had turned three formidable passes into mud-slides. obliged to take most of the hairpin bends on these by a series of skid-turns, and at one point of the descent span round till we faced uphill on the edge of a precipice. Fortunat ly, our driver had expected snow and carried chains, which we fitted, and which enabled us to negotiate the rest of the route with a certain measure of precarious safety. I note these incidents for the guidance of future travellers. 45. Work was actively proceeding on the road, in antic ipation of an impending visit of the Shah, who was expected to travel from Bushire to Shiraz about the middle of March. Feverish efforts were in particular being made to repair and complete the execrable thirty miles of road and so-called track between Bushire and the foot of the mountains at Burazjun. Triumphal arches were being laboriously erected not only at Bushire, Kazarun and Shiraz, but in every village on the route. When we were leaving Persia a few days later, however, we heard that the Shah had said that he wanted no decorations, and much uncertainty prevailed whether they would not all have to be taken down. In view of the Shah's coming visit, the road was also the scene of much military activity. The troops we passed were, generally speaking, comparatively smart, and the Ammieh guards we met struck me as efficient. Ihey certainly seemed to have established a remarkable degree of securityo 44. At Sjiiraz we were entertained to a luncheon for twelve by the Governor General, Abul Path Dowlet Shahi, and nis wife. M. Ali Askar Soheily, the brother of the new Persian Minister in London, was also present. This was the first occasion on which His Excellency had entertained His Majesty's/o J Jr 25 o Majesty's Consul (with whom we were staying and who was therefore also invited)» The Governor General impressed me favourably, He was exceedingly European in appearance 9 manner and outlook 9 and seemed cultivated ? intelligent and keen ? though possibly somewhat lacking in vigouro Most of the party were very presentable 9 and the ladies - only recent ly freed from the chuddar - were well dressed and as agreeable as an imperfect knowledge of any comiaon language permitted.. The atmosphere was most cordial s and Mr, Vatkinson agreed that the party had been useful in breaking some very thick ice 3 althoughs of course 9 few if any Persians are yet allowed to visit His Majesty's Gonsulateo Indeed the position of His Majesty's Consul must be lonely and difficult ? and ^ could not help doubting whether the retention of the post is altogether justif^iiU But I hesitate to say even this with out knowing more about the views on this point of His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. 45o ¥e visited the mosques and bazaars of Shiraz under the guidance of an active and efficient Persian police officer put at our disposal by the Governor Generalc Although the mosques are fine, with some very beautiful tile- work and some striking colonnades of unusual design, and the bazaars are architecturally interesting, the prevailing impression left on me here*, as indeed at Bushire and a„il along the route we followed, was one of almost indescribable sordidness and squalor, owing to the fact that every man, woman and child, without exception (except for oflicials, soldiers and police - who are comparatively well dressed), now wears what were once European clothes, Kashqai shepherds wear the aged relics of Homburg hats and the ragged remains of overcoats issued in the remote past to the employees/cs s**- ** 24o employees of the London (jeneral Omnibus Companyo Women wear tattered but gaudy European hats and odds and ends of coats and skirts, apparently salved from the rubbish heaps and bonfires which should have been their final home after their discharge from their last slop-shop» I am told that at Bushire all the women were ordered to the police station so that their transformation might be verified and blessed.. But at the last moment only a dozen hats were availableo So the women of Bushire formed up in groups of twelve and the hats were passed from head to head ? until the whole town was de-chuddaredo ' I found the bazaars of Shiraz ? like those I visited in Arabia ? stocked with the nastiest products of Czechoslovakia and Japan. I was told that local craft- manship is still carried on to a certain extent in Isfahan? but in Shiraz it seemed to be restricted to a few rather inferior metal workers. Altogether a depressing impression? only compensated by the interest of the remarkable new discoveries at Persepolis? and by the striking natural beauty of the surrounding countryo 46o It would be impertinent for me on so short an acquaintance to generalise about the Persian character. Bub I cannot refrain from recording the extent to which I was impressed by the contrast between the manner and appearance of the Persians and of the Arabs* The curious? slightly effete effeminacy of the Persian? and his lack of humour about himself? his queer gentleness and his all pervading vanity? are particularly noticeable when contrasted with the rugged virility? comparative simplicity and bluff sense of humour of the Arabs of Arabia. BAHREIN AND QATAR, 47. We left Bushire on H.M. sloop 'Deptford' (Captain Bowlby)/25 o Bowlby) on the evening of March 2ncU Colonel Fowle had originally intended to go to Koweit 'by the slow inail 9 prior to a visit to India-, 'but as a result of our discuss ions on the question of the south-eastern Arabian frontiers 3 he decided that it would bs preferable to tackle the frontier question at once,, He therefore decided to change his plans and to accompany me to Bahrainwhere he arranged for Captain de G-aury to meet him ? in order that we might discuss the frontier question further with Colonel Lock., and, if we thought it desirable ? fly over the disputed frontier together 3 in order to see the position for ourselves. 48= Nothing could have been kinder than the way in which we were received and looked after by Captain Bowlby and the other officers of H p M.S. tf Deptford H o We were a large party and must have imposed a considerable strain on the resources of so small a ship ? but the sixteen hours we spent on board her were among the pleasantest of our whole journeyp and I think we were all sorry to part when we reached Bahrein on the morning of March 5rdo HoM.S.

The ceremonial was similar to that followed in Hasa and presumably elsewhere in Eastern Arabia - /im 26. coffee with cardamon was served at intervals (any dregs being thrown on the carpet or drunk by the servant) 3 rose water sprinkled on us from a silver sprinkler, and incense in a small brazier was broughtround to each guest in turiio There is a special technique for dealing with the incense, but it can be mastered without difficultyn The conversation was purely general; but Sheikh Hamad showed3 as on the other occasions on which we saw him ? grace and skill in making a few appropriate remarks to each member of the company, and in keeping the ball of conversation gently.rolling at an even pace - an accomplishment many Arabs lack, 50o On March 4th Colonel Fowle, Colonel Loch and I, having previously discussed every aspect of the frontier ♦ questio n in the light of the latest maps I had broughtfrom Air Headquarters at Bagdad, were taken for a long flight round the disputed frontier and the Qatar peninsula in a Royal Air Force Singapore flying boat which the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, had kindly placed at our disposalc I am submitting a separate note giving a detailed record of our flight o For the purposes of the present report it will be sufficient to say that we flew for nearly six hours, crossing to Qatar by Hawar Island (attributed to Bahrein and disputed by the rival British and American oil companies); thence down the West coast of Qatar to the Jgbel Nakhsht which had been specially marked for us by a party sent out by the Sheikh of Qatar, and round which we circled several times, taking a number of air photographs;, thence to Qasr-es-Salwa, which appeared quite deserted, and eastwards past Sakak and Anbak (also deserted), along the proposed frontier line to the Khor-el-Odeid 0 We made a careful inspection of the Khor - regarding which important correspondence had recently come/ The Jebel Nakhsh and the Khor-el-Odeid are two of the dis puted points over which the frontier negotiations with King Ibn Saud have hitherto broken down. 027. come to light (see separate reports), - and then tried to locate the ridge and/or wells of oufuk in the area known as the Sahkhat Matti« The configuration of this area proved different from what we had previously been led to expect, and though we circled over it many times we were none ox us able to locate either of these features. We returned along the East Coast of Qatar via Ras Musheirib, Wakra, Doha and the north end of the peninsula, and just befoie landing at Bahrein obtained a very striking and curious panoramic view of all the islands, which I found particularly interesting. 51. ffe were able as a result of our flight, to establish beyond any doubt that the J ebel Na kh sh is merely the south end of the Jebel Dukhan ridge and geographically an integral part of the Qatar peninsula, and that the Khor-el-Odeid can be of no use as a harbour owing to the long winding channel of silting sand which separates it from the sea, here in any case a mass of reefs. But we were unable to solve the problem of Sufuk - hitherto described as a key point - and we had no alternative but to ask Colonel Loch to arrange with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to have the place marked, as m the case of the Jebel Nakhsh, when Colonel Loch would fly over it again*. I was placed in the second pilot's seat and got an excellent view throughout the flight. 52. The flight was invaluable, and greatly helped us to/ Colonel Loch has since done this, and has established that Sufuk lies twelve miles from the sea (See Bahrein telegram No. 65 of March 24 to Bushire, and Bushire telegram No. 332 of March 24 to India Office).(p 28. to clarify our ideas about tho frontier line in this area. T ' e COTere d a wide area of country, little known even to the local authorities. It was a remarkable experience which I snoula have 'been very sorry to miss; and I am most grateful to tne Air Ministry and to the Air Officer Commanding Iraq, ior naving made it possible. As a result of this personal inspection of the frontier I was able to speak with much more authority when later Sir R. Bullard and I discussed the matter first with the Saudi Government and afterwards witn Jang Ibn Saud himself at Jedda - see paragraphs 118 and 121 below^ 53o While we were at Bahrein we saw a good deal of Sheikh Hamad, on whom we all paid a further call on March 5th at nis country palace, where he greeted us with great cordiality. It was an interesting visit. Mrs. Loch and my wife accompanied us, and we all sat in a row on the floor in a large reception room, with the Sheikh's sons and retain ers lacing us. The Sheikh is a much older man than Sheikh Ahmed of Koweit, although his dyed beard gives him a misleading air of early middle age. He is said to suffer from diabetes. Sheikh Hamad, possibly because his territories are islands, has accepted our tutelage with a good grace. he seems to have given his admirable British adviser, Mr. Belgrave, a free hand to undertake a great deal of necessary administration reform. , Mr. Belgrave's smartlv uniformed police with their red turbans and Khaki shorts are much in evidence and seem efficient» It is a great pdty that there is no corresponding British administrative adviser of this type in Kov/eito 54o providence has been kind to Sheikh Harnado Just as the/the pearl trade fell on evil days., plentiful and excellent oil was discovered in Bahrein - though 3 owing mainly to lack of foresight on the part of British oil interests, who would take no interest in the concession when they could have had it, the exploitation of this oil has fallen into American hands« The establishment of the new British naval station and air port has 'brought much trade and prosperity to the islands. The oil royalties assure the Government a steady and growing income. It seems hard on Ton Saud, whose needs are so much greater, that his infinitely larger neighbouring territory should so far have produced no natural resources in paying qualitieso 56. We were taken over the oil field and the various install ations of the Bahrein Petroleum Company or 'Bapco'S (the local subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California), by Mr, Skinner, the local manager - a keen and capable American. I am no judge of the technical side of this kind of organisation and can only say that it seemed to me efficient and well run. What we were better able to appreciate was tne new town which trie Company are building for their employees, and the amenities provided for in it. The houses which tne Company are erecting seem eminently suitable to local conditions. They are all provided with deep fly and mosquito-proof verandahs, ^air..copling^ and conditioning plant, electric refrigerators, bath rooms, and . modern interior sa nitatio n. They are well built of heat resisting material with a good surface, and are easy to run with a small staff. Their appearance is in keeping with the/^ / o ® 30. the surroundings and neither pretentious nor unsightly. Note on Official Architecture in th e ^siai^GulXt 56. These new Amer ican huildings seemed to me to afford a striking contrast to most of t he Government of India buildings wnich I visited in the Gulf. i'be latter all impressed me as belonging to a past age, and as ill- adapted to modern requirements. The Agency at Bahrein is a somewhat decrepit and inconvenient building of undis tinguished appearance, approached by a steep and awkward staircase. Several of the main rooms in it are so dark as to necessitate the use of electric light even at midday. It struck me as inconveniently planned and awkwardly placed. Moreover although it is on the edge of the sea, so that sea water could easily be used both for baths and for flushing drains, it has no kind of interior sanitation. 57. The buildings at Bushire seemed to me almost equally unsuccessful and inconvenient. They struck me as badly built, rambling structures, with all the drawbacks indicated above, conceived entirely in the spirit of the India of the last century. It is true that the Residency bu ilding at hns an attractiveness of its own ? and is not so ugly as some. Indeed its large mosque-like open roof, with isolated bedrooms scattered among the wide white columns like tents in a viceregal camp, has a certain exotic charm. But the building is full of defects, and seemed to me, as in the case of Bahrein, quite unsuitable to the conditions of today. dven at Koweit, where a new ambitious Agency building has recently been erected, it seemed to me, speaking quite personally, that the result31. 58/ was far from successful. The new Koweit Agency is 'built of yellow brick - which I should have thought would have held the heat - and consists almost entirely of a more or less crescent shaped facade, conspicuously devoid - to my mind - of artistic merit. The architecture is institutional and military and seemed to me out of keeping with the surroundinga I still cannot understand why the appropriate and attractive features of the local architecture, sucn as the large central courtyards and graceful native plaster work of Bahrein, Hasa and Riyadh, can not be adopted and utilized in our own huild- iu^s. At Koweit again, although the new agency is within a few yards of the sea, and has only just been built, no attempt seems to have been made to instal internal sea water sanitation. I feel bound to mention these purely personal criticisms - though I do so with much diffidence and reluctance after all the friendly hospitality I received - since we are about - I trust - to erect a new Political Residency at Bahrein, where a site has been chosen, ana for which plans are Being drawn up. It would he deplorable if what will eventually he the British headquarters in the Gulf were to be no more worthy of our position and-prestige than the present Buildings. I can only express the earnest hope that the precedents of these Buildings will not Be followed, that the opportunity we now have will not 'be missed.9 anci that something different and Better than what we have Become used to will emerge.BAHREIN TO H A S ii 58, We left Bahrein early on March 6th ? in a converted dhow sent from Ujair 'by the Saudi Government to fetch us. It was a strange craft of XVIIth Century appearance, with a high 'balustraded poop covered with Persian carpets for our benefit. 69. The journey from Bahrein to Ujair normally takes some seven hours. In spite of a choppy sea we managed to consume without undue difficulty the series of meals&lt;, endless cups of coffee s and glasses of tea provided for us 'by our thoughtful crew. The Dohat es Salwa Gulf s which we had to cross diagonally from North-East to South-'A'est«, is practically unsurveyed, except cursorily from the air. Our course ran through numerous reefs and shoals 9 and the approach to hjair round Ras Sayia looks as though it might he difficult to negotiate for anyone not closely familiar with these waters. The distances were all much greater than i had expected, 60. Ujair is a tiny place consisting of one round towers a small fort&lt;, a fairly new Customs Luilding ? half a dozen mud huts and a diminutive quay. Beside the quay lay six dhows unloading smelly sacks of fish alleged to 'be used as camel food. 61. We were warmly welcomed by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Saudi Minister in London&lt;, ¥/ho was our host throughout the trip, and 'by a dozen or so local personalities. These included the Amir of Ujair s a refined and dignified old man with a melancholy smile, and the rather less attractive local Director of Customs, who knew a few words of English. While tea was 'being served a hale was 'brought in containing the Arah clothes which ,..&lt;\ *X, | 35. which Sheikh Hafiz had provided for us - a formidahly heavy 'but very fine 'black and gold abba for my wife5 and a headress and' brown abba for myself. My wife provided her own veil and eventually became skilled at shrouding herself more or less completely as circumstances required. I found my own trappings tolerable enough and a welcome means of avoiding remark in a crowd. Indeed? even my wife would sometimes take me in the distance for an Arab. But my kefiyeh was hot and tiresome in the smij and I never learnt to keep my abba in controls so that on windy days or nights it was fatally apt to catch in thorn trees 9 lighted lanterns and other obstructions. 62. We left Ujair at about 4,30 with an advance convoy of 3 Ford cars and a Ford brake. The rest of our caravan was ^ awaiting us at Hasa. 63. The route across Arabia is described by Captain de Gaury in the Air Ministry's 'Handbook of Field Notes on Saudi Arabia' (1936) 9 and has also been described elsewhere by Mr. Philby and others ? so that I need not describe it again here in any great detail. The following notes on our own journey and experiences may ? however5 be of some interest. 64. On leaving Ujair the route starts at once inland across a wide area of low dunes of wind-blown silvery sand. These grow higher and their colour grows finer as one leaves the coasto Their shapes 9 curves and ridges., extending to the horizon in all directionsj are reminiscent of a high alpine landscape in midwinter. Near the coast ? and also later towards the inland edge of the dunes 9 there are a few bushes and sparse tufts of grass ? but the centre of the area has little or no vegetation. I understand Jhat it is in fact a northern spur of the great south eastern desert. There is no track, but cars can cross the dunes by an apparently ...C) ' ' % ^2^ J- 54. apparently fairly well-known route without great difficulty ? particularly if there has previously 'been some rain to hind the sand 9 though the steeper edges of the dunes must he avoided. Speed is essential to reduce the risk of sinking in soft patches^ and the rapid motion over the sharp rises and falls of the dunes is exhilarating. Pressure in the tyres is reduced to give a better grip^ and cars stop every ten or fifteen miles to allow the engines to cool. 65. After 26 or 50 miles of sand dunes the route crosses a large sabkhat or salt plain ? impassable in wet weather s when cars must make a wide detour to the south on to higher stonier ground. Towards the inland limit of the sand 9 groups of palms began to appear5 and shortly afterwards we passed two large fortified villages on the edge of the Hasa oasis. The town of Hofuf s now generally called Hasa (a name formerly used only for the whole province) s is about fifty miles from Ujair5 and in normal conditions the run should not take more than two hours. Unless the sand is very soft it is not difficult or tiring. hasa 66. The Hasa oasis is large and fertile. It consists of groups of gardens separated by little lanes between mud walls and irrigated from the numerous large springs for which the oasis is famous. I was told that these gardens extend for some 20 miles from north to south and for some ten miles from east to west. The figures of the population are contradictory. Captain de Gaury puts the population of the v/hole oasis at about 50,000. On the other hand Abdurrahman Qusaibi s a prominent member of the well- known local family of that name ? with whom I had much talk 3 asserted that the total population of the oasis was in the neighbourhood ...r\ C\ K *) '(g) 35» neighbourhood of 200,0005 and that of the town of Hasa not less than 26 5 000. Certainly the town seems large and (for Arabia) prosperous, and I should have 'been inclined to accept this figure for it. QusaiM said that there were some 70 or 80 villages in the oasis. On our own short route I certainly saw 4- or 5. I am inclined to think, therefore, that Captain de Gaury's figure is an underestimate, 67* The springs and gardens are most attractive» The 6 or 7 springs we visited rose perpendicularly from large well-like holes 5 some six to ten feet in diameter and apparently of great depth, in the middle of pools of clear water of a beautiful peacock green colour flowing over silver sand. The water is led from these pools by fast-flowing streams, generally some 6 or 8 feet wide, and distributed among the gardens, which are exceptionally fertile. The gardens are full of well-tended palm trees which bear a valuable date crop. Below these, and shaded by them from the summer heat of the sun, are orchards of peach, pomegranate, a citrus tree bearing a fruit with a very rugged skin the size of a small melon, and an excellent dwarf lime. As in the volcanic parts of Italy, the same soil will bear in addition various crops of vegetables. Some of the gardens grew only wheat and barley below the palms, and there were a few cornfields v/ithout any palms at all. The richer inhabitants of Hasa have small summer pavilions in their gardens, attractively built with high arcaded diwans. Some have charming bathing pools. We visited several of these gardens and found each more delighful than the last. Some of the springs are warm and sulphurous. Two in particular have special bathing pools, much frequented for their health-giving properties. My wife caused a mild sensation by visiting the women's half of the largest pool. The women bathers were clothed from top to toe in long bathing gowns, but all hurried ...56, hurried out of the water at her approach and formed an in quisitive circle round her s from which she only extricated herself with difficulty. 68. The town of liasa has an outer wall hut also contains an inner walled city^ with separate fortified gates, known as the kut or citadel. We were housed in this in an attractive guesthouse attached to the Amir's Palacej and used 'by King Ihn Saud on his comparatively rare visits. The guest-house was architecturally interesting&lt;, and we found it comfortable and agreeable to stay in. Its furniture was limited, of course, to the inevitable carpets and cushions on the floor, hut we had the use of our camp beds and of the European chairs and tables which Sheikh Hafiz had brought for us on one of the lorries. 69» Shortly after our arrival, I was taken by Sheikh Hafiz to pay a formal call on Saud Ibn Jiluwi, the present Amir of Hasa. Our progress along the white roofs and ramparts of the citadel, preceded by an armed retainer of the Amir's with a lantern and a sword, had a fine dramatic atmosphere. But the Amir himself, who had created a bad impression on Sir Ao Ryan and Captain de Gaury in November, 1955, impressed me no more favourably^ His expression was shifty, though this may have been partly accounted for by an extreme inward squint. He made little or no effort at conversation, and was generally unresponsive to the polite remarks which I addressed to him. His retainers, who sat in two rows at the far end of the long saloon in which I was received, seemed a gloomy crowd, and from what I heard while I was in Hasa I got the impression that he was a colourless creature with little authority or energy and unlikely to prove much of a successor to his ruthless and successful father. We were ...We were shown his stables with a large number of Arab horses 5 including some fine greys s but I gathered that he had abandoned horse-racing and was not much interested in horsemanship? and that the stud was rather going down-hill. He seemed as careless of his gardens as of his stud. But I may be doing him an injustice ? for I only saw him. twice and got nothing out of him. Silence is not necessarily uncivil in Arabia, and I later found that he had sent us a car of his own as a relief on hearing that some of ours were in difficulties. 70. Our chief hosts in Hasa were the Qusaibi family, who were most assiduous in their attentions and took a great deal of trouble to show us round and make us comfortable. Abdurrahman Qusaibi acted as our.guide and I found him agreeable and intelligent. His brother Saad, who at first impressed me less favourably, thawed as our visit went on, and, although he seemed a little suspicious of the presence of my wife and appeared to be a stricter Moslem than his brother, he parted from us when we left on the most cordial terms. My wife had the opportunity of paying an interesting visit to the ladies and children of the joint Qusaibi household. 71. The Qusaibi family play an important commercial, and indeed political, role in this part of Arabia, and we have had reason in the past to suspect them of creating difficulties in regard to the reopening of trade between Saudi Arabia and Koweit, in view of their special interest in trade passing through Bahrein. i would not put it past them to grind their 0¥/n axes when it suits them, but on the whole I was pleasantly impressed by them on this occasion. H A S a TO RIYADH 72. We left Hasa with regret on March 8th. we now had our full train of four cars, four lorries and one Ford shooting brake. There were ...88. were some 25 men attached to the convoy including the guides and our own Berherine servants. Our route ran at first in a north westerly direction, through changing and broken country, passing several curious ranges of sandstone hills, many of which are eroded into fantastic shapes. At the time of our journey much of the country was green, heing covered by sparse grass or scrub and numerous small bushes. The colour of the hills was varied and striking. Some 50 miles from Hofuf we reached a wide area of soft sand in which our lorries stuck badly several times, causing some hours' delay. Hardly were the lorries out when our own car also stuck, and eventually had to be abandoned with a burnt-out clutch; but we continued in a relief car sent from Hasa. Eventually, after crossing a very large, flat, salt area (the Sabkhat et Uraira) we reached Uraira Wells, an interesting deserted settle ment of the Ajam tribe, with several well-built houses in good condition but completely deserted since the rising of 1929, There are some fine tamarisk trees at these v/ells, and the general appearance of the surrounding country at this time of the year was fairly fertile. A number of small caravans passed us, and several herds of camels were being pastured in the neighbourhood. 73. We camped for the night under the shelter of a ridge to the south of us, some 30 miles beyond Uraira. For some hours we feared we might have to sleep supperless in an open car, since several of the lorries had again stuck and others had taken a wrong track following on a difference of opinion with the guide. It was a disagreeable prospect, as a gale had got up, it had become bitterly cold, and our rugs and bedding were in the lorry. But the straying lorries were eventually almost miraculously retrieved the camp was set up at 11 p.m. and we ended by passing a comfortable night in a palatial tent, vaguely suggestive of the fisl'ci • • •39 e Field of the Cloth of Gold, which had 'been provided for us 'by the Saudi Government. 74. It should be explained that although maps of Arabia are often dotted with names, there are, in fact, hardly any places which in any other country would have names of their own. Frequently there is no sign of human habitation - beyond a few black camel-hair Bedouin tents - for tvvo or three hundred miles, and some of the most important wells marked on route charts and maps as conspicuous centres, consist of no more than an almost hidden hole in the ground, which can only be found by those familiar with the configuration of the hills and rocks in its vicinity. The majority of the places marked on Hunter's and other accepted maps, which we certainly ought to have passed, appeared to be unknown, and non-existent, while many wells or conspicuous features which we did in fact see are not shown on these maps at all. A new survey seems badly needed. 75. The best-known tracks are frequently completely un marked on the ground and cars select any route they like across the flat open country; but, in certain'areas where mountains or rocky outcrops close in on either side, deep wheel ruts will sometimes continue for miles. These, however, often offer worse going than the open plain, since they are apt to be worn so deep in the soft ground as to make it difficult for any car that has not got an exceptionally high clearance to run in them without striking its under-carriage. This is particularly the case in the sandy areas, where the wheel ruts rapidly become too deep to follow, while the sand itself is often deceptive, and what seems to be a hard patch will prove so soft that even the lightest car will stick in it. On the other hand, there are generally 20 or 30 men at'cached to each convoy, and they seem to take the extri cation „..%l ? (g) 40. extrication of cars from sand-drifts as a matter of course. I give full marks to the men of our own convoy for unfailing cheer fulness and perseverance in the laborious work of extricating cars from drifts and hogs. As against all this; there are many long stretches of gravel or hard earth where the going is almost as good as on Daytona Beach. 76. The country we traversed on March 9th was, for the most part, a kind of steppe which, at this time of the year, was well-covered with thin vegetation, including a great many small flowering plants and low hushes. Towards mid-day, we dropped from a high stony rather harren tableland on to the Dahana belt. Although this is marked as sandy on most maps and contains a few streaks and patches of sand, it is for the most part flat, open featureless but fairly green grazing country extending unbrokenly to the furthest horizon in all directions. There were a large number of camels, in this area, some of which were milked for us. We found the fresh milk excellent. 77. After some 120 miles we left the Dahana for slightly more broken country of a different type and stopped at about 4.30 at an important group of wells known as Ramah. Here a message reached us from the Amir Saud at Riyadh suggesting that we should halt at his hunting-camp of Rumheya, some 10 or 15 miles further on, although he would not be there himself. As we were already late it was eventually arranged that we should spend the night in the campj: where we were luxuriously housed in the Amir's own tent - a large double pavilion, as usual carpeted with fine Persian rugs but furnished only with cushions on the floor. 78. Our visit to this camp .was an interesting experience. After inspecting the camp, I joined the men at their evening meal, which ...41- B which was the usual Arab dinner of sheep roasted whole, eaten with the hand without knives or forks. I found the prooe.dings somewhat oo.plicated.

Before we left Rumheya camp early next morning (March 10th) three herds of camels, a large herd of hlack desert sheep and the Amir's hawks were marshalled group hy group for our inspection. They were a fine sight which I shall long remember. The hawks were particularly alluring birds. They each answered to their names, and seemed to be very tende'd by the respective keepers. 80. We left at about 8 a.m. in a large Buick car sent by the Amir Saud for us, and reached Riyadh at 11 after a 3 hours' run over increasingly stony desert country. The track crosses two ridges of hills by very steep gradients, and there are some fine view, of distant mountains of a curious purplish red colour- the general elevation of the plateau steadily increases as one goes westwards. I was unable-to take the total distance from Hasa to Riyadh on our own speedometers owing to our frequent changes of cars, but Captain de Gaury gives it as 520 kilometers, i.e. 326 miles. We were met a few miles from Riyadh by Mahomed Shaihoub, the aged but still vigorous director of finance of Nejd, whom the Amir saud had sent out to greet us. I understand that he is a sort of Grand Old man of local nolitirq c,., ^ pontics, we saw a good deal of him, and I rather liked him. RIYADH.ko 42. riyadh 81- The comparatively fertile oasis of Riyadh lies on a -tony table land bare of any other vegetation. The torn is surrounded by a wall from 16 to 20 feet high with the usual towers and gates, but is smaller and poorer than Hasa. It is - dominated by the Royal Palace, a high strongly fortified structure, and a network of palaces occupied by Ibn Baud's sons, which are to the main palace by passages and archways. in front of the main entrance of the palace there is a large open square where the bedum collect when they come to see Ibn Saud in the'summer. Along one side of this there is a guest house where the tribal Sheikhs are housed and where they and their tribesmen are fed for a period of three days,at the King's expense. The bazaars, which I visited next day under the escort of the Chief of Police, struck poor. jhey were as usual filled with inferior Japanese, Czechoslovak and German articles. Rice, spices and some other consumption goods come from India. Almost the only native produce appeared to be dates and seeds, and rather crudely painted doors. For British trade to attempt to compete would be as xiseless as for Harrods to attempt to compete with Woolwcrth's in a slunic 82. .iswere housed in the new Badia Palace miles north west of the torn on the edge of the comparatively lertile kadi Hanifa. This is one of two summer palaces built by the King and the Amir Saud, standing against a long line of gardens somewhat similar, but inferior, to the gardens of Hasa. Peaches are cultivated below the palm trees, which shelter them from .../ Li I ^ &gt;| f 0 43, irom the summer sun s but they are poorer in quality than those of Hasa ? and I saw no citrus. But there were a fair number of walled-in cornfields, particularly higher up the Wadi Hanifa s at Dereyah and Aweina* All these gardens, like those nearer the town, are irrigated from numerous deep wells, the water of which is pulled up in skins by teams of white donkeys - generally 6 or 4 to a well. The creaking of the pulleys of these wells - each on a slightly difierent note - is a curious and constant sound, known locally as the donkey's orchestra. 83, The new Badia Palace is a charming building looking over attractive gardens at the back and built round two colonnaded courts. The style of architecture and interior decoration is striking and original. Both this style and the somewhat different style of the buildings of Hasa might well form useful models for some of the new buildings which we shall certainly have to erect in the near future in the minor Arab states of the Persian Gulf.* I do not wish to overload this report with unnecessary descriptions - but I took a number of photographs of these buildings which are available if required, 84. The Amir Saud received us in his palace in Riyadh shortly after our arrival and was exceedingly cordial and friendly. He was full of reminiscences of his visit to London in the summer of 1935, and of pleasurable anticipation of his impending visit for the Coronation. It was arranged that he, should come back and lunch with us informally at the Badia Palace. We therefore returned thither with His Royal Highness in a very gorgeous royal car, with two of the royal .,. Gf. paragraph 57 above.■■■■■■■■ 0 2^ ■ 44, royal oodyguard in brilliant scarlet and gold uniforms, armed with rifles and sv;ords s standing on the steps, and a relief car imeaiately behind. All this escort proved fully necessary, as fiu^l approach to the Badia Palace is across the soft sand of tne /fedi Hanifa in which cars almost invariably stick and out of which they have to be ignominiously pushed. Ours was no exception, •8b. We had four or five meetings with the Amir, and dined Aj-th him Quietly m his palace on the evening of March 11th, On that occasion we brought, our own Berberimservants, so that my wife ■ could be unveiled. He proved a charming host. 8o There were only two occasions on which political subjects were discussed. The first was when the Amir received us on the morning of March Uth in a small room in the presence of j.iv^ or oix of his cousins and other members of the Saudi Royal family. Alter a little general conversation he explained that he wished to take the opportunity of their presence to say publicly and formally before them all, what might carry less weight if said privately, that the key-stone of Saudi policy was friendship with ^reat Britain. He hoped that this guiding principle would always be maintained. I replied that I knew that His Majesty's Government were actuated in their relations with Saudi Arabia by similar principles, but that the wisdom and sound judgment of King Ibn Saud .ad made the task of drawing our relations closer very much easier for use 87. The second occasion was at dinner the same evening, when the Amir said that, although he did not wish to discuss ..politics in general, he could not refrain from asking me for some explanation oi the situation, and of recent events, in Spain. J did my best to give His Royal Highness a clear and impartial acccunt oi the origin and development of the present trouble, quoting some Of 0 o «1 LL J,-if-^ 46o of my own experiences when I had been myself a Secretary at Madrid many years earlier 0 I laid particular stress on the efforts which His Majesty's Government had made to prevent the present wretched civil war from spreading and leading to wider hostilities in Europe. I emphasised the part which Mr. Eden and Lord Plymouth had played in this effort, and the measure of success which had been achieved by the Non-intervention Committee under Lord Plymouth's guidance. In the hope of avoiding too much tedious solemnity I told the Amir that since the Spanish war had become so largely a matter for foreign armies, it was now being currently rumoured in Europe that General Franco and Senor Largo Caballero were about to apply for membership of the Non intervention Committeec He seemed to appreciate the suggestion. 88, The atmosphere of the palace at Riyadh struck me as purely mediaeval. I received the impression of a civilisation and an outlook on life based on standards and a sense of values remote from those of the modern world, and in many ways more admirable - or at least more consistent and less materialistic. Incidentally I was much struck by the natural dignity and fine bearing of the Amir's retainers, of whom there were always some 20 or 30 at hand. They were for the most part good looking, virile men with clear cut intelligent faces. The scene was reminiscent of the best drawings of Eric Kenningtom Like most Arabs of Arabia they had a keen sense of humour, and seemed a cheerful company, although life in Riyadh can possess but few compensationso 89. On the other hand some of the notorious faults of the46e the /irab character were much in evidence» Improvidence and lack of practical efiiciency were conspicuous« Small instance were for example the condition of the road to the Badia Palace, to which I have already referredo Apart from the sand drift o:. the vfadi Hanifa 5 it was impeded by every sort of unnecessary obstruction. A few days labour would have sufficed to make the track reasonably practicable. But no effort was ever made to deal with it, although cars use it many times a day and must suffer constant needless depreci6.tion in consequence« Again, there is round Riyadh an abundance of excellent stone. But practically all buildings are built of mud, and are apt to fall at a touchc At the Badia Palace itself one of our cars struck ,a column supporting the roof of a garage shed. It proved to be of painted mud and loose stones., and immediately crumbled, letting down a large section of the roof* Larger buildings often melt awaydulng exceptionally heavy rain, and every ceiling showed traces of the last storm., No doubt,the methods administration in Riyadh itself would furnish many much more serious instancesof incapacity. There were of course no signs of any attempt at sanitation, and the spread of disease can only be checked by the excellency of the air and the power of the sun. In Riyadh itself, and more particularly in the Wadi Hanifa, there seems no lack of water, and the instalment of a few pumps might produce a much improved and far less wasteful supply. 90. Before we left Riyadh we paid a visit to the ruins of Dereyah, the ancient capital - still a remarkable monument of the ancient greatness of the Wahabis. The surrounding gardens seemed particularly rich and prosperous, and there were some signs of resettlement in progress» RIYADH ..,n 11 \ 47. RIYADH TO TAlff 91o We leit Riyadh - after much typically unnecessary delay - at 10cSO a^nu on March 12. The route we followed leaves Riyadh by a wide bend to the north, passing the striking ruins and long straggling modern village of Aweyna (given by Philby as Ayaina) lying among cornfields towards the head of the fertile Wadi Hanifa some seventeen miles from Riyadhu Thence the track climbs through a green valley to a low pass and crosses into a new type of rather barren country between the great red bluffs of the Tuwaiq Hills 0 After crossing some wide grass-covered plains ? it skirts the south edge of the curious brilliant coral coloured sands ot the Nefud Turaife There are three fortified villages on this sector of the route - Barra., Awainid, and - after a long stretch of plain - Marat» The latter, which 107 miles from Riyadh, is built of deep red mud reminiscent of parts of Devon, and stands among many fertile looking palm gardens 0 After this the scenery changes again to a plain of basalt outcrops, and then the route crosses the worst and longest area of sand we had yet encountered,ttt^^Hefud el Sirrc We found that the only comparatively safe track across this was along the deep and uneven wheel ruts of former travellers; and for about an hour v/e were buffetted along this track at high speed, for fear of sticking, with all the sensations of being in a small skiff on an exceedingly rough sea. Eventually we reached Duwadmi (about two hundred miles from Riyadh), anJ insignificant little village, with a few wells and a large fort and petrol storeo Except for the fort at Muweih two hundred and lifty miles further on, this is the only fixed human habitation between Marat and Taif, a distance of nearly five hundred miles. All the rest ol our convoy, including our tents, c amp o o e48 - fwt) camp beds and food, had stuck for the night in the sands of the Nefud el Sirr. So we vrere housed in the guest room of the icrt (clean, carpeted and becushioned but otherwise bare .t, where we slept supperless but in tolerable comfort on the floor. B'ortunately we had some biscuits and mineral water with us - ana a small surreptitious flask. 92. Our next day's run, on March 13, was just under two hundred miles. The route ran at first through granite country with high oddly shaped tors, and later across wide silvery green plains fringed with jagged rose coloured and purple nills. met, particularly at the well of Afif, a number of tightly packed lorry loads of pilgrims returning from Mecca to eastern Arabia - the camel caravan route runs further to the south, so that we only passed cars. We eventually found a good camping ground among large salam bushes, at Dafina wells. we had now recovered most of our convoy and slept very comfortably in our own tent. One of the food lorries was still lost, but the personael of the convoy made up for this by killing o.nd e^^^ng a. sheep which they hai purchased at Duwadmi, and whose melancholy face, looking over the side of the lorry, and xixlea witn presentiment of doom, had haunted us at intervals all day. 93. On March 14 we had a shorter and easier run than usual, from Dafina to Ashaira. After crossing a wide sabkhat or flat salt plain (the Sabkhat Dafina - described by Philby as the Khabra Khal), parts of which were so thickly covered with salt as to look like fields of freshly xallen snow, we reached IviiiwG in o o o95. Muweih tort and petrol store ? a gloomy structure built of black basalt 9 surrounded by heaps of refuse and empty petrol drums. According to Sheikh Hafiz this point marks the boundary between Nejd and the Hejaz 5 which begins immediately to the west above a long dark brown escarpment of igneous rock. The route vMch had been taking an increasingly southerly direction^ here turns due south. Aft ,p /r running down the sandy Wadi Huwwa for a few miles it leads on to a wide light gravel plain known as the Ruqba 5 fairly thickly covered with salam bushes ? some reaching to ten feet in height. Going is excellent and three cars abreast were able at times to get up to seventy miles an hours although we ¥/ere still steadily risingo After this we crossed a wet patch of sandy soil where a rain storm had burst the previous day ? and where one of our cars had to be laboriously extricated from a bog. Soon after this the track crossed a'corner of the great Harra belt of black volcanic boulders which lay to the west of us 9 and almost immediately after ? at about 5 poiiu we reached Ashaira wells. These wells are about 4,700 feet above the sea 5 150 miles from Dafina and some 660 miles from Riyadh. The place is one of Ibn Saud's favourite camping sites, in attractive park-like country, just under the south edge of the Harrao Almost at the same moment (by skilful synchronization) Sir Reader Bullard and Mr« Eyres arrived, having come up trie day's journey Irom Jedda to meet uSo 94. After a pleasant night in camp ?t Ashaira we left the next morning for Taif where we arrived at 10 C 50 a.nu on March 15. The total distance from Riyadh to Taif by this route was just under six hundred miles. We had come about 1126 miles from Ujair.TAIF AND SE a FA c 5 o o 95o Taif was a disappointment to me - at any rate at first sightc It lies badly, where the north-east foothills of the Shafa mountains meet the Central Arabian plateau, and has no view to speak of. Most of the town outside the old walls is still in ruins from the days of the Great War or of that against the Hashirnites, and most of what is not in ruins is unfinished. The pavilion and guest house where we were lodged were exceptions, were pretty and well built and had a pleasant garden with a foun tain, But most of the town - even within the old walls, where tall semi-Turkish houses still stand with some air of dignity and there are a couple of tolerable Mosques - bears a decaying and derelict look, 96. We were received with the usual quietly solicitous cordiality - the Arabs we met never fussed. Sentries and an armed guard of be-khakied Hejazi troops were posted at our gate and presented arms meticulously and smartly whenever we passed. The Amir of Taif and his Secretary and Aide-de-Camp came to greet uacncur arrival, and the accommodation put at our disposal was comfortable and clean. But on the first day we only stayed an hour or so, as a further expedition had been planned for us, which it may perhaps be worth briefly describing, 97, Sheikh Hafiz had insisted from the first that we must visit the mountains of Shafa, south of Taif, and scale a hilltop that would have shown us all the Tihama, The climb was to be three hours from the end of the last practicable car track and we were to begin cur ascent at 2 p,m. It was typical of Arabia that, when we were already late at the meeting point, our hosts must needs have61. a six course luncheon cookedy and a tent set up for us to eat it in 5 so that we started the climb well after four. 98„ We were a long caravan mounted on ponies and donkeys with two camels bringing up our bedding. The track climbed through fine valleys betv/een rising granite hills past apparently unnamed villages 9 or rather groups of huts 5 each with its fort and watch tower dating from precarious Turkish and Hashimite days. To each group there would be two or three wells, worked by donkeys or lightly built Indian humped cattle, and perhaps a dozen cornfields and orchards enclosed by mud or granite walls. Then a climb among granite boulders up a hillside rich with lavender in full flower, to what we thought our final ridge. 99o Here cur last hope of reaching our mountain top before nightfall vanished, and it was settled we should sleep in a 7,000 feet high village,- where some of us set up our beds in the fort and others in the open on the terrace outside it. A meal was produced, and we spent the rest of the evening watching the villagers and our own escort vying with each other round a camp fire in a competition of extempore verse, dance and song, which was one of the strangest spectacles we witnessed during our journey. 100o Next day we had no choice but to return to Taif, Sheikh liafiz bewailing the almost American haste which had placed his mountain top out of our reach. I shared his disappointment - but we had promised to lunch with the Amir of Taif, and it would have been fatal to fail him. Besides we had had a fair sight of the mountain country, which had exceeded -y expectations. 101. Our luncheon with the Amir was successful but unin spiring. He was almost as silent as the Amir of Hasa, though his manner 0 0 .*7 ^ (2J8) 52 o manner was charmingly courteous and his pleasant and rather melancholy smile disarming. Such conversation as there was was suitable and fireridly - 'but ininformativeo The Amir's house wfere we ate ? seated at a long table in the European manner ? showed- like most things in Taif - signs of ruin and decay 0 The windows were partly shuttered with packing case planks marked in English n This side up 3 with care s! 0 But Sheikh Kafiz spoke well of His Excellency 5 who made a good impression on Sir Ro Bullard^ and who certainly took a lot of trouble to give us a good reception 9 102, After the luncheon we visited the gardens of the Leiyah valley, some 16 miles east of Taif e The valley is rich in water at a depth of a few feet only 5 and the gardens irrigated f3?om these shallow wells extend for a length of some thirty inileSo There are few palms 3 but a great deal of corn and fruit orchards of various kinds, notably lemons, apricots and quince 0 We were given tea on the terrace of a large and well built house in one of the numerous villages scattered along the valley and were told that this was a favourite summer camping ground of the Amir Feisal, who, as Viceroy of Mecca and Minister for Foreign Affairs has to spend most of the year in the HejaZo TAIF.TO JEDDA, 103o We left Taif on March 17th for Jeddao Through Mecca the journey only takes five hours, but this route was closed to us as non-Moslems. The Wadi Fatima - a seven or eight hour alternative route known as the Christians' way - was reported impassable for cars owing to ,recent rain. So we were obliged to make a great detour to the north of Ashaira to strike the Arabian Mining „. &lt;.J- i \ i 53, Mining Syndicate's new road through the volcanic Harra, and thus spent some 12 hours on the journey. 104. I made detailed notes of the route, which is an un usual one, and which, though for the most part tedious, has the advantage of having a tolerable and well engineered road for a great part of its length. But I understand that the Mining Syndicate may be able to let us have their own maps and route notes, so my own rough notes can go into cold storage, and need only be very briefly summarized here. 105. Some ten miles after Ashaira i.e. some 60 miles north of Taif, the route strikes at right angles the Mining Syndicate's road from Jedda to their mine at Mahad, Gold has been found in the mine, but work is held up for lack of water. The route then fol lows the Syndicate's road westwards for endless miles across the Harra - a desperately dreary wilderness entirely covered with black lava boulders of varying size. Eventually it drops from the edge of tne plateau by well graded curves, falling from shelf to shelf of broken foothills until it reaches the semi-tropical coastal plain. Parts of the descent through the foothills are fine, and there is one cnarmmg palm grove oasis at Madhraqa where we lunched, and finally shed our Arab clothes. After another 70 miles or so the road leaves the mountains altogether and emerges on the Red Sea coast to the north of Jedda, where its construction seems to have been abandoned and cars have to plough through some miles of heavy sand. 106. We were met outside Jedda by the Kaimakam and an Under Secretary from the Saudi Foreign Offi a small escort of police. a puncture at this moment rather spoilt the effect of our entry .,.(S&gt; 54. entry, but we eventually reached His Majesty's Legation soon after 7..,50 p.m. The distance from Taif by this route was approximately 225 miles. Our total distance from Ujair had been 1350 miles. Ji fflOA AND KIFG I3H SAHD . 107. I had arranged to stay with Sir R. Bullard at Jedda, but on the eve of our arrival my plan was nearly wrecked on the rock of the Arab code of hospitality, which apparently demands that the stranger shall be your guest until he leaves your country. Arrangements were, it seemed, already in train to place a palace at our disposal, and it required much tactful diplomacy to con'/ince the Saudis without offence that the Legation was the right place for us to stay in. 10b. King Ibn Saud had been at Mecca all through February for the Pilgrimage and when we arrived was paying one of his rare visits to Jedda before his return to Riyadh. Sir R. Bullard had had one short meeting with him - his first since he had taken up his post - and was to have his second - for the purpose of present ing his new credentials - on the morning of March 18th. It was arranged that I should be presented to the King imediately after this ceremony, 109. The palace lies a mile or two south-east of Jedda, where, according to His Majesty, there are breaths of desert air and he can escape from the stuffiness of the town. It is an adequate though modest two-storied modern building approached by a reasonably good desert track. I was met at the entrance by Sheikh Hafiz and a secretary and escoxted up a stairway past rows of Nejdi retainers, all armed with rifles or swords, and suggesting Kennington's drawings no ,,.7^3 56 - 0 no less than did the Amir's retainers in Riyadh s to a wide sunbaked terrace with more retainers who stood to attention as I passed,, j-t the far side of the terrace was a large diwan or reception room with a square open bay at its furthest side where the King sat on a high seUee with open lightly barred windows round and behind him 0 uhen we later sat in this bay s the effect was as though we were in bhe open air ? ~ an appropriate atmosphere for our discussions,and incidentally a very refreshing way of holding a long meeting. The King watched me narrowly as I walked alone with such slow dignity as I could muster, first across the sunlit terrace and then through the dark diwan 0 But this was my only ordeal„ He received me with the utmost friendliness, which hadevery appearance of being genuineo 110o King Ibn Sand's photographs do him scanty justice, and quite fail to suggest the extraordinary charm of his personality. For one thing,they are nearly all full face, with the result that his features seem heavier, and his expression more rigid, than in iealiby c His face, though massive, and cast in the same generous mould as the rest of his person, is not ponderous or immobile, but finely proportioned and intensely full of vitality and mobility of expression. He has a well-shaped, aquiline nose, an immensely strong chin, and a curiously disarming smile. It is easy to understand bhe ruthlessness of which he has so often showed himself capable, and 1 do not want to exaggerate his charm; but the general impression he gives at first sight - or at least gave me, and not at first sight only ~ is one of kindliness and straightforwardness, and one fj. 3 oneself feeling an instinctive liking for the man from one's first meeting. The large scale of his mind and outlook is at once apparent, ,,,apparent. He obviously dislikes the irrelevant s the pernickety or the tedious - though he can sometimes lose himself a little in reminiscence5 particularly to a new listenero Like other rare large-minded men, he seems to 'bring fresh air into any discussion, to 'brush away trivialities, and to inspire in others a similar broad method of approach. It is perilous to attribute complete sincerity to anyone where international politics are concerned, and no doubt there are some matters - such as the frontiers and the Koweit blockade - where for his own reasons Ibn Saud is in no hurry to settle with us. But, subject to this caveat, I would say that I have seldom met anyone who gave me so strong an impression of sincerity and directness. 111. The King sat generally cross-leg ed and shoeless, on a high settee in the middle of the bay. Sir R, Builard and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin sat along one side of the bay on his right, and I and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba along the other on his left. uhen the Amir Peisal joined us, he sat below Sheikh Hafiz. All the talks we had w^re pleasantly informal, and at all our business meetings the translation was very skilfully performed by Sir R. Bullard and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the former translating into English and the latter into Arabic, oir R. Bullard's knowledge of Arabic ¥v T as, of course, invaluable, and has done much to smooth his path with The King. But the King generally spoke so clearly and slowly, and with so personal a note, that I found myself occasionally almost catching his meaning, even where I could not understand the words. 112. At this first preliminary interview Sheikh Hafiz was not present, and Ismail Efendi - the very capable Legation interpreter - took his place« The King enquired about our journey, and I thanked him ...67 „ him warmly for all he had dome for us 5 for the very complete and successful arrangements which had been made to meet or forestall our every want, and for the way in which the Amir Saud had re ceived and entertained us at Riyadho I also expressed special ^ appreciation of the untiring efforts which Sheikh Hafiz had made for us and for all that he had done for us on our journey, and I made one or two other suitable acknowledgments. I expressed my deep regret that I could not speak Arabic, saying that I was like a man who was deaf and dumb, but that I could still use my eyes. The King seemed to like this comparison, and repeated how useful it was to meet people face to face; no amount of correspondence could mean as much as personal discussion, even when it had to be carried on through an interpreter. After some further conversation on y l ' , '' ese lines, I said that I had been particularly impressed by the complete security I had found in the desert, which we had crossed practically unarmed, and where, although there had for centuries been insecurity, conditions now seemed more peaceful than in many European states. Ibn Saud replied that this was not his doing, but was due to the facts that the people of his kingdom were united by their religion, that they were true-to their principles and that they knew that he was devoted to the welfare of all of them, even the humblest, and that there was equal justice for all. I made an appropriate rejoinder, and, although at one moment the shadow of Palestine flitted across the conversation, the interview could hardly have oeen more cordial or encouraging, 113. Shortly after our interview with the King, Sir R. Bullard took me to call on the Amir Peisal, who is titular Minister for Foreign Affairs. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin were both ...0 2 Si, 58. both present. The conversation was general, and non-political, for the most part about the Amir's various visits to England, and the friends and acquaintances he had made there. At this inter- view I thought the Amir looked older, thinner, and more listless than when I had seen him last in the summer of 1932, hut he brightened up later, and my wife, who met him a few days' later in the Palace, when calling on some of the oueens, thought that he seemed brighter and happer than when she had last seen him in England. 1 find it hard to believe however, that he will .ever prove a ruler„ 11'*o ine same night the King gave a dinner party for some oO guests. Practically all the Legation staff invited, but no other foreigners (except ir. Philby, who is virtually a member of the court), the remaining guests heing Arabs. The dinner was in a long narrow room in the Palace, and was served in European fashion, oar own Berberine servcints being called in to help. It was well managed and well cooked. Sir R. Bullard sat on the King's rxght ana I on his left with Sheikh Hafiz beside re to interpret. 115. The King was in excellent form, and, even through an 'nterpiecer, a stimulating conversational companion. He talked well about a number of subjects. Someone having mentioned national characteristics, I told him the old series of definitions and distinctions between one, two and three Englishmen, Germans, Frenchmen, etc, - a chestnut which was fortunately new to him, ard which he apparently appreciated, Ke spoke with heat and feeling about the evils of European dictatorships, of which he is clearlv nervous, (He would, I think, hardly class himself as a dictator, as he would say he was only the interpreter and trustee of accepted principles o 6059. principles, acting with the support and approval of his people). I gathered that he distrusted Soviet Russia and Turkey no less than Italy and Germany, regarding them as equally totalitarian and both dangerously anti-religious. 116, He has a pleasant sense of humour and an appropriate jest delights him. He had a great joke with Sir R, Bullard about a Saudi shell which fell near the British Agency in 1926 when Ibn Saud was besieging Jedda, and Sir R. Bullard was British Agent there. The King clearly felt this had placed him under a special obligation to Sir Reader, whose providential escape was prophetic of their present friendship. On another occasion I told His Majesty how, when the Amir Saud had visited Ascot in 1955, his retainers had proved such good judges of horse-flesh that some of my colleagues had so far forgotten themselves as to contemplate forming a syndicate to exploit their talents. Unfortunately, at this point their good advice had broken down, and the project had had to be ignominously abandoned. The King followed up this _ u orj, witn a view, he told me, with a twinkle.in his one good eye, to reprimanding severely those who had'dared to give 'his friends' such bad advice; but he then found that the delinquents were not Arabs from Nejd at all, but two oyrians attached to the Amir's suite. This pleased him greatly, and the next day he told me that he had discovered the source of the trouble. 'If you will take the advice of Syrians about horses'. His Majesty said, 'what else can .you expects 117. Though simple in his personal tastes - he is plainly aressed, likes fresh air and early hours, and always seems eager to get back to the desert - he keeps up considerable state, has three huge special negro slaves in scarlet robes to wait on him and a aost o„-2 ^ ? A*' w 60. host of retainers within call, and when he goes to the Jedda mosques ior Friday prayer, has a Pord lorry in the procession with a rather sinister machine.gun ready mounted to deal drastically with any disturbance. The Hejaz has of course never whole heartedly accepted Nejdi domination. Ho. The next day, March 19th, it was arranged that Sir R. Bullard and I should have a series of conversations with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba on outstanding Anglo- Saudi questions. As Sir R. Bullard has explained in his despatches Nos. 40 and 54 of March 25rd and April 1st, Fuad Bey Ham 2 a had unexpectedly left Jedda, for reasons at which we could only guess. We had several long conversations of some importance. We spent the whole morning discussing the question of the South- Eastern Arabian frontiers. A full record of this conversation and of subsequent developments regarding the frontier question is contained in Sir R. Bullard's despatch No. 47 of March 27. As recorded by Sir R. Bullard, I subsequently found an opportunity to raise this particular question with King Ibn Saud himself, (see paragraph 125 below) but His Majesty's attitude suggested that it may be difficult to reach an early settlement of it. In the afternoon, we had another long meeting at which we discussed the questions of Koweit smuggling and of the Transjordan frontier. Sir 0 0 061c Sir R. Bullard has reported separately on these two discussions in his despatches No. 52 of April 1, and No, 42 of March 23, respectively 0 I think these talks did a good deal to clear the air and to dissipate unnecessary mi sunderstanding. Sir R 0 Bullard has also reported separately (see his despatch Ko, 54- of April 1st) on an interesting confidential conversation which m had with Sheikh Hafiz wahba after a small luncheon party which Sir R„ Bullard gave that day to some of our Arab friends. 119. Sheikh Yusuf made a not unfavourable impression on me. He struck me as less intelligent than Fuad Bey, nervous lest his master should think he had given something away, and deeply suspicious oi possible snags, particularly in any proposals we put forward. But he became more and more friendly as our dis cussions proceeded, and I think we succeeded in disarming some of his worst initial suspicions. On the whole I think he may be easier to deal with than Fuad, and I should be inclined to rate his sincerity and honesty reasonably high. 120. On the evening of the 19th the Amir Faisal g .L.ve a dinner at the j dda house of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, which followed the general lines of the King's dinner on a smaller scale. The combination of many hours of argument with Sheikh Yusuf5 and of the sudden plunge into the hot and relaxing air of Jedda after the invigorating air of the central deserts, must have begun to tell on me ? for I found it rather unnecessarily heavy going. Nothing passed of any interest. 121A 0 e62, 1'1. On Saturday the 20th we embarked on the series of conversations with King Ion Baud which bir R. Bullard has so fully and accurately reported in his despatch No, 41 of March 25rd and to which he has referred in other despatches and telegrams, notahly his telegrams Nos. 20 of March 24, and 26 of March 28, I need therefore do no more here than briefly mention a few of the more important points which arose in the course of our talks. 122, The King was clearly anxious about the situation in the Yemen, which he regarded as full of danger. He was disturbed also about any possible threat to his own security which might follow on a collapse of authority in the Yemen and possible foreign intervention in that country. He clearly would have welcomed some sort of British guarantee against such an emergency. Sir R. Bullard and I explained to him wny any such guarantee was impossible, 'but we drew His Majesty s attention to the declaration contained in the Rome Understanding of 1927 (the text of which had already 'been coimnunicated to him and of which 3ir R, Bullard gave him a further copy) to the effect that Eis Majesty's Gfovermient regarded it as a vital British imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. I suggested that it could reasonably be assumed from this that any threat by a European Power to the independence and integrity of baudi Arabia would involve a threat to our own imperial interests. If therefore a conflict developed it would almost certainly be a general one, in which we should also be involved, and in that event it was difficult to see any circumstances in which we should not find ourselves aligned side by side. I could not of course speak officially, and I was only giving my own impressions, for what they were&gt; 63, worth, but this was how I read the situatioru Sir.R. Billiard endorsed my views and emphasized that cominunity of interests was often a stronger bond than many alliances. I afterwards heard from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba that this conversation had given King Ibn baud great satisfaction, and had served to allay some of His Majesty's anxieties. bheikh Yusuf Yasin later spoke in a similar sense to Sir R. Bullard (see Sir R. Bullard f s 'T — telegram No, 25 of March 25), 123. On another occasion, King Ibn baud having asked why we had not wished the Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf under our protection to accede to the baudi-lraqi treaty, I took the ■opportunity to emphasize that, while His Majesty 1 s G -overnment desired, and would always respect, the independence and integrity of Saudi Arabia and of the independent Arab States, the Arab States under our protection were in a different category. From the international point of view, these States were under our suzerainty. Our relations with them were of very long standing (I took the opportunity to explain their origin) and not only gave us certain rights, but also involved us in certain obligations. It was for this reason that His Majesty 1 s Government were so anxious to clear up the question of the south eastern Arabian frontiers. It was clear, however, that the King was extremely reluctant to commit himself to any final settlement of this question. 124. Another point of special importance which was raised by King Ibn Saud was the question of Palestine. I have recorded my impressions of the King l s attitude on this question in a separate memorandum which I submitted on April 1 -3, and Sir R. Bullard has also referred to the matter in his telegram No. 20 of March 24 and in subsequent communications. I will not therefore develop this point further here* but it was clear that it was one on which the King felt very strongly, 125,64, 125 0 Lastly, it is perhaps worth drawing attention to the declaration, which King Ihn baud made more than once, that, rather than 'be untrue to his religion or his principles, he would gladly give up his throne. My impression was that his religious principles are strong and genuine, and that in making this declaration he meant what he said. 126. On the afternoon of March 20 we attended a tea-party given by Sheikh AMulla Suleiman, the Minister of Finance, mainly with the object of enabling King Ibn Saud to meet my wife. The marked cordiality with which he received her, and the departure which this entailedfraiihis usual practice in regard to European ladies, have been sufficiently reported in Sir R, Builard's despatch No. 40 of March 25. 127* On the evening of March 20th we all dined with Mr. Philby at his house outside the town. Mr. Philby is an old acquaintance of mine, and, though I am under no illusions about his failings, I have always appreciated his good qualities* He was friendly and interesting, but I was by that time too tired to make as much of the evening as I should have liked. My wife, however, had a good deal of interesting and useful conversation with hinu 128, In the intervals of meetings with the King and of official entertainment, I managed to see practically the whole of the British and American colony at Jedda and one or two of the foreign representatives - mostly at tea or sherry parties given by Sir R. Bullard, who is a very popular host. The British colony consists of the staff of His Majesty's Legation ? the engineers attached to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, and the staff of the various other British enterprises and institutions which carry on a more or less precarious existence in Saudi Arabia. The American colony consists mainly of the headquarters65. headquarters staff of the American Oil Company, which is endeavouring to find oil in Hasa. This is a branch, known as the California-Arabian Oil Company, of the Standard Oil Company of California, and works in close association with the Bahrein Oil Company (see paragraph 56 above). Mr 0 Thornburg and Mr. Davies, two directors of the American parent Company, and Mr 0 Hamilton, their London representative, were also in Jedda, We had already met them in Bahrein and they had followed us across Arabia in rapid stages in two light Ford cars e They were extremely friendly and when we left gave us a great send off on board our ship. It is doubtful, however, whether oil will be found in Hasa in commercial quantities, and the future of the Company is there fore still uncertain. If the enterprise fails it will be a great blow for Ibn baud, who desperately needs some reliable source of revenue. The only other foreigners I met were the new Italian Minister - who did not impress me very favourably, although he did not appear to be ill-intentioned and took some trouble to be civil, and his Vice-Consul, a Levantine Italian, whose looks I did not fancy, M. Maigret, the French Minister., who has recently returned from the Yemen and is a somewhat notorious figure in Jedda, was ill, but sent me a very civil card of apology and regret for not having been able to call on me, 129. Apart from this, my time was too limited and too full of official engagements to enable me even to see the town and bazaars. My wife, however, was able to see a little, and notably to pay a most interesting visit to King Ibn Baud's favourite wife Umm Mansur (1,0, 'the mothe-r of [the Amir] Mansur u - since a woman is nearly always known in Arabia as the mother of such and such a son, if she has one). It wouldwould be beyond the scope of this report to reproduce my wife's description of this visit 5 but it is perhaps worth noting that, according to confidential information we had received, Umrn Mansur was originally a Christian girl from the Lebanon, sent by the Turks to Ibn baud as a gift in the early days of the waro I gather she now seemed happy enough, and she impressed my wife as a woman of personality and character. ISO, Jedda is so well known that it is unnecessary for me to say much about it in this report, which is already too long 0 But there are two points on which a word or-two may perhaps not be out of place. The first is the great contrast I found between the climate of Jedda and that of all the other parts of Arabia I visited 0 Up to the western edge of the Hejaz hills, where we began dropping down to the coastal plain, the climate had been dry and invigorating, and we had hardly felt a moment of fatigue 0 In Jedda everything became rather an effort - even in mid-March, which was still the cool season - and tropical clothes were almost essential. We arrived with a south wind, and found it difficult to sleep without electric fans c The wind changed on the following day, which was pleasant enough, though still very hot; but the south wind returned a few days later. The mosquitos were a particular affliction and showed great skill in finding chinks in the wire gauze of the windows or in our mosquito curtains. I feel more than ever that the climate of this post imposes a very exceptional strain on the men who work in it, and that every possible facility should be extended to them for local leave, Ocg* to Egypt or Palestine, and, I hope, eventually, when political conditions permit, for visit to Taif, the Hejaz Hills, and the central plateauo In spite of all this I was much impressed by the unfailing cheerfulness of everyone67. I met on the btaff of His Majesty's Legation. 131. The other point that impressed me was the comparative inadequacy of the Legation house. I feel bound to say that the present Legation - and particularly its situation - struck me personally as hardly worthy of our position and prestige. I am not sure how far bir R. Bullard would support this view., as, when I mentioned the subject to him, he said he thought that the house was one of the best in Jedda. I therefore only express it with diffidence. But I cannot help feeling that any house rising directly from the street, with no outer wall or enclosure, exposed to all the dust of passing traffic and with most of its rooms overlooked from neighbouring buildings, is far from ideal as the official residence of His Majesty's Diplomatic Representative in Arabia. The house is very near the sea and has a good terrace which might have a pleasant view. But it is cut off from the shore by the condenser plant, a hideous erection resembling a gas works. It is also almost immediately next to a prison. The Legation house is of great height with stairs of extraordinary steepness. It contains much ancient woodwork, which seemed to me to have suffered from the climate of Jedda and to give the house a rather decayed appearance. It is, however, well furnished with good English furniture, and both Sir R. Bullard and his predecessors have clearly done what good taste can do to make it tolerable. Nevertheless it looked to me as though it might at any time need extensive repairs. I realise of course that in present financial conditions any attempt to build or acquire a really suitable building for His Majesty s Legation would be out of the question. But I feel bound to record my personal impression that the present residence of His Majesty's Minister could be greatly improved upon.. Mr. Philby^ 68, r* lor example has a fine (though badly built) low house with wide court-yards, standing well outside the town. ihere seems to be plenty of space available, and if a good and well-designed nodern building suited to the clinatic conditions could be erected under European supervision outside, or at least nearer to, the town walls, it might not only make conaitions more tolerable for His Majesty 1 s Minister and the Legation btaff in a climate which is peculiarly disagreeable ana unhealthy, but might also have a useful propaganda effect. I should add, however, that I never heard a word of complaint on this subject while I was in Jedda, The opinions expressed in this paragraph are entirely my own. HO WARD JQURKHIY . 132. ,/e left Jedda on March 22nd after what turned out in the end to be far too short a stay. We were again obliged to travel in an Italian ship, this time owing to difficulties arising from the fact that the only British ships either carried returning pilgrims and were thus liable to long quarantine delays, or stopped only at Port Sudan and had long been fully booked up. No sloop could be made available at the requisite date. The local Italian Red bea service we travelled by has a poor reputation, but proved comfortable enough. The officers of the ship were most friendly, but - like those of the other Italian ships we travelled on - nervous and unhappy about the international situation, and apparently anxious to see Anglo-Italian relations re-established on a better basis, I suggested to them they they should begin by dealing with Dr. Gayda. 153. y/e reached Suez on March 25th, and I was able on the road between Suez and Cairo to meet Sir M. Lajnpson, who was on his way to Sinai, and to have half an hour's conversation v/ith® %7 69. with him in the desert. I gave him a short account of my conversations with King Ibn baud 3 and we briefly discussed the question of the probable reaction of the Arab countries to the eventual report of the Royal Commission on Palestine and the ultimate decision of His Majesty's Government thereon. He agreed that the prospects were extremely disquieting* I have quoted his views on this point in my note of April 12th referred to in paragraph 124 above 0 We also had a useful talk about Italian activities in the Middle East. we spent two nights in Cairo as the guests of Mr. and Mrs, Sterndale Bennettof His Majesty's Embassy, and left Egypt by the Italian S.S. n Esperia ,, on March 27th 9 arriving in London on the evening of April Isto I resumed my duties at the Foreign Office on April 2nd. CONCLUSION . 134. Before ending this report 9 I feel I should place on record in the first place my appreciation of all that the Saudi authorities did to make our visit a success. The hospitality extended to us by King Ibn baud was indeed almost overwhelming, and must, I fear, have involved the Saudi Govern ment in very considerable expense. The Amir Saud, in particular, took an infinity of trouble to show us every possible courtesy during our visit to Riyadh; and the Governor of Taif, no doubt under the King ! s instructions, also made the most elaborate arrangements for our comfort and convenience m Taif and in the Shafa hills. But my greatest debt is probably due to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba himself, who was our constant companion and personally supervised all the arrangements for our visit. We found him unfailingly friendly and helpiul; and, although I knew him well before I went to Arabia, I can sincerely say that in the course of our journey I grew to like70. like him steadily better - a somewhat unusual experience with travelling companions, 135 6 beeing that our journey was entirely private and unofficial, I was at first somewhat at a loss to account for the amount of trouble which the baudi authorities took ov;.;:' ic 0 I have now come to the conclusion that they must have regarded it as an opportunity of making some return to Kis Majesty's Government ? through the official mainly concerned with Arabian affairs, for the hospitality extended by His Majesty's Govern ment to the Amir Baud and to the Amir Feisal during their various visits to England in recent years. If I am right in thinking this, it may be that a v/ord of appreciation conveyed to King Ibn Baud through His Majesty's Minister at Jedda might not be inappropriate. 136, Finally, I wish to record my gratitude to all the British officials with whom we stayed or who helped to facilitate our journey. I am particularly grateful to Sir Reader Bullard, who was our principal-host, for his generous hospitality, unfailing kindness and friendly cooperation, and to Sir Archibald and Lady Clark Kerr at Bagdad, to Colonel and Mrs. Fowle at Bushire, to Colonel and Mrs, Loch at Bahrein, and to Captain de Gaury at Ko¥/eit, for the endless trouble they took to make our visits to these places a success. I am also very grateful to Colonel Ward at Basra, to Sir Richmond Palmer and Mr, Stanley at Larnaca, to Mr. Keith Roach at Haifa, to Colonel and Mrs, MacKereth at Damascus, to Mr, and Mrs, Bterndale Bennett in Cairoj and to Mr, Watkinson at Shiraz for all their help and hospitality, I must also again record my gratitude to the Admiralty and to Captain Bowlby of H,M.S. Deptford for the passage they provided for us from Bushire to Bahrein, and to the Air Ministry, to the Air Officer Commanding Iraq, and to the Commanding Officer of the Singapore flying boat, for7(cQ for the flight they were good enough to arrange for me over the Qatar peninsula on March 4tho There was nowhere on our route where we were not received with the utmost kindness and courtesy and made to feel that we were among friends&lt;, I have the honour to be 5 Sir ? Your most obedient, humble Servant s ,P.Z. 3339/1937. Extract from letter from Mr• 0.1. Rendel, Foreign Office, to Mr. J.C. Walton, India Office, dated 21.5.1937. Your more important suggestion is in regard to the paragraphs dealing with the Koweit. But here my difficulty is rather the same. I could, of course, put in a couple of paragraphs in defence of the Sheikh of Koweit, but the difficulty is that a good many copies of the report have already gone out, and I am not sure whether bo important an alteration is practicable without a good deal more labour than would be justified. Moreover, we have now discussed the whole question of Koweit at the interdepartmental meeting which took place here on May 18th when the various points you make in your letter were very fully gone into. In the circumstances might it not be enough to insert a passage in any covering letter you send to the recipients of the report, explaining that you have drawn my attention to the possible unfairness to the Sheikh in the passages in question and that the whole matter has now formed the subject of further discussion in the course of which a somewhat new light was thrown on the problem/ll / f problem, so 'tha't 'tins particular part of the report should be reaxi in conjunction with the record of that discussion and not independently?Extract from letter from Mr. J.C. Walton, India Office, to Mr. G.W. Rendel, Foreign Office, dated 11th May 1937. I have no very grave criticism as to what yoa have indicated of the India Office and Government of India point of view. In what is said about policy in Koweit, however, I do not think that it is quite correctly described, as at the end of paragraph 30, as 'mainly negative'. As regards the attitude of the Sheikh also there is, I think, one factor of importance which is not mentioned, i.e., the fact that the Sheikh has for long years had two legitimate grievances against His Majesty 1 s Government - namely the non-fulfilment or delayed fulfTlment of our promises about the date gardens and helping to secure the removal of Ibn Saud ! s blockade. We have, of course, done our best, and are continuing to do so, but it would not be surprising if the long wait had made the Sheikh somewhat bitter, as he struck me when he was here (rather than quite happy about the situation, as you describe him in paragraph 32); and it seems a probable partial explanation of his somewhat unamenable/_ o _ •w) unamenable attitude. The Sheikh of Bahrein, with whortf you contrast him, has nothing to complain of, and has flourished like the green bay tree under our protection. The fact that Koweit, unlike Bahrein, is on the mainland wedged between two larger States is also another factor which makes things much more difficult for the Sheikh of Koweit, as well as for us. I do not know whether you would care to add something on these points, in order to avoid any risk of doing an injustice to the Sheikh of Koweit through the omission of factors which are very likely relevant to his attitude. Only one other point. Does it give quite the right impression to say (paragraph 32) that most of the Sheikh 1 s subjects seem to do a thrivir^ trade in smuggling? *o doabt they import the goods into ivoweit, but we have always been told that the smuggling across the frontier into Iraq is done by Iraqis (Ue Gaury confirmed this to me orally the other day), and I think a large 'part of that into i^ejd is done (is it not?) by Ibn Saud ? s tribesmen.v&gt;|n fm^j Secret. \ 1 Office of the Political Resident in the Pars ian Gulf, Camp, Bafcre in. b.o.irq.a/iaa .

The question of these facilities was discussed at an informal Interdepartmental Meeting at the foreign Office on the I* 18th lay. Since the Meeting was Informal I am addressing you in demi-official form, but isy views can be regarded as entirely official if necessary. 5. At the Meeting referred to above Rend el, of the Foreign Office, advanced the argument that from the pol it ical point of view It would be of advantage for a small feval Stat ion with recreation ground to be established at Kuwait. I am afraid that I disagree entirely with this view, and am of opinion that no material political benefit would result from the establishment of such a Station. from this it follows that according to ray View the establishment of such a Station should be decided solely on its own Naval merits, and tnat polit ical considerations do not enter into it. I am giving my reasons for this opinion at length to the India Office and to the Government of India, 1 do not propose Inflicting this / Captain A.Poland, BSC. # Senior Haval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, H .M. 3.

With regard to tne suggestion iaade at the Meeting that more frequent naval risits might be made to Kuwait. Visits of Sloops are always popular at Kuwait as elsewhere on the Arab Coast, and I am gure tnat if these rieits can - witnout undue inoonrenienoe ~ be made more frequent the effect will be beneficial. 5. But If Tlslts of Sloops are to be more frequent then presumably recreational facilities on shore will be required rf for ratings as suggested in Admiralty message Mo.394 of the 26th June. Should it be decided by the Haval Authorities to establish these facilities 1 do not antiaipate that the Shaikhi from his point of view, will raise any difr icult ies, and when it is decided what facilities are required the Shaikh will be approached on the subject by de Gaury. 1 am sending copies of this letter to Parsons, (Govern ment of India), wit on (at the India Office) and de Gaury. * sent under Printed letter No.C/169 of the 15th August 1937.jt' —: 2^76 SBOHHP* Offioe of the Political Hesiderit ia tne Pers ian 0ulf f gampt w* Bated the 16th August 1937 li 0 # Ho d rt 'i 7^ Could you please refer to India Office telegram Mo« 17bl of the 26th June 1937, and a memorandum prepared by ^i'\ c \ Hendel^ received lay me under India Off ice iSxpresa Letter iso#^*^* \ 3960/37 of the 3rd July 1937, on tne subject of a forward policy in Kuwait, which was further discussed at an informal ^ p* ' I ^ 4 Interdepartmental Meeting on tne lath May. In paragraph 3 of that telegram my views are asked in the light of my dis cussion with tne ienior HaVal Officer which I have now had an opportunity of doing* As the Meeting was an informal one 1 am making my comments demi-officially. 2 # With regard to my discussion with Poland - the Senior Haval Officer - I enclose a copy of a demi-official letter which I think puts the matter clearly from point of view, 3. H end el in his Memorandum and at the Interdepartmental Meeting advanced views wnicn can I think be summarised as follows. In the first place he empnasised tne importance of Kuwait from tne political and strategical aspect. I entirely agree with tnia. As Rendel reminded tne Meeting we are already committed to the defence of Kuwait by land, i originally put forward the view that we were so comitted (vide paragraphs -f' , 7 - 11 of ay demi-official letter Uo.l36o -3 of tile 2&amp;tli .ik *• October 1933 to Secretary of State for India, copy fonrarded to the Government of India under Printed Letter jso . 1366-S of ^ &lt;rs same date). the India Office concurred (vide paragraphs 4 and 5 of their letter Mo.P.£.7683/33 of the 1st February 1934 to the / J.O# 7alton laquire, CB. ,MC., The India Office, London.5. / -2- th« yortign Office)# &amp;&amp; cilcl tae foreign Office (Tide paragraph 7 of their letter Mo.775/739/91 of the 24th February 1934 to the India Office). I presume that this conetitutes a decision lay His IfaJ esty's aorernment, and that the Serrice Bepartmaats, who would have to carry out tne defence, realise their res ponsibilities in this direction 7 If there is any doubt on this important point I suggest that it be cleared up# Apart from this coiaraitment Kuwait is strategically and politically important as its front iers run with those of ♦ Iraq ana ;iaudi Arabia© It is also on the British air route to India and beyond (the Gulf is now the *Suea Canal of the Alr«) # and the possibility of oil being found there adds to its importance, especially in view of the fact that the other main supply of oil in the aulf # with the exception of Bahrain, is situated in a foreign country - Iran. (Hendel stressed this point). %b 4. On the subject of Kuwait Oil Rend el remarked (paragraph '\ 9 of his Memorandum)i *The fact that British oil interests allowed an American oil company to obtain so large a share in exploiting the oil possibilities of Kuwait has considerably strengthened the Shaikh's hands'*. Whether this has, or has not, strengthened the snaiJcn' s hands surely the responsibility is not entirely that of British oil interests V ^hen the Gulf (,4jaerican) Oil Company competed for tne Kuwait concession with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company His Majesty's Government decided not to stand on the ^hailch's agreement with them that he would not give an oil concession without their sanction* and permitted free competition. Tf His Majesty*3 Jovernment had told the 3haiJch that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company ne would nave done so. ( I ^p. |lf pointed this out at an Interdepartmental Meeting held on October ath 1933).7. / -3-7^ 5# Handel farther advocated that a more forward policy should be adopted in Kuwait with the following objects i A« To obtain more control over the ^haiich of KU #a it • B. To prevent the absorption of ISiwait fey either 1 Iraq or Saudi Arabia# C« To provide an alternative air base at Kuwait in the event of our position in ♦Iraq being materially impaired. As a first step in this forward policy Mendel suggested the establishment at Kuwait of a small Maval Station consist ing of a canteen and recreation ground, and a Royal Air ^orce base corresponding in size to the Maval Station* 6« lUth regard to the purpose underlying A. As 1 under stand it Kendel # s chief end in advocating more control over the Shaikh was for us to be in a position to induce the latter to come to terms with ♦ Iraq and Saudi Arabia on the various quest ions j Blockade, Smuggling etc. over which tnere is dis agreement, I agree with Hendel that it is unfortunate that these differences should exist, but I also entirely agree with the India Office views (as given by you at the Meeting) that the best my of establisning our influence over the Shaikh would be to implement our promise and assurance to the latter in the matter of the i&gt;at e liar dens and the Saudi Blockade respectively. If it is a case of bargaining, that is to say if for example of his own free will in order to induce the Iraqis to settle tne 3ate (Jarden question the Shaikh is prepared to assist in the smuggllng f then that is one thing. X am, however, definitely opposed, as you are aware, to bringing pressure on the shaikh for the benefit of either •Iraq or Saudi Arabia without his obtaining any corresponding benefit for himself.7, With regard to the first step in a forward policy tmt Mendel proposes in order to attain his three object8 f i«e« the establishaient of sraall Maval and Koyal Air Foroe stations with canteen and recreation facilities. 1 am afraid tnat I entirely disagree with Bend el f (with whom de aaury apparently generally concurre&lt;l), that the establishment of such stations would have ai?y practical effect at all towards the desired objects* while his view that fey the presence of these Stations ^tne psychologi cal effect would be considerable' 1 seems to me definitely far fetched, ?ifty years ago there raignt have been something ia lendel's general contention tnat in order to support British rights and interests in Kuwait one must necessarily have a snow of armed force there, but this is hardly the case to-day# i 8. to turn in detail to the objects which Kendel has in view. a. More control over the Shaikh. whatever may be the purpose to which this control is put (see paragraph 6 above) personally i cannot see that the Stations will have any effect whatever on the Shaikh towards this end, as I have pointed out before the Rulers of the Arab Coast, (and particularly the Shaikh of Kuwait), are no longer in tne 'bead and bludgeon* age, when they could be successfully cajoled by tne offer of a bag of beads in one hand, and a flourisn from a thick stick in the other, they are fully alive to tine fact tmt tney are living in post-mr not pre-War days. They icnow something about the principles of tne League of nations, and the moral rights of small States. In particular tney are well conversant with their Treaties with His Majesty^ Government, and nave a pretty snrewd guess as to what tne latter can, and more particularly wnat tney ca^t, do to tnem. This being so 1 cannot /- a - ~(W/ cannot see wnat over-awing etrect (If tnls is wnat Mendel means) the ^frequent presence of Britisix sailors on snore 11 proceeding peacefully on tneir lawful occasions to play foot ball on their recreation ground, or to sla&amp;e tneir tnirst at the canteen, would have either on tne Shaikh or his people, fe have got not a small, but a fairly large, Haval Base at Bahrain and an important aerodroiae and fortified Hest House at Sharjan, but these are mere facilities and give me as Resident no more w control 11 over the shaikhs of Bahrain and Sharjah than I nad before they existed. the same would be the case with any similar facilities obtained at Kuwa it. 9. (1). B. The prevention of the absorption of Kuwait by either 1 Iraq or Saudi Arabia. i naturally entirely agree that this danger should be met, but 1 am not of opinion that tne establishment of the small stations in question would make our position in Kuwait vis a via either of these two Powers any different to what it is now. we are not dealing with a parcel of Saudi or Iraqi Bedouin tribes who might be impressed by a show of armed force in Kuwait, but with the Governments of two countries in treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, wao are perfectly aware of our position in that State. Our insurance against tne absorption of Kuwait by either of these two Powers does not - in my opinion - rest on the establishment of a local show of armed forces but on tne fact that botn the Powers concerned know that by our Agreements with tne Bhaikh we nave a very special position tnere, which position we intend to maintain, and that if necessary we are prepared /i m$m prepared to protect Kuwait by force (see para graph 2 abore). (2)* In connection with this danger of afceorption the following remarSce of H end el at tne Meeting tnough tney #ere not ^iecaaaed, appear to me to raise a very serious is suet ,&lt; Mr &gt; lendel pjintea out that our treaty relationship witn the 3haikn was at present vague and uncertain# there was no clear and comprehensive treaty binding him to the Britisn connexion, and we might find our- ^ * selves on very poor legal ground for object ing if he were to confront us with a fait eccompl i « Mr« K end el considered tnat it was by no means impossible that the ^hai^h mignt negotiate a secret agreement with Ifen &amp;aud f accepting &amp;audi suzerainty but retaining a large measure of autonoia^ while Ibn Baud was unlikely to fall in ^ith such a sugges tion at present, he might easily do so If matters went wrong in Pal est ine and Anglo- Saudi relations were to deteriorate# vere we to be confronted with such a treaty, our position would be very difficult, and it might be practically impossible to recover our position in Kuwait without the use of force or without quarrelling with Ibn Saud# # I do not know whether His Maj esty 1 s iovernment agree with H end el* s assumption that the two Rulers in question could make such a treaty. Personally I feel inclined /2.2^ inclined to doubt it # the position as regards our control over the foreign relations of Kuwait was dealt with in paragraphs 3 - 5 of my letter Mo. 191-3 of the 5th liarch 193b to Metcalfe, particularly in paragraph 5 of that letter. Tnere is tne gap in our control referred to tnerein - tnat tne Shaikh, unliice tne Hulers of the otner onalkhdoms, can cosamunicate with Foreign Huler8 f but it is a long step from that to his naring tne power to make a treaty such as Hendel sbiggests, and I snould hare tnougat tnat the Shaikn*s obligations to us as outlined in paragraph 5 of my letter just quoted prevented him by implica tion from entering into any such agreement. Besides tnese definite obligations tnere are tne points noted by Hyan in paragraph 2 (a) (b) and (c) of his Mote of 31st January 1936 enclosed with Jedda Printed Letter 1100 235/380/27 of tne 4th February 193 6. A decision by His Majesty's Government as to whether the Shaikh can or cannot make a treaty with Ibn Saud, or for the matter of that with any otner foreign Ruler, should I suggest be come to as soon as possible. A reference to tne Law Officers of the Crown might be advisable ? I May add tnat if the Shaikh of Kuwait can make treaties with Foreign Hulers so, it seems to me, can all tne otner Arab Hulers of the Gulf - unless Rend el bases his view solely on the fact tnat the Shaikh of Kuwait can' comniunicate with foreign Hulers, since in other respects their obligations to us are the same ag Kuwait, no more and no less. (Besides the gap referred /-a- referred to above tnere is the exception tnat British subjects have not the right to live in Kuwait - vi&lt;ie paragraph 2 (a) of my letter ao.507*8 of the 7th July ' 1936 to Metcalfe, copy sent to tne India Office under .1$ Printed Letter Mo d Db8*3 of same date - and that we have no Slave Treaty with Kuwait, but tnese have no bearing on the present issue)* It may be, however, that H end el bases his view on the fact that our relations with Kuwait consist of various agreements instead of a 'clear and comprehensive treaty*# I agree tnat a treaty would be tidier, and perhaps more imposing, but surely the present agreements are equally binding on tne Bhaijch so far as they go ? If His MaJesty^s Government, however, decide tnat our agreements do not prevent the aaaiKh from maicing treaties with foreign Powers, I do not quite see how the establishment of small is aval and Eoyal Air force Stations is going to help us materially. Our action, X imagine, would ratner taKe tne line of trying to rectify our agreements. 0« fhe establishin of an alternative air base at Kuwait in tne event of our position in 1 Iraq being materially impaired # ^ It may be that this eventuality may come to pass, but a Naval Station does not enter intot his picture. As far as tne establishment now of a small Hoyal Air Force base is concerned, this seeuss to be a matter for tne Hoyal Air jforce to decide having regard to tneir share of tne responsibility for the defence of Kuwait (see paragraph 3 above}, and to the desirability of obtaining an option for a/11- Stations would nave ar^y of tne Political or psycnologU eel eff eots which he anticipates (paragraphs 7 - 10)# (d) It follows from this that if any ¥aval or Royal Air Force Stations are established at Kuwait, in iny oplnioa this action should toe taken purely on the strat«gic or recreational merits of such stations, of which the Haval and Hoyal Air Force authorities are the best judges, (paragraph 11), (e) Certain steps in the way of a quiet forward policy at Kuwait, have already been taken, and I do not think anything of a more forward nature is either necessary or desirable (paragraph 12). (f) I presume that His Majesty^ Government nave finally decided that they are responsible for the defence of Ku -m ix. If, however, tnere is ary doubt on this important point I suggest it should be cleared up (paragraph 3). (g) I also suggest that a definite decision should be made on the serious issue as to whether the Shaikh of Kuwait, baring regard to his obligations to us under his treaties and our special position in Kumit can or cannot make treaties with Foreign Powers (paragraph 9 (D). # I am sending copies of this 1 etcer to Parsons ana de Qaury. ♦ ''.021't p—J-p ri 'j 0+-!- ^O .C/* 11 ' 7 !

I aldo saw the building put up by the Bahrein Petrol^fc Co* They were generally very much on the small side and have not got the deep verandahs, which the report implies except on one side 0 Economy has been effected in room space by having a central cooling apparatus connected up to each residence with a radiator in each room. Gold brine is circulated throughout the system and apparently forms a miniature ice berg on the radiator, I should think this system is dangerous, as it must be difficult to adjust the cooling and humidity and these must bear some distinct relation to one another and to the conditions outside to render living in the rooms comfortable and safe. It would be interesting to ILnow if there were many cases of pneumonia or other pulmonary diseases at the oil fields during this hot weather. It m&amp;ist be remembered that these buildings have been run up to acconasodate a staff, who are onlyr equired for a short period of possibly 5 years during the drilling of th|well3, so the obvious thing is to have them small and *4^only way to make a small house liveable in is to adopt some artificial means of refrigeration. As an instance of the lavish way the Petroleum Co, spend money, the carpenters employed on the wood work of the buildings were Americans imported by air for the latter part of the Journey from Europe, I admit the buildings look nice rather after the styie of the small seaside bungalows one sees dotted all over,,.V (t^j - 2 • over the South Coast of England, and I think for the temporary purpose for which they have been put up they are ideal. They cannot, howeZver, be taken as a standard to which we should attain. The report rather contradicts itself, because in paragraph 56 it condemns the Govemmont of India buildings in the Gulf, and then in paragraph 57 praises the local architecture such as 11 large central courtyards' which the Government of India buildings previously followed; I personally saw no graceful native plaster and as fox- straight lines the horizon is the straightest line in the Gulf, The main object of architecture is to combine a pleasing design with comfort and convenience of layout, Arab buildings are constructed primarily for defence and isolation and everything else is sacrificedjto it. Hence only one exist and the requisite courtyard which has been so much admired. In order to obtain the maximum of comfort, every living room should face the prevailing breeze, thus ensuring a through draught. Therefore it is essential that the building should be spread out across the breeze. Regarding Koweit, this was designed in the rough by Hussell, but the detail necessarily had to be left to the man on the spot - an Assistant Engineer under the direct orders of the Political Resident, This is an unsatisfactory 1 my and gives the Architect no opportunity to control things, and Russell very wisely made things as simple as possible, Bie report is wrong about the yellow brick, which heim porous and underbumt does not retain heat to the same extent as atone. Actually this building struck me as being on the cool side when I visited it in April 1.935, Modern- 3 - Modern sanitation is not general in India, so it is not surprising that it has not been adopted in the Gulf. It is quite possible there, but sea water for flushing is not the easy cmtter assumed unless raw sewage is to be dis- oharged directly into the sea to contaminate the surrounds to the buildings. Sea water a^ain sounds very nice to one, who does not have to use it continuously for baths, and the Royal Navy would not go to the pains they do to give their crews fresh water for baths if there were not objections to it. For other reasons, the sea water at Bahrein could not be used f because the jetties in close proximity to the Residence are used as latrines. I am glad that you have given us this opportunity of seeing the criticisms, and I trust I have answered them % to some extent and that I have convinced you that things are not so bad as they are painted. i 1 Yours sincerely, 3d, A.

AH the sou of one aronitect, am tne brother of anotner, I have been considerably amused by tnis correspondence and you may be interested to gatner tne impressions of another new-comer to the Middle TSast 2 Personally I rather admire the Government of Indian old buildings in tnis region. Tney are very airy, solid and substantial and nave splendid verandahs. It should be remembered too that Hendel saw tne Gulf in tne cola weather, and that it ia for tne hot weatner tnat buildings nere chiefly require to be made suita bLe. Though not beautiful, buildings such as the Bushire 'Residency and the Bahrain Agency are simple and unpretentious and built to endure. I nave not seen tne Kuwait Agency. The larger Bapco buildings in Banrain are good enough, but the small ones, though air-conditionea, are, as Croaa implies, Itorribie little vilXaa to the eye and will certainly not last. They have however various Conveniences sucn as electric air-cooling, as regards wnich I think tne P.W.B. might take some lessons.

Croad's remarks regarding the use of sea-water for flushing seem to have reason behind them, but I do agree witn Render that in this age, when we erect new buildings as at Kuwait, some water-drainage system ought to be devised. But even here it has to be remembered that repairs are difficult in tnese backwaters, and tae sweeper cannot go out or order. n53/87 'IblJ I ndia Office D^O.Letter Ho.P.I.. 7459/36, d .S9.10.36. P.R.
